Though second half is improved and they use it to lure the audience to a false sense of security cause season 2 is awesome and totally obliterates the tropes from season 1.\n* First half of season 3 is a mess. Mix of problems off screen and on screen. Lack of communication. Plots randomly dialling up to 11 without any warning. You know there is issues when the showrunner literally has to go on podcasts and explain character motivations which should have been explained on screen or at least hinted.  Second half is pretty good.\n* Season 5: first 5 episodes are okay. but the characters are complete 180 from what they were in previous seasons. Most of the characters are completely unrecognizable. Abby's arc in particular, is so tone deaf. The only somewhat good character arc in 5 is Octavia's. The last few episodes limp to the finish line.",

Quite a few on reddit found out a lot of the shows reveals by the second or third episode of season 1 and this killed the mystery for many because by the end they knew what was going to happen.  \n\nSo with season 2, when it was about to be released, I knew there were red flags when the showrunners of westworld released a video with the synopsis: \"Since you figured out most of the plot of season 1. We figured we will give you a video explaining the plot of season 2 and leave it to you to guard the shows secrets\".  What followed was a 1 minute synopsis of the first minute of season 2. Followed by Evan Rachel Wood singing \"never gonna give you up\" and after that, 20 minutes of a dog sitting beside the Westworld piano. Yep. You heard that right...the showrunners of Westworld, in response to season 1, followed it up with a rickroll ...that and purposely making season 2 as complicated as hell so that no one could figure it out.",

The only two characters in the show whos growth we can experience and relate to, stop growing.\n\n\nThe last two seasons of the office are borderline awful;\nThe showrunners scrambling for dear life to replace the presence of Steve Carell and failing miserably; shoving in guest actor after guest actor after guest actor, in an attempt to stall until the finale.\n\nIt's not just Michael Scott that is missing from the office but much of the office dynamics that made the show what it was are gone, it's almost as if the writers forgot how to do what they were doing for almost a decade.",

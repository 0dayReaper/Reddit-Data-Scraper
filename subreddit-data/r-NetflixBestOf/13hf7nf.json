The final scene really had me crying so hard and I hardly cry over a show. Their love was really the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen. I really want a show that can top that or else I won\u2019t be able to move on from it.",

So beautiful and sad.\n\nAnd a tv show that is sad but in a different way, more related to the time period is [North &amp; South](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_%26_South_(TV_serial)) (2004) set in northern england, a girl and her family move there from the south and have to adapt to an industrial town and the people, really interesting dealing with class issues, the main guy is the owner of a mill.",

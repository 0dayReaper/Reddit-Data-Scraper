I liked it when Spottswoode delivered it, but as a way of convincing the audience to let them stop Kim Jong Il, it just seemed out of place and not in line with the fact it seemed like Gary was going to have do the acting of his life in order to match up with his hero, Alec Baldwin. There wasn't much acting involved delivering that speech.",

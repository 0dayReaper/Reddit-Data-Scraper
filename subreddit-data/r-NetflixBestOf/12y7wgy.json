I\u2019ve watched and thoroughly enjoyed Californication, Rake (Australian version), and Loudermilk. I\u2019m hoping to get more recommendations from y\u2019all, doesn\u2019t have to be Netflix specifically. Bonus points for an excellent soundtrack. I\u2019m kidding about that though, I don\u2019t have any points to give out.",

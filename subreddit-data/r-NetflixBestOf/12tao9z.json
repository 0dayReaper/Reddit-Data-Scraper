    "postText": "Hey, can anyone recommend some interesting french series? Where everyone speaks french but is possible to watch with english subtitles (I'm learning french so I find this way of learning more fun and effective). It can be on other platforms than Netflix, but most importantly that I could watch them for free haha. I already watched and really enjoyed SKAM France, also just finished Transatlantic with a lot of french dialogues. I've found many other series but they aren't on Netflix and it's impossible to watch it anywhere for free. Any recommendations? Prefered genres: drama, romance, thriller but I'm open to any suggestions \ud83d\ude04",

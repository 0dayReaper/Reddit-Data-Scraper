I swear I remember seeing a scene with Queen playing or something. \n\nI'm a sucker for that kind of thing. A lot of people knock it, but usually when it's hip hop for some reason. I love when a period film uses modern music though.\n\nEdit: Just looked it up and yeah, it uses We Are the Champions among other classic rock tracks. As well as Lowrider by War, which sounds *bananas* to include in a medieval period pic. I'm on board.",

I\u2019ll chalk it up partially to teenage jealousy (Heath Ledger doesn\u2019t get any hotter than this film for me), but I just find her character so... flat. That might not be entirely her fault, but if your script isn\u2019t bringing much life to your character, I think it\u2019s up to the actor to make up the difference. I actively disliked her in this film and kept wanting Heath to end up with her handmaiden.",

            "comment": "Everything is Illuminated -- considered a comedy/drama, there's a lot of black humor, which is my jam. The cinematography is amazing. As it follows Elijah Wood's character, a quirky Jewish-American, on a journey through the back roads of rural Europe to find the woman who saved his grandfather's life during WW II and the Holocaust. The band Gogol Bordello makes an appearance and the lead singer, Eugene H\u00fctz plays a main character. He's hilarious in this role. \n\nSilence of the Lambs -- oldie but goodie, it's basically the bar I've set for most movies. It's one of few that hits on almost every genre and also one of only three movies to win the big five at the Oscars (Best leading Actor; Best Leading Actress; Best Director; Best Writing Screenplay; Best Sound). It's a movie I can watch time and again. \n\nBirdman -- if you like dark and quirky humor. I laughed out loud all the way through it, *in the theater*",

Hopefully it\u2019s still on Netflix, but it\u2019s Called Metastasis, and it is a shot for shot, line by line recreation of Breaking Bad with Hispanic actors.  The story beats change slightly to accommodate the main setting being Mexico, but it is spoken in Spanish.  Since you already know the story and scenes of Breaking Bad, your brain is primed to fill in knowledge gaps based on the context it already knows from watching Breaking Bad.\n\nI was a Spanish major and watching this show (and reading Harry Potter in Spanish) helped me as much as any class did.",

Same for Michael Mando, again fitting in well with his character's story.\n\nThere's a lot of children of latinos raised in the US who do not speak Spanish with ease - that doesn't mean that they don't speak Spanish or even that they speak it incorrectly.\n\nFor me, the big issue was choosing actors who could not affect the correct accents or who did not seem to want to be bothered with doing it.  If British actors can imitate a US accent and vice versa, then someone should have asked the grandmother to at least attempt to sound Mexican, a more likely nationality for the location.",

Miami Vice\n\n-Oh, and since Narcos has been brought up several times. Narcos Mexico is also really good, and the accents are a little more authentic since most of the Spanish speaking characters are portrayed by Mexican actors.",

It won Best Picture and it's not difficult to see why. You might to have unfurl your sails to watch it in the States.",

The Fistful of Dollars trilogy; Once Upon a Time in the West; Outlaw Josey Wales. There are others, too, but that's where I'd start.",

It has a packed cast including Gene Hackman, Sharon Stone and Leo DiCaprio.\n\nI highly recommend Taylor Sheridan's \"new western\" trilogy.  They are grim, and they are set in the present.  If you've seen No Country for Old Men, it's more that type of vibe.  Sheridan is a juggernaut now with his Yellowstone stuff, but I think his storytelling is much better in movie format with the time constraints involved.  The movies are Sicario, Hell or High Water, and Wind River.  Personally, Hell or High Water is my favorite.\n\nSicario is dark, and deals with cartel violence.  Wind River isn't as dark, but does deal with sexual assault.  Hell or High Water is probably the lightest of the three, but only by comparison.",

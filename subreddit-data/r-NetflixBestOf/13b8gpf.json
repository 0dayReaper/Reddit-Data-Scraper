Wright was talking about his rules of comedy, one of which being no cussing.  He said it's not about wanting to be clean or PG, but that cussing can make a joke funnier than it really is and get a bigger laugh than the joke deserves.  He basically said he wants the joke to get the appropriate response based on how funny the idea is, not on saying a cuss word.",

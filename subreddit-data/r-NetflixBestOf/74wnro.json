For whatever negative it has done for his family, it feels like the positives outweigh them. Even his sons both have great careers following in his footsteps. It may not be a typical arrangement, but they look to be living happy lives.",

I don't think it even occurred to his sons to wish that he worked less -- that's how engrained the principles of working and productivity are in that society. \n\nRather, I think it's Jiro's unyielding demands and expectations for absolute perfection that has created some resentment (maybe too strong a word) or bitterness on his sons' behalf. Sushi is all-consuming in his life and he expected that same level of passion, obsessiveness, and dedication from his sons when they went into the field. That's a really difficult standard to live up to, especially when your dad is absolutely at the top of his field and he not only expects you to live up to his level of skill and understanding but wants you to continue and exceed that legacy. The impression I got was that Jiro doesn't think Yoshikazu will be able to do both, and possibly even sadder is that Yoshikazu appears to know that too. ",

It's an experience unlike anywhere you'll go (for the most part) in USA - like watching Picasso painting in person. I'm sure there are cheaper options in Japan that are very good as well, but if you want to experience something similar to Jiro, this is your best bet. He trained with him over a decade and the attention to detail, rice and fish are unreal ",

Then I had a steak so good that all other steak tasted like crap in comparison. I didn\u2019t eat steak for two years, until the memory of the other place had faded. \n\nIt really is possible to make continuous incremental improvements in the ingredients and preparation of a dish to the point where it passes \u201creally good\u201d and approaches \u201cthe ideal of what the dish should be\u201d. \n\nSome people are into food the way some people are into mechanical keyboards or sneakers or vinyl albums, saving their money to try and sample the very best the genre has to offer. The difference is, as you point out, that food is an art form that begins to decay instantly at the point of creation, and cannot be saved to be shared later, only described. \n\nBut if you don\u2019t care, you don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care about sneakers myself, but I\u2019m okay with the fact that some people can tell the difference and are happy to spend hundreds of dollars on something that doesn\u2019t seem that much different than the kind you can buy for $50 at Target. They\u2019ve educated themselves on sneakers to the point where they can appreciate and enjoy subtle nuances that I would miss. But I\u2019m not going to shit on their hobby, because I know that they\u2019re seeing something I\u2019m not. \n\nEverybody should have a hobby that brings them happiness. For me, that\u2019s food. For others, it\u2019s sneakers. I hope you have a hobby that brings you happiness too! ",

Let's say a pound of good beef costs you 8 dollars. And a pound of beef prepared by a good chef cost you 40 dollars.\n\nDoes high grade beef and the work of a good chef warrant a 500% markup? Probably yes. It is a marked improvement over your home cooked meal most likely. A pound of wagyu beef might run you 250 bucks and it's great. But is it 3150% better than a good piece of regular beef from your own kitchen?\n\nProbably not. At that point you're not paying for the quality of the food. You're paying for the fairytale surrounding the food. And it's up to you if you're actually into good food or being able to tell a good story.\n\nPersonally, I don't believe there's any such thing as 250$ sushi that can stand on its own qualities as a meal. But I'm positive there are people who are happy to buy into a 250$ fairytale they can tell others.\n\nIn other words, I don't believe there's any such meal that will pass a blind taste test and have people put the price point on it that it fetches when the story is woven around it.",

I really wonder if everyone who has spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars at these places claim it is so fantastic to really just justify the amount of money they actually spent and try to fool themselves that it really was such top level food.",

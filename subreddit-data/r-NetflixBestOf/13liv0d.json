I liked Happy and imaginary friends a lot better as just unexplained plot devices, like the time travel in *Outlander* for the most part, used as a mysterious and convenient vehicle to tell interesting and grounded if still really weird stories. S2 started exploring imaginary friends and went super deep into full-on fantasy super quickly and that's when it just lost me. I still watched the whole thing, but... Mostly out of a desperate hope it'd get better or I'd otherwise start to enjoy it. Nope.",

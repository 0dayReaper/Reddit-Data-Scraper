Characters who have dreams get them horribly twisted. \n\n* Jenny wanted to be a famous singer/performer but all she accomplished was performing in a Strip Club. \n\n* Lt. Dan was supposed to die in Vietnam, but instead he lost his legs. \n\n* Bubba wanted to captain a shrimping boat, and have Forrest be his first mate; instead he died and now Forrest is the captain. \n\nForrest never really made plans, and all of the things that changed his life were completely spontaneous/serendipitous. \n\n* He got a scholarship to Alabama because he was running away from bullies. \n\n* He goes to the Olympics as an indirect result of playing PingPong that one time.  \n\n* He lets Lt. Dan invest his money and that gave Forrest more money than he could ever dream of. \n\nForrest doesn't chase anything, things come in and out of his life without his control. He only wanted Jenny, but he never chased her. She was always the one to come to him. But at the end of the movie, where Forrest finally achieves his \"destiny\" by marrying Jenny; it too, gets twisted. Jenny dies, but he raises their child together.\n\n\nThink about the feather in the movie, it floats around, letting the wind take it. The feather symbolized Forrest, as he was the one who caught it in the movie.\n\n\nTLDR; ~~There is no destiny~~ You have no control over your destiny. Let life take you wherever it will, enjoy the ride.",

He is loathed, bullied, goes through a horrific war, is constantly denied affection by the only person who ever cared for him as a person, and is confounded at ever turn by a world with motivations that he cannot fathom.\n\nBut *he* is happy. He's in a situation that most people wouldn't consider good and wouldn't be happy in, but due to the combination of his personality, parenting, and mental handicap, he doesn't care. He's okay anyway. For the most part, whenever something bad happens, he either doesn't really realize it or just moves on from it.\n\nThis raises an interesting point, which is addressed more directly in the book *Flowers for Algernon* (about a handicapped man who receives an experimental treatment to increase his IQ). If being mentally handicapped means you're happier because you don't always understand what people say or what has happened...are you better off happy but unaware or aware but unhappy? And also, is there a difference between being happy because of this lack of understanding versus understanding and being happy anyway? It's certainly harder to be happy when you can comprehend how awful things can be, but is the end result any different?",

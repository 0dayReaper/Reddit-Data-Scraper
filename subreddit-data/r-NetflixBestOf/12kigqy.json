Bruce Lee and Kareem were slowed down A Lot \ud83d\ude02 so you could see what they were doing in the unreleased scene in game of death. The Raid and it's ungodly sequel simply brought that back in spades. Hell even the old Shaw brothers movies had better choreography than a long list of brand name movie actors over easily the last 20-30 years and not just Steven Seagal movies either.",

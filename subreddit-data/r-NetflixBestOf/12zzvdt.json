It\u2019s kinda of got a similar vibe to Wednesday I would say\n\nLockwood and Co is pretty similar to Stranger Things and Wednesday\n\nI would say TVDU. So like The Vampire Diaries, The Originals and Legacies. I never got into The Vampire Diaries and I stopped watching Legacies but I did really enjoy The Originals and it stands on its own you don\u2019t have to watch the other shows",

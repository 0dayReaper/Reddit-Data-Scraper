The hyper-realistic \"you're there in the patrol car with them\" feel was the best part, and once it transitioned away from reality and into movieland, it suffered.\n\nBut still fantastic overall, perfectly acted, and stunning direction. 8/10, highly recommended.",

If there were a class about how and when to reference a previous plot point or event for comedic effect, Hot Fuzz would be the first homework assignment.   \n  \n*Everything* in the first half of this film is a setup to something that pays off later, yet it never feels like a setup and is perfectly entertaining on its own. Then the call-backs start flying and it's fucking hilarious.   \n  \nJust like in a good mystery (which this movie also somehow is), when seemingly mundane things become crucial later on, what feel like throw-away lines and quips actually become very funny later (e.g. Aaron A Aaronson is a real person).",

You have the mastermind asshole, the Bonnie and Clyde duo, the crazy unpredictable guy, and the driver. And the girlfriend doesn't really contribute to the plot in a significant way except to provide motivation for Baby. \n\n\nI'm still processing my thoughts on this, but in the moment I kind of took it as an intentional move by Wright. Could totally be wrong but it wouldn't be the first time he focused on tropes. Heck, Hot Fuzz is my favorite movie of all time because it makes fun of the 90's cop movie tropes while at same time providing a compelling story and being hilarious. Shaun did same for zombie movies.  \n\nFor Baby Driver I was super hesitant I almost didn't see it. But to be totally honest that opening scene where he starts rocking out just totally changed any expectations I had for the movie and in that moment I had the thought, \"I'm definitely going to like this.\"   I loved the music, I thought the tracks did a great job of being surprising (not obvious picks) but somehow still working.  Not just the music but even in that beginning sequence (after the first heist) when he's getting coffee it really drove home to me that they *wanted* you to listen to the movie as much as watch it. That sounds so corny, I don't mean to.  \n\nI'm going to go see it again to see if my opinion changes. ",

Shaun did same for zombie movies.\n\nSee, that's what I was hoping Baby Driver WOULD do. Take the heist genre and subvert it. But he played it straight, and with that being said, he conformed to conventions instead of trying something new. You could argue the music cues is a new take, but again, it's a stylistic choice of telling a conventional tale rather than subverting the ENTIRE tale. I felt like I was watching an *insert generic action movie director here* toward the end, and there were too many moments where I felt he settled for the easy way out rather than doing something creative. People are saying BD was oh so stylish but it honestly felt so vanilla in parts. I've seen it twice too, and the second time didn't stray my opinion. It was a fun movie, don't get me wrong, but usually EW elevates massively above \"fun movie.\"\n\nHe put all those stereotyped movie characters in it, but he didn't really DO anything with them. He just played it like it was another heist movie. I'm not trying to shit on the movie, I'm just saying it was hollow in charm that is present in all his other movies.",

What's brilliant in this movie is that almost every line is a joke, a set up to a joke, or a call back to a joke. Then there's the visual comedy that Edgar Wright is very good with the transitions from scene to scene is down right brilliant. It's something you don't appreciate in one watch as is  everything Edgar Wright does it only gets better with every viewing all of his movies. I keep finding something new in them every time I watch them.",

Too good. So, he is transferred to a peaceful village in Sanford. He is doing so many spectacular jobs as a police officer except when he is paired with Constable Danny Buutterman, the son of Frank Butterman (who is the chief). But, when two actors are butchered to death by a black-hooded person, Nicholas begins to think that all these murders that are going around in Sandford and the policemen and women think they are accidents, he thinks that all these murders link to one thing.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n&gt; The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 91% approval rating with an average rating of 7\\.7\\/10 based on 199 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"The brilliant minds behind Shaun of the Dead successfully take a shot at the buddy cop genre with Hot Fuzz. The result is a bitingly satiric and hugely entertaining parody.\" It also has a Metacritic score of 81\\/100\\. Olly Richards of Empire praised the chemistry between Pegg and Frost, saying\\: \"After almost a decade together, they're clearly so comfortable in each other's presence that they feel no need to fight for the punchline, making them terrific company for two hours\". Johnny Vaughan of The Sun already called it the \"most arresting Brit-com of 2007\". Phillip French of The Observer, who did not care for Shaun of the Dead, warmed to the comedy team in this film. The film also received positive reviews in the United States. Derek Elley of Variety praised Broadbent and Dalton as \"especially good as Angel's hail-fellow-well-met superior and oily No. 1 suspect\". As an homage to the genre, the film was well received by screenwriter Shane Black. On Spill.com, it got their 2nd-highest rating of 'Full Price\\!\\!'.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Hot+Fuzz+%282007%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hot%20Fuzz), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hot_fuzz/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hot-fuzz), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70056431), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q729788).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F6mv9ym \"Confidence: 1.03\").

It can be a thriller with moments of genuine tension. It blends so many genres together, is directed perfectly, paced beautifully, quotable as hell, written with surgeon like precision, and the acting is fantastic. The plot is ACTUALLY engaging too. It's easily one of my favorite movies ever. Edgar Wright knows how to direct visual comedy so freaking well. He doesn't just line up actors in a  medium 2 shot. The visual storytelling is purely ingenious. Can ya tell I have a boner for this movie?",

Due to an issue with his father he is not.\n\nThe daughter has worked outside the business but returns, expecting to have as big as a piece of the pie.\n\nBoth involve the kids screwing themselves and each other over.",

So maybe that. At the very least is has a top five all time pilot. So you could just give it 50 minutes and make the call after.\n\nFinally, yeah, Breaking Bad. Just for overall quality. Then when you're done you can watch El Camino and Better Call Saul (Saul might even be something you'd like more)",

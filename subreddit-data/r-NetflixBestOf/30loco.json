It\u2019s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real\u2026 then it should be an animal now\u201d\n\nThe professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the \u201cpoor\u201d (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!\n\nThe students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named \u201cSmall Government\u201d flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.\n\nThe professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.\n\nSemper Fi. p.s. close the borders\n\n",

Like I love Dogma, and it's probably my favorite movie ever. But it's not trying to teach or preach.\n\nAnd there are plenty of shows that mention or have the concept of religion - Battlestar Galactica did this wonderfully imo. The Exorcist, too (haha).\n\nI guess it's just that if I'm looking for something spiritual, it's not to be entertained. And if I'm looking for entertainment, I'm not in the mood for the nitty gritty of theology (not that these movies ever get past the most shallow topics).",

A few of my friends were going through that  \"reborn\" phase that some people seem to go through in high school and were wildly fucking annoying. Watching a movie that really highlighted the underlying hypocrisy of some of those bible thumpers without being an over-the-top \"fuck you, religion\"  bash-fest was a nice surprise.",

But it's because I view my calling as making secular films that have underlying Christian values and messages. There's no point to make a movie that caters to Christians just to reaffirm what they already believe. There's literally an expression based on that: \"preaching to the choir\".  \n\nTake The Exorcism of Emily Rose for example. Directed by Scott Derrickson, who graduated from the film program at a Christian college. It's in my opinion one of the most well made horror movies I've seen, but it was also intended to expose audiences to the fact that there's two sides to the spiritual realm, rather than just the Satanic/demonic side. \n\nAnd then there's God's Not Dead and whatever Kirk Cameron's latest movie is. Terrible films that serve no real purpose. ",

I know some young Christians that like to listen to Joel Osteen and more of that prosperity shit  Christianity and it makes me sad because it's like eating from the dumpster behind a McDonalds that was recently closed because of an ebola outburst.  Same with this movie. It's a fantasy, not reality. It does not bring you closer to non=Christians or to God ... not at all ... it just alienate you from them. Makes you feel \"enlightened\" over these \"poor sad atheists\" who really are just \"closet christians who are angry with God\".  Well guess what, that's just not reality. This movie is just on the other side of the spectrum of where /r/atheism is. It would probably make both Jesus and Nietzsche facepalm.  This movie was just not an honest portrayal of humanity, unlike how the Bible portrays it. For instance, David one of the most famous characters in the Bible murdered a guy so he could get away with having sex with his wife. Thomas told his friends he could only believe when he could touch Jesus his wounds. (and Jesus gave him what he needed to believe.) Mozes was a murderer too, and Peter was very confident of himself and then weaseled out and lied about knowing his friend Jesus. Jesus did not came to make bad people good, he came to turn death people back to live. This movie is trash, made to satisfy a big demand in the USA  for crash, over- simplified, dishonest, feel-good Christianity. You know  ... the one where you go to heaven by posting Christian memes on face book and driving around with a bumper sticker. This type of Christianity is about the good feeling of being part of an inner circle that can look down on people outside of it.   Instead of just going out and meet people and threat them all equal, believer or nonbeliever, and show by your principles and actions that you believe and why you believe. I am not ashamed of my faith, and I am not insecure about it either. It does not depend on what the popular thing to do is. Or with the words of John the Baptist from Luke 3:7 (Message Bible) \n\n&gt; When crowds of people came out for baptism because it was the popular thing to do, John exploded: \u201cBrood of snakes! What do you think you\u2019re doing slithering down here to the river? Do you think a little water on your snakeskins is going to deflect God\u2019s judgment? It\u2019s your life that must change, not your skin. And don\u2019t think you can pull rank by claiming Abraham as \u2018father.\u2019 Being a child of Abraham is neither here nor there\u2014children of Abraham are a dime a dozen. God can make children from stones if he wants. What counts is your life. Is it green and blossoming? Because if it\u2019s deadwood, it goes on the fire.\u201d",

My initial though was \"oh fuck, this class is going to be awful.\" Turned out quite the opposite. He loved to play Devil's Advocate to the point that other religious people in the class got mad at him. He explained at the end of the semester he felt comfortable doing it because he was secure enough in his faith and pondered on those questions enough he felt fine talking about them, and others in the class should pursue their own truth. As an atheist I thought that was pretty cool. The only time I ever had a problem with his discussions in class when he \"disproved\" evolution by drawing punnet squares on the board and talking about how n\u00e9e traits can't be introduced.\n\nEDIT: I realize my initial response to him telling us he was a pastor may make me sound like an asshole. That was my response because he told us without a real reason to, so I thought it would affect class discussions. Obviously I was wrong, and he was a very objective professor. He iss actually one of my favorites. Definitely put my foot in my mouth on that judgement.",

When Josh refuses due to his own Christian beliefs, the Professor challenges him to defend his position that his God is real - which leads to a series of confrontational presentations between himself and the professor, with the class as jury. Josh's plans to go to law school depend on not failing this class. Josh's fellow Christian girlfriend urges him not to throw away his future with this meaningless action of defiance. At the same time, Pastor Dave and African missionary Jude attempt to leave town on a trip, but are hindered by curious incidents. Student Ayisha is at odds with her father's conservative Muslim religious principles. Hotshot businessman Mark acts cynically towards his mentally ill mother, while his famous leftist blogger girlfriend receives bad news from a doctor.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n---\n\n**Critical reception:**\n\n&gt; The film has been panned by critics, currently holding a score of 16 out of 100 on Metacritic indicating \"overwhelming dislike\", based on six critics, and a rating of 17% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews as of May 2014\\.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\n---\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?God%27s+Not+Dead+%282014%29), [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com\\/dataworld\\/freeq\\/job\\_6cf50b0b-5659-4545-bd53-dd269f729755\\_var\\_en\\_wikipedia\\_org\\_wiki\\_God$0027s\\_Not\\_Dead\\_$0028film$0029), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=40401100), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gods_not_dead/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gods-not-dead).  \n*I am a bot.*\n[Send me feedback](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F30loco \"Confidence: 1.03\").\n[Data sources and other information](/r/MovieGuide/w/about).\n",

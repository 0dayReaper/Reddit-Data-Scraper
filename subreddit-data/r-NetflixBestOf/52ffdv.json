The company I worked for at the time was a small interactive agency, no dress code, pretty casual. The owner essentially went out of his way to make the office a non-office, at least in terms of daily BS.\n\nThe only problem with that is that defining yourself as \"not that other thing\" doesn't work too well in my experience. In this case, the guy wanted us to be casual, but would make us dress up nicer any time a client visited. And he was just weirdly uptight about random things.\n\nAnyway, after working for him for a couple years, I took a job at a larger software company. Still pretty small though, and just as casual, though they embraced it unequivocally, rather than with hesitance. I knew this because I had a friend who worked there, and who'd referred me for the job.\n\nWhen I broke the news to my boss, he tried to tell me I was going to a world of corporate BS that would kill my spirit, or something like that. I was unmoved due to my insider information.\n\nOn my last day, we had a pizza party for lunch - we all sat in the conference room eating pizza and watching Netflix for an hour or so. Since it was my party, I got to choose the show. And I specifically chose Better Off Ted to kind of fuck with my boss and his perceptions about office culture.\n\nYeah, I can be a little passive-aggressive sometimes. But who cares, I got to watch Better Off Ted, and then I got a fat pay raise.",

The series ran on the ABC network from March 18, 2009 to January 26, 2010\\.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n&gt; Critics have praised Better Off Ted's witty and satirical humour, as well as its cast. According to Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the show's first season holds a score of 68 out of 100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\", based on 21 reviews. Misha Davenport of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote favorably of the show, comparing its characters to those of the highly acclaimed show Arrested Development. Linda Stasi of the New York Post gave the show three-and-a-half out of four stars, lauding the cast and simply referring to it as \"a very funny comedy\". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the show a B\\+, stating \"'Better Off Ted' is certainly the most original sitcom to come along in a while.\" Robert Bianco from USA Today referred to the show as \"well-cast and reasonably entertaining.\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?%22Better+Off+Ted%22+%282009%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Better%20Off%20Ted), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com//m/04jj3hb), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/tv/better-off-ted/season-2), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q832431).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F52ffdv \"Confidence: 0.91\").

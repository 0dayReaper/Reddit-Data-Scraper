If we're talking about females in combat in film, they usually cast a stick and then use special effects to try to convince us that she's exerting her 89 lbs. against 250 lbs. enemies. It's hard to believe at best, and destroys immersion at worst. \n\nBlunt looks fit as fuck in this film and is has (spoiler reasons) for her competence in combat. It works in this instance. ",

On the field he violently dies and wakes up on the army boat. This padder repeats itself until finally he decides to use his power to bring humanity to victory.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n&gt; Edge of Tomorrow received largely positive reviews from critics. Critics praised the humor, the aliens' design, the performances of Cruise and Blunt, and the time-loop premise's ability to remain fresh. However, some critics had issues with the film's conclusion. Based on 279 reviews, review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 90% of critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7\\.5 out of 10\\. The website's critical consensus reads\\: \"Gripping, well-acted, funny, and clever, Edge of Tomorrow offers entertaining proof that Tom Cruise is still more than capable of shouldering the weight of a blockbuster action thriller.\" Another aggregator Metacritic surveyed 43 critics and assessed 35 reviews as positive and eight as mixed, with none negative. Based on the reviews, it gave the film a score of 71 out of 100, which it said indicated \"generally favorable reviews\".\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Edge+of+Tomorrow+%282014%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edge%20of%20Tomorrow), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/live_die_repeat_edge_of_tomorrow/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/edge-of-tomorrow), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1187607).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4ig4kn \"Confidence: 1.03\").

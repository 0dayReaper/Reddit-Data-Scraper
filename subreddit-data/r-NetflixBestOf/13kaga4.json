If that\u2019s your thing, I recommend watching. \n\nI myself have a tough time sitting down and watching a movie. It has to capture my attention from the beginning till the end. I was pleasantly entertained.\n\nI think it works because it follows that romcom recipe and satisfying \u2014 not sure if that even makes sense!",

It's the reason a lot of people love romcoms and Hallmark movies, and formulaic movies in general. There is comfort in the familiar and predictable. But this movie was just different enough that it didn't feel too tired. I watched it and enjoyed it too - as you say it's cheesy yet charming.",

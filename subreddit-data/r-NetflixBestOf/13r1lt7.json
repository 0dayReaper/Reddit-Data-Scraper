    "postText": "XO Kitty was amazing! I am actually very pleased that they decided to go the tv show route vs movie route and gave us an unexpected season 1 (definitely need longer episodes!). I had no idea that this spinoff was even happening, and Kitty definitely holds her own without LJ (is Margot next?). I\u2019ve seen a few posts with people criticizing XO Kitty and that\u2019s perfectly fine. This post is for those of us who loved the show. I enjoyed being in the TATBILB universe - it\u2019s wholesome, it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s cheesy, and it\u2019s not too serious. I think every now and then we need a reminder of how good, and simple, life can be.\n\nI also want to take time to highlight that I appreciate how this film honored Asian culture. Aside from Crazy Rich Asians, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve watched a movie or tv show that had a predominately Asian cast. I will be checking out the other Asian shows on Netflix because of this experience. \n\nI can\u2019t wait to explore this new world of amazing stories.",

I like the music and multiple character plot lines but I feel like the characters either behave too unpredictably or too predictably and nothing in between. Stuff either magically works out, or doesn\u2019t and it leaves me feeling disconnected from the behaviors of the characters.\n\nI would say it\u2019s fun. Worth a watch. Especially if you enjoyed the movies (but probably not a strong requirement).",

Tsundere means a prickly, stuck up dude, and there's quite a few shows that do the trope of tsundere guy and upbeat girl he falls for after much ado.\n\nBoys over Flowers/Meteor Garden is the most well known because there's so many versions, but I don't like recommending it because in the Korean, Chinese, and Japanese versions the male lead is borderline abusive. \n\nAll of the following are on Netflix \n\nKorean: \n\nOur Beloved Summer\n\nMy Holo Love\n\nVagabond\n\nK2\n\nLove to Hate You\n\n\nI'm not sure if these technically count but I love them sooo:\n\nRain or Shine\n\nBackstreet Rookie\n\nHotel Del Luna\n\nAlchemy of Souls \n\nDodosolsollalasol\n\nChinese:\n\nLove Between Fairy and Devil\n\nAccidentally in Love\n\nFalling Into Your Smile \n\nUse for my Talent \n\nI'm not sure if these count buuuuut:\n\nLove 020\n\nHandsome Siblings\n\nWho Rules the World\n\nThe term tsundere is a Japanese term, and as such it'd be easier to list the shows that don't use the trope than ones that do. \n\nAs you maybe can guess I am overflowing with show recommendations so if you happen to watch and like any of these I would love to give you more!",

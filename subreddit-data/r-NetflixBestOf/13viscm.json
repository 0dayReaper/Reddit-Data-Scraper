But I got the same feeling as you, never really felt the gravity of the plot. I thought all the budget went into stunts and cgi and getting the characters right, not the overall plot. Seemed like a ride at Disneyland. Expensive, over the top, flashy, then it's over.\n\nEdit. I really did like the soundtrack tho. When the first song came on during the opening I was surprised and started enjoying myself.",

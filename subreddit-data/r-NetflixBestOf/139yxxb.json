    "postText": "About 4-5 years ago, I watched this series on my kids account (because I wasn't allowed to get an adult one until I was 13) and I'm not even sure it's on Netflix anymore so I need help cuz I kinda wanna watch it again. I think it might have been an anime? Or at least had the style. It gave Sailor Moon vibes (based on my memory) but I know it wasn't. Basically there was this group of teen girls who have colourful hair and they could turn these warrior thing and their costumes matched their hair. I think in one of the series they had these floaty companions, and no it wasn't Winx Club. I remember that one considering I watch Fate now. Oh and I think they fought these weird enemies who were always really random.",

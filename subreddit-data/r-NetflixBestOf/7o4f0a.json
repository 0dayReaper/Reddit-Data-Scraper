It's definitely different than Princess Bride though, agreed. I think it's because Princess Bride is more satirical of the genre while Stardust accepts it.",

And then I got to fall in love all over again as a teenager when I learned it was a book, and even better than the movie. \n\nWhereas I already loved the comics (Vess' artwork was just the perfect complement to Gaiman's story) and while the movie was certainly a worthy adaptation, it simply couldn't tie all the various threads together as masterfully as Gaiman did in the print version. I realize that it's a necessity due to time, but that's always going to be an issue when adapting a book. TPB had the benefit of being a movie to me first. \n\nPlus, TPB is eminently more quotable.

Both aim at fans, PB more to movie fans and SD to old fashioned fantasy fans. I love Gaiman, I think that the book and move of SD are incredible. But Goldman is literally letter perfect. We have amazing dialogue, perfect quips, twists and turns. We have a movie that is a perfect casting of the book and everything you see is almost unchanged from the book. If is flawless. SD is great but flawed many times. I get that DeNiro's portrayal is debated (I hate it) but the evil witch just fails to hit her marks.\n\n",

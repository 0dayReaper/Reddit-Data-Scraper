I've watched it twice now and I'm probably going to watch it again. I noticed little nuances every time I do. On the acting, if you look at the people that are playing the serial killers, see how much they look like the real people.\nEdmund Kemper's look alike is mind boggling \nIf I ever saw the actor on the streets, I would totally freak out and run.\ud83d\ude09",

            "comment": "I\u2019m going to do these of memory, so they might not be all on netflix:  \n\nAwake (2012) - story about a police officer (Jason Isaacs aka Lucius Malfoy) that lost his wife in a car crash. When he goes to sleep he wakes up in a different reality where his wife survived but his son died. He keeps alternating while he (and we) try to find out what is real and what isn\u2019t.  \nGot cancelled but the story can be considered finished. \n\n(Sorry, this one was sci-fi, but leaving it up here since I typed it already. Might interest others) Altered Carbon - technically has more seasons but season 1 is a finished story in it\u2019s own right and amazing. The story is about a private detective in a futuristic world and has some great criticisms of society.  \n\nInventing Anna - mini-series based on the real life story of a girl that may or may not have faked being a rich socialite. \n\n(Technically sci-fi but worth checking out as it might be grounded enough to interest you:)  \nWestworld - ran for more seasons, but season 1 can be viewed as its own story and you really don\u2019t need to continue after. You follow several visitors and a staff member of a western theme park filled with androids.\n\nTrue detective - has more than 1 season but every season is it\u2019s own story. Especially season 1 is amazing\n\nFargo - same deal. Every season is a story and season 1 is amazing! (And I still need to start with the others)\n\nAmerican Horror Story - a horror themed anthology show. I haven\u2019t watched all seasons but the first ones were very enjoyable\n\nThe Booth at the end - oddly interesting show about a man in a diner booth. People visit him to make deals and update him on what happened. It\u2019s an odd concept but was quite interesting.\n\nCasa del Papel - technically has 5 seasons but you can view it as two separate stories. I can really recommend the first story (s1+s2)\n\nHope you enjoy these suggestions! I know many technically don\u2019t fit but I think they follow the spirit of what you\u2019re looking for. A lot of the shows that stay under 2 seasons are sadly unsatisfactorily cancelled so that\u2019s why I included story collections and longer stories that can be cut into more bite-sized parts.",

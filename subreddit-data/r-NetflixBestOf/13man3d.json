I know, cuz I've lived on two of them.\n\n*Easy A, Marriage Story* &amp; *Julie &amp; Julie* were great. Didn't resonate with *La La Land.*",

It would probably be my top recommendation for anyone, not knowing their particular tastes.\n\nI liked *Reservation Dogs* a lot, although I haven't finished the second season (it's a bit heavy so I took a break, but I have been meaning to finish it for a long time). It's worth pointing out Waititi co-produced the series with Native American producers - you probably already know that almost all the producers, directors and creators are indigenous, I think most are Native American/Canadian. But if you liked Reservation Dogs and you are interested in other work by Waititi, I'd additionally recommend his movie [**Boy (2010)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP05fUP9xAo), which I believed is more directly inspired by Waititi's childhood/community. Boy is one of his first movies, I believe. I haven't seen it yet, though it's on my watchlist.  It looks like it's free to stream on PLEX, and with an account on Showtime.",

I don't know of Bohemian Grove, although it sounds vaguely familiar. I just googled the wikipedia and it feels familiar. I'm sure I have heard of it before...\n\nSounds super gross and ripe for satirizing. Should be funny. Like I said though, from what I understand, Sterlin Harjo is as much or more the creator of the show, and there are a bunch of other writers.",

So I watched 10 minutes and realised how the media must have paid for the story to attract people to watch it. It is a b movie and the stabbing is nothing compared to what we see in teen movies, serious, who to trust these days regarding movie reviews. Watch teen wolf and you will see this movie is weak.",

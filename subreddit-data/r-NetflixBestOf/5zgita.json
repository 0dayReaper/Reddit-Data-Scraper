They sold some high dollar tickets to go to the premiere and then Brad spoke before the movie in each of six or so screens. It all sold out and all these people in their fancy clothes came to see Brad, so naturally as high schoolers we were curious and went to check it out. \n\nTheater was locked down unless you had a ticket and everyone just assumed the whole theater was taken over. It wasn't. We bought Waterboy tickets, stood with all the people that overpaid to see Meet Joe Black, saw Brad Pitt from the same distance they did, and then saw Waterboy. \n\nTL;DR: Bought tickets to Waterboy, saw Brad Pitt, watched Waterboy.

Basically if it was made in the 90's it would be right there with Wedding Singer or Big Daddy in the movies Sandler made that Sandler fans like and most audiences can watch but some people will be like \"Eh not really my tempo\" but since it's recent it has more flak than is necessary. Though I'd say people are more forgiving to it than That's My Boy\n\nAlso Reign Over Me is just a great movie that would have done probably 10x better if it didn't have Sandler in it (who acted well beyond fine just his name carries Billy Madison voice so most people have bias)",

Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and The Waterboy are all really good, funny movies. The Wedding Singer was decent enough and Big Daddy was reasonably hilarious. I didn't like Click just because the life lesson it supposedly tried to give was muddied by the fact that **if that fucking remote control just followed instructions and didn't interpret things like a complete and total idiot he would have been fine**, but I can see why people wouldn't mind that movie either.\n\n50 First Dates was great, Mr. Deeds was OK, Reign Over Me was a step away from his usual style but still a nice enough flick, and The Longest Yard was fine too. \n\nCome to think of it Sandler has made a lot of really good movies. It's weird that he's known as the guy with the worst of the worst shit. Murray was in Garfield and people don't say all of his stuff sucks.",

The conflict exists because Adam Sandler fast forwards through his life already, doing nothing but picking work over family. The remote merely makes that autopilot go faster. And because it keeps skipping his life, Sandler doesn't get to have the best of both worlds so he gets to see the worst of the world he chose, divorce, child estrangement, his dad dying while walking away crying, and ultimately his own death from poor health choices.\n\nOh well though I guess that's not everyone's cup of tea.",

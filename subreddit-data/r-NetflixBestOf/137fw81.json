            "comment": "Took it: \"Reality shows are shows that follow a celebrity/public figure/influencer in their daily lives.\" Maybe I am out of touch with modern TV but my understanding is that this is a much more limited definition of Reality TV than is accurate (at least by US standards) and omits many shows I'd usually consider Reality TV that do not feature established celebrities such as Survivor, Big Brother, Naked and Afraid, lots of other examples... \n\nWas the definition you posted in the survey taken from an academic source or just defined for the purpose of this survey? My thought is you might have better success and access a more useful demographic for the study by using a different term/definition than \"Reality show\" (personally I have no interest/experience in shows centered around celeb lives and probably would have skipped the survey had I known this, I don't have anything useful to contribute.  I'm sure the opposite is also true, people will see \"Reality show\" and skip the survey when in actuality they do enjoy celeb shows and would have useful responses)",

This is done for the purpose of the study  and at the end of the day, it is a type of reality shows. So maybe we can formulate it a bit better so that it\u2019s clear. \nThank you so much for your participation and constructive feedback and if you know anyone who is interested in this type of reality shows please send it to them\ud83d\ude4f\nI need all the help I could get\ud83d\ude4c",

I felt like the other poster that felt your definition of \" reality tv show \" was not correct because not all reality tv shows have famous people in it. If I were you I'd fix this before handing in your work like changing it too \" for the purpose of this survey a reality tv show is defined as...or whatever. Otherwise you are handing in incorrect work and your whole questionnaire is flawed. Anyway good luck with your work , I hope you get lots of responses",

    "postText": "Exactly what the title says, I want a show that is episodic so I can pick it up and drop it anytime I want and is a relaxing/calm show. I do NOT want it to be something serious like Criminal. I do not mind if it's animated or not or what the target audience of the show is.\n\nSome examples would be :- Midnight diner, Bottakuri (Purely coincidence that both are food related shows)\n\nSomething that is also like this that I enjoyed but isn't on netflix is the animated show 'Bluey'\n\nIt doesn't have to be on netflix but it would preferable.\n\nThanks a lot! :D",

I don't think Joe Pera is in World of Calm (though I'm delighted so many of you are enjoying it!), I think I was thinking of how his show premiered on Adult Swim's catch-all title \"Infomercials\". His special I was thinking of is available free online, [Relaxing Old Footage with Joe Pera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv-P2aN3-b4), and is just soothing beyond all belief.*",

I know it's not what you're looking for per your title as it's a long drama, but it mainly focuses on food and medicine and most of the \"conflict\" gets solved within the episodes.\n\nChef Hua (chinese) is much shorter, and it's more feel good. Almost no conflict. They're both period dramas\n\n\n\nReply 1988 is my most rewatched. Makes me feel homesick for childhood in the best way. It's on netflix",

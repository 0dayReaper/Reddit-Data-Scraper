It doesn't have to be on Netflix .\n\nMy favorite shows are BB , BCS , Prison Break , Lost , Dexter , GOT and etc. Now I got bored during those shows as well but very rarely.\n\nAlso what does everyone think about \"Succession\" . Should I give it a try?",

It\u2019s painfully underrated. \n\nSo I actually read the trilogy before I even knew it was being made into a series. And keeping in mind it is *Stephen King* (I have 131 of his books if that tell you anything about me lol), and in all honesty \u201cMr. Mercedes\u201d is my favourite of his books, so I knew I\u2019d be picky and probably think it sucks\u2026 Wrong! So wrong. \n\nThe casting is impeccable (Holly is exactly how I pictured her when I read the trilogy, it\u2019s wild). The way you get tricked into having empathy for the wrong people. Being convinced you know how X will unravel only to have everything get flipped on its head. \n\nI don\u2019t want to write a whole novel in a comment but if you want more specifics or have questions about the series, hit me up!

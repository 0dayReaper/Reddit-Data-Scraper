Darkly hilarious. Beautiful then grotesque. Laugh out loud dialogue then gut wrenching drama. Brenden and Colin murder their roles with some of the best on screen chemistry I've ever seen. \n\nRalph Feines shows up and pushes it all over the top with my favorite performance of his ever. \n",

If the title sounds familiar, it's definitely a fan favorite around Reddit so I figured I got to repost this suggestion so more people can get it before it goes!\n\nVery quotable film, once you watch it you'll be able to pick up whenever someone references it on Reddit (which is surprisingly often!)\n\nIt's a real modern-day tragedy by all classical definitions of the term if I've ever seen one and definitely recommend it.

Well, that older chap seems to be OK, the younger one is...\n\nSpoilers: The scene that makes this movie for me is when the older hitman is reluctantly about to kill Colin, but stops because the target is about to off himself.\n\nIt gives a completely new take on a tired film trope. That is kinda Tarantino's whole thing. But In Bruges does it really well. Also, The Matador.",

Hopefully none of us has anything on our conscious as bad as killing a child, but everyone can relate to the feeling of helplessness that consumes Ray as he realizes that no matter what, that will always have happened.  \"That ain't ever going away.  Not ever.  Unless, maybe, I go away\".  \n\nKen's struggle with his \"debt\" to Harry and his paternal feelings towards Ray are another strong point.  \n\nI highly recommend getting the DVD so you can watch the deleted scenes.  There is a great one with the Harry/Ken backstory.  When you see it you will know why it was cut, but its hilarious.  Also some good small scenes that I wish they could have included (How do little bridges go?\"\n\nAlso, the scene where Harry tells Ken what he needs to do is all one take.  Makes it so much more powerful.  ",

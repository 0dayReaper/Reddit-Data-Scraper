But consider:\n\n&gt;**Angier:** You never understood why we did this. The audience knows the truth: the world is simple. It's miserable, solid all the way through. But if you could fool them, even for a second, then you can make them wonder, and then you... then you got to see something really special. You really don't know? It was... it was the look on their faces...\n\nits for me the core and most poignant statement of the movie, I read it as the Nolans speaking more or less directly to the audience of what they think they are doing, of what film (TV, stage magic, books) can do. And I think they might also have done it to drive the point home that this story is made up, that we know the world to be *solid all the way through* but what matters is that we enjoy the movie while watching.\n\nLook at *Looper*, on all accounts a well made and entertaining movie but if you think in any way about the time travel mechanics it falls apart. Does it matter? A bit but not really if it doesn't stop you from enjoying the movie while you are watching it.",

The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called \"The Turn\". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call \"The Prestige\".\"",

But....!\n\n(2) After Angiers' final act debuts, we see Borden give up, and tell Fallon to let it go and to let the man have his trick. When Borden is finally dragged away to be hanged, *Borden* says to *Fallon*, \"I know you told me to stay away and leave him with his trick. I'm sorry.\"\n\n(3) Same scene as before--Borden being taken away to be hanged while Fallon stands at the gate to his cell watching--Borden tells Fallon something like \"I'm sorry for Sarah,\" which you assume in the moment is simply a dying man's general confession of remorse to anyone who will listen, but which, in hindsight, is actually a much more literal apology. I only noticed this one after watching through specifically to see if you could tell who is who in any given scene (you almost always can).",

As we go back in time when the diaries were written, both magicians become obsessed with their rival's best trick. The tricks, as shown to the audience, look the same, but neither magician can figure out how his opponent does it.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n&gt; The Prestige received largely positive reviews from film critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 75% of critics gave the film positive reviews, with an average score of 7\\.1\\/10, based upon a sample of 190 reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 66, based on 36 reviews. Claudia Puig of USA Today described the film as \"one of the most innovative, twisting, turning art films of the past decade.\" Drew McWeeny gave the film a glowing review, saying it demands repeat viewing, with Peter Travers of Rolling Stone agreeing. Richard Roeper and guest critic A.O. Scott gave the film a \"two thumbs up\" rating. Todd Gilchrist of IGN applauded the performances of Jackman and Bale whilst praising Nolan for making \"this complex story as easily understandable and effective as he made the outwardly straightforward comic book adaptation (Batman Begins) dense and sophisticated... any truly great performance is almost as much showmanship as it is actual talent, and Nolan possesses both in spades.\" CNN.com and Village Voice film critic Tom Charity listed it amongst his best films of 2006\\. Philip French of The Observer recommended the film, comparing the rivalry between the two main characters to that of Mozart and Salieri in the highly acclaimed Amadeus.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?The+Prestige+%282006%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The%20Prestige%20%28film%29), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/prestige/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-prestige), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70047095), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q46551).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F7p8s2b \"Confidence: 1.07\").

He is a master of his craft, and every one of his films is worthy of praise and some criticism, but this film is perhaps one of the closest examples of what a human can describe as a perfect film. \n\nThe writing, directing, and cast and performances are phenomenal, but what makes this film truly perfect is its use of audio and visuals to not only captivate you, interest you, and make you curious of the world you\u2019re seeing but it also makes you believe the world and what you\u2019re seeing is real, and that\u2019s its prestige: you not only believe what you\u2019re seeing, you believe it so much that it tricks you, plays with your mind and emotions, and suspends your disbelief when in fact you should be skeptical of everything you\u2019re hearing and being shown. Not every film, or really any film, can do this with such precision. \n\nThat\u2019s why this film holds up so well to multiple viewings: most directors and writers set out to make one film, and sometimes barely accomplish that feat, but with The Prestige, what is it that Nolan set out to do, and what did he end up with? Is The Prestige one film or trick, or is it many? Is it infinite? \n\n\n",

None. Nothing is a surprise. There are a total of zero plot twists in this movie. But everyone thinks there are. \n\n*The whole fucking thing is a magic trick. An illusion.*\n\nThe first line of dialogue is the magician's question, which immediately misdirects the audience: \"Are you watching closely?\"\n\nYou're then misdirected through the whole film. Every single thing is laid out for the viewer; the viewer is shown every single piece of the puzzle, nothing is left out. But the viewer doesn't see it. The movie goes meta again, and explains it: *You want to be fooled.*\n\nYou're shown everything. But you don't want to see it. You want to be fooled.\n\nThis movie about magic tricks is a magic trick played on its audience. An illusion, misdirection. And it is stunning in its beauty. \n\nI first read here on reddit a year or so ago that every scene is a lesson on foreshadowing. I teach high school English, and foreshadowing is something I teach, so I paid attention. I watched it several times over. I showed it to my classes. Last December alone I watched it five times over the course of a week.\n\nIt is brilliant. It hides nothing. You are shown everything; the question is, do you want to see it?\n\nNo. You want to be fooled.\n\nI'd love to explain everything I've caught in my multiple viewings, plus what my students have noticed. But I may run out of space, and it's late. A couple:\n\n* Angier's wife dies by drowning in a magician's tank. Angier tries to replicate that by holding his head under water until he cannot take it any longer and surfaces, weeping. He later succeeds; he kills himself by drowning in a magician's tank again and again and again and again and again.\n\n* Borden's wife dies by hanging. Fallon then dies by hanging.\n\n* Angier fumbles killing Borden by shooting him. Borden then kills Angier by shooting him. Borden foreshadows this by explaining how dangerous the bullet catch is to his wife.\n\n* It seems impossible to Angier that Borden doesn't know which which knot he tied. Between Borden and Fallon, Borden truthfully doesn't know.\n\n* Sarah realizes there are two of them; sometimes he loves her, sometimes he does not. She figures out it's because there are two, and it destroys her. She screams during a fight with Fallon, *\"I know what you are!\"* She means that completely; she understands fully. She hangs herself.\n\n* Fallon tells Olivia part of him (Borden) loved Sarah, but the part that is in front of Olivia right now (Fallon) loves her. She says he could be anywhere else right now and talking about her as he is about Sarah. She is being completely literal and is completely correct.\n\n* \"They are all your hat, Mr. Angier.\"\n\nIt's late and I could keep going, but I should stop. This is one of the best films ever made. I need to read the book.",

My first inclination of the replictor machine were the endless possibilities with it...but nope, Wolverine wants to make clones to do a trick to outdo Batman. All to reveal in the end that Batman has a Bat twin he's been using that Wolverine couldn't figure out.\n\nYes, I understand that Wolverine was so consumed with jealousy he didn't care about the other possibilities of the replicator...it just seems pretty underwhelming as a story.\n\nIdk, any input would be appreciated.

After all was said and done, it didn't really matter who was a child rapist and who was exacting revenge, they were both sick and horrible people going to lengths they had no business going to. I think it's a piece on that sick kind of aggression, and how society sometimes winds up legitimizing its usage against people we deem generally undesirable as a form of outlet for anger and the desire for violence. \n\nSeeing this kind of 'justice' play out confuses the viewer, who by the end of the film fails to fully empathize with either side of the equation, the child rapist for their crimes, and the vigilante for the dehumanizing treatment she dishes out. Because while it's certainly easy to say certain people deserve the worst, it's hard to actually watch it unfold, and when the lines between justice and unfiltered, sadistic cruelty blur as much as they do with Ellen's character, it becomes especially hard to really root for anyone. You just want the unnecessary abuse to end out of pure principle.",

I'll need to watch it again cause I don't remember her age every being discussed prior to their meeting or even until after she drugged him. If it was then honestly i'd have to say that ruins the whole movie cause there is not much room for doubt then. ",

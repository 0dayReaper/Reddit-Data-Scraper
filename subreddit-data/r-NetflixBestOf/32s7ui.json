Unless my memory is missing, the movie did not portray a *gun* causing someone's head to blow up, but that scene where the pointy concrete thing was pushed off the roof of the church and fell on Tim Messenger's head, it exploded.\n\nSo a head did explode but not due to a gun.",

Visual gags and physical comedy are  essential in a comedy movie, and knowing how to balance the two seperates the great comedies.  Hot Fuzz takes it another level with the humourous editing and camera movement, yet somehow it does this without breaking the 4th wall or making it distracting.  And and there's off-screen audio gags.  This movie has everything.  ",

It's probably the weakest of the three, but we're talking about a *very strong field* here.  It's still a damn good movie.",

Too good. And to stop the rest of his team looking bad, he is reassigned to the quiet town of Sandford. He is paired with Danny Butterman, who endlessly questions him on the action lifestyle. Everything seems quiet for Angel, until two actors are found decapitated. It is called an accident, but Angel isn't going to accept that, especially when more and more people turn up dead. Angel and Danny clash with everyone, whilst trying to uncover the truth behind the mystery of the apparent \"accidents\".\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n&gt; The film received critical acclaim, and was rated as highly as Shaun of the Dead. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 91% approval rating with an average rating of 7\\.7\\/10 based on 198 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"The brilliant minds behind Shaun of the Dead successfully take a shot at the buddy cop genre with Hot Fuzz. The result is a bitingly satiric and hugely entertaining parody.\" It also has a Metacritic score of 81\\/100\\. Olly Richards of Empire said of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost\\: \"After almost a decade together they\u2019re clearly so comfortable in each other\u2019s presence that they feel no need to fight for the punchline, making them terrific company for two hours\". Johnny Vaughan of The Sun already called it the \"most arresting Brit-com of 2007\". Phillip French of The Observer, who did not care for Shaun of the Dead, warmed to the comedy team in this film. The film also received positive reviews stateside. Derek Elley of Variety praised Broadbent and Dalton as \"especially good as Angel's hail-fellow-well-met superior and oily No. 1 suspect\". As an homage to the genre, the film was well received by screenwriter Shane Black. On Spill.com, it got their 2nd-highest rating of 'Full Price\\!\\!'.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\n**Awards:** 1 nominations\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Hot+Fuzz+%282007%29), [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com\\/en\\/hot\\_fuzz), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3006708), [Rotten Tomatoes](//www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hot_fuzz/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hot-fuzz), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70056431).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F32s7ui \"Confidence: 1.09\").

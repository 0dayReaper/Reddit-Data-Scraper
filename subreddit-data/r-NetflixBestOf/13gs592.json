The Lucifer from the comic is melancholic, he has seen it all since forever, he\u2019s tired and wary, but at some point he smiles recognizes God makes beautiful sunsets. The Lucifer from the series is an an immature brat.Not that he\u2019s an unlikable character, he is just different from Gaima\u0144s. H\u00e9s a lot more fun and has black hair, a beard and a fashion sense. Gaiman\u2019s is blonde and clean shaven.\n\nAs for the show, it\u2019s like a 6.7. The Lucifer actor is good, so is the character. The cop/partner/romantic interest is a disaster, the character is plain and annoying, the actress has no charisma and can\u2019t act at all. The stories are fun because they are irreverent. I like it when Lucifer plays the Piano and sings at the show, same thing, fun and irreverent, but not a bad musician. All in all, mostly forgettable, but you can do worse.",

Never seen anything like it. You never know what is coming next and be assured it will entertain you. Many of the characters are now part of news streaming movies.  Google rates the series at 95%.  The actor that plays Lucifer is extraordinary.  He can sing and does so throughout the series. It is a hilarious parody on heaven and hell.",

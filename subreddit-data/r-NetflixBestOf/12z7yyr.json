The last scene was his devil smile, the forced one which he does when he wants to hide his pain. \n\nAlso in the hypnosis, he says that the devil will walk away from you and when he wakes up he is far from the chair he started in. So it was the devil version of himself and he remembered everything.\n\nJust my take.",

            "comment": "I'm about 20 minutes in and have paused it to fact check. I don't like watching documentaries with inaccuracies because I'm worried I'll remember incorrect information.\n\nFirst, the quote about Cleopatra being black is weird, especially given how it blew up. It's a classics scholar telling an anecdote of how she started learning classics in elementary school. The woman is probably in her 60s. She then says her grandmother told her &lt;insert quote&gt;. But then we're given a beat to pause and the scene changes back to the reenactment. So she's not saying it as a professional statement, but the editing makes it suggest it's true.\n\nSecond, we're then shown Ptolemy 12 on his deathbed and we're told Cleopatra's older sister tried to usurp his throne. Except that's not what happened. I remembered this vaguely from my Egyptology course in uni, so I paused to do some searches and refresh my info.\n\n He increased taxes to pay for bribes to Rome (to avoid Egypt being annexed) and there were multiple strikes and revolts *by farmers* until courtiers made him step down and appointed his eldest daughter Bernice as queen. He then fled to Rome. Romans didn't like this because Ptolemy had a lot of debt they wanted repaid so they killed Bernice's protest envoy (sent to say \"please don't invade Egypt to restore him to power\") and Ptolemy hired a general to invade Egypt to restore himself to power.\n\nI get simplifying things but that part of her history is really important because  Egypt's relationship with Rome is an incredibly important context for understanding her reign. Even more relevant, Ptolemy took Cleopatra with him into exile and on the campaign to recover Egypt is ***where she met Mark Anthony and is where he says he fell in love with her***. She was 14, so now I'm wondering if this handwave treatment of her father's dethroning is groundwork to gloss over that age discrepancy? I stopped watching, but now I'm curious how they portray the MA/Cleo relationship.\n\nSo, I'm already kinda skeptical of how true details in this series are. I think I'll wait for the inevitable /r/AskHistorians thread, I can look over that before I finish watching so I don't learn inaccuracies. Netflix's other docudramas have had similar issues portraying history correctly, favoring style and drama over facts (the Rome series was basically fiction, the Ottoman series devolved into mostly just fight scenes, the Romanovs got this overly-sympathetic, romantic portrayal...).",

Cleopatra sought to make many alliances to recuperate her throne but all were interfered by Ptolemy. Eventually the rumor came that Cleopatra was forming and Alliance with the Roman Empire, which is why Ptolemy sent to kill Pompey to win Ceasar's favor. Ceasar was angered by the murder of a Roman which is why he took Cleopatra's side, also because Ptolemy tried to kill him. Marc Antony was a companion to Ceasar. He is said to have been obsessed with cleopatra since they met. But romans did not acknowledge the children of Cleopatra and Ceasar as true romans because of their Egyptian mother, hence they could not rule. The only that recognized their legitimacy was Marc Antony.",

This isn't like changing a fictionalized character like James Bond or The Little Mermaid, she was a real person and most certainly not black.\n\nI'm all for inclusion, and you could make every fictional film have a black, brown, or native lead for all I care, but this feels like shitty revisionist history.\n\nThe lawsuit itself is stupid as well, but for an entirely different reason. From what I've read, it's really just an Islamic fundamentalist complaining that Netflix content generally, and Cleopatra specifically doesn't conform with Islamic teachings.",

That much is fact.  \nEgypt lies in North Africa, you got Amazigh tribes, such as moroccans, libyans, etc... who are technically africans, but vastly different from central africans.  \n  \nNow within egypt itself, you got people from the north near the Mediterranean who resemble more like Mediterranean people. Shocking!   \n  \nThen you got people from the south, such as Aswan and Luxor, who are way darker than those living in the north, but much much lighter than those from central/western/eastern africa (aka. Jada's ancestors)  \n  \nput on top of that the Nubians who are dark more than anything, but still different than central africans. Facial features wise.  \n  \nWhen you look at Tut Ankh Amun artifacts, you'll find his stick, slippers and tools. They're in the museum and photos are available online. You'll find that he put drawings of his enemies at the bottom of his stick, one is asian with a beard resembling the Assyrians and the other is a dark skinned man with curly short hair, representing the Ethiopian invaders who tried to attack from the south.  \n  \nAfro centrics talk about Egypt as being called historically \"Kemet\" meaning the black land... Where in fact it was called Kemet because it was all concentrated on both sides of the Nile which was a rich black mud land. That was the highlight of egypt in the first place. The rich black mud that helped grow rice and grain which started the relationship with Rome to feed their armies.  \n\nSo when Jada started to talk about a dark black African queen as being Egyptian, you can see why we're upset, then when we discover it's actually not even an Egyptian but a greek macedonian queen, then who is she trying to fool and what is she and netflix are trying to say calling a documentary?",

Even so, it's clear that in this case there's a deliberate attempt to cast all of the egyptians as black American and British people while all of the romans are cast as the palest white British people as a proxy for modern US and UK racial systems centered around the dichotomy of modern concepts of whiteness and blackness. The result is a complete distortion that lends itself to popular fringe theories about modern Egyptians in particular being 'invaders'. It would be one thing if they cast just Cleopatra this way (after all, while highly unlikely, it's not outside of the realm of possibility that she had an ancestor who would today be viewed as 'black'). But every casting decision was made appropriatively, while labeling the whole project a 'documentary'.\n\nEgypt was always diverse, but since the old kindgom egyptians have, on average, looked like modern egyptians, and while Egypt has been invaded many times. This has been irrefutably proved by DNA studies as well as Old Kingdom artwork and descriptions by Greeks and Romans.",

The result is a complete distortion that lends itself to popular fringe theories about modern Egyptians in particular being 'invaders'. It would be one thing if they cast just Cleopatra this way (after all, while highly unlikely, it's not outside of the realm of possibility that she had an ancestor who would today be viewed as 'black'). But every casting decision was made appropriatively, while labeling the whole project a 'documentary'.",

His whiteness wasn't a critical fact of his life outside of the generally racist societal norms he lived under.\n\nThe fact that Cleopatra was a Greek ruler in Egypt is extremely important to her history and the history of the entire dynasty of which she was a part.",

It's super up to interpretation, but to me it plays into the theme of an immigrant rising up to power and fighting for freedom. \n\nThe one act of casting black actors raises all kinds of questions and comparisons in the audiences mind. Like, why would have all these characters been white? What could we have achieved if we'd allowed people of color the same freedom we allowed Hamilton? What does this have in common with current and historical fights for rights? And it lets PoC audiences see themselves in the story to inspire them instead of just glorifying dead white men as these stories usually do. \n\nWhether you feel a connection to any of that or not, it's a deliberate artistic choice that serves a purpose. It's not trying to rewrite history.\n\nEdit: I realized I didn't say that I'm talking about Hamilton here, not Cleopatra. Which does seem like it's trying to rewrite history.",

It may seem harmless to pick a black actress to play Cleopatra but people need to realize that there are actual black people (African Americans in particular) who believe that Egyptians were black and that modern Egyptians are imposters. So this documentary does nothing but add fuel to the fire and tries to legitimize this conspiracy theory and animosity towards Egyptians.",

This was the focus of the trailer even though it's apparently not the focus of the series. Scholars who have viewed the docudrama in advance have noted that the expert opinions on the show are fairly well balanced, with the main weaknesses being the kind of overdramatized scripted elements that add the \"drama\" to the doc. Reading these reviews, I'm given the impression that it's similar to the combination of research and schlock that characterizes Netflix docudramas like Roman Empire. Since that wouldn't have made headlines or generated hatewatching, Netflix turned to misleading marketing and outrage bait.\"\n\n\nSo it seems like they specifically wanted to generate controversy to hype the show, hoping that maybe they'd get a lot of support since the media tends to skew \"pro-black\" on anything, but instead it's just generated a lot of hate.",

Stick to your own damn history and stop inserting yourselves into every single story. The idea that a black woman ruled Egypt in a very colorist ancient society that enslaved black people and systematically and very intentionally bred them out of their culture is hysterical. And Cleopatra's family (like others in power) was very incestuous and kept it in the family. Not to mention the fact that we have numerous images of Cleopatra in artifacts and none of them depict her as black or having African features. I'm just so sick of this stupid nonsense.

Asserting that what we've been taught in school is a lie, that Cleopatra was actually a dark skinned African woman all along.

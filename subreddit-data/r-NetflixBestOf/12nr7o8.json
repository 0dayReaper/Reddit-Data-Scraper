All critically acclaimed films.\n\nHell, he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for *Minari*...\n\nDudes crushing it. (And rightfully so, he's a fantastic actor).",

I know that church is not a very popular thing on Reddit, and I'm not religious myself, but I've been to church many times (long story) and I've seen people who thought their life was over go to church and have that kind of spiritual moment. The churches I went to were for homeless drug addicts getting a second chance at life, so these moments were the genuine kind, the kind you want to see. When you see some rich person crying at church it doesn't have the same effect. Man, I wish modern Christians remembered that Jesus wanted the lowest of people to find peace and love.",

Some people will take the light hearted approach but I found it incredibly thought-provoking and profound, more than anything I've watched of late that's for sure.\n\nI've read a lot of takes but one thing I haven't seen mentioned is that I think &gt;!episode 10 was a nod to psychedelics and self-disclosure being the true therapy that these two needed. Also that the 'everything fades' line includes their resentment towards each other!&lt;\n\nI connected with these characters much more than I expected to. Maybe I'm just one of the broken ones too",

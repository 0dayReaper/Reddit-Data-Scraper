If our unemployment is at 5%, then we have ~7.2 million unemployed people. If our unemployment goes up to 6%, we have ~8.7 million unemployed people.\n\nOut of the newly unemployed, some will have savings, backup plans, or be able to make money in other ways. But not all. Some will not have money saved, not have alternative means of income, etc. If it were to stay at that rate for long enough, these people will likely lose their homes as well. Then, they'll likely become dependent on government programs, friends and family, charities, etc. \n\n40000 would be equal to 2.6 percent of the newly unemployed 1.5 million. I doubt the stat is accurate, but it wouldn't be too difficult to imagine the absolute bottom 2.6% of the new unemployed, the worst off of the bunch, ending up dead. Also worth remembering that they have dependents, so more people are affected than just the job holder.\n\nNot trying to justify the stat, of course, but a percent of unemployment is a lot of people, and 40 thousand isn't very many by comparison.\n\nEDIT: And I totally forgot the increases in crime that is likely to follow higher unemployment, which would contribute to a few deaths, I'm sure.",

Or...you remain married and your wife constantly tries to spend more than you have, even if it's only a dollar.\n\nYour savings are quickly depleted (if you even ever had any savings), because you thought it was a temporary patch, but...it never really got better (at least not better for you).\n\nYou think of how to kill yourself in a way that will benefit your family, but...after you can't find a viable angle, you just try to think of a way to end your misery without it looking like a suicide.",

Most people not in finance have never had any dealings with a ratings agency and really don't know their function or value.  It's just \"part of the system\" which in their minds is run by the groups they are familiar with, the banks.  \nI look at it like banks are the front men of the financial machine and ratings agencies are cogs.

Luckily in the wake of that crisis many states, and even the federal government, passed laws to protect renters in those situations. If you live in Florida, if a house you are renting is foreclosed on, the bank can not begin eviction process until your lease is up, or if you have a month to month lease or no lease at all, you get 30 or 90 days to vacate (can't remember which). I also think an exception applies if the new owners intend to live in the home, they can begin process earlier. ",

They could have easily made this movie like Spotlight and did dramatic camera angles and dramatic faces and dramatic music, but no. They entertained us throughout. Kept the storyline moving, even through a topic that could be as dry as sand.

It's essentially a bet against a stock or bond. In this case, all the main characters were betting that U.S. housing bonds would default, i.e. massive numbers of homeowners would stop paying their bills. That is such an unlikely and unprecedented occurrence that they were able to negotiate a colossal return on that \"bet,\" which is why they all had dollar signs popping out of their eyes through the whole film.\n\n**ARMs, or adjustable rate mortgages:** An absolutely disgusting bait and switch tactic used to rope poor people into mortgages they can't afford. The creditor hands out a large loan which is fixed at a low rate for a limited time. After that period of time, the monthly bill on the mortgage changes based on, I don't know, the price of rice in China. In all cases it goes up substantially.\n\nThose two Florida douches were selling these in the film. The pitch is, \"Hey, I can put you in your own home for less than you're paying in rent right now. Don't worry about the rate going up, that's years down the road, besides, you'll have plenty of money by then! Look at what you're going to save!\"\n\n**NINJAs, or no income, no job, or assets:** The catchy acronym which refers to the poor mooks who got sold these shitty mortgages.\n\n**CDOs, or collateralized debt obligations:** An absolutely disgusting bait and switch tactic used to rope wealthy people into investments that will never pay a return. The depositor creates a financial instrument where shitty ARMs (which were sold to literal homeless people in some cases) get packaged together along with the mortgage on Bill Gates' fifth summer home and divided up into little slices. It's sort of like eating at Barth's, if you know there's a dead body somewhere in the building, [it's safe to assume it's going to end up in the burgers.](http://i.imgur.com/EHMOLgI.jpg)\n\n[Here's a helpful diagram of how to make a shit sandwich in your own kitchen at home.](http://i.imgur.com/qtGfmiy.jpg)\n\nYou create a normal sandwich of your choice, then you place it on top of a cow pie. The money gets poured on top. Once the top part fills up, it spills over onto the next slice. Everyone who had a slice on top gets to keep the money. The people on the lower slices get to keep a little bit more. When the money runs out, the one at the bottom doesn't get a drop, even though they got the slice of cowshit. Here's the best part though: if that happens enough times, everyone has to take a bite of the sandwich and find out just how good that shit at the bottom tastes.\n\nBy \"everyone,\" that means anyone with a stock portfolio, anyone with a pension, and pretty much anyone whose life is even remotely affected by the status of a mutual fund. Nearly everybody bought into the shit sandwich. Even the people who have never owned a mortgage in their lives got a taste. U.S. housing bonds were considered the safest of safe bets besides actual Treasury bonds. That is, until the guys portrayed in this movie came along, and all they really did was take advantage of a blind spot that pretty much everyone else had.",

The plan is to rebuild within 5-7 years, at which point we would need to obtain new financing anyway.  The cost of the house was well below what we could afford, such that if interest rates go up a huge amount and we decide not to rebuild for some reason, we could easily afford to refinance into a higher rate loan.  In the meantime, paying a much cheaper note means that I am able to create significant additional savings, which go towards either building the home we actually want (on this lot), or paying down the principal should we decide to refi.\n\nThe two keys to an ARM being appropriate are: 1) the time period of the fixed portion of the loan is in-line with proper planning, and 2) you use the ARM to lower your monthly obligation (e.g.- keep liquidity), rather than to \"afford more house\" (e.g.- over-extend yourself should things go wrong).",

I knew I wasn't going to be in the house that long.\n\nThe take away is the an ARM isn't necessarily a bad thing if used in appropriate situations.  The problem was that it was being used in an entirely inappropriate way to get people to buy houses that they have no business being in so that mortgage makers could make huge money on their commissions up front.",

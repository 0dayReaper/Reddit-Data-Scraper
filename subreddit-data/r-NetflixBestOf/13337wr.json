The first comment was a joke alluding to just how well known Hitchcock is. It depended on the readers: a) knowing that this is one of Hitchcock\u2019s most famous films b) knowing this is common knowledge (at least among English speaking Reddit readership) and c) picking up that the commenter was being sarcastic\n\nI guess you maybe missed b or c to not get the joke, but the people mocking you for that are ablist sh*ts who need to take a good look at their own mean spirited attitude of self importance. There are many reasons people may not pick up on sarcasm other than being thick.",

You can see the bones for hundreds of monster movies in the story/framing/staging. Some real groundbreaking stuff.\n\nThe subtext of the movie though, wild! The term bird: slang for young woman at the time. So, everytime this strong, independent young woman takes the initiative; in her developing relationship, disrupting the traditional school/teacher dynamic, even letting the man rest and investigating a bit, she is BRUTALLY punished. I've never seen a movie that was so violent in pushing a woman back into the proverbial kitchen. I knew Hitchcock had his strong views on male/female roles, they're there in a lot of his work. I had never seen The Birds though. Strong statement against the politics of his time that has not aged nearly as well as his virtuosic technical skill.",

Respect.\n\nWatching The Birds: I naturally wanted to view it like you did. A strong independent woman struggling against the \"natural\" established order and triumphing in the end. &gt;!Except she doesn't triumph. She's catatonic for the last few scenes, and the birds only relent and let her pass by when she's totally broken and reliant on a man for support, within a traditional family structure. Over and over, the birds attack when she's trying to take control of a situation. At the school, they relent when she gets into a car and takes on a nurturing, motherly role for the children. In the cafe, the mother point blank accuses her of bringing the birds' wrath onto their town, she is concerned for her children!&lt; \n\nHitchcock was not a progressive, liberal dude. I think it would be wrong to apply our 21st century politics to his narratives, because we want his movies to be relevant to us today. I can appreciate his artistry and importance to film without making a value judgement on his point of view, it was just striking how different it was than anything that would be made in studio cinema today.",

It was in Capitola, which is next to Santa Cruz.\n\n\"The Birds film was partly inspired by the true events of a mass bird attack on the seaside town of Capitola in California on August 18, 1961, when \"Capitola residents awoke to a scene that seemed straight out of a horror movie. Hordes of seabirds were dive-bombing their homes, crashing into cars and spewing half-digested anchovies onto lawns\".\\[6\\] Alfred Hitchcock heard of this event and used it as research material for this film which was then in progress. The real cause of the birds' behavior was toxic algae, but that was not known back in the 1960s.\\[7\\]\"",

He's regarded as making the first British talkie. He had an immeasurable impact on public perception of psychological concepts and conflicts. He synthesized German Expressionism and Socialist Realism, and used the resultant language to give form and visual coherence to emergent terms- creating a new lexicon that allowed the people of the twentieth century to understand and communicate about these human impulses in a deeper way.",

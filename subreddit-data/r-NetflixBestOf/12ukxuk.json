Her character was previously doing in the trenches work in the MidEast. The implication deployed being that dresses were seldom seen or worn, showers were available a lot less than daily, and nuances of pomp and circumstance were not a high priority.  It would improve her character's presentation significantly if she just tied her hair back when meeting with high ranking folks though imo.",

Unfortunately, it took me until the middle of the third episode to accept that, along with the assumption that because she has a background of working in the field her character  will naturally curse like a sailor.\n\nI get that her character has been unexpectedly thrown into a unknown scenario and she doesn't fully understand why. In addition there's the negative feelings she harbors for her husband.  There is internal tension.\n\nThis is my point of view. Early on it's implied that her character is a highly skilled person who gets results in the field.  That someone with that type of intelligence wouldn't be able to quickly adjust to another environment seemed implausible. I keep thinking \"What's wrong with her?\" and \"Why is the storyline lingering so long on her transition to the diplomatic world?\"\n\nNevertheless, I appreciate your comment. Maybe I will gather up enough fortitude to watch episode four.",

Especially if it gives you insight into how some things work in the world in general. Of course there's a lot of dramatization, as I'd imagine that most diplomat have a quieter life than this, but it's still fun and instructive.\n\nKerri Russell is one of my favorite actreses since The Americans so it's good to see how in a strong role like this, but I'm not so sure about how her character is written. I get that she's used to be on the ground in conflict areas, and not so much to attending galas and what not, but they're making a bit too much of a big deal that she doesn't like dresses, doesn't wear heels etc. Once or twice ok, but it's constant. It's a bit unnecessary, like they're trying to prove she's professional by making her look like \"one of the guys\" when we can already see very well how professional she is, regardless of how she feels about couture. Bit of a tired trope to rely on for character writing tbh.",

            "comment": "I can't even begin to describe how absurd this series is and, to do so, I am afraid I will have to include spoilers. So, if you haven't seen the series yet, I suggest you don't read this review.\n\n&gt;!For starters, there is an overt partisan political bias in the series. Brexit is described as the greatest \"self-inflicted wound\" in history; \"Global Britain\" is ridiculed; Scotland and Northern Ireland are presented as being in the imminence of breaking up from the United Kingdom; and Tory politicians are generally implied to be sleazy. The series also reinforces the themes of British \"decline\" and similar anti-British stereotypes that have become prevalent in the United States recently.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Second, the plot is often nonsensical. Why would a by-election defeat in Scotland force the UK Prime Minister to agree to a second Scottish independence referendum? Also, the American characters keep calling the Prime Minister the \"Head of State\" when he is just the head of government in the UK and the Head of State is obviously HM The King. The creator of the series apparently knows little about British politics and the UK constitution while believing to be an expert on the topic. And I would not even get into the absurdity that a British Prime Minister would hire  Russian mercenaries to torpedo the Royal Navy's flagship (and indeed one of only 2 aircraft carriers in service in the Royal Navy today), and expect that he could not only get away with it, but also that engineering a conflict with Iran would help him in a hypothetical Scottish independence referendum. Unless there is some plot twist in Season 2, the concept is so preposterous and nonsensical that it doesn't even merit discussion. Not to mention also that, from a military point of view, aircraft carriers are escorted by battle group ships and submarines, which should be able to detect and intercept a speedboat before it could strike the carrier.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The worst part, however, is just the behavior of the lead characters. The US ambassador to the Court of St. James talks with His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs repeatedly using the F-word and other forms of profanity. She also seems to drop in on the Foreign Secretary whenever she wants. The CIA Station Chief in London implies that she wants to recruit the UK Foreign Secretary as an asset and the Foreign Secretary schedules a secret meeting with the Iranian ambassador arranged by the CIA and without going over this matter with the Prime Minister, the Civil Service, and/or the Cabinet. The President of the United States, clearly modeled after Joe Biden, is depicted as senile and in need of babysitting by the White House Chief of Staff. And it is implied that the Prime Minister can authorize extra-judicial killings in another sovereign country, even though that is illegal in the United Kingdom.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Above all, in addition to their absurdity, most characters are over-the-top or just plainly annoying: the Ambassador, the Ambassador's husband, the CIA' Station Chief, the Deputy Chief of Mission, I can't really decide which one is more insufferable. The Ambassador in particular is completely reckless bordering on total irresponsibility, has horrible \"people skills\" and hygiene, and, yet, is presented as someone who is being considered as the possible next Vice-President of the United States and, by implication with a senile President, possibly a next President herself.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Overall, this series seems to reflect what has unfortunately become the mainstream perspective of the American left today, but is presented as factual by Netflix. !&lt;",

That wasn't babysitting. I don't recall him struggling in any way during the show. \n\nTo be fair, I think the series did imply declining American influence as well, not just British declining influence. Though it's possible they were placing blame on Trump for that, and the diplomats under a Democrat administration are still trying to clean up and repair the situation. Which would play into your theory. I agree this was presented with views of the American left. I'm not complaining about that. ;)",

In another scene, the Chief of Staff asks what was the last the time the President was allowed to be in a room with someone else alone and implies that such thing should not happen. And the Ambassador says to the President that, during a G20 meeting in Brazil, the host kept offering him \"pee breaks\" every 15 minutes, fueling the speculation that the President suffered from urinary incontinence.\n\nI rest my case.",

Hal's speech clearly moved the MP, and that's probably why he wanted to talk to him. \n\nIf Kate had taken half a second to listen to what Hal wanted to say about the MP, instead of automatically assuming that the man who's stood by her side for years, was just using her, she would've gotten a reliable source against Trowbridge (or whoever's behind the attacks), instead she has a dead MP, and a potentially dead husband and DCM\n\nKate thinks that Hal is somehow both a mastermind who can manipulate the hierarchy of the Whitehouse from his couch, while also treating him like an absolute liability that will turn everything he touches into shit.",

The dude actually seems to be doing everything he can to support her, eventhough she treats him like a nuisance.",

There's a person in her office who is gender neutral - appears to have been born female but dresses either ambiguous or male with suits and bow ties. Yet she has to constantly say \"no skirts.\" The point has been made - any staff who continues to push her to wears skirts should be fired or reprimanded. It shouldn't be a daily conversation.\n\nI don't work in politics. However, the Chairman of the Board, the CEO, and the majority of the executives at my company are women. I couldn't tell you the last time I saw any of them wearing a skirt. And the Chairman is 85+ years old! Ok, my boss likes to wear skirts and dresses. But honestly, she kinda looks out of place when she does. It's just completely not an issue that is ever discussed at my office. Not even at \"functions,\" to my knowledge.\n\nWithin the context of this show, I understand that there are official functions in British society that have a dress code. But work meetings shouldn't require so much discussion.",

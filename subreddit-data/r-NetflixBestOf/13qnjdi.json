    "postText": "Ok first hello Everyone \ud83d\ude0a . So basically ive posted here before about a request for any form of media ( Novels / manga+manhwa+manhua / TV movies+series / comics ) that has atleast 1 or 2 characters who are super smart without specificying the plot/vibe .\n\nHowever here i want recommendations about any media that has its world and plot revolving around Games/Fixed Situations that requires the person to have quick-witted brain and a cunning personality to survive/win in it \n\n\nIf anyone who have read ( No game no life / Classroom of the elite / the hunger games / Maze runner / Liar game / usogui / battle game in 5 seconds / tomodachi game / doubt / escape room / closed room mafia / acma : game / Kakegurui / Akagi / Gambling emperor legend Zero )\n\n will know what i mean basically ? \n\nBut if u have some work that has any smart characters in it then im also fine with that but please mention that its not about ( games/Fixed situations ) \n\nAnd thank you very much \ud83d\ude0a \ud83d\udc4b",

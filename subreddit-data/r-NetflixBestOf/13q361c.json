It has its problems like any other, and if you haven\u2019t seen it be forewarned of spoilers in this video. But otherwise I wanted to share my thoughts of this film starring Eddie Redmayne and Jessica Chastain. \n\nSee below. Enjoy! \n\n[The Good Nurse Review](https://youtu.be/sx87iV5sPCw)",

I blame the hospitals as much as him. Read or listen to it! If u liked the movie, u will love the book.",

About a year later, I had a patient whose family had lost a family member (can't remember exactly who sis, mom, dad...) to his evil, and they were so freaked to be back at the hospital.  Nursing supervisor gave a heads up about who they were and to treat them w kid  gloves. Be extra attentive, sensitive to their needs, and explain all before procedures, blah, blah...I, of course, try to do those things anyway, but seeing this family and the fear they had, u could just feel it, like an under current....my heart broke for them. I thought of how he was always real quiet, never smiled, always doing something on the floor, even when the rush was over and we were charting or bullshitting and I thought \"I should of known\". Maybe if I worked w him more...  I only worked with him a few times, at 2 different hospitals.  When I  worked with him at the other hospital, there was familiarity, and that freaked me out after hearing about it. I thought,  \" this weirdo knows me\".",

At first, Pepe\u2019s supervisors agreed that Cullen was probably the guilty party, but then they changed their minds.

How would cops suspect it if someone hadnt alerted them? At that point no death certificate stated homicide.  When the nurses saw outrageous lab values ( dig level of 9.9 and hypoglycemia levels that were outrageous,) they contacted poison control. Poison control stated immediately, \" u have a police matter on your hands,\"  and he was probably reported to higher-ups from fellow nurses... but to my knowledge, and in the book, no nurse contacted the police. All the nurses were brought in for questioning, and they could tell that Amy was different. Even she did not know or suspect until the cops showed her proof.  I remember it like it was yesterday and the articles that followed. Imo, the administrators of various hospitals should have been charged with holding evidence. They lied about the logs on the pyxis and stated they could only go back 30 days. Amy single handly smuggled printouts from the hospital.  The cops were interviewed in length for the book.  When the hospital first alerted them, they had no idea...it gets into their back story, CC back story, and also Amy's.  You will find it fascinating, especially since you know the area and hospitals.  Did u know CC actually donated a kidney from jail to a family member of one of his victims? F*cking fascinating!",

Redmayne\u2019s performance is one of his worst - incredibly one-note except for one scene that was so bad it left me wondering if they had handed it to him ten minutes before shooting. Jessica Chastain does everything she can with a thankless script and film, but even she can only bring the movie up to being mediocre. The writer and director even made a baffling choice in the third act to deviate from what actually happened in such a way that it creates a plot hole and makes the movie less interesting. \n\nDo yourself a favor, skip the movie and read the book.",

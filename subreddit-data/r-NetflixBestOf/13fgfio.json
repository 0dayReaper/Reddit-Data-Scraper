    "postText": "\n\nIt's soothing, heartwarming and a feel-good show. It is funny, thoughtful and reminds one about the value of good company and the difference it can make in our lives . The visuals and the shots are aesthetically pleasing. The show has a home-made, rustic feel to it.\n\n A Japanese show, made in 2014, that is underrated and deserves a lot more love! The last day to watch it on Netflix is 31 May. \n\nAs the title suggests, it is about the lives of people who frequent a small midnight diner run by a man, all by himself. Regular customers become friends and along with the Master (nickname given to the owner of the diner by the customers), they become akin to a close-knit family, knowing important parts of each others' lives.",

The mystery is so-so, but the thriller is pretty good and the dialogue between the two cops is outstanding.    \n* Stranger - (2 seasons, but they have little to do with each other) - The first season of Stranger is nearly perfect TV. A prosecutor who has had the emotions literally cut out of his head and a spunky investigator chase corruption in the Prosecutor's office all the way to the Blue House (White House of South Korea). The second season is good, but it deals with who in Korea has jurisdiction over the investigation of cases, the cops or prosecutors. Since that's not how we do things in the US, it couldn't hold my interest as well. It's not bad, it just didn't resonate with me like the first season.    \n* Signal - A profiler from 2015 and a cop from 1998 join forces via a time-connected walkie talkie to solve crimes. That sounds terrible. It's not.:)",

The lead actresses are both great. \n\nPart of the story is about how the victims are re-victimized by the justice system, in a variety of ways.  It\u2019s all based on a true story and those parts are heartbreaking. \n\nThe detective parts are spot on.  Great series.\n\nEdited: a word",

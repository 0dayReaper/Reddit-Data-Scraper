Some of them you\u2019ll find bits of on YouTube at the very least.\n\n\nPeep Show, FFO cringe comedy\n\nRed Dwarf, comedy with sci-if elements but primarily a comedy.\n\nLimmy\u2019s Show, sketch show, you might know the guy from [this meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/limmy-waking-up) and the steel\u2019s heavier than feather\u2019s sketch\n\nStill Game, comedy about pensioners set in a fictional Scottish town. A spin-off from sketches in the show Chewin the Fat, but Still Game is far superior and more popular for good reason imo. A couple of the cast are also in Dear Green Place, comedy revolving round park maintenance staff. Still Game is definitely the best of the 3 though\n\nMy Family, solid family based comedy with a grumpy dentist dad, goes downhill a bit when Kris Marshall (who plays loveable dope/slacker Nick) leaves the show\n\nThis is Jinsy, surreal comedy set on the fictional island of Jinsy. Don\u2019t really know how else to describe it so I\u2019ll leave it at that\n\nHarry Hill\u2019s TV Burp might be a bit confusing if you\u2019re not familiar with the source material, but not completely, I don\u2019t know all the shows he takes the piss out of.\n\nChucklevision. I won\u2019t even describe this one, enjoy.\n\nGreen Wing, comedy set in a hospital. The neighbour Jim from Friday Night Dinner (played by Mark Heap) is in it\n\nSpaced, comedy based around 2 flat mates pretending to be a couple and their associates (Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and again Mark Heap are in it)\n\nI\u2019m Alan Partridge, the life of a sad radio DJ (former TV presenter) who lives in a hotel and then an unfinished house\n\nBrasseye and The Day Today, satire. The former having themed episodes (Drugs, Animals etc), the latter satirising news shows.\n\n15 Stories High, 2 flatmates living in a tower block, with strange neighbours we occasionally see tiny snippets of.\n\nLeague of Gentlemen, weird villagers is about all I can say about it\n\nToast of London, a (due to mainly his own character) down on his luck actor (played by Matt Berry) deals with crap acting gigs",

The author of the books changed how he wrote Smiley to match Alec Guinness's portrayal. \n\nAnd of course the original House of Cards 1980 miniseries.

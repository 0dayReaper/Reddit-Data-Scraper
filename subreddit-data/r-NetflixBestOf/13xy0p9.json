Some of us are old enough to remember the last writer's strike and the shows that didn't survive.  So,  while the studios and streamers continue try to screw over the creatives that make their industry possible,  what shows are you concerned may not have the juice to get the chance to continue?",

For example, I really loved Sandman. I\u2019m a big comic nerd and thought it was a solid adaptation and just so cool to see on the screen. I would love to see versions of A Doll\u2019s House or Thermidor. \n\nAnd if it was cancelled tomorrow and we never got Season 2, I\u2019d be disappointed for all of 3 seconds because instead of that maybe I\u2019ll finally get around to The Diplomat or Season 2 of SweetTooth or finally finish Godless or fix the fact that I\u2019ve never seen frame one of Ozark or\u2026 or check out something on another service where I have the exact same problem.\n\nEdit: this statement should not be construed as anything but full throated support for the writers\u2019 strike.",

Most jobs that require one person to do more than what they're paid to do or can physically/mentally do in a healthy work environment,  will need to add additional staff in order to make that environment healthy. I've also heard about this weird staffing thing shows will do where they bring in a bunch of writers for shifts that keep them under the hours needed for benefits and basically use them as low paid gig workers then bring in a new group to take over the next day. I may have the details fuzzy, but that's one thing the WAG wants to stop. As far as streaming services not having the money,  that's laughable.  They're so high in the profit stratosphere. They're in that place where they get to be shady about how much they're even making. Seth Rogan spoke to that recently. If someone with more insight can elaborate or clarify,  please do,  I just know outsider gist of things.",

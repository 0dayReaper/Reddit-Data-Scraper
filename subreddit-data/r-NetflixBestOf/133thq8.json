    "postText": "I loved the first season. Although I wasn\u2019t a fan of the female character. She\u2019s just not powerful and I don\u2019t see her character development at all. I was really looking forward to season 2 but I\u2019m halfway through and I just don\u2019t find it good for some reason. Maybe because I\u2019m not a fan of the romance between Alina and Maleyn and much prefer General Kirigan instead but the whole romance going on is kinda boring tbh. Is it worth continuing or should I drop it? It\u2019s been a few weeks since I\u2019ve watched it and still haven\u2019t been able to continue watching it since.",

It's not that she's not powerful, but she doesn't do much with the power she has gained, and continues chasing more objects of power rather than training herself.\n\nThe crows storyline is much more interesting as another commenter has said. It feels like Kaz's gang is stealing the show, while Alina is dragging her feet going on side quests.",

He loves himself and power more than her. Her romance with her best friend isn't the most exciting this season but there is plenty of other excitement. The way they part at the end seemed too careless for what had just happened prior. I hope for romance with her and the prince next season because he is really handsome, respects her, and I love the way he looks at her. Made me melt lol. Gives me potential love of her life vibes tbh. It wasn't perfect but I would give it a solid 7.5 overall. I say keep watching.",

It was just so cringy I couldn\u2019t keep watching and I gave it multiple shots. They completely butchered Gerneral Kirigan\u2019s character he lost all the charisma he had in the books and just comes over as an over the top flamboyant character in the show. The worst thing for me was Alina. She was so bland and clingy and weak and that\u2019s not even touching on the bad acting. The only good thing about the show was the crows plot-line, so you can watch for that.",

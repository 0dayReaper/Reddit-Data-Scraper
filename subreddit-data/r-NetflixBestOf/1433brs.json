But when I looked it up it said that Netflix never asked for permission of the victims, which I\u2019m not sure is true or not. If it is, well, that seems pretty messed up to me. I\u2019m not even sure how entirely accurate these episodes are. What do y\u2019all think?",

            "comment": "I don't know the details, but at least in the US, in some cases, you can absolutely make a film or documentary about a public figure without their permission. I guess since Dahmer was such a notorious serial killer, he and his victims fall under this umbrella.\n\nAlthough of course it would have been nice if they asked the victims first.",

It is innocent until proven guilty but it doesn't seem that way. But without a doubt all victims should remain anonymous in most news stories and any media unless they give express consent imo. \n\nSome countries do have varying degrees of these laws.",

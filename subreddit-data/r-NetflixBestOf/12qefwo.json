And honestly my story is way more complex than that, as I'm sure your story is, too.\n\nI can see how my original comment might come across as minimizing though, and I'll update it to say it was an episode.

While I definitely enjoyed the 1995 series, something about the warm muted tones in the 2005 version helps soothe me during stressful times.\n\nI know this may seem like a strange choice since I don't think it's on Netflix, but Bridesmaids (2011) starring Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy. Especially, the scene where McCarthy's character visits Wiig's character and tells her \"You're your problem ... and you're also your solution\". I find that quote rather empowering since it reminds me that I do have control over my life and can find solutions to my problems.",

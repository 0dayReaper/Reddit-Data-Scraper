Sam was the black man who developed a romance with Kate Barlow when she was a school teacher. Kate became the outlaw, Kissin' Kate Barlow, after Sam was murdered because he was a black man in a relationship with a white woman. Their story was only a few generations before the present day, where as the story of the curse goes back much farther.",

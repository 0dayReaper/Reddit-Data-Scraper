It is a Netflix original documentary series that explores the natural world from the perspective of the animals that live there. In the episode **Frozen Worlds**, the show takes a look at Antarctica and the effects of climate change on the continent. The episode shows how the melting ice is revealing new land and ecosystems, and how this is impacting the animals that live there.\n\n&gt;Here is a link to the episode on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/80192740",

I would summarize what I know of that story, but apparently the 82 movie is a pretty accurate adaptation of it, and the one from 1951 is quite different.",

They tried using practical effects but it just wasn\u2019t working out so they went with CG and I think that\u2019s most people\u2019s complaints.

One of the things that makes The Thing so good is that a lot of it\u2019s existence is shrouded in mystery. Putting a spotlight on it can tend to detract from the original. I liken it to the current run of Star Trek Shows. Spock is now friends with every captain of the enterprise, kind of cheapens him and Kirk\u2019s relationship. I did really enjoy The Thing (2011), albeit, not until I saw it again. you should give it a rewatch for sure! It\u2019s on Netflix I think.",

There are scenes of ice flows breaking up in that that are quite breathtaking. I'm not sure if it's still on Netflix. It's a documentary that everyone should see, especially those who still refuse to accept climate change is actually happening.",

    "postText": "Netflix is being sued for its Black representation of Cleopatra in its latest docudrama. The debate about the Queen of Egypt\u2019s origins has raged for decades, but this latest backlash is among the strongest. Why is her race among Egyptians causing so much dispute, two thousand years after her death? \n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/13gqzj9/video/whbodupdlnza1/player",

Please listen- all that may be true but we KNOW that the Ptolomies did not marry anyone other than other Ptolomies (preferred- usually brother sister, but also uncle/aunt:niece nephew). This was their family practice.  They did not intermarry with Egyptians and non Greeks. Most did not even speak Egyptian. The Ptolomies ruled Egypt only because if and through their Greek connection. Ptolomey I stole Alexander the Greats body and stuck it in a massive mausoleum in the middle of Alexandria for a reason.  They were Greek. Exclusively.",

There\u2019s a reason the Ptolomues had Alexander the Greats body on display and it was not to illustrate their intermarriage with native populations.",

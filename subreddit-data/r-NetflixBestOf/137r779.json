The main family is meant to be not likable in that first season but as they mature you grow to love them.  It lands a cathartic ending that doesn\u2019t feel cheesy or over done in the end too.  Well worth the ride.",

Janeway)\n- Deep Space Nine (Commander Sisko)\n\nThere are a lot of seasons with a lot of episodes, there\u2019s an over-archiving theme for the entire show (we are exploring space and oops, a problem!; we got lost in space and want to go home, and oops, a problem!; we discovered something in space and have to deal with the consequences now, so oops, many problems, but also the aftermath of and recovery after occupation!), but every episode can stand alone and is usually resolved at the end of the episode. For 90s shows, I feel like they are easily digestible - no or very rare sexism, racism, etc., at least among the humans. We have strong, multi-dimensional and flawed women, and I believe, Deep Space Nine was one of the first Black led shows with a mixed cast (also, Black joy, and Black father-son love, which is so rare, even today!).\n\nSo, for me, this is the perfect casual watching - very bingeable, the theme is clear, the smaller issue usually gets resolved in the same episode while contributing to the entire story arch, occasional action, occasional joy, occasional learning, and rarely anything brutally cringe.",

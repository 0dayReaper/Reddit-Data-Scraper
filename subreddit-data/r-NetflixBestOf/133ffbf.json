It was a very deprived area, a massive difference between the upper and lower classes. There was a \"soft\" prison that was full of people serving short sentences, usually drug related. The population was full of drug addicts. There was barely a day that went by without finding used needles, people spaced out in doorways and even worse, people who had overdosed under the bridges (it was so common people just avoided those walkways). It was wild in 90s Scotland.",

Beau gave me a feeling of purity and innocence, with concern and care for his well being. The ending scene was devastating though. I felt so sad for him.",

I didn't realize I had been holding my breath until the flare goes out in the sandstorm and everything goes quiet. I literally let my breath out completely on reflex and it was loud. Very embarrassing but I couldn't help myself. Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time and easily my favorite theater experience.",

Man, did I sell it short. Great movie. Funny, heartfelt, and yeah. It definitely took direct aim and my nostalgia glands. Space Guy is *literally* how I rolled as a kid, locked in my room building spaceships out of whatever set I got and avoiding my parents fighting outside.

By the end of it you can really feel his exhaustion and almost a at peace with whatever happens next state of mind.",

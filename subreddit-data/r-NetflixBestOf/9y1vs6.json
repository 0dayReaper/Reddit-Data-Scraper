Thrilling and surprising.  Extremely well paced.  Beautifully shot and equally beautiful scenery.  Some of the best written dialogue and characters. A near perfect film in my opinion. I strongly recommend it to virtually anyone who hasn't seen it.  \n\nThe same writer/director as Seven Psychopaths and Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri (and in my opinion, the best of the three).

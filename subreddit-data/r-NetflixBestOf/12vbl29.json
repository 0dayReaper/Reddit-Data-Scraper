Both are solid stories with endings that weren't cancelled. OB has some fantastic acting from the lead character. 12 Monkeys has a wonderful series finale. Both have excellent supporting ensemble casts as well. \n\nBlack Sails (Starz) and the Americans (Hulu) both start off with some high octane openings before settling in to some political conflict and slow burn drama. Warning, flashes of extreme tension and/or action highly likely. Amazing stories with uncanceled freaking fantastic finales. \n\nSense8 (Netflix) is a beautifully shot show that is engaging but will have you questioning what exactly the hell is going on for the first few episodes. Heads up it can be pretty heavy on the nudity/sexuality for anyone who doesn't like that sort of thing. \n\nThe Bear (Hulu) throws you right in the chaos of running a kitchen in Chicago. Anxiety inducing show but really damn good. Only one season so far.",

I don't need everyone to be a pollyanna, and I like complex characters that struggle with being their worst selves, but I can't get into shows where every character makes me want to choke them out. I have to like SOMEONE. \n\nUnlikable characters are why I couldn't get into Succession. Like, all those people are straight up assholes with no redeeming qualities, and I don't find that entertaining in the least bit.",

It\u2019s a few years old I thought it was on Netflix. It was called manhunt: unabomber. It was a limited series but quite good. I guess Netflix took it off late last year for some reason but check that out. Idk where it could be watched but it was good. Dopesick on Hulu was a powerful Show that caught my attention right away and based on real life with corrupt Purdue pharmaceuticals that was run by Richard sackler and the highly addictive pain relief medicine OxyContin I believe. Great series. Big actors in it like Michael Keaton and the actress did great in drama acting despite previously known in comedy on Tim Allen\u2019s last man standing show who plays the Tom boy daughter on the show .",

They don\u2019t give their shows room to breathe. It\u2019s either a viral sensation or it\u2019s cancelled. Imagine if Always Sunny was made today and started off on Netflix. It would surely be cancelled after 1 season, but just look how popular the show is today. That\u2019s such a common thing in television. Even The Office had a terrible start with low viewership. Breaking Bad was considered a \u201ccult show\u201d for the first 3 seasons. Some projects just need time to capture a wider audience. \n\nThey need to pick their projects carefully and trust the creators more. Right now it\u2019s like they\u2019re just spinning a wheel and saying \u201cyeah we\u2019ll give you a shot\u201d and then hoping the show is an overnight hit. If it\u2019s not then they just move on to the next one. It\u2019s an infuriating method for a lot of reasons, but I guess it makes more money than actually giving shows a chance to get off the ground.",

It wasn\u2019t super super layered but it did what it wanted to. Managed to make me feel a little something while still being funny. Dark comedy is pretty apt. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a superstar character/performance here like in the consensus classics of the last 20 years but everyone cast nailed the notes even if they weren\u2019t that layered of characters. (There was more than met the eyes to them in universe but to the viewer they pretty much hit the two leads pretty much just continuously played the same two notes but played them perfectly)",

They are mentally ill and that manifests as anger and the thirst for revenge. Of course you and I would think it\u2019s not worth it, but we\u2019re acting on logic. These two are all emotions. And they don\u2019t really care what it costs them because ||they both have contemplated suicide|| and they both like to be a glutton for pain so they can use it as some sort of vindication for their own actions. A lot of miserable people like perpetuating it. Even normal people like to boast about who worked more that day or who got less sleep.\n \nSure some people might break up if they\u2019re on the other side of the freeway, but plenty of people don\u2019t. Plenty of people continue dating people all across town or drive across town for work (this is why we have traffic in LA).\n \nI\u2019m not sure what kind of movies/tv you normally watch but an hour and a half of traffic is such a small thing to ignore compared to what some other stories ask you to excuse. Especially considering they only do this a few times during the show. Additionally Daniel\u2018s work probably takes him all over the city, so not really an inconvenience for him (especially since he drives far just to go to a Burger King that he thinks has the best food). And as a business owner Amy probably has meetings all over town too.",

The final episode was a masterpiece. Maybe because I\u2019m Asian American- but this resonates with me deeply in a way that has nothing to do with the \u201croad rage\u201d theme. I\u2019m a chill driver.",

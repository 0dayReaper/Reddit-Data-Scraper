Wentworth is a women's prison drama from Australia and has one of the best TV villains I've ever seen starting in season 2. If you loved Vikings you'll love the Last Kingdom. If you enjoy zombies/horror, check out Kingdom from south Korea. Dark is an excellent German show that is as extraordinary as it is confusing. That's definitely one where you want to take advantage of the subreddit. The Sandman is a great fantasy show that is visually stunning. If you're at all interested in anime, check out Arcane and Castlevania. Feel free to drop me some recommendations back!",

Not a series.\nI will start Dark, then Wentworth. \nDefinitely a shortage of good series right now. The Serpent was good.\nEastern Promises is a superb movie leaving this month, as is Heat\nSome Nordic Noir series worth checking out are: Deadwood, Valhalla Murders, The Chestnut Man",

The only other one you mentioned that I've seen is deadwood so I'll check out your other recommendations. I'm a big fan of foreign shows. I really enjoyed the Criminal series and they have one in Spain, Germany and the UK. It's just a suspect in an Interrogation room and we have to figure out what the person is suspected of by the questions the detective is asking. They have some great guest stars to play the criminals. You'd probably also really like Sherlock but it's not on Netflix anymore.",

Derry Girls is a hilarious Irish comedy with 30 minute episodes that's nice when you're not in the mood for anything too heavy. The new Luther movie is freaking amazing! It's very British and very creepy. Not British but Narcos Mexico is fantastic and the series is over so it's bing eable. I know I already mentioned Castlevania but it's so good I'm mentioning it again. They've got Jamie Murray and the guy who played Gaius Baltar on Battlestar Galactica doing voicework in it. It's anime but so well done and the voice actors are all British and eastern European.",

Funnier than it sounds, it\u2019s probably the one that made me laugh loudest in this list \n\n- romantic killer: romcom love-square that has excellent scenarios and jokes. Sometimes even goes serious \n\n- kotaro lives alone: cute four year old lives alone, adults in the same apartment block try to understand wtf is going on. Sweet, sometimes a little sad\n\n- aggretsuko: red panda in boring dead end office job vents frustration in karaoke bars screaming death metal and stuff. I got tired of it \n\n- Komi can\u2019t communicate: cute rom com series about a girl who has severe social anxiety and struggles to talk and the first dude who gets through to her and of course falls in love and offers to help her make friends. Some of the characters are unhinged and it can be quite funny \n\n-",

    "postText": "My favorite show is Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. I love how chaotic and goofy it is. It's a world where sentient puppets and traveling by blimp are normal. I'm looking for similar sitcoms like Community where paintball is taken way too seriously but also just another Tuesday, Superstore where you can adopt a teen on a whim cuz you're embarrassed not to, and Brooklyn 99 where the banter is so quick and wild.\n\nI've also seen Schitt's Creek, Great News, Girls5Eva, P&amp;R, 30 Rock, Ghosts, Fresh Off the Boat, Kim's Convenience, Animal Control, Arrested Development, and Ghosted. I can't stand laughtrack, mostly only like things from the last decade, and the less sex the better. Thanks for any leads!",

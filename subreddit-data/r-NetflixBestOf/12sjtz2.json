None of my family would watch it with me, but I really liked it.   \n**\"Will Trent\"** on Hulu is good; it's a \"Law and Order\"-type show.   \n**\"Accused\"** on Hulu is good.  \n**\"The Imperfects\"** on Netflix was okay; I watched the entire series.   \n**\"Into the Night\"** has two seasons and was really good.  \n**If you are okay with reading, Unless they have it dubbed**  \n**\"Backstreet Rookie\"** is a hilarious Korean series on Netflix (with my favorite Korean actress, Kim Yoo-jung). Watch anything with her in it.  \n**\"Little Women\"** is a great Korean drama about three sisters who somehow find themselves at the center of rich political drama. Loved this series.  \n**\"Attorney Woo\"** is another great Korean series about a brilliant attorney with autism.  \n**\"Sky Castle\"** is another good Korean drama about rich parents pressuring their children to excel in school and a murder mystery.  \n**\"Rookie Historian Goo Hae Ryung\"** is a good Korean historical drama.   \n**\"Green Mothers Club\"** is another kind of mystery drama.   \n**\"My Only Love Song\"** is hilarious.   \n**\"A Model Family\"** is a Korean series about a man who finds two people dead in a van full of money. And he's dumb but takes the money.  \n*If you like anime,*   \n**\"Demon Slayer\"** on Netflix is great.   \n**\"Death Note\"** is really good.   \n**\"Nezha Reborn\"** is another anime series you might enjoy.  \n\u00a0This is alot LOL!",

You're only limited by how small a particle you're using to remember the information (grooves in plastic for a record, magnetic domains for tape ... I'm not sure for film, but I think those little silver particles are measured ~[in microns](http://www.tmax100.com/photo/pdf/film.pdf).)\n\nThe first step in a digital recording is breaking that nice fluid analog signal into chunks.  Granted we've come a long way and are making lots of *very tiny* pieces that, when put back together, are very close to the original signal.  But digital fidelity is still limited by how finely we can chop up information rather than how accurately our medium allows us to capture it.",

Gathering up the men is a tale in itself but after a bit of a party at Camelot, many decide to leave only to be stopped by God who sends them on a quest\\: to find the Holy Grail. After a series of individual adventures, the knights are reunited but must face a wizard named Tim, killer rabbits and lessons in the use of holy hand grenades. Their quest comes to an end however when the police intervene - just what you would expect in a Monty Python movie.\n(*IMDb*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Monty+Python+and+the+Holy+Grail+%281975%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monty%20Python%20and%20the%20Holy%20Grail), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/monty_python_and_the_holy_grail), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/monty-python-and-the-holy-grail), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/771476), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q25043).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2Fabz4ro \"Confidence: 1.07\").

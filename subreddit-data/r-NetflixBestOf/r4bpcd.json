    "postText": "When I made this sub, Netflix was the only streaming service in existence, landscape has changed a lot in recent years, that's why I typically don't auto remove recommendations pointing outside of Netflix anymore... Curious what the community thinks though.  Little awkward that the names of subs can't be changed, but it is what it is, I guess.  I don't envision any changes in the lax moderation rules, other than appropriate tagging by platform.  Thoughts?\n\nEdit: if I set up flair by platform, would people be able to filter by that?",

A country might be on Netflix in country A, on prime in country B and on a local single-country streaming service in country C. And of course, that changes over time. So filters on reddit, would at most be helpful for a very limited set of people, for a limited set of time.\n\nSites like https://www.justwatch.com/ will automatically tell you what platforms are streaming a linked show based on the country of the visitor. So maybe having people link to these websites instead of directly to Netflix, Hulu, would be very helpful.",

Don't watch the live action film with Van Damme, that was awful.\n\nMortal Kombat recently animated set of movies also very good - think they are called mortal Kombat legends. There are 3 released so far, first one focuses on Scorpion...\n\nCastlevania is great, whether you have played the games or not the story is easy to follow and the animation and action is top notch\n\nThe last of us - follows the game closely and Neil Druckman is involved with the series",

I hear it's good. The animation is pretty lousy.\n\nIt's too bad The Witcher Netflix show turned out the way it did. I couldn't get through two episodes. Same with Dragon's Dogma, and I'm a huge fan of the latter.",

It is one of the most difficult arias because of its length, its soaring arpeggios, and the high F above high C.!&lt;\n* &gt;!At the end of the movie, when Korben's mother calls, and the President passes off the phone, you can hear her complaining, \"I might as well throw myself into traffic, Saran Wrap myself to the bed and pretend my child is suffocating me.\" She is listing off previous scenes within the movie.!&lt;\n* &gt;!The explosion in the Fhloston main hall was the largest indoor explosion ever filmed. !&lt;\n* &gt;!The \"Divine Language\", spoken by Leeloo, was invented by co-Writer and Director Luc Besson, and further refined by Milla Jovovich, who had little trouble learning and developing it, as she was already fluent in four languages. The language had only four hundred words. He and Milla Jovovich held conversations, and wrote letters to each other in the language as practice. By the end of filming, they were able to have full conversations in this language.!&lt;\n* &gt;!At the time, it was the most expensive movie ever produced outside of Hollywood, most expensive production in Gaumont's history, and at eighty million U.S. dollars, the visual effects budget of the movie was the highest of its time.!&lt;\n* &gt;!When Composer \u00c9ric Serra showed soprano Inva Mula (who dubs the voice of the Diva) the sheet music for the Diva Dance, she relayed to him that some of the notes written were not humanly possible to achieve because the human voice cannot change notes that fast. Hence, she performed the notes in isolation, one by one, as opposed to consecutively singing them all together and they digitized the notes to fit the music. There are a few moments when you can hear the differences in the vocal tones of The Diva's voice. !&lt;\n* &gt;!Luc Besson demanded that most of the action shots in the movie take place in broad daylight, as he was reportedly tired of the dark spaceship corridors and dimly lit planets common in science fiction movies, and wanted a brighter \"cheerfully crazy\" look as opposed to a gloomy, realistic one.!&lt;\n* &gt;!When filming began, the production decided to dye Milla Jovovich's hair from its natural brown color to her character's signature orange color. However, Milla's hair quickly became too damaged and broken to withstand the dye. Eventually a wig was created to match the color and style of Leeloo's hair, and was used for the remainder of the production.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Bruce Willis ad-libbed the line \"look lady, I only speak two languages, English and bad English.\"!&lt;\n* &gt;!The wonder on Bruce Willis' face when the Diva sings is real. That was the first time he'd heard it and seen the actress in full make-up.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Vin Diesel provided the voice of Finger, but didn't receive any on-screen credit.!&lt;\n* &gt;!According to the Ultimate Edition DVD, Prince and Michael Jackson were sources of inspiration for the part of Ruby Rhod, and both were even considered for the role, with Prince being the first choice.!&lt;\n* &gt;!When Korben first meets Leeloo, and she starts talking to him in her language, Luc Besson didn't tell Bruce Willis what Milla Jovovich was going to say to him, so Bruce's reactions are real.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Plavalaguna, Diva's name, is actually composed of two words: Plava and Laguna. \"Plava\" in Serbian, Croatian, Montenigrin, and Bosnian language means Blue (feminine, masculine would be \"plav\"). \"Laguna\" in the same languages means lagoon. So her name is Blue Lagoon.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Zorg's monologue about destruction creating productivity is actually a classic economics fallacy exposed in \"The Parable of the Broken Window\" written by French economist Frederic Bastiat in 1850. The full essay is called \"Ce qu'on voit et ce qu'on ne voit pas\" (\"That Which Is Seen and That Which Is Not Seen\").!&lt;\n* &gt;!Cartoonist Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res of \"My Fifth Element\", also says that Luc Besson approached him for ideas, telling him: \"I want to make a movie based on your visuals. But I am ready to pay you for the work.\" The nuance is because there has long been a controversy that many elements in the Star Wars saga were lifted almost unmodified out of Valerian!&lt;\n* &gt;!Elizabeth Berkley auditioned for the role of Leeloo, but after the failure of Showgirls (1995), studios were reluctant to hire her.!&lt;\n* &gt;!It took a team of eighty workers five months to build the models used in this movie.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Milla Jovovich beat out over three thousand women who auditioned for the role of Leeloo.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Jean Reno was the original choice for the part of Korben Dallas.!&lt;\n* &gt;!The parasites being disinfected from the landing gear of the spaceship (bound for Fhloston Paradise) by a team in sealed suits are actually Boglins, the 1980s puppet toys. With them is a Bumble Ball, a battery-operated shaking and vibrating ball covered with rubber knobs.!&lt;\n* &gt;!When the ship leaves Earth for Fhloston Paradise, there's a \"constellation\" of a cat, walking with its tail straight up, in the lower left, right above the rim of the Earth.!&lt;\n* &gt;!The text scrolling across a Times Square theater marquee as Korben dives down through traffic is actually an excerpt from an e-mail dispute between several artists at Digital Domain. Other signs on digital and practical, miniature buildings contain similar in-jokes and references and the large cylindrical tanker truck that Korben's cab almost hits at the end of his descent is decorated with the logo of a Venice, California, pizza parlor that was a favorite of Digital Domain artists.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Luc Besson wrote this story in high school and made the hero a taxi driver because his own father worked a second job as a taxi driver. He did this to support Luc going to art school. Luc has a taxi driver in almost all of his movies to honor his father.!&lt;\n* &gt;!The actors inside the Mondoshawan suits used mini television monitors to see where they were going. It took three people twenty minutes to dress one Mondoshawan.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Because of the shape of the Mangalore masks, actors had to have sloping foreheads to play them.!&lt;\n* &gt;!WILHELM SCREAM: Heard when Zorg blows up Right Arm at the airport, and when Leeloo tosses two Mangalores out of the Diva's room.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Ruby Rhod's name is an inside joke. One of the original lasers used a ruby rod as the core element.!&lt;\n* &gt;!The Zorg Industries ZF-1 Pod Weapons System was actually based upon an AKSU-74 compact assault rifle.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Jamie Foxx was considered for the part of Ruby Rhod.!&lt;\n* &gt;!The animatronic mechanisms used for the Mangalore masks were later recycled for the Neimodians in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999).!&lt;\n* &gt;!Kevin Costner was considered for the role of General Munro.!&lt;\n* &gt;!The buildings in the New York City miniature were up to twenty feet tall, the street was eighty feet long, and it took nine months to build.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Mel Gibson was considered for the role of Korben Dallas.!&lt;\n* &gt;!The Mangalores wear goggles to save money on make-up.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Julia Roberts was considered for the role of Leeloo.!&lt;",

Granted he doesn't explicitly say Dallas's name, but the implication is that they knew Dallas had won the contest and needed to get him out of the way in order to impersonate him.](/spoiler)\n\nEdit to add: In fact, in [the script](http://nldslab.soe.ucsc.edu/charactercreator/film_corpus/film_2012xxxx/imsdb.com/Fifth-Element,-The.html) it gives this direction in the middle of Right Hand's lines:\n\n&gt; [He shows him a plane ticket, and a passport with his picture and Korben's\nname.](/spoiler)\n\nGranted that's not how the scene actually ended up in the movie, but it apparently was in the script...",

Only the Fifth Element can stop the Evil from extinguishing life, as it tries to do every five thousand years. She is assisted by a former elite commando turned cab driver, Korben Dallas, who is, in turn, helped by Prince\\/Arsenio clone, Ruby Rhod. Unfortunately, Evil is being assisted by Mr. Zorg, who seeks to profit from the chaos that Evil will bring, and his alien mercenaries.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n&gt; The Fifth Element polarised critics on release. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times described the film as an \"elaborate, even campy sci-fi extravaganza, which is nearly as hard to follow as last year's Mission\\: Impossible.\" He concluded that The Fifth Element was \"a lot warmer, more fun and boasts some of the most sophisticated, witty production and costume design you could ever hope to see.\" On film review show At the Movies, both Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the film a \"thumbs up\"; in his own review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, calling it \"One of the great goofy movies\", and concluding, \"I would not have missed seeing this film, and I recommend it for its richness of imagery. But at 127 minutes, which seems a reasonable length, it plays long.\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Le+cinqui%E8me+%E9l%E9ment+%281997%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The%20Fifth%20Element), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil_extinction/news/1662363/milla_jovovich_on_resident_evil_and_her_ultraviolet_beef/), [Metacritic](https://web.archive.org/web/20150219030926/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-fifth-element), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/1154386), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q106506).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2Fb8x3ei \"Confidence: 1.05\").

The MPAA rating system is a voluntary scheme that is not enforced by law; films can be exhibited without a rating, although certain theaters refuse to exhibit non-rated or NC-17 rated films. Non-members of MPAA may also submit films for rating. Other media, such as television programs, music and video games, are rated by other entities such as the TV Parental Guidelines, the RIAA and the ESRB.\n\nThe MPAA rating system is one of various motion picture rating systems that are used to help parents decide what films are appropriate for their children.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

They did it well with like how they had the women like rose who held their own but also vulnerable. She was tough but caring and it was realistic. They complimented each others weaknesses and strengths between Peter and rose. \n\nBut I liked how much they cared about each other and had each others back. It was cool seeing how she didn\u2019t sit back but she saved his life too and fought alongside him. It was great partnership. I guess both characters showed qualified viewers loved. Seemed like a lot of women fawned over Peters character and I as a man couldn\u2019t help thinking, where\u2019s rose in my life lol. So I feel men felt likewise with roses character. Have you\u2019ve seen the show the recruit? That was pretty good too.",

But it has a different spin, there's some comedy to go along with the action. It's central intelligence related so some relation to nigh agent. But it;s about a young, fresh faced lawyer that decides he wants to join the CIA. He;s a lawyer for the Cia, but with him being a newbie, he has some blunders and you see the amusing trials of him getting his feet wet. But there's things that go down that is pretty interesting to follow. He has two roomates who are lawyers too that he went to college with. One is his ex gf and a guy friend. Hannah is the ex roomates, name, all I know is idk what female character I like more Rose or Hannah, she's pretty cool too. I think slight edge for Rose. But pretty good show, it's different but there are funny comedy spins to this unlike night agent. So a blend of humor with action plot too",

Plus Peter and rose and dialogue. The fighting was set where it\u2019s realistic too. Not overdone stuff.I don\u2019t like disturbing stuff and beef seemed like it would be too much . Night agent shows things can be intense without being like that. It\u2019s more than simple fun, I\u2019m not one to watch too many suspense shows because they don\u2019t seem original. This didn\u2019t just jump to action but had a lot of things discovered. The characters got you involved to care how things go with their safety. A well written show gets you emotionally invested and I was. It had me on edge of my seat with end of the episodes. Not to mention the connection was set up well with a slow burn and rose and Peter complimented each other well",

Night agent Just had a nice Broad blend with good suspense, great layers that keep you guessing and other characters. I thought the acting was damn good with actors doing great in their roles. I liked how rose and Peter were written and fight scenes were more realistic too. I do wish night agent had more music tho or more to a soundtrack but wasn\u2019t necessary. It would have kicked ass tho with a kick ass music intro. Maybe with the popularity, season too will have more music",

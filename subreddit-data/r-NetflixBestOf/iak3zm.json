Lou was the one who hired couple of gangsters to break into a wealthy neighborhood and create bloodshed that Lou can use for an exclusive sensational footage that could save the news director\u2019s (old lady director) job. After using the footage, he now schemed to create/direct a rendezvous  of these criminals and police knowing what would happen on such encounter. The second gangster killed Lou\u2019s assistant whom the gangster doesn\u2019t know but left Lou as he is the one who paid him originally to commit home invasion. What\u2019s your take on my theory? Also, to back my theory, Lou could have been to the house where shootings happened before they actually happened because he made that happen.",

This _was notes documentary_. Only the largest 5-10 markets use/employ freelancers and stringers, and even then, not to the degree shown in the movie. That said, there are pseudo-paparrazi freelancers who will chase and hound public figures for tabloid-friendly footage, but not \"news\".\n\nI worked in a top 40 market for 5 years. The volume of people who mistakenly believed that the local media in our market operated like Nightcrawler was upsetting. \n\nAnd when industry professionals attempt to educate and inform the public about the news gathering process, the cynical and curmudgeonly double-down and dismiss such efforts as a cover up or distraction.\n\nI don't know if people just insist on clinging to their fictional fantasy world because it's more exciting or because they simp lo y cannot stand confronting their own bad information.  Whatever the reason, this entertaining movie is also the cause of much ire when I see it cited as a reason that \"the media can't be trusted.\"\n\nUgh.",

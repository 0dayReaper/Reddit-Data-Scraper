I would be curious to hear the opinion of someone who has never seen any other Star Wars movie to see if they think it holds up. The best parts are references to the original. \n\nEdit: spelling",

She only really knows like the bare bone basics of the series (Darth Vader is Luke's dad, the Death Star, Yoda)\n\nShe liked it. The movie is easy to follow in it's plot and she totally understood everything. Donnie Yen's character was her favorite, [and she was sad to see everyone die at the end](/spoiler). I did definitely like the ending more than she did. \n\nI made her watch A New Hope with me later, and she did recognize that it picks up right where Rouge One ends. Because the tone of the movie is so different from what she saw before, I think she actually liked Rogue One much more than A New Hope. Although my girlfriend did say she liked it.",

Maybe because Luke was a positive and charismatic character that you got swept up with him. You root for Jyn... but not much. Everybody in R1 is a miserable boulder.\n\nAnd three of the main characters committed suicide, what the fuck was that. One just stood there and died environmentally and the others actively ran into bullets, right? I don't recall an explanation. Was it the pain of living in that world? :| This is Star Wars, not Apocalypse Now. Serious is fine, easy on the morbid brutality.",

This had been covered in the clone wars tv show, but still.\n\nIf you wanted you could cut the movie to each character and you'd have serveral isolated arcs that tell a story of their own that culminates in a grand moment of the star wars universe. I actually never felt so tense in a star wars moment, perhaps only at the Order 66. \n\nThis has become my favourite star wars movie because it changed my perspective on the future characters. How Han was an asshole that just cared about himself. After we've seen how terrifying the death star was and do a parallel with our reality, how can I not (in a way) despise him?",

I remember when the prequels came out that it was going to be all about how Anikin Skywalker became Darth Vader, and even though I pretty much knew all about how it was going to happen, I was still excited to see it unfold on screen.\n\nThat said, by the time Attack of the Clones was through, my teenage self thought, \"man, this is way longer than it needs to be,\" and \"Anikin is really annoying.\" I couldn't wait for Darth Vader to show up. I was EXCITED to see awful things happen to Anikin just so he'd stop being the disappointment he was and grow into the badass Sith that the original trilogy had firmly established.\n\nI probably imagined the fight scene between Obiwan and Anikin a hundred times in my childhood - everything I'd seen and read to that point told me that the fate of the galaxy riding out on the last man standing, and even though I knew what was going to happen, I needed to see it happen.\n\nSo, it says a lot when, at the point that Anikin had his legs cut off and burst into flames, I couldn't help but laugh in the theater. Like, a full on Nelson Muntz style \"HA-HA!\"\n\nDarth Vader in the prequels did not live up to the hype.\n\nBut then, wait. Rogue One comes out. I have zero expectations going in - Episode 7 was aight, but this was another prequel/gaiden kinda deal and I knew none of the characters. It's entertaining enough to start out, but we get to the third act and what's his face walks into a room with Darth Vader's incubation pod (I never could figure what that thing was), and I'm like \"Darth is finally gonna fuck some shit up.\"\n\nAnd oh yes he did.\n\nDarth Vader's mystique in the original trilogy is built up completely by his reputation: he's someone that even the Space Nazis fear. So, even though he doesn't do much in Ep 1 (aside from kill Obiwan and get shot down), the viewer gets that sense that he's a total badass, in a way that the prequels could not deliver on.\n\nRogue One was the Darth Vader redemption scene I needed.\n\nThis was probably a lot longer than it needed to be, but I suppose all of my nerd rants are.",

We don't know what he is capable of, and it's been 20 years since that day. We need to see that he is still a force not to be taken lightly. If anything, he is stronger now than before.",

He simply has no hesitation like he had in episode 2 and 3, and even then, he was incredibly powerful in relation to most jedi. Also the fact that the jedi have become practically extinct makes him seem so much more powerful.\n\nEdit: Also, his pain which he now meditates on is a source of power.

From the beginning of the movie when she rescues BB8 you learn that she's a good person. She has a mystery around her childhood (just like luke), and a yearning to discover more than just her shitty desert planet (just like luke).\n\nIs it a blatant ANH copy? Maybe. But it worked. At the end of TFA I gave a shit about Rey and I wanted to see more. I watched it 2 more times in theaters because I wanted to see what I missed. I got to see her develop and become her own person and embrace the force.\n\nMeanwhile at the end of Rogue One I was just glad to be out of there. It was a dismal, boring, slog of a movie. Fanboys will claim that it's a war movie, and you aren't supposed to care about the characters but that's a fucking cop out and I feel bad for them if they've never cared about war movie characters. Haven't these heartless monsters seen Saving Private Ryan? Hamburger Hill? Full Metal Jacket?",

Whereas the *The Force Awakens* leads are hamming it up a bit like a romantic comedy, so that combined with their backgrounds make them more likable. Especially for kids, which is who the movie is clearly made for.",

By the films nature, you know where the plot goes so the movie needed good, likeable characters to carry it. Except the characters weren't likeable or enjoyable to watch at all. Despite being nearly a clone of the original, TFA is much better (I'd even put it above RotJ in my rankings) because of the characters and the charisma of the actors, especially Kylo Ren and Rey.\n\nThe only redeeming feature was the battle at the end, but by that point the movie had lost me and it would have been better if I cared about the people fighting.\n\nI didn't even like the Vader scene at the end (though maybe that's just me being a sourpuss). It just screamed \"fanboy wank material\" at me. ",

We all know how the movie has to end so we know what can and can't happen plotwise. For example, when boring-female-protagonist gets the plans to the Death Star she gains plot armor until she delivers them. They tried desperately to make the last 30ish minutes of the move suspenseful but none of that worked because we knew she *had* to get the plans and then *had* to deliver them. They should have included a twist, like stereotypical-villain delivers the plans himself to get revenge on Grandma. You also can't make a movie emotionally compelling by just killing off the entire cast, because none of them were good characters. \n\nBasically the problem was that the movie was completely inconsequential. We knew they would deliver the plans to the Death Star and that's literally all they did. We didn't need it to be a movie. ",

I took it as a sign of good things to come, now that they had those two goals out of the way, and I think that prediction was fully borne out in Rogue One.",

There is not a single likable \"main\" character, it's full of tropes and plot holes, and follows far too many people for the viewer to truly feel connected to any of them. \n\nSpoilers: The only characters I liked were the snarky droid, the blind Force-monk, and the monk's huge gunner friend. After each of them died, there was nobody I actually cared about left in the movie. When everyone else dies at the very end, I felt nothing except a sense of relief that at least the movie was finally over. \n\nEdit: As an example of how the movie doesn't spend enough time on anyone for me to get attached, I personally could not name a single character in the entire film aside from Jyn and Galen Erso (sp?). I've seen The Force Awakens once and I could name probably a dozen or more characters in that film. ",

The first half (or 60% or something) is painfully boring, full of bland characters whose motivations are not at all interesting.\n\nBut everything after the start of the big mission is incredibly entertaining. It's as thrilling as any action sequence in the franchise. The ending finds the perfect tone. You really get a sense of the enormous sacrifices that were made so the rebellion could survive. It manages to add weight to the events of Episodes 4-6 without breaking continuity in any way.",

It's not exactly how I felt watching it, but it's close enough. \n\nFor me, the first 75% of the movie was boring enough that I just didn't care about the protagonists anymore, by the end. And that ruined any emotional connection that the ending might have brought. I didn't care about their sacrifice because it felt meaningless to me. ",

Then he dies and Jyn is barely effected. Jyn was the worst part of the movie imo, because she has zero personality, zero reason for doing anything in the movie besides the fact the plot needed to move forward. I also thought Cassian (took me 2 watch through's to get his name) was unlikable and acted like a dick. The empire pilot who gets killed by a grenade did nothing really besides name drop the title of the movie. The blind force-monk just said sage shit without really meaning anything and his friend said almost nothing to make me care about him. Those  two at least create an atmosphere to make you feel about them though. \n\nOnly the Robot left me feeling like I gave a shit about him at all, and then he was the first to die. I really feel like the movie tricked people into thinking it had heart with a nice looking battle to conclude the 3rd act. \nReally not worth revisiting in my opinion, but I admit the first time through is actually quite fun. The bad character writing really makes the movie unmemorable in the long run though :(.",

He had 40 years of fans to please, ranging from child to senior citizen. he had new fans to please, casual move-goers, and people that pray at the Church of Vader. He had an immensely difficult task to complete, and I think he did it very well.",

There's *still* an evil empire with triangle ships fighting a small rebel group, even though the reasons for both of them to exist are extremely contrived. Might as well not have blown up any Death Stars given how much if ended up mattering.",

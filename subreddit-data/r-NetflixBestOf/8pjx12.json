Netflix will keep these shows forever, they throw money at shows like it's nothing.\n\nThis is another network not renewing a contract and Netflix having no choice.  His death will make it more likely it's coming down on time, because whoever owns it is going to want to throw it up on THEIR streaming service as soon as possible.",

They were first and that was their plan, stream everything from everywhere all in one place.  Just that corporations saw how much consumers wanted it and put a big fat stop to that ASAP to get in on that sweet greed money.",

A number of weeks ago, I watched the _Hokkaido_ episode (Not sure if it was _Parts Unknown_ or _No Reservations)_ and shortly after, I ended booking my first ever trip to Japan. Taking that trip to Tokyo was one of the best decisions I've ever made, and likely the happiest and most wonderful week of my life. I had a conversation with some friends about how I wish I'd been born early enough to be a part of his camera crew, because having those kinds of experiences on an almost daily basis with someone like Anthony seemed like the luckiest and greatest gig in the world. And today, still busy trying to sort through all the photos I took, a coworker tells me of his death. \n\nI get that someone else's suicide is almost always unfathomable and takes you by surprise like nothing else could. But fuck, it just feels like there was some kind of mistake, as if it was supposed to be someone else but whoever was in charge accidentally flicked the wrong switch.\n\nIt's one thing when somebody dies of illness or an accident. It's absolutely tragic, but there's some kind of - fairly obvious - cause and effect that helps you come to terms with it. Satoru Iwata passed because his cancer returned. Prince passed due to a lethal combination of illness and opiods. Anthony Bourdain passed after... sharing photos of him and his daughter at BJJ practice and recording another episode for his show in France? ",

About 6 months ago I started opening up to my lady and that\u2019s what helped me move on and realize that things are good.. it took a few months to talk everything out but she was super supportive and I feel awesome.  Things are insanely better now that I had a change of attitude.   Hell, I\u2019m getting married in January.      Ur a nice person to say such nice things.   Hope the world treats u well for the rest of ur days friend\n\nEdit:   I often say to myself that this would not have been as bad, if when I noticed those dark thoughts, I went and spoke to a pro.  What was 6 months of agony, and shame that I felt this way would have been not as bad.   I stress that I should have talked to a pro, cause even friends with the best intentions may not know the best way to speak with someone dealing with this stuff.  They may even be counterproductive.   If u feel like I did I cannot say this enough: TALK TO A PRO.   My life would have been significantly better if I took this advice last June when this started happening ",

It was a random thing, I was having a coffee on lunch and for wutever reason my mind drifted towards how I was acting and what the end result would be.   I felt so ashamed.  I jus broke down.  I remeber looking over my life insurance policy to make sure my lady would get paid out of I died in a car accident. God it was awful.   But even in the darkest depths you dig for urself jus look up and u will see even jus a pin prick of light.  I realized I could end it all and destroy my family, or I could use this pain to galvanize me to be the man I always wanted to be.  What u think becomes what u say, what u say becomes what u do, and what u do becomes the person you are.   That\u2019s y I was soo shitty, I kept telling myself I was soo shitty.  I got back into diet and exercise.  During my depression I was offered two promotions but turned them down cause I couldn\u2019t deal with any more stress, but after my epiphany I started taking work seriously again, fought tooth and nail for the promotions I turned down, got it, tuned down my drinking to only a few with friends, and by February I felt good enough to open up to the misses.  It was so hard to talk to her about it.  As a guy, especially the kind I am, it\u2019s tough to talk about those things.  I didn\u2019t wanna burden her with my stupidity.  But after I did I realized that in a relationship it\u2019s not jus being there for her, she\u2019s there for me too. A lot of crying ensued, but my god was it a weight off my chest.   I still say that if u feel the way I did, please go talk to someone.   It didn\u2019t have to go on so long if I jus went to a doctor when I first noticed it.  I was just so ashamed.  Do me a solid and go talk to someone.   It will get better",

One of the most, just pure-fun episodes.\n\nThe Congo, the season 1 finale. You could tell he wanted to do that forever, and especially recreate the whole Heart of Darkness river trip. It really set the tone that this tv show wasn't going to be as happy-go-lucky all the time and you could tell he poured his heart into writing the narration.\n\nNew Mexico. An underrated state I often don't think about he made seem absolutely fascinating and just an interesting as his harder-to-get-to, overseas destinations. Really made me realize I don't have to be going deep into, say, the jungles of Borneo to appreciate travel and broaden my experiences. NM is awesome by the way. Great food, great craft beer scene, great rock climbing.\n\nVietnam (both episodes). You can tell he really loves this location, maybe a bit more than others. And it really comes through when he visits.\n\nJust as an aside, I love how there's no consensus in the answers. Everyone takes something different from his shows.",

I wanted to hear some of my favorites played over wide shots of the Puget Sound. I wanted to smoke weed legally, listening to his songs.

Parts Unknown is great in it's own right but NoRes was so fresh and raw for the time it's really the show that first captivated me into loving Anthony Bourdain. Netflix eventually shorted NoRes to just a few handpicked episodes from each season and now I dont even think it's own anymore. \nBring it back please.",

There are people on suicide watches in prisons that find ways to kill themselves. \n\nI'm not claiming to know at all what Bourdain was doing. Hell, we don't even know if this was clinical depression or maybe he had gotten some bad news and this was situational depression. Or who knows what. We don't know if he struggled for years or if he had, in one single moment of weakness, the urge and ability to kill himself.\n\nIt really only takes a moment. Hell, some of the people who have survived jumping off bridges in suicide attempts say that once they left that bridge they regretted attempting suicide. But at that point, you're in luck's hands. It only takes a moment.\n\nWould you be scolding Boudain in the same way if he had died of cancer? That he shouldn't have eaten carcinogenic foods? Drank alcohol at all in his life? That he should have tried more experimental treatments? That he shouldn't have lived in a city with higher pollution rates than than countryside? Why do we reserve this judgment only for those who die from suicide?\n\n",

He was in no uncertain terms a flawed individual, and he was the first one to admit it. But he did a ton of good throughout his life and career.\n\nHe inspired me to take another look at the restaurant industry in general and garner a lot more respect for everyone involved. I think that could be said for anyone who read kitchen confidential.\n\nSaying he just ate food and talked about it is pretty reductive. One of his bigger points is that one of the easiest ways to get to know other people, and historically is one of the major factors in bridging divides between cultures, which he attempted to do for decades with his shows.\n\nOn top of that, I think he really was a great man. He\u2019s battled his own personal demons very publicly showing everyone that it\u2019s possible to make it through the other side. He got himself into a position of power through hard-work, but never forgot about where he came from or the hard working people that couldn\u2019t get there. He shined a light on communities in need to the world; he spoke for those who couldn\u2019t speak for himself.\n",

I would recommend going hiking there in the summer. Most of the mountains have paths to follow and the scenery is even better from the top of a mountain! If you're feeling extreme though, go skiing there in the winter, easily my favourite thing to do, period.",

Especially ones that don't lean heavily onto the horror aspect.\n\nI love how they take time to talk about the troll biology and the methodology of hunting trolls. The way it's presented as something that's 100% real is right up my alley.\n\nIf you go into it expecting a horror, action, etc. movie then you'll be dissapointed for sure, but it's a wildlife mockumentary and I think it's a perfect combination of two very disparate genres.\n\nI think there are also a lot of people that are taking the movie more seriously than it takes itself. Sure they're acting as if this is all real, but they take time to laugh at how absurd it is on several occasions. \n\nBasically it's a fun, lighthearted monster movie. The people that like it like it because it's an excellent lighthearted monster movie, opposed to the many, many awful ones out there. It doesn't resort to gore, sex, or overplayed tropes and it has a great setting. I consider it one of the best among its genre, but you do have to have reasonable expectations going in. ",

Something much bigger productions failed to do (looking at you Cloverfield). Also it had some pretty nice, kinda childish fairy tail tones mixed with horror (powerlines that are actualy electric fences to keep the monsters in? Thats something right out of make believe). All in all a *cult diamond* for sure and a definite winner in its category. But that doesnt mean its Citizen Cane.   ",

A movie like LA Confidential is \u201cso fucking good\u201d because the cast is great, the writing is superb, and the overall quality of the film and experience is amazing. A movie like Trollhunter is \u201cso fucking good\u201d because they managed to make me super interested in a self serious movie about an old bearded Norwegian out hunting Trolls rendered with varying degrees of success and being followed by a couple galactically stupid young adults. Its a concept that has no business working as well as it does, let alone at all. ",

It just bugs me that they try to make the trolls out to be just natural creatures, with eating and breeding habits, and territories, and then oh yeah also they can smell Christians. The movie is filmed in such a way that it's almost like a nature documentary, and that one fairy tale aspect is just super jarring to me. But I guess that's not a valid criticism since I'm getting downvoted to hell. ",

I myself turned it on one rainy afternoon after flipping through channels and see a movie called Trollhunter.   \n\nIt's not an extravagant movie with lots of CG and movie star hot actors. It's found footage style and seems so damn realistic you would swear it was real.  \n\nAnd don't get me started about the Main Character.",

It's a low budget foreign found footage film where a bunch of college kids find trolls in the wilderness during a school trip.\n\nThis movie should **suck**.\n\nInstead, it's surprisingly funny and entertaining. I enjoyed it. It's not going to win an Oscar, I won't watch it again, but I would recommend it to a friend to watch when they have some time to kill.",

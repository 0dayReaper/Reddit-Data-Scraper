Once you view it as some delightful romp through the cheesiest ice puns and the most absurdity the 90s could muster, it becomes a fun bit of comedy. I like it better than batman forever, since forever tried and failed to be somewhat serious. Batman and Robin didn't try. Batman and Robin said fuck it and did what it wanted.",

That wasn't from the original show. The camera work was suitably amateur, but too zoomed in and cropped to follow what the hell was happening in many of the action scenes.  The movie is just so damn awful...",

When he was created in 1939, he was a grim, noirish figure, fighting crime with gadgets, grit, and guns. \n\nIn the 1960s, he became a campy character who was inconvenienced by the villains, rather than killed by them (this was of course because you couldn't show someone being murdered on TV). \n\nWhen the movies started coming out in the late 80s/early 90s, he was once again a grim guardian of the night, going toe-to-toe with maniacs and lunatics. In the animated TV series, he was an omniscient god - he knew things before the villains did them.\n\nThe two Schumacher are the mid 1990s condensed, melted, and poured into 125 minutes of neon, bad taste and actors who really shouldn't have had their names associated with it. To experience this movie is to *be* in 1997 America, when the Internet was still that thing you heard about on Friends and everyone was getting rich off of, you could still board an air plane without being bombarded by X-Rays, and everyone hoped for the future. \n\nSo sit back, relax and grab your Pepsi points, because it's time for a trip back in time.\n",

Before, when Netflix was just starting out, they were likely paying a lot to get the mainly popular shows on. These were also bundled with the shitty shows.\n\nNow, Netflix is making way more content (and money) so content creators are demanding more because they know Netflix *could* afford it, and they also have stake in Hulu and can always drop it there.\n\nThey aren't blameless, sure, in the sense that they could pony up more money than they were paying before for the same content.  Which is about as fair as a grocery store charging you, specifically, 100% more for everything because they peeked at your W2 and know you can afford it.\n\nAt the same time, I don't really blame the content creators. They're a business, they're in it to make money, and if they know they can put their content on \"their\" streaming service and make more money that putting on a competitor's service (thereby promoting that service over your own), why wouldn't they?\n\nIt sucks for the consumers who choose to only subscribe to Netflix, but that's they way of everything: you don't want one service to have everything, because then they can charge you anything and have no competition.",

In today\u2019s world of social media and celebrity, of cancel culture and doxxing, it shows how quickly our lives can fall apart in an instant.\n\nIt\u2019s so much more than its stars, its trailer, or the central conflict. Every episode reveals another layer about the characters, about society, about race, class, gender\u2026about pretty much everything.",

It was interesting watching two people demolish their lives, but if you came looking for the \"ha has\" it was a bit of a fake out.",

Maybe slightly similar vibe Atlanta without the dark comedy, not like Barry at all in my opinion. It's a drama done really well. There's some humor of course, the characters have likeable and dislikeable qualities, but ultimately it's just a really good, human story.",

Its not slapstick comedy, its more subtle, the humor is mostly based on irony, and this show is loaded with it.  \n\nSome of the jokes arent played out instantly, like when it shows how George asked for divorce, then twenty minutes later in a flashback, you see him getting advice from \"Zane\" that he should totally get a divorce, to which George responded, \"Really, that thought never crossed my mind.\"     \n\nI mean where do you even start with listing all the irony.  I mean the fact the two characters are actually so similar and would probably make for a fantastic couple.  Theres the fact that the instant Amy actually opened up and was totally honest, George wanted nothing to do with her -- and it wasnt the cheating that pushed him beyond, it was the realization of how terrible a person shes always been.\nThat lady getting chopped in half by the door to her safe room was ironic.\nIsaac just wanting to spend time with his cousins is ironic, since they end up ruining his life.  \nIt goes on and on.  Its not like cheap Family Guy type comedy, the jokes are more situational, but its much funnier to me anyhow",

I enjoyed it, but I liked the more straight forward storyline of Donald Glover's character and struggle of the first couple of seasons. I can't shit on the show for trying something different and more artsy/experimental even though it didn't always seem to land.",

Tone in terms of darkness/humor and characters, but they also both exhibit that classic black comedy trait of almost everything always happening at just the wrong time, or at the best worst place, or to the perfect wrong person, whether through pure coincidence, misunderstanding, *understanding*, etc. People get lucky just to be even more incredibly unlucky because of that later. If they're ignorant of some plot point, they'll become knowledgeable about it at the most consequential timing. \n\nA lot of the good black comedies off the top of my head exhibit this I think, Ice Harvest, Fargo (movie/series), Burn After Reading, In Bruges (I think? Can't quite remember the movie that well). I always thought this set black comedies apart from dark comedies, but maybe that's just a personal distinction in my head.\n\nI think Barry is the best and darkest out of those, but it has the most content (seasons) to draw from.",

He feels that a lot of these series' can be whittled down to a really solid 2 1/2 hour movie, and he felt Beef was a perfect example of that. It's padded out a LOT to reach 10 episodes. A longer movie would have moved at an breakneck pace, and been much more exciting. It would be an interesting fan experiment to edit it down to 2 hours or a bit longer. \n\nOn the other hand, part of the impact of the story is that they are two damaged people who keep encountering each other over a long period of time, and actually become friends, in a sick twisted way. By stretching it out, their \"friendship\" starts to make a little more sense.",

The hatred gives them something to live for.  I thought the show producers made that pretty obvious.  Its convincing to me too -- because whether you are successful \"monetarily\" or not, your life ends up being pretty empty if its all centered on making money.\n\nNotice how Isaac and Paul, one somewhat successful monetarily, the other very unsuccessful, are both major contrasts to the main characters, because they seem to be living much more fulfilling lives and dont measure themselves or their lives up by the careers/money.  Isaac is in heaven just hanging out with his cousin and chillin on a massage chair, Paul is in heaven soon as a girl gives him some attention.  And ironically, they both get their lives ruined by the main characters  and their emptiness.  Its pretty fucking funny, in a sadly ironic way.",

Succession is more a drama, with some dark comedy sprinkled in.  Wouldnt classify it as a comedy though at all.  And Atlanta stopped being funny halfway through the 2nd season.  It ended somewhere way south of mediocre.  \n\nPretty much, recently, there's been nothing in the good comedies.  Hell I havent even seen a decent stand up special in like 2 or 3 years.",

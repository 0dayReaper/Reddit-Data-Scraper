They are less threat to me than a coop of chickens are to you. My real struggle is with my own burnout, to have any kind of personal life whatsoever, because it\u2019s not the bad guys I stop that worry me, it\u2019s the ones I don\u2019t, because sometimes I need to relax and just fly around, or go to a movie, or even sit here and talk to you. And while I\u2019m doing that, bad guys are doing bad guy stuff. If you really want my powers, you can have them. With great responsibility comes great guilt for not living up to it.\u201d\n\nProbably not her, because she\u2019s together enough to manage her own guilt. Maybe Starlight from The Boys or Robin from Teen Titans might say that.",

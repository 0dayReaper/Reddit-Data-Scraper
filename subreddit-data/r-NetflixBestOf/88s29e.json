It had a decent cast but they were saying horrible lines. They had a decent budget, yet everything looks like a B movie. The general idea of the plot is decent, but the villains are laughable. They're supposed to be these badasses, but they're wearing moon boots and fake hands. They barely move let alone be intimidating. If you like bad movies it's worth a watch.",

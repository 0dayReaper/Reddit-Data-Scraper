    "postText": "**Do you think Nate was in the right to kick Alex out?**\n\nWhen the show came out, I noticed he got a lot of hateful criticism online, since he take Alex and Maddy in because he wanted something back. That may be true, and it was probably inconsiderate to force a relationship on her so fast with all that she was going through.\n\nBut I think his intentions were genuine. She said she needed space, he gave her space. If he was truly a selfish fucker, I think he would've kicked her out immediately after she rejected him a second time, and even taken back the car to be extra malicious.\n\nI know Alex went back and slept with Sean in a moment of weakness, but no matter how you slice it, it came to a point where she was taking advantage. Maddy is not Nate's responsibility. Yet here he is, watching and protecting her all night even though he has his own kid to worry about while the woman he likes is out fucking the abuser she tried to get away from. How can anyone in his position not see this as a kick in the teeth?\n\nI'm not trying to make Alex look like the bad guy, but it's pretty clear she took advantage from the get-go. She knew Nate had feelings for him, and she banked on it after losing that apartment. Even Sean was taking advantage of Nate. He knew where his daughter was, but when Alex was DTF, he seized the opportunity.\n\nAlex is by no means obligated to give herself to Nate. That part I can agree with. But at the same time, if she's gonna be doing this back-and-forth shit with Sean, why should Nate continue to get himself in the middle of this? Is it really right for Alex to continually take up Nate's hospitality, knowing the guy has feelings for her?",

She was really struggling at the time and she needed to heal from that. Nate isn\u2019t a bad guy nor is Alex. It was just a bad situation that Alex was in from being with Sean",

            "comment": "I think it comes down to this: Would Nate have helped Alex out if he knew from that start that he would never have an intimate relationship with her?\n\nIf not, than his help was transactional. It wasn\u2019t just freely given because he cared about her. He cared about her AND he wanted to have a relationship with her. \n\nGiven the massive power imbalance between them, and the fact that Alex was trying to recover from an abusive relationship, I personally don\u2019t think it is morally okay to help Alex with those unspoken terms. \n\nNate\u2019s loyalty and assistance was predicated on the hope that he\u2019d be the new man in Alex\u2019s life. He couldn\u2019t handle the fact that this wasn\u2019t going to be the case, so he kicked her out. He wanted to be with her more than he wanted to help her and the kid.\n\nI don\u2019t think this makes him an awful person, but it doesn\u2019t make him a good one either.",

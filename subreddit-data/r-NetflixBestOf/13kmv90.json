I'll definitely have to do some more research before deciding if I want to watch it. As for the accuracy of the plot, it's always a slippery slope with dramatizations of real events. It's important to take those kinds of things with a grain of salt and do our own research to get a full understanding of what really happened.",

Two Norwegian Child Welfare Services employees visit them regularly before taking Shubha and Shuchi during the last visit. The Chatterjees are told that they are unfit to hold custody of their children, so Debika decides to sue the government and win back custody of her children .",

She ran a cyber security business and sure seemed like a \u201cgirl boss \u201c to me, The president was a woman. The top corrupt White House aid was ruthless but did well and a big part of the show. CIA agent that protected Maddy was kickass. The characters were well balanced for male and female and it went into their characters",

I\u2019ve seen too many shows where the story or plot seemed unique and so original. But I couldn\u2019t get into because of the characters, the dialogue, and it was too complicated where you\u2019re constantly having to remember so much or watch every second of the show. There are plenty of shows that overthink or over complicate the mysteries or clues to be solved. There was enough where I had to follow but I didn\u2019t have to stay glued, Could quickly check my phone, something big happens, it gets me pulled in the suspense action again. Oh well",

But I completly forgot about the walkie-talkies.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n&gt; An extended version of the film, including altered special effects, was released on March 22, 2002. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as he did not have enough time to perfect the animatronics. Computer-generated imagery (CGI), provided by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered to include more lights. Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with walkie-talkies. ",

In terms of hype and excitement, it was our version of the Harry Potter movies, and *everyone* saw it (well, I didn't for a year or so, actually, but that's a different story). \n\nAs I remember it, however, the biggest thing about it was that the studio (or someone) refused to release E.T. on videotape for many years ([six, according to this article](http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-10-27/lifestyle/0080040044_1_video-film-movie)). I gather this was a big P.R. ploy, but I remember wondering why all the other movies I wanted to see came out so quickly, but E.T. took forever.\n\nSo, being able to watch this on Netflix is a bit nostalgic for me, mainly because it seemed so hard to just be able to watch when I was a kid.

Only Star Wars had more cultural impact.  I remember my local movie theater re-releasing the film for a limited engagement a YEAR after it's original release and it totally sold out.  It was the number one movie for 17 WEEKS in 1982.  It grossed $359 million in 1982 dollars.  This was at a time when Jaws, only 7 years before, was the first film to ever cross $100 million domestically.  To call it a cultural phenomenon would be an understatement.",

Unless you caught the movie in the theater when it came out, you were shit out of luck for *years*.  Buying movies on tape was a big deal back then.  When it was finally released, you could buy copies of it *fucking everywhere*.  Even grocery stores would have huge displays with a ton of copies of the movie.\n\nShit, considering that E.T. the video game caused the video game market to crash it's a goddamn wonder that the release of it on VHS didn't cause the VHS market to crash (joking, obviously, but it's kind of a funny parallel).\n\nGood god, I'm 40 years old and I'm telling old man stories.  This is what it's come to, Reddit.  I'm officially old.",

The alien is found by a 10 year old boy, Elliot. Soon the two begin to communicate, and start a different kind of friendship in which E.T learns about life on earth and Elliot learns about some new values for the true meaning of friendship. E.T. wants to go home, but if Elliot helps him, he'll lose a friend...\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n&gt; The film received universal acclaim. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and wrote, \"This is not simply a good movie. It is one of those movies that brush away our cautions and win our hearts.\" He later added it to his Great Movies list, structuring the essay as a letter to his grandchildren about the first time they watched it. Michael Sragow of Rolling Stone called Spielberg \"a space age Jean Renoir.... \\[F\\]or the first time, \\[he\\] has put his breathtaking technical skills at the service of his deepest feelings\". Derek Malcolm of The Guardian wrote that \"E.T. is a superlative piece of popular cinema ... a dream of childhood, brilliantly orchestrated to involve not only children but anyone able to remember being one\". Leonard Maltin would include it in his list of \"100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century\" as one of only two movies from the 1980s. George Will was one of the few to pan the film, feeling it spread subversive notions about childhood and science.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?E.T.+the+Extra-Terrestrial+%281982%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=E.T.%20the%20Extra-Terrestrial), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/et_the_extraterrestrial/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/et-the-extra-terrestrial), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/60024058), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11621).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F5624ev \"Confidence: 1.09\").

One of the gifts was a collection of cartoon memories with captions. One panel had two guys with fireworks going off while they each enjoyed a beverage. The caption read:\n\n\"I don't know who this Gay Fox is, but he sure throws a heck of a party\"",

This mask is not just a pleasant looking cover to hide that which lies beneath, it is the last remaining trace of the voice of the people, which has disappeared and now no longer exists. However, this courageous arrival of a past irritation stands reborn and inspired and has sworn to conquer and crush these bribe-taking, corrupted, poisonous vermin who are at the forefront of promoting evil and greed, by allowing the use violence to remove the free will of the people.\nThe only solution to this problem is retaliation. A personal revenge that I have vowed to carry through with, which can I add is not for my own fulfilment, because the meaningfulness and truthfulness of my actions will one day become clear to the watchful and honest people.\nAdmittedly, this concoction of complicated words has now become a bit excessive and long-winded, so let me simply finish by saying that I am honoured to meet you, and you may call me V.\"\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/yf3hs/i_translated_the_v_speech_from_v_for_vendetta/",

The film fairly clearly makes V the hero, a man of vision who is inspiring people to rise up against evil. In the book, it's a lot less clear if he has good intentions or just a revenge-obsessed terrorist. They both have unique storytelling strengths.",

The novel was about a clash between the two extremes of politics - anarchism and fascism. The Wachowskis ignored his ideas and warped the film into a fight between American liberalism and neoconservativism. While that may have been relevant to the contemporary events of the time, it was nonetheless a complete rewriting of the subtext of the book. Likewise, it has only further discouraged Alan Moore from ever licensing the rest of his work for film adaptation, making it so that the art of film will likely be forever deprived of various works that have high potential for a great adaptation.\n\nAnd for those who will say \"Moore is never happy with anything,\" that is a baseless claim given by people who handwave away his arguments as \"grumpy old man who doesn't get comics and needs to get back to writing the best comics ever.\" He actually liked the adaptation of *For the Man Who Has Everything*, because that was the one actual faithful adaptation of his work. (He is reportedly also pleased with *Saturday Morning Watchmen* and the parody of him on *The Simpsons*.) His problem is that *nothing else* of his is ever faithfully adapted and gets changed so much that they no longer reflect the original material.",

Alan Moore is a wonderful writer of comics, one of the best ever, but he is naive if he ever thought that Hollywood would create faithful adaptations. That's just not how the game works. Ask any writer ever whose work has been optioned. If he is so disgusted by the adaptations, then he shouldn't license his work to be adapted. To allow your work to be adapted and then to complain about every single one means that he has not learned his lesson on the machinations of Hollywood. Not to mention that, as pure as he claims to be, he is still collecting a fat paycheck. That's the trade-off. You want your work to be propagated to the masses through movies and TV? Then as soon as you sign on the line that is dotted, you essentially give up your right to object to what they do with it.  If Alan Moore still doesn't understand this, then I don't know what to tell him.",

DC owns the DC Universe ones (*For the Man* *Who Has Everything*, *The Killing Joke, Swamp Thing, Constantine*), and made a shifty deal with him for the others (*Watchmen*, *V*) so they can perpetually own them. (Basically, his contract says that they own the two stories until they stop publishing them, which back in the 80s would have meant \"by the end of the year or so,\" but shifted to \"never\" when they realized how valuable they are.)\n* The ones he owns that got adapted were licensed at a time when he wasn't aware of how Hollywood works, and thus he was too late to stop those from being made. This is actually a common problem for many writers, and was more common prior to the 21st century.\n* As I said before, he does not license anything anymore, *at all*, due to his early experiences. All new adaptations of his work are the DC owned ones, which he has no legal say in.\n* He doesn't collect jack. His two creator-owned films bombed, and DC doesn't care about him (and also their films failed or nearly failed).\n\nSo no, he didn't \"sign on the line that is dotted.\" He didn't even get coffee, Blake.",

    "postText": "\nNo one asked for this but it\u2019s 5 AM and I just finished binge watching the show so here goes nothing\u2026. \n\nLet me know if I should tag this as spoiler. I try to make it as vague as possible and cover up the few spoilers that I give.\n\n\nDisclaimer: Before I start off, I don\u2019t want any Floridians coming at me about location or this and that wouldn\u2019t happen in Florida. It\u2019s a tv show for Pete\u2019s sake, nothing in shows is supposed to be 100% real. \n\nI will start off by saying that the movie name Florida man is kind of some sort of satire to signify, and in a sense ridicule the crazy things that happened in Florida. For example, shark attacks, snake attacks, alligator attacks, being allowed to have a gun, police corruption (which isn\u2019t something that happens only in Florida but they try to make it seem like they were the only corrupt state), drugs and arms, being smuggled, etc.\n\nMoreover, you have to keep in mind that the first part of the show takes place in \u201cPhiladelphia\u201c. So the majority of the actors with the exclusion of Mike, the main character, who has an extremely annoying accent, that unfortunately does not get discussed. But to my surprise, a scene was removed which explicitly explains that Mike\u2019s father met his mother in Venezuela and that\u2019s where he was born and that\u2019s where he grew up and that\u2019s why he has this thick accent as an adult. Why did they remove this scene? It would\u2019ve saved countless times of me wondering where the hell did this guy\u2019s accent come from when his dad is white and his sister who is that more fair skinned has a perfect American accent. \n\nThe show starts off a little slow, but it\u2019s still keeps it exciting with Moss the quirky gang leader who inherited everything due to his father\u2019s death, and then Mike being the gambler who is pretty much Moss\u2019  go to person for everything, but in this case, he is just Moss\u2019 driver due to the fact that Mike racked up an immense amount debt due to his gambling addiction. \n\nDelly sneaks out and drives to Florida and Moss has instructed Mike, his driver to go get her for him. The problem being, Delly doesn\u2019t want to be found. I do want to commend the directors for adding so much creativity you can tell that this was a very well thought out show. &gt;!Dolly\u2019s death!&lt;\n\nI would say the show keeps you on your toes and it kind of makes you sympathize and grow to like Mike. \n\nDelly, Moss\u2019 girlfriend is also someone who you grow to love in this series due to her difficult past, and you get to find out why she gets involved with Moss in the first place, which is very interesting. It makes you turn your point of view of just thinking she\u2019s some bimbo, to wow everything that this woman has done has been precisely coordinated and calculated, and you kind of start to respect her as well.\n\nIris, is kind of a pain in the butt in the beginning, but she does play a important part towards the end of the series. Honestly, I found her pretty annoying from beginning to end. She was just kind of a mood killer.\n\nMoss, we don\u2019t really get to see much of him, except for phone calls, but when he does get involved in the series towards the end, he\u2019s pretty funny to be honest I did find myself laughing at a lot of things that he says, and does, and I love  the mockery of like the gangsters- kind of hits home. I\u2019m from a small town NEXT to Lynn, MA (look it up, they call it, Lynn Lynn the city of sin, the way you get in isn\u2019t the way you get out.) \n\n\nDanny, he is a bad ass and that sometimes I get a little bit annoyed with Mike because he gives his dad such a hard time but in the end, he really does pull through even though it\u2019s the ending did leave me asking a lot of questions. \n\n&gt;!Like how did the gold get on the boat? How did Delly find out about the gold on the boat as well? It kind of makes you wonder was Danny trying to runoff with Delly?!&lt;\n\nAll in all, if you\u2019re looking for a show that is about adventure, comedy, crime, and a little bit of a love story than I totally recommend the show to anyone looking for a well-rounded show in my opinion.",

Especially since it felt  it took too long to get there",

You would have to assume their mother was Hispanic then and that is where the accent came from given the father's absence in their lives. But yeah, it seems inconsistent.",

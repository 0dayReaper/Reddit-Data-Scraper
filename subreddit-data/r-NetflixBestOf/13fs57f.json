It\u2019s immature, petty, childish stuff that I feel is sort of prevalent amongst that overly educated, Ivy League culture. It imparts this level of social superiority on people like this, those who get together and discuss their favourite authors and the merits of literary fiction. Their lives are so different and out of touch with 98% of America, but act like their petty concerns are a matter of life and death. But I see your point, at times I do feel they tried too hard to play up that archetype.",

Despite their educated, it's hilarious how asinine and childish they behave, like how they play tennis, or how loud and obnoxious they are together.\n\nThe main cast was phenomenal, as they all were silly and goofy, but there's an overall sense of despair and sadness that fills their lives. \n\nThey had an amazing list of background characters, such as Kate McKinnon, or Seth Rogan, that would drop in for one episode and blow their scenes away.\n\nIt's also a great looking series, think of when they go wine tasting on Long Island, or the energy of the wedding they attend.\n\nAh... I could go on and on, but I really don't know anyone that likes this show!",

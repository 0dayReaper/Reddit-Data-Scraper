It's just like the scene with Margot Robbie explaining CDO's.  Would it be cool for Margot Robbie to show up in your bubble bath?  Yeah!  In fact, it would be too good to be true, just like CDO'S.  \n\nHere's how credit default swaps work.  Let's say you have money, and you want to lend that money out in exchange for monthly payments of x% of that debt plus a certain amount of interest.  Now, every major religion has rules against usury, but we're a godless heathen society, so whatcha gonna do. \n\nSo, some schmuck comes looking for a loan, you lend it, business happens,  bada boom bada bing.  Everybody goes home happy.\n\nBut wait!  Some other guy comes to you with a deal.  He's got this invention called a credit default swap.  He's gonna bet you that this guy who you just leant a bunch of money to won't pay.  \n\nNow, you've done your homework on this guy who you just loaned money to.  He's rated triple A.  In fact, he's part of a whole group of guys that are rated AAA.  That's all you need to see to give him a loan.  And since that guy was rated AAA, this other guy, who thinks the first guy is gonna default, must be off his rocker.  But he's willing to give you money every month on this bet.  So, now you have an opportunity to get the debt, to get the interest AND make the bet money every month.\n\nOf course you're gonna take that bet.  You're in the business of making money.  \n\nOf course, the downside to that bet is that you have to pay up if the debtor actually does default.  But he's rated AAA, so you're golden. \n\nBut the downside to that AAA rating is that there are a couple different ratings agencies, and you're paying them to rate certain sketchy individuals highly so that you can make more loans that look good.  But it's okay, because it's only one guy.\n\nExcept it's not only one guy.  In fact, it's a significant portion of the people who you've loaned money to over the past decade.  But it's okay, because you've got money. \n\nBut, it turns out you've made these kind of bets alot.  In fact, the amount of money that you would owe on credit default swaps is more money than you have.  But it's okay, because surely not everyone is gonna default at once, right?\n\n\nExcept that's exactly what happened.  The guys who were rated AAA shouldn't have been.  The ratings agencies fraudulently rated them high, because you were paying them to.  You were telling them to do that you could make these loans with the appearance of propriety that wasn't really there.  Then, you made these side bets.  When the debts all came due, there was NO money, so you had to pull from your reserves in order to pay your own debts.  \n\nAnd that was the exact moment that everyone realized the game was rigged.  Your investors pulled out, taking their own money.  Then, you had no money, more debt than you could pay and boom, belly up.\n",

Spotlight was straight-forward and kept the focus on the story rather than characters, letting the weight of the scandal fall on the viewer. The Big Short knew that its story and financial drama isn't that interesting, so it entertained you with its bizarre characters and used many other forms of story-telling to relay the drama to the viewer. These 2 were my favorites for Best Picture by a wide margin, probably the best year in film since 2010 (The Social Network, Inception)",

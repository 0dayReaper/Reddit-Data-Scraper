Maybe I will give it another go. Mr. Queen is now on the top of my list!",

Neither of these have fantasy elements per say but they both make me feel warm inside :)  Crash Landing on You is also real good but can have some more serious moments compared to the other two recommendations. If you want kdrama with more fantasy you could check out Hotel del Luna, also liked that one.",

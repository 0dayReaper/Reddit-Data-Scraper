It was the best thing that could have happened without it being unbelievable. She didn\u2019t go off to take the bar exam and become partner at a Manhattan law firm. That would have been silly. She opened a diner where she got the building at no charge because she was friends with owners. And she saw her son again which was the one thing she wanted in the whole world. Ah that was beautiful. !&lt;",

            "comment": "Just posted on another post, that was much older.  \n\n\nI have a Leslie in my life, as a mother. I was dreading the ending. I knew if they made it sad, I\u2019d be pissed at them, and if they made it happy, I\u2019d be pissed at them.  \n\n\nSad would be easy in my opinion. The happy ending made me cry like a baby, the sad would have probably made me sit stoically. We all know how sad endings go for the Leslies of the world, we\u2019ve all seen it. Anyone who has someone like Leslie in their life has so many absolutely delusions fictional Happy Endings that they\u2019ve hoped for. My mom, for instance, always talked about a yellow house with lace curtains. The diner with a homemade pie was equally wholesome and cheesy. I think the happy ending was the most heartbreaking decision they could have made, as those like me that watch it are both so invested in it wrapping up in a way that it never could have been, and also so upset that stories like this just can\u2019t happen in reality.   \n\n\nThe actress was amazing. The early scenes between her and her son were almost exactly true to life. The depiction of Texas was almost spot on, except they didn\u2019t have any Lone Star Beer signs in the bar. A very good movie that I honestly should not have watched.",

The types of series i\u2019ve realised i like is ones like outer banks, 13 reasons why and ginny and georgia. Typically the type of series about teenagers which are intense but do not drift too much into fantasy. \n\nHowever a different type of series i have found interesting are like You, Breaking Bad and The Boys. Apart from Better Call Saul, would you have any suggestions?",

            "comment": "I feel like everybody is missing the type of show you\u2019re talking about! It sounds like your looking for teen dramas and this is basically my niche so I have a fuckton of suggestions for you. \n\nMost of the shows you list are relatively current, I would recommend going back to the golden years of 2010 teen dramas (bonus being they\u2019re all finished too). A lot of the times they\u2019ll fall off 2-3 seasons in, but all of the shows I\u2019m listing have great/memorable premier seasons and will give you hours of drama and entertainment:\n\n*Gossip Girl*\n\n*The OC*\u2014pretty much the blueprint for Outerbanks\n\n*Vampire Diaries*\n\n*Friday Night Lights*\u2014this sounds most likely to be up your alley imo\n\n*Glee*\u2014okay before I lose all credibility, seasons 1 and 2 are genuinely hilarious and full of drama give it a shot\n\n*Freaks and Geeks*\n\n*Veronica Mars*\n\n*Teen Wolf*\n\n*Gilmore Girls*\n\n**And some more current shows in the same category:**\n\n*School Spirits*\n\n*Elite*\n\n*Riverdale*\u20141st season is genuinely awesome, but definitely jumps the shark soon after that\n\n*Heartbreak High*\n\n*Yellowjackets*\n\n*Cruel Summer*\u2014criminally underrated\n\n\n**Other shows you would probably like that aren\u2019t teen dramas:**\n\n\n*How to get away with murder*\n\n*Grey\u2019s Anatomy*\n\n*Dexter*\n\n*Lost*\n\n*Prison Break*\n\n*Supernatural*\n\n*Scandal*\n\n*The Recruit*\n\n\nA lot of these shows you might have heard of or have preconceived notions about, but they\u2019re well known for a reason and I would say go in with an open mind. A lot of them can be a little bit corny sometimes (and even moreso as the seasons progress), but if you can just sit back, suspend disbelief, and let yourself be entertained by some over the top drama, this is some of the best stuff you can watch.",

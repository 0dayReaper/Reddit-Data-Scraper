I bought this movie on Amazon Prime video for my other son and I dont regret a damn thing!.  It came with the dvd extras and watching the work they put into it is just amazing!\n\nPs. If you want an extra little tear, in the credits they talk about how the kid who played Miguel was just a stand in.  Well after a while or for his birthday or something they brought him a cake and he opened the box and it said \"you got the part.\"  Wholesome as fuck.",

I'm not totally dissociated with my Mexican heritage, but sometimes I do wish I participated in the cultures more. But America has it's own culture too which is great. America has rock and roll, rap, trap, hamburgers, hot dogs, amazing films and television, YouTubers, and a bunch of other stuff I can't think of right now. Both cultures are great and Coco is a beautiful product of both those cultures, which we should celebrate :) ",

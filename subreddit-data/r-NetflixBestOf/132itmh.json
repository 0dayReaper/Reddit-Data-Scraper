Each episode has a lot going on and there seems to be a never ending supply of catch 22s (or is it catches 22?).\n\nI also love that the show is a mix of Flemish, Yiddish, English and French. As a native German speaker who speaks English and spoke French it\u2018s very fascinating to understand parts of the Flemish and Yiddish but subtitles are a must for this show.",

Unfortunately since NAD is not a Supreme Court decision, it leaves room for interpretation.

There is a lot happening and sometimes the script sort of gets its wires crossed, but they managed to finish pretty strong.  I like being immersed in the micro-culture of Antwerp's Ultra Orthodox Jewish community.  I did think it was key to include the \"bridge\" character of Noah.  The prodigal son returned!  It's an age old story but hey, tropes work sometimes.\n\nI would recommend to anyone with the option of watching with subtitles to do that instead of watching a dubbed version.  I speak English and a little French.  I also understand some Yiddish words, but not nearly enough to be able to follow the conversations.  Dubbed voice just don't convey the meaning and emotion as well as the originals do, IMO.  Unless you happen to be proficient in Flemish and at least one of the other three languages included (or if you are visually impaired), you will probably have a better viewing experience with sub-titles.\n\nI did kind of giggle at a few of Noah's \"Tough Guy\" moments.  I felt like I was watching Jewish Belgian Ray Donovan.  But overall, well done.",

It's only a couple times early on and never happens again (maybe once).  It's almost like they fired the people who wrote the first 2 episodes.\n\nBut, yeah, I love your phrase \"micro-culture\".  Watching Shtisel made me search for Orthodox TV shows. I nenver knew there was such a thing!  I really like Commandments for instance.  Seeing a standard plotline played out in a micro-culture is fascinating",

Without getting into spoilers, some of the stuff the prosecutor (Smets) and Noah do in the last few episodes makes no sense.

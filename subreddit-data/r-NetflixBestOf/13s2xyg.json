That's basically the deal.\n\n Coincidentally, I watched it right after a rewatch of Breaking Bad and there are a lot of parallels. A man who's a genius at his (legal) profession turns their skills to crime and has to balance their criminal activity and keeping their family together and safe from a scary Mexican cartel leader. Breaking Bad is smarter and more surprising and just better, but Ozark is still good and worth watching. Anyone who thinks they're anywhere near equal just isn't that discerning, but it is still good.",

I only had 4 episodes left and that\u2019s when I realized I could not care less about the fates of any of the characters, so I stopped watching.

You will love Marty and especially Ruth!! Ruth is one of the best characters ever! \n\nAs the show progresses, you'll come to hate Marty's wife, Wendy - but you're supposed to!

From start to finish, the stakes are very, very high, and the tension never lets up. \n\nAnother GREAT series of that style, and very underrated, is The Americans, which is on Hulu. I think Breaking Bad is #1, but The Americans might be #2.",

Like almost everything out these days it could have been a season shorter overall. If you like Breaking Bad or Fargo season 1 you will like this. Added note - Fargo season 1 may  be the best single season in tV history.",

Shit is believable to a good degree and acting. All the characters are pretty fleshed out. The acting is good. Story has me tuned in. \n\nAnywho, back to the series.

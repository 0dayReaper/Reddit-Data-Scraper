I remember watching it in Highschool or maybe college but either way im 35 now lol. So it was def along time ago\n\n**EDIT** I was right and wrong lol. They actually shot Planet Earth I in 4K, but released it as a 1080p program because 4K players and TVs were not out when Planet Earth I had its debut bc it was so long ago. Im surprised they had 4k technology back then.",

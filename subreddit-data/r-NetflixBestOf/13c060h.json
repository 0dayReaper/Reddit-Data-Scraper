Therefore, if you would like to share your opinions about the nonlinear storytelling approach used in Kaleidoscope, I was wondering you could complete my **survey**; which takes around **3 minutes**! **No personal information** will be asked and the survey is of course **anonymous**. Please find the link attached below. :))\n\nThank you so much in advance.\n\n[https://nl.surveymonkey.com/r/9Q8BHDS](https://nl.surveymonkey.com/r/9Q8BHDS)",

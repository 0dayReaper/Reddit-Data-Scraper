There are some good Spotify playlists with the soundtrack.   \n  \nedit:[ here is the season 2 soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/user/caliluvsart/playlist/1kan3BlJUE72RvW9QoLfVh), my favorite. Personal fave songs are by Shura and Michael Kiwunika. Couldn't find a playlist with every season combined, but if you search \"scrotal recall\" on spotify you will find it. ",

Heart break between lily and Marshall, heartbreak with Marshall\u2019s dad, tears of joy with Barney and Robin? That show is fantastic. So many great running gags. The only bad part is the ending. \n\nEdit: as for sound tracks there are many great hits in this series including [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=i-OGD2DgIHI) \n\nDownvotes. Sick. Forgot about the reddit circle jerk ",

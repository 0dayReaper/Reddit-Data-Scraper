(I couldn't possibly notice this back in those days because the first commercially successful smartphone with a roughly similar design came out around 2007. When I later re-watched the movie, I suspected that they put those smartphones into people's hands via CGI at a later date, possibly for the Blu-Ray release. But I didn't find evidence one way or another.) And it touches on both computer simulation and genetic engineering (and, of course, their subtlely implied intertwining with psychedelic drugs, just like The Matrix).  \nI think eXistenZ is a masterpiece of its time and genres. Too bad The Matrix overshadowed it so much. It could be a \"cult classic\" otherwise.",

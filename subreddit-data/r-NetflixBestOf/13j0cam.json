He should def get awards. \n\nIt is absolutely mind blowing how the police just disregarded the many attempts of the citizens reporting him. \n\nI also work with someone who went to school &amp; was classmates with the guy who attacked and killed dahmer. She said they all celebrated it when it happened.",

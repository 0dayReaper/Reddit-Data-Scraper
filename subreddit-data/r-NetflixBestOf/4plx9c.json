And now, 20 years later, is what? The world's biggest leper colony. Why? Godlessness. Let me say that again... Godlessness. It wasn't the war they started. It wasn't the plague they created. It was Judgement. No one escapes their past. No one escapes Judgement. You think he's not up there? You think he's not watching over this country? How else can you explain it?

What's really, vitally important in the book is the fact that Norsefire was legally and willingly put into power by the British citizens. A major theme of the book is how people willingly sacrifice their personal freedoms and the freedoms of others for security and safety. \n\nV is a much more complicated figure in the book because he's trying to destroy a government that the majority of people in Britain want to be in power. Films practically always require some sort of simplification when it comes to narrative and characterization, but V for Vendetta either completely misunderstands the source material or willfully changes it to be more relevant to post-9/11 America.",

In my experience most people just have no idea what fascism is. This hyper-nationalism we're experiencing is what directly lead to the nazi party. \n\nAnd I know it's so typical for the Internet to cry nazi, but I dare you to actually do some research on the topic.\n\nObviously I'm not saying modern Britain is like Nazi Germany. What I am saying is that it's scary we're this close at all, after so little time. \n\nAlso, calling people you disagree with 'retards' isn't exactly the best way to make them see your point of view.",

So now the people with the same power are exercising it through channels which are not in CHECK, while everyone continues to tilt at the windmills of Government when things go wrong.  \n\nIronically in the case of Brexit and the Trump movement, people who are rightfully angry at the way they've been treated have been convinced to rally together and fight to give more wealth and power to the people who did it to them.",

Saved from a life-and-death situation by a man in a Guy Fawkes mask who calls himself V, she learns a general summary of V's past and, after a time, decides to help him bring down those who committed the atrocities that led to Britain being in the shape that it is in.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n&gt; Ebert and Roeper gave the film a \"two thumbs up\" rating. Roger Ebert stated that V for Vendetta \"almost always has something going on that is actually interesting, inviting us to decode the character and plot and apply the message where we will\". Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from At the Movies stated that despite the problem of never seeing Weaving's face, there was good acting and an interesting plot, adding that the film is also disturbing, with scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Jonathan Ross from the BBC blasted the film, calling it a \"woeful, depressing failure\" and stating that the \"cast of notable and familiar talents such as John Hurt and Stephen Rea stand little chance amid the wreckage of the Wachowski siblings' dismal script and its particularly poor dialogue.\" Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly gave the film a 'D', criticizing the film's treatment of its political message as being \"fairly dim, adolescent stuff,\" as well as expressing dislike for the \"barely decorated sets with television-standard overlit shadow-free cinematography by the late Adrian Biddle. The film is a visual insult.\" On Alan Moore removing his name from the project, Burns says \"it's not hard to see why,\" as well as criticising Portman's performance\\: \"Portman still seems to believe that standing around with your mouth hanging open constitutes a performance.\" Harry Guerin from the Irish TV network RT\u00c9 states the film \"works as a political thriller, adventure and social commentary and it deserves to be seen by audiences who would otherwise avoid any\\/all of the three\". He added that the film will become \"a cult favourite whose reputation will only be enhanced with age.\" Andy Jacobs for the BBC gave the film two stars out of five, remarking that it is \"a bit of a mess... it rarely thrills or engages as a story.\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?V+for+Vendetta+%282005%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=V%20for%20Vendetta%20%28film%29), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/v_for_vendetta/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/v-for-vendetta), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70039175), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5890).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4plx9c \"Confidence: 1.12\").

This would never happen..\" or \"you guys are so idealistic and always lean toward this cheap propaganda.\" However, when you crack open a history book or watch a history doc you can see how this very thing has happened before. I mean its not like Alan Moore created it to be so fantastical it wouldnt or couldn't happen. He created it because it *has* happened. Of course everyone is entitled to their opinion i just think that it's easy to shit on this movie than to confront the facts that this could actually happen in our lifetime (for some folks, again) so its easy to shrug it off as lame or *being so deep /s.*\n\nWhat's so fucken wrong in thinking that this movie is a political statement on extreme fascism and fanatical nationalism? Or how the government can conspire with the media and begin feeding its citizen lies for global and economic power? Is it bad to think that people can realize they outnumber those in power and that their COLLECTIVE voice can be heard and make a difference? I'm not trying to argue, I just think that this movie gets hate for the wrong reasons (if any). If you strip the hate, and see it for what it is (writing, score, cinematography etc.,) you'd see a classic. ",

In the sense that said work was [edit: in any way novel] in terms of its thematic content or storyline? Not really. It's pretty well hashed out grounds (one pinch Count of Monte Criste, a jigger full of 1984, a touch of Clockwork Orange, etc). There's really nothing here that hasn't been seen before.\n\nNow let's look at it as just a film. The writing is not great (the dialogue is particularly mediocre), the acting is not great (with Portman at almost Attack of the Clones level bad), the cinematography is a mixed bag (it's certainly no Kubrick) and of course the thematic elements are about as subtle as a brick to the face (about as bad as District 9 in that regard).\n\nPersonally, the issue is not that it's \"*being so deep /s*\". It's that it's philosophically so adolescent. This isn't something like The Lobster (to choose a recent dystopian piece which is deeply thematic and metaphorical) let alone a classic like Blade Runner which is a masterpiece of subtlety and ambiguity.  Instead, V for Vendetta sets up this largely black and white world devoid of moral ambiguity or shades of gray. To put it into a soundbite, classics are painted in shades of gray, and there is none of that in V for Vendetta.",

Basically, by taking out the (deliberate) confusion from the source material the movie cut straight to the heart of its audience but (in my opinion) made the feelings that it invoked cheaper for doing so.",

In a ton of his books, Palahniuk will establish an idea or a theme in contrast to the darker implications of society just to subtly subvert it by the time everything's said and done. Fight Club was my favorite example of that, in my opinion. I'm sure that everyone has a different interpretation than I do and I'm sure that many of theirs are much truer to the author's intent than mine are.",

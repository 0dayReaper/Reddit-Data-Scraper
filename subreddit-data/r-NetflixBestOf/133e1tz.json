It had all the feels, and it took you on such a ride. \n\n&gt;! In the beginning, I wasn\u2019t sure where this story was going. I knew mom was going to die, but still not sure where the story was going. I just enjoyed Ollie\u2019s and Billy\u2019s story hoping they would wind up with each other. !&lt;\n\n&gt;! But when Ollie got to Billy\u2019s house and it was run down\u2026 I did not see that coming. Like I had no idea all that time went past. Oh man\u2026 still brining all the feels. !&lt;\n\nPoints of discussion:\n&gt;! Where was Ollie all that time? !&lt;\nCan other stuffed animals talk? I know we saw talking, but what about other toys?\n\nAgain, this show was incredible.",

    "postText": "currently on episode 6, Season 2. was interesting so far but I don\u2019t find myself looking forward for more. I like the concept and it was definitely something different than what i have watched in a while. \n\nAlso, I hate Piper! I did not feel sorry for her in any scene. I tried to understand her but nah, i don\u2019t get her at all. Not a fan of Alex either. Even Larry is more likeable so far, he seems a little bit stupid tho. Good but stupid. I liked the latinos. And Red is probably my fave. Tasteyy, Nick and Morelles are also interesting.  \n\nBut overall i think i will not continue after this season unless something interesting comes up. Piper sucks and is dull for a main character. I saw some mixed reviews about this show. Is it worth watching after season 2?\n\nEdit: just finished ep 7, i don\u2019t like Larry and Poppy anymore.",

The show kind of gets lost in the middle and there's a decline in quality but they definitely focus on better characters.\n\nBut yeah hating Piper is half the fun of Orange is the New Black... I actually read the book to compare and the author seemed very similar, kind of privileged, a little on the whiny side. But hey those are the type of people who get traditional publishing deals so I've just learned to accept it.",

They should've done it sooner, but it was great.",

I still haven't watched the final season because I just don't want to finish the show and lose all these wacky characters. The show is not good throughout but it's very entertaining. You can watch Wentworth if you need a better show.",

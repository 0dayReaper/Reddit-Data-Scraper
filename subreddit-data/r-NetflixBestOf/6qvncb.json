These characters are nothing alike and demonstrate a very broad range.  He's even done voice acting in toy story and polar express\n\nCapt Phillips just recently did it for me.  I grew up watching Hanks.  it's like I had a new found appreciation for him.  The very end when he's portraying someone in shock really drew me in.  Maybe now that he's older he's more of a typecast.  But I'm his prime there wasn't a role he couldn't do.\n\nI feel the exact same way about Gyllenhal now.\n\nDaniel Day Lewis and Gary Oldman don't home a candle to Hanks.  If I could block out Bale's tirade on set that went viral and that I just about always think of batman when i hear his name I'd still put him short of Hanks.",

Yet still the vast majority of the jokes didn't hit with anyone and the theater was dead for most the movie. The main plot is about a freshman trying to get a girl and none of the dialog between people seemed legitimate (spoilers) for instance at the very end of the movie the main boy sends his love interest an emoji that changes into other emojis and she walks up to him and says \"Wow that was a really cool emoji that you sent me\" then proceeded to ask him to an upcoming dance. I only thought there were 2 good jokes but they still weren't laugh out laud funny more of blow air out of your nose funny (the first one is when the main emoji helps emoticons cross the street and says he loves helping the elderly, the other is when the devil emoji is talking to the angel emoji and try's to sell her a time share). The worst part of all though is when they go into the YouTube app and watch pen pineapple apple pen and then distract the bad guys with a cat video\n\n\nI would recommend it if you love watching bad movies like in a Mystery Science Theater kind of way but even then still don't expect much\n\n\nAlso tons of advertisements and it felt like they created it with spots where commercials could go in mind",

It's one of my favorite movies.\n\n\nThe movie was shot in under a month, similar to Whiplash. Many of the crew in the beginning said that they wouldn't be able to get all the footage they needed and there would be significant cuts. Writer/Director Dan Gilroy took this as a personal challenge and got everything in the script into the movie with the filming of night scenes wrapping up minutes before daylight.\n\n\nBut the reason Dan was able to do this was because Jake G. was insanely dedicated to his performance. He had all of his lines memorized months in advance (promising Dan that he wouldn't change a line of dialogue) and basically knew the character backwards and forwards. In return for his commitment, Dan gave him a lot of control over his portrayal, letting him keep his hair long. It was Jake's idea to give him a man bun even though Dan had imagined the character with short hair. Gyllenhaal wanted to be able to put his hair up whenever he was about to \"do something larcenous.\"\n\n\nNightcrawler is the best.",

But the scene they did before that was when he grabs the mirror and screams into it. The mirror wasn't supposed to break and Gyllenhaal actually sliced his hand during it, so in the guard scene, you never see his hand because it's got a bandage on it.\n\n\nThe scene in the pawn shop was giving the director and cinematographer trouble because they couldn't figure out how to make it interesting, it was just shot reverse shot. They were talking it out when Jake jumped on the bike and started riding it. They looked at each other and started filming.\n\n\nSo Dan Gilroy mostly just worked on big blockbusters before Nightcrawler. He wrote the first draft of Kong, Skull Island and one of the later Bourne movies. However, he wrote Nightcrawler because he was sick of the rules he had to follow when you write scripts for studios. The script is BONKERS. If you've never read a script before, read a script for a movie you like, my personal favorite script is In Bruges: it's very clean. Then read the script for Nightcrawler. It's wild. There's no EXT./INT. headers. There's no full stops outside of dialogue. It's all ellipsis and colons and whatnot. There's no character descriptions either. I've read it twice. Nightcrawler is a great movie, but reading that script is insane.\n\n\nIn terms of film recommendations, my favorite movie of all time is Birdman. If you want stuff on Netflix, check out Christopher Nolan's movies, if you somehow haven't seen them: Memento and Following. Following doesn't have great acting but the plot construction is really good. If you want classics, M is fantastic in terms of how it uses diagetic sound and dramatic irony. And 12 Angry Men is probably my 2nd favorite film of all time. Those two are on YouTube",

I was immediately like OMG ITS LA and I got all excited bc I grew up with Pat Harvey giving the news, and there was a painted wall I had passed not even the month before. You know what this boy, who had never even been west of Alabama said? He told me it's just a set and probably based on New York or somewhere. As the movie progressed it became more and more obvious that it was Los Angeles and that lil bitch didn't even apologize for shooting me down when I was definitely right and he didn't know SHIT. I'm still overly salty about it. ",

Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Lou Bloom, a driven young man desperate for work who discovers the high-speed world of L.A. crime journalism. Finding a group of freelance camera crews who film crashes, fires, murder and other mayhem, Lou muscles into the cut-throat, dangerous realm of nightcrawling - where each police siren wail equals a possible windfall and victims are converted into dollars and cents. Aided by Rene Russo as Nina, a veteran of the blood-sport that is local TV news, Lou blurs the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n&gt; Nightcrawler received highly positive reviews from critics, with many praising Gyllenhaal's performance and Gilroy's script. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 95% based on 234 reviews, with a rating average of 8\\.2\\/10\\. The site's critical consensus reads\\: \"Restless, visually sleek, and powered by a lithe star performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, Nightcrawler offers dark, thought-provoking thrills.\" On Metacritic, another review aggregator, the film has a score of 76 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2013\" on an A\\+ to F scale.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Nightcrawler+%282014%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nightcrawler%20%28film%29), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nightcrawler/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/nightcrawler), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70295182), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15154975).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F6qvncb \"Confidence: 1.04\").

It's a cult classic for a reason. \n\nJake's character is relatively flat, staying the same creepy guy from start to end. His final \"decision\" is completely unsurprising and just for shock value. That's kind of how the whole movie went. It would depict a scenario with some clear choices and the characters would always (unsurprisingly) go with the morally questionable outcome. \n\nIt felt like an episode of criminal minds (or another cop show) where you only followed the rapist. But instead of having some interesting fetish or method, you're just watching the protagonist go out in the middle of night and do horrible things. ",

But I'll never forget when he finally can afford that nice dodge and he's cruising down the street with it, engine roaring like crazy. My gf looks over at me \"you need to buy us that car.\" She has no interest in vehicles whatsoever I just thought it was hilarious. The stunt driving in the movie was insane though for what it's worth. ",

            "comment": "I had a fun thought while watching this film, which was that the narrative structure had more in common with video games than with traditional cinema. Let me explain:\n\n1. The whole film is based around two core \"mechanics\": driving and filming.\n\n2. The film gradually introduces new twists on these mechanics to increase the complexity and add variety.\n\n3. There's a steadily increasing difficulty curve for both mechanics, until the end in which the mechanics are combined together.\n\n4. The mechanics are central to the story: most of the scenes revolve around these mechanics, and the handful of scenes that don't are primarily just providing context for the mechanics and challenge.\n\n5. Overcoming challenges allows the protagonist to unlock tools to improve his skills in the core mechanics (better car, better camera, support characters).\n\n6. The film treats the mechanics themselves as essentially morally neutral: although characters within the film criticise Lou's methods, the film never does, and always treats Lou overcoming challenges as its own reward.\n\n7. Most tellingly, the film does not have a conventional cinematic three-act structure: instead, the dramatic tension comes from escalating complexity and difficulty in the core mechanics.\n\nJust my two cents.",

A close-up of Movie-Lou rearranging pictures on a fridge in a home he trespassed, is more likely to make us feel like accomplices. VG-Lou manipulates the same things around him would be part of world-building.\n\nYour points explain why the bike shop scene feels so organic to Lou's MO though.",

There, after a chance encounter with the always boozy but merciful Father Tommasso, the young charmer will find refuge into his convent's sanctuary, on one condition\\: to pretend he is a deaf-mute. However, Massetto's tempting presence will unavoidably upset the already frail balance of things within the sexually-repressed female realm, as nun after nun desperately seeks an escape from their tedious way of life and an extra reason to molest the charming handyman. In the end, will those cloistered Sisters finally find out what they had been missing out on all these years?\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n&gt; The Little Hours received positive reviews from film critics. It holds a 79% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 105 reviews, with a weighted average of 6\\.4\\/10\\. The website's critical consensus reads\\: \"The Little Hours gets plenty of goofy mileage out of its gifted ensemble, anchoring its ribald laughs in a period comedy with some surprisingly timely subtext.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 69 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?The+Little+Hours+%282017%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The%20Little%20Hours), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/The_Little_Hours), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-little-hours), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24806853).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2Fa9kwih \"Confidence: 0.97\").

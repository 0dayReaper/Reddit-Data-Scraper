Dickhead in the security wants bigger toys, sure why the fuck not? Power trip? Sure. Basically everything up until conflict starts actually happening in the movie, it's decent and believable-ish. As soon as things start happening, it just jumps the shark so hard that it's completely unwatchable for me. Oh well.",

[\u2026]\n\n\u201cDie Antwoord are vegan and they refused to eat the vegetarian food on set. They made their driver go into town from Soweto every day to fetch special food.\u201d\n\nTheir image may be zef and trashy but the vegans only drink Veuve Clicquot champagne when they take alcohol.

Mild spoilers ahead: \n\n\nIn one scene, [Chappie, who basically has the brain of a four-year-old child, is abandoned, beaten, and left for dead by a bunch of men who think he is still a police droid. Watching him get brutally beaten while having no idea what was going on or why they were hurting him really fucked with me] (/spoiler) and that ruined the entirety of the movie for me",

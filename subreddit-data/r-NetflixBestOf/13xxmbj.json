    "postText": "So, I am a TV watcher as my primary stress relief, but I currently have nothing but time on my hands for a few weeks, so I need to get a good lineup ready.  I'm hoping to just binge interesting shows back to back. Recently, I've binged through Succession and yellowjackets and just loved them. I've also watched love and death and Candy, little fires everywhere, last of us, the outsider, tiny beautiful things, pokerface, chippendales, and all of Ryan Murphys' wonderful contributions to TV lol. For older shows, I've seen BB, sopranos, OZ, the wire, game of thrones, pretty much the big ones. Ozark, Big little lies, and Better call Saul as well. I love getting gripped into a show. Yellowjackets kept me up past my bedtime, and I love that lol. I've got some time before I'm going to be back to busy life, so I'm hoping to find something I've missed or maybe discounted. Thank you!",

Absolutely incredible show -- one of those shows that I wish I could erase from my memory and watch fresh again without knowing anything about it.\n\nBased on your list of shows, I believe you'd like Severance (Apple TV) as well. Silo has also been solid but they're still releasing weekly episodes of the first season, so wouldn't fit the definition of something to binge.",

The setting and topic might turn people off but if you can handle sex scenes then it's a very gripping and fascinating character study, and just a fun binge in general.",

They are *generally* just one season (made-specifically-for-Netflix-dramas tend to have more than one season) with a book structure of a beginning, middle, and end.  My favorites on Netflix right now:\n\n* Alchemy of Souls (2 seasons, 20 season 1/10 season 2)    \n* The Glory (2 seasons, 8 episodes each)    \n* Queenmaker (11 episodes)    \n* Twenty-five Twenty-one (16 episodes)    \n* Under the Queen's Umbrella (16 episodes)    \n* All of Us are Dead (12 episodes, 2nd season in 2024)     \n* Crash Landing on You (16 episodes)    \n* Vincenzo (16 episodes)    \n* Itaewon Class (16 episodes)    \n* It\u2019s Okay to Not Be Okay (16 episodes)    \n* Navillera (16 episodes)    \n* My Mister (16 episodes)    \n* Mr. Sunshine (24 episodes)  \n* Kingdom (2 seasons, 6 episodes each)    \n* Extraordinary Attorney Woo (16 episodes)    \n* Mr. Queen (20 episodes)    \n* Beyond Evil (16 episodes)    \n* Flower of Evil (16 episodes)   \n\nAnd so many more.... I've tried to give you a good mix of romcom, thriller, and mystery.  They're fun, generally short series that end properly.  If subtitles are something you can get used to, Netflix has no shortage of really good Kdramas.  There are a few English dubbed Kdramas, if you just really really can't do subs, but I suggest you try.  There's absolutely nothing like hearing Kim Woo Bin's buttery voice for the first time :):)",

The mystery is so-so, but the thriller is pretty good and the dialogue between the two cops is outstanding.     \n* Stranger - (2 seasons, but they have little to do with each other) - The first season of Stranger is nearly perfect TV.  A prosecutor who has had the emotions literally cut out of his head and a spunky investigator chase corruption in the Prosecutor's office all the way to the Blue House (head of government in Korea).  The second season is good, but it deals with who in Korea has jurisdiction over the investigation of cases.  Since that's not how we do things in the US, it couldn't hold my interest as well.  It's not bad, it just didn't resonate with me like the first season.    \n* Flower of Evil - A husband who is hiding things and his cop wife encounter a been-doing-this-for-a-while serial killer. Awesome depiction of a strong marriage. Great mystery.    \n* The Glory - A woman who suffered horrific bullying while in school chases revenge.  So very very good.  Tight writing.    \n* Signal - A profiler from 2015 and a cop from 1998 join forces via a time-connected walkie talkie to solve crimes.  That sounds terrible.  It's not.:)    \n* Little Women - About three sisters with a close bond who grew up in poverty.  They get embroiled in a major incident and face off against the wealthiest family in the nation.    \n* Sky Castle - A distinctly Korean story about a building full of very affluent people and an incident that happens.  A little over-the-top, but very fun and good.    \n* Extracurricular - Follow the life and times of a couple of incredibly morally ambiguous High Schoolers and their adventures in crime.    \n* Bad and Crazy - More comedic than the rest of the dramas on this list.  It follows the life of a will-do-anything-for-a-promotion cop as someone throws a wrench into his plans.\n\nIf you want more, or something more specific /r/kdramarecommends is a fairly busy sub with lots of folks with different opinions.

Check it out.... The major suspect was related to Willowbrooks mental institution and some even thought that he was demon possessed. Though some sections of the documentary was difficult to watch as it shows small children in very bad condition in the mental institutions other than that... It's good.",

Especially the parts where the inmates were without clothes and in one scene there was an old man who was naked too and he was clearly agitated and the guards were purposefully trying to agitate him even more by asking him the same question again and again and took him to get a shave also and the person who was shaving was so heartless and was very careless in his work and there was blood from the corners of his mouth from a small cut ..... That really hurt . I mean I have a small scene where the orderlies are putting my character in a straight jacket and in a padded room but this movie was pure torture. I mean I can see why they banned this. They should have atleast blurred the nakedness they got showing and even the faces of the victims so that their identities were hidden. This was purely invasive of their privacy .",

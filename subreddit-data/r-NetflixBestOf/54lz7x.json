A real, \"And now, a moment to point out the REAL purpose of this movie,\" sort of thing.\n\nPersonally, I'd much rather have had the details of the whole predator-prey thing done much more subtly until it crowned off at the climax with the villain's motive rant. That would allow for a smooth rise, climax, and fall. As it was, it had a nice smooth rise, but then had these weird spikes two or three times through the movie when it side-tracked to really hammer the point home. I mean, you could cut those two-three moments and the film would still scan perfectly.\n\nBut really, other than those points the movie was about as close to perfect as you can get.",

You'd think they'd be way more evolved and smarter than the rest of the animals. \n\n\nDo tiny parts of zootopia have separate police forces? Because a Elephant can't really arrest a tiny little mouse just not anatomically possible. Do large animals frequently step on tiny creatures? Would they be arrested? Do other animals like Judy frequently terrorize small parts of Zootopia?\n\nDid marine animals and birds evolve as well? Are there underwater cities? Is Zootopia the only city in the world? Do places like Bunnyville have their own cops and mayors? Is there a president of the country of Zootopia? \n\nDoes every animal have a name that's a pun of them being their specific animal?\n\nWe deserve answers Disney",

Remember, canon doesn't just mean the established continuity or \"official universe\" that you're probably used to seeing it used in (film franchises, comic franchises, etc), but refers to a standard. \n\nA canon is a sort of reed and was used as a measuring rod in antiquity. As a metaphor, it became the term to mean an objective standard in any field\u2014that by which all is measured. You'll see it used with fiction\u2014the [Western Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_canon), and [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_canon), as well as in [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_canon). Here, they're meaning that Zootopia is a member of Disney's official canon, which would be the in-house Disney flicks like Snow White, Cinderella, etc.; contrasted here with the \"overall\" disney films, which include the Disney/Pixar team-ups, etc. ",

I was  browsing through last night, have loads of things in my list but when it comes to the time when I want to start watching something new i'm like 'meh' and then end up not watching anything at all because i've  browsed too long and it gets too late.\n\nI'm  currently watching Night Agent, it's ok (watchable) but not all that  great in all honest, I find most tv shows/movies on streaming services  today are just that (watchable but not great) and Disney is absolute  rubbish.\n\nIs it like that for everyone else?   Where are all modern day movies/tv shows that are going to go  down as classics ie going to still be watched by generations 50  years from now?  80's/90's used to make classic movies/tv shows reguarly  (and less was produced) and we all knew they was going to be classics  even as they was happening, where are the ones today?\n\nThe only true classics i can think of recent years that may be watched by generations into the future are Game of Thrones/Breaking Bad/Stranger Things/Chernobyl/The Boys/Haunting of Hill House (not that many really).\n\nHighest rated movies today on IMDB tend to be when a new Batman movie comes out  (always overrated), where are the Pulp Fiction movies of today?",

It was featured on the front page of Netflix for about a week but that\u2019s it. It seemed to have been muddled up with the release of the Night Agent which was very forgettable. \n\nSeverance (97% / 85% on RT) is quite good, but not for everyone. At first I expected it to be weird just for the sake of weirdness, but its plot depth is impressive and its dry absurdist humor hits the spot for me. \n\nIn my eyes, \u201cwell known\u201d recommendations would be Breaking Bad, Sopranos, Black Mirror, Succession etc. Shows that are so ubiquitous that they aren\u2019t even worth mentioning.",

            "comment": "Pulp Fiction was really a cultural phenomenon. It's like the movie equivalent of Nirvana with how it was received and basically creating a whole new popular genre. Those kind of things generally don't happen. It takes the right set of circumstances, not just Tarantino but Miramax too. Making a violent, $18 million ($8.5 million in 1993) movie about a heroin-using criminal played by Ashton Kutcher, or whoever the modern equivalent of 1990s John Travolta is, told out of sequence would be a pretty tall order today.\n\nBut yeah, I do think this isn't as great a time for filmed entertainment as it seems like it could be, with how much money is being thrown around and how much less expensive it is to shoot digitally, especially compared to the indie film boom. I think the economics of streaming pushes quantity over quality, and people are less interested in looking for breakout hits than they are building brands and making safe-bet content for a subscription service. I do think there are good things being made, like The Young Pope, The Leftovers, Succession.\n\nIn a sense, pop culture is meant to be disposable. People don't make new pop songs because the old ones don't work anymore, like there've been exciting new developments in music or dancing or broken hearts that require us to upgrade to new songs. It's less about making things that are timeless and more about marking time. So we revisit and remember the summer we all watched The Avengers, or Pulp Fiction, or Top Gun: Maverick, or when we all listened to Olivia Rodrigo or LMFAO everywhere we went. We still can and do go back to those things, and some things probably would be hits no matter when they came out. It's a lot harder to have universal cultural experiences as entertainment gets more crowded and specialized.",

The problem I ran into was the \"it's only x a month.\" I started with Netflix then Apple then HBO, Hulu, Britbox Peacock and a few others and realized that I was paying more and watching less and enjoying not having the TV on so much. My solution was to cancel everything but Apple and get a $20 wall antenna. Now the TV is on for 2-3 hours a day and it's quite relaxing not being addicted to it.",

It\u2019s catering towards those who like crappy formulaic shows like NBC/CBS/ABC produce. Means you have to wade through a ton of shit to find quality shows.

It\u2019s easy to find something good and you want to watch most of the stuff on the service. On Netflix now I expect all the new movies and shows to be shit and am surprised if there\u2019s something good released. It\u2019s draining and I never browse Netflix for things to watch anymore as it\u2019s a waste of time. Netflix is only used if I hear about shows that\u2019s gotten good reviews and I know is high quality. When shared accounts aren\u2019t allowed where I am anymore I won\u2019t resubscribe and use other means to watch the few good shows that are released.",

I haven't finished, but I heard The Bad Batch season 2 was great as well.\n\nAlso we see this with movies as well. Because of how much content there is now, as well as the fact that we don't consume content on as set of a schedule, things get muddled. The cream rises to the top, but some things get ignored/forgotten. For instance, I feel like Severance should have an audience twice the size that it had. I keep talking to people who haven't even heard of it. On the other hand, my mom has been watching Grace and Frankie for years, and I just started it a few weeks ago. It's hilarious, but I didn't catch it because it wasn't in my normal group of things to watch.",

Not enough for some people but for those who love it... they won't forget it.\n\nAdvantageous - It's disturbing on so many levels I'm betting it makes it to the future. Not sure if it will be a classic. \n\nRussian Doll and Queen's Gambit I think are unique enough to have Real Potential for the future.\n\nI'm borderline about, What Happened to Monday?\" Enough might like it enough to get it to the future. \n\nCheers!",

They don\u2019t seem to like what the audience likes,\u201d says the top agent. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m sorry, but people seem to really like Two and a Half Men, and none of my writers want to write that. They all want to write Barry. And you know who watches Barry? Nobody.\u201d\n\n&gt;To make up for the lost back end, streamers floated performance-based incentives. Schur describes a scenario in which a platform might promise a showrunner a $100,000 bonus for season one, $250,000 for season two, $500,000 for season three, and $1.7 million for season four. \u201cSo you\u2019re like, Holy shit. This is great!\u201d he says. There was a catch. **Many seemingly successful series began to vanish after just a couple of seasons.** \u201cWhat no one saw coming was they\u2019d just kill the show before they ever had to pay that money out,\u201d Schur says. \u201cThey kind of tricked everybody. Now if you get to 20 episodes, it\u2019s a miracle.\u201d\n\nNon-paywall https://archive.is/Unfis",

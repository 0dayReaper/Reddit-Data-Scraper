They're often less \"laugh your ass off\" comical, but more of a humor you can relate to. Superbad was a tad outlandish for me to relate to, but movies like The Way Way Back, Juno (closer to 17yo but still relatable humor), and The Fundamentals of Caring are all more like every day dramas infused with humor, and makes them more entertaining, in my opinion.

I think there's something really entertaining about seeing veteran actors play roles that could have just as easily been played by no-name actors and without drawing any extra attention to themselves, like Sam Rockwell, AnnaSophia Robb, and Steve Carell. They just make it fun/dramatic but never detract the story from the main character. I know I've seen some other coming of age movies like this but I can't remember them for the life of me.\n\nEdit: The Kings of Summer was a fucking good one too. After seeing Nick Offerman play such a cable-ized censored but somewhat uncensored character on P&amp;R, it was bizarre for him to mention something about his teenage son masturbating within the first five minutes of the movie. I'm sure there's a name for the genre of movie that takes huge leaps away from mainstream movies with the persistent swearing and oddballness, but that's beside the point. Very entertaining coming of age movie with real-world situations and not overly dramatic story line.\n\nEdit: And The Spectacular Now",

To have his car towed, only for them to break in and steal it seems contrived. \n\nThe Seth, Evan and McLovin are all freaked out about trying to buy beer, I don't think committing a serious crime would be true to the characters at all and would just venture into the typical 'crazy teen comedy' trope. \n\nA lot of the humor doesn't come from what they're doing, but how they react to the situations they're put in.

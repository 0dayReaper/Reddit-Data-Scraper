    "postText": "So I started watching XO kitty because a friend said it\u2019s cute. I will not comment on quality or anything, mainly because I\u2019m only 2 episodes in, but I do have thoughts I\u2019d love your input on:  \n- is it just me or is some of the Korean they speak is with an accent? I mean the ones who are supposed to be native Korean. I don\u2019t speak Korean but I watched a few shows and my ear detects something off.  \n- names: is it just me or are the chosen names deliberately easy and western ear friendly? Dae, Yuri, Jina, Song, Bora\u2026 Even Min Ho which is a very korean name, but some can recognize from the actor Lee Min Ho. It feels like the equivalent of an American show naming everyone Joe, Jake and Jane. I wish they were braver with those, helping the audience get comfortable with Korean names and culture to help get ppl into their Kdrama content  \n- the wardrobe and communication style is very relaxed and not very modest, it\u2019s quite different from what you\u2019d see in a kdrama.  \n- the teacher saying: oh you\u2019re American? I admire you guys Netflix are you Doing a USA rally on screen? What\u2019s with the American PR pushing?  \n- just an anecdote: when she was walking the Myeondong (?) streets not finding her way - no one was helping her. It happened to my friend and she had like 5 different people offering her assistance lol and yes. I know I\u2019m not supposed to dissect the logic in these things but you know. I\u2019m offended on behalf of South Korea.  \n- I do like the kdrama trope they introduced- the &gt;!fake relationship contract!&lt; is one of my favorites.",

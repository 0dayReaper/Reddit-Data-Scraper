It deserves so much more than it gets. *So* much more. \n\nThat, and the 1990s adaptation of *\u201dThe Stand\u201d* oh my gosh. It was one of those \u2018made for TV movies\u2019 so if you watch it in one sitting it is exactly 6hrs (originally aired on tv on 3 nights in a row, 2hr each). The full film, uninterrupted, is on YouTube and I cannot stress enough how much I wish more people have seen this too!\n\nAlso\u2026 SK himself is a character in *\u201dThe Stand\u201d* so you KNOW that if HE is in one of his adaptations, it has to be bomb. He wouldn\u2019t dare be so connected to a project that isn\u2019t up to his standards. (On that note, he\u2019s also in the opening credit sequence of one of the seasons of *\u201dMr. Mercedes\u201d* so there\u2019s that as an indication of how good it is!)\n\nWow I didn\u2019t realize how long this comment is LOL thanks for coming to my Stephen King TEDTalk lmao",

I'll tell you why I like them, they're personal to me, but maybe they'll connect to you\n\nFreaks and Geeks -Hulu. Sadly only 1 season but it's really great. If you like period pieces, it's also very 80s\n\nMy Mad Fat Diary- British. e4, youtube it's been a few years since I watched the show but it was uploaded on YouTube full episodes. If you can't find it let me know and I'll do additional digging. Deals with depression and low self esteem, not feeling comfortable in our bodies, and resilience. It's a tearjeaker and funny at times show that does not emotionally manipulate\n\n\nNever Have I Ever. NETFLIX. I know some people don't like Mindy Kaling's work so you may skip if it's not your thing. But it deals with intergenerational conflict, first born American challenges, family grief, jealousy, puberty and sexuality which I thought was refreshing \n\n\n\nGinny and Georgia.Netflix. I think this is more aimed to girls and women but it talks about things that I rarely see get shown on TV for youth. Deals with growing up biracial and feeling othered at times, self harm, sexual assault,  heart break, anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. It does a good job of being explicit but respectful\n\nAnd a great film to watch is Mud",

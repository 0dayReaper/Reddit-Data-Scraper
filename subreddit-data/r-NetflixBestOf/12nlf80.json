With short episodes (at least they feel short), a unique spin on everything, lots of randomness and great acting. I recommend iZombie to many people but ironically have never watched past the first season and that was years ago. I guess because it seems like a \u201ccommitment series\u201d with the number of seasons out. I have a short attention span okay.",

That Trash Leader and Alpha, Beta &amp; The Whisperers just became to central for me. Negan had a unique quirk and seemed like someone whose personality was able to be released finally. A true sociopath. Despite his BS wife story.\nLike the apocalypse didn\u2019t change him as much as it did for someone like Alpha who just grew worse &amp; worse as a person.",

The character development was phenomenal. What lost me &amp; is why I actually haven\u2019t finished the show. Despite being glued to every episode, something that is rare for me and my attention span, was the hiatus. I just weirdly lost interest. I hate what the ability to binge watch has done to me. It\u2019s fed into my ADHD. Same with Survivor (I know off topic.) But I used to watch &amp; wait an entire week for the next episode since the first season when I was 10 years old. Then I\u2019d download (before streaming existed) so I could have the entire season before beginning. Just so I could watch it in succession. Therefore TWD and then with Covid shows &amp; their forced extended breaks, they just lost me.",

My biggest issue with the show over time was how the inhumanity became normalized and cruelty became casual. In the end I just didn\u2019t care at all about the main characters, because they didn\u2019t care about the fate of strangers. They had become awful human beings with zero compassion beyond their own little bubble. \n\nThere is a scene in season 5 or 6, I forget, where they drive past a random man on the street, who calls out to them for help. He\u2019s alone, not infected. They ignore him, they don\u2019t even discuss picking him up. On their way back they come by his mangled corpse. Again no discussion, no emotion. They just stop the car and steal his things, no comment about the fact that their indifference got him killed.\n\nAfter that I got disgusted with the show. Didn\u2019t like the main characters anymore, didn\u2019t care if they lived or died. So I stopped watching.",

Considering two characters had to quite literally carry the entire season. There were some mundane parts but somehow that made it feel every more realistic. \n\nThe human element is what drew me in. Same as TWD, which somehow managed to create growth for every character throughout the seasons despite having so many. I\u2019m interested to see where The Last of Us goes in S2.

(Meaning the focus is mainly on the relationships of the characters, the politics of living 20 years into a zombie apocalypse, and the world building of the apocalypse rather than just killing zombies) but the last of us show is so fucking good. IMO if they are able to pull off the second game as well as they did the first, then I would say the show is the best way to experience the story. S1 kept the core parts of the story the same while adding things in and changing smaller things to really add more context to the story. It is honestly a 10/10 show so far, and the zombies are definitely a part of it, but they are not the greatest evil in the show. Which I think makes for a much more interesting story than the standard zombie show that has been done a million times.",

Anyway, my recommendations are:\n\n- Kingdom (saw that a lot here, it\u2019s a unique take mixed in with political drama, I was really surprised by some of the twists, and I love when I can\u2019t guess the plot beforehand)\n- All Of Us Are Dead (panicky and really emotional, mixed with teenage/puberty angst, you will be yelling at your screen while bawling your eyes out)\n- Alive (movie, really modern, mostly from a one-person perspective, felt quite IRL)\n- Sweet Home (not actually Zombie, but similar, very interesting characters, and great music)",

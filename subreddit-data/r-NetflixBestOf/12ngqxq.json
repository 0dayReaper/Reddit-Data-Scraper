Your gripe is actually that they used the word like to signify they like something. So they aren't being very articulate, so what? The grammar is correct.\n\nNice try though.

There are subplots that go nowhere. The main plot is meandering, with a heavy-handed backstory that the viewer is supposed to be emotionally invested in. Some of the actors are just plain terrible.

It's not a Cuban or Mexican accent, so it doesn't really fit Florida. His father is played by an Australian actor who's \"American\" accent is fairly decent, but it does seem to come from some other country, and definitely not Florida.\n\nThe plot is a bit trite, there's a few random impossible things that happen, but nothing most people will notice. The fractional timeline, the way you gradually piece together bits of the main character's history, could be interesting except it's so underplayed that it's almost not there, as if the tiny pieces are fitting together accidentally because it's all a dream we're overdue to wake from.\n\nIf you're not from Florida or even America, it might be a perfectly fine diversion, though. But the jury's still out on whether it'll have a satisfying ending. Maybe if any of the characters were likeable or relatable I could get more invested and pay closer attention. But when I try, I notice the acting. And that's a real pity.",

I\u2019ve only watched episode one but it was decent, an easy watch and a bit of fun. I\u2019m from Australia so don\u2019t know much about Florida but even just the guy obsessed with having a gun I found hilarious because that\u2019s so American to us aussies. Yes the accent is different from his families but again it\u2019s not a serious crime show and not pretending to be either so I can look past it. They could have grown up overseas and left when he was a late teen and he kept the accent and the sister is a lot younger so lost hers? I don\u2019t really care tbh haha \n\nAnd look I could hate it after more episodes but for now it\u2019s entertaining enough to keep going.",

Coronado Beach is in California.

I mean Florida is the third biggest state in the country and Orlando is where Disney is, one of the biggest tourist attractions in the country in a huge city... yet they're making it out like it's a podunk town.\n\nNOTHING ABOUT THE SHOW IS FLORIDA\n\nso it's odd they called it Florida Man or made it seem like it had anything to do with Florida.\n\nThe worst part is two different people get arrested simply for having a gun, that destroys all realism for me and is just bad storytelling.\n\nI'll say, if you want to poke fun at Florida you should make everybody have a gun in their car and it just be normal.\n\nthe writers should understand **no one in Florida would ever get arrested for simply having a gun in their car**, it's not illegal and never has been; as such without a warrant they couldn't take it from you to test ballistics to even know it was a crime gun. it would just be perfectly legal a gun in your car.\n\nin fact Florida just passed the law saying you can carry a gun on you and you don't even need a license anymore so literally every resident of the state can carry a gun and it's not illegal there's no reason to be arrested for it... yet again, two separate people get arrested in this show for just having a gun, it's ridiculous.\n\nso not only am I not impressed much with the story, the accuracy is so far off I can't even enjoy that part of it.",

My ONLY issue is beyond the title it has nothing to do with FL.\n\nThe producers are basically trying to make money of the FL community without giving any to back to FL, the show has nothing to do with FL... they didn't film in Florida so no on location attributes or advertising, they didn't used FL restaurant's... \"Gator Tail\" what the hell is that? or beaches to bolster their publicity.\n\nIf someone international comes to the US looking to give their tourist dollars to Coronado Beach they'll end up in California. However they could have simply used a FICTIONAL beach name instead of a popular CA beach, or even better, just say Cocoa Beach and actual popular beach in Central FL, and simply spend a little budget on fake signage even if it wasn't filmed there.",

You can't look at a gun and know it was used in a murder, you would have to have probable cause or a warrant to even test the gun... and that would be days if not weeks down the road. Regardless, AN OFFICER from another state having a gun would lead to either outcome.\n\nTo your other point, being from out of state has no bearing.\n\n&gt;Either way, it's a comedic crime show about a fictional \"Florida\".

As someone that lives specifically were this show was set, NOT ONE GOD DAMN THING IS CORRECT OR DEALS WITH FL. That is not an exaggeration LITERALLY not one thing. I'd be fine with \"part\" being film elsewhere as you said.\n\nThis is already a fairly bad show so I don't really care about plot holes, and who cares about it being a gritty drama, you? I never said that. YOU can nitpick about the plot or whatever else you want... **I only have ONE NITPICK**, the show is called **FLORIDA MAN** it is set in Central Florida. So I think is fine to expect them to show SOME THINGS that have to do with EITHER. For locals but also for people like you, not from here that have no idea. But, **literally not one thing is shown or has to do with Central Florida or FL, so why call it FL Man**.\n\nThey mention Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club... that was torn down in 2020, so bad mention to start with.. but moreover they don't even show it, no location shots... and that mention's about it. So because I was expecting most of it to be about Central FL or at least FL in general, to see it's not even \"some\" but actually NONE of it about FL plus they can't even get a good accurate joke on the gun laws means literally, they did not research or didn't care and it has nothing to do with FL except it's title... I think that's a pretty big and reasonable nitpick.",

She simply would have been fired and a warrant would\u2019ve been put out for her the second she abandoned her post and went after a case halfway across the country, to which she was not personally assigned, and she obviously had a personal connection to. IRL cops are strictly put as a far as possible away from cases they\u2019re personally connected with and once I saw the scene where she got shot I immediately turned off my tv and decided to never waste my time on earth watching that show ever again. Like seriously the entire show could\u2019ve done without her and her nonsense. The entire plot of florida man could\u2019ve done without that cop ex girlfriend. It seemed to me like the show literally just squeezed her into the plot after the script was already written. They were like \u201coh shit guys we forgot to add the woman of color\u201d and the writers were like \u201cyeah it\u2019s fine we can just insult the audience by shoving her in last minute and pretending like she\u2019s in any way relevant to the story. seriously whoever wrote this show needs to go work at a McDonald\u2019s or something because it was written so badly, and with such a large amount of political and cultural bias that every second is just a slap in the face to anyone watching. No matter their background or political alignment. You see this kind of bullshit writing all the time in Netflix shows. Station 19 comes to mind.",

LIKE ZEEEEROOO. It dosent matter. The series isn't about a literal \"Florida man\". It's about (or rather influenced by) the sheer ridiculousness that is the state of Florida and the stories that happen there. I don't know if its just stupid dense Americans that didn't get anything that this series is trying to tell. People are literally making it about the race of actors. Well. I'd like to think that all the people complaining about race and the shit under this post are literally the people that are getting make fun off in the series.

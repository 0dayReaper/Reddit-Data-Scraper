The dub also fits the setting better, given it takes place in 1930's New York.",

Some of the scenes in the OVAs are directly contrary to the source material, but considering that the first thirteen episodes also change a lot, just go ahead and watch all 16 eps while being aware that there are big changes.\n\nThere are no legal places to stream it since the license expired in Feb 2016, but since this is a Netflix subreddit apparently (just visiting; I track the 'baccano' keyword) it'll be appropriate to mention that US residents can still [rent the Baccano!

The people on that site are pretty good critics because its dedicated to anime and its what everyone uses. A few of my favorite anime- Clannad is number 1. I would not reccomend this show until you have watched a few anime first, this show for me was somewhat life changing. 2. shigatsu wa kimi no uso (your lie in april). Also really good but similar to Clannad. These two shows are both slice of Life (rom com kinda). Hunter X Hunter is very good as well (Action). Fate Zero is GREAT to start with as well. ",

It is really good but I would debate that FMAB is better because FMAB is fairly consistent in quality the whole way through while hxh has a somewhat lackluster beginning as well as dragging out the beginning of the chimera arc.  Also, the girl at the end with the ability to (spoiler) gon honesty should never have been in the story and somewhat undermined alot of the story at the same time. HXH DID have higher highs though then fmab for me. For me, I would rate fmab a 9.5 while giving hxh a 9.0",

I'd recommend cowboy bebop; it's what got me more into anime and it's very western-influenced. After that, I'd recommend death note which would ease you into the wonderful weird-ness of anime.

He was so excited to come back and got offed just as quickly.\n\nUnrelated aside, but at the same panel he talked about having done Krillin for so long that he was excited to be this big badass demon for Soul Eater.

I'd say it's more predictable by the kind of story you enjoy more. Everyone I've heard agree that 2003 was better prefer morally gray, kind of bittersweet stuff, but my friends who like Brotherhood better say it's better because of the culmination of all the stuff leading to the end. 2003 felt a lot more sad to me, particularly because of how homonculi are formed, Hohenheim's backstory, and the ending. But Brotherhood's ending involves all the people and events you'd expect it to, as well as having an actual meaningful fight to end things. \n\nEdit: s",

I just stopped watching the original about half-way through for some reason or another (don't really remember why), then a few years later watched Brotherhood after seeing so many people recommend it over the original. Since I still (mostly) remembered the character development from the original, I didn't have a problem with Brotherhood going through those first arcs a bit too quickly. \n\nThough I kinda wish Brotherhood didn't effectively skip that mini-arc with Ed/Al and Lieutenant Yoki, as he became a pretty important character later on, and if you didn't see the original 2003 anime, his motivations and the way he treats certain characters would make little to no sense.",

The issue that has happened is people keep suggesting to skip the original, and start with Brotherhood. You lose so much of Ed's early character development in Brotherhood, such as the Tucker/Nina arc. In Brotherhood, Nina gets about 4 minutes of screen time, in original, you get a full 2 episodes with her. This makes that arc fucking soul crushing in the original, and makes you understand why Ed's personality changes so much in the beginning as he gets his first taste of true evil.\n\n",

Mania Entertainment's Chris Beveridge said that the entertainment in these episodes lay in the differences in the characters' actions from the first series, and original content which focused on the emotional theme of the series. In another review, Beveridge praised the new fight scenes and said the extra drama which made these episodes \"solid\". Chris Zimmerman from Comic Book Bin said the series \"turns around and establishes its own identity\" because of the inclusion of new characters and revelations not shown in the first series, increasing its depth. He said the animation was superior to that of the first anime; his comments focused on the characters' expressions and the execution of the fight scenes. Writing for The Los Angeles Times, Charles Solomon ranked Brotherhood the second best anime of 2010 on his \"Top 10\".\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?%22Hagane+no+renkinjutsushi%22+%282009%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fullmetal%20Alchemist%3A%20Brotherhood), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70204981), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q437808).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F7nfoqp \"Confidence: 0.93\").

It takes place in a fictional European-like country and doesn't really follow many of the common anime tropes. The only thing that makes it anime is the art style IMO.\n\nIt has always been one of my favorite anime series. It is extremely tight, barely any if any filler, fantastic characters and character development. The story is well told and emotional, and there are a few moments that will sneak up on you and fuck you up, forcing you to change how you look at the series and its characters. The animation is consistently good and often great. Some of the late series action sequences are borderline movie quality. One scene in particular involving a tank is forever etched in my brain as one of the coolest anime scenes ever. \n\nAnyways, watch it!\n\nEdit: it is also surprisingly violent",

Brotherhood is the manga adaptation while '03 has an anime original ending due to the creator not wanting to rush things since the manga wasn' t close to wrapping up. In my opinion '03 had a marginally better soundtrack, and much more thorough character development that Brotherhood traded in for the best action sequences in both series and much more concise ending. Glad to see both series landing somewhere for the time being.",

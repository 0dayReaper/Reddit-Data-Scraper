I did ask you to be specific though and you decided to be vague..... \n\nMy point is that for every moment you could identify as not possible today, I guarantee I can find something made this year that is just as offensive, if not worse. \n\nPeople are more vocally sensitive about political correctness now than in the past, but it is even easier today to produce and distribute an offensive movie than it was in the 90s.  It hasn't stopped anything in the name of humor. We have all sorts of racially sensitive comedies and fat people can still easily be made fun of today.  \n\nIt is true that you couldn't make it today without some people being upset about it, but \"offensive\" content continues to be produced and distributed. The only real point here is that Disney would certainly not be involved and it would probably have been more more in its original non-Disney form as a movie for adults.\n\nI agree this exact film could not be made, but you can say that about almost any movie out there. They are all specific products of their time that have specific investors, directors and actors that you might not be able to get to come together even one year later for a variety of reasons. \n\nWe get it. SJW are annoying, but let's not get ridiculous. ",

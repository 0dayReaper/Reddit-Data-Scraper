I compare him to Meryl Streep for the same qualities.  Regardless who they play they still sound and look exactly like Tom and Meryl.  I watched Otto and wished I hadn't.  He still looked and acted like Tom.",

I think Hanks knows the parts that best suits his style and tries to stay there.  He has been in several where he departed from his character style and was exceptional. I don't want to take anything away from him.  I think he has extraordinary character which is more valuable, in my opinion, than his acting.",

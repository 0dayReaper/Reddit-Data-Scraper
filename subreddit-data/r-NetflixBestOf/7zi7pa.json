Some people helped the Jews, some people would have helped them if the people in power that they let exist didn't hate the Jews. To be much more direct, does the Islamic God respect women as much as the Christian God respects women?  \n\nIslam and Christianity is rooted in misogyny, and you are sticking your head in the sand if you don't think Islam is part of the problem in Afghanistan. Decent human beings have stopped regression in the US, and from my understanding it was that way too in Iran, at least, before the US government fucked up the area. I understand that my government is a large part of the reason why extremists are a problem in Afghanistan and the area, but extremist isn't really a good term when they are just bringing society back inline with what their religious texts were based on. It's not like an all-powerful and all-knowing god has just coincidentally decided to be more socially conscious in recent history and changed his mind on these matters and it's the extremists who didn't get the brainwave signal to change their mind, and this is true for Islam and Christianity.   \n\n\"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but\u00a0they are commanded\u00a0to be under obedience, as also saith the law.\"\n\nYet this same Christian God has now recently decided that women can actually be priestesses nowadays in our enlightened society. Actually, the same God has also decided that gays shouldn't be stoned and can be can priests too. It's ludicrous to think that a religion isn't part of the problem when the religion is the only thing holding people back as the culture is the representation of the religion, and the religion can just change when convenient.  \n\nI haven't had a chance to watch this movie yet, but I want to. I am glad the movie depicts people standing up to tradition, but I decided to not be a Christian when I stopped following backwards Christian ways. Maybe both of our countries can do this and meet as friends and respect all people some day without sending bombs. P.S. if you are from the Middle East I am sorry for our president and his many terrible decisions including to pull back restrictions on killing civilians. He isn't our president and he is probably going to get impeached soon (and hopefully the GOP will fall with him).  \n\nEdit: Also \"extremists espousing fundamentalist views\" is kinda an oxymoron, and shows how cognitively dissonant it is to call these people extremists because they are following the basic fundamentals of a religion supposedly created by an all-knowing God.",

Up until that moment, the Oscars and Golden globes have been honored by all movie lovers and then they awarded Boss Baby a nomination.\n\nThe Golden Globes are a joke, they have been since day 1. The Oscars only matter because of the air of prestige around it. It is like the base line for movie discussion, most conversations are about whether you agree or disagree with them and that's the fun. Like the movies the award, they are subjective and open to interpretation. They are not infallible or the final word, they are the first word and nothing more. \n\nAny who, I'm glad Breadwinner got a nomination. That's 3/3 for Cartoon Saloon. Boss Baby was OK but not nearly worth the nomination. My picks would've been Loving Vincent, Coco, Lego Batman, and Mary and the Witches Flower. I would nominate Breadwinner, but I haven't seen it yet. Great to find it on Netflix, I'll definitely make time for it this weekend",

The voting blocks are almost entirely American, especially for the more technical categories. That is why Disney, Pixar and Dreamworks always get nominated because their own members vote for their own films. Only twice have non-American made films won (Curse of the Were-Rabbit and Howl's Moving Castle), which goes to show that regardless of who is nominated the home studio will always get the votes. This won't change until hundreds of new members are added that work for international studios. Another factor is Disney probably employs thousands of people, while Cartoon Saloon (The Breadwinner, Secret of Kells etc) probably only employ a few dozen main people. ",

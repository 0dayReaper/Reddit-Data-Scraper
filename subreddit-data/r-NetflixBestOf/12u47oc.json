To see some of those pivotal battles in color gives everything a much grittier perspective. There are two or three of these series on Netflix so I would recommend watching them all. \n\nNote: some of these might not be on Netflix, I\u2019m going off memory here",

In addition to what you mentioned, there's \"WW2 in Color: Road to Victory\" and \"Attack On Pearl Harbor: Minute by Minute\".\n\nAs far as movies go, The Forgotten Battle was decent.

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been really enjoying one specific narrator, but have been unable to find out who he is. \n\nHe seems to most often narrating a cheesy action movie (which is perfect for his style). For example, first discovered him narrating Doom 2005 (no longer of Netflix). \n\nIf you want to give him a listen, checkout the first 5 or 10 minutes of Resident Evil Afterlife.  It would be great to watch everything he's narrated.\n\nQuestion 1: does anyone know how to find out who narrates the audio description for a movie? I don\u2019t know if this is part of the movie production (and should be on IMDB), or if its something the streaming services pay to have created. \n\nQuestion 2: Any other audio description fans out there? And do you have any favorite movies or narrators?",

A familiar voice\r  \nThough it's an uncredited role, the first and last voice you hear in the film, providing narration, is none other than Jason Isaacs. Chances are you'll best remember him as portraying Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter movie franchise.\n\n[https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/resident-evil-movie-easter-eggs-27-references-and-things-you-missed-in-the-video-game-adaptation/2900-3637/](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/resident-evil-movie-easter-eggs-27-references-and-things-you-missed-in-the-video-game-adaptation/2900-3637/)",

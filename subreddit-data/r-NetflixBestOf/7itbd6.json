The wood is dense and hard and smooth, so the ignition point is stupid high - you basically light a fire with something else, then use that entire fire to light the Manzanita. And people mostly do this to get rid of shrubs that they've chopped out of their yard.\n\nWhy go to all this trouble? Because it burns like uranium and butane. It's legendary hot. You can have a \"small\" fire that you can't get closer than ten feet from. There's something satisfying about that.",

    "postText": "**Honourable Mentions:**\n\nAnikulapo\n\nBeauty\n\nBlonde\n\nChoose or Die\n\nDay Shift\n\nDo Revenge\n\nEnola Holmes 2\n\nThe Gray Man\n\nHello, Goodbye, and Everything in Between\n\nLou\n\nThe Man from Toronto\n\nMother/Android\n\nMr. Harrigan\u2019s Phone\n\nOld People\n\nPersuasion\n\nSpiderhead\n\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre\n\nTroll\n\nThe Weekend Away\n\nWindfall\n\nThe Wonder\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10. **White Noise**\n\nA relatively odd apocalyptic-type dark comedy backed up by a downright oddly fun performance from Adam Driver. The way things turned out as the story progressed almost had me baffled but was great to sit through. The closing credit sequence was fun, well-shot and well-choreographed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9. **All Quiet at the Western Front**\n\nIts horrifically realistic depiction of World War I, along with the sad reality the enthusiastic protagonists had to go through as the war progressed made this a thrilling-but-saddening war flick. The battle sequences were impressive and at the same time frightening. And I also enjoyed watching the subplot of the treaty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8. **Hustle**\n\nYet another reason why Adam Sandler should do dramatic films more frequently. Its plot doesn't differentiate much from other sports films, but it was a fun character arc for both Sandler and Hernangomez that intrigued me from start to finish. There was even a great blend of comedy. Man, was Ben Foster's character hateable!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7. **The Adam Project**\n\nA pretty fun action-time-travel film that might've suited for a theatrical release. I have to give major kudos to the child actor, as he actually felt like a younger version of Ryan Reynolds. To my surprise, there were also some well-written emotional moments for the protagonists and a satisfyingly touching ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. **Wendell &amp; Wild**\n\nKey &amp; Peele are still a dynamic duo, even when just lending their voices. I feel stop-motion animation isn't being made as frequently as it should be, as it brings a great touch of dark-toned stories like this one. The lead protagonist was likable, and the concept had its own interesting presentation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. **The Good Nurse**\n\nEdgy, dark, and heavily fueled by the performances of Chastain and the creepy Redmayne. As certain mysteries unravelled, things got pretty heart-pounding pretty fast. On a side note, I didn't know this was a true story until reading the epilogue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. **Matilda the Musical**\n\nAn uplifting musical with a stylish take on the story's narrative. Much kudos goes to the catchy scores and choreography. Alisha Weir was adorable as the titular character, and I loved the mother-daughter chemistry between her and Lynch. But the biggest draw was Emma Thompson as Trunchball, who was more intimidating and crazier than in the original adaptation. The ending was emotionally touching as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. **Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery**\n\nWithout going into spoilers, this is easily better than the first film. Daniel Craig was brilliant, and the supporting cast was phenomenal (especially Norton and Monae). The humour was drop-dead funny and the mystery, OMG; nothing less than luring all the way through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. **Pinocchio**\n\nDel Toro presented a significant take on the classic story, giving a gothically dark-toned but wonderfully imaginative film that makes me think stop-motion should be more of a thing. The film had its hard, saddening moments but with it also came some encouraging moments. I also have to give kudos to the fresh design of the adorable protagonist and its pretty surprising ending that gives a different spin to the classic story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **The Sea Beast**\n\nOne of my top pleasant surprises of all time, and my current favourite Netflix film. Along with its enchanting animation and sense of adventure, it takes the concept of Moby Dick and gives a different spin, subtly reflecting on discrimination and propaganda. And the voice cast all had their charms, most notably newcomer Zaris-Angel Hator. It feels like this could be on par with many Disney Animated Classics.",

We just finished Schitts Creek, which was an excellent show because the network making it saw the quality in it and allowed it to grow into its stellar reception. We are binging a few of the shows and movies that aren't on any other service for the rest of the month and then we are canceling. At first I want going to, because I my thinking was that they aren't giving these shows a chance and while that didn't really sit with me, I wasn't so bothered by it. But then I realized, they are actually wasting my time with these shows. Like, I would never see a movie and just leave halfway through even though I wasn't enjoying it, and then never ever finish that movie. That would be a total waste of my time. Not going to waste any more time on Netflix. Unlike other networks, like Pop or HBO, they aren't putting in the kind of extra effort that deserves my time, money or attention.",

Netflix is not traditional TV, the strength of their catalogue is a major selling point and in a few years that catalogue will be filled with shows that end abruptly with no satisfying conclusion - which would make me unlikely to take the plunge and watch them. \nIf a show like Glow isn't delivering the numbers then they should allow the writers a few more episodes or a movie to wrap up the story so it can live in the Netflix library as a complete product. \n\nThe new head if original content seems to be a fan of reality TV (Love is blind etc) which will not age well.",

No they don\u2019t and no it doesn\u2019t!\n\nThey used to pride themselves on saying they don\u2019t operate like traditional network channels, and they were even known for SAVING shows other shows cancelled halfway through. \n\nNow they\u2019ve done an about face and are cancelling anything they please with no regard at all for fans of those shows. They have the money to let those shows have some sort of conclusion. The new head is obviously an idiot who has no regard for viewers and is very short sighted, thinking only about what makes them more money in the immediate future and not long term. They are now operating just like a traditional network with cancellations. \n\nThe stupid thing is they don\u2019t even need to be. Networks have to cancel low rated shows to make space on their schedule to make more ad money. Netflix has no restrictions on space or schedules and they have beaucoups of money to do what they like. They\u2019re just now trying to maximise short term profit over everything else. \n\nIt\u2019s so dumb because they\u2019re creating so much Ill will and leaving their exclusive catalogue full of half finished shows. It\u2019s like mind bogglingly dumb. It makes most sense to let a show have a final season to wrap things up if they want to cancel it, but even if they\u2019re obsessing over costs, then at least let a show have a final movie or few eps or hell even just one final ep to wrap the damn show up so there\u2019s a conclusion. There\u2019s absolutely no reason why they can\u2019t do that and that they\u2019re not just shows such a boneheaded level of incompetence and mismanagement.",

Santa Clarita Diet was my first burn and it's been downhill ever since.  \n\nI literally thought to myself after a couple episodes of Teenage Bounty Hunters, well, it's a cute, unique, witty show....Guess Netflix will cancel it. And I remember thinking it probably wasn't even worth watching rhe rest of the episodes and getting to know any of the characters.   \n\nWhat is the fucking point Netflix???",

Human intuition has its place. Additionally, the algorithm seems to be only focused on short term success. Whereas they should be focused on 10, 20, even 50 years into the future where the content created today can be content seen in the future. Bugs Bunny shows come to mind, as well as shows like Sherlock Holmes starring Jeremy Brett from the 1980\u2019s (on BritBox). Netflix is way too short sighted. \n\nOne thing I try to remember is that there is a new graduating class every year. A new show to them may be an old show to me.",

More people will just wait to see what takes off. And personally, if I'm already in the middle of one or two shows, I will wait until I finish one to start another.

Maybe offer a bundle deal for popular channels that can be streamed one place on netflix, instead of hopping from app to app. But right now with very little \u2018mainstream\u2019 shows and movies being offered on netflix, they are going to have a hard time keeping up.",

Beef has more grounded, emotional depth whilst patriot opts for more elaborate storytelling which it then relates to normal everyday life.

It\u2019s a funny, semi unique recreation of a common trope, so falling on the same list as something like parasite is a little out of place to me.",

Do they maybe have overlapping topics of things analyzed/portrayed such as the effects ones cultural background has on one\u2019s life (ie being white trash in shameless or the nuances of being Asian American in beef) or family dysfunction? sure, but to say it\u2019s a spin off is an unrealistic stretch.",

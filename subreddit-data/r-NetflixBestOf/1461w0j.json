    "postText": "Looking back at one of my favorite LGBT Netflix shows.\n\nDespite having an interesting concept, I went into this show with low expectations. Turns down, this show was much more lovable than anticipated that I finished the entire season in just one day!\n\nThe most prominent kudos to the performances of the two young leads and their chemistry, which was obviously the most alluring part of the series. I went in thinking their romance is gonna be completely forced and even unconvincing. Turns out there was a natural setup behind them getting together, and even then, there was a lot of rockiness behind their relationship, largely due to the massive complications between their families, which of course gives \"Romeo &amp; Juliet\" vibes.\n\nThere were also some emotional moments between the families, especially during the season finale when people were forced to make hard choices.\n\nI won't pretend that this show didn't have flaws. It did.  It\u2019s low-budget CGI was laughable and there were some blood splatters that looked like something you'd see in a student film. Probably a good thing they kept the visual effects to a minimum. Also, certain concepts it wasn\u2019t very clear on, making some narratives confusing.\n\nFor me, its heartbreaking cliffhanger undoubtedly has me disheartened the show got cancelled.",

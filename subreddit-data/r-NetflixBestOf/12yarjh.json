Just goes to show you how horrendously people can treat  each other. It made me see Paris in a new light. I don't think it's on Netflix though. Was adapted from a novel. \n\nAlso, The Killing Fields and First, They Killed My Father. They hit extra hard for me because my mom's friend's family had siblings who died in the Cambodian labor camps of starvation. Like the scene in the first movie, my mom's friend fell asleep escaping through the jungle and woke up to find herself in a field of dead bodies. \n\nThe Flowers of War (2011, with Christian Bale) about the Rape of Nanking during WW2.  My great uncle was trampled by horses ridden by invading Japanese solders and died shortly after. \n\nGrave of the Fireflies - also mentioned - is also good but very sad. About the effects of war on children. \n\nA lot of war movies concentrate on the fighters but I really feel for the civilians who are often caught between the 2 sides. This includes people on the losing side (e.g. ordinary Germans during WW2) who might not have supported authoritarian regimens and just wanted to live their lives but were forced to go along and die, suffer, etc.",

I also recently learned about [Anzac biscuits and Gallipoli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NEyzsxjc2w) via one of my favorite Youtube Channels, which combines cooking and history. \n\nI actually have several friends and colleagues who live in Oz and NZ so I really should know more about this history. My second cousin graduated from dental school in Sydney. It's not really dark per se but Peter Jackson's They Shall Not Grow Old was amazing. We saw it in the theater when it came out.  It really brought home the point that many soldiers in WW1 were just ordinary, young boys.",

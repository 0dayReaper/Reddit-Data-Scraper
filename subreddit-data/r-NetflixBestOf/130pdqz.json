If you watch the whole thing then say it was overrated or didn\u2019t do it for you that\u2019s fine but how can you call a show overrated and say you only watched 2-3eps? That\u2019s just dumb imo. Especially the people saying Breaking Bad. Everyone\u2019s entitled to their opinion but some of these opinions are just too uninformed. Cmon people!",

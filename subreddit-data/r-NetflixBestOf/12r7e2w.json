Dedicate an episode or two to \u00c6thelstan struggling with his feelings, turning to the brotherhood, Ingulmundr being sent as a spy to find his weaknesses, finding the biggest one, seducing him, *then* we have a small time skip to Edward dying.\n\nDuring those two first episodes we could have also established Young Uthred's journey to Rome, Stiorra's death, and whatever happened to all our other favorites that didn't really have a role in SKMD.\n\nI would have also preferred to see a lot less teleporting.",

A king that could have had anyone, never took a wife? He was also known for decorating his hair with golden ringlets. No king was going to have it written \"hey, I'm gay btw\" on the chronicle of their life regardless of what their preferences may have been. Bernard Cornwell decided to make \u00c6thelstan gay based on these details of his life. He might not have been gay, but him being gay doesn't contradict any historical facts known about him.\n\nAlso, I disagree about the plot being better without it. Without it, \u00c6thelstan has no faith crisis. Unlike Alfred, he's only intimate with one person, so his \"sin\" is homosexuality. He wants to be \"cured\" and forgiven for it desperately. Simultaneously, he's easily manipulated into believing Aldhelm is spreading rumors about his secret. \u00c6thelstan's sexuality, soft heart, and his deep faith clashing are the main drivers behind his actions.\n\nRegarding Uhtred, he was *supposed* to be quite old. 70+. It's what the scene where he is robbed of his sword tries to show. He's older and slower. In the end, he is mortally wounded (imo) and survives just long enough to fulfill his oath to \u00c6thelstan \u2013 both giving his lands and protecting his secret by making him swear to produce no heirs.\n\n100% agree. It would have been beautiful to see Uhtred with his loved ones once more. Unfortunately, the actors that weren't in the film simply couldn't show up due to other work engagements.\n\nSorry for the ramble.",

By the end of the final season I got the impression that his character loved and admired Uhtred. \n\nThe movie gave a different impression. It was as though the writer woke up and said, \u201cWho else can I have betray or disappoint Uhtred today?\u201d That\u2019s just how it felt to me (making him gay and then so pious as to make him behave unwisely out of self hatred/shame) \u2014 like a plot device and nothing more.

I was awarded \"Regent of the Seas\" which was 2nd place out of all 20 men and women combined. I actually won way more categories than were shown on TV. There was limited space and they had to fit 7 days of competition into one episode. I had the highest score for best National Costume, the highest score for both Question 1 and Question 2 for the 2 question on stage interview, highest score for formal wear, and highest score for runway overall. The California contestant had the highest score for poolside personality, Indonesia had the best underwater, and Luna Marie from Florida had the best Swimwear. As a note the Talent portion was optional and NOT judged as part of the overall score. I was also the only one of the 20 that makes their own tails but that wasn't factored into the scores.",

Per the rules of the competition I can't go into too many details but there was some weighting done to some categories making some wins worth less and others worth more. You can see specific percentages on the King and Queen of the Sea website. There was also as shown on the show potential mistakes in calculations. Many factors that were showcased were not part of formal scoring. Like talent was optional and not part of the final scores (this was due to constraints of licensing music, shipping equipment across the country, etc. Basically all contestants were cool with this choice since it was so complicated. Those who showcased a talent actually gave everyone else more time to change outfits so it was used like an intermission which was really cool.) All tails were treated equally, so even though I made my own tail with 8,000 hand stitched sequins and custom silicone work that didn't have any effect on score. Someone who could purchase a $5k tail and someone with a $50 tail were treated the same. My personal take is that this doesn't foster creativity. I was the only one with a sewing kit and the knowledge and ability to repair both fabric and silicone tails for other contestants (which happened a few times).  This does however even the financial playing field for those of means and those who may be less able to afford high price tails. Like the materials for my sequin tail with silicone fin was less than $500 but I put in 40 to 60 hours of work to make it. \n\nThe congeniality award did not bother me in any way. It wasn't something any of us knew was happening and it was a surprise. Blix is a really nice, vibrant guy, he also stood up for unfairness. The saying goes \"What do you call a group of mermaids?\" answer is \"Drama\". When there was drama Blix stood up and defended people. He is someone that stands behind what he believes in and when he sees something he doesn't think is right you best believe he will call it as he sees it. I didn't think I would like him as much as I did and I did apologize to him for unfairly judging him in the past. When he showed me who he was in person, that is a man I respect and can stand behind.",

There was a lot of death and destruction.  \n\nI think it was responsible to postpone. 10 days after that Ian wasn\u2019t when florida needed people coming to visit and taking up hotel rooms that displaced people, or out of state rescue workers/organizers or out of state power workers may have needed. \n\nPlus it wasn\u2019t just their reunion\u2014it was to celebrate the park in general. What if they expected that a lot of Floridians from different parts of the state might have wanted to attend the 75th anniversary?\n\nDoesn\u2019t make sense to have the anniversary during a time when people couldn\u2019t make it, or worse encourage people to drive through areas that were potentially flooded on their way to get to weeki.",

Some of the personalities shown were exhausting and I genuinely could not stand a single person from the main cast except for Sparkles by the end of it. The attention-seeking behavior was getting to be too much for me.  \n\n\nI really liked the Weeki Wachee mermaid queen's fashion sense, Sparkles, also thought Morgana had an interesting background, and uhh that was about it.  \n\n\nI noticed during the competition part they briefly focused on this lady who was talking about how her costume was entirely made up of plastics found in the local waters. And I wish they focused more on that side of things.",

They also kept showing her face looking displeased or smug(?) in moments when Sparkles was really struggling. Did anyone else catch this? It\u2019s possible the film crew was trying to give the blonde girl a \u201cvillain edit\u201d since Ch\u00e9 told us previously that the Circus Siren Pod were the \u201cmean girls\u201d of the mermaid world. But it just seemed like every interaction we saw between her and Sparkles was super awkward and tense; it honestly gave me flashbacks to my early twenties when I worked as a flight attendant and would end up on trips with super stuck up mean girls. At the end I noticed that when Sparkles got hired full time the blonde girl came up to her and gave her a big hug, so maybe I was mistaken?? Tell me I\u2019m not the only one who noticed this.",

The mermaid from her team that shows the most skill is Mermaid Michelle who is a competitive swimmer. \n\nThe reason Mertailor probably doesn't travel is likely priced based. I've done hotel shows in large aquariums and a GOOD booking rate for 3 dives a day, 20 minutes each is $500 to $1,000 and it is usually only two performers. If you factor in hotel and airfare it really doesn't make much sense. It's probably better to be a destination than a travel team.",

It's really normal for aquatic performers to hug each other for warmth or just to tuck away so the public can't see you resting.

From there sparkle was at the top not swimming anymore. It\u2019s as if sparkle went down once, did the little window to window thing with the kid and then was too cold to continue. Was she there for more, probably. But I don\u2019t think she made the 20 minute swim set out by Morgana.\n\nI\u2019m not impressed with sparkle. She had numerous breakdowns. If I was the employer like Morgana I don\u2019t know if I would want a somewhat unreliable, need to be baby sat and coached to go swim, employee. \n\nI get she is a more novice mermaid compared to the others, and I did like her story and drive/passion. But she definitely appeared more as someone that should be doing it as a hobby and not professionally. At least in this setting. She might do better in a warm tank without fish.

Those of us like Hannah, Kariel, Luna Marie, myself, and the other coastal merfolk have a much easier time training.

Elite \"mermaids and mermen\" are stunt divers. We swim with large animals,  dive mask free, and can make open ocean scenes beautiful. Hannah, Kariel, and Singapore mermaid are considered elite mermaids. We didn't see the pinnacle of the field enough. What was showcased was people trying and failing to be like them. I wish we could have seen the elite coaching the newer performers.",

Every outfit you saw including my sequin tail which I hand stitched was made within a week. I had to call in every favor I had to pull together outfits. What was on tv is only a piece of the work. I was also the only competitor that created every piece of their outfits for the competition specifically.",

Going into the show I knew what to expect and I have helped a lot of pageant competitors with their looks so I had the benefit of calling on a community to assist. My national costume was designed by a good friend in the Hawaiian community who is a Kumu Hula. My suit was custom made for the show by a friend who is a theater costumer. I literally paid her to take two days off of work and the night before I flew out we stayed up until 6 in the morning hand stitching detail work onto it together. My swimwear look which wasn't shown was actually a tear away piece with a reveal moment and a custom seahorse speedo that the company HAC Swim Canada made for me a few years back when I helped them showcase their line. Every piece I had was crafted with intention and with the help of someone in my life that has been there when I needed them.",

This was tame by comparison I guess.\n\nI'm with you though. It would be absolutely exhausting if every person thought they needed to share their negative opinion on a topic just for the sole sake of voicing disapproval.. **without adding anything useful to the conversation**.  Like, just move on.  If every person felt the need to declare \"not for me\" whenever they ran into something that wasn't targeted for them this sub would be absolute garbage.",

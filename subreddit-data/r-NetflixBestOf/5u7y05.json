I believe they say \"buddies\" disease instead.\nAlthough I'm aware this joke may he insensitive to those with said disability, I believe the movie should remain unaltered. Similar to old movies with racial slurs or scenarios that wouldn't work in todays movies/tv \n\nAnybody know more about this? ",

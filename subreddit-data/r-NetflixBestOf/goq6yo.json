Each episode is fanatastic on a self contained basis, but they also play an amazing role in the overarching story. The characters and the world take amazing twists and turns, but is always riveting to watch.",

My brother was the right age for late-90s Nick, and I got a kick out of SpongeBob, but yeah, not being a young kid made a lot of the original shows from that time fall a little flat.\n\nIt's hard to separate the time from the content. Nickelodeon was a very different network, and without it I would never have seen a huge variety of kids content from around the world. It was pretty mind-blowing to watch cartoons from the UK, France, Japan, and Canada as a kid in 1988 North Dakota.\n\nI just started watching Avatar, and I like it a lot.",

At the end, it's the character development that people really love. \n\nBy S01E04 (\"Warriors of Kyoshi\"), the basic themes of the show have been established, and if you still have zero interest at that point I'd say leave it for another day.  If you get through S01E08 (Winter Solstice) and you aren't dying to know what happens next, then the show probably isn't for you.  It gets a *lot* better as it goes on, but that doesn't mean much if the basic structure isn't compelling to you.",

It was rushed and would\u2019ve probably turned out better if the writers knew they were going to have more seasons.\n\nThe 2nd season also suffered because they partially rolled back character development that had happened in the first season so that, I\u2019m assuming, it could happen in a better pace.\n\nThe 3rd and 4th seasons are just as good as any season of ATLA.\n\nIf you loved ATLA, you should watch all of LoK when it is available.",

I was so sad that I was missing it because Nickelodeon really sold it as an event not to be missed \u2014 the hype was real. Luckily the family friend had cable and I was able to catch the episodes in real time. So lucky! I\u2019ll never forget that.",

ATLA is the best example of a show being animated and rated for general audiences and still not being \"just a silly children's show\".",

The live action version that Netflix did doesn\u2019t hold a candle to the original anime. \nBebop is easily one of the best short story animes of all time. I have used it to introduce people who swore they hated anime to the genre and next thing you know they are watching all kinds of anime!!!! \nThere\u2019s definitely no better place to start!!! Space cowboy bounty hunters!!! With an incredible soundtrack and the best voice actors of the past 30 years!!! Can\u2019t beat it",

Also, Dr. Stone, Mushoku Tensei and Cells at Work if you're into less intense anime. \n\nSorry, long comment. I got excited. \ud83d\ude05\n\nAttack on Titan. is dystopian, dark fantasy where humanity is at war with titans and humans are losing. They're enclosed in 3 layers of walls the protect themselves. Then one day, the outer wall was breached. People have mixed opinions about this especially with the ending, but you can decide whether this is a masterpiece for you or not. \n\nTrigun is set on an post-apocalyptic, futuristic world where a guy with a bounty on his head is trying to escape his bounty hunters while he suffers from a terrible past. Then you'll find out he has a twin gone rouge, borderline crazy brother who our guy will try to stop. 1st ver. has more humour (or an attempt of) 2nd version has better animation but they seemed to have stripped this  version of humor.\n\nNurarihyon no Mago, 2 seasons of Yakuza meets Yokai.  A boy who is the grandson of a pure-blooded, strongest entity of the spiritual realm. (aka, strongest yokai) But the boy is only 1/4 yokai and he wants to live a normal life. He doesn't want to take over his grandpa's legion but he can only run from responsibility for so long. My only complain about this one is the protag's rise to peak power isn't animated. \n\n\nDr. Stone is a reset on humanity, meaning, we are back into sticks and stones era. Humanity found themselves petrified/calcified into stones and only a genius and his friend, a strong guy awakened.  Now they're set to rebuild civilization from scratch. \n\nMushoku Tensei is a reincarnation type. A jobless, \"loser\" person was hit by a truck and died and got transported to this another world where he was born with magic and his past life memory still intact. Now, he wants to live the right way. \n\nCells at Work is an adventure to our own bodies. Our cells are depicted as characters and the story follows the things going on in our bodies. Like when we cut ourselves, it's represented by big explosions, white blood cells killing germs/bacs etc. There's 2 version of this: a healthy body and the struggling one. The latter ver is much more intense.",

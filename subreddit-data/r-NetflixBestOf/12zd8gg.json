    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI need your help! For my thesis, I am conducting research about the nonlinear storytelling approach in the Netflix show *Kaleidoscope* (2023). I created a survey to determine whether watching the episodes in any order you like encourages viewer engagement.\n\nTherefore, I was wondering if there are any *Kaleidoscope* (2023) viewers out there who could help me. Please share your opinions about the show with me through my survey! Completing the survey takes approximately 5 minutes. Please find the link attached below:\n\n[https://nl.surveymonkey.com/r/5X5FJDC](https://nl.surveymonkey.com/r/5X5FJDC) (new link!)\n\nThank you so much in advance! If you have any further questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\n\\#Kaleidoscope #Kaleidoscopenetflix #kaleidoscopetvseries #kaleidoscopeshow",

So like Orange XX before the hiest or whatever.",

Every question seems pointed at the non-linear structure of the show, so I'll just answer you here - I didn't think it really added or subtracted anything from the show.\n\nThe show wasn't hard to follow in either case, I didn't have any trouble putting the events together. But I never really got the impression that there was anything special about the show that made it work non-chronologically. \n\nAs long as the cast of characters is consistent between episodes, I feel like I can watch most shows out of order and have a similar experience. I don't really understand what they did differently in Kaleidoscope that makes them feel like it's specifically tailored to be watched out of order.\n\nOverall I thought the show was decent, but despised the ending. I don't think nonlinearity factored into my enjoyment at all - positive or negative.",

            "comment": "I filled out your survey, but I wanted to suggest an edit. Perhaps there should be a question asking if people watched the show in linear order or out of order. If watched out of order then they can proceed to answer questions of a particular section of the questionnaire, such as whether we were more invested and such. I watched the show in order, so I had to select strongly disagree on a lot of questions but it was simply because I watched the show in chronological order so to strongly agree on any options would have been false. Does that make sense?\n\nSo my answers were based on the merits of the question and not the merits of the non-linear order, which I would suspect was the actual point. So if watched in chronological order then participants should not answer questions in the said section.",

    "postText": "[**Part 7** 52 Horror Thriller and Sci-Fi Films Worth Watching](https://imgur.com/a/IDx4Xeb)  \n  \nI've done several of these over the years and they (generally) seem to be well-received and appreciated, especially on this subreddit and /r/movies so here is the seventh part in an increasingly random collection of movies.   \n  \nI try to leave off the big, well-known titles, this is more for lesser known, recent genre films.\n\nLinks to previous entries in this series:  \n  \n[**Part 1** 57 Horror Thriller and Sci-Fi Films](http://imgur.com/a/hROjx)  \n  \n[**Part 2** Another 57 Horror, Thriller and Sci-Fi Films](http://imgur.com/a/a2JJu)  \n  \n[**Part 3** 60 More Indie Horror, Thriller and Sci-Fi Films](https://imgur.com/a/DbkB6p0)  \n   \n**SIDE NOTE: The First Three Albums are on an old Imgur account I've been locked out of, I know the titles don't show up depending on what browser type you might be using.**  I will re-do these on my new Imgur account eventually but for the time being, you can always plug the description of any into Google and it will show up since the descriptions are copied from IMDb.    \n  \n[**Part 4** Yet another 59 Horror, Thriller and Indie Sci-Fi Films Worth Watching](https://imgur.com/a/4olS5Z1) \n \n  \n[**Part 5** 58 More Indie Horror, Thriller and Sci-Fi Films Worth Watching](https://imgur.com/gallery/vvJkAu5) \n \n  \n[**Part 6** 63 More Indie Horror, Thriller and Sci-Fi Films Worth Watching](https://imgur.com/gallery/6bikMmj)\n  \nAnd I know not every person is going to like every film listed, these are just ones that I've enjoyed for one reason or another.  \n  \nAlso I don't personally use Letterboxd but at one point someone did create a playlist for all my recommendations that does contain the first 5 albums.  I don't think it has Album 6 and obviously not this most recent one.  \n  \n[7thKing's Letterboxd Album of Squid_Fucker's recommendations](https://letterboxd.com/7thking/list/r-squid_fuckers-list/)",

I tried for a while but couldn't get back in so I just made a new account and continued where I left off.    \n  \nI've been meaning to copy all the albums over, it's the only thing on that Imgur account anyway (there might be an album of Uncharted 4 screenshots too lol) but I just haven't taken the time.     \n  \n   \nTruthfully, I wasn't going to do any more of these albums at all but I got two messages in the last few days from super old posts on reddit thanking me for doing the albums and I thought that was really cool and it inspired me to think back on the last year and what I've seen and would recommend.     \n  \nThese lists are always just off the top of my head so I know I'm forgetting a lot that I've seen but I think it's a good starting point for someone who is looking to start expanding their viewing habits beyond just the 15-25 big name films that get all the attention every year.",

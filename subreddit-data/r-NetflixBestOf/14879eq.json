Its funny and lighthearted. The first episode is about him uncovering the secrets of a family that doesnt age. &gt;! The family sleeps in tupperware at night !&lt;",

It's hard to recommend because of the third season, but it's one of my favorites. They knew they were getting canceled so they tried to pack like four seasons of story into one. And you can just watch their budget run out in real time. It's kind of silly but you do get the full story and I respect that they tried. \n\nBut if you're willing to forgive that, it's two great seasons of mystery thriller and one season of a production crew trying their damndest against a studio that's trying to ruin them, which is fun in it's own way.",

Blue Velvet probably matches Twin Peaks tone the most, but Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive are also excellent. Lynch really likes themes of darkness underlying seemingly idyllic places and he uses surrealism often. If you don't like those movies, Twin Peaks probably isn't for you either.",

(and cocreator Mark Frost ofc) \n\nTwin Peaks was also the first \"prestige\" television show ever, with an overarching plot. At the time it was all syndicated episodic formula, think like OG or Next Gen Star Trek, where you can basically jump in at any point. Twin Peaks did away with that, and you had to watch each episode in order to get the story.\n\nIt's not for everyone. It has silly moments and of course it gets extremely surreal and weird. But it's a fantastic supernatural mystery, blending quirky and seemingly idealic rural people with true evil, and how that shakes up a small town and effects everyone in it. It gets grim as fuck, especially in the movie and The Return (the third season that aired 25 years after the original). It's also just wonderfully acted, and very charming.",

I am glad I stuck through Twin Peaks just because it is such a cultural touchpoint. It really did change TV and was revolutionary for it's time. It was built on the framework of a soap opera because they were kind of the only model for serialized TV at the time. So it ended up being a soap opera that turns into a surreal horror and it's definitely something unique and special for that.\n\nAfter you're done, treat yourself to the Twin Peaks episode of Psych and see if you can count all the references. It's so good.",

It's also got Seinfeld syndrome where just because it was the *first* doesn't mean it still holds up. If you watched Twin Peaks in the 90s you were watching something incredible.\n\n2023 Twin Peaks is... I mean.\n\nThe other guy said it's the greatest show ever so maybe I'm just a contrarian but I think Twin Peaks is kinda lame. Great intro though.\n\nIf you want to watch Twin Peaks \"but better\" imo watch either Fargo or True Detective. Both shows are mysteries in a small community with a tight cast and a tighter script.",

A few things I thought it did well and nothing else I've seen as come close (and this is mainly talking about the time before Lynch left the show):\n\n1. Sense of unease.  Everyone is fucking weird, it's like the entire town is some sort of Lovecraftian horror and nobody feels safe.  \n2. Genuine horror.  Certain shots are legitimately nightmare inducing.  \n3. Great acting.  Perhaps needless to say, everyone's performances are expertly crafted throughout.  \n4. Great music.  The soundtrack is an absolute banger.  \n5. Unpredictable plot.  Counts for a lot when so many shows are cookie-cutter, especially the murder mysteries.  \n6. Mystic/Cosmic Supernatural elements.  And unlike your X-files, Buffy, your big Fantasy shows like The Witcher, or Warehouse 13, the sense of mysticism in Twin Peaks feels much more Lovecraftian.  That sort of 'unknowable' spookiness where you're not even sure if it's real in the setting.\n7. Great characters.  I mean, basically every character is incredibly unique and memorable.  Are there other characters in media like Leeland Palmer?  Dale Cooper?  The Log Lady?  Outside of media that is directly attempting to recreate or give homage to Twin Peaks, such as the game Deadly Premonition/Alan Wake, not really.",

I really enjoyed the initial mystery and the reveal. Station Eleven did this well. The show told a story and wrapped it up nicely. Very good and very satisfying. I think a lot of productions try to stay open-ended so they can do more seasons and the story suffers.",

This was supposed to be a one season mini-series, but it got so much hype that they decided to do a second season, but couldn't get all the same actors, and it kinda messed up some of the plots that were happening.",

I was wondering if perhaps he got arrested under suspicion (but later released) due to preparation for the role or due to changes in his behavior due to the role. Arrest does not mean conviction in many (most?) cases, so i wasn't sure if he actually became a dealer.\n\nThat's quite interesting, thanks for the article! It seems that he was already into petty crime before police suspected him of drug running and murder. That article doesn't mention that he was arrested, though it mentions that he's on a most wanted list, so he's potentially still at large.",

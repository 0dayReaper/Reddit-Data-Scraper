            "comment": "\"It's Such a Beautiful Day\"   \nIt's an independent film by Don Hertzfeldt (who you may remember from those viral stick-figure animations titled \"Rejected\".  When they first came out, everyone between the ages of 11 and 25 were quoting it constantly.  \"My spoon is too big\", \"My anus is bleeding\", \"I am a baNAna!\" etc.)  \nThe movie definitely still shows Hertzfeldt's signature style; but it isn't a comedy film (despite some moments being really funny)  \nBasically it follows Bill, a normal guy who has some undefined, degenerative brain disease.  \nThe story is told as a series of vignettes, animated in Hertzfeldt's familiar stick figure style, with Don himself narrating Bill's life in 3rd person.  \nI would have thought that the stick figure art style would detract from such serious subject matter but it actually works really really well.  It gives the vibe that Bill's experience is kind of detached and sketchy.\n\nAnyway, this is one of the most poignant movies I have ever seen and I recommend it to anyone who I think might like it.  \n\nThe movie was released as 3 short films, about 15-25 minutes each.  They are titled:   \n\"Everything Will Be OK\" (2006)  \n\"I am So Proud of You\" (2008) and  \n\"It's Such a Beautiful Day\" (2011)\n\nThen, the 3 short films were combined into the movie that is also called \"It's Such a Beautiful Day\" (2012)  \nSo if you are looking for the movie, make sure the length is around an hour.\n\nIf you want to watch the first 1/3rd of the movie, it is up on YouTube here:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IUX0Qy-IDM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IUX0Qy-IDM)\n\nIf I can find the streaming link for the full film, I will link it here as well.  Because everyone should see this movie.",

This whole movie is not a tear jerker - but I feel I must share, if not just to give you your wish, but to warn other unsuspecting movie watchers out there.\n\nI\u2019m not a big cryer. Not on purpose. My heart aches and I love all story lines. I\u2019m empathetic. Promise. Prefer scifi, horror and action - but doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t appreciate a heart tugger.\n\nI had never seen John Wick. Now my husband said this was a cardinal sin being an action fan, plus Keanu Reeves is a literal National treasure. Just like puppies and cute babies; we don\u2019t deserve him.\n\nAnyways - to make a very short story super long - the beginning of John Wick had me bawling. My husband paused the movie to comfort me and was so caught off guard seeing me cry that he looked visibly shaken. \n\nBe warned. \n\nThat being said. The movies rock. But I\u2019m sorry\u2026 &gt;!don\u2019t hurt animals and don\u2019t hurt children!&lt; \u2026then I won\u2019t have a problem. Just like I couldn\u2019t finish breaking bad once &gt;!gale was killed!&lt;.. my heart is more tender than it appears. \n\nGood luck on your crying endeavors.",

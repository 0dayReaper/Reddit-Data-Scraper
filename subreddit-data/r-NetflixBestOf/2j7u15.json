It makes you think.\n\nGravity is 100% about the senses. I'm not sure if you watched it in theatres, but the combination of the visuals and the audio created an experience unlike any other film I've ever seen.\n\nGravity's story line was OK. Moon's story line was phenomenal.  \nMoon's visuals were OK. Gravity's visuals were phenomenal.\n\nBasically I think both movies accomplished what they set out to accomplish very well, and I wouldn't want either to be more like the other.\n\n",

How they made the sets so they could film 360 degrees, and the blending between the 'real' footage and CGI green-screen stuff is fascinating. A lot of more of it was CG than I would have expected. \n\nIts been on Netflix before, then dropped off. This is one of the rare movies that I'll buy on DVD to re-watch even if Netflix drops is again. \n\nBTW: Ive never thought of Sam Rockwell as a 'top tier' actor, but he did a great job with this!",

I went to see this movie in the theater with a friend of mine, I was so excited. Hardcore SciFi film, with miniatures instead of solid cgi, character driven instead of spectacle? Sign me up.\n\nSooooo disappointed. 15 minutes in I thought to myself \"if the end twist is Rockwell is [spoilers] I am going to be so pissed, they are practically telegraphing that.\" It's not that seeing it coming is even a bad thing, if they hadn't hung the entire movie off that one premise.\n\nAside from that, the movie is otherwise predictable. Given the premise of meeting an identical you, I am already expecting: The mental breakdown scene, The rejection of reality scene, The argument/fight scene, The running away scene, The uncovering the truth scene, The coming together scene, The sacrifice scene... Pretty much all of those showed up, and during them I was bored. More or less siting in the theater thinking \"OK... Move on... get to something new... I am done with this... show me something different already!\"\n\nRockwell does a decent job acting, but the dialog is forced and unnatural. Pacing is inconsistent, and the movie jumps around so much for a while I thought they were heading towards a non linear time twist. Which, would have been a much more interesting premise and better 'twist' IMO. But, since that wasn't the case, it just muddled things. It's as if the story really captured the writers or directors imagination, and they saw a much deeper more revelatory experience in their head than what ended up on screen.\n\nThe movie isn't *bad*, in fact as far as modern SciFi goes, it's pretty good in comparison to most drek that comes out these days. It is, however, certainly not the cinematic masterpiece, all-that-and-a-bag-of-chips Reddit routinely hails it as.\n\nIt's good acting, a good score, good cinematography (aside for the weird scene jumping), hampered by mediocre dialog, odd pacing, and generally trying to hit above its weight class.",

There really wasn't much of a story at all, to be honest. I'm trying to think of things to talk about, but there's really nothing there. I remember Sandra Bullock's character being whiny, annoying, and stupid, but I can't recall any specific examples. Also George Clooney's character was just an idiot, but that's partially due to the non-physical universe that he lived in.\n\nThere's a mountain of physics problems. In the interest of time, here's two, with the second more important:\n\n* Near the beginning of the movie, George Clooney jets over to Sandra Bullock and gives her a strap and tows her back. If you've ever towed a car with a strap, you'd very much recognize what happens next -- she bounces a bit as she starts moving and then remains a fixed distance from George with tension in the line. Only, there is something that cars have that Sandra didn't, friction. There is nothing to pull her back and resist the tension, so she would not bounce and stabilize, only bounce once and then collide with George.\n\n* Let's look at the big cliche moment of the film, when they're flying with parachute straps and eventually get caught and stop. Let's ignore everything that brought them to this point, and just look at when they're stationary. Sandra is caught on the station with parachute straps, and George is hanging from her with a strap. I use the word hanging because that is what he was doing in the movie, only it makes no goddamned sense. There is something pulling George away from Sandra, but it's nothing that actually exists. George ends up cutting himself free and falling, in the most cliche mountain-climbing scenario ever, except that they aren't on a mountain and there's nothing to make him fall. There are simply no external forces at play. Orbit *is* free-fall; they're all already falling. George can't be fallinger. It's not even a word. And, physics aside, it's lazy story-telling.\n\nWhen I finished watching this movie, I was sure that someone pitched a shitty mountain climbing movie, and some Hollywood exec exlaimed, \"Just put this thing in space, and you've got a hit!\"\n\nI'm okay with watching Sci-Fi with made up technologies that aren't really explained and may or may not ever be possible. But that's not what Gravity was; it presented itself as a realistic scenario, and it was far from that.\n\nI demand two things from movies: Self-consistency and a decent story. I really don't think it's too much to ask, and Gravity was severely lacking on both counts.\n\nSure, Gravity was pretty. It could have just been called Avatar 2.",

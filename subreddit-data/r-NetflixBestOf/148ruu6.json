    "postText": "After the difficulty of not only finding something to watch, but also finding something I could watch with the wife, we had stumbled upon \"The Plagues of Breslau\". It was a polish movie that I had never heard of so we gave it a shot after briefly reading what it was about. This movie was fantastic, I'd say it was a mix of \"Law Abiding Citizen\" and \"Se7en\". I liked that it had been dubbed in English so I didn't have ti read subtitles the entire time. I'm looking for another movie that has some gore and wild twists and turns to check out next!",

I was so pleasantly surprised with this movie and am always on the lookout for more hidden gems",

I have nothing against rip offs, as a lot of things we consider originals are actually rip offs of other products.  And I'll admit, I was sorely disappointed.  Outside of a broad concept of children killing each other, they're nothing alike.  And I just didn't care at all for The Hunger Games.",

The fact that it is a game that is put on by a authoritarian government is the biggest similarity.  Also the use of danger zones and safe zones and inclusion of previous winners.\n\nSo it's not just about children killing each other.  Battle Royale and Hunger Games are much more similar to each other than say Lord of the Flies.",

They have to fight each other for three days until the last one remains, and they are forced to wear a special collar that will explode when they break a rule.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n&gt; The film was highly acclaimed by critics in the Western world, with an 87% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 45 reviews with an average rating of 7\\.5\\/10\\. The site's consensus reads, \"Battle Royale is a controversial and violent parable of adolescence, heightening teenage melodrama with life-or-death stakes.\" Robert Koehler of Variety commented, \"Given the most basic characters to work with, the mostly teen cast attacks the material with frightening gusto, and Fujiwara dutifully invokes the voice of inner moral conflict. Production is exceedingly handsome and vigorous, offering no sign that Fukasaku is slowing down.\" He stated that, \"returning to his roots as Japan's maestro of mayhem, Kinji Fukasaku has delivered\" one of \"his most outrageous and timely films\", comparing it to \"the outrage over youth violence\" that Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange \"generated in early-'70s Britain\" and featuring some of \"the most startling scenes of mayhem since the movies of the wild and bloody '70s.\" Jason Korsner of BBC News gave Battle Royale four out of five stars, stating that it is \"a heart-stopping action film, teaching us the worthy lessons of discipline, teamwork, and determination, but wrapping them up in a deliberately provocative, shockingly violent package.\" BBC users gave the film five out of five stars. Almar Haflidason of BBC also gave the film five out of five stars. In a review for Empire, critic Kim Newman gave the film four stars out of five. He compared it to Lord of the Flies in how it makes audiences \"wonder what they would do in the same situation\", but wrote that Battle Royale gives \"even harder choices for its school-uniformed characters.\" He concluded that, \"Some will be uncomfortable or appalled, and the mix of humour and horror is uneasy, but this isn't a film you'll forget easily. And, seriously, what would you do?\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Batoru+rowaiaru+%282000%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle%20Royale%20%28film%29), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/battle_royale/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/battle-royale-2000), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70004548), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q864592).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F7ftudt \"Confidence: 1.02\").

Like, come on, just enjoy the movie for what it is if it was a decent adaptation of the themes/concepts of the book.... \n\nBut in this case, it's absurdly true. I can't think of any other movie that is as drastic as this. IMHO, while the movie may be interesting/entertaining on its own, the movie completely lost so much of what made the book great. The book actually has character background and development that adds a lot for explaining how students react to the situation. All the characters are so much more compelling. Shinji and Hiroki are my favorites and have no role in the movie. Kazuo and Mitsuko are so much more intimidating. It also completely skips over many of the themes/concepts explored in the book.\n\nTramps like us..",

But unless someone comes forward and claims he actually did that, there is nothing but a sad, pathetic rape fantasy there. And his rape fantasy is not the same as an actual rape. Men and women play out and have rape fantasies. There is an entire genre of porn about rape fantasies. Having one and being a rapist are not the same. It's very different.  To call him a rapist for a story he told in the context of attempting to entertain his podcast listeners is just silly. Unless there is more than just the disgusting story he told?",

When the men come back, she must navigate the transition of power to her nephew while also trying to keep the family unit together. It's a complex dramatic show. \n\nAnd there's also lots of razor blades \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Please look past the name. \n\nYou\u2019re The Worst - it\u2019s about an on again/off again straight couple and they both make plenty of horrible decisions. The title of the show is describing both halves of the couple. \n\nEuphoria - Zendaya is the main character and she plays an addict who is in high school. I\u2019d say she\u2019s overall a good person but sometimes does morally ambiguous/bad things in order to get high.\n\nFaking It - 2 best friends pretend to be in a lesbian relationship in order to become popular kids. But then one of them actually falls for the other. It\u2019s definitely an MTV show marketed to teenagers but it\u2019s pretty campy and gay and I liked it.\n\nBroad City - About 2 best friends living in NYC. Alana is very unhinged and morally ambiguous. Stoner comedy vibes though, I wouldn\u2019t call it dramatic at all.\n\nEdit: I saw somebody else mention Good Girls and that show is exactly like what you\u2019re describing. Fleabag fits well too and is hilarious",

I actually started at season 2 bc I find a lot o US shows to start slowly. But, the writing and acting on Killjoys was beyond any level of series  I've seen before. And that's including a ton of BBC shows I love. It's on the level of a Shakespearean drama. Like a great book, it takes a little while for the good stuff to start.",

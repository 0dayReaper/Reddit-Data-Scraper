I take that back, Inglorious Bastards is my favorite Tarantino movie but this one comes in at a close second. Walter Goggins (Chris Mannix aka The Sheriff of Redrock) steals the entire movie. He is incredible. Oscar worthy. His performance still blows me away after 10+ viewings. Same with Jennifer Jason Leigh. I love the scene where she plays Jim Jones at Botany Bay on the guitar.\n\n\n",

            "comment": "Oh man this movie was great, but I had a really embarrassing story in the movie theatre. My girlfriend, now wife, is Brazilian and speaks English well but doesn't know all the words or history. She is from a small town in the south of Brazil. Long story short, I had to use the restroom, and when I had come back it happened to be Intermission (which I wasn't expecting) so there was like a 10-minute break between the two halves of the movie. \n\nI ask my wife \"what did I miss?\" and she goes on to describe Samuel L. Jackson's character as \"The Nxxxxr\" in a very thick accent, more like \"de nee-xxx\" and we are literally right next to a very nice black couple in their mid 30s. \n\nThe conversation went like this:\n\n\"So what did I miss?\"\n\n\n\"Well, de Nee-xxx was talking with the---\" (very loudly)\n\n\n\"WHAT STOP\" *starts to panic*\n\n\n\"Stop what? What are you saying, 'nee-xxx?' thats his name?\" *confused but stubborn*\n\n\n\"(WIFE'S NAME) STOP SAYING THAT!\" (trying to whisper loudly and really losing my shit) \n\n\n\"UGH NEExxx NEExxx NEExxx stop telling me to shut up\" \n\n\n\nAt that point I had to grab her and get really serious and tell her to stop yelling that. She literally had no idea what the word meant or the historical context at all. Where she's from they don't give a shit about race and don't have the same issues or anything like that. \n\nPretty brutal to be a part of in the moment, but funny now. I am sure the couple heard us but I looked over and they didn't react. She is embarrassed about it now but denies repeating the word when I said stop \"I didnt say nee-xxx nee-xxx nee-xxx!!\" \n\nI mean, they do say the word 100 times in the first 5 minutes, still not sure how Tarantino manages to say things like \"does this look like dead n-xxxxx storage?\" and use it constantly in all of his movies, but he is the one white person with a pass in hollywood. \n\n(more bleeps than a CIA release)",

    "postText": "I propose we set a date to stage a protest to get rid of the annoying automatic video previews. The protest - cancel Netflix (for at least one day). If enough people cancel at once maybe that will get their attention. I suggest 12/12/19 as \u201cCancel Netflix Day\u201d. It\u2019s not a weekend, it\u2019s well before the usual Christmas break, it\u2019s easy to remember. What say you?\n\nUPDATE:  We did it!  It\u2019s official.  Netflix will now let you turn off those dreaded auto play previews.   https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/06/how-to-turn-off-netflix-autoplay-previews.html",

People would even review shows that were out of order and include the proper order to watch shows.  \n\nNetflix taking away the social components- star ratings and reviews- was the worst mistake.\n\nI only hang on because my wife watches several Netflix shows.  When Friends leaves next year we will probably discontinue our service.  It's just too easy for me to sign up for Netflix a month at a time to binge watch something new.  Like I said, since there is no social component there is no reason to keep the service month to month.",

It's horrible, it tries it's best to hide 4k content, you search for a show it doesn't highlight the 4k version. \n\nThe FF or rewind feature is just so badly implemented you have to wonder what was the thought process behind it. \n\nEpisodes and seasons are laid out really illogiclly. \n\nAnd those saying the auto preview driving then away from Netflix are ok with an ad playing before a show on Amazon are fine with that?",

Elsewhere in this thread I even explicitly said that it was pointless and misguided:\n\n&gt; Cancelling Netflix for a day wouldn\u2019t do anything to them because subscriptions are payed for the entire month. They don\u2019t give you a partial refund if you cancel before your month is over, they just let you keep access for the rest of your month. The only way this protest would ever even catch the attention of Netflix execs is if people cancelled their subscription and left it cancelled past their renewal date. If people just cancel and then resubscribe again in time for them to be billed on their original billing date, then it\u2019s not affecting Netflix. They still got their money for your original monthly payment, and they\u2019ll still be billing you on the same date that they would have regardless. All you will have done is waste your time clicking \u201ccancel\u201d and then entering your login and payment info to reactivate your billing a day later. So basically they lose no money and you wasted a couple minutes of your day while gaining nothing in terms of supporting your cause.",

Seems that every viewer worldwide understands this and thinks this way yet so many content holders refuse to operate with this bit of common sense. So freaking annoying! There are many sites I refuse to visit anymore because of their self-starting videos with some having more than one playing at one time, which makes no sense. Sometimes browser add-ons designed to stop these work while others don't. Haven't seen one yet designed specifically to stop Netflix previews but would be nice. But that would only work on web based viewing. Heck, I'd be happy if Netflix designed a control for our preferences to allow us to play/stop previews.",

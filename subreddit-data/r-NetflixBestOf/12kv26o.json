    "postText": "(DISCUSSION) MINDHUNTER S3/4\n\nJust a thought. I know season 3 has not been renewed and I remember reading something about production costs\u2026 but it would be sic if they got Evans Peters (Dahmer) and Zac Efron (Bundy)\u2026 possibly even the guy they got in Dahmer to play Gacy for a season 3/4 - would tie those series\u2019s they did into Mindhunter, IMO the best series Netflix has done.\nJust saying",

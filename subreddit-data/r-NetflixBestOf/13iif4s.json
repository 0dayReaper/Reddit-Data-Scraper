I'm going right into the next one (Mexico I think) after I finish the 3rd season.  I just finished Better Call Saul prior because I wanted more drug crime related drama.",

(Ignore the fact the characters are based on a computer game if you're not in to that stuff; many people have watched this with no knowledge of the game and found it superb)  \n\n\n[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/arcane\\_league\\_of\\_legends/s01](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/arcane_league_of_legends/s01)",

There is diversity and all but it makes sense in that universe and the characters are what matters and they are all complex and well done, as well as the script.\n\nAfter watching Arcane I watched the CyberPunk series that was so acclaimed everywhere and I felt like CyberPunk was a very bad anime with nearly static animation most of the time and a story that makes no sense. One is art the other is shit.",

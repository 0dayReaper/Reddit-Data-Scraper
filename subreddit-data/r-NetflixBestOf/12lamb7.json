    "postText": "For years I\u2019ve been looking for documentaries (for lack of a better word) on Netflix about what life was like during different parts of history. The Great Depression, Industrial Revolution, ancient civilizations, global pandemics, even just random slices of life in seemingly unimportant time periods. A story about a random family living in a random place hundreds of years ago. Idk, whatever. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve found mostly are shows about the standard ancient civilizations like Egypt and the Mayan empire, etc and I\u2019ve watched all of those and enjoyed them. Or shows about wars, but mostly from a military or government perspective\u2014 I want something about regular people. \n\nDoes anyone have ideas??? \n\nSome suggestions I\u2019ve probably seen but can\u2019t think of right now to reference. But I feel like a dinosaur because I find it hard to search for specific topics on Netflix. \n\nTIA :)",

                    "comment": "Thank you! Great list. :) \nMost of these I have seen and enjoyed (especially the dust bowl one! Really great) But kind of fall into what I was saying about most historical shows being focused on a political or military perspective or event. Major events are super interesting and I still eat them up lol but I\u2019m looking for shows that really explore what regular life was like for everyday people. \n\nI\u2019ve not seen The War or WWII in Color yet, and although it\u2019s a military focus, the perspective of regular soldiers &amp; civilians is exactly what I\u2019m after. I\u2019m putting those on my short list, thanks so much! The Roosevelts also sounds up my alley so I\u2019m excited for that. \n\nI\u2019ve loved The Crown but am looking for something unscripted/not using actors (except maybe in re-enactments). \n\nI do appreciate learning the history of design and food, etc but it\u2019s not really what I\u2019m looking for in this case. \n\nI wish I could find more things like the dust bowl! I watched something on Hulu a while back about families who traveled the Oregon trail in covered wagons and that was the best I\u2019ve seen in a long while. \n\nThanks for the suggestions! Definitely helpful :)",

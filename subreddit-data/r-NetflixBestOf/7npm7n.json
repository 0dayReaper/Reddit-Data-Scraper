But really the film has just become the newest method for schizophrenics to have their paranoia manifested (although now the movie is so old that it's probably not as common these days).\n\nIn the 70s/80s it was KGB spying on them. It's interesting how these paranoid delusions change depending on the relevant social stimuli happening at the time.",

Such complete manipulation of his life, yet the draw of the show itself was supposed to be the concept of watching a person without their knowledge, therefore allowing them (in theory) to be completely candid and themselves.  Yet Truman was never truly given that chance, because they pulled all the strings.  Such an amazing story and film, absolutely one of my all time favorites!",

We know something he doesn't know, and we're on edge waiting to see how he might discover it or be prevented from doing so.\n\nJust as a for-instance, in a movie where the information is kept from the audience, the scene where [Truman attempts to cross the bridge but is kept out due to implausible emergencies like a nuclear reactor incident](/spoiler) would have little meaning until a second viewing. It would certainly be unusual and would probably confuse the audience, as there would seemingly be no reason these things are happening. In a movie where the audience knows the twist, we're still empathizing with Truman's confusion, but we're also rooting for him and being frustrated at his attempts being thwarted. We know *why* these things are happening and are helpless to stop him, much like the folks outside the show.\n\nIt's down to preference, but I think a movie that is largely the same beyond saving the twist for later in the plot would simply transfer the intended audience engagement to second viewings and would result in a weirdly empty and confusing movie up until the twist.",

The comedy comes from the dramatic irony, being \"in on it\" while Truman isn't  (at first). Also wouldn't be able to establish Christoph's character much at all, and the satirical elements would be lost. Having it be a twist at the end would make it a Black Mirror episode, not a Jim Carrey comedy",

The critically acclaimed feature film The Truman Show, written by Andrew Niccol, was inspired by this episode, and won the 1999 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, beating the Babylon 5 finale \"Sleeping In Light\", also written by Straczynski.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

This is like the fifth trueman show thread where I\u2019ve mentioned dark city and the only time I got a response and not pincushioned with down votes. Obviously they have a myriad of differences (dark city is way better imho) but the plot outline (hero escapes from an artificial reality), the parallel scenes and especially the symbolism (compare the use of the beach in both films) is strikingly similar to me. They were both released in the same year by Australian directors and I wonder about the quality and quantity of drugs they took together which  made them think \u201clet\u2019s both make trippy movies about Gnosticism.\u201d Someone with more free time and motivation should make a side by side comparison of these films and post it on YouTube so that I can have a visual reference to refer to when I talk about this at parties and people start to back away slowly.

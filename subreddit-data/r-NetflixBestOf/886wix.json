We were told about this experimental film and there's really no plot or characters, it's just a beautiful music score and \"life\". I think it was the class favorite. This documentary is a 3 part series called Qatsi so check out the other if you like it. \n\nThat one brought to mind my other favorite which is very similar, Baraka, the first film done at 8K resolution. It's mostly just showing culture across the world, it's beautiful and eye-opening.\n\nBaraka - 1992 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSfFHxyYJJA\n\nAlso, it had a recent follow up, Samsara (2011).\n\nI'll try to think of my other favorites that aren't so similar haha. Enjoy!\n\n",

American sushi for the most part, is about turning tables.  The chefs only talk to you to get your order, load rolls with rice and fake crab and mayo so you fill up fast and GTFO.",

As someone who's been in the industry for a decade, just as a cook not a chef, your life starts to revolve around the people you work with. They become your closest friends and who you hang out with outside of work. It's also the reason I'm looking for a way out. I'd like to have a career that offers benefits, sick days and paid vacations.\n\nThere's definitely a tough guy stigma surrounding kitchen work. You're frowned upon if you take time off due to illness or just needing personal time. I admire the people who can handle it, but I've also seen too many overworked cooks break down and self destruct from working too much. ",

They don\u2019t intimidate customers, good service and they advise kindly.\n\nThat\u2019s said, given the opportunity I\u2019d love to try Jiro. No doubt it\u2019s great food but after watching the documentary and reading reviews and blog posts, it just sounds a little hype-y.\n\nEdit: sorry for shitting on your pal Jiro while you\u2019re all busy jerking off over his over hyped bullshit.",

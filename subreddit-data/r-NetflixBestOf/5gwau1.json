I was alone and a little high when I watched it and I honestly don't think I'll ever be able to watch that episode again.\n\nAlthough, a small part of me wants to rewatch it just in case it's not really as bad as it was at the time. But what if it is as bad? What if it's worse?",

They had a quick narrative with all the character development done well through the flow of the story. \n\nSan Junipero could have been even better with 20-30 minutes added on back story and the courtship. It was also the best cinematography by far. ",

I feel like, because every episode is a standalone too, you can't really bond with any of the characters. The show feels so clinical, trying to get their techno-pessimist message across over and over. To the point where I feel like if you want to be a technology-boogeyman so clinically, go make a documentary. Honestly pretty disappointed that I had to go so far down this thread to see a somewhat critical comment abut this show. Just my 2 cents :) ",

It looks like some of the replies I'm getting are finding camaraderie with me, but the message does not hold a candle to the social commentary of, say, Twilight Zone which talked about bigotry, xenophobia, fear of the unknown, fear of the known, racism...even when some of those things were unfortunately in vogue for our country. Black Mirror comes across as \"Technology is making us all stupid and crazy and it will eventually kill us all\", when I see a greater benefit in it than I do a hindrance. It's almost nagging. ",

The show isn't trying to say 'technology is bad, fear the techno-boogeyman\"; technology is not inherently good or bad in any of the episodes.\n\nTechnology can, however, bring out some of the more unpleasant aspects of human behavior i.e. the constant approval-seeking and superficiality in 'Nosedive', or obsessiveness and jealousy in 'The Entire History of You', or vigilante justice in 'Shut up and Dance'. To me, the show isn't about technology, its an exploration of how people might respond when given the means to act upon the less savory aspects of our nature.",

Every episode has overly hamfisted themes, which would be fine if there was an actual story arc within each episode populated by likable (or at least relatable) characters, but there isn't really. It's just a protagonist that experiences and/or performs creepier and creepier things until the episode just ends suddenly (sometimes with a predictable cliche \"twist\"). I don't really relate to anything that's going on.\n\nThe premises are intriguing, but I felt like each episode was the first half of a (mediocre) movie.",

It's like yes, he was weird, but there are people in real life who are just like that and he portrayed it perfectly. This isn't some USA network show where all actors are attractive and \"normal\". I thought playtest was one of the stronger episodes because it tapped into pretty much my biggest fear. Super dark and exciting.",

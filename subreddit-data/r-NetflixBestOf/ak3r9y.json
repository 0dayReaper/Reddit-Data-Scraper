Just one of the wonderful details you find.\n\nAnd its mind blowing too to think that even though the director made his life really hard with all those long no-cut scenes, he ALSO added the extra difficulty of having to shoot with animals. (I know a couple are CGI but still!)",

But like BR, it later gathered a following among those who liked the stunning rich visual narrative/imagery, and feel that the movie is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nThis is as valid a reason to love this movie as any, so I'm not stopping anyone. On an art house level, these films are beyond reproach. But I think there's a dichotomy here of people who actually love the movie, and people who think it looks pretty and feel like they're supposed to love it because it's a cult classic (coughbladerunner) \n\nYour username is a quote from the Godfather so you're obviously not opposed to rich cinematography and slow plodding pacing, so it's clear you don't hate this movie on a superficial level. Children of Men very much reminds me of \"the Pianist\" - it looks, feels and flows very similarly. But I find that an infinitely superior movie. \n\nI don't like Clive Owen, so that doesn't help. He has all the charisma of a loaf of bread.",

Some movies have a certain look and feel that mystify the audiences, even though they're not necessarily efficient as works of art. They create universes so awesome that people forget about the actual film. In the case of Blade Runner: awesome universe, sub-par screenplay. The sequel is actually better than the first, but no one will admit to that. There is such thing as \"reverse ageism\" for works of art. I'm running the risk of being downvoted to oblivion here, but the same is partially true for Star Wars. Children of Men do have an amusing universe (notice that I'm not saying \"awesome\"), but it fails in its storytelling devices. It's a melodrama that uses messianic themes in a way that I found extremely cheap and cheesy. This is not my first language and I can't perfectly translate my thinking, but to me Children of Men feels like a bad love song from the 90s: it tries so hard to appeal to my emotions that the result is pure nausea.\n\nI like Clive Owen, though. He was great in Inside Man.\n",

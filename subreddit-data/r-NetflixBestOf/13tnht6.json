I\u2019ve desperately been trying to find a similar show that\u2019ll be just as good but idk I can\u2019t find one that piques my interest. I have a flight tomorrow and I\u2019m thinking about just rewatching BEEF already cuz jeez it was just so good. Do y\u2019all think it\u2019d be bad/weird to rewatch a show so soon?",

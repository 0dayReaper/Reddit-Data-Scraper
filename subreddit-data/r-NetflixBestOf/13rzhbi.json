This was 2 nights before anyone could see it. The movies my friends would get from the theater would always be on VHS in a plain black case, no matter the movie. \n\nAnyways, we watched it and everyone thought it was a true story. It wasn't until later that year on the MTV Movie Awards that the cast of the movie came onstage to present an award and then people all knew it was a hoax and wasn't real. You're correct though, that motherfucker would have Charles Manson looking under his bed every night because of how scary it was.",

It's kinda hard to see everything on screen due to the film being mostly made at night and made cheap in the 1970's)\n\nAnyway, it's a true story that happened in the 1940's in Texarkana, Arkansas. A man wears a white hood over his face and head (like the male killer in The Strangers) and he begins murdering people in town and always at night. He kills couples that go parking on backroads to make out. He also breaks in on females and kills them. He finds a couple after a local high school football game and one of them were in the school band and had their trombone in the car. He ties one of them to a huge tree while alive. He puts a butcher knife on the trombone somehow and he stands in front of the person tied to the tree and starts blowing on the trombone and playing it with his right arm. (You play trombone by moving it forward and backwards with your arm and you just blow it like any horn or saxaphone). So as he is moving it back and forth, the butcher knife hooked to it is stabbing the person. That was wild. \n\nAnyway, it ends with police in a foot chase with the killer at night. He crosses some train tracks before a train comes. By the time police got there, the train was running through so the killer got away and was never caught. He was a serial killer and rapist. The locals would board up their windows before sundown every evening so he wouldn't break in. \n\nYou can read all about it on Wikipedia and almost everybody believes it was one of their local policemen killing everyone. Whomever the killer was, they're long dead by now. \n\nSorry for the long post",

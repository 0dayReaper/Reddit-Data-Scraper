Not necessarily the very first couple seasons when the show had a somewhat different format. But after that, for a long time before the show left the BBC for Channel 4. There were different presenters/hosts and one of the judges was different. The show is still great, but it has evolved somewhat. The original presenters were perfectly chosen and the change of judges isn't bad but a bit disappointing bc Mary Berry was so beloved.",

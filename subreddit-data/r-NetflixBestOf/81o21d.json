And Peter is so upset when he finds out about the cheating, but then he doesn\u2019t reject her advances *until his dick is already in her mouth* when he\u2019s supposedly really serious about how things are going with Rachel? Super hypocritical of him. Rachel had every right to cut him off completely after that.\n\nIt\u2019s a hilarious movie, but I would have liked it even more if Rachel actually broke things off with Peter permanently, and if that drove him to improve himself without him winning her back in some way at the end.

He seemed totally cool and normal and we left him alone. It didn't seem like anyone else noticed him, although it looked like the staff knew him and he'd been there before.",

And also because the episodes frequently end on a cliffhanger. I believe the creator of Lost also had some creative input as well. \n\nI never actually saw Pushing Daisies",

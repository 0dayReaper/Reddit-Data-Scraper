They would have punked out, worried about testing, changed it, and ended up with a much less satisfying movie.\n\nA good counterexample is the movie \"Passengers\". I read an early version of that script and it was incredible. Totally made sense why the studio bought it and why Pratt and JLaw signed on. Problem is, when they did, suddenly the movie had to cost $100 million+, and it had to do $300 million+ to break even. That's pressure.\n\nTherefore: at some point, the studio got nervous about some of the darker moments and themes, and started changing the script to make it more conventional, especially the ending.\n\nThat's how, despite a nearly perfect sci fi premise executed in a tight and surprising script, what we ended up with was a broad, cliched romantic drama set in space. By the way, it's not clear the studio was wrong to do that. The movie did make lots of money internationally: Broad romances with super famous, hot people do well. But for people with sophisticated palettes, it ruined the movie.\n\nEx Machina avoided that fate by limiting its palette and by using relatively unknown actors (though they are stars NOW). It kept its script intact and they made a classic.",

But that's the dramatic question: Can you stay mad at someone forever when they're the only person you'll ever see again, even if they richly deserve it?\n\nI saw the same video you mention, and I agree with its maker that the reordering would have been helpful in terms of creating some sympathy for Pratt before the reveal of his undeniable creepiness. However, the creepiness is (for me) essential to what's so interesting about the concept, which is why the ending is such a cop out.\n\nInstead of dealing with the actual effects of the creepiness and finding a dramatic way to resolve them, the film reverses the creepiness with over-the-top self-sacrifice. It un-asks the movie's central question by reassuring us that, really, Pratt is a hero and whatever caused him to steal Jlaw's life by waking her up was just a momentary aberration and not central to his character.\n\nWhat would have been so much more interesting is a movie where \"this guy is a creep and he stole your life from you because he was lonely\" was the unadulterated reality, and the question stayed: \"Can you find a way to connect with this person on a human level in spite of that\" rather than \"How is Chris Pratt going to show us that he was really a hero all along\"\n\nBesides: Ex Machina was super creepy. The quirky, creepy weirdness of it was a huge part of what made it so great.",

It's supposedly the most significant event in the history of mankind, but only a small group of people seem to be tasked with uncovering the mystery, with a psychologist as head honcho.\n\nIn addition to this, they lost a few days in the beginning of their journey due to \"memory loss\", but later in the film they don't seem to have any problems remembering previous events.\nA lot of these inconsistencies could have been explained, or alluded to one, but they were not.",

In the book the psychologist was actually the head of the research organization, and had ties to the original Area X site, iirc this was vaguely alluded to in the movie, but i'm not sure.  I think memory loss is simply the character's way of justifying to themselves the unexplainable loss of time they experience.\n\n As for why they sent in scientists after a military squad failed, that's a good question for the movie.",

We don't even get a reasoning for her decision to go on a pointless solo mission, when they had a bigger task at hand.",

If you have Netflix outside the U.S. you should have it available. \n\nA24 films vary a lot in content, but the quality of everything I've seen has been superb.\n\nSome personal favorites in no particular order would be:\n\nThe Killing of a Sacred Deer\n\nAnnihilation\n\nLady Bird\n\nIt Comes at Night\n\nEdit: forgot this was a Netflix sub. It's not A24 but 'It Follows' is on Netflix in the U.S. and that's by far one of my favorite horror/thriller films in recent history. If you somehow haven't heard of it, I would avoid trailers or any plot synopsis of the film",

At what point is something sentient, when does it deserve compassion and rights? How do you iterate to improve it? Is it ever ethical to shut it down if it doesn't have a naturally finite lifespan? \nIt also focuses on gender-based power dynamics. Imagine Ava was a human woman in the same situation. Actually, rewatch the movie pretending that it's true, it really changes the implications of everyone's behavior throughout the film. Both of the men were basically her captors, and wanted to control her. She had to escape both of them, through any means necessary (including feigning love). Even the guy who helped her escape would have effectively been her captor out in the real world, because he could expose her identity at any time (which would probably result in her capture, or worse).\nIn the end, she finally has freedom the minute she gets out of the helicopter. No one will be able to find her after that. I would even consider her actions to be morally justified. ] (/spoiler)",

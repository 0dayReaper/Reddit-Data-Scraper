            "comment": "The Summer I Turned Pretty on Amazon. I thought I would hate this show but it was actually good. It\u2019s a romance\n\nHeartstopper on Netflix:  Another romance. It\u2019s really good. Definitely one of the best things that Netflix has put out in recent years \n\nThe Sandman on Netflix:  It\u2019s like a supernatural thriller. Very good. Another one of Netflix\u2019s best shows in my opinion \n\nLockwood and Co on Netflix: much like The Sandman it is like a supernatural thriller. There is some slow burn romance between the leads and again much like The Sandman and Heartstopper I think it\u2019s one of best shows that Netflix has put out in recent years \n\nCruel Summer on Hulu: It\u2019s a thriller/mystery. It takes place over the course of 3 summers each being a year apart. I thought it was really good",

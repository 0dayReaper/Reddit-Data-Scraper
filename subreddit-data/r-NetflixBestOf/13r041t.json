Some with mini descriptions. \n\nBroadchurch (Masterpiece of a murder mystery)\n\n\nHow To Get Away With Murder (Most insane twists every 3 episodes with the most incredible and perfect finale ever)\n\n\nDesperate Housewives (pure gold entertainment. Please please please for the love of god watch this. It\u2019s not the reality show btw!)\n\n\nPose (Trans representation and you\u2019ll cry, laugh, and scream every episode haha it\u2019s amazing)\n\n\nThe Good Place (perfect mix of comedy, Philosophy, and life lessons)\n\n\nFleabag (most brilliant comedy to exist)\n\n\nBig Little Lies (10/10 no other words)\n\n\nThe Morning Show (Another 10/10. Don\u2019t believe me? Watch the first episode)\n\n\nMare of Easttown (Murder mystery almost as good as broadchurch)\n\n\nShameless &amp; Sex education (if you for some reason haven\u2019t yet)\n\nI\u2019ll conclude by saying I think Desperate Housewives and How to get away with murder 100% fit what you\u2019re looking for while the others I think you\u2019d very much enjoy.",

However I\u2019d definitely now rank Broadchurch, Mare of Easttown, and Big Little lies as the most likely you\u2019ll enjoy haha however Fleabag, Shameless and Sex Ed are amazing comedies with some drama and The morning show is a fkn ride man. The story is loosely based off the Matt Lauer scandal but with Jennifer Anniston, Reece Witherspoon, and Steve Carrell. Also I just feel like every person on earth should watch Pose. I really learned a lot from that show.",

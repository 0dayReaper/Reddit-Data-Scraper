Really well made, great cinematography with emphasis on the changing of seasons. As a bonus there is an underlying food theme that works well with the plot.",

In terms of other wlw movies with similar cinematography I\u2019d say Summerland, Tell it To The Bees, Cracks, Desert Hearts, Madchen in Uniform (the 50s one), Colette, and Carol if you haven\u2019t seen it already. My favorite wlw movie of all time with impeccable cinematography is Aimee and Jaguar",

Ie, if you punch the clock day in and day out and nothing new ever happens, you don't have much for your memory to latch onto.\n\nThat period of time will seem like it went by quickly when you look back on it.\n\nBackpack across Asia on foot meeting new people and seeing new places daily for a year, and that year will seem to have been a long journey when you reflect on it.\n\nSo the secret to living a \"long life\" is having novel experiences constantly. Good luck with that :)",

[This](http://www.squabblebox.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/12monkeys1995-1.jpg) is more like what I expected.\n\nIn fact, now I need to watch it again.  But not on US Netflix, not on Amazon Prime.\n\nI was in a test audience for this one.  I didn't half-heart the questionnaire at the end and made it clear that they must not change the plot.  Of course I would have had zero to a trivial effect on their decision, but I was very glad to see that they kept things as I'd seen them originally.\n",

The movie was so gory and no one recognized the actors, the director was arrested for murder shortly after the release of the film. He had to prove in court that it wasn't a snuff film, that the actors were alive, and demonstrate the special effects.",

It stars Carl Gabriel Yorke, Robert Kerman, Francesca Ciardi, Perry Pirkanen, and Luca Barbareschi. Influenced by the works of Mondo director Gualtiero Jacopetti, the film was inspired by Italian media reporting of Red Brigade terrorism. The coverage included news reports Deodato believed to be staged, an idea which became an integral aspect of the film's story.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

It also confuses me that people would see a thread about a movie they haven't seen and assume there aren't any spoilers. If I haven't seen a movie I try to avoid discussions about it until I do if I'm worried about spoilers. ",

That is the one thing you typically need for a protagonist to be a protagonist.  You don't need to like them, you don't need to admire them, but you do need to sympathize with them, you need to see the action of the story from their point of view.\n\nOr you can have an \"Anti-hero\", which is character you don't sympathize with as much, but do end up \"rooting for\" anyway. The Punisher would be a good example. But an anti-hero still needs some redeemable quality somewhere.\n\nThis movie just utterly failed to give me any reason to root for anyone. When a movie is just a bunch of assholes killing each other and I don't care who wins then I have no emotional investment in the outcome.  I am completely disengaged from the story.  I am just watching violence porn at that point.  If I want violence porn I'll go to liveleak.\n\nTL;DR: A movie needs to give you someone to root for. Inglorious Basterds gave me no one to root for. So I quit watching.",

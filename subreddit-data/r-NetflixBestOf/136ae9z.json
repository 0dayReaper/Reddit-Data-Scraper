Something light and interesting I like to watch a lot is The Good Place, but I\u2019m pretty passionately interested in philosophy. Mike Schurr(sp?) managed to take a pretty dry and inaccessible subject and make it incredibly smart, funny, thought provoking, and with a perfect ending. Loved it. Not sure what your in the mood for so tried to give a few different genres :)",

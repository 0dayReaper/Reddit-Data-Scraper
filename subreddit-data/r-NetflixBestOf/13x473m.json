    "postText": "Major spoilers alert!\n\nRewatching Sick Note on Netflix years after its released and I realize I'm not actually sure who killed Daniels best friend, Ash. So obviously he fell by accident, was run over by the doctor and later seemed to be making a recovery until his feeding tube was switched with his IV. \n\nInitially Daniel accuses Nick Frost (Dr. Glennis), then the nurse \"confesses\" but later we see her being interviewed by the police officer where she makes a very convincing argument that her statement was misconstrued and she isnt responsible.\n\nSo it occurred to me at the funeral that I really don't know who is responsible for his feeding tube related demise. Can anyone answer this??",

It was a great plot element bc I originally just thought he was a supporting character for Daniel to bounce his ideas off for the audience to hear. But oh my did it get deeper. His interactions with Becca was the best. In fact Becca was one of my favorite people in the show bc she started out a voice of reason and got more deranged with each passing minute. I know Im going on And on and I apologize but I've had no one to discuss the show with as it's just me and four kids at home lol!!",

Full lump in the throat. I was really looking forward to it too, having loved that story in the comic. Even my wife who never read the comic was in tears. \n\nOther parts... uh... The actress who played Rose Walker was honestly, horrendous. Some of her line deliveries were straight-up high-school play level. It's really hard to overlook such bad acting when you're casting her in the same show as David Thewlis, Stephen Fry, Sanjeev Baskar, Charles Dance, and Joely Richardson. It's inconceivable that they don't get her into an acting class before the next season.\n\nThe guy they chose for the Corinthian was fantastic. The Cereal Convention episode came out feeling very similar to the comic. David Thewlis was amazing as Dr. Destiny, his scenes with Joely Richardson were amazing and the Diner episode was better than the comic in my opinion. His scenes with the lady in the car were edge-of-your seat tense. Amazing.\n\nI love Patton Oswalt, but he didn't work for me the way it was done. His line delivery just felt like a guy reading lines in a microphone. Like Patton Oswalt, I love Gwendoline Christie, but I just personally wasn't in love with her in this particular role, as a fan of the comic. There's a few other actresses I could see being a better fit.\n\nSo... It was a mixed bag for us. Great some areas, okay in others, and bad in a few small parts.\n\nIf you like the comic it's definitely something that you might like. At least check out the Death episode if nothing else.",

They've made some very deliberate choices for this production that feel like they came from a boardroom full of suits. There's a lot of moments in the show that feel more CW than HBO. I really wish they'd gone ahead with Bryan Fuller. Fuller's *American Gods* season 1 has an artistic quality that I think would've worked really well with this show. If you watch that season and *Hannibal* you start to pickup on a trend... really good productions capitalize on small moments. They make very simple scenes artistic and imaginative. There's moments in *Sandman* where a more creative production team could've had a field day with, but the current team just used those moments to get from A to B.",

My favorite devil in all of cinema. Can't believe that it hasn't been rebooted. The story format potential it had was right up there with Travelers and Beforeigners. Like, the kind of show that easily could have had 10 seasons.\n\n[A review of the show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQtdG6e7m3I) (some spoilers)   \nBut I really recommend just watching it.\n\nAlso, weirdly, there's an actor in the show that plays basically the same character in Brimstone as he does in Firefly. Also, the show was a victim of the same FOX studios inter-office politics that killed Firefly. The show was purposefully sabotage by studio exec Doug Herzog. Same guy who sabotaged Millenium.",

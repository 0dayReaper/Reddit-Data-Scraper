I found the characters and setting very bland and unoriginal and the central plot seemed (from what was shown in the first few episodes) very Damon Lindelof/Lost style, \"give them a strange mystery to hook them\" without appearing to have any other substance to it in terms of world building or storytelling. Both of the latter also seemed to contain significant holes that undercut any believability. After looking at the books to see if they might have been better I'm at a loss to explain their popularity.",

There are one or two gender swaps different from the book and episode 2 reveals a part in the book that wasn\u2019t revealed until around chapter 40 but isn\u2019t very crucial to the story so it\u2019s not a huge spoiler. The show has added new plots that are very different in execution from the book but end up with the same outcomes so im ok with that as sometimes you have to take a part from a book which might have a great internal dialogue which works on the page but can be boring to watch so they have to do some rewrites to make it more suspenseful for TV.",

What\u2019s outside the silo? \n\nThe rest of the plot. Who cares? \n\nThe main actress has the personality of a wet carrot. Same facial expressions. No personality. The character is wheat bran. I don\u2019t really get it. \n\nShe comes alive during the action scenes with the generator but can\u2019t carry the dramatic scenes. \n\nCommon is the most interesting character. \n\nThe show is getting really bogged down with this homicide case. She goes from caring to wanting to quit because she met one woman that bad mouthed her deceased beaux. I guess it makes more sense that silo civilians are a little naive but they go from being really smart to really naive super fast. \n\nIt\u2019s super dark, super slow but started with a bang. This probably works better in the book but show adaptation needs to get to the point. \n\nI\u2019ve read a few of the foundation books. They\u2019re good but the show is actually better for what it is. They change a few things around but keep the core theme and it moves way better than silo. \n\nI really just can\u2019t wait for foundation to come back. Lol",

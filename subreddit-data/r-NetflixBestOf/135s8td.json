    "postText": "\u201cQueenmaker\u201d and \u201cWave Makers,\u201d two East Asian shows that were released within the span of a month, share a similar set-up, of an election campaign to put a woman in power. While \u201cQueenmaker\u201d spans a month, the latter takes place over ten months. We remember how excited we were for \u201cQueenmaker\u201d before it was released. We thought it was going to be a show the likes of which we had never seen before. We couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. It was as mediocre as it could get, and we will never forgive their lack of understanding of the difference between actual misogyny and the depiction of it. Maybe it was the disappointment of that, because of which we had no expectations from \u201cWave Makers.\u201d We approached it as part of a job to be done but were left thinking that it was content like this that made us take up this job in the first place.  \n\n\nThe point is that whoever wrote \u201cWave Makers\u201d did it with a working knowledge of advertising, campaigning, politics, and gender sensitivity. In short, they deserve a raise, whereas the other needs to do some more research. This is the show that literally came out of nowhere and swept us off our feet, something we had desperately wanted \u201cQueenmaker\u201d to do. We still haven\u2019t seen the story that we want to, that of the challenges a woman has to face when she aims for the highest seat of power in a country. Maybe if there is a season 2 of \u201cWave Makers,\u201d we will see Wen Fang, a queer woman, take the bull by its horns in her campaign for the councilor, the senator, or even better, the president. That would be a sight for sore eyes, and we would pay money to watch it. As for \u201cQueenmaker\u201d Season 2, we did not care about the first season, so the second one will have to really step up to interest us. Maybe they can hire Wave Makers\u2019 writers. Then they will have a good show.",

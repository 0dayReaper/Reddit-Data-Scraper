The film is an Italian-American venture produced by The Ladd Company, Embassy International Pictures, PSO Enterprises, and Rafran Cinematografica, and distributed by Warner Bros. Based on Harry Grey's novel The Hoods, it chronicles the lives of best friends David \"Noodles\" Aaronson and Maximilian \"Max\" Bercovicz as they lead a group of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships; love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, together with the rise of mobsters in American society.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Drag queens and drag kings are not usually labeled as cross-dressers/transvestites. Why? Good question, actually.  People that dress in drag tend to be gay and cross-dressers tend to be straight.\"\n\nSo maybe \"dressing drag\" is the best descriptor for DeNiro's role?\n\n[Source](http://www.askthegay.com/2010/10/what%E2%80%99s-the-difference-between-transsexual-transgender-transvestite-and-cross-dresser/)",

Unpleasant in plain old human ways. Like, you probably know people like this. Just for example, early in the movie the witches are drawing straws(entrails) and the main witch cheats.",

Then at some point  I realized it was absolutely beautiful, that it was not Dunsany style, it was with understanding of  the Fields We Don't Know. Much of the story is untold, much is just off screen (so to speak). I've re-read many times, including just this last week. And I still can't see where the (writing) magic happens. I have no real idea why I loved it but it works perfectly for me.\n\nUnlike say, *Neverwhere*, which I also just re-read. Also a great great book, but I can see where the greatness lies. Knights Bridge, the test, the Beast, these are standout wonderful moments. I can see how he made that work. \n\n",

                            "comment": "I'm going to agree with /u/GlobTwo, in a totally non-troll way.  First off, I should say that I've never been a fan of Gaiman's writing.  By all reports, he's an amazing human being, all-around smart guy, a rare example of ethics in the literary world...  But for whatever reason, his stories and/or style just don't resonate with me personally.  I'm happy there are people who enjoy his art, and if I had the chance I'd encourage him to continue creating.  But it's not my cuppa.  \n  \nBut even with my admitted bias right there on the table, I have to say I think this movie was pretty awful.  Every clever line was delivered in a manner that made you think it was designed to be quotable.  I got the feeling they wanted this to be the next Princess Bride.  But the thing is, the lines in the Princess Bride were delivered as lines that supported the movie itself.  The acting, particularly by DiNiro, was poorly done.  I've seen middle school anti-bullying roleplaying exercises with more believable characters.  Claire Danes is a wonderful actress, in dramatic roles.  Romantic roles, not so much.  We've seen her try a few times, and it's never really worked.  The dude who played the boy- the lead character- was so forgetful that I honestly can't recall his face or name.  Contrast that with just saying the words \"Buttercup and Wesley\" in a room full of people.  Half of them could probably draw a fair sketch of those characters.  Ninety nine percent could tell you what movie it was from.  \n  \nMaybe it's cruel to to stand up Stardust against The Princess Bride, but it's not like the producers of the film didn't ask for it.  Their marketing material, trailers, and all the hype made it out to be as if this was the next star in Hollywood's epic romantic comedy constellation.  Which, given the name of the movie, makes it even sadder to see how poorly it came off in comparison.",

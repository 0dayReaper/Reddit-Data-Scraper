While this is a drama, it's known for its wit and humor, which might appeal to your tastes.\n\n2. \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" - This is an American police procedural comedy television series. It's a light-hearted, funny show with a great ensemble cast that you might enjoy if you liked \"The Good Place.\"\n\n3. \"Fleabag\" - This British comedy-drama television series is about a confused, angry, free-spirited young woman living in London. The show's blend of comedy and drama might appeal to you if you enjoyed \"Dead to Me.\"\n\n4. \"Money Heist\" (La Casa de Papel) - This is a Spanish heist crime drama television series. The series traces two long-prepared heists led by the Professor, one on the Royal Mint of Spain, and one on the Bank of Spain.

The series balances comedy and drama and features numerous song-and-dance numbers throughout.\n\n7. \"Russian Doll\" - This is a comedy-drama series about a woman who repeatedly dies and relives the same night in an ongoing time loop. It's a fascinating blend of comedy, drama, and mystery.\n\n8. \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" - A comedy-drama series that follows a housewife in the 1950s who discovers she has a knack for stand-up comedy.",

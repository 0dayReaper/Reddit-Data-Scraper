This deliberately misrepresents some history that would\u2019ve really benefitted from being adapted at least somewhat accurately. \n\nBasically, it depicts real-world enthusiastic slavers as fictitious freedom fighters, and depicts them as voluntarily ending slavery much earlier than the time they were forced to end it. It feels oddly like propaganda for a people who don\u2019t exist anymore. \n\nI\u2019d say if you want to watch it, do. There\u2019s some neat stuff. But spend time on Wikipedia afterwards so you don\u2019t take away incorrect information.",

Reading the Wikipedia page or hitting the history books is exciting enough! A lot of human drama, tragedy, battle, and the march of time.

There were probably closer to 1,000 than 300. They also weren't fighting monsters and Xerxes wasn't a giant (he wasnt even there, why would he be?), but yeah I guess the fact that it brought some recognition to the actual events is a good thing.",

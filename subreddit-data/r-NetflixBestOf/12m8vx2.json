And what were that Haley-Luke creepy incest-y moments in the beginning episodes about, it was sooo weird?? Did anyone else notice it?  \n\nI love Modern Family and many things about this show and stilll loving it. but i feel quality has degraded a little quite noticeably. will it get better or going to be the same from here?",

I think they just like to banter because they\u2019re the \u2018social\u2019 siblings who are obsessed with dating so they get along and can joke around.",

I watched the entire two seasons over a period of 2-3 weeks, complaining to myself the whole time. Putting aside the forced love-triangles and other annoying elements, I really liked the world building, and the Crows storyline. The three (and later fourth and fifth) Crows were very interesting characters with good chemistry, although some YA elements did creep in there as well.",

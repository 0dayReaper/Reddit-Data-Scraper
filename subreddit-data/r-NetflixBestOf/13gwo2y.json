In a world where only 1 percent survived and it's so bad that there's not even enough oxygen how do people have new cars and mobile phones? The global supply chain would have collapsed. Where are they making all the new clothes, cars and whatnot? How did they invent the oxygen tech and build a city underground with only 1 percent of the population and the world wrecked? What are they eating and drinking? The world is a wasteland dessert with very little sunlight. The food chain would have collapsed and crops failed. None of it makes sense. \n\nI've already dropped it. It's really disappointing. It seems bizarre that Netflix pushed this so hard when it's a pretty terrible show.",

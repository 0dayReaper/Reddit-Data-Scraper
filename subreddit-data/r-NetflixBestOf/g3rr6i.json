Its not often that the follow up season is better than the introduction. They didn't fall into any of the traps of a second run, no \"adding characters\" just to add interest. I liked how they fleshed out the main protagonists, and used a real event in a relatable way...very well done.",

I think for me, although the second season was probably just objectively better having settled into the narrative, when I think of the show my first reaction is how it blew my mind after having zero expectations going into it. And that season 1 finale oh my lord \u2014 the last scene was just expertly crafted art that sits with me still more than anything else. Helps that the music was from my all time favorite band so maybe there\u2019s some bias there haha",

If a woman is upset, she almost always has support. But for men, even at their wits end, nothing most of the time. People don\u2019t care that men are 4 times more likely to commit suicide than women. People just don\u2019t care that men can have problems too, that they need support sometimes too. Why isn\u2019t that ok?\n\nEdit: Just wanted to thank everyone for sharing their opinions on this thread. It\u2019s made me see that there are a lot more people who care about this subject than I thought. I\u2019m sorry for coming across as bitter but when I posted this I was upset and shocked after seeing the difference between successful suicides between men and women. I do not hate women, or blame women for anything, I just wanted to post this as I know there are a lot of lonely men out there right now. People have shown me that I\u2019m not as educated on some matters as I thought I was, and I really need to get better at putting my thoughts into words so they aren\u2019t misinterpreted. Thank you for the silver and gold whoever gave them, and thank you all again for this discussion, I hope it stays with us.",

    "postText": "I thoroughly enjoyed Prison Break, The Mentalist, and Lost, although I must admit that I wasn't as fond of the last two seasons of Prison Break. I find myself drawn to shows where the characters employ their intellect to solve problems, much like Michael Scofield and Patrick Jane. Moreover, I have a penchant for adventure dramas, which might explain my fondness for Lost. While I have explored various shows over the past few years, these three series still hold a special place in my heart. \n\nIn addition to those mentioned, some other shows I greatly appreciate are The White Collar, Sons of Anarchy, Emily in Paris, The Walking Dead, and Black Mirror. Considering my preferences, I would greatly appreciate your suggestions for shows that share similarities with the ones I've mentioned.",

I tried watching The Diplomat after this and I couldn\u2019t get through 3 episodes because the acting is like watching a 6th grade play after Babylon.

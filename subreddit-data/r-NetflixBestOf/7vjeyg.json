She said that it never happens naturally; there are never so many snakes in a single area unless they were placed there. Apparently since the show was released, they\u2019ve had a lot of tourists asking them about it. It\u2019s really sad that the BBC interfered to get this footage since there\u2019s so much natural beauty in the islands; it\u2019s really unnecessary. ",

You\u2019re right that humans are prohibited from visiting certain parts of the archipelago, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that she is a wildlife expert who has an incredible amount of knowledge of the species that live in the Galapagos. Her explanation was that the snakes seen in the show don\u2019t live/hunt in groups- they\u2019re solitary. The BBC must have moved/grouped the snakes into that area for this scene. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sure that the BBC would deny influencing the situation.

Attenborough is out and about, squeezing in caves, chasing insects and slouching about with gorillas. My father thinking to tape the episodes for me, which I then watched over and over again for years, was a decision that has shaped my life; my interests, my values. In a sense it saved my life - at my lowest point, I fled my mundane and seemingly bleak life at home to see the sort of things I'd seen only with Attenborough. I've been up that river in Borneo, up that mountain in Rwanda, up in the air in Tanzania, up all night in Namibia. All because my dad saw I liked it and taped it for me. ",

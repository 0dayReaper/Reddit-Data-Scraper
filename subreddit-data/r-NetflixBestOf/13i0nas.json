    "postText": " I'm looking for movies **from the 2010's,** with **compelling characters**, and **a lot of really good dialogue** that'll make me feel something.\n\nI  prefer it be with likable characters, but feel free to recommend  something that doesn't have likable characters as long as you both warn me about it, and the characters are extremely compelling.\n\nI'm  also afraid that if I don't say please don't give me period piece I'll  get flooded with almost nothing but period pieces. Please prove that I  had nothing to worry about.\n\nEdit: To be clear, when I say movies, I mean as in PLURAL. I wanna watch like 2 or 3 movies like this over the next day or so.\n\nOh, and they don't necessarily have to be on netflix.",

You\u2019ll fall in love with all of the characters and their dialogue and chemistry with each other is so good and the characters stories will definitely make you feel something. And if you have time watch the second one and the third one which is currently in theaters.\n\nWhiplash. it\u2019s my favorite movie of all time, I definitely recommend that.\n\nInterstellar. You will definitely feel something during the scene where Cooper is watching the messages he got from his son while he was gone.",

Saw it in theatres too around the time of my birthday, and it was probably the best movie that I saw around the time of my birthday outside of the LOTR movies.\n\n**Whiplash** is about a wrestler, right? Yeah, I thought it was pretty good.\n\n**Interstellar** seems really promising. I definitely need to watch it with someone that understands it and can explain it to me as we watch it like I did with The Martian though(one of the best movie experiences of my life!), because from what I understand it's one of those movies that is way too smart for me.",

It turns out that they aren't. \n\nSeveral suggestions:\n\n\\- The Wind Rises (2013) by Miyazaki. It's absolutely beautiful. It's the fictionalized biography of a WWII aircraft designer who's engaged to a young woman with tuberculosis. You'll definitely feel something.\n\n\\- The Shape of Water (2017) by Guillermo del Toro. A period fantasy romance in which a woman falls in love with what's essentially the creature from the black lagoon, who's being kept on a government installation. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\n\\- Hail, Caesar! (2016) by the Coen Brothers. Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Tilda Swinton, Scarlet Johansson, and a bunch of other A-listers star in a dark comedy about 1950s Hollywood. Most of the movie is an excuse to perform elaborate set-piece scenes from 1950's-style movies that never existed. The funniest one is an elaborate musical number starring Channing Tatum in which a bunch of sailors complain that there \"ain't gonna be no dames\" when they go to sea.\n\n\\- The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) by Wes Anderson. Arguably Wes Anderson's best film. It's a dark comedy with an all-star cast in which an old man tells the epic story of how he went from being the \"lobby boy\" of a luxury hotel in the 1940s to owning the hotel, and how he won and lost the love of his life.\n\n\\- The Artist (2011). Not much dialog since it's a silent film, but it won the Academy Award for Best Picture. It's about a comedy-drama about silent film actor in the 1920s who is suffering a personal crisis because they want him to star in a talkie.\n\nLighter Fare:\n\n\\- Wreck-It Ralph (2012). A villain from a fictional 1980s video game travels around an arcade trying to reinvent himself as a hero. A lot of famous 80s and 90s video game characters make cameo appearances.\n\n\\- Zootopia (2016). An idealistic anthropomorphic rabbit becomes a police officer in a city where every kind of anthropomorphic animal lives. The plot deals with overcoming racism (in this case, it's predatory animals vs. prey animals). It won the Academy Award for best animated film.",

However the film is a reboot and doesn't treat the first film's plot as canon, despite Chan portraying the same character. The US release of the film in 2000 was entitled **The Legend Of Drunken Master**.\"*\n\nI prefer the original version, but it's probably because it was my first kung-fu movie.",

I have an old Hong Kong DVD release of it with the original language and ending. \n\nFun fact: Since they used actors that mainly spoke different dialects of Chinese, at the time most Hong Kong movies did all of their dialog in post with specialized voice actors. After Jackie Chan became a star in the west, they would get him to dub himself in the English releases of some of his films. So Chan's voice isn't in the original version (except when he sings the theme songs for some of his films), but is in the dub. ",

They also turned around these movies pretty quickly (Jackie used to do several movies a year), so the dubbing process was probably pretty quick.  I don't think they recorded any sound on-set, so all the sound effects were added in post, hence why they sound kinda cartoonish.\n\nI think they would also always prepare a Mandarin dub at the same time. The Hong Kong DVDs I used to collect would always come with both Cantonese and Mandarin audio tracks as well as both traditional and simplified Chinese subtitles. What made them great for collectors was that they were also usually region free and had English subs of varying quality. ",

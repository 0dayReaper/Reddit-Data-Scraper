I am currently watching a very good Chinese show with no english audio available, only subtitles and I am loving it..",

            "comment": "I noticed this phenomenon for the first time a few weeks ago. Some of my coworkers organized an Indian movie night where we ordered in Indian food. The movie was great, but it was so weird to not be able to look away from the screen for a second to eat without missing dialogue (in the end, we just had to pause the movie for all us non-Hindi-speakers to eat). My husband\u2019s French and I\u2019m English-Canadian, so we watch everything with subtitles. I rely on the subtitles a bit more for French content than English content, but if I look away, I can still follow enough to know what\u2019s going on\u2026 Not at all the case with Hindi, as it turns out :P I like watching movies with their original dialogue, but agreed, definitely requires an extra level of focus compared to something in your native language.",

            "comment": "No, not at all. I\u2019m deaf and have captions/subtitles on all the time. In fact, Netflix is pissing me off because mixed language shows have gaps in captions. \n\nFor example, Rough Diamonds has subtitles when characters are speaking Hebrew or Dutch, but not English. So I don\u2019t get 1/3 to 1/2 of the dialogue of the show, and according to Netflix support, that is deliberate. \n\nSame with Least Expected Day, a show about the Movistar cycling team. Italian and Spanish are subtitled accurately, English no caption or subtitles.",

Some of them are so bad  it makes me laugh during a sad scene.\n\nI do understand about the not being able to look away. It's hard to have fun conversations with friends if everybody has to read and comprehend at the same time",

However, I typically eat something for which you only need to glance down every once in a while (popcorn, pizza, oatmeal, smoothies). I agree with you that it would be awkward if you wanted to eat something which required more attention. I also would guess that I read a bit faster than you, since typically subtitles stay on the screen for long enough to take my eyes away from them for a bit and not have me miss anything.",

Fookin waTeva laaa oim trynaa be humble ere laaa ya. I don't want to say who reads faster than who or who is better than you but all I will say is that I CAN read FAST. See that I did not say that I read fast but I can read fast. But when you are gobbling up food of a vast amount at a rapid pace whilst watching something which is not in your native tongue(s) that has subtitle but no dub reading fastness and all that shit is out of the picture ok? Please do try to understand the situation oh dearie.",

If you go into the subtitle options, there will sometimes be an option for \"Audio Description\" or something similar. It's audio captioning for vision impaired folks, so it describes what is happening in the scene, like \"John walks over to the kitchen table and sits down\" or whatever.",

After some familiarity, while you won't pick up the language by just watching the shows, you will pick up on tone, which can be much different than English.  Like all languages, much of what is conveyed through conversation is in tone (It's why we get it so wrong sometimes in text.) \n\nI've been watching East Asian dramas pretty extensively for more than 10 years now and while I don't know Korean or Japanese or Mandarin or Cantonese or Thai, I can still have an enjoyable meal because I recognize the tone in which things are being spoken and some very very basic words/ideas.",

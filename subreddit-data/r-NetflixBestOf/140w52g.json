When I did a cursory search to make sure I hadn't mixed them up, it turns out this is considered a standalone sequel.  \n\nIncidentally, you should watch *Thomas in Love* from back in 2000. It's the \"Ur-Example\" of the screenlife format that I watched a couple years after its release in a sci-fi cinema class in film school. Prophetic in many ways.",

    "postText": "I recent finished watching my first k drama, Extraordinary Attorney Woo &amp; I absolutely loved it! One of the best shows I\u2019ve ever watched. I wanted to ask for recommendations on other k drama shows that are just as captivating &amp; interesting like that one. I also watched Hometown Cha Cha Cha which was also great. So, anything like those 2? I prefer romance drama.",

Especially how she handles her moral delimas with each case.\n\nI burned through all the episodes.  The storyline leaves the show open for another season.  Hoping!\n\nHaven't watched any other K shows to reccomend, sorry.",

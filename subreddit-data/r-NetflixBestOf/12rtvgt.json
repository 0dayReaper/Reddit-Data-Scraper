Being born in GA during the era may help make it more enjoyable, but I was genuinely surprised how much I enjoyed it last Friday.\n\nI hadn't seen it in decades, last watching the horribly dubbed version TBS used to sandwich between showings of The Beastmaster. That version has its own nostalgic charm, but the original is where its at.\n\nAs far as personal finance, it's a great story about how audacity and tenacity can help you achieve riches and glory!",

Season 4 is structured like a puzzle box--it's incredibly rewarding to dissect and reassemble over multiple rewatches.\n\nSo I've got the exact opposite opinion as thread OP. On the one hand, season 4 had slightly fewer of the things that AD shared with other good comedies (hilarious one-liners and instant-gratification sight gags). On the other hand, season 4 had many more of the things that set AD apart from everything else out there (structurally complex comedy i.e. punchlines that are either delayed and built up over entire episodes or just hidden in plain sight).\n\nI'd say AD season 4 is indeed *closest* to the heart and soul of AD--comedy that has utmost faith in its viewers' intelligence.",

And I was incredibly disappointed after my first viewing. \n\nBut when you watch it a second time you're going to see just how well done it really is, there's a lot of jokes you won't get the first time simply because you haven't seen later episodes. There's a lot happening in the backgrounds that tie things together too that you can't catch the first time cause you don't know what to look for. \n\nThere are certainly problems, the sets look different, lighting is different, there's green screen and actors aren't always actually together, some scenes go on for too long.\n\nBut there is amazing stuff too \"you've got some mice to scoop out of the sea\" \"same\" and so much more.\n\n",

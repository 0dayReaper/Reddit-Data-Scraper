            "comment": "It would be easier for me to list the ones I hate, I like a lot of them \nBut if I had to choose one from each season, the ones that personally impacted me the most were Beyond the Aquila Rift from S1, Ice from S2, and The Very Pulse of the Machine from S3.",

            "comment": "Great question! It\u2019s tough to decide. I wish Netflix made it even tougher by making seasons 2 and 3 longer.\n\nSEASON 1: \n\n**The Secret War**. Love a desperate last stand, and self sacrifice, a specialty of WW2 Soviets\n\n**Sonnie\u2019s Edge**. Amazingly cool creature design. Action is borderline too brutal.\n\nSEASON 2:\n\n**Snow in the Desert**. Cool world, cool characters, looks awesome.\n\n**All Through the House**. Watched it once, no desire to watch it again. Left an impression.\n\nSEASON 3:\n\n**Bad Traveling**. Great character interaction, really creepy monster.\n\n**In Vaulted Halls Entombed**. Had no idea where this one was headed, just got scarier and scarier. Great ending.",

            "comment": "It's pretty much your choices for me as well. I can pick out Beyond the Aquila Rift as S1 winner, but I really enjoyed most s1 episodes (Good Hunting, Sonnie's Edge, Zima Blue, Secret War, even Suits).\nIt's almost as difficult for me to pick any episode from S2. They all suck for me. If I had to I would pick Tall Grass.\n\nFrom S3, it's going to be Jibaro. I know Bad Traveling got it's fans, but Jibaro was pure art.",

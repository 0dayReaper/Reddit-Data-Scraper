What is going to be as good as :\nBreaking Bad, Harry Potter, Ted Lasso, Sex and the City original, Seinfeld, What We Do In the Shadows, South Park, .....? My brain is limping along trying unsuccessfully to watch: You, The Last Thing He Told Me, Discovery of Witches, Beef, and good grief the most disappointing is season 5 of Mrs. Maisel.\nHello? We are not dumb. Why do producers and writers feel the need to fill in every detail... Also, since I am curious, why do the actresses keep their mouths slightly open in an O shape now?",

Women are smart and know men think O is sexy and play along to get anything they want from men by doing O. I highly recommend O to both men and women. \n\nOn a serious note, there is nothing approaching the level of the excellent shows you mentioned. I gave up looking. There is an occasional spark of originality here and there, but most all of it boring, same old cliches. The one show that surprised me recently was The White Lotus on HBO. Not wow, but entertaining enough.",

            "comment": "I will include a lot of series that aren't on Netflix, since I don't think any of the series that you listed as your favorites are on Netflix.\n\n[**Ghosts (UK)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVYrr63k9vQ) (HBO) - bc you liked What We Do In The Shadows\n\n[**His Dark Materials**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APduGe1eLVI) (HBO) - bc you liked Harry Potter\n\n[**Insecure**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1qYxOF7TUs) (HBO) - bc you liked Sex and the City and also comedies (in general)\n\n[**The Sex Lives of College Girls**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgQ-ugHEhiA&amp;t=10s) (HBO) - bc you liked Sex and the City\n\n[**The Good Place**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29iKAAeRvI4) (Netflix) - bc you liked Ted Lasso and What We Do In The Shadows\n\n[**Sex Education**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd2ldTR-WpI&amp;t=10s) (Netflix) - bc you liked Ted Lasso\n\n[**Our Flag Means Death**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFE8ASwxmpA) (HBO) - bc you liked Ted Lasso and What We Do In The Shadows. Very sweet/fun/enjoyable, though didn't hook me as much as the other shows on this list. Some fun connections with WWDITS: one of the stars is Taika Waititi, co-star/co-creator of the original WWDITS movie and co-creator of WWDITS the show. The lead actor Rhys Darby is also a frequent collaborator of the creators of WWDITS and acted in the original movie. There are a couple other guest stars of WWDITS that appear in one episode of Our Flag Means Death.\n\nMaybe:\n\n[**Bojack Horseman**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1eJMig5Ik4) (Netflix) - I feel like this one needs a bit more explaining, but I'm including it bc it is by far one of my favorite series. Recommending bc you liked the comedies you listed - the wry satire, the acerbic, dark humor, the absurdist humor (WWDITS), the fast-talking back and forth dialogue of Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and Ted Lasso, and the references and wordplay of Ted Lasso specifically (Bojack Horseman's wordplay is unparalleled, and v funny). Also bc you liked the dark character arc of Breaking Bad where he rationalizes doing terrible things (although Bojack is hardly on the same level of evil as Walter White; he's also mentally ill and haunted by his actions). Bojack Horseman is more emotionally intimate and therefore probably heavier/more depressing than Breaking Bad. Oh and Aaron Paul stars in Bojack, too (and his character looks like himself and kind of reminds me of Jesse).\n\n[**Acapulco**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8YKi_05emo) (Apple TV) - bc you liked Ted Lasso. This is a maybe bc I haven't seen it yet myself. It's been on my radar bc I liked the trailer and it gets good reviews. Recently, I have seen a number of people recommend Acapulco to people who liked Ted Lasso, which has even more convinced me to check out this show. Also one of the cast of Ted Lasso, Dani (Cristo Fern\u00e1ndez) was apparently just added to the cast of Acapulco.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I am curious, why do the actresses keep their mouths slightly open in an O shape now?\n\nWhat are you talking about?",

The O thing is really strange, and maybe one reason all these series bothered me.  Check out Jennifer Garner in The last thing he told me, Naomi Watts in The Watcher, the actress in You (can't remember her name), Jessica chasten is really bad about it also.  It remember noticing it the first time 15 years ago or so when Twilight movie came out.  Kristen Stewart is a master at this... really bothersome.  Thanks for the suggestions!",

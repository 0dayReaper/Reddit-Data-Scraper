However I wouldn't push others to watch the 2nd and 3rd, just let them know they exist and if they want to watch it they can.\n\nAnother bad movie that's also kinda good is 'exam'. Similar concept.

It's the only movie he directed, of which I've seen, that didn't include Muppets. It's pretty good but I have weird taste and this is a pretty weird movie. It used to be on YouTube, but at some point they took it down.",

The production was produced and directed by puppeteer and filmmaker Jim Henson, and was one of several experiments with the live-action film medium which he conducted in the 1960s, before focusing entirely on The Muppets and other puppet works. The screenplay was co-written by long-time Muppet writer Jerry Juhl.\n\nThe teleplay only aired twice: first on February 23 of 1969, with a rerun on February 21 of 1971.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27",

There were 100 rooms in the heart and everyone started in a different room. Every 10 minutes the rooms would shut, everyone not in a room died, and everyone in a randomly selected room would die. Then all the rooms except the randomly selected room opened again and the process would start over but with 99 rooms. The game proceeded until there was one room remaining at which point the survivors would be freed. I don't know what lethal combination of 4 corners and Pajama Sam I had that day but I definitely didn't play Pajama Sam for months.",

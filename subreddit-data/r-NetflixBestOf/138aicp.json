I know that Bob Berchtold was a sleazebag criminal who conned and manipulated Jan's parents but they were way too naive and Jan suffered tremendously because of it.  By the time the parents realized what was going on, Jan had been brainwashed.  I am glad that Jan finally snapped back to reality after her 16th birthday when nothing happened as Bob had said it would.  It had been four years of mental, emotional, and physical abuse which had devastated her.  It was horrible to think of everything he did to that family.  It kept my attention but I still have trouble understanding how one man could have such a hold on one family. The things Bob did were disgusting.",

So it's filled with people who will believe anything. Plus the church demands unquestioning obedience, so they are primed for that as well.\n\nYou think it's a coincidence that B became Mormon?

The main reason is that almost all of them base their scripts on a book written by one of the former branch davidians. The truth is that there's ample evidence that the davidians burned themselves to death, and none of these documentaries really go into depth about Koresh's pedophilia. They always show him marrying young girls, but they keep the age pretty high. So it feels manipulative but not pedophilic, especially when the actors are older. The reality is that he was a kiddy fucker.",

Could we really call it a documentary? It\u2019s more of a magnesium dumpster fire; it stinks and it\u2019s blinding. Don\u2019t watch it.  \n\nIf you want an example of a documentary/video essay that actually does the \u201cremind the audience of their role in civilization when it comes to civil issues\u201d intent *right*, a certain Jacob Geller on YouTube has a recent video about federal executions in America. I know that\u2019s not Netflix, and not a traditional documentary, but it *is* an educational piece\u2014if that\u2019s what you\u2019re aiming to see here, something that\u2019ll help you learn and think about a subject, I\u2019d recommend that.",

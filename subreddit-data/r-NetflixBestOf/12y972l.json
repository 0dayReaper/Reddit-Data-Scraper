That said, its a character study of abhorrent people, you're not meant to root for them but rather be horrified by the insight that this is how much of the world's richest and most powerful people live - driven by petty vendettas, bruised egos, and a desire for wealth and power without knowing what they'll do with it if they succeed. Its characters are written with exquisite attention to the most minor of details, amazing psychological depth and complexity, and truly witty (but incredibly vulgar) dialogue. On top of that, the acting is utterly stellar.\n\nI had a tough time connecting with it on first viewing partly because the characters didn't seem to face any serious challenge (they're wealthy people arguing over being slightly more wealthy) and partly because of their truly venal  personalities. It grew on me quickly though. It might help to think of it in the same way as a True Crime show. You don't watch them because you empathise with serial killers but because you're constantly thinking \"How on earth can someone be that awful?\" and you know that there are other people out there just like that.",

They\u2019re the wrong people to trust and influence politics. Conversations aren\u2019t about communication but about what isn\u2019t being said. Expectations are high and parental love is conditional. Everything is transactional.\n\nNo place feels like home despite that they have homes everywhere. Their investments are international and they live globally. They are beyond reach of the law or accountability. They know everyone but are close to no one.\n\nI read that the \u201cwealth advisers\u201d on set told the art directors not to bother with coats and umbrellas for the actors - people at this level of wealth are dropped off by a chauffeur at private entrances, they have private planes, they aren\u2019t touched by rain, they never stand in line or are ever told no. \n\nIn Season 2 you begin to see how the adult \u201ckids\u201d became who they are, and how limited their view of the world can be while trapped in a gilded cage with no real values (parental love is transactional). We learn how unwise Ivy League grads can be.\n\nThe show is based loosely on the Murdock family with some smatterings of the Kennedys, the royal family, Sumner Redstone and others.",

I find myself intrigued \nby the complexities within the characters\u2019 relationships and the way that money, power and greed drive them to forge blindly ahead. I\u2019m so glad I gave it another chance, thank you!",

They just drop you into a moment in an ongoing story and you have to pick up on the conversations, relationships, insinuations, etc and figure it out from there. They deliberately don't introduce a clear protagonist, or a clear story-start. You feel as if you missed a pilot episode, because you did. They did this with Peep Show as well. \n\nIf you do end up enjoying it, I'd say start over again from the beginning and all the confusing stuff will become clear and funny/rich/interesting. I don't want to be one of those people who says, 'oh you have to watch all of it, and then watch it again to get it,' because I hate that (see my comments about Schitt's Creek below) ...but if you do find yourself getting into it, that second watch is *very* rewarding.",

Will she struggle to understand the language? Will she be regarded with suspicion? \n\nNope. The author has never done an ounce of historical research for it (or if she has, she's brazenly bulldozed through it) so it became insultingly stupid within a few minutes. She has no ear for language (calling Jamie 'a romantic ' is utterly meaningless in early 18th century, for example). Unlimited wardrobe. Allowed to sit in on Jacobean rebellion meetings as an English woman of dubious background? And so on and so on. Gah. It was an insult to any thinking person's intelligence.\n\nHuh.

I watched it all, and it was ok, but that\u2019s all it ever was. If an entire season sucks, it\u2019s not the greatest tv show ever made (just my opinion, I understand folks feel VERY differently and I\u2019m not trying to start a war!)",

Characters like McNulty in The Wire are a great example of how to write deeply flawed humans who are still likeable - Rust and Marty were both intensely unlikeable in my mind so I did not find it enjoyable to follow their story.  Also all my friends talk about what a great twist the story had but I legitimately don't get what they're talking about.\n\n(*Hence why I don't enjoy The Boys either.)",

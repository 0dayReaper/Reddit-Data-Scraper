Although, we did list a whole bunch of alternate options in r/NetflixDVDRevival, so there's a good chance he could find even an older, obscure film from a legitimate source. Sounds like he's already willing to pay.\n\nBut if those options fail him, then nothing wrong with stealing then, in my opinion. It would actually be better if he got his hands on a download of the film, considering how obscure it would be by that point. A film that obscure might be in danger of becoming entirely lost. So by keeping a download, he's actually helping to preserve the film at that point.",

It is available, although currently it says \"Very long wait\", which probably means that they only have a small number of copies and other people have it in their queue. \n\nNormally the thing to do is put it at the top of your queue and enjoy other movies while you wait for it to come. The service will be running for 5 more months. I'll be there till the end, watching as much as I can!  \nYou can sign a petition to show interest in keeping the service open here:  \nhttps://www.change.org/p/petition-for-netflix-to-keep-their-dvd-program  \nYou can find a list of alternatives to the service here:  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixDVDRevival/",

I like a lot more variety and watch a lot of older movies, foreign films, and stuff like that. Sure you can rent those digitally one at a time, but it's usually around $4 a pop for a digital rental, but that adds up fast. Netflix DVD is only $10 a month, so that's a far more affordable way to get access to tons of good movies.\n\nTheir app/website also has a much better rating system than their streaming service (5 stars versus thumbs up/down). I find that lets me do a better job of rating movies more accurately, and that way their algorithm does a fantastic job of predicting new movies that I will like. Most of the time it is accurate within 1 star of how I will actually rate the movie after watching it.\n\nReally sad that we will be losing all that in 5 months.",

I'm glad you get it :)\n\nYes, streaming is convenient, but it's also important to remember that the vast majority of films are not available through the major streaming subscriptions. It's important to preserve these as a record of film history, and also for people of all film tastes to enjoy. \n\nPhysical media is an big part of that, because it preserves the films in a fixed state, not subject to the whims of streaming license deals, which are constantly changing what's available on any given streaming service. If you can find the disc, then you can rent/buy the movie, and no streaming license deal can stop you. \n\nPhysical media also preserves the film the way it was when the director approved the final cut before printing. Sometimes when films are put out for streaming, they will lose some A/V quality due to compression, or are even edited for censorship or other reasons. But once a film is printed on disc, it will remain as the director/studio intended as long as the disc survives.\n\nGlad you mentioned Shudder. That's one of the alternate options we identified on our list. The good news is that we found a video rental store in Seattle called Scarecrow Video, who has a huge collection of over 145,000 titles on disc. They also rent via mail, so anyone in the country should be able to have access. \n\nIt's not as streamlined or affordable as Netflix DVD though. Which is why we have listed many different options. I suspect that most users looking to replace Netflix DVD will survive on a combination of options: maybe a streaming service for convenience, along with an alternative rental service for the more obscure films, and maybe the occasional use of Scarecrow Video for those truly rare movies.",

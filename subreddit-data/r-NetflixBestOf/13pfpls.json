It shows conflicts between the Mongol empire and muslims under their reign and the crusaders.. sadly it got cancelled after s02. The fun thing about it that it has an assassin character (hashashin) from that era, our protagonist also got to show Order of Assassins (hashashins) practices. So, if you like Assassin's Creed, I guess you'd love that show.",

MC is not just book smart...military genius, new head of a family, lots of political stuff.\n\nHave you read any books by KJ Parker? I feel like his type of stories might suit you. Maybe start with The Seige series.\n\nIf you don't mind slow reads, the Thief series by Turner features a MC (titular Thief) who...basically  makes everyone chronically underestimate him, to their own misfortune...really great character work.\n\nFinally Vorkosigan series by Bujold features a brilliant but physically disabled MC who basically gets into space hijinks and survives on his cunning and determination. This is a looong series that follows him throughout this life with lots of spinoffs and short stories too. Start with Warrior's Apprentice.",

            "comment": "Thank you, everyone! I made a list of all your suggestions and I just suggested 5 that I thought she'd really like. But this list is fantastic \u2014 some of this is stuff I know and love, and other is stuff I haven't seen but now I'll watch.\n\nIt turns out she'll go home on Monday but she's been there 8 days already and is super bored. I didn't realize how bored she was or how long she'd be there or I would've made more of an effort before now. I plan to text her some jokes and interesting fun facts.\n\nI didn't want to overwhelm her but I'm saving all your suggestions for next time she has to go to the hospital. (She's in pretty good health but has an amputated leg because of circulation issues - not diabetes and she's not overweight, just a genetic thing. Her leg gets infected sometimes and she has to keep going back for antibiotics and such. But today she said she's not in any pain, just bored.)\n\nThank you all again! This means so much to me that I can come here and instantly get dozens of recommendations. Y'all restore faith in humanity.\n\nHere are the five shows I recommended:\n\nMy Octopus Teacher  \nFantastic Fungi  \nGreat British Baking Show  \nCunk on Earth  \nInside the Mind of a Cat (I added that one when I saw it next to Fantastic Fungi. She loves cats.)",

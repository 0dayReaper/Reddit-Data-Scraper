Zombies, by definition, are the \"living dead\".  \n\nI don't really care that 28 Days Later is considered a Zombie movie.  It isn't in the strictest sense; it's an infection movie... just like I Am Legend isn't a zombie movie (it's more a Vampire movie). ",

The script was written in part by Matheson, but he was dissatisfied with the result and chose to be credited as \"Logan Swanson\". William Leicester, Furio M.

                    "comment": "I used to hate fast zombies. This movie changed my mind.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I know. Just hear me out.\n\nLet me compare zombies to some other movie tropes. Take quicksand for example. Back through the 60s, there were a bunch of films where the hero got trapped in quicksand. But it wasn't actually quicksand. What was going on in the social consciousness of the time? You go off to a land far away and walk out into the middle of the jungle. Then you get trapped there. The more you try and fight to escape, the more it sucks you in. Quicksand is not quicksand. Quicksand is the Vietnam War.\n\nNow lets talk asteroid impact films. Back in the late 1990s there were a bunch of asteroid impact films. Again, what was going on in the social consciousness of the era? There is a looming disastar. We know the exact second that civilization is going to end. And the only thing we can do to fight it is hope that the efforts of a bunch of nerds and scientists pay off. But we cant know if their plan worked until that second comes. Asteroid impact is not asteroid impact. Astroid impact is the Y2K bug.\n\nOne more. In the 1950s, Japan made lots of Godzilla films. But what was going on in the social consciousness of the time? here is this enormous thing that came to the country from the pacific ocean, it was created by nuclear power, and was going around destroying their cities. And nothing could be done to counter it. Godzilla is not Godzilla. Godzilla is atomic bombs.\n\nThats why I hate fast zombies. What is in the social consciousness at the time zombies are in every media? Well, when the doors and windows are all boarded up, you only have so much food and water left. You still have to eat, but you can watch in dread as the food supplies get lower and lower. Eventualy you will have to be faced with a tough choice. Stay and starve, or go outside and face the zombies. Zombies are not zombies. Oil reserves emptying out + bees dying off + running out of helium + drought. This is why fast zombies make no sense. Its as if in an asteroid film the asteroid chased you down a street, turned around corners, followed you up a fire escape as you tried getting away. the entire metaphore is lost if you have the asteroid / zombie chase you instead of being a looming background force.\n\nBut .....\n\nThen comes the film 'Train To Busan'. Well, what is going on in the social consciousness of South Korea? And no, its not North Korea. As much as click-bait \"news\" websites in america like to write opinion pieces abotu how Trump is going to start WWIII, for the people actually from South Korea this is just business as usual. No, what freaks them out is gwarosa. Obsessive Job Culture and death from overwork. Your job is everything. And you work and you work and you work and you live at the office and it consumes you every single second of every single day and you dont dare slip up not even once because if you suffer the slightest misstep there are a thousand other people right behind you that want your job. Its no coincidence that the protagonist of the film is a fund manager and that the first act is totally given over to building the story of how he is never with his family because he is working all the time. Zombies are not zombies. Zombies are unemployment.",

Definitely one of the greatest horror movies of all time and I've seen **a lot**, from Martyrs to The Shining. Like those films, it goes above just being a genre film, it's a great film, period. One other example on Netflix is \"Raw\", probably more thriller than horror but, again, it surpasses genre. The less you know about it the more fun it is--but I promise that if you like Stanley Kubrick you'll like \"Raw\". Shock of a story if you can abstain from looking it up, wickedly sumptuous  cinematography, and a true sense of horror creeping up your spine.",

Oldboy, 3 Iron, The Host, Joint Security Area, Man From Nowhere, I'm A Cyborg But That's OK...the list goes on and on.\n\nBut I have to disagree with you about Oldboy being the best revenge flick. While Oldboy is absolutely my favorite movie of all time, I think that I Saw The Devil is better as a revenge genre film. It puts an interesting twist on the idea, while still maintaining all the revenge film tropes. It's not for the faint of heart though, as it is easily one of the most violent and graphic films I've seen. I've definitely seen much worse, but it's up there, and I know that how graphic it is isn't for everybody.\n\nIt's really good though and I highly recommend it to everyone that likes graphic violence in film.",

I got hooked on Korean movies so much so that I actually looked into learning Korean because I'm horrible at reading subtitles. Luckily though, Korean language is slower (or longer...not sure how to put it) so I have time to read. I have trouble keeping up Chinese and Japanese.\n\nSo, back to I Saw The Devil - I was blown away by it. It does such an amazing job of making you question \"how far would I go in that situation\", while making realize your own boundaries\n\nAnother decent movie is The Tower. About a building that catches fire and people have to get out. It's got its cliches, but still a good watch",

Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 96% approval rating based on 78 collected reviews, with an average rating of 7\\.6 out of 10\\. The site's consensus states\\: \"Train to Busan delivers a thrillingly unique  \u2013 and purely entertaining \u2013 take on the zombie genre, with fully realized characters and plenty of social commentary to underscore the bursts of skillfully staged action\". Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film an average score of 72 based on 15 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Clark Collis of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the film \"borrows heavily from World War Z in its depiction of the fast-moving undead masses while also boasting an emotional core the Brad Pitt-starring extravaganza often lacked,\" adding that \"the result is first-class throughout.\" The film received a coveted \"The New York Times Critics' Pick\" badge, with reviewer Jeannette Catsoulis taking notice of the film's subtle class warfare.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Busanhaeng+%282016%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Train%20to%20Busan), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/train_to_busan/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/train-to-busan), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q20948236).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F7c2gcv \"Confidence: 1.01\").

I've gotten tired of the comedy genre's take on zombie films and the action/fantasy/drama zombie films are just too predictable and bland and cheesy (they usually feel like something is missing to me).\n\nNow, maybe it's because Train to Busan is Korean with a Korean cast and a Korean take/approach (culture, story, filmmaking formula) but it felt like I was watching something innovative and new to the zombie genre. And maybe it's because they are Korean that I also did not feel like it was as cheesy and dramatic and predictable as western zombie films. Almost like I could forgive the flaws I would normally hate in western films, BECAUSE it was a Korean film. I don't know why.\n\nLooking back on it though, maybe that last death scene was a little bit prolonged. It would have probably been the right amount for an emotional hook if it was shorter and less dramatic. Still a good movie in my opinion. A good movie to watch casually that has some heavy emotion.",

And it does it so often there's no tension because they do eventually move every time, so it just slows it down. I feel like this is 90 minutes of tense horror packed into two hours.\n\nWatch [REC] instead if you want a good, claustrophobic, fast paced zombie movie.",

He doesn\u2019t love subtitles, but I have to use them, but honestly with this movie the fact that it was subtitled didn\u2019t bother him at all. We were both completely engrossed. Absolutely watch this movie if you like thrillers/horror. It managed to be so incredibly emotional, and was a beautiful depiction of the facets of humanity that come out in a crisis. From courage and heroism to fear and tribalism. It had me crying like a baby at points. ",

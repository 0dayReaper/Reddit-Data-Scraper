I got about 4 or 5 episodes in, got a hint of what was going on, and said; \"These are all miserable characters and I don't care how many different timelines they are miserable in.\"\n\nAfter the last season arrived, all the hype I saw convinced me to put my helmet on and get back in there. I finished the show, just treating it more as a morbid curiosity rather than something that would ever make me *feel good*. \n\nThe one thing I like to point out to people now is that the show is relentless with a trick I've seen in plenty of other stuff, too. When they need the audience to come to a realization or have a rush of dopamine or something every so often they'll do it. There will be a building crescendo of dramatic music, set to a montage of characters looking at things or emoting, all the while a voice will be slowly reading a monologue that sounds like it means something super-heavy. It tricks the viewer into thinking they are 'realizing' something much deeper than they actually are, and when you *really* listen to what the voice is saying without the emotional tie-in to the characters on screen, it's really just fluff, delivered in such a super-serious way. Anyway, I started almost laughing at these bits because by the end of the show they were leaning on them really hard.",

People either gonna totally love it or don\u2019t be into it at all. So if you don\u2019t really like the show while being  couple of episodes into it, it might be just not your cup of tea",

No show that's ever been made is for everyone, not the Sopranos, Breaking Bad, or any others . Everyone has their cups of teas, those two shows just so happen to be more people's cup of tea than any others, but there's bound to be people who aren't into them.",

Donnie Darko does small town intrigue and existential crisis much better and in far less time. After the conclusion of Sark you are left knowing hat it was all filler and meaningless.

Like I enjoy doing things around the house while watching Netflix, but I can\u2019t really do that with Dark unless I turn on the English dub, but then that makes the show almost unbearable for me. It was the same thing with Squid Games. I pretty much had to force myself to sit down and watch them cause I KNEW so many people loved them, so that was enough motivation for me to go all in.

We meet up every couple of weeks to watch movies, and would generally watch a movie and an episode of something.\n\nWe got about four episodes into it before giving it up, but I think the show suffered from the way we went about it.  It is slow (at least the first episodes) and watching only one episode every couple of weeks made it hard to remember the details and maintain interest.  I am certainly very interested in it and will try it out again some time, but when I do I will make sure that I can binge it - I think that would work a lot better.",

It's just too slow-paced, and I couldn't really feel anything for the characters. They could have told the same story in half the time.\n\nThe premise is interesting, but again I think they could have told the story in a more engaging way.",

On paper it sounds like exactly the kind of show I\u2019d love, but the execution of the concept is so poor that I had to force myself to finish it, and it never got better. (It is visually beautiful though!) It\u2019s like something that is meticulously planned out but has nothing below the surface, it\u2019s just empty. Other people have no problem with that and love it, which is cool. But for me, a part of something feeling real is if there seems to be more there, like this is happening in a well thought out imagined world which has other things going on that aren\u2019t a part of the story, as if it is a real world. This has none of that, it\u2019s the story, it\u2019s on the surface, and beneath it is nothing else.",

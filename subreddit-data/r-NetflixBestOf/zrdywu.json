At some point they also offered the Snack Card program where you get a free snack for every rental transaction in-store.  This includes your \"free\" trade-in swaps.

Streaming libraries are not the entertainment paradise we might have imagined them to eventually become years ago, and there are so many better options that are only available by DVD. I think there's a lot of value in a BluRay burner.",

So, how many you could get in a week would depend on the turnaround. Mine was three or four days, depending on where the disc was being sent from. There wasn't a cap, but there was a practical limit. I seem to recall that at some point they stopped sending a new disc out the same day the old one was received, to slow things down a bit.",

(Had to hide them because my stepdad was aggressively anti piracy, down to refusing to use adblockers on his devices despite working in IT)\n\nI got Netflix myself when they added a client to the Xbox 360 during my college days that came with the disc delivery, but I stopped the disc side pretty quick since I was really bad about returning them in a timely fashion.",

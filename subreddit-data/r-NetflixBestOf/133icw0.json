If you\u2019re in your early twenties, I suggest shows like Bridgerton, Wednesday, Shadow and Bone, The Umbrella Academy, Enola Holmes, Sweet Tooth. There\u2019s not much bad influence like drugs, alcohol or anything but just a protagonist and antagonist. If you\u2019re looking for something more happy and comforting and don\u2019t mind other languages, maybe you should try watching kdramas. Some of my favourites are True Beauty, The Business Proposal, Alchemy of Souls, Hometown Cha Cha Cha.",

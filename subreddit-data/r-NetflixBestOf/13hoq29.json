I need another series which is along the lines of a teen drama which manages to be funny, intriguing and emotional all at the same time. i know it\u2019s a long shot to get something so niche but would anyone have an idea?",

My parents read me the books around that age too, and looking back some of them were quite disturbing\u2026 weirdly frequent themes of decapitation throughout the series. I was a talented and gifted kid (undiagnosed autistic) and  I learned a lot of the 1910s vernacular from the Oz books. Picture a 4 year old saying \u201cI\u2019m having luncheon with my companions\u201d\u2026 It was a huge part of my childhood. I recently got another tattoo of Polychrome ascending back into the sky on the rainbow. Definitely an Ozma tattoo coming next!",

It is quite unknown, it\u2019s about teenies in a school for girls (obviously), about bullying and revenge. it\u2019s an Arabic series.",

I didn't like most of the new cast and have actually lost interest in the most recent season.\nSomething very similar happened with Riverdale. First season had me super engaged, then it's like the writers started taking drugs and everything becomes ridiculous and impossible to believe.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am a university student from the Netherlands, and I am currently researching viewers\u2019 perceptions of poc characters from the Netflix show *Sex Education* for my bachelor thesis. My study explores how the multi-dimensional, layered, and relatable portrayal of characters of color relates to different viewers' engagement with them.\n\nI am looking for some more diversity in my respondents (in particular, **I need more insights from people of color**). If you have watched *Sex Education*, I would really appreciate it if you could take some time to fill out this short 5-10 minute survey. This will not only help me graduate, but it will also contribute to the wider understanding of why good diversity representation on TV is important. Your insights are greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!!\n\nLink to survey: [https://erasmusuniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_ahizowKbmd3W1mK](https://erasmusuniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ahizowKbmd3W1mK)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/80prauehhuva1.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ce0de17087da4a89b124380f9f66933ace8913ca",

Sure, but it's doable. \n\nWalk before breakfast for about 20 mins to kickstart metabolism. Eat a good breakfast of some good fats, protein, and good carbs. Like eggs, avocados, and oatmeal. \n\nEat a snack sometime mid morning. Like almonds or beef jerky (which you can make at home for about $10), then eat a decent lunch of meat and veggies. Chicken, flank steak, fish (anything but talapia) and some veggies, add some brown rice to keep you full. \n\nAnother snack maybe some raw veggies like carrots with hummus, or some raw sweet peppers. \n\nDinner can be similar to lunch, maybe a little smaller or a little bigger depending on hunger/activity levels. \n\nFind some time to walk/jog for about 30mins to an hour. \n\nDon't even have to be that strict. Can also just watch calories and walk 30-60mins a day and people will be healthy. \n\nYou won't be jacked, but you'll be healthy. ",

It would be the rest and down time that would allow your body to repair itself. A poor man would have to keep working and get minimum amount of rest as he would also have to do other chores around the house. A rich man could be working the same amount and not have to worry about everything else. ",

Its great in that its a very well done, very satisfying action movie. Great at being what its trying to be.

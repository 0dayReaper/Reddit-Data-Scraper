All of the little details, from the beginning scene with Emily getting the little kid to go criticize the not-white janitor to the white women repeatedly saying they'll be fine because they're white and they're friends with cops to the ending. I wrote about it a bit more here, shameless plug to another comment of mine: [https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/tdcu0e/comment/j502j4f/?utm\\_source=reddit&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/tdcu0e/comment/j502j4f/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) . We need different sub-categories of horror for movies like this because it contains \"horrific\" events, but it's not \"horror\" in the traditional sense people think of with scenes meant to scare the viewer in the literal sense of jump scares/ghosts/demons/zombies. But it is scary in a very different way, of course.",

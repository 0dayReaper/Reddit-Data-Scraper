                            "comment": "Spoilers abound as the ending is discussed: [The ending is not necessarily a twist; it is far from unexpected. However, much of the tension and drama of the film come from the angle that the protagonist can only *suspect* what is happening, as every accusation is met with reasonable and almost vindicating explanations. One big example was that his most damming accusation about the missing guest is completely debunked in a big way at such a crucial time. Every opportunity to leave the situation in a civil manner is met with equally civil hindrances. He (along with the audience) *suspects* malevolent intentions from the very beginning, but there is never any truly compelling evidence that would justify an abrupt and forceful exit. So we (along with Will) *feel* like something is very wrong, but don't truly **know** as all evidence shown to us is very directly confronted and countered. So to absolutely know ahead of time the intentions of the hosts leaves no room for doubt and puts you out of sync with the protagonist, making the film much less absorbing. I would guess that it would even be a bit frustrating watching the film with no room for doubt.](/spoiler)\n\nTL;DR\nYou are meant to suspect what is happening from the beginning, but to truly know the outcome ahead of time ruins the intentions of many of the scenes (and the film as a whole).",

It starts predictably, but still seems like a good movie with pretty decent acting. It's fun putting the puzzle together throughout the movie. [The girl that leaves early, being followed by Mr. I Killed My Wife](/spoiler)\n\nThe turning point for me was when [the male asian dude gets to the party after the phone call saying he was there. At that point, all my suspicions were in doubt. We actually paused the movie here to discuss how the rest of the 20 or so minutes would play out. Keep in mind this is a murdery thriller and NOBODY is confirmed murdered yet. My bet was that it was going to end as some psych break of the main character](/spoiler)\n\nOverall, even if you are able to predict it, the movie gives a good flavor to the genre and is very well done.",

Go top of the board and like 30-5 without using vehicles and it's pretty damn exciting. Or even just pulling off a great shot, or a multi-kill. Just because you don't get a feeling of reward for it doesn't mean there isn't one for everyone. There's more to it in BF1 for me than most games, IMO. Because as Westworld says, for someone to win, someone's gotta lose. Competition is exciting. You also notice a huge difference in your skill level after putting in the time, which is pretty great. It's not quite on the level of something like WoT, but it's nice. ",

The film is predictable, but that's what adds to the suspense for me. The way the film is going seems so *obvious* that I found myself second guessing. Maybe he is crazy and all the creepy shit is just from his viewpoint? It can't be so obvious that the antagonists are crazy people, can it? When a film like this presents itself in such a straightforward manner, I can't help but think it must be hiding something. For me, that effect alone put me in the shoes of the main character. You're watching, wondering how it can be so obvious while the main character is doing the same thing. Is the film perfect? Hell no! But I enjoyed the central character's path through the film and loved the 0-100 ending.](/spoiler) ",

A waste of time.   \n\n==========MILD-SPOILER WARNING==========\n \nMovies of this nature that are good? Hurm, that is a tough one. I am not really into some....\n\n==========MILD-SPOILER WARNING==========\n \n...psychotic, cultish movies like this one. I dont mind people talking, I enjoyed *The Man From Earth* so much, so it was not about the *conversation-heavy* feature of the movie. I actually enjoyed movies like **the purge**, where there are actions and consequences... a few jump-scares here and there, and nothing too depressing, everyone keeps on moving, but there are pauses. In *The Invitation*, the \"hero\" was quite depressing, bordering being a *loser*, everything so so fucking slow up till the end.  \n   \nAll in all, it is really frustrating when the director/writer dumps a load of hint of the actual nature of the *hosts* but we are trapped with the *loser's* inability to make a stand for the sake of him and his wife, and getting the fuck out of the house. He could have but no, he wouldn't want to hurt his *hosts'* feelings by doing that now would he?\n\nSo yeah, overall very annoying having being driven by that loser of a protagonist.  \n\nedit: out of the top of my head: Vacancy (2007) was good, at least better than The Invitation ",

Where death is the answer to life's problems.\n\nHe got invited to a mini reunion with their mutual friends. He brought his wife and introduced her to everyone (some of his friends have met his wife before). The group mingled and was introduced to the cult by the hosts (the ex wife, her new husband, and 2 strangers, also from the cult). They were shown a video of someone commuting \"gentle-suicide\" because she had cancer and that it was the way   to go.\n\nHe suspected something amiss and questioned the hosts repeatedly and was told by them and the group that he was just being paranoid.\n\nAfter they had dinner he got another panic attack and stopped everyone from drinking from the wine glass. Everyone thought that he was crazy when he hit a girl-host, who went unconscious. \n\nHe missed one, a woman-guess drank the wine and immediately died with her mouth foaming. The hosts' plan was foiled (they wanted to poison the guests) so they whipped up a gun and started hunting and skilling everyone. \n\nHe faught back along with his wife. Finally 3 people survived including a gay man whose gay partner died. They left the house and found that plenty of other houses including the one they were in had purple colored light displayed... Sirens and helicopters were heard in the background. It was clear that it was the night the cult were meant to have its members invite and murder their guests... For salvation?\n\nI don't know it was fucking stupid ",

This would have been good if it was a short film but it took so long to get to the big reveal that everyone saw coming a mile away. My suggestion, watch the first thirty minutes to get a feel of the characters, then skip to the last twenty three minutes and twelve seconds. Makes for a much more satisfying film. ",

The director is clearly signaling something like that is going to happen throughout the entire film, it's intentional. The fun is in making you guess what is actually going to happen and how it is going to happen. I definitely think it was a well executed film if a little bit melodramatic.",

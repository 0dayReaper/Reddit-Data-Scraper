Out of all the other 1000+(?) anime I've watched in my quest to become the filthiest weeb of all time, I'd say the dubs were equal or slightly lesser. I also have a bias towards the original voices when it comes to any TV/film project, I don't like the idea of a separate studio editing the script to localize it, the exception being the always hilarious [Ghost Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys8Onvl1uxA), which flopped so hard in Japan they allowed the English VA's to mess with the script however they wanted to create a comedy masterpiece.

As awful as dubs are, the story managed to keep us intrigued until episode 3 where we realized we could switch it to subtitles. Dubs suck...I guess they're for people who can't read subtitles fast enough? Or so blind people can enjoy a foreign movie? But it absolutely destroys the nuances of the movie/show by changing the voices and the script.\n\nDefinitely watch this with subtitles if you don't know Portuguese. You're missing out on so much with the voice actors fucking it up.",

God knows how much country of birth effects your life outcome if we open it up to people born with disabilities or with health problems. \n\nThere's evidence that shows poverty has a direct effect on your fetal development and we also know that socioeconomic status is a huge factor in development during formative years as well. \n\nSo even saying things like intelligence plays a factor in success becomes fraught with implications when we accept that intelligence isn't an inherent trait we are born with but something that can be nurtured or stifled according to what environment we grow up in.\n\nYou can only really argue that tests are used as the determining factor of success in capitalism if that test is what ultimately is used to determine whether a persons succeeds or fails. Does a person born in a nation with high infant mortality and dies a few weeks later really have the same chance at success as someone who lives to adulthood because they were born in a more developed nation? Does a person who had to quit school at 8 to help feed their family really have the same ability to succeed as someone who was able to focus on their studies and graduate college debt free?\n\nWhat test can it be argued that capitalism utilizes to determine success?",

For example, The Giver (trying to make everyone truly equal would take everything that makes life worth living), Divergent (You shouldn't strive to *just* be smart, truthful, or nice. Being a whole person means being a little bit of everything), the Hunger Games (several ideas: resources should be spread more evenly so there's not such a large gap between the rich and poor, especially when the poor cannot hope to work hard enough to ever be rich. War doesn't ever really solve anything in the long run, etc)\n\n\n\nSo it's easy to say, all of these books look the same if you've just seen the movies. Yes, on the surface even this show sounds very similar, but it's *why* this fictional society runs this way that's often different.   ",

Happiness is fleeting, a constant wave you have stimulate with never ending splashes. Love will never be the same like it was in the beginning, there is a wall of reality everyone approaches that you have to overcome that requires more than coasting on happiness. Some people don't want to work at getting over this wall, give up and leave. But because you aren't as happy are you were in the beginning doesn't mean the love is gone, you have to keep paddling to keep the waves going. Next question.",

I detested the Hunger Games (The book is far superior) and Divergent but I kept an open mind going into the show and it was quite pleasant. The ideological theme's of this show can be a little bit heavy handed, there are definitely scene's in the show that are handled poorly or become illogical for the sake of adding drama and a few of the characters have absolutely ridiculous and moronic moral and philosophical positions that would come down like a house of cards with the smallest bit of scrutiny. \n\nHowever, the acting was great, the show did a great job of slowly filtering in new information to the plot organically to build intrigue and the story for the most part was nuanced and paced well so that most scenes were actually vital to the plot. \n\nOverall, definitely worth a watch, solid 7/10\n\nDon't watch with the dub, utterly horrendous.",

    "postText": "Give me anything, I'll try it! What do you like? I love Stranger Things, Shadow and Bone (even though it hurt a little but because they didn't stick to the book AT ALL), Heartstopper, Scrubs, Sweet Tooth, Star Trek and all its spin-offs, and a lot of the MCU tv shows. Open to all genres but I like sci-fi and action. Shows I started but couldn't finish include The 100, Never Have I Ever, and Gilmore Girls. No preference of rating, violence/gore, etc (maybe not full on horror, but again, I'll try anything). Prefer it to be on Netflix. Movies welcome as well. TIA.",

The sets and costumes are breathtaking. The musical scores are rich and warm and memorable and the writing and story is more than words can say.\n\nAlso episode 6 is easily in the top 3 most technically impressive things I've ever seen. The practiced that for what I recall was 8 months with a dummy crew and then the entire cast did it on their first take. I love all of Flanagan's work but Hill House is one of the few things I'd ever call perfect.",

            "comment": "Stateless - based on the real-life story of an Australian woman who winds up in an immigration detention center after escaping a cult; it also follows other characters whose lives intertwine\n\nGodless - in the American West of the 1880s, a murderous outlaw and his followers are hunting down his ex-protege. This chase leads them to the town of La Belle, inhabited only by women after a tragic mining incident\n\nGiri / Haji - a British-Japanese production in which a detective from Tokyo goes to London to look for his missing younger brother who has been involved with the Yakuza and accused of murder\n\nBaby - while not exactly a limited series, as it does have 3 seasons, it only has 18 episodes and it is completely finished. Loosely based on the real-life story of two Italian teenagers who become prostitutes despite coming from wealth.\n\nBehind Her Eyes - a series that follows a woman who works at a psychiatrist's office and begins an affair with the psychiatrist and strikes an unlikely friendship with his wife. It's not what it seems, so I highly recommend\n\nKaleidoscope - Giancarlo Esposito plays Roy, who masterminds the biggest heist ever attempted and he does it purely out of the desire to get revenge, but it's a heist rife with betrayal and nothing goes as planned\n\nUnbelievable - a young woman reports an incident of sexual assault, but the policemen do not take her seriously and the investigation is botched. That is, until two women detectives take over the case to find the one who did it\n\nManiac - I also want to recommend this one, in the event you haven't already watched it (though it's likely that you already did as I remember it was a pretty big deal when it came out as it stars Emma Stone and Jonah Hill)\n\nEdit: thank you for the award, kind stranger! It's the first one I've ever gotten :D",

The try-hard acting and scenario about the feelings and histories of the characters are very unrealistic and not related to the story at all. What is with the ugly creature that follows Amy Lau just because his father cheated on her mother? How realistic is it that they don't die in the woods all that time without any food or water and poisoned and that her husband happens to be the just there? I can't recall any unpredictable plot twists other than his brother not turning up dead after being shot twice by the police while escaping active shooting scene. It is an overrated show and I believe Netflix had to put in lots of effort to increase popularity and create a hype.",

At least that\u2019s how I viewed it. \nAs for their survival I think they were only out there 2 nights and that\u2019s definitely survivable. As for the reality of it all I thought it was meant to be relatively over the top. I don\u2019t want to give away a bunch of spoilers but everytime I thought they were going to move the plot in an obvious direction they surprised me. Honestly I didn\u2019t think Netflix hyped it enough. The PR campaign was fairly sparse. From my experience it gained a lot of momentum on early word of mouth.\nI respect your opinion though. It\u2019s nice to talk to someone who actually completely watched the show they claim to dislike and can present their point of view intelligently. Doesn\u2019t happen often on Reddit lol",

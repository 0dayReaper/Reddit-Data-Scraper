They turned to her each time. She was uncomfortable and tried to stop laughing but couldn't. She felt like they left the movie on for her, but also resented her laughter. She thinks they suspected the movie mocked country/rural people. They are all from rural NY and she thinks the real love for Southern culture that is such a big part of the movie didn't resonate with them. So, the jokes seemed like digs at bumpkins.",

This movie is more like 'Lord of the Rings' (which also has many haters) in that is an adventure sort of tale... more about the journey than the central plot. It's composed of several subplots, so some people might find it to be meandering. I personally love the universe that the Coen brothers created here so I wouldnt mind one bit if the movie kept meandering for hours.",

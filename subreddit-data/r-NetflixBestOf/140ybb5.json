            "comment": "I feel like their thick-headedness was very realistic. It's representative of how helpless parents in the same situation may feel. These are people with their own lives, pasts and trauma. They think they're doing the right thing bc that's the way they were raised or they don't believe someone they raised would take their own life. They want to trust their son bc they don't understand the illness. They don't take a professionals advice bc they're trying to coddle their poor little baby.\n\nSomeone who is growing up in a society more understanding of mental health will be watching this through a different lens. But mom and dad in this movie are from a time or family experience that didn't have such a focus on asking for help from professionals or otherwise. Even dad's new, young wife can see things more clearly than dad bc she is from a different generation.\n\nEdit- I don't think the message was to give a good image of parents helping their child. It's not supposed to make you feel good in the end or even throughout.",

Consider Beverly Hills Cop, Rush Hour (1998), and The Heat (2013) for examples of this.  \n\nAnyway that\u2019s just my experience of it.",

Seriously, not a wasted moment, cut, line of dialogue -- everything is tightly scripted and connected.\n\nThat said, it's constricted somewhat to it's genre by design. *Shaun of the Dead* followed this to some degree, but the fact is that both are sendups of very specific genres, meaning that the main weight of its effort goes into presenting, subverting, or tweaking tropes and conventions of those genres.\n\n*The World's End*, meanwhile, is much looser in that sense. It somewhat follows the alien \"body snatcher\" stories, but that shares center-stage with its character dramas and cyclical storytelling conceit. Because of that, it's less constrained -- while I could tell roughly where *Hot Fuzz* was going to end up, *World's End* was a bit more of a mystery. That lack of specific genre focus meant that the end was never as certain, the twists were more interesting, and the destination was in question.\n\nI mean, I could have guessed pretty handily that Nick Angel was going to grow into his role in Sanford, helping the police take their job more seriously while simultaneously learning to be a bit more loose and friendly. That's not a knock against the film: the way it gets there is masterful and feels earned. But did you seriously consider the possibility at the beginning of *The World's End* that Gary King would continue to buy into his own myth by drunkenly confronting an alien super-intelligence and dragging the world back into a regressive state where his childish, larger-than-life persona and mannerisms fit in? (I mean, I didn't, anyway)\n\nThen again, I'm not OP, so that's just like, my opinion, man.",

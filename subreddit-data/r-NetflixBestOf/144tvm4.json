I guess that if you need a precise explanation on why it\u2019s happening to enjoy the story, you\u2019re going to be disappointed. \nPersonally I was past that fact very quickly and enjoyed the mystery, the butterfly effects and the sort of love triangle.",

I've just gotta say though, the wig and taped on beard the main character wears to distinguish his younger and older self is so distractingly bad. Sometimes it's hard to watch because he looks so stupid \ud83d\ude2d",

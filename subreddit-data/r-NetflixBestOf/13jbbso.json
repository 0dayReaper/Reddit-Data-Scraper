    "postText": "I've never really watched any of Shonda's TV shows except for some episodes of How To Get away with Murder and Grey's Anatomy in passing but it's quite clear that she has an audience and knows them very well. I must say I am impressed with how far she has come, not just as a writer/producer but also just showing how women or persons of color don't need to be typecast and can inhabit any role.\n\nI was watching an interview with her about Bridgerton and she spoke about the name of her production company \"Shondaland\" and how it was named after this imaginary place she went to as a kid to escape, create these elaborate stories and watch them play out. When I think about it, at that time there really was nowhere else for her to escape to because people of color at the time were relegated to TV roles as gangsters, maids, hookers, drug addicts, slaves or sidekicks so the only place where someone like her mattered was in that imaginary place.\n\nNow I look at Bridgerton, a fictional story where are all these interesting characters exist but more importantly it creates a world for some little girl at home to now escape to. well....the appropriate age because I gather the series is quite risqu\u00e9 lol\n\nI don't know that Bridgerton is something I will watch because the overly dramatic, romantic stuff just isn't my thing but I'm glad to know there are people like her behind the camera. Now we just need other genres/stories like science fiction to catch up.",

            "comment": "Correct. Also Bridgerton isn't overly dramatic or romantic. It's actually quite comforting for some reason. I think the reason people love it so much is bc of the witty jokes amd hilarity of the situations the characters are put in. Like an English Regency ensemble comedy.",

The one and only time I have ever been convinced to watch anything so heavily focused on relationships and drama was Gilmore Girls and it was because of the writing and wit. The two leads in this Queen Charlette show appear to have similar chemistry, at least in their interviews. I'll maybe give that one a go when I have some time.",

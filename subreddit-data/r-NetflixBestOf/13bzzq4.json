I think Batman standalone did a lot of things well where it was able to really focus each episode on a singular villain. It became a \"match\" in a way where Batman would have to outdo the villain(s). In this way, we're able to get development not only on Batman, but on the villains themselves. \n\nThere are quite a few things that started out as being exclusive to that show (one of the biggest standouts being Harley Quinn) that was so good it became canon to the Batman Mythos overall. You got a deeper perspective into his rogue's gallery that we never really got in the comics. In my opinion, it was a masterclass in writing that I feel very few shows in the scope of media entirely can match up to. \n\nOn the other hand, Justice League was superb at showing the excellence of not only doing the right thing, but that \"the right thing\" can come in different forms. Everyone in the show shares the spotlight (not including an episode where we might only focus on one or two characters at a time) so character development is more of a slow burn where changes accumulate over time. \n\nHaving such a diverse cast really helps break up the pace and shake the monotony. While many episodes can be summed up as \"baddie of the week\" like B:tAS can be, I feel like there were a lot more episodes or moments where we saw what heroes were like outside of saving the day. It really fleshed out who people were. In fact, this show is part of what cemented John Stewart as people's favorite GL over Hal Jordan. \n\nOverall, I would say Justice League was much more character driven most of the time than plot. It has some of the tightest writing that property has EVER gotten (it was also largely if not the same writing staff that did Batman: The Animated Series) and there are some episodes that to this day I go back and watch just because of how cool they are.",

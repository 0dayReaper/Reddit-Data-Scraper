It can be pretentious if you aren't aware of it's absurdity, especially at the beginning and end.\n\nThere's a couple great stories in there somewhere and it's always good for a rewatch.",

I was really struggling to keep my shit together. I'm not going to feel guilty for whatever you're trying to make me feel guilty for, because that shit is what caused me to act like a bitch in the first place in the past. I couldn't afford therapy, so I just hung out with my professor and we both texted each other in the morning to make sure we both did it. It helped. It's basically just mindfulness meditation. I think most of the time she was just trying to get me to do it, but she was there for me, and the yoga helped. And my username is based off of a smashing pumpkins song, but mayonaise is always taken.",

It's rough thinking about what could've been, but you'll never know really, so why worry about it? If it's about whether you should've stayed with your ex or something.... just remember you only think about the great things. Once you start factoring in all of the bs he or she came with, you're content with how life panned out. ",

Randomly stumbled across it while watching a stream of horror/sci fi movies in 2013 and it's been my favourite ever since, I love just about everything about it. A nice combination of a few genres that it nails - sci fi, romance, drama, fantasy. I'm not the biggest Jared Leto fan but he was fantastic, and so was everybody else. I know I may seem like a fanboy shill but it really is that great, and everything about it is so unique to it and it has great rewatchability - I haven't watched it in over a year but I reckon I'll give it a watch on Netflix in the near future. \n\nOne thing I must admit is that it's either a love-it or hate-it movie, can definitely see how it turns some people off and that's fair enough, movies are such a subjective art form and everybody is allowed to think what they want. Doesn't change the fact that I can't recommend this enough though! ",

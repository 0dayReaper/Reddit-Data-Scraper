I know it's hard to believe based on every other cartoon aimed at adults but it's not a show made for 14 year Olds stringing one fart joke to the next. The humor gets a little crude occasionally but most of the time it's actually very lucid and satirical. And goddamn does that show have the ability to invoke very intense emotions in me. The writing is just superb, and it's really hard not to just sit down and binge a whole season in one go. \n\nI'd say it's probably the only cartoon to make me cry and hysterically laugh in the same episode. From one random redditor to another, give it a shot. \n\nEdit: easy on the downvotes people. Just expressing my opinion. I understand now that it's not for everyone. ",

In the idiom, brass tacks means (1) the essentials, or (2) the basic facts, so to get down to brass tacks is to focus on the essentials. The phrase\u2019s exact derivation is unknown, though there are a few theories. One is that the expression is inspired by the centrality of actual brass tacks in furniture and upholstery. Another is that brass tacks is simply a bit of rhyming wordplay derived from facts. In any case, the phrase was widespread in its modern sense by the early 20th century.",

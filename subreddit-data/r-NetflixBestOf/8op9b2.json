Not explicitly, but if you watched it, it's pretty simple. *Spoilers for anyone who still hasn't seen IW* Hulk got the absolute shit kicked out of him by Thanos, he wasn't about to come out and take that heat again. \n\nCaps beard and outfit is also simple, if you watched Civil War. He's a fugitive. The government wants him in prison. \n\nNot sure what you mean by black widow having Derek Jeter problems but hopefully I cleared everything else up!",

I mean, certainly, that's not a -- I don't know that the Hulk is ever... he's had his ass kicked before, and he loves a good fight. But I think that it's really reflective of the journey from Ragnarok. Is that these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control. And I think that if the Hulk were to say why, it'd be [that] Banner only wants Hulk for fighting. I think he's had enough of saving Banner's ass.",

And this is before he puts on the yankee cap. But then again there's other sides. Let's say you have herpes. But Scarlett fucking Johanssen is chatting you up. Even when you try actively to scare her away, you know about those scabs down there, you know what can happen, its not even fun to think about sex anymore. But it's *Scarlett* *Johanssen...* and she wants your yankee cock. She keeps \"accidentally\" brushing it and talking about how much she hates her dad, who was a Mets fan. The whole time her phone is vibrating off the hook with unsolicited pictures of muscley billionaire Avengers who want to ruin their marriages for this woman. She's ghosting all of them for you. Do you tell her about the herpes???\n\n/s obviously i'm joking pls tell someone if you have herpes and you bout to get together. \n\nedit: addendum:: and let's say scarjo is the one with the herp and you're just average incel redditor (like me) do you reject her advances and remain pure or can you put uo with the coldsore? Btw i have no idea what herpes actually is so it could be coldsores, it could be scabs, it could be mandibles growing out of your face during the full moon. I'm not attractive to anyone so I would never know. ",

It has mystery, comedy and I think great characters.\n\nThe Society (2019) - I really liked this show and I can\u2019t believe they cancelled it after one season. The main theme was similar to the Lord of the Flies but I think there was much more to it.\n\nTeenage Bounty Hunters (2020) - quite underrated, I had no expectations going on and definitely did not expect it to be as good as it was.\n\nI Am Not Okay With This (2020) - based on a graphic novel, it\u2019s about a teenager navigating her life while she also gets a superpower she can\u2019t really control.\n\nThe Woman in the House Across the Street From the Girl in the Window (2022) - Kristen Bell. Do I need to say more?\n\nArchive 81 (2022) - The premise is quite interesting and it was enjoyable overall but once you start getting answers around the mystery, it drags a bit, could be good if you enjoy a slow burn.\n\nThe Midnight Club (2022) - The show centres around teenagers telling ghost stories parallel to their own relationships/lives.\n\nDash &amp; Lily (2020) - I literally rewatch this every time on Christmas.\n\nDaybreak (2019) - Deserved so much better but cancelled after season 1. It takes place in a post apocalyptic world but only teens have managed to survive.\n\nFakes (2022) - This is rarely talked about and I quite enjoyed it. It\u2019s the semi-true story of two teens who launch a fake IDs business.\n\nBoo, Bitch (2022) - It\u2019s about two senior BFFs who realise that they haven\u2019t really done much in high-school and in their last attempt to be seen, one of them becomes a ghost and helps the other.\n\nWednesday (2022) - I literally counted the days down for this show to be released. I love both Jenna Ortega and the original Addams Family movies.\n\nThese are just some suggestions, there are also a ton of other good shows on Netflix with only one season, such as Squid Game (2021), The Queen\u2019s Gambit (2020), October Faction (2020), Girlboss (2017), Russian Doll (2019), The Haunting of Hill House (2018), The Haunting of Bly Manor (2020) and of course, Beef (2023). It really depends on what you usually like to watch or want to explore.",

I found it to be incredibly funny and I cried laughing many times. The humor is very subtle though and very, very dry. At the same time, it might be seen as a decent but not incredible mystery show. I love it for both things that it accomplished and I've watched it beginning to end 3 times now. I'll probably watch it again.",

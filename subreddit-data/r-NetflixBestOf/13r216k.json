    "postText": "Looking for things to help pass the time on TV/movies. I'm getting oral surgery tomorrow and I'm supposed to be on couch rest for the whole weekend and in the USA. It's a long memorial day weekend. looking for stuff that can hold my attention with a good story. \n\nI have Netflix, Prime, hob max, Hulu, diesny+, peacock, paramount+ \n\nThe most recent titles I've watched is everything Star Wars on Disney+. I've watched all of the marvel stuff on Disney+. I like Witcher. I like House of the Dragon. I like Bridgerton. I like Virgin River. I liked Warrior nun.. I liked the Boys. I like Selena plus chef. \n\nI liked Yellowstone for the first four seasons, but it really wasn't that great. I think it's overhyped. But I would watch season five when it comes out on streaming. I really like the first couple seasons of Lucifer, but the last season just kind of like dragged on, so I never finished it. Not a huge fan of Crime sagas, I mean I watch them once in awhile if it is a movie but it's not like I'm obsessed with NCIS or CSI or something. \n\nnothing horror or scary.  I am a baby\n\nand no sad stories please. (nothing like my sisters keeper) \n\nRom coms are fine. \n\nI tried watching the great British bake off, but to be honest that show is so boring.  So I'm looking for something that's really good and I can hold my attention throughout the whole weekend. Or like a collection of franchises, I can watch throughout the weekend.",

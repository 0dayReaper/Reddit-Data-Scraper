    "postText": "The last kingdom: Seven Kings must die\n\nI just found the recent movie \u201cSeven Kings Must die\u201d and it was wonderful. I loved the show so this was a great surprise to me, thinking it was long over. I\u2019m actually really surprised this show was not as popular as Game of Thrones. I find it easier to follow and much more interesting. It still has the brutality and depth as GOT but more engaging and fun to watch without needing a flowchart and cheat-sheet. \nI hope they do more of these mini-movies.",

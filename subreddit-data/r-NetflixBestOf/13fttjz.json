    "postText": "The show won an Emmy, Golden Globe, god knows what else. But I genuinely can't see why, how, and for what. There was nothing interesting about the show. It wasn't even mediocre, it was bad, slow, and very boring. Irritating, even. Uninteresting, unrealistic characters, that do the same things each episode for 6 episodes. Not to mention the strange yellow tint choice.\n\nI never really sit through a whole show if the first 1-2 episodes aren't interesting enough. But the kind of hype this show got, and the fact that it was only 6 episodes, I was curious to find out what it was all about. I just simply don't get it. At all. \n\nSo, I'd love to hear why you liked it, from those of you that did. \n\n(I'm only talking about S1, haven't watched S2)",

What\u2019s gonna happen next?\u201d It\u2019s much more subtle and a character driven show. The entertainment is in the tension between all of the characters and also the satire behind it all. Season 1 you have the rich douchey mama\u2019s boy, young spoiled teenagers, one of them feeling oppressed by her rich white friends, powerful female ceo. Season 2 you have the private equity bro, the rich tech nerd, the young naive white guy, sex addict dad. Just a lot of stuff to unpack with these characters. It also sprinkled in some humor with drama. I can see why people might not love it but the characters are amazing to me. Also, it has incredible cinematography and music",

I did appreciate the deftness of how White skewered even initially sympathetic characters. I will always say that satire is the hardest style to pull off so I give the writers a lot of credit there. Plus it was shown during one of my countries many lockdowns so I'd get emotional when they did those long scenes of the screwed up son sleeping on the beach watching the sea. \n\nSeason 2 I found less engaging, I was talking about it with my sisters and we agreed that there was something cultural not translating for us (we are not American) but you know it was designed for US audiences so that's not really a problem, it just made me stop watching. I did appreciate how uncomfortable and unethical the scenarios with the local girls were. Sex tourism is gross.",

Other than one major plot point, I really could tell you in any detail what happened but the show is still a blast to watch for me.",

You have to understand it as a category of media that you don't appreciate, not that it's a lower quality product. \n\nThen there's the fact that it's satire about rich people, enough said because * gestures broadly at everything * our world isn't conducive to anyone understanding satire anymore.\n\nNow what's going to lose even more people is that it's subtle, and a lot of what happens is *unsaid*. You have to yourself fill in the blanks, just like in real life. There isn't going to be a scene where a character spells out for you what they're thinking and feeling. You have to do the work and go deep to understand what they're thinking and feeling, interpret the micro expressions on their face, the tone of voice they used, their choice of words. Did they waver, did they pause? This is where good acting comes in and can be fully appreciated. The actors can *shine* in this show. Like [that scene](https://www.slashfilm.com/1136451/lets-break-down-meghann-fahys-big-the-white-lotus-season-2-finale-scene/) with Meghann Fahy and Will Sharpe, which was totally brilliant *if you appreciate that kind of thing*",

Maybe also Beef, in terms of the connection between the two characters (it's a positive connection in Russian Doll), but I didn't make it past the first couple eps. Make sure you watch the first 2-3 episodes of Russian Doll to give it a fair chance - it gets more interesting/layered the more episodes you watch.\n\n[**Unorthodox**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nixgq1d5J7g) \\- bc you liked Maid",

Once I tried it again like a year later, and I stuck with it through 3 episodes I was enjoying it more, I was a lot more intrigued and excited to find out what happened next. There is a pivotal addition to the cast at the end of episode 3. It got better from there.",

Season 1 is fantastic, the other seasons are pretty good too.\n\nMy wife liked Jane the Virgin, it's kinda similar to Gilmore Girls, but takes lots of inspiration from telenovelas.\n\nEdit #2: Sorry, I keep seeing more things. The umbrella academy is fantastic. It's a dark comedic superhero show with some really likeable characters. \n\nAnd you could try The 100. I enjoyed the first few seasons, but then I lost interest. Still, it might give you 1-2 seasons to enjoy while you find something else to watch.",

We tried ozark. But for me it was pretty exhausting (cause it\u2019s so dark, depressing and pretty hard to follow)",

            "comment": "&gt;a little light and my boyfriend would love some drama.\n\nHmmm...I'm thinking comedy-dramas or something escapist like scifi or fantasy.\n\nSeconding:\n\n* [**The Good Place**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QxRbzFk3zk) \\- crowd pleaser; it's technically a sitcom, but I haven't seen any other sitcom with so much plot/intrigue driving the story.\n* [**Crazy Ex-Girlfriend**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp64COE3KXc) (more niche, but oh so good)\n\nI'd also recommend:\n\n[**iZombie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQhzQDW4L84) (scifi police procedural comedy drama) - there's violence and murder (it's a zombie police procedural) but overall the tone isn't too dark, it's more like a scifi dark comedy-drama. It's adapted from a comic book.\n\n[**Sex Education**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd2ldTR-WpI&amp;t=10s) (highschool/family feel-good raunchy dramedy)\n\n[**The Chair**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOqtBtWGl1Q) (academia satire dramedy)\n\n**Avatar the Last Airbender** (family fantasy epic - mostly lighthearted but with a strong emotional foundation) - I watched this for the first time as an adult and loved it.\n\n[**Merlin**](https://youtu.be/01rxgwVmxx0?t=4) \\- it's cheesy at times but has good bones and the two leads are great actors with delightful chemistry.\n\n[**Bojack Horseman**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1eJMig5Ik4) (comedy, Hollywood/societal satire, character study) - maybeee. It gets pretty damn heavy/dark, but it's not bleak and nihilistic in the way I imagine Ozark is. Technically a comedy, but boy is there a lot of drama too.\n\nDark fantasy/scifi that is escapist:\n\n* [**Stranger Things**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnd7sFt5c3A) \\- prettty damn dark, but also the scifi world-building is escapist and the jokes keep things fun.\n* [**Sweet Tooth**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zG9RuJb3QU) \\- not as dark or violent as Stranger Things\n* [**Umbrella Academy**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DAmWHxeoKw)",

Lots of manipulation and the entire show is a metaphorical game of chess. Really well thought out.\n\nCode Geass (not on Netflix in US) is very much like Death Note but more Sci fi. I personally like Code Geass over Death Note, but it has some silly parts a few times. \n\nBut Attack On Titan gets my vote for most serious for you to watch.  ",

However, due to his overwhelming strength, Saitama has become bored with his powers and is constantly trying to find stronger opponents who can fight him.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n&gt; Once released in the United States, both the first and second volumes debuted on the New York Times Manga Best Sellers list, at first and second place, respectively, and stayed there for two weeks. Volume one dropped to second place for the third week, while volume two fell off the list altogether. Volume one was still on the list for a fourth week. The series was nominated for an Eisner Award in 2015\\.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?%22One+Punch+Man%3A+Wanpanman%22+%282015%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=One-Punch%20Man), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5102879).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F60h046 \"Confidence: 0.94\").

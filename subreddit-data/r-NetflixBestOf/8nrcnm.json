And not like, *Yeah this song is such a good song!* But the music for each scene like you mention adds to the scene in such a profound manner. Gimme Shelter when the black guy says, \"It puts hate in your heart,\" really resonates. The song plays at the perfect point as he says it, and you feel massive sympathy and immersion at the moment. \n\nThe obvious example of this is I'm Shipping Up To Boston. Holy shit. When that hits you get chill bumps, and it hits at the perfect part when you see him in the cell, and he starts exercising, like *I'm committed to this shit, let's do this. I wanted to become a cop, and this is how I have to do it. Let's fucking go!* \n\nVan Morrison's version of Comfortably Numb is great too. He lets himself go and give in to what he knows he should not, love, rather than focus on his job. I don't care about the words of the song, I'm sure they're on point, but when the chorus hits as they're rolling on the bed, again it's just such a wonderful crescendo of visual and audible going off at once, and just for a fleeting moment. \n\nMusic and sound are top notch in this film.",

That would be more notable if it were a great film, but it isn\u2019t. \n\nNow, in my mind, even if The Departed didn\u2019t have as many f-bombs, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg absolutely perfected the use of the word via their respective roles. They should have gotten some kind of award for their achievement. I don\u2019t think anyone will ever be able to top their artful execution of timeless lines such as \u201cfuck yourself\u201d and \u201cwell la-di-fuckin\u2019-da\u201d.",

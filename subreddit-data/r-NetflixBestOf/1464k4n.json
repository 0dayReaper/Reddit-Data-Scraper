    "postText": "Going to be stuck in hospital for 3-4 days next week and looking for something bingeable to pass the time. Ideally something you get very engrossed in.\n\nIssue is, I spent almost a year in and out of hospital in 2021/2022 and basically demolished any watchlist I had, and now am struggling massively to find something I'd be interested in, any suggestions welcome - note good chance I have potentially seen it \n\nExamples of stuff I like;\n- The wire\n- Breaking bad/better call saul\n- Sopranos / boardwalk empire / peaky blinders\n- The expanse\n- Succession\n- Severance \n- The last Kingdom / Vikings / rome\n- mad men (though not sure I am in the mood for something of this tone / pace)\n- band of brothers\n- hannibal \n- black mirror\n\n\nThanks!",

Earth was made uninhabitable by nuclear war; 150ish years later a small colony of humans are surviving on a cobbled together space station but they are running out of oxygen and will have to cull part of the population. They decide to send a group of (teen) convicts to Earth to see if it is survivable. It's a CW show and has it's flaws but it's also a great story with some really well done fight scenes.",

Ideally I want to avoid anything too too heavy. \n\nThey often like things like Murdoch\u2019s Mysteries, Ms. Fisher\u2019s, and Bluebloods. But anything wholesome will do.\n\nI just can\u2019t sit through another comedy with them that looks wholesome and family-friendly but by the middle the protagonist is screaming about having cAsUaL SEX.

The examples you listed were all tv shows....?\n\nMOVIES\n\n**Chicken Run** (somewhat dark comedy/heist/political allegory) - it's actually a very progressive, low-key radical movie with some communist messaging, but it's all wrapped up in a funny cartoon (in the style of Wallace and Gromit) about chickens escaping a chicken farm. Depending on what flavor of \"conservative\" your grandparents are (on one side, mine were fairly liberal but religious and buttoned up), they might not care or might not pick up on the obvious allegory of the film...conservatives tend to hold a lot of cognitive dissonance.\n\n**Julie &amp; Julia** (slice of life/romcom) - sex is occasionally mentioned and one of the couples clearly are about to have sex (but nothing is ever seen aside from brief kissing) but it's all far less sexy/erotic than anything on Miss Fisher.\n\n**Enola Holmes** (mystery/investigation/YA) - bc your grandparents like mysteries...it's cute and wholesome, but may be a bit too cutesy/teen for their tastes. Also there is a specific flavor of kind of superficial feminist pandering in this script that I feel like particularly irritates conservatives, the type of thing where they shake their fists at the clouds and scream \"hOLLyWooD iS tOo WOKE.\" I don't think there is any sexuality in this film (just a peck at the end), as it's meant to be appropriate for older kids...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I just can\u2019t sit through another comedy with them that looks wholesome and family-friendly but by the middle the protagonist is screaming about having cAsUaL SEX. O\\_O\n\nLollll I will just point out that Miss Fisher's romantic/sexual relationships are almost exclusively casual sex. She is having casual sex all the time, although we don't see the actual sex and the show doesn't use much course language iirc. Her casual sexual relationships are one of the many ways Miss Fisher scandalizes society with her modern values and assertiveness, constantly pushing against the gender norms/constraints of the time (it helps that she's stupid rich). There's also a LOT of unresolved sexual tension between Miss Fisher and Detective Robinson, like more than I have seen in most shows (but it remains \"unresolved\")",

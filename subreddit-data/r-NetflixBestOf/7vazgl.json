Just spend a million or two for an ad on one of the most-watched events in the world, launch right after said event, and then, like you said, reap the benefits of positive buzz around the office on Monday.",

It had its cool parts, and like you said, there was an Event Horizon feel to it, but the bridge between the second and third acts kinda dragged on, not to mention how terrible that movie was about technobabble. Like, they claim that the disaster happened because of something we've managed to do in real life already.",

Note that this satellite is totally different from the Cloverfield Station in the new movie. Whether the events from The Cloverfield Paradox caused the satellite to fall (via some time-dimension explosion ripples), or them being totally unrelated events is still being theorized about. We don't know where Clover comes from though, just that she was woken up from underneath the water after hibernating for hundreds of years. It's heavily implied in the new movie that she's from a different dimension, maybe an earth where those monsters evolved instead of humans. The particle accelerator fucked up time/space and displaced a bunch of these monsters across different earths. It's also important to note is that the monster in the new movie is *way* bigger than the one in the first movie, along with technology being clearly at the 2018+ level compared to the 2008 tech in the original, so the new movie is probably in an entirely different dimension than the first one. Regardless, the events of The Cloverfield Paradox still cause the events original movie to happen, again via the space/time fuckiness thanks to the particle accelerator overloading.  \n\\*(EDIT: SEE REPLY BELOW, IT'S POSSIBLE WE STILL DON'T WHAT THE FALLING OBJECT IS, thanks /u/adamthinks)] (/spoiler)",

One random girl showed up in the wall, the worms showed up, and then the guys arm is arbitrarily ripped off. After that there is no more altered reality happenings, it just stops, which made it feel very forced instead of a true element of the story. \n\nAlso, Molly(?) The girl that the girls husband finds, has little to no addition to the plot either other than as a mechanism to give the husband more screen time?\n\nAnyways, I went and watched 10 Cloverfield Lane. Much better movie. ",

But was their anything in the first Cloverfield to indicate that there was some sort of energy crisis? Everything was normal until the monsters showed up. I know the author in the beginning said that it could affect time so my second though was that the experiment caused the monsters to show up in the past (pre-energy crisis) but that wouldn\u2019t make sense because then the monsters would have been on Earth before the ship went up.\n\nAnyone have an interpretation?",

(I realize the big game gets lots of eyes but even the spot was short and early on.) That\u2019s pretty incredible. \n",

I thought it was going to go full Alien for a second until he spewed eels everywhere.  Then the gyroscope was inside him for some reason!?  And the disembodied but still living arm told them??  How??  Why??\n\nI liked this movie.  It had a sweet cast and it was visually pretty amazing.  But damn..best thing I can say about it is that I can't wait for the Rifftrax.",

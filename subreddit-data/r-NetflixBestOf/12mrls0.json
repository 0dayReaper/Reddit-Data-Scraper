The stuff I really did like were Lost in Space, House of Cards, Stranger Things, Ozark, Arcane, Black Mirror, Sweet Tooth, Lock &amp; Key, Squid Game, OA and Love Death &amp; Robots. \n\nI occasionally try out stuff like Night Agent, Invisible City, Bastard Son of The Devil, Wednesday, You, Witcher Origins, Dirty John, Alice in Borderland, but they\u2019re just not holding my attention.\n\nI don\u2019t know if that helps. Since many of the likes and dislikes are similar on paper. \n\nUsually Netflix was good with recommendations. Or something like Tiger King explodes outta nowhere through word of mouth. But it\u2019s been months and months of nothing. It feels like I may have watched everything.",

So not only is it recommending stuff I don't care about, it's withholding stuff I might!   Worse, if I try a show and I fall asleep, I must not have liked it very much.  But the algorithm thinks I binged it thanks to auto-play and it's my new favorite thing.  \n\nThat said, I do fall asleep watching things I do like, so I wish they had a \"Falling asleep\" button.  It means keep playing, mark this spot, and don't play another one.  So I don't get all the spoilers trying to find which episode I was on and then rewind it.",

Unfortunately there is no way to filter these out along with all the terrible grade D movies they have added that are so bad it\u2019s a waste of time. I have enjoyed many of the movies Netflix has produced but they are few and far between.  Netflix is known for their huge library of films, most of which are not worth watching. They seem to gobble up all the movies the other streaming services have deemed a waste just to say they have more. Netflix has become the waste bin for all the cinematic crap ever produced. I have been spending more time with the other services.  I will eventually dump Netflix.  Sad day.",

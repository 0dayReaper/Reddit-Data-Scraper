Jokes span between episodes even more heavily here than they did in the past 3 seasons. I often read people saying that they made it 1 or 2 episodes in before bailing because it wasn't funny. The problem is that they saw episodes with setups to punchlines that happen much later, and punchlines to setups that won't happen for a couple of hours.\n\nNo, that's not the best sell for a show, saying you have to watch an hour or two for it to get enjoyable. It just makes me sad when I see people bailing out before the jokes start properly hitting. Season 4 isn't the same as the first 3 seasons and I do love it for that",

If that\u2019s true it\u2019s an impressive way to work around a major logistics problem. ",

As with other seasons, it benefits from multiple rewatches, but it doesn't do so well on the first run. The reason being that you pick up stuff going on in the earlier episodes that are referenced or explained later in the season.",

There are jokes you can't get in early eps without seeing later eps. Plus it just felt so different and things seemed off, once you've seen it they stop standing out as much.\n\nThe later eps are definitely the best ones\n\nIts the first tv season length movie, it really is an entirely new creation",

I think it's great how in later episodes you get a different persons perspective of something that happened in earlier episodes and a fair amount of jokes and plotlines pay off in a cool domino effect.\n\n",

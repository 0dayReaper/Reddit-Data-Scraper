            "comment": "[**Everything Is Gonna Be Okay**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyt_e50eoeI) (Hulu) - I have heard good things about the representation in *Everything Is Gonna Be Okay*, where the actor who plays someone with autism is autistic herself (she is high functioning). Also the writer/creator/star is autistic irl (but not in the show?). I actually prefer the previous series he created/starred in, [*Please Like Me*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38blU2FAjts) (Hulu). Although both shows are somewhat inspired by his own life/personality, I don't think either of his characters are meant to be autistic - or at least they are high functioning and pass as neurotypical or are undiagnosed autistic.\n\n[**Atypical**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieHh4U-QYwU) (Netflix) I have heard some positive reviews of the representation of autism in *Atypical*, but I think maybe also some mixed reviews? Overall I think better than The Good Doctor, but it wasn't a show I ended up sticking with myself so idk. I think the actor is neurotypical.\n\n[**Extraordinary Attorney Woo**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxeXECe2t-c) (Netflix) - I haven't seen the show, but have heard very positive reviews in general. I haven't really seen reviews discussing the show's representation of autism specifically, so I can't really speak to that. I believe the actor who plays the titular role is neurotypical. [Here is one positive review from a real life autistic lawyer.](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/journal/articles/2022/lawyer-with-autism-explores-netflix-series-extraordinary-attorney-woo/)\n\nBtw, I don't think autism is generally referred to as a \"mental disorder\" (which typically refers to things like major depression, OCD, schizophrenia), but a developmental or processing disorder (which refers to things like autism and ADHD). And then there are also intellectual disabilities, which are something else. I am by no means well-read on the topic though, so don't take my word for it.",

            "comment": "I watched the Magicians for the first time in a place where I was mentally healthy, was generally in a good place. It was a fun show. I enjoyed it.\n\nAfter living in an abuse situation, being diagnosed with an illness, and watching my mental health decline, I went back to rewatch it. I now see all the tiny, anti-abuse and mental health moments that were woven into the show. \n\nThe show can be childish at times, but then you see someone plainly say:\n\nPERSON 1: \"Yeah, x threatened to kill themself if they didn't get back together\"\n\nPERSON 2: \"Wow, that's CRAZY and innapropriate!\"\n\nIn a good place now, but man-- the way they just called it out and put it to bed like that was incredible. Tons of little moments like that where they just straight up say abuse is abuse and the watcher has to deal. The show gave me a voice and it will forever have a tear-filled place in my heart. Guys don't have a lot of resources and half the time if you say a woman is abusing you, everyone assumes you're bad, deserve it, or lying. Also doesn't help when the first thing she does when she doesn't like something is call anyone who will listen and lie about the most important details of whatever you discussed to turn EVERYONE against you. Ahem. I digress. \n\nThe stuff I saw one of the characters go through in the first season felt like a carbon copy of the desensitization and hopelessness that I felt. To paraphrase a quote, \"x was so tired and hurt that they just didn't care if it all broke down anymore.\" 100% gave me someone to commiserate with when my friendships had been cut off. Depression, self harm, etc. Best way I've seen mental health issues explained. At least to me. It was also good to see that I wasn't broken or weak; I was abused and my response was natural, if sad. Importantly though, it helped me see that it wasn't my fault, it was my abuser's.\n\nPlus he was my type and I might be a little bi now. Therapist will have a field day with that one. I can pretty easily point at half a dozen women who have done nothing but brutalize me. In contrast, I can point at a few different times where my brothers utterly saved me. \n\nAnyhow, Magicians is great and I owe whoever added those little moments an endless pint. It's also showed me how powerful having a voice is, so I want to advocate for abuse victims in the future. I'm 6'5\" 220 with a meteoric career and a great upbringing. If it can happen to me, it can happen to someone else.",

I like it because there didn't seem to be a forced narrative. It was about people looking for love in the ways anyone looks for love, just with the extra help they may need. What I didn't expect was how diverse it was. There were lots of different starting points. Some people had a relatively easy time dating and found other people on or off the spectrum that they vibed with. For others, it was an incredible challenge, and I wasn't entirely confident at the end they would find anyone at all -- and a few didn't.",

            "comment": "I think maid , with Andie McDowell ( who plays Paula, Alex's Mother) and her real life daughter Margaret Qualley  plays her daughter in the show (Alex, the main character). Andie, did an amazing job showing how and what Bipolar is. Paula who is Alex's mom in the show is Manic depressive aka bipolar and she does an amazing job showing how that effects her and her decisions she makes as a person, mother and grandmother and also the effects it has on her only child, Alex. Alex is a domestic worker (a maid), a young, newly single mother who is trying to escape a mentally abusive boyfriend/father of her child and struggling with homelessness and wrestling with the \"help\" the government provides and shows how broken the system is all the while she's basically her mother's caretaker in a way even though her mom is all SHE has to run to but Paula is, again, bipolar and highly unpredictable. \n\nIt's an amazing show that I recommend EVERYONE watch. It's a limited series ( molly, the shows creater and writer just signed a multi year contract with Netflix writing and creating shows. So I truly hope she will decide to make another season since the first did so well and at one point was Netflix's most liked/watched show, ever at the same time as squid games) it's 10 ep but I think people of all walks of life can relate to it some how, some way. It also opens the eyes of those who have never been a \"Alex\" to really appreciate those domestic workers that work so hard and struggle to live to make sure everyone else can go on living. Wether that be getting their breakfast on their way to work from that McDonald's worker, staying in a clean hotel room on a work trip that the house keeper just made up prior to checking in, that daycare worker who's watching their children so they can make a living and good life for their family to live. Also, the mental illnesses they (domestic workers and or their family also struggle with or that they have to go home too. \n\nIt's a true story from a book called \"Maid - hard work, low pay. A mother's will to survive\" by Stephanie land. I HIGHLY recommend reading. It's so similar to the show which I love but also has sooooo much more of her story regarding the mental illnesses and other battles I mentioned above.",

I bet the most exposure people get of mental disorders is from mediums such as movies, TV shows, etc. That is why something like The Good Doctor is problematic. Poor representation of mental disorders could potentially perpetuate misinformation and stereotypes to its audience, leading them to have a negative and inaccurate view of mental disorders and the people who have them. It is insulting and degrading to people who actually suffer from these disorders.\n\nBut I mean like, even if we were to take out the problematic aspects of The Good Doctor, the show still looks like shit lmao. Every single clip I have seen of this show on Twitter (from the \u201cI AM A SURGEON\u201d scene, to the scene where the MC breaks down in the middle of a surgery and fucking leaves, to the scene where the MC was being kind of a transphobe) just tells me that this show is just not good.",

But the show is confirmed now for a season 7 or 8 ( I lost track of it tbh) but I am not surprised since ABC also owns greys anatomy so\u2026.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame because Freddie ( The actor who portrays Shawn ) was really good in bates motel .

'Coraline' where the idea is escape and how reality is a more fulfilling existence than fantasy). I couldn't help but feel Kubo was just an adventure story, nothing wrong with that, it was just different than what I've come to expect from Laika. I don't doubt that the work to produce something like Kubo is debilitating, and it hurts to hate on it, but the story should come first in every production.",

Kubo is an incredible achievement in coming of age story telling in my opinion. I loved seeing Kubo have to sift through which lessons he learned as a child where important and which were not. Seeing previous generations logic, passion and viciousness crumble because Kubo and his mother discovered true love is something special. Coraline learned to temper expectations from life and family and be appreciative but Kubo and we learned so much more about how to really live. It's probably easier for most of us to relate to Coraline but I some people get much much more from Kubo.",

It's cohesive, which means that it's easy to follow along. Now I'm not saying I didn't understand what was happening in kubo (cuz I did and full disclosure I did enjoy Kubo)\n\nThe pacing in kubo is just so weird. It reallt felt like all the scenes are rushed in order to get to the next big 'fight'. Some character development seems super forced (the grandfather at the end). I think this has to do with condensing a book down into a movie which is a hell of a challenge.",

Judy Hops is not trying to be a champion weightlifter, she is trying to be a cop, which is apparently not out of the realm of impossibility, but was frowned upon only because no rabbit had done it before.\n\n**It is funny.**  It has comedic coincidences that are hilarious and unrealistic (Judy saving Mr. Bigs' daughter) only the day before.  Running into a fox (who turns out to be the only fox who \"knows everyone in Zootopia\").  I mean, come on, who doesn't think that a weasel using small cars as skates is not funny!?\n\n**It has a happy ending.**  Because honestly, it is made for kids (well, at least partly) and who wants their kid crying at the end of the movie because Judy is killed when a rhinoceros tramples her when she tries to arrest him for aggravated assault at a bar in Tundra Town at 2 in the morning?\n\n**The bad guys lose and the good guys win.**  Because that is how things are supposed to go, so there is your \"moral of the story\" part of the movie.  Just about every kid has been picked on at some point in their life, I know I was.  They like to see that the small person who is picked on gets what she wants and the ones who picked on her feel bad for their actions (Gideon Grey).\n\nAnyway, I have to go to the hardware store now and get to work replacing my front door knob my kids somehow broke and I had to cut the latch apart to get my front door open this morning.  Yay.\n\nOh, I almost forgot to put this;  I like it because of all these things, and I really am a big kid who has to act like an adult a lot, and with good cartoons (like this one - in my opinion) I can turn off the \"Adult\" switch and enjoy it.",

The bunny and the fox both have preconceived notions of each other that are proven both right and wrong.  The predator and prey relationship shows that there are other ways to be abusive besides physically (as shown by the sheep manipulation everyone).  I loved Zootopia because of the characterization.  Everyone was flawed in such an honest way and interacted in just a slightly over the top way to call attention to the biases and insecurities we have as a society.\n\nAlso the animation was unbelievable (as was Kubo's).\n\nI think Kubo lacked mostly in the characterization which led to the story seeming weak.  There was never really a point where the audience is unsure of what a character was going to do.  They had their set morals and acted accordingly.  Zootopia had the characters seriously examining their morals and coming to the realization that what they were taught isn't what they believe.  ",

I'll try to be vague.\n\nMain issues: \n\n1a) They have multiple characters keeping secrets with no actual motivation to do so, just so the plot can have twist reveals later on in the movie.\n\n1b) Unfortunately, the twists are obvious enough that they don't even really count as twists. They're just frustrating, because the characters figure them out long after the audience has. This makes the characters seem oblivious.\n\n2) Character motivations in general are very vague. The villains want to do something villainous. Why? Because they're villains. And yet their own motivations contradict themselves. The main villain could have been motivated by a desire for power, reuiniting his family, etc. But he sacrifices both his power and his family wantonly without seeming to care much for what he is losing. He just continues on, not personally getting involved until the very end, when all of his other resources have been spent.\n\n3) Memory loss is used as a plot device multiple times to make sure characters don't make a better informed choice that would blow up the threadbare plot.\n\n4) All of the problems above could be forgiven if the story felt real, but it doesn't. It's completely by the numbers. It isn't a fairy tale, or a legend, or a folk story. It's a by-the-numbers plotline with a resolution better suited for a Saturday morning cartoon.\n\nI really loved the movie in spite of the above criticisms. My advice is: Don't try to guess ahead, don't think about what characters could or should have done. Don't second guess the mythology they try to build up. Just accept the story as is and enjoy it as art. ",

Kubo and the Two Strings does something similar where love and family is a big deal and they make it super obvious.\n\nThere are also some story elements that I feel weren't used properly through the movie, but all those criticisms are minor.\n___\n\nKubo and the Two Strings is a beautiful movie and leaves you very satisfied.",

I had zero emotional connection to the story or characters and, was really bothered by how unnecessarily  whitewashed the cast and plot was turning out to be ... but in all fairness, as I mentioned before, I didn't even bother to finish watching it. Maybe I would have liked the second half. I just don't care enough about it to find out. \n\nEdit - I love how I actually explain my position and contribute to the continuation of a discussion, and I'm downvoted into oblivion, yet \"I HATE IT\" is still visible. \n\nFucking Reddit. \n\n\nTL;DR- racist white washed bullshit story that is only saved by being beautiful.

I only read the book after I saw it, but it was a pretty faithful adaptation, even though they changed a few things. I think Kubo is an extremely close second when I rank my favourites; you can really see how much their animation and storytelling (for their original work) have improved and the behind-the-scenes videos and photos of how they constructed the characters and the incredible scale of some of the set pieces shows how much dedication and skill goes into creating their films. I just hope they continue to do well because I adore stop motion animation and it must be really difficult for a studio like theirs to stay competitive with computer animation studios that can put out more films more quickly.",

But universal might not want to keep partnering with them to release the films widely I guess. \n\nAlso I don't agree that Kubo should of won an oscar for best animated movie. As much as I enjoyed watching Kubo outside of it's technical achievement in stop motion everything about the story feels rushed. When he and his companions go on their quest to get the items they need to defeat the villains it's nearly liker watching a speedrunner play a zelda game using glitches to get to the next location. \n\nZootopia was just better paced, well written, had a equally talented voice cast and was on par in the technicality of the animation just CG and not stop motion. Plus it was an unexpected major hit that helped led Disney to like 6 billion dollars domestically or something like that. \n\n",

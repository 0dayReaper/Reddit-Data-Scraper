I really enjoy seeing a comedic actor do so well in a non comedic role. \n\nMaybe its just me, but these are two that can make me cry every time. \n\n\"The Way We Were\". Not sure about this, but its a classic I love.",

            "comment": "I see a lot of recommendations for movies with sad parts that become happy but also end sadly/bittersweetly - The Notebook, Atonement. If that's the standard we are going by, I'd highly recommend:\n\n[**Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07-QBnEkgXU) \\- it ends on a happy note I think, but it's bittersweet. Also it's iconic.\n\n[**Normal People**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZw7wMQyTvI) (Hulu) - it's a tv series but as we are on a tv/movie sub, I'm recommending it anyway. Normal People is very melancholy (often sad) and atmospheric, like you feel the character's emotions in your bones. It ends on a happy but also bittersweet note. It's a much better love story than The Notebook and a happier story (while still containing a lot of melancholy and sadness at some points) than Atonement. Although I would recommend Atonement. Oh and also Normal People is super horny - small warning that there is a *lot* of sex.\n\n[**Brooklyn**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15syDwC000k) isn't strictly a romance, but the romance is a big part of the plot, and there is tragedy in the middle. I wouldn't necessarily describe it as a \"sad romance\" but there is romance, and there is sadness, and it ends very happily. Overall it's a feel good movie, so it might not be sad enough.\n\nOn my watchlist:\n\n[**In The Heights**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0CL-ZSuCrQ) isn't strictly romance, but there is a lot of romance and sadness.\n\n[**Her**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJTU48_yghs)\n\n[**Past Lives**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA244xewjcI) \\- I actually don't know how it ends, bc it's not out in theaters yet so not a lot of ppl have seen it.",

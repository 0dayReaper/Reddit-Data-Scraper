Any time i see him star in a movie or tv show that I think has an interesting plot but he's the \"main star\" in it, I get a little sad inside. But I always think, hey maybe he'll surprise me here. Then, he doesn't. I've watched a lot of movies he's been in from the beginning of his career to now, he hasn't gotten any better. He seems like a really wholesome dude but i don't think he was ever meant to be a main character.",

The real stinker was the script writing and there were very clear budget concerns that shrunk the world it was set in. S1 you saw different worlds, cultures, locales, groups, ideologies, etc. that the universe it was set in was very fleshed out and believable. S2 felt like a typical SyFy Channel series where the only ones with any agency are the have a dozen paid actors' characters. The problem you end up with is the same you get with the Star Wars sequels: everything revolves around those half dozen characters and you never feel like their eventual triumph is ever in doubt. In S1 every move Kovacs makes brings him into contact with another person or group or legal/technical/social system that is working against him. This really does build up the World as a complex antagonist that the hero has to overcome. That's what was missing from S2.",

I don\u2019t think anything compares to it recommendation wise (Very biased); but along the same sci fi lines I\u2019d go with, The Peripheral (On Amazon Prime alternate universe Sci-Fi) The Expanse on Amazon Prime (A little slow but S2 &amp; S3 were amazing in my opinion with the expansion of the plot and otherworldly adventures) 12 Monkeys on Hulu last I checked (Slow but worth enduring, if you\u2019re into it you won\u2019t even notice the speed of the plot you\u2019ll just be anticipating the next step), The 100 (Incoporates a lot of alt cultures and plots as well as an intriguing story line I\u2019d say until mid S5) Dominion (The movie is also a good watch, more in the fantasy direction).

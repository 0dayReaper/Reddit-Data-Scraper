Andy was the worst.\n\n30 Rock is solid, but the last season is a little eh. It's witty, smart, and self depreciating. The characters faced challenges, and even grew in believable ways.",

In my opinion, it comes down to humor style. The Office was funny because Michael Scott was so awkward.  I never got into that.  Each Parks and Rec. character brought their own kind of humor.  Lots of good comedians on the show - Aziz Ansari, Chris Pratt, Adam Scott.  What I loved most about Parks and Rec. though, is the relationships and lives the characters had outside of work.  It reminds me to think about people and remind myself that almost everyone has a passion outside of work.",

They felt more like comedy fodder than anything.  I never wanted anybody to get together, and didn't feel anything when anyone split.\n\nThat said, I'd also say it's the funniest of the bunch.  If I want just pure comedy, I'll go with that.  For low stress, endearing characters that are still super funny that I want to watch succeed, nothing beats Parks.  (Office has grown thinner for me after 8+ rewatches, though at first it was my favorite blend if both worlds)",

Being a mockumentary gives it room to switch over to drama instead of being just a full blown sitcom which gives it some more impactful moments than 30 Rock can have. The \"all the bacon and eggs\" joke would just be one of the 30 good jokes in a single episode of 30 Rock but since P&amp;R is primarily shown as a drama due to the nature of the format it hits harder than it would in a normal sitcom setting.",

I seriously don't get why they can't understand why people are cutting the cable. We have the technology to watch shows when, where and how we want. The only issue is being able to watch *what* we want without paying for a bunch of different services (PS Hulu, people don't want to pay to watch ads either). People are cutting the cable because cable is now outdated. Stop trying to prolong its life online. People are willing to pay for one or two or *maybe* three services right now but if they keep on having to pay for more, they'll just go back to pirating. Corporate greed is gonna be the end of a good thing  :(",

The consumer is not particularly concerned with their profit margins, the consumer wants as cheap and convenient as possible. Right now subscribing to a couple of services is in the sweet spot for both. Splintering is going to diminish the value of each service, making it more inconvenient and expensive, until the inconvenience of pirating is outweighed by the fact that it's free. To put that another way, people are actually willing to pay for something they can get for free *right now*. It's like bottled water, and what they're doing is making the bottle too big and unwieldy to hold. The convenience is what people are paying for, take that away and they'll go back to the tap. \n\nFurthermore, Netflix seems to have no problem producing content with an online only model, which helps them provide a great deal of variety in addition to what they license. Same for Amazon and Hulu. Could networks not negotiate more for licensing their existing properties while cutting a deal with whichever service they're with to help continue producing? Sure, their profits won't be as big as Netflix's, but at this point they're not going to be as big as Netflix on their own either. They'll tank the platform trying to be, this is where they need to adapt. \n\nPeople aren't going to pay what they already are just for a single network's programming. They would probably pay more for a Netflix working with these companies though. With the success of shows like House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Stranger Things and so on, Netflix's name on a program is worth something. A company could sign on with them and continue to produce with both names on the work: NBC + Netflix Presents or something; if other streaming sites see the same consistent success in their original programming, such as Handmaid's Tale for Hulu and The Grand Tour for Amazon, they could do the same thing. Another shtick of Netflix's is reviving, rebooting or otherwise just giving a new home to cult classics that met an early demise. Surely there has to be a potential treasure trove of IP to leverage there. If Netflix worked with Fox to reboot Firefly and you could only subscribe in exchange for a kidney, surgeons would be booked solid for the next year. NBC + Netflix Presents Freaks and Geeks could fund half a dozen more shows. Etc. IMO the revolution has come; it's time for cable networks to pass the crown and bend the knee if they want to survive.",

I'm kind of a sitcom junkie, and 30 Rock does a great job of bridging the gap between studio audience, set sitcoms of the 80s and 90s, with the current sitcoms we have today. (Modern Family, ect). It's self referential humor, small running jokes, and comedic mockery of every tv show trope makes for an incredibly engaging program. One with endless rewatchability and characters that you fall in love with.\n\nI. Love. This. Show. I've had it playing in the background pretty consistently for the last 3-4 years. I'm only slightly panicking about what I'll do when it's gone.

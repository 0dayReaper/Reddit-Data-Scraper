I think the only reason it works is because I've seen every episode so many times, which is probably because it's been on Netflix for so long. I remember it being on Netflix when I was in college and I graduated 6 years ago. ",

Sadly there's so much profit in running your own production studio which is why Netflix has been going crazy with their own shows.

I think Family Guy is in the same boat, I think Comedy Central picked it up from Fox. Expect anything owned by Fox to be cancelled when their contract is up, so we'll eventually lose all of that. Comedy Central might not cancel, but we'll have to see what they do because of Fox breaking up Futurama between two networks.",

I'll try 10 movies and only finish 1.\n\nFrom what I've paid over the years ($8/month then $10) I could own the complete seasons of those shows.  That's what I've done with Spongebob (that left Netflix) and Southpark (can't recall if it was on Netflix).\n\nI think a lot of networks use Netflix to test the streaming waters for little investment while they build up the ability to do it on their own (AMC).  But, I seriously don't want accounts with each individual network.  Nobody wants to do that.",

                                    "comment": "I had no idea this was a thing but I have been doing it for years, and wrote about it [sixteen months ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/45htig/netflix_needs_a_i_have_30_min_before_ill_fall/czy85f2/)\n&gt;I have been falling asleep to Futurama virtually every single night for YEARS. I think it might be the weirdest thing about me. It's not even my favorite show. Not even close. But I think I understand exactly how I got here.\nI started finding it easier to drift off with background noise TV shows, like Frasier, but I found I couldn't watch live actors because on repeated viewings I just thought about the actors as people doing a job and not characters, so I switched to animated shows. Golden Age Simpsons is probably my favorite show of all time, but the moral messages a lot of episodes have got to be annoying after repeated viewings, plus I'm in my 30s now with no kids, I don't relate to family and school stories as much anymore. I tried South Park for a while, but that show can be so savage. Violence, screaming, bodily functions, I can't fall asleep to that. Ditto something like Ren and Stimpy. The animation just looks gross. Boils, boogers, scraggly hairs, ecch. I watched Clone High, which is a lesser known show but it was perfect, except there are only about ten episodes. Every two weeks I was repeating everything. Burned myself out.\nSo then, Futurama. Animated, not cloyingly preachy, not about kids, not excessively violent, over 100 episodes, Simpson style animation and writing. Honestly I find the writing weaker than other shows I went through, parts I find straight up dumb, but everything else was just right. I started falling asleep to Futurama every. Single. Night. For YEARS on end now. Now I just tuck an over the ear headphone around my off pillow ear and place the Netflix playing phone upside down on the bedside table to not disturb the girlfriend. I honestly think I'm addicted to falling asleep to Futurama now. I will have episodes saved on my phone if I'm going somewhere without WiFi access. I have seen (or, more accurately, heard) every episode dozens of times (except for jurassic bark and the sting and the mom one and the seven leaf clover one, because enough with the sad endings and the messages, can't sleep to it. I skip those). I've developed a Pavlovian association where I can fall asleep places I normally wouldn't, like airplanes, or after being woken up unexpectedly, almost always before a single episode finishes. I'll toss and turn for an hour without it but I put on the headphone and I'm out before act 3.\nHonestly it's gotten super weird and I don't know how all this will end. I'm actually opening up Netflix and clicking continue on wherever I am in the series (unless it's jurassic bark, then I click next) the moment I finish this comment.\nThanks to this comment for allowing me to talk about this extraordinarily weird and specific habit of mine.\nTL;DR: yeah, I agree, Futurama is a solid choice here.",

Netflix/Hulu/HBONow costs me roughly $30 a month, and if I'm short on cash, it's easy to cancel one for a month or two. It's a bit annoying having to jump from one service to another but as long as I have SOMEWHERE to watch Futurama and my other favorites, I'll survive. Hulu, for all the shit it gets (and sometimes deserves, admittedly), has quietly become a great source for older network shows. It kind of feels like as Netflix turns more towards original content, Hulu is becoming the \"new Netflix\" for people like me who crave reruns of their old favorites. I'm not happy about giving in to the greed of the networks, but in the grand scheme of things, I'm way happier than I would be paying for cable. \n\nBut I do worry that someday in the near future we're going to run into the problem of all the networks and cable channels splitting off from Hulu/Netflix/etc. to create their own streaming services. That would just complicate everything and ruin the streaming world as we know it. ",

Like, some shows I'll absolutely dedicate the 45 minutes per episode to watch, but for the most part, I watch shows while I'm like, cleaning my room or doing dishes or something because then I don't feel like it's unproductive.\n\nThe same can be said for my gaming, but at least with games I'm far more engaged than a show or movie. It doesn't \"feel\" like I'm unproductive, even though it's essentially the same thing.\n\nDoes that kinda make sense?",

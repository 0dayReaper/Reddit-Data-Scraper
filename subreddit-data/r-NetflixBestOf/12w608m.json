I wouldn\u2019t call it intense, since a lot of the sad stuff is interspersed between comedic stuff, but I\u2019m still thinking about episodes weeks after I\u2019ve seen them. I\u2019d say it\u2019s emotionally resonant, and also pretty relatable. There\u2019s 7 seasons so far, and it\u2019s been renewed for season 8, which is coming out this year. If you want to get a taste for the emotional-ness of it, I\u2019d recommend \u201cJurassic Bark\u201d (a heartbreaker &amp; absolute banger of an episode, according to most ppl), but if you can find the full series, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it to watch it from the beginning for the full emotional impact.",

I finished watching all of The Simpsons a few weeks ago &amp; was very pleasantly surprised (I had low expectations for 2014+, I hadn\u2019t been watching it since then &amp; I\u2019d heard it went downhill).\n\nSpeaking of heart-wrenching Futurama episodes, I just watched Lethal Inspection last night &amp; I\u2019m floored\u2026 I think I\u2019d seen bits of it on TV when it came out, but omfg. The emotional punch of it. I have no words. I think Matt Groening is in my top 5 favourite genres now, haha.\n\nAlso, my friend put me onto Arcane (on Netflix). I\u2019ve very mixed feelings abt it, but the animation is gorgeous, and it is very emotional and angsty. You don\u2019t have to play the game to watch it, I had no idea what was going on when I started it &amp; it still got some tears out of me.\n\nAlso also, another friend suggested a TV show called Dinosaurs, which I\u2019d seen a few episodes of as a kid but I don\u2019t rlly remember much. It\u2019s abt a family of cool/weird dinosaur puppets pre-extinction, and apparently it gets pretty deep/emotional out of nowhere. I think it\u2019s on Disney+, if you\u2019re into that sort of thing.",

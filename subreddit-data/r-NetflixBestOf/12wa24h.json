    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am a university student from the Netherlands, and I am currently researching viewers\u2019 perceptions of lgbtq+ and poc characters from Netflix shows for my bachelor thesis. My study explores how the multi-dimensional, layered, and relatable portrayal of minority characters relates to different viewers' engagement with them. The focus is on Netflix's *Sex Education* in particular. If you have watched this show, I would really appreciate if you could take some time to fill out this short 5-10 minute survey. This will not only help me graduate, but it will also contribute to the wider understanding of why good diversity representation on TV is important. Thank you so much!!\n\nLink to survey: [https://erasmusuniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_ahizowKbmd3W1mK](https://erasmusuniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ahizowKbmd3W1mK) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n67iqi0s6nva1.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1e85a967f462fe504e6271667d3e717272b82484",

You have a whole lot of undefined terms / vague questions.\n\nI\u2019ve watched the show, however stuff like \u201cbehaviors of Adam\u201d instead of specifying what **you** see as Adam\u2019s behaviors/traits relevant to ask about leaves it quite open ended.\n\nYou can argue that\u2019s the point - in which case I\u2019d still disagree it\u2019s an effective study, but at least it would mean you\u2019re doing what you intended.",

Because this study has to do with how perceived similarity might affect parasocial relationships, specific interpretations of the characters are intentionally left open ended as to not skew results.",

It was always something that bugged me a bit about that one. \n\nNot trying to shit on it or anything, it's a great scene in a great movie.",

Probably the most impressive fight scene I've seen ever simply because it never once cuts away from the entire lengthy fight.\n\nThe story is incredibly interesting too and the slow reveal of what's happening makes for a memorable experience.  Not many movies end with me thinking \"what the fuck?!\".",

That takes a lot of practice to do properly.\n\nIn this, the camera sometimes goes away from him, and when it closes in on him he's typically fighting one at a time, slower rate of attacks too; utilising his surroundings.

The detail and thought put into each scene is absolutely phenomenal. Things that seem to be mundane, (like the Oh-Dae Su's gift to his daughter at the beginning), becomes significant later in the movie. Even how Oh-Dae Su talks to Mi Do, from the beginning to the end, changes drastically (pre and post climax). And to top it all off, the quotes are pure poetry. If I recall, one was actually from Ella Wheeler Wilcox. If you like thrillers, this is for you.\n\nP.S. the American remake is trash. Why remake a masterpiece?",

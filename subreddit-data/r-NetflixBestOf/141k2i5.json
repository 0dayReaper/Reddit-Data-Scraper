    "postText": "\n[SPOILERS AHEAD]\n\n\nJust finished the show, i don\u2019t know why i kept going after season 4, that was the right time to stop. I hated the finale episode, mostly because P-tucky\u2019s death. I didn\u2019t like her at first but she was one of the characters that had immense growth throughout the series and I had started to find her absolutely adorable as a person, pure at heart. I could never see it coming and from the writing perspective, it did not make any sense, felt rushed and was complete unnecessary. as if they did it just to add something just for content.   \n\nApart from this - Alex and Piper, i literally skipped past every scene which had either of these two. Such dumbfucks. in the last scene when piper is driving, acting all \u201cnew\u201d, but AGAIN crawls right back to Alex. Like WHAT\u2019S NEW? why even show this?? despite so many people trying to talk sense into her. Piper is one of the worst (in an intolerable kinda way) characters i have ever seen. \n\nI loved that Taystee found a purpose. Gloria was my favourite character, watching her find family at the end was satisfying. Lushchek finally coming clean felt right. \n\nSeeing red and lorna lose themselves was heartbreaking. they were good people and did not deserve it. the writers could have done a lot better i believe. \n\nLastly, recommendations for sone different themed tv shows to heal from this please? i really need to watch something different now",

No purpose in that. I thought her story was one of the saddest.\n\nI get that prison isn\u2019t supposed to be a happy story but damn it just made you feel like crap at the end. The feeling of helplessness was overwhelming. Knowing what happened to Maritza, people want that for real, is just all too heartbreaking.",

It showed what things are really like for so many people. Injustice is real and abundant.

It\u2019s an uncaring and cold system and those that try to fight it and make it better are normally defeated (Caputo is the best example of this). Even Piper, who had probably one of the happier endings, you can see how much prison affected her, she is permanently changed despite being free at the end.",

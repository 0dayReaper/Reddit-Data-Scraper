But as someone who doesn't normally do Real Housewives style reality, I thought they had some interesting angles and were trying to incorporate positive things too like discussion of mental health. Ultimately it felt too fake. \n(not sneering I watch a ton of other types of reality TV so if rich ppl drama is your comfort blanket enjoy)",

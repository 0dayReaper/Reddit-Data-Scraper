Theres not many movies out that id say is 100% the complete package but into the spiderverse is 100% for me.\n\nInstant classic and something ill watch over and over. \n\nAlso on the blu ray, if you just let the movie keep playing through the credits theres some shorts and BTS with the voice actors and directors. Everyone that worked on it had such a passion to make the best movie they possibly could.",

If you buy a Blu-ray you have the movie forever even if your internet is down. There are good enough TVs on the market where you can tell how Compressed 4K content is from some of these streaming services. Take the infamous dark episode of Game of Thrones for example (Idk if they was 1080p or 4K, but the quality was a topic of discussion).",

I used to feel like it's kinda antithetical to the smaller, \"average dude becomes a superhero\" vibe that makes Spider-Man so iconic.\n\nBut this movie REALLY surprised me. Absolutely hangs on to some of the core theming of the character, and brings a totally unique story to the table.\n\nI still get goosebumps during the \"leap of faith\" scene. I am not being hyperbolic either, this is one of the only movies I've ever watched that's given me LITERAL goosebumps.",

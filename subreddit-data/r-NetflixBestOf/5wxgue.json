Then it being late, I fell asleep during the movie. I wake up to him slapping my arm much harder than he needed to so I could hear the old lady. I told him that it was great and then fell right back to sleep. We were woken up the next morning my the other friend trying to climb under the covers with us. We had planned on all sleeping in a tent out back but that seemed dumb since the drunk friend was in there and we had a nice comfy couch to ourselves. We left the friend inside because he reeks of beer. We go out to the tent to find that he never unrolled any sleeping bag and the floor was covered in puke that he had obviously slept on long enough to smash it all down and soak up all the liquid. It looked like smashed oatmeal but smelled much worse. That's my first experience with Blazing Saddles.  ",

My favourite piece of trivia is about the Hedy/Hedley running gag. At one point Mel Brooks' character says something to the effect of, \"oh just wait 60 years and you can sue HER.\"\n\nThere was an actual lawsuit served on the movie by Hedy Lamarr, which probably would not have succeeded, but when Mel Brooks was told, he told them to go ahead and send her a check for $100K because she was a living legend, dammit.\n\nThere is a 30 min or so making of doc with lots of interviews including Wilder that was on YouTube when I watched the movie a couple months ago. Probably an extra from one of the DVDs. Has the Hedy Lamarr story (which I probably butchered in the retelling) and lots more on it.\n\nMore trivia: Mel Brooks has an EGOT.",

After the sheriff is killed, the town demands a new sheriff from the Governor (Mel Brooks). Hedley convinces him to send the town the first Black sheriff (Cleavon Little(R.I.P.)) in the west. Bart is a sophisticated urbanite who will have some difficulty winning over the townspeople.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n&gt; Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and called it a \"crazed grabbag of a movie that does everything to keep us laughing except hit us over the head with a rubber chicken. Mostly, it succeeds. It's an audience picture; it doesn't have a lot of classy polish and its structure is a total mess. But of course\\! What does that matter while Alex Karras is knocking a horse cold with a right cross to the jaw?\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Blazing+Saddles+%281974%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blazing%20Saddles), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blazing_saddles/), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70000380), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q957323).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F5wxgue \"Confidence: 1.06\").

It's the smartest exposition and dissection of race, religion and American Values that we have seen on the big screen.  When I was kid, they played this, uncensored on television (KCPQ in Seattle).  As time went on, they censored the film.  I knew as a kid it was an indictment of hating folks or stupid reasons. Today, this film is even more important - It's selfless.  It's caring and it's funny as hell.  This film has lost nothing. I deeply love westerns - Stagecoach through Rio Bravo to Unforgiven and No Country for Old Men - This movie is an homage for everything important, but doesn't flinch on addressing the social presence of rose colored history.  A hundred years from now, Anthropologists will praise this movie for helping tackle terrible subjects with the most important remedy of all - humor.  ",

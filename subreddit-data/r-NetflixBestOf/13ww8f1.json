    "postText": "I don't know how to describe it shortly so I'll try to explain it thoroughly. After consuming media like series, games, books, etc. I've come to the conclusion that I really like stories were there are some kind of puzzle or game that is resolved by logic. Plus points if it's a life/death situation.\n\n  \nIn regards of netflix shows I've enjoyed Alice in borderlands, primarely the diamond games (and I thought the way of resolving the first game, the one were you decide between two doors, was really cool) and I think squid game was ok, specially the second game, Dalgona. But, for example, I didn't really enjoy the physical games of those series.\n\nOther media I enjoy are the danganronpa game series and the sherlock holme books. Really enjoyed the exhaustive investigation and how the detective didn't find the answer because \"ah he smart\" but because he actually finds proves and uses logic to find the murderer. Similarly I really enjoyed the first part of death note and mental games between L and Kira.  \n\n\nSo, with that in mind could you guys please recommend me some movie/series that keeps this idea of mental game/puzzles? (with the lack of a better word to describe it)",

It is a Japanese manga (you can find online for free) but there is also an anime and even a live action movie.\n\nIt is something of a precursor to Squid Game/Alice in Borderland with the premise that you have to deceive other players to win. What makes it interesting is how the story slightly modifies existing games like musical chairs or poker into Survivor-like social dynamics that become quite complicated.",

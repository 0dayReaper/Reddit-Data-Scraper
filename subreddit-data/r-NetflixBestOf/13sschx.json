Not sure if you can search specifically for Atmos vs surround content, but there will be a badge in the title descriptions for what the show supports.\n\nDune has an incredible soundtrack. The Dark Knight (2008) for regular surround.\n\nThe Gray Man intro. The Glory has an interesting use of Atmos in some parts, a bit more natural with items going off screen getting panned to the surrounds.\n\nEverything Everywhere All At Once",

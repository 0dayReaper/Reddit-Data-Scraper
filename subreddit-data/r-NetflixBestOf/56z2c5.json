Thankfully, I haven't personally experienced anything similar, but I'm definitely the \"worrier\" in my relationship, and my significant other has a bad habit of forgetting to let me know he's made it home safely and/or letting his phone die. I'm constantly trying to imagine how I'd handle it if the worst did happen, and that episode just felt a little too real for me. The characters were very similar to my own relationship, and it messed me up for a few weeks.",

I still think about it a lot, I think it has more of an emotional connection than the others - except maybe Be Right Back, which is the one where the husband dies.\n\nWith both of those episodes, I think the overlying message of the show becomes more poignant - that while technology seems wonderful and exciting, there's always a price to pay, and not everything is what it seems. I find them more relatable than most of the other episodes. I can easily see myself jumping at the chance to relive happy memories of a lost significant other, only to realize I'm in too deep and that the technology is only making it harder to move on. I could find dozens of creepy techno-thrillers like Fifteen Million Merits, or even White Bear... but EHOY and BRB feel more personal.",

Take it too literally it doesn't make as much sense. \n\nYou got people going about their daily grind to keep society running and themselves eating, they have access to trivial pleasures that they use to escape the monotony, *and they love to mock people worse off than themselves,* with zero sense of self-reflection. Aside from basic survival, they spend money both to avoid minor inconveniences (which are themselves monetary schemes, ads) and to acquire meaningless and worthless trinkets.\n\nMany dream of escaping the drudgery and becoming famous like big stars on TV (because the few 'real' stars love to display extravagant, fun and comfortable lifestyles) but in reality this is both a distraction AND just another way to separate them from their hard-earned money. Few people will ever 'break out' into fame and fortuen, in order to break out you have to bend over and allow yourself to be exploited and most of the time you will be used up and spit back out, not even managing to benefit from the experience.\n\nYour big dreams and goals don't matter, the things you take pleasure in can be taken from you and twisted, and throw back in your face... not from malice exactly but more from indifference. It takes an absurd amount of effort (and, by that, money) to even TRY to break out and if you fail you don't get any back, its gone and made someone else richer. Your control over your own destiny is really limited. \"Hard work\" will get you somewhere, but luck and, more importantly, connections to people with influence is what will actually help you win.\n\nAnd the big reveal is that the system is so smooth and effective that it takes its biggest critics and makes them part of the whole edifice. Rewards them and uses them as just one more monetized distraction.\n\nI think that was the one thing in there that really impressed me. It points out that a lot of the people who are 'famous' (in OUR world) for screaming about how backwards, corrupt, nonsensical, and/or disastrous society is (see: most political pundits) are actually wealthy themselves, profiting in large part *because* their diatribes capture an audience which they monetize to enrich themselves. \n\nAnd while they are ABSOLUTELY CORRECT that society is as messed up as they describe, they themselves aren't actually doing anything to change it (because hey, they're perfectly happy where they are) and most people don't care enough to even TRY and change it.\n \nEverything is about entertainment, because everybody just wants to escape the grind of their daily lives. Its easier and more pleasurable to have rebellious thoughts fed to you than to actually think about rebellion.\n\n*****\n\nSee, you could make the same point WITHOUT using a sci-fi dystopia, the episode just pumps it up to ridiculous levels so that it *gets through* and makes you actually think. \n\nOr not. If the episode is addressing a true problem, then its complicit in the system that it portrays.\n\nOR maybe the episode isn't really accurate and life is a lot better than it implies. I think so!",

Like all dystopian sci-fi, its not meant to be realistic but actually entirely symbolic. The genre is a commentary on modern society through satire. This episode happened to be the most symbolic one. Its not even attempting to give answers which I think is probably intentional. The character in the story don't really get an understanding of their situation so neither do we. We only get to see and understand wbst \"they\" want us to see and understand.\n\nThe point was in its themes. Its not meant to paint what the future could realistically be but instead reflect our current reality. Thats why the show is called black mirror. \n\nI think it make sense you didn't like the episode. It was the least concerned with giving us context or answers and simply threw us in the middle of a story already underway.\n\nI thought the story was beautiful amd impactful and that its ambiguous nature made it a lot more powerful than episodes that were more concerned with spoonfeeding us the narrative.\n\nI still think youre compeltely missing the point of dystopian fiction though. Its not at all about the showing the somewhat possible impact of our technological future. Its about commentary on our present through satire. I think that distinction is an important one.",

As in it really could be a drama from 10 years in the future rather the others which all distinctly feel like current shows set in some vague distant future. \n\nDystopian sci fi isnt always the most accessible genre and tends to be a tad polarizing. Since that one felt the least like science fiction and more like a traditional drama, I think it makes sense its the most warmly received episode.\n\nI agree though. I think the 2nd episode is much more powerful in concept and execution. But its also the most abstract and symbolic episode which is far from everyone's cup of tea.",

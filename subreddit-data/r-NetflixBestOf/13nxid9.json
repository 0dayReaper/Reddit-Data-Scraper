I generally love anything by Mike Flanagan and can recomend\u00f3 hin work to anyone. He always touches on topics like grief, religion, family trauma etc in such a graceful and heartbreaking way which keeps you thinking about it for a long time. \n\nThe Rain (Netflix) also has that virus/zombie vibe. \n\nI\u2019m currently watching The Last Of Us (HBO) and I\u2019m obsessed! \n\nLike I said, it\u2019s really hard to recommend anything that is similar because The Swarm is very different to anything I\u2019ve ever seen before \ud83d\ude48 I wish I could help you out more lol",

At best, they're entertaining partly because they're unnerving and partly because they're comedic in their execution and cliches.  \n\n\nJump scares work but they're fleeting (obviously) and are almost always lazy attempts at creating scares.  \n\n\nThe only jump scare I can think of that worked and I applauded was the one in The Haunting of Hill House.",

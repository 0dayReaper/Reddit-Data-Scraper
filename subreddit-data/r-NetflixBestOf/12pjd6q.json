    "postText": "So I just finished watching this 3 episode Norwegian show and I was blown away. Starting from the acting, the cinematography and the amazing effects I was pleasantly surprised. It\u2019s a serious drama, hard-hitting and thought provoking. Please do give it a go if you\u2019re into serious drama based on true events. \n\nWithout getting into too much it\u2019s a show based on Norwegian sailors of WW2. Follows the journey of 2 friends who sail during that time and portrays how their lives are impacted. \n\nIf you plan on watching it please do watch it in the original audio (Norwegian) with your native subtitles.",

But in reality, it's tough to fully block a VPN since it's a bouncing consistency of an IP address. I'm going based on what my experience is, and my experience with PIA is that it's hit and miss whether I get blocked out of Netflix or not with it. There are times where I connect to a network and Netflix tells me I'm using a VPN, than I switch to a different one and it works.",

Look at *All-Star Batman and Robin* where Joker is covered in tattoos. \n\nHonestly, Leto's Joker is *probably* closer to the majority of the comic-Jokers than Heaths is.

I think they couldn't make up their mind between a Joker x Harley flick and a true  Suicide Squad flick - maybe they were afraid the 'Squad couldn't draw those box-office numbers on their own, so they had to put Joker in. \n\nIn any case, I think it's a shame he catches so much heat for being a \"Bad Joker\" when it's mostly on the editors that the movie was messed up and disjointed. \n\nAlso, I think they upped the Joker / Harley romance, and took out the domestic-violence bits, in order to make their relationship more consumer-friendly. We all know Joker and Harley beat the shit out of each other, and there's shades of that in the movie - but they wanted them to end on a happy note... instead of Joker and Harley fighting in the chopper and him knocking her out.

They included Harley Quinn solely for eye candy, since she basically has absolutely no reason to be the squad in the first place. What, they brought her in because she's good with a mallet? \n\nThere's been this trend of obsessive/abusive relationships getting glorified lately.  Mostly since Twilight and 50 Shades of Gray.  It would be really interesting to do a Harley/Joker 'romance' film that actually accurately portrays an abusive relationship.  But, I doubt that'll happen, they certainly tried to glorify the romance in what they showed in Suicide Squad.  Ironically, the original Batman animated series portrayed the relationship far more darkly, with Joker throwing Harley out of a window and nearly killing her.\n\n",

                    "comment": "Just my two cents, and I appear to be in the minority here based on the comments. \n\nPros: it's not like your cookie cutter superhero movie (I seriously have been so turned off by the milking of comic books and origins, I'm burned out). It's an actual end to a story arc, unlike relentless milking (again, burned out). Since it is R rated, it doesn't rely on sometimes-hokey fight scenes (in other words, a guy with indescribable metal claws does exactly the damage you'd imagine). It also had a predictable ending but not your tired old \"overpowered superhero dicks around for comedic effect, has a minor conflict, saves the world at the last second\" feel. And here's the biggest plus for me: it's set in the future, but they did a good job of mixing realistic future tech with normal life. Think of interstellar: still living in cornfields driving diesel trucks and reading textbooks in a school, despite the fact they can fly through black holes in a fancy space shuttle. \n\nCons: it was long. This is usually my first gripe of modern movies, as it seems production companies are unable to make a movie under 2 hours unless it's a G rated kid movie. I don't remember its actual length (I watched it on a plane). But it felt long. Part of that might have been that it was brutal and sad. I had no idea what the story was about, just that it was wolverine. The whole time, I couldn't shake this heavy feeling of dread and despair. It was a fatiguing movie for me to watch. It's hard to describe but that's the least abstract way I can do it. \n\nDefinitely worth at least one viewing, just to round out the story and get a different kind of superhero movie. I don't know how much you've heard about the plot already so I don't want to really go into more about my three biggest gripes with the movie because they're big spoilers. ",

Logan, whose power to self-heal is dwindling, has surrendered himself to alcohol and now earns a living as a chauffeur. He takes care of the ailing old Professor X whom he keeps hidden away. One day, a female stranger asks Logan to drive a girl named Laura to the Canadian border. At first he refuses, but the Professor has been waiting for a long time for her to appear. Laura possesses an extraordinary fighting prowess and is in many ways like Wolverine. She is pursued by sinister figures working for a powerful corporation; this is because her DNA contains the secret that connects her to Logan. A relentless pursuit begins - In this third cinematic outing featuring the Marvel comic book character Wolverine we see the superheroes beset by everyday problems. They are aging, ailing and struggling to survive financially. A decrepit Logan is forced to ask himself if he can or even wants to put his remaining powers to good use. It would appear that in the near-future, the times in which they were able put the world to rights with razor sharp claws and telepathic powers are now over.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n&gt; On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 319 reviews, with an average rating of 7\\.9\\/10\\. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Hugh Jackman makes the most of his final outing as Wolverine with a gritty, nuanced performance in a violent but surprisingly thoughtful superhero action film that defies genre conventions.\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A\\+ to F scale.

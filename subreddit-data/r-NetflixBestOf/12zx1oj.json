    "postText": "*Not exclusive to Netflix*\n\nI realize this question is contradictory as all true crime media is made to be a retelling and dramatization of a crime for the sake of making a show, often at the expense of victims and their families.\n\nI\u2019m just wondering if there is anything that doesn\u2019t focus so much on the ambiguity of a crime/perpetrator, and thus make the audience almost feel worse for them than the victims. *cough cough Capturing the Friedman\u2019s cough cough* (this felt so completely biased and apparently excluded many aspects of the case, but that\u2019s been discussed already. I was going to watch The Jinx but seeing Andrew Jarecki concerned me and I now know of the controversy around it and it\u2019s mode of storytelling.)\n\nAre there any good true crime pieces that avoid these issues? I want to be intrigued and learn about these cases but I do not have any interest in being made to feel like the admitted child sex offender was done dirty!",

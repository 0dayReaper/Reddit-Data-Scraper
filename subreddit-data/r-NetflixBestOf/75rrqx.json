For some inexplicable, profoundly stupid reason, the theatrical cut ruins it entirely by having a monologue at the very beginning explaining the entire situation and what\u2019s going on, instead of having it slowly dawn on you as the movie progresses",

It left me with an awful taste in my mouth, felt like too much structure/interpretation was being jury-rigged in and the additions did not feel like they thematically or aesthetically fit the move.  I loved working my way through it years ago and eventually coming to the conclusion that it fundamentally didn't work, it's just a nonsensical story - all of a sudden seeing \"well, wait a minute, what we actually meant was THIS\" is super jarring.\n\nAnd as the parent stated, \"Killing Moon\" was a brilliant opening!",

I mean, it's much more than that, but it's him getting to experience love and then being okay with dying knowing that he was fortunate enough to experience it. He laughs himself to death because he knows that none of it matters but is still appreciative of the experience he had. It's really what we all do, or at least what we try to. ",

That's why he becomes a demigod, that's the universe granting him special powers so that he can send the airplane engine back. When the universe copies itself over, sometimes there is a copying error and something is duplicated by mistake which then throws the entire universe out of whack. The airplane engine is that thing that is accidentally copied from a parallel universe. That's why they couldn't find exactly where the plane engine came from in the beginning of the movie, because it literally fell out of a parallel universe. \n\nIts also showing that Donnie is so selfless that he's willing to die if it means that everyone else's lives around him get to continue.

It's in reference to Graham Greene, who is being mistaken for Lorne Green, who was in Bonanza. Lorne Green was also in Battlestar Galactica, and the line above was in response to a line from Mary McDowell, who would go on to play the political half of Lorne Green's character in the reboot Battlestar Galactica.\n\nMy mind sometimes daisy chains connections and comes out the other end laughing.

I think the ambiguity in the theatrical cut works so much better but also the soundtrack changes, made for the DC, just don't work as well in my opinion. Which is interesting considering I'm sure I read that the directors cut has Kelly's original choices; he just couldn't afford them when the film was first released. Maybe it's just memories of seeing it for the first time, and being blown away, but it's theatrical all the way for me.",

These excerpts explain a great deal about what is going on in the movie, which seemed counter-intuitive to the movies mystery, according to fans of the original.  However, I disagree with this idea that it ruined the mystery, as the Philosophy of Time Travel excerpts were available on the movies website from the start; the directors cut simply merges the two together.  There is no right or wrong answer to this change, it is simply a matter of preference.\n\nThat's probably the biggest change that was made.  Other, smaller changes that were made are some changes to the soundtrack and score, greater character development to some key characters, as well as some changes to visuals that are largely inconsequential to the movies narrative.",

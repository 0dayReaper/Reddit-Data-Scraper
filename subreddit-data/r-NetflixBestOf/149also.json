    "postText": "Netflix has exciting news for fans of the South African high school drama, Blood &amp; Water! The popular series has officially begun production on Season 4, and soon we will once again hear the familiar words, \"Welcome to Parkhurst High!\" As always, Puleng and the students of Parkhurst will bring back all the intrigue and find themselves not too far away from trouble in the upcoming season.\n\nTo mark this announcement, Netflix SA has released a video on their Twitter account featuring some of the show's key players, who hilariously fumble through the announcement. Set within the walls of Parkhurst High, the video showcases the two main protagonists, Puleng Khumalo (Ama Qamata) and Fikile Bhele (Khosi Ngema), dressed in high school uniforms. Also appearing in the promotional clip are Fikile's boyfriend, Sam (Leroy Siyafa), and Tahira Kahn (Mekaila Mathys), the once embattled head girl of this prestigious institution. The arrival of the fourth season of Blood &amp; Water is a significant milestone for original South African content on Netflix, as it surpasses the three-season mark. Currently, only How to Ruin Christmas shares this achievement with three seasons.\n\n**Source:** [Production of Blood &amp; Water Season 4 on Netflix](https://oddfirm.com/production-of-blood-water-season-4-on-netflix/)",

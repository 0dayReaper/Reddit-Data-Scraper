There is some interconnectedness with a couple characters &amp; the other Perlmutter Shows (he oversaw Disney for those series - Punisher, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Dare Devil &amp; Iron Fist &amp; the Defenders) but The Punisher is the least connected &amp; the connection with the other shows doesn't matter too much. You should be absolutely fine.",

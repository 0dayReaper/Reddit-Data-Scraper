IT HAPPENS AT THE END OF SEASON 4! \n\nWHen I first started watching House, I didn't see it on TV at all. I went and bought Seasons 1-3 on DVD and binge watched. Luckily Season 4 hadn't come out yet. If it HAD, I would've bought it as well, seen the trailer for Season 5, NOT KNOWN WHO AMBER EVEN FUCKING WAS YET, and still know she dies somewhere in that season or next. \n\nLuckily I already knew about it, but I was still livid at the possibility that it could've been fucking ruined by a god damned preview. \n\nAnyway...

I've seen Mike Tyson, one of if not the greatest boxer of all time, called underrated. Literary classics that people are just rediscovering for themselves are regularly labeled underrated. \n\nBy calling something \"underrated,\" you not only imply that thing is good, but you also pay yourself the compliment of implying that you recognize some level of quality in that thing which escapes the inferior perception of lesser mortals. You put yourself in a group of an elite few who recognize the inherent brilliance in the thing \"before it was cool,\" reminding the world of your exquisite taste.  It's the classic hipster cash-in, emphasizing that what you like and what you do doesn't matter, but the people who SEE you liking and doing those things and recognize you for it, that's what matters. \n\nFor the record, this movie has 84% on rottentomatoes. Roger Ebert gave it 3/4 stars.  Empire and Common Sense Media gave it 4/5 stars. By most accounts, this movie is good and funny, but not a perfect 10/10. Does that strike anyone as underrated?",

I hadn't laughed that hard in a long time. I do think some parts of the movie are a bit slow but boy is it totally worth it.

Perhaps paradyish, but incredibly entertaining with the surprising humor that this murder thriller offers. If this sounds good to you, go watch it on Netflix!

There is as much craft to editing a trailer as there is to editing our favorite scenes in the movie. I think the issue lies with the different pressures and incentives faced by editors and directors, and in the tradition of trailers that (I perhaps mistakenly feel) did not spoil major plot elements in the past. Trailers now feel very much like highlight reels of a film I haven't yet seen, rather than a tease that beguiles me into watching the rest. I have heard directors express great frustration at not being allowed to have input in the trailers (and thereby prevent their works from being spoiled), which led to my greater point about different pressures and incentives.",

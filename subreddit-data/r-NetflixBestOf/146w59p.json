I know it's a book series so I assume most of the credit goes to the writer but just the way they made you feel like what your watching could be actually from the future was just incredible. They didn't even invent some bs device that does away with gravity or g forces. They embraced physics! That said they did sci-fi away fuel efficiency and probably time taken to get places but travel time never felt forced like in game of thrones. This show was the best sci-fi I have seen in a long time, that I can't bring myself to watch the final season because then it will be over.\n\nI'm not a book reader but I think I might have to pick this series up.",

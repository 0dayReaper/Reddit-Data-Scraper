    "postText": "Free of course. It also skips the \"Next episode in..\" countdown that comes up when the credits roll. There were one or two other extensions that do it, but this has 1/30th of the amount of code and no dependencies. \n\n[Chrome link](https://goo.gl/vEdKxX)\n\nHere's the code if you care: \n\n...\n\n    var observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutations) {\n\t\tvar isItOne = document.querySelectorAll('.player-autoplay-interrupter'),\n\t\t\tisItTwo = document.querySelectorAll('.player-postplay-still-hover-container');\n\t\tif (isItOne.length) {\n\t\t    document.querySelectorAll('.player-autoplay-interrupter .button.continue-playing')[0].click();\n\t\t    console.log('skipped the interrupter for you'); \n\t\t}\n\t\tif (isItTwo.length) {\n\t\t    document.querySelectorAll('.player-postplay-still-hover-container')[0].click();\n\t\t    console.log('skipped the countdown for you'); \n\t\t}    \n    });\n    var observerConfig = {attributes: false,childList: true,subtree: true,characterData: false};\n    var targetNode = document.body;\n    setTimeout(function() {\n\t    console.log('starting');\n\t    observer.observe(targetNode, observerConfig);\n    }, 10000);\n\n...\n\n\n**Edit:** after watching about 5 hours of tv, I've learned that the extension never has to click the \"Continue watching\" button. Because when it clicks the next episode button every time the countdown starts, netflix thinks you're there clicking next episode every time so they don't interrupt. I should also mention that if you uncheck the extension, you still have to click refresh to turn it off, because the script will have already ran.",

Futurama has 22 min episodes, so I'm going with that. I was not able to find anything shorter in a reasonable amount of time. Now testing on two machines.\n\nEdit 3: I had it working, but then I made minor edits to the code to clean it up, and now it's not working. I never said I knew what I was doing.\n\nEdit 4: It's working again, but not ready to be published. I'll finish later today when I have more time. I wish this didn't take 45 min to test it.",

Throw a traffic analyzer on your laptop and you'll be amazed at how its constantly communicating.

So while you you fall asleep watching Netflix and it runs all night for 8 hours\nOr while you're gone from the house for 10 hours Netflix keeps running. \nThink about what would happen if even a 1/4 of all Netflix users used this.\nNetflix pays for every GB of bandwidth, and like every business they pass on the costs to the consumer. So if Netflix has to start paying for more bandwidth, we will all see out Netflix rates increased.",

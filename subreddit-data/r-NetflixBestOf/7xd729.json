            "comment": "Make sure you check out the movie Christopher Nolan made before Memento.  It's called **Following** and it's superb.  It's in black &amp; white and is barely an hour long, if memory serves correct.  It used to be on Netflix, but I'm not seeing it listed there now, sadly.\n\nYou're better off knowing as little as possible. It would be too easy to spoil this movie by giving away too much... but here's enough to get you started.  It's about a guy in London who is seeking inspiration for writing a novel, so he picks out people who look interesting and he follows them, but he becomes more of a follower than he intended.\n\nIt's such an excellent movie. They list a production budget of $6,000 and I believe it. This is very much a low budget movie, but it's done extremely well. I hope this never gets remade because they'd surely ruin it.\n\nSeriously.  Find and watch Following.  It's brilliant.\n\nEDIT: I added some info, and while doing so I convinced myself to buy the DVD.",

But if you consider directing and writing movies to be an art, I feel like remaking a movie you made earlier in your career just because it may do better now to be sort of compromising your own artistic integrity a bit. If you have a finite amount of time to cement your legacy and contribute to a body of artistic work with new original pieces and you believe yourself to be someone with unique and creative ideas (which Nolan clearly is), why would you waste your own finite time copying something you did all over again just because it will do better now? Seems to be unfulfilling and a waste. The movie still holds up just fine",

Maybe he has much more grandiose ideas for it and wants a chance to put that out there.\n\nOr maybe its a pure cash grab. Coming from anyone but Nolan that would be my first choice. But with him, I'm not so sure.",

It's silly to downvote people just because they didn't like it. \n\nAt the same time, just saying, \"this movie is bad,\" doesn't really deserve to be upvoted because it doesn't add much. Neither does, \"this movie was great,\" but that will always get upvotes as long as it agrees with the majority.",

I have to admit I've only seen LOTR and Memento out of your list (Alien and Gladiator have both been on my list of things to watch though).\n\nI don't think I can actually narrow mine down to a top 5... it's more like I have a top 5 for each mood I'm in and for various genres haha.\n\nIf I have to narrow it down to a general list, and this is way more than 5, so apologies in advance (you really don't need to read the list if you don't want to (: ) --- also in no particular order\n\n1. LOTR as well\n\n2. Johnny English (makes me laugh every time)\n\n3. The Transporter (it's just a solid, all-around satisfying action flick)\n\n4. Anne of Green Gables films (child through adulthood favourite, as admittedly, a lot of these are - part of why they're on my list)\n\n5. Stardust\n\n6. Moulin Rouge \n\n7. George of the Jungle \n\n8. Indiana Jones &amp; the Last Crusader (best of the series imo)\n\n9. The Sound of Music \n\n10. Aladdin \n\n11. Romy &amp; Michele's Highschool Reunion\n\n12. Kill Bill 1&amp;2\n\n13. Dr Horrible's Sing Along Blog\n\n14. Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\n\n15. the old Sherlock Holmes films starring Basil Rathbone\n\nAs you can probably tell, I tend to love more feel-good type films. I do enjoy watching a lot of other types as well, but these are kind of like my comfort-blankets of movies that I will re-watch relatively frequently. ",

There's a lot of other movies that I like just as much. \n\nYou've gotta see Alien if you can handle suspense! It's as good as Sci-Fi gets. \n\nGladiator is pretty nostalgic for me because it was the first R movie I saw and my dad rented it when my mom was out of town haha. Plus, I think it has some of the best quotes any movie. \"Are you not entertained?\" is still quoted all the time. Man. Just talking about it makes me wanna watch it again. It's probably my definitive #1 to be honest, just because of the emotional value it has for me. \n\nLet the Right One In is incredible. It's very dark and bleak and there's plenty of blood. But it's more of movie about friendship wrapped up in an engaging story. It feels like a non-sexual romance to me. The cinematography is amazing and it's a lot of beautiful Swedish scenery. Lots of snow! The kids are fantastic actors. It is a fairly slow movie though, so you have to have some patience. Especially since it's in Swedish... so most likely need subtitles. There is a remake that's in English and it's supposedly pretty good. I just haven't gotten around to seeing it. \n\nAnd yeah, our movie choices are definitely pretty different haha. I like darker stuff most if the time. I would have added:\n\nThe Shining \n\nThe Descent\n\nThe Witch\n\nSilence of the Lambs \n\nDrive\n\nEx Machina\n\nTropic Thunder\n\nHot Fuzz\n\nThe Big Lebowski\n\nYoung Frankenstein\n\nFerris Bueller's Day Off (At least I have a couple light hearted ones...)\n\nI have to stop myself from typing more cause it will just go on... \n\nI actually liked Moulin Rouge a lot. It's one of my sister's favorite movies so I've seen it a few times.\n\nGeorge of the Jungle is a nice goofy movie. Watched it a couple times as a kid. \n\nI was never that big on Indiana Jones for some reason. They were good, but never meant that much to me. Speaking of Harrison Ford though, I loved both the original Blade Runner and 2049. \n\nAladdin is also great! I love a lot of older and newer animated movies. Finding Nemo and The Incredibles are my favorites. But older stuff like The Lion King is also amazing. \n\nBoth Kill Bills are great movies. Enjoyed those a lot.\n\nProbably seen Dr. Horrible's 5 times now. It's fantastic!\n\nHaven't seen the rest. I'm ashamed of how many classics like Mary Poppins I've never seen.\n\n\n\n... May have written a little too much.",

I actually haven't put much effort into compiling my favourites before, so this was an interesting exercise for me. \n\nAnyway, you should know that you and your movie list will be partially at fault for my decreased levels of productivity during my upcoming spring break :)",

It might be obvious and you\u2019ll learn once you start taking classes, but the prescribed readings and suggested/recommended ones are really helpful towards helping you construct a good written piece. \n\nIt\u2019s not just about analysing characters and obvious themes, but your work must include your own interpretation of the text. Rather than analysing the surface ideologies (obvious themes), it would be even better if you could dig deeper and find latent (hidden) ideologies that challenge the obvious themes of the texts if that makes sense. \n\nTeachers look for original pieces with interesting ideas and arguments so if you have ideas for how you want to go about writing your piece, find articles from Deakin Library Database to support your arguments! \n\nYou will be writing and reading heaps, so if you ever feel overwhelmed or need help with writing, you can reach out to Deakin\u2019s Writing Mentors, or Smarthinking for tutoring and feedback! \n\nHope this helps! :)",

There are always some books that don't click and are difficult to engage with, but I have found there is usually enough freedom in the assessment tasks to allow for this. Personally I have found picture book analysis to be the most challenging component.\n\nThese are the current lists for two first year units, but it can change quite significantly between trimesters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALL101**\n\n***Books***\n\nAlice's adventures in Wonderland Lewis Carroll\n\nBloody Chamber and Other Stories Angela Carter\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale Margaret Atwood\n\nThings fall Apart Chinua Achebe\n\nMetamorphosis and Other Stories Franz Kafka\n\nWe Need New Names NoViolet Bulawayo\n\n***Movies***\n\nLabyrinth\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n\nStories we tell\n\nHer: A Spike Jonze Love Story\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALL102**\n\n***Books***\n\nDracula Bram Stoker\n\nThe Big Sleep Raymond Chandler\n\nThe Monkey's Mask Dorothy Porter\n\nAriel Sylvia Plath\n\nBirthday Letters Ted Hughes\n\nFahrenheit 451 Ray Bradbury\n\nBitch Planet Kelly Sue DeConnick\n\nJane Eyre Charlotte Bronte\n\n***Movie***\n\nA Girl Walks Home Alone at Night",

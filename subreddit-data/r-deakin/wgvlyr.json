Would you recommend the course and online learning? How difficult/thorough is the content and what\u2019s the employability for Deakin engineers? Cheers :)",

I have no opinions on it, some people go into it because they want to do embedded sys like a friend of mine did or they want to do robotics kind of things.  It can be very hands on, if Matthew Joordens runs part of the units in it still, it will be of a very decent quality.  \n\nI prefer pure electronics, radio and chip design, and so stayed with electronics.  Never regretted it.  \n\nIts what you make of it though!",

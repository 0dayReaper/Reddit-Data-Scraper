    "postText": "Hello! I'm an international student and am considering applying for an undergraduate degree in something IT-related for the year 2023. \n\nWhile endlessly researching Australian universities, I came across Deakin and what actually pulled me in was the VARIETY of scholarships they're offering. \n\nLike really, this is the only university with such HUGE scholarships for international students. But that also made me highly doubt just WHY do they have such offers. \n\nIt seems like they're not big on reputation and have mixed reviews from students overall. \n\nSo they might just be trying to get more diversity but I want to know what people REALLY think of the uni. And I also just saw articles of their recent scam SMS thing and a professor being in jail for MURDER. \n\nI just NEED to know what people think and know of the uni so please tell me. \n\nPLEASE HELP ME",

It\u2019s reputation is pretty good, it has the third best sports science program in the world. It might not have the global reputation that Melbourne has, but it\u2019s definitely a world class university. The student experience is pretty amazing.",

My first uni experience was 20 years ago back home in Canada in thr mid 90\u2019s. A lot has changed and uni is sooooo much easier now. Deakin is excellent for many undergrad and post grad courses. But it\u2019s also a very supportive uni that imo places an emphasis on helping its students to succeed in their degree. I\u2019m undergrad Psych and very happy.",

I\u2019d highly recommend it, I was going to go UniMelb but Deakin is a lot more flexible and I think actually cares a bit more about students than it\u2019s own prestige (but it is gaining in rankings and it\u2019s research).",

As someone who has hired people, the name of the uni means nothing and experience is everything. If you\u2019re in a supportive environment and make the most of the experiences (and have access to them) you\u2019ll be far better off. Not advocating for either way, but I do laugh when people think that going to Melbourne will automatically put them in the plum job pool. It\u2019s not the case",

It helps you study at your own pace! With the trimester system, you can choose to slow down with your studies or even fast-track them! Another things that I really like about Deakin is that, they\u2019re very inclusive of people from different genders, sexuality and cultures!\n\nI\u2019m a pretty happy student here and I think you\u2019d also like it! They are pretty reputed in terms of student satisfaction!",

    "postText": "A little backstory I have applied for Bachelor of Commerce in Deakin university and I have gotten a seat but need my GTE to be approved for a confirmed seat. I did International GCE A Levels and got AAB which is 96 in ATAR Equivalent. And an IELTS score of overall 8.  Unfortunately I do not have many extracurriculars\u2026 other than being active throughout highschool in sports and being the Sports Head in my school for y13. Due to Covid in my country it was also hard for volunteerism but i have around 30 hours of volunteering including volunteering in the national parade. I have three Reccomendation letters from my teachers compiling all of the info here\u2026 Do i have any luck for the Deakin International Scholarship ( 25% off tuition fees) or the Deakin Vice- Chancellors International Scholarship ( 50% / 100% off tuition fees )",

    "postText": "As the title says, Im wondering if it\u2019s possible to transfer between different courses. I\u2019ve been accepted into a Bachelor of Biomedical Science at Deakin, but I\u2019d love to get accepted into a Bachelor of Science at Unimelb so I can go down the Veterinary pathway. Is there any way I can go about transferring at the end of the year? Are there any credits that I can get? I\u2019ve tried calling the unis and both lines are busy.",

Apply via VTAC to Unimelb at mid year 2023 or start of the year 2024 to transfer.\n\nThey will look at your WAM/GPA and possibly VCE if completed within the last 2 years. Uni grades will be the biggest factor. \n\nWhether you get credit for prior study will depend on the units you take in you current degree.\n\nAlso, if you applied via VTAC this yeay you can change your preferences to have Unimelb science at the top after the January offers come out. You might get considered for February if Unimelb participate.",

    "postText": "Jeez is it difficult to get a proper email reply from them. I pay $20,000 a trimester for them to send me a 2 sentence email reply with misinformation and barely any information about studying abroad. \n\nIsn't the first time to receive an unprofessional reply also. Any of you had the same ordeal? You would expect a university to at least some standards of communication.",

Go to hand the form in and am told I hadn't got the most important signature I needed, which was meant to be very early on, and couldn't do it. I was fucking livid. Missed an amazing opportunity because nobody bothered to tell me a major component of my application despite regularly checking in with them. ",

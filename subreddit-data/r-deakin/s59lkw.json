In many cases, Deakin College staff are involved in the delivery of the same units on the main campus. Entry into your second year is based on your performance during the diploma, usually requiring a WAM (weighted average mark) of 50 or higher. Units at the College can usually be taken across 3 trimesters instead of 2, so you can have a more flexible first year study period.  \n\n\nSource: I am a current Deakin College unit chair, and have been actively involved in the delivery of my unit and other related units at Deakin University for the last 5 years.

I myself had my own experience with motivation problems and so on.  \n\n\nIt can be quite difficult to adjust to learning, especially when you've potentially lost 2 years of learning. Deakin College could be a place to bridge that gap. Once you've accepted your offer - you could speak to your Academic Coordinator and enquire with the coaching for success program - which is currently run by Rachael.  \n\n\nStatistically speaking, from my own classes 99% of students with 80% or more attendance pass the units. So you should focus on high attendance first. The next thing is to ensure that you submit all assessments. Generally the best way to make this not a stressful nightmare is to submit things up to 1 week before the dates. I always recommend submitting a week early and relaxing with your spare time, instead of dragging your feet and stressing out.  \n\n\nSo yeah, go to your classes, hand your work in, and you'll be fine. If you skip classes and miss submissions you will quickly be out of pocket and failing classes. Taking a gap year to develop some personal time management and discipline is not a bad idea either.",

            "comment": "Ive read through the replies so far. I hope this advice helps, it's based on my own experience upskilling and been restricted by systems in place.\n\nThe first bit is let yourself be at ease, I know your family want to put the pressure on you right now because they just want you to be okay and they think this is the best way for you right now. The whole truth is that you don't have to get everything done right now or in 4 years and such, the truth is despite your struggles in yr 12 you absolutely can pass and even continue to become a high achieving student if you want. \n\nSo here are some options of how to approach the next year to give you some hope.\n\nMove out of home, take part in that first step of independence a lot of students take at this stage of their lives and while you study live with other students who are studying with the chance that you can inspire, work with and help each other, you'll need to apply for accommodation now though places fill quickly. This will let yourself grow and learn responsibility and accountability. I expect this can all happen with your health needs and upcoming surgery with good planning.\n\nYou can change your mind, you might find that this pathway or career choice isn't for you. And then, you can change your mind again. Come back for that degree or any at any point in time. So if after any amount of time even as much as 2 yesrs from now you make this choice, thats okay.\n\nEducation is a crucial part of society but in the short term you're just trying to get a job, so do that, get yourself a part time casual or full time job In any industry as long as you can do the work because you can absolutley work and study at the same time. And if you manage to land a job no matter how insignificant in the industry you want you're already more advanced along your career path than any of your peers, so look for a job. Don't think of it as money to spend either, it's always about work experience at this point.\n\nThen I hope you're more of an expert than any generation at self care stuff but this little bit is to add to your armory of those skills. Find a community that shares your value system and take part in that group. For me it was scouts. And of course I'm not encouraging you find people that would cause you harm. It should always be a place that helps you be the best version of yourself. But the most important thing is that there is an actual value system, not a flavour of the day reaction to society or individuals, something that will guide you through the rest of your life.\n\nI say the next bit because I thought I had to do it all at once and suffered the consequences, I could have taken my time and still ended up in the same place but much happier and healthier.\n\nYou might be thinking at this point how will you find time for yourself. This is when choices matter, because no matter what you do, work, study, socialise, take care of your health, you'll never have or find the time. You'll only ever be able to make the time. So this is the last bit I'll give you. Make time for what matters to you, no matter what that is, because you won't get that time back and if you're lucky there will be time to do the other thing later. Your choices are going to matter, but they will be your choice, so it's not good or bad, just a choice.\n\nYou'll be okay \ud83d\udc4d",

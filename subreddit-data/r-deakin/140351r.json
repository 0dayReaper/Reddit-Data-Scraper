    "postText": "\nI submitted my eCAF for HECS HELP on a a few days ago and it was approved the next day. However the loan money will not be incurred until the census date in August 2023. I understand that HECS HELP loans are indexed after being 11 months.  My question is : does the 11-month period for indexation begin from the date when the loan money is first taken out in August, or does it start from the date of eCAF approval?",

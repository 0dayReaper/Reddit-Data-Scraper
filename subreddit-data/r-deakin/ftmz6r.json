    "postText": "So I saw someone ask about urgent mental health help during these tough times, but just needing some help of my own in a bit of a different circumstance. \nAlso just putting in a Trigger Warning here!! \n\nSo I\u2019m registered with the DRC about some medical issues, but in the past month I\u2019ve had a bit of a relapse in self harm, but I don\u2019t actually have any diagnosed mental health issues. Is their any way to get support from anywhere at deakin, whether that be the DRC or somewhere else? I don\u2019t really want/don\u2019t think I can go to a doctor about this. Just need some advice right now (as I\u2019ve been through this before). \nCheers in advance :)",

If you go to the doctors and ask them to write you a mental health plan and be completely open and honest about everything you will be eligible to get 10 bulk billed sessions a year with a psychiatrist. And if you find a bulk billed doctor you won\u2019t have to pay for anything regarding it. \n\nOtherwise deakin provides 6 free counselling sessions and if they and yourself feel you need more they will recommend you to another counseller.",

            "comment": "So the thing with the DRC is that they support you based on your symptoms, not based on your diagnosis. But if you're wanting support based on your symptoms you're probably gonna need your GP to fill out the forms.   \nThat's OK, because you'll likely need forms to get hold of a Mental Health Plan which will allow you to access psychology - and friend, it sounds like that's something you could really do with right now.   \nYou can also get free counselling from the psychologists and social workers at Counselling and Psychological Services - I've used them in the past when I was melting down in the middle of a placement. They are really nice and understand what its like being a student, and can give really helpful ideas for finding other ways of coping with that anxious impulse.   \n\n\nBig quarantine hugs friendo.",

Definitely email the medical service and also call then if you feel up for it. I don\u2019t know what kind of service they\u2019re running at the moment but please make it known to them that you\u2019re struggling and need mental health support. They usually offer Skype appointments so I imagine during covid this would be no different. \n\nHere\u2019s some links\n[24 hours support ](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/help/emergency-and-crisis-info/24-hour-support-and-crisis)  \n\n[book an appointment or contact ](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/health-and-wellbeing/medical-centres)",

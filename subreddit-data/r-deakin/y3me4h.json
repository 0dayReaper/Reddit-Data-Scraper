    "postText": "I am an international student and I got into Deakin for Masters of Creative Design and Griffith (gold coast) for Master of Design.\nThe curriculum is visibly different for both and I feel a bit conflicted, so I wanted to know- \n\n1. What the College life is like (for Masters students) at each University, and 2. Melbourne is of course a much larger city and probably has more opportunities. What's life like for a uni student in each city- Gold Coast (and Brisbane) and Burnwood, Melbourne",

I like Deakin, though be prepared to travel 1 hour each way to get to Burwood if you live close to the CBD, or else be prepared to live in and around Burwood which is a bit boring. I love the Goldie so that would be my pick (sorry deakin). Weather is so much better too.",

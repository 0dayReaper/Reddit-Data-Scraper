    "postText": "I just became a DUSA member the other day and I\u2019m looking into getting discounted tickets for an OWeek event. On the website for the event it says that a \u201cvalid DUSA membership number is required\u201d for each ticket transaction\u2026 so I have some confusion\n1. Where can I find this membership number? Or is it referring to the phone number associated with my membership?\n\n2. The page clearly lists non-member prices and a sale period for non-members, but also says a DUSA number is required for each individual transaction\u2026 surely that is a mistake and you don\u2019t need some level of membership to attend at all?\n\n3. Also I can\u2019t buy pre-sale and discounted tickets for a non-member friend, yeah? Would love it if I could lol",

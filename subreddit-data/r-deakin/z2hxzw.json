            "comment": "You don't really need to worry about competitiveness until maybe honours. \n\nFor both psych and crim they don't start counting your WAM towards honours until 2nd year. So first year is all about learning the content and of course just doing your best and seeing if the degree is what you truly want to do. \n\nCriminology doesn't do exams. \nPsychology does but not every unit does them.\n\nI think it truly depends on what area you are most interested in. Say you want to psychologically work with criminals, then I would recommend doing both the double degree of crim/psych. But if you don't want to work in the criminal justice system, maybe just skip the crim side of things and stick to just the psych.\n\nAgain, depends on where your interests are and how much you want to succeed.\n\nJust so you know, uni is not competitive like high school and you should stop thinking about it being competitive now. Otherwise you'll be too focused on being the best rather than enjoying your studies. And the only way to get through your studies at uni is by enjoying the content.",

Like the tertiary education stuff!\n\nAnd I am doing the double degree of crim and psych! I love it! Some units are eh of course but most are really fascinating and interesting.\n\nI will say: criminology is all about theories and how to come up with prevention strategies for crime! So keep that in mind in case that is not what you are interested in!",

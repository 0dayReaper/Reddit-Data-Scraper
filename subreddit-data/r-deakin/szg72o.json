Immigrating to Australia for it, It is a big investment of my time and money so I wanna clear my questions about this.\nThank you",

            "comment": "Overall, architecture is great if you enjoy learning about architecture in the built environment. You'll learn how to research, develop critical thinking and problem solving skills to designing buildings.\n\nYou'll learn art, history, structure and technical drawings, sustainability and technology and design over 5 years. It is a lot.\n\nYou technically don't need to know anything prior to starting and you will be given classes to learn these softwares however, you'll be at a greater advantage if you know and are competent at softwares.\n\nYou should at least have basic understanding of how to draw in perspective, orthogonal and oblique drawings.\n\nDepending on the university you go to, your semester or trimester is only 11-13 weeks. It's a very short amount of time for the amount of learning you'll be embarking on.\n\nWhile it's not impossible to pass design with purely hand drawing skills, you'll be at greater advantage if you harness the power of autocad, bim and adobe products.\n\nStart with autocad, slowly work your way up to revit for Archicad (revit preferbly) by your 3rd year.\n\nPhotoshop for anything creative. Illustrator for clean vector diagrams and InDesign for portfolio and poster development.\n\nArchitecture is incredibly hard because you learnt to be the jack of all trades.\n\n\nIt will be the hardesr 5 years of your life (including masters).\nAll the best\n\nNote: I have graduated with a masters and been working professionally for 5 years.",

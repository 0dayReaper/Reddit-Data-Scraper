    "postText": "Hey guys, just had a question about the atar requirements for the scholarship, on the website it says 95 atar is the eligibility requirement, does that mean that if i get a 95+ atar and get into an eligible course, I'd get the scholarship guaranteed, or is there limited spots, and they just offer the scholarship's to the highest atar's? Curious cause it seems like a pretty good deal, but the course at deakin i'm looking to get into doesn't seem as strong as other uni's and i got a 95.1, so just scraped it in. Appreciate it if anyone could answer, cheers",

It\u2019s normally very competitive and is never a guaranteed thing as it rewards best of the best, the ATAR eligibility is their cut off not a guaranteed level. \n\nAgain please take this with a grain of salt, scholarships may be VERY different but this is what we were told their masters is like and other internal application processes so I could be VERY wrong :)) \n\nBut none the less still apply. Apply for everything you can, it\u2019s ALWAYS better to get a No than it is to wonder what if?",

I'm sure you found your answer already, but for anyone reading this in the future - you can enrol late, you just might not be able to enrol in all of the classes you want or get the tutorial times that you want. They do fill up. If you're flexible it should be fine. Final enrolment deadlines are all listed in the handbook (which you can find online at www.deakin.edu.au/handbook)",

You\u2019ll probably get an email with info about enrolment day, but you can probably enrol yourself as soon as you\u2019ve accepted your offer.

Specifically how long it took to hear back and find out if the request was approved or denied after submitting the online form. Thanks!",

All part of the Deakin management plan to claw back the costs of student facing services so that the executives can keep getting bonuses and have junkets overseas.\n\nMy advice is to keep hassling. I had a very simple request take nearly three months last year for someone to make a yes/no decision. I wrote every couple of weeks and wasn't even getting responded to. Involve DUSA if you need to.\n\nOverloading is something that they won't take lightly and will need a bit of investigating. It will depend on where you are at in your studies and what your previous track record has been. It's generally only allowed when there would be an unreasonable impact on not doing the extra unit. eg. Last unit in the degree and you would have to wait another whole year to do it and graduate.",

You have to wait for results of the previous trimester to be released. But not sure what the process would be",

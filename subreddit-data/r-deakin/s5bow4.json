    "postText": "Hello r/Deakin community!\n\nHappy new year! Welcome to all the r/Deakin newbies, and to all the stalwarts of Deakin - thanks for sticking with us. \n\n2022 will be an interesting year - welcome to year 3 of working and studying in a pandemic... We're still missing our international buddies studying with us from all over the world, and we are waiting to see what the uni wants to do about in-person classes (lectures) and seminars (tutorials), and how it plans to keep us safe on campus. We've also said good-bye to so, so many staff members, and no doubt this year will take a lot of adjustment as lots of things change around campus and in our faculties. \n\nCongratulations to the massive amount of students who have completed their entire degree from home and will be graduating this year - that's huge. We can't wait to hear about your experiences and cheer you on in your final year. And for all of you (like me) who are still plugging along part-time, just getting started, or are maybe half-way through... we believe in you! We can do this together.\n\nSo there is a lot to discuss in 2022!\n\n\n\n**What would you like to see in r/deakin this year?**\n\nWe'd love to hear from the r/deakin community about what you'd like to see from the sub in 2022, and how you think we should be growing this little sub. It could be weekly discussion threads, study groups, course discussions, AMAs or Q&amp;As... Or something else you'd like to see that you think would make this place better and more vibrant! Let us know in the comments.\n\n**Are you interested in becoming an r/deakin moderator?**\n\nWe're still a small community, and our mod team is small to go with it - but in 2022 we will be recruiting some new moderators to jump on board and help out with building this community a little more. If you have experience building communities and are interested in helping r/deakin grow and evolve this year, drop us a line via modmail and let us know how you'd like to contribute. We'd love to hear from you!",

            "comment": "So sorry to hear you're having such a hard time. \n\nI'm probably not of the age group you are looking for friends in (I'm a mature age postgraduate student), but wanted to wish you well and let you know I think you're very brave for moving to a whole different country to study. \n\nMake sure to use the support services available from the uni and take care of your mental health above all else. If you think it's going to affect your studies call it out to your teachers early; they will usually be very understanding. The worst thing you can do is keep it all to yourself and let it build up and build up until everything is terrible (ask me how I know...)\n\nIt's O Week so there's probably some good social opportunities happening around campus where you could get to know people? \n\nBest of luck and I really hope things look up for you soon \u2764\ufe0f",

            "comment": "Im so sorry you feel that way. My wife and i are often at waurn ponds campus. I'm currently doing placement for the rest of this week. But during week 1, I'm happy to catch up and chat.\nImportantly, there are help programs out there provided by deakin. I was involved in the peer mentor program that helps guide you towards all the support that's available. Check your deakin emails regarding peer mentor sessions.\nIm a mature age student btw. I've often setup study groups for the units I do, so I'm quite comfortable reaching out. \ud83d\ude00\nOh, also, I'm not international but my wife is foreign so I think that helps me understand your situation a little better.\nBut as I said, even if we don't catch up, I encourage you to read the emails related to the peer mentor programs and also reach out to Deakin University student association (DUSA) as they so events and have such a diverse group of students organising different cultural events that may in fact be culturally relevant to you depending on where you're from.\n\nAll the best any way. \ud83d\ude00\n\nEdit. Send me a DM if you're OK with me as a friend or even a helpful mentor figure as a friend in a different age bracket can be incomfortable for others. I can give you my student email.",

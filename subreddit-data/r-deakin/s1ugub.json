    "postText": "I applied for the Master of Social Work at Deakin but my application must\u2019ve been a little too late, as I wasn\u2019t given a specific reason but I was rejected. But I still want to give anything a shot to become a social worker!\n\nI am a graduate of a bachelors of criminology at Deakin and I want to get into being a social worker, a case work to be specific. I\u2019m open for any suggestions!\n\nI\u2019ve sent emails to discuss alternatives to student central but also wanted to try my shot here.\n\nI am also wondering if I can try and apply for the bachelors and then when applications for the masters open again, can I transfer?",

This may not be the route you were thinking of, but VET courses are highly valued in the sector and there are courses in Case Management specifically that will help you get that all important first job. I did the Diploma in 2019 and it made me eligible for some challenging but awesome roles. It took less than a year to complete and gave me the context I needed to choose the right degree, having met lots of people in the field and seeing the range of work a case manager might perform.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI'm posting to raise awareness of a unit I chair which can be taken as an elective from anywhere in the Uni but is generally unknown outside my Faculty (Arts and Education). The skills are useful across all academic study areas, and I've worked hard to make the course enjoyable with a Study Guide full of real-world examples of arguments, and quizzes to practice your skills on as you learn. \n\nIf you'd like to see a sample of the Study Guide, DM me. Official course blurb is below.\n\nCheers everyone\n\nOFFICIAL COURSE BLURB\n\nThe capacity to develop and evaluate arguments is an invaluable skill across all academic disciplines, including philosophy, politics, science, law, business and media studies.\n\nThis unit provides an introduction to some key principles  of critical thinking and logical reasoning. You will learn a range of  different techniques - including how to distinguish arguments from other  forms of communication (such as assertions, recommendations and  personal insults!), analyse the structure of arguments, detect common  reasoning errors and last but not least, develop some sound arguments  yourselves.",

I assume you mean a fresher, or firstie?\n\nAlso, do you mean big 4 banks - Commonwealth, Westpac, ANZ, NAB?  \nOr, big 4 accountants - Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG?  \nOr, the biggest 4 by market cap - Amcor, ANZ, BHP, Brambles?\n\nIf you're a first year, just focus on your degree. You will be bombarded with internship opportunities once you get to 2nd/3rd year.",

Could be useful to get a few questions answered with your own personal situation/goals in-mind.\n\nI've found them to be handy in the past at least anyway.",

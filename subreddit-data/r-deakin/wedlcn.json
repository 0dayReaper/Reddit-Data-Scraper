However I have also been working software engineering positions over the last few years while studying part time. \n\nI'm not exactly sure about the software engineering degree coursework. However I can say that the job market currently for software engineers is one of the hottest in the world. I know I'm a little bias in saying that, but the demand for skilled software engineers is huge. \n\nOne suggestion I have is consider if the value you're getting from the software engineering degree is worth the extra year of study, especially in comparison to Computer Science. IMHO employers will likely consider them equally valuable. But definitely do your own research on that as that is just my opinion.",

    "postText": "I want to do Bachelor of IT, and I was browsing deakin's website, and the entry requirements are 25 study score in EAL, and 20 study score in any other english, and it also says that ATAR scoring is a part of the selection consideration, but doesn't tell me the minimum ATAR needed to get into the course like any other uni would, does anybody know who can help me?",

These number are also the ***minimum*** numbers, so if you are eligible for SEAS your ATAR actually might be lower than theses marks they put up on the website.\n\nAn example I can use to explain is I was offered to do law/science at deakin and the selection rank on the website is: **92.4** but I only received raw ATAR of about 83.6 however I was offered because i had SEAS, special consideration like non english speaking background, going to under-represented school and etc.\n\nIt's confusing, but hope it helps",

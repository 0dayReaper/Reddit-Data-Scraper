    "postText": "Hello! i\u2019m a prospective student wanting to study bachelor of psychology. I\u2019m leaning towards Deakin because i\u2019ve heard a lot of good things about it. Could anyone please share your experience in Deakin? How is the culture, learning experience and the psych department? And also, does anyone know what\u2019s the difference between bachelor of psychology and bachelor of arts (psychology)? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you! :)",

The faculty are fantastic, the lecturers are compassionate and have handled the COVID thing really well. I can't fault psych staff or content at all. \nI also study as an online student and the support for students is great.",

It can make you feel a bit disconnected if you're not careful about your mental health. If you can make it to a seminar or class, please try to get to them. You can participate alongside everyone instead of watching everyone else participate.\n\n\nMake sure you do the assigned readings. In psych there are stats you'll need to learn and also you'll have to learn to read and deconstruct scientific papers. By doing the assigned readings you'll gain a better understanding of the topics, be able to deconstruct reports better, and engage in meaningful discussions around the readings. Which leads me to...\n\n\nParticipate in the discussion boards. I went in to uni as an online student thinking I didn't need anyone. I was wrong. Having the discussion board there is great. Don't get bogged down on reading every.single.comment. it will take up too much of your time. Find headings that interest you or create your own post and end it with a leading question that engages more people than just your lecturers (But don't be surprised if they answer you and join in! They love what they teach and want to engage with students. It's a great thing when they respond)\n\nCreate a study space that feels like a study space and won't distract you (as much as possible). I have my desk set up similar to how my classroom desk looked at tafe crossed with my office desk at work. It puts me in the frame of mind to be productive and like I'm part of a professional engagement. \n\n\nIf you can get physical copies of your textbooks, do so. Try to get them as cheap as possible via borrowing from the deakin library (accessed through your deakinsync and mailed out to you) or second hand on plenty if forum boards (fb,  studentvip, etc). Having physical uni items helps the experience feel real and connected. \n\n\nJoin DUSA if you can. I LIVE in my DUSA swag. Hoodie, water bottle,  the calender is on my wall with all my exams and assignment due dates on it. Even though COVID has wrecked physical events, they still run fun stuff like zoom movie nights and have a Facebook group (I don't have fb so I have no idea what its called, sorry!) \n\n\nI also have a Slack study group of people in all stages of psych learning. We all started off in the same topic but have since seperated to different units for the most part. Having people in your corner, going through the same stuff as you is so helpful. Even if you've never met them or never will, it's awesome having a positive loop of information, encouragement and general togetherness. There's also a different facebook group for dealing students I believe. Someone else might be able to help with that  \n\n\nHopefully these help. Do your readings, ask questions, make a good friend or two in the class and start a small study group. You'll do great. Psychology is daunting and full on but it's also fascinating and so much fun. \n\nI wish you all the best!!\n\nEdit: some horrific autocorrects  due to responding on mobile. Expanded the response a tad.",

            "comment": "I'm doing a bachelor degree of psych science at Deakin and it's been a great experience so far. I have no experience with other universities, but Deakin has not disappointed me. I think the difference between art and science is that the art degree requires you to have electives from the art faculty while science requires you to have other health/psych electives. I think the purpose of the arts one is to explore your interests more while at uni.",

There's heaps of clubs/societies to join; most of the tutors and lecturers are competent and interested in what they do; there's great timetable flexibility to the point where you should be able to get all your classes and tutes scheduled on one or two days.\n\nIf you've got any more questions just send me a message. I can send you some unit guides etc. so you'll have an idea of the content you'll be studying, too.",

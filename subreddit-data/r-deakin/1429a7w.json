    "postText": "I live in WA and was looking at potential Unis to do my Sports Science undergrad. I was wondering what the on campus accommodation is like because the program itself seems pretty good and I reckon it\u2019s worth travelling across the country (if I get in).\n\nI\u2019ll likely study at the Burwood campus",

            "comment": "hello! i\u2019m currently studying on campus at waurn ponds\n\npros:\n- max 10mins walk to school \n- covered electricity, water and internet bills (basically everything you need) \n- weekly cleaning of common areas\n- events!! (free food, meet friends etc) \n- solid security (you can call them anytime to walk you back esp at night)\n\ncons: (might not apply for burwood/if you have a car)\n- most of the time, the campuses are far from cbd areas and if you are like me, where i wouldn\u2019t travel more than 30mins to shop, it is quite sad \n- expensive (i\u2019m paying close to $1.1k per month when i cld probably go somewhere cheaper)\n- no furnitures, you only get a bed, table and wardrobe/cupboard (you need your own pots and pans, cooking utensils, table lamp, extension cord (i only got like 2 plugs), clock etc) \n\ni personally wld recommend if you have no friends going to school with you and you need to be in school a lot. i have been to school max 10times this tri and i didn\u2019t think it was worth the money. it wld be amazing if you have friends to rent out a place nearby instead!",

I assume the other faculty Academic Integrity units are similar. If you don't pass, I believe you can't progress your course or have to appear before the academic integrity committee or something similar. I can't remember. \n\nBasically, just do it. You get unlimited attempts at the quiz and once it's done, it's done. Its going to be a massive pain in the arse for you to not do it on time and you don't really have many excuses not to because it's the easiest unit in the entire world. Just do it",

In between will be so much correspondence and hassle for so many people that it's just pointless not to click through the test.",

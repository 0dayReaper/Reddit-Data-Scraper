    "postText": "Hello, I'm in the process of figuring out what would go well for Mechatronics engineering. Knowing very little of Australia and it's unis, personal reviews are much appreciated. I want to stay very close to the notion of Mechatronics engineering. You know, every uni has it's own nature and focus. If it's too much of what wouldn't stay real close to Mechatronics, I won't want it. I'm into Robotics, Automation, and Control systems. I'd love a fine blend of them in my program! On a side note, if you are interested to, what and which amongst \nUNSW, RMIT, Deakin, Monash, UofQ and UNSYD for Bachelors of Engineering in Mechatronics would you choose?\nPlease consider less population, course content and warm climate. \n\nAlso, what's the thing amongst semester and trimester? By the way, which of these care about research papers and at least look at the abstracts? Extracurriculars? P.S. I mean to talk about the application process to Deakin guys.",

            "comment": "The trimester system isn't really that different to semesters. Most courses are based on students studying for T1 and T2. T3 classes are optional, but are a good way to reduce the workload of T1 and T2 by spreading the classes across more of the year.\n\nThe mechatronics program uses project based learning, so each trimester you would typically design and build a mechatronics system to complete a set task. As far as I know, the Deakin mechatronics program has more of a focus on completing practical projects than other unis.\n\nI chose Deakin for two reasons -  the first is that I live in Geelong anyway, so it was significantly closer than any other university, and the second is that I was working at the time, and the cloud campus meant that I was able to study at my convenience, instead of attending classes at specific times.\n\nI'm not sure exactly what you're asking in terms of research papers and extracurriculars. If you're asking if you will be expected to read any, then yes, you will. When you do your final year project, your supervising professor may be interested in helping you write a research paper of the results of the project.\n\nThere are a few extracurriculars that you can do as a mechatronics student, like the Warman design and build competition, if that's what you are asking.",

I'm an international applicant eager to get into Deakin for Mechatronics Engineering undergrad. So I'd need a tourist visa that I hope to get whenever I'd be called to arrive there for offline activities. I'm so blown away by this opportunity. And ya, I meant if I can attach my research project report on STEM or at least, it's abstract  and emphasize on my extracurriculars in the application process.",

            "comment": "I did Mechatronics for about 1.5 years before I transferred to doing a Bachelors of Information Technology due to my own reasoning. I will say, it\u2019s a demanding course as all engineering courses are, as the first 2 years will be mathematics focused and you will be thrown in the deep end on your first Trimester in your first year. A lot of dedication is required to do well in Mechatronics and all engineering courses, as that was the case for me to maintain an above 80+ WAM. In terms of what Deakin mainly focuses on, the first year will consist of broad engineering units such as design, computer aided design, programming, physics and mathematics. After that is all done in your first year, then Mechatronics will branch out to your own discipline in areas such as circuitry, analogue and digital systems, robotics and more mathematics. \n\nI didn\u2019t stumble across any research paper based units or curriculum when I did half of the course, however maybe someone who has don\u2019t the full course can elaborate on that further. The semesters for your 4 years of study are pre cut and don\u2019t give you enough room to branch out with electives, as it is only available as a honours sadly. I would suggest reading the Units for Deakin Mechatronics on their advanced Unit Search to check the requirements in terms of assessments and general tasks. I\u2019m not sure if it has changed since I\u2019ve done half of it, but again the \u2018Semesters\u2019 for Mechatronics can be brutal for some parts (for us it\u2019s Trimesters, being 12 weeks maximum and then a 1 week break after week 5)\n\nI think just doing a lot more study on what the course has to offer is a great start, as again Deakin is a bit different compared to other universities that do engineering. You will definitely be required to make some sort of automated system every trimester from your 2nd year up until your 4th and last year, where you will shift on your big major project that will use everything you learnt. I also suggest to get to know people, as it is quite daunting at the beginning for everyone due to how people perceive engineering and the complexity it holds. You\u2019ll be doing the majority of your Units and work from the main Engineering building that Deakin Waurn Ponds offers, as it is fairly equipped with everything you\u2019ll need\n\nAgain, keep exploring your options and if you have any questions, I\u2019m more than happy to answer them in some aspect",

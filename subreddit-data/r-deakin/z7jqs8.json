    "postText": "Heiya!\n\nI am considering on taking the 2yr postgraduate course Masters in Cyber Security \\[Professional\\] and would love to talk to someone who can give me some feedback/experience on the course.\n\nSome of my queries:\n\n    1. does the college provide work placement as well?\n    \n    2. How engaging are the teachers? Is it \"listen and go\" or are there interactions as well?\n    \n    3. How are the classes divided into? \\[lecture, workshop, tutorial\u2026\\] do we have those or something similar where we can discuss the topics that we are taught?\n    \n    4. Are the assignments interesting? Is it group work or individual based?\n    \n    5. Does the course involve practical learning as well? If so what is your review?\n    \n    6. Lastly, what do you think are the strengths and weaknesses of this course?\n\nthanks:)",

Or maybe even Admissions team since you\u2019re still thinking about it. This goes for Q1 and Q6.\n\nFor the lecturers, it all depends. There are okay, good and great lecturers. It all depends really. I assume this is probably the case for almost all universities/schools/educational set up. But almost all of my lecturers are happy to answer / clarify anything during and after the class. So that\u2019s a great plus, I think. And they\u2019re all generally nice. \n\nUnit set-up is usually 3 hours per unit. Some can be broken down to 1.5 class where they teach the theory and then another 1.5 seminar or tutorial where you discuss / apply the theories. There are those though that are just 3 hours straight which is a mix of class and seminar functions.\n\nAssignments can be interesting. It depends on your perspective I guess. It\u2019s mostly application of what you\u2019ve been taught.\n\nNo comment on Q5 since I\u2019m not enrolled in the program you\u2019re eyeing for.\n\nThis is based on my experience. Again, I am not enrolled in the course you\u2019re eyeing but I\u2019d like to believe it\u2019s going to be more or less the same experience for you as well.\n\nFor Q3 and Q4, you can search the handbook, enter your course code and you can have access to the course map where you can view the units you can take up. And they\u2019ll have all the info \u2014 what the set up is for that specific unit, how the assignments go (if individual or group) and other info about the unit. Hope this helps!",

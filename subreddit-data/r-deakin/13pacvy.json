    "postText": "I am considering studying SEM310 as a non-award unit online next semester and wondering if anyone can provide some more information on what the course content involves?\n\nThe unit handbook doesn't really give any details and I've had no response from the unit chair. It seems to be a 3rd year unit but the course guide mentions introductory content so just wondering if anyone can shed some more light!\n\nTIA",

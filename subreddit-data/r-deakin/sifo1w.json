I originally enrolled at Waurn Ponds (moved online during Covid) but many of my lecturers have been from Burwood. Many are very accomplished in their field, I even attended a book launch by one of them which was a helpful insight to that world.",

I imagine you could say the same of anywhere though. You're better off choosing a uni that has the majors you want to study, and is a reasonable distance on PT to your house. Deakin was on the opposite side of the city to my house so I regretted the travel, but if you live in the Eastern suburbs you'll be fine.",

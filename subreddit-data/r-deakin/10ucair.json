    "postText": "hi everyone! if anyone has undertaken these electives or could give me any advice it would be greatly appreciated - btw i'm starting first year in 2023. i have one last elective spot to fill in T1, but am not sure whether i should choose cells + genes (SLE111) or understanding families and health (HSH105).\n\nregarding bio, i've never taken it before and have never really been that interested in it. however, i do want to take biochem (SLE212) in year 2. biochem has chem as a pre-requisite, (which i am taking anyway) and recommends study of bio.\n\non the other hand, understanding families and health lists the unit understanding health (HBS107) as desirable to be taking or have taken it - basically they strongly recommend to do HBS107 to get the most out of HSH105.\n\nso i'm not sure if i should take bio to make my life a bit easier during year 2 in biochem, or take understanding families and health and try something different. thank you if you've read all of this, and a bigger ty if you have any advice.",

I also had never studied bio before and tried to do a bio subject without having done C&amp;G and it was too hard (I had to drop) because the pace and info in bio subjects is fast and busy and you really need a leg up with an introductory bio unit at a university level. \nI did Understanding Health and found the content and assessments to be really basic, esp if you\u2019re leaning towards biochem. \n\nAs a side note, as someone who\u2019s just been through 3 years of mostly online learning, if you see a unit with practicals and mostly on campus learning (such as C&amp;G) snap that shit up, you will get so so so much more out of it.",

The content and assessment tasks are comprehensive and the unit chair is very engaging. Overall it gave me a really good insight into public health units/study in general.",

I have been thinking of doing the double degree of law and science at deakin university and have a few questions I would like answers to. I would really appreciated if you can help me out, thank you so much!\n\n1. What's it's like studying at Deakin law? (the content, how the course lays out,trimester system, etc)\n2. What's your schedule like? (e.g. how often do you have to go on campuses)\n3. Should i worry about the employment issues after graduating, I'm hoping to become a lawyer after graduating (specifically, in family/health law)\n\n* i heard it's really hard/competitive to get a job in the top-tier/upper mid-tier firm\n* by being at deakin uni, compare to monash and melbourne uni students, will i be at a disadvantage when looking for a job?\n\nLastly, If you graduated from deakin law, what are you doing now?\n\nThank you once again for taking your time to answers my questions!",

            "comment": "Hi friend, congrats on finishing year 12. I don't have the exact perspective you're looking for but can offer up a bit of information. I studied Law/Arts at Monash for two years, and am now in my second year of Nursing at Deakin Burwood. My perspective is of course limited and only my own but I can share with you what I know. Hope the following information helps.  \n\n\nTrimesters - This confused me at first, coming from Monash, but it's clearer than you might think and has some advantages. Basically the Main Trimesters and Trimester 1 and 2, which are very similar to Semester 1 and 2 in other Unis. Most universities have subjects that you can take over the summer, but these are usually taken very intensively over a shorter period. Deakin has instead created a 3rd Trimester for these summer subjects, so that they do not have to be undertaken so intensively. Trimester 3 is often used for electives or occaisionally catching up on subjects you might have missed for some reason - and often interesting opportunities like internships, research subjects and study tours are available at this time. But generally speaking, you don't need to do subjects in Trimester 3 usually unless you would like to. For those of us that don't study in Trimester 3, this means that we get a really long break over the summer - several weeks longer than our counterparts at other universities. It's a really good time to recuperate and reset between your academic years. This does mean a shorter break in the middle of the year, but you will still get a few weeks off. I prefer it to the Semester model, but that's only personal opinion.  \n\n\nBurwood Campus - It's a nice, modern campus with some nice walking trails running through it. The Law building is quite new and there's a lot of places indoors and outdoors around campus to study and hang out. It's pretty easy to navigate after a couple of weeks too. There's good coffee places on campus, but there aren't really any shops and not heaps of food options. There's not heaps surrounding the uni in this regard unless you get on the tram to Burwood or take the bus to Box Hill. That's my main grievance with the campus, everything else is quite good and compares well with my experience at Monash.\n\nContent - All accredited law degrees in Australia have to incorporate the Priestley 11: 11 compulsory subjects in a range of legal subjects (including Criminal Law, Torts, Contracts, Evidence and others). So to some extent, most of your compulsory subjects in Law will be quite similar across different Unis. As an area of study, it is incredibly skills-based and requires a lot of critical thinking. There is a lot of content, but when I started my law degree, I thought it would be much more centred around knowledge - I was very wrong. It is fast-paced, and you will not feel on top of things even if you have good grades (I did quite well in law and still always felt on the back foot). I found it very interesting and engaging, and I really enjoyed the learning, but if you are a perfectionist (as many folks who get the ATAR to get into Law are), you're gonna have to adjust your thinking and just trust that things will click in time. I will also say that you will have less support than you might expect at University - you will spend most of your time teaching yourself things, and then just getting clarification and enrichment in your classes. Starting Uni, I was quite taken aback by this at first and it took some getting used to, but it's empowering once you settle in. But good to consider in light of the other stuff I've said.  \n\n\nSchedules - At uni a vast majority of what you learn will come from private study outside of class. For science subjects, you might have a lecture, a tutorial and a practical to go to. Pracs might run fortnightly and the other classes weekly, although this will all depend on the discipline and the subject. For law, You might have two classes per week, often a couple of hours in length. But if you timetable carefully, you can get away with only going like 2-3 days per week. Nursing is a quite classroom-heavy degree and I usually only do two 4-6hour days per week during the trimester.  \n\n\nDeakin vs Monash - Monash is the more prestigious law school overall, but that does not indicate the quality of the teaching. Deakin is quite well regarded too from what I have heard, particularly in commercial law. Speaking about the universities more broadly though, Deakin is much better for students in my opinion. Monash's unit sites were highly disorganised and lacked a common template, unit information was often not very clearly relayed, and exam timetables would come out with not heaps of notice. Deakin does much better than all of this. These are the direct examples I can give, but it's reflective of different vibes overall. Monash think of themselves very highly, and as a result expect students to bend over backwards to fit whatever works for the institution. Deakin however, although imperfect, at least tries to make things clear, accessible and supportive for students.  \n\n\nEmployment after graduation - This is a very interesting one, and a really big factor in why I transferred out of law school. I'll cover this one in a few sub points. Tl;dr, it's pretty rough:  \n\n\n* There is a massive oversupply of Law graduates. Nearly all universities offer Law in Australia now, and there are much more law graduates than there are law jobs. This means that if you want to do law because you want to be a lawyer, you will have to work very hard inside and outside of the classroom (particularly if you do not currently work in or have connections in the law). People drive themselves to burnout trying to keep up with networking events, cold calling firms to get experience, internships and extracurriculars just to try to get those graduate jobs as lawyers. I know of people who got good grades at Monash Law, did extracurriculars and took on a lot of professional development opportunities who could only get paralegal jobs after graduating. It can be difficult to get a graduate position at any tier of law firm, and that only becomes more competitive if the area you want to practice in is not very large.\n* I've implied it already, but increasingly law firms are looking at people holistically rather than just the university they went to. You might be at a disadvantage at some of the law schools that are newer or easier to get into, but I don't think you would be looked on poorly as a Deakin graduate. They will be looking at your work experience, grades, professional development opportunities, referees and extracurriculars and judging pretty holistically on it all.  I wouldn't rule out going to Deakin out of a worry about prestige - it's still quite well regarded.\n* Even if you get a grad job as a Lawyer, the conditions can be pretty rough as a junior lawyer. Unpaid overtime is a very common expectation, and the graduate salary of lawyers is only about $50-60k. This salary increases with experience and career progression, but it's not a great place to start. Nurses get a similar graduate salary, but I would rather be working 30 hours per week for it than 50.\n* The areas of the Law you are interested in are usually not the ones where the jobs are. For myself, I wanted to work in Family Violence Law and other social justice causes, and a lot of law students are driven by a similar sense of justice. But the largest amount of legal work out there (and therefore the greatest amount of jobs) is in commercial and corporate law. If you are flexible about the kind of area you could practice in (and who you could be representing), then this could be an okay fallback. But it wasn't for me. Even if you want to work in criminal law, it is very competitive and only a smallish slice of the legal industry - only about 10% of Victorian Supreme Court cases are for crime. I went to law school because I wanted to fight for justice and empower people who lacked means for representation, and at the end of the day I could not find a way to make that dream a reality without totally burning out and wrecking myself in the process. I wanted to make a difference, but I couldn't find a way to do so in law. I'm now in nursing and much happier for it.\n* Worrying about a graduate job will take a lot out of you. I used to lose sleep at night because I would lie awake trying to figure out how I could make my career work, and how I could make sure I got a job at the end of my degree. Since transferring into Nursing, it hasn't occupied my mind at all. I think about what I could do and the sort of job I might want, rather than trying to contort my life for any job in law. You can still make it in law if you are really driven and willing to make it your life for a good while, and I have mad respect for those that do, but I needed better work-life balance for myself both at uni and after graduation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps!

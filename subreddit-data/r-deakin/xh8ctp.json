    "postText": "Hi everyone,\nI'm planning to do  the master in AI. Any advice on what I need to touch up on before starting? \nI'm already looking at python tutorials (I worked with Java in my Bachelor's degree) and machine learning stuff. I have heard of SciKit Learn, Tensorflow etc. I don't know where to start.\n\nThanks in advance.",

That will include linear algebra, probability and multivariate calculus. There will likely be other subjects that require some statistics and optimisation.\n\nIf you do the tutorial projects in Kaggle, using python in jupyter notebook, it will probably be a good start.",

            "comment": "In my experience, the courses will give you all the introduction you need to know. Although BA AI is around these days, it really wasn't when most people starting a Masters would have completed their BA, so the level of prerequisite knowledge about AI is not high.\n\nThat said, u/Art_Soul is on the money with the actual core content. But I would not worry about stressing out about learning things before hand, because they'll hold your hand the whole way through.\n\nIf I could go back and have stronger skills in any particular area before beginning my Masters, it would be basic computer skills. Rebuilding my PC and understanding its components (and upgrading!), understanding how a GPU works and how to operate it, understanding how to use the command line, program versions, memory issues etc. That said, I don't have a CS background so my skills in this area were particularly weak. If you are CS background or the kind of person who would willingly use linux, ensuring you understand basic math (specifically derivatives) is probably a better bet.",

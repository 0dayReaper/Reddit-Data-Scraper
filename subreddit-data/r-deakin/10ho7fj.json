    "postText": "Hey all! \nI just handed in an assignment and completely forgot to include the reference list. I handed in another version with the list, I just want to double check whether they would mark that or the first version with no reference list? I recall a tutor saying they only mark the most recent submission, is that still true? Also does handing in the two versions a day late affect that in any way? (Only check the first version bc it\u2019s a day late)\n\nSorry if this makes no sense, panicking a bit but TIA!!",

If they were both submitted on the same day (so are on time or equally late) then I'd expect the last version to be the one that is marked, but if one would incur a larger late penalty, then it depends on the Unit Chair or marker. Either way, worth clarifying - and in this case, I'd take an extra day of late penalty over no references.",

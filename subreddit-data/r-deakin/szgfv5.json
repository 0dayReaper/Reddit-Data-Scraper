Obligatory \u201cI am not a lawyer\u201d, but [I quickly calculated your award rates](https://calculate.fairwork.gov.au/CheckPay/Summary) and based on that, you should be getting paid up to 28.08 on weekdays, $33.31 on Saturdays and $39.31 on Sunday. $56.15 on public holidays. \n\nThat is assuming you haven\u2019t signed an agreement otherwise with your employer. You\u2019d better check the fair work site to find out\n\nETA: YMMV based on what you actually do as waitstaff (eg if you handle money, greet guests, serve liquor, have had training, etc)",

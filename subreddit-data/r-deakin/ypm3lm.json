I\u2019m currently studying the JD (for which I have a CSP).\n\nI\u2019ve also just been accepted into a masters at another uni (No CSP, but I have advanced standing, so I can complete it in 1 year, rather than 1.5). \n\nI was considering taking the masters, but wanted to know if I could be enrolled at two unis at the same time for two different degrees. Monash have said I can take a break from the JD, but would I still get to keep my CSP if I went to study at another institution for a year?",

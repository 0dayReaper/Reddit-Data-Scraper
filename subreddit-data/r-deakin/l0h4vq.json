    "postText": "Hello. I\u2019m an International student(Malaysia), almost done with my Year 2. I\u2019m currently out of the country and it honestly feels like I\u2019m at the edge. Online classes have been so hard to follow, especially when I\u2019m back here with family. I wish to be alone, so I can focus solely on my studies but the current situation doesn\u2019t permit me to do so. My mental health is going down the drain and my grades/WAM has dropped ever-since I moved back here. It wasn\u2019t something I wanted, but had to do, due to our terrible financial situation. I\u2019m feeling helpless and my anxiety is skyrocketing when I think about how this messed up situation has affected my studies, which will affect me later on, even when I\u2019m looking for jobs. This is a mess and I am exhausted. \n\nIs there any way someone could tell me when the borders would be open for International students, or at least, help me figure out a way to cope? I\u2019m sorry this is such a long read. :( I feel lost. Any advice/idea/help would be very appreciated.\n\nMany thanks. \nPs: I hope you\u2019re all doing fine, wherever you are.",

Unfortunately we won't realistically have the opportunity to return to Melbourne in the first half of this year or even this year at all.\n\nHowever, there has been chatter from the Vic gov about potentially setting up pathways for international students to return. If you'd like there's actually a group for Malaysian students such as yourself where updates are shared and advice/support is given to one another in regards to returning to Australia. Drop me a PM if you'd like to be added. Stay sane and stay healthy friend!",

I'm fortunate enough to have a peaceful study/work environment at home, I can't even imagine OPs struggles with all non-essential places like libraries and cafes closed in the current hard lockdown :(",

I've been staying away from news lately...\n\nI am so sorry, that was a difficult time in Melbourne so my thoughts go out to you during this tough time. Look after yourself and remember that this is unprecedented times and a lower WAM is not reflective on your abilities &lt;3\n\nHave you considered getting in contact with Deakin DLU, as you mentioned it is impacting your mental health and they can help. They may be able to provide support with extensions and there are also psychologists at Deakin which you can do video chat with.\n\nAside from that, getting a set of headphones and listening to Chilled Cow study music really helps me to relax and block out the world. Personally I study late because daytime has too much going on.\n\nI hope that things improve for you x",

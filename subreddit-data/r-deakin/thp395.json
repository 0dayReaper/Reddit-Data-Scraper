    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI wanted to ask someone if they could help me out with my course. I'm a biomedical science transfer student and I wanted information on 2nd year units, I wanted insight on what the practicals cover and how are they conducted. I have ADHD, so practicals most of the time  leave me paranoid or anxious, did I miss something or am I doing it wrong. Last thing was, I wanted information on  the unit guides for  some units.\n\nIf anyone can help me out you're welcome to  msg privately or just comment below.\n\nThank you.",

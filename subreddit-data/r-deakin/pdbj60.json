You can reach me either by:\ncommenting here, or messaging me on reddit.\n\nIf you play chess at all (no matter at what level) or are interested in learning, then you might be interested in joining! \nSome of the club's activities would be:  \n- Meeting and playing with other chess players  \n- Online Chess nights\n- Pizza and Chess nights (when Lockdown ends?)\n - Chess competitions with prizes  \n- Group Chess lessons \n- (Potentially chess mentoring?!) \n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask \ud83d\ude04",

They\u2019ll need to see what the official letter you receive, if any, says to walk you through what the next steps are.\n\nCheck regularly for the letter once results are released and if it tells you that you that the decision has been made to exclude you (as opposed to just a warning) then call DUSA straightaway to book in for one of their sessions.\n\nIf you do need to appeal a decision you will need to write a letter outlining why you were unsuccessful previously and what steps you are now taking to ensure that you will be successful in the future.\n\nDUSA will walk you through this, give you suggestions of self-help tools available at the university (and maybe externally too) and a recommended structure for the letter. If you give them enough time they can review any drafts you put together and recommend ways to strengthen your argument.\n\nI recommend spending this time thinking about what you will put in this letter and what you intend to do going forwards to pass all of your units.\n\nFor example, if you were struggling with anxiety or depression that affected your study, have you sought medical support and put ongoing support in place to keep that under control? Have you booked an appointment with Deakin Counselling? Would your doctor or counsellor be willing to write a letter to submit as evidence affirming what you were going through at the time?\n\nHave you checked to see if the unit you struggled with has a PASS group set-up? If so, make plans to join it next time and state so in your appeal letter https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/studying/study-support/peer-learning/pass\n\nIf you struggled with time management you can put together a weekly planner with a healthy balance of study, recreation and rest and submit the planner with your appeal. Remember planning to do nothing but study is unsustainable and will burn you out, the university will want to see that you have fun and study and downtime in the right moderation: https://www.deakin.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/440601/Trimester-and-Weekly-Planners.pdf",

As an International Student they might need to see your private healthcare info such as BUPA though.\n\nWorking your way back to positive mental health is a bit of a journey, I\u2019ve been seeing a therapist since January. But there is help out there - I wish you all the best!",

    "postText": "HELLO! Looking for peoples experiences doing a Graduate Certificate of Counselling following a BA Social Work. \n\nI\u2019m looking at doing a Grad Cert of counselling soon through Deakin online, or University of Southern Queensland online and want to hear about others experiences. \n\nYes, I know I can do counselling with a BA Social Work but I want the additional theoretical knowledge and the added confidence. \n\nI want to know if people learned more than they learned in their social work degree - i.e. do you learn specific therapeutic approaches more in-depth, as opposed to basic micro counselling skills etc? \nUSQ seem to have a few different types of Grad Cert of counselling courses (each specialising in a different area - mental health, child and adolescent, alcohol &amp; other drugs, and foundations of practice) which seems pretty cool. \n\nI don\u2019t want to commit to a masters or a grad diploma just yet (more placement hours? No thanks!). \n\nOr if you know anyone who has done this I\u2019d love to hear what they thought!",

Both are fully accredited and the MCouns will aaard you admission to the ACA after graduation. To the best of my knowledge Deakin isn\u2019t approved yet and for only 4 more papers you could have a masters and a certain accreditation. I\u2019d check out the Monash MCouns and then use the Ba in social work to knock 6 months to a year off it. See their entry reqs as to how much you can knock off it.",

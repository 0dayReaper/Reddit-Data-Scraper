The way they are structured means you can either focus more on technical aspects, or on the project management aspects, or both.\n\nSo if you want to code you can usually do that almost exclusively.\n\nEDIT: Languages can vary but the ones I came across were mostly web apps so mostly basic scripting languages, stylesheets and PHP.",

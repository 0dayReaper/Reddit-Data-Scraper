They send you an e-mail after the results are released giving all the details + a form to accept the conditons. \nAlso you\u2019ve got T3 coming up so you can compensate then and finish your degree within the timeframe youve planned for.",

Tho all the assignments I\u2019ve done at Deakin werent hurdle requirements so failing an assignment doesnt result in an overall fail; rather they count the overall marks achieved throughout all the assignments together. If you got 50% (across all assignments) then you pass. Might wanna count your overall mark in those units + check if those assignments are hurdles. \nYes you\u2019re able to retake the units whether they\u2019re core units or electives, its just that the university will give you enrolment conditions (at least thats what I got). \nAll the best",

Visit a counsellor and discuss any personal issues you\u2019re having, the counselling service at Deakin are a plenty of help for depression and anxiety symptoms. And talk to a learning advisor to figure out what suits you most and to come up with a course map if you havent already. Most units at Deakin are taught over specific trimesters so if you failed a core unit you might have to take it at the period that it\u2019s taught next (all this info is provided on the deakin handbook just search the unit code). For now, just move on to the next core unit you need to complete. As for elective units you dont have to take the same ones (unless you want to), so you can choose whatever\u2019s available in T3 which also interests you. \nI reckon as a first step visit a learning advisor and they\u2019ll show you how and when you can retake those units (if you actually fail them).\nThe gist of it tho is that you\u2019ll be alright, and you\u2019ll be able to complete your degree",

In my case they said I could only enrol in 2 units in the next trimester and I had to pass both of them. I was struggling motivating myself at the time so I can understand the struggle, but it was the kick I needed and probably the kick you\u2019ll need to get your studying on the right track.

As mentioned above by another commenter, if you do fail your units, you will likely be contacted by some relevant department from enrolment at Deakin and they\u2019ll put you on academic probation where you can only take 2 units per trimester. You\u2019ll need to re-enrol in the units you failed and do them again, and you will have to pay again for the units too. Hopefully with only 2 classes at a time you can better manage to keep up with your studies. If I were you I would call up Student Connect or whomever and ask these questions there.

    "postText": "I had initially planned to take deakin res but they said they are reaching maximum capacity and to look for other options. I have been seeing houses on houseme but how do I find a legit place. Some of the listings don\u2019t have proper photos etc and because I don\u2019t know anyone in Melbourne I can\u2019t visit the place physically to see what its like. Another concern in the type of people living there, I wanted to take res because I thought it would be easier to socialise and make some friends as an international student who knows no one. As an international student who doesn\u2019t know anyone in Melbourne, how should I go about this? Should I book a hotel or something for my initial week and then try to find a place by visiting the houses myself? Is there any other alternative student accommodation to res that is near the campus? Please give me some advice as to how I should approach this \ud83e\udd72",

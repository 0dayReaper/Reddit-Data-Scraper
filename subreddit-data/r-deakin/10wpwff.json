Deakin don't send much snail mail, but when they do you won't always know it's coming.\n\nEchoing another comment, if you are having difficulties at home, please be aware there are free and confidential support services available at Deakin. They can assist you with things like Centrelink, finding housing if it would be safer for you to move out, finding work, food banks, etc.",

It was mailed in a nondescript, white envelope with some discreet Deakin branding. I didn't know it was from Deakin until I opened it and ripped my card out (thanks for using my skinny pictures Deakin \ud83e\udd70).  If your parents are super duper mail snoopers, they might notice, in which case, just tell them it was sent in error to try and get more students or something \ud83d\ude05\n\n**If you need to hide your study from your parents for a while,** I'd suggest changing your Deakin postal address while you're studying. Are your folks listed as emergency contacts? \n\nIf a PO Box isn't in the budget rn, do you have a trusted friend or relative who understands and supports your decision to study that might let you use their address as your postal?",

When we first started dating,  I was appalled to hear that had to hide most of his life from his folks - *while living under their roof.* \n\nNot understanding the situation fully, I encouraged him to tell them about me. I'm a safety nerd who couldn't imagine going on a holiday without people knowing, him included. So he told them. What followed was the cyclone of screaming, name-calling, and empty death threats that come with defying parents like that. \n\nAfter that whole thing, and seeing how much pain it caused my ex, I was more on board with the necessary fibs and sneaking about.",

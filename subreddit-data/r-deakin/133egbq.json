            "comment": "Living on res will probably accelerate your social life in that you have more forced interactions and you\u2019re living in closer proximity. If you can afford it, do it! \n\nIt is pretty hard to make friends the older you get, though, and uni is no different. I think with covid as a disruptor people overall have lost little social skills that made making friends a little harder too- just little things like following up from interactions (\u201chey it was great to meet you today, here\u2019s my number\u201d), or not overcompensating for the virtual experience (eg. Lots of zoom classes might be cams off, but people don\u2019t put the effort into then using the chat). This is not a diss on anyone, just something I\u2019ve noticed that seems to be almost universal. At the start of COVID we were all a little more conscious to overcompensate for the social barriers, but now at uni people feel a little awkward about interacting or don\u2019t jump into an interaction with the same effort. Not sure why this is - something to ask a social studies student maybe! \n\nMy best advice is that uni life is what you make it, and this has always been true. If you want to make friends, you will. If you leave it up to chance, you probably won\u2019t. \n\nJoin clubs and societies - but don\u2019t just join - be active in the club. Go to meet ups, ask to be a part of planning events and make an effort to get to know people. Trust me - the club organisers are pulling their hair out trying to get engagement and get this thing off the ground and it\u2019s one of the hardest things to build a vibe when almost everyone is hanging back waiting for magic to happen before they dip their toes in. They will love you for brining energy and making effort. You don\u2019t even need to bring heaps of energy - just a bit! Introduce yourself, say hi, rock up, that\u2019s it! \n\nSpeak up in class. If there\u2019s an open forum, just challenge yourself to say one thing in class each time you\u2019re there, even if it\u2019s outside your comfort zone. You won\u2019t know it, but you\u2019ll be silently encouraging others to feel confident to do it too, and people will remember you and maybe even feel comfortable enough to talk to you as well outside of class (and in class). \n\nActually rock up. This is basically most of it. Just get yourself up, go to class, and make the most of it. You\u2019re paying an extraordinary amount of money to be there, you may as well make a job out of it. Even if there\u2019s only 3 people in a lecture, just go. They might not be your forever friends but they will be a uni friend and I can tell you right now, those people are like gold in the future. So many of my uni friends are now colleagues or acquaintances in my network and I do not regret the times hanging out on campus one single bit, even if I knew some of these people weren\u2019t going to be forever friends. We had some good times! \n\n Follow up on interactions!! This is so important. If you liked talking to someone, send them an email (if you know someone\u2019s name you can find them in the email directory using your deakin email) or better yet, in the moment ask to follow them on IG or give them your number in case they ever want to get a coffee on campus or study together again. This sounds scary but it gets easier. If they don\u2019t reciprocate, no big deal. But a lot of the time you have to be in the driving seat of making friends especially in this day and age where people kind of need an extra push. I might be old now (been at uni for 10+ years now) so maybe people don\u2019t swap numbers anymore but the principle still stands. If you like someone just follow up with them with a simple \u201chey! It was great to meet you, I\u2019m on campus every Monday if you wanna hang again let me know\u201d. Just make it easy for the other person. Don\u2019t be creepy or rude if they never get back to you, but don\u2019t be discouraged either. Just let it go and move on to the next person. \n\nThere\u2019s tonnes of extra stuff you can do on campus that doesn\u2019t seem like socialising, but it is. Volunteering (peer mentoring, join a volunteer group on a different topic), study groups like PASS, get a job on campus (eg become a writing mentor or something if you\u2019re a smarty pants and have that gift to give), or join an extra curricular workshop or event (careers events are amazing for this!!). You\u2019ll be in a room full of people who have also gotten up off their ass to do something extra and you\u2019ll probably find it 100000x easier to interact with these people and make friends - they\u2019re up for it. You might also learn some new skills - resume writing, presentation skills, library tours, career talks, etc. it\u2019s all good stuff! \n\nConsider joining the philosophy club. Just an idea. It\u2019s a club centred around having discussions with people. You don\u2019t need to be studying philosophy to do it. I\u2019m pretty sure they also meet at the pub sometimes (IIRC) and that is a great social lubricator if you are that way inclined. The networking and entrepreneurial society also seemed to have some great events and be focused on engagement last time I checked. \n\nThere\u2019s tonnes here, I could probably keep writing forever but my tea is now getting cold. If you\u2019ve read this far - kudos to you and I hope you got something out of it! Even if it\u2019s one thing that resonated and you ditch the rest, that\u2019s awesome. Making friends takes effort and doesn\u2019t come easy to most of us but good job making it this far and putting some thought and effort into it. If you ever learn the magic formula or have tips to share please come back and help the rest of us out - I feel that this is a pretty commonly asked question and something we\u2019ve all had to work on at some stage or another and I\u2019m constantly learning myself. Don\u2019t be a stranger! Good luck!",

                    "comment": "Well first off that was a lot but yes I did read the whole thing :D\n\nYour advice feels pretty spot on, I'm 22 now and will be 23 when I start my second undergrad which is concerning because I imagine most undergrads are going to be like 19 (based on prior experience). I think it's getting people to add me on stuff like insta that I struggle with, it just feels so strange to do it and admittedly I probably seem pretty awkward when I do ask.\n\nI'll likely be volunteering or similar at Deakin, I've been volunteering for the past 9 years in various things and was a Club leader at Swinburne and a Peer-mentor for my last semester which was definitely the most social time I had at uni. I think it's difficult because a lot of people don't really give off the vibe that they actually want to be interacted with, I've definitely gotten better at starting conversations in probably the last 6 months. I'm actually very new to the Geelong region as I moved here in the new year from Melbourne and regional victoria before that.\n\nHonestly, the main stuff I probably struggle with is approaching and networking. Most people take a liking to me once they actually talk to me, I just suck at initiating...I've been a bartender for lil now though which definitely helps that skillset and I've learnt social norms as well as how to compliment people in a way that is genuine and not creepy (I'm pretty behind in my social skills due to ADHD and ASD as well as a lack of exposure).\n\nI appreciate your long response so I've attempted to return the effort :)",

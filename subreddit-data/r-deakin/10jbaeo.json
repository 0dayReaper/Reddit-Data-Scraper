So that was a frustrating piece of information that would have benefited from being on the course site.\n\nI did my degree with a 13\" laptop, which was good for going on site, and used a travel dock and monitor to give me a bit of screen space when at home. I couldn't imagine trying to write anything substantial on an iPad.",

If they want to be as sure as possible, they could check with a course advisor, otherwise making sure the basic requirements are covered is a good starting point.\n\nCompletely agree about not writing anything lengthy on an iPad. I was wondering whether an iPad pro with keyboard could work, but then it becomes a bit of a moot point as it becomes very similar to a laptop in physical function. Also definitely agree about an extra monitor being useful, especially if one doesn't want to print out readings and other materials while preparing assignments, etc.",

Has anyone else received an offer through a direct application and what was your WAM?\n\nI\u2019m quite anxious that I won\u2019t receive an offer (my current WAM is 79).",

Good luck!",

I'm thinking of giving the uni a few days and then giving a polite call/email to enquire. Let me know if you hear any news too yeh?\n\nAlso a bit of spice - the website just updated the atar from 95.5 to 96.7 minimum for the school leavers so they have given some early offers to VTAC applicants too.",

My friend contacted the student advisor and they advised her to send the admissions team an email regarding an update! So she'll hear an update in 5 days apparently. \n\nOmg, I did not notice that they updated the atar requirement until now!                I've honestly been overthinking these past few weeks about my application and this is making it worse. :(",

Try to relax if you can and don't bite your nails off.\n\nDisclaimer: Im not an optometry student but have been around the block before",

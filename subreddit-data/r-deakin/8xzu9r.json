    "postText": "Hi all,  \n\n\nI'm putting together a Discord group for Deakin Engineering students &amp; graduates to chat about our coursework, network and socialise. So far there's 15 of us ranging from 1st Year to Graduates, both off and on-campus and there's a place to discuss *every* undergraduate Engineering unit Deakin offers currently.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/NugKM7f is the link if you're interested. \n\n\nAll welcome.  \n\n\nCheers,  \nJames Moffat",

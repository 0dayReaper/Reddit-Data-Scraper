Would it be difficult for me to get through the course? I've been generally good with maths just that is didn't do it for my Alevels and I've lost practice.\n\nWhat should I be focusing on now inorder to get through the mathematics modules? Can I learn it online from Khan academy? If so which areas should I focus on?",

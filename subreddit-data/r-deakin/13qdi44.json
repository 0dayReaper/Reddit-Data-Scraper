Everyone was so incredibly generous and helpful, I managed to find someone but my heart is very full with knowing how nice some strangers can be :')",

Is it 7.4D, 7.2C, 6.3D, 9.4D or another one? I\u2019ve finished all of them and could help subject to the Academic integrity requirements.",

Splashkit is just a annoying library to use which is why no other universities use it. \n\nAlso do you mean you are doing the July 2023 intake or February/March intake in 2024?",

You could contact student central I think (not 100% sure though)\n\nFor more information you could check out the course handbook here:\nhttps://www.deakin.edu.au/students/enrolment-and-fees/manage-your-course/handbooks/2023-handbook\n\nIt won\u2019t give you specifics on what we do exactly as that depends on unit. From what I understand, C# &amp; Python are used a lot.\n\nAlthough if you wanted to better prepare, I\u2019d recommend picking up software architect, design patterns and programming paradigms.",

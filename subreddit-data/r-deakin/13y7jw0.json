    "postText": "Looked into the \"Master of Engineering (Professional)\" or \"Master of Engineering (Research)\" in 2024. Deakin Additive Manufacturing Lab is what made me interested in the forst place. But i checked the accredited course list in the Engineers Australia website and deakin masters are not listed in the document (Link added below).\n\nIt also says \"next general review 2023\". Is there a chance the masters programs be accredited from 2024?",

The Masters programs are not mentioned in the pdf. according to the website, this pdf has all the accredited courses. but there is a line where it says \"Next review in 2023\". I want to know if there is a chance the masters programs will be added to the accredited list after the review.",

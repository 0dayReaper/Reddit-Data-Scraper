I do not live on campus, but from what I hear the on campus accommodations are quite nice and close to everything. The advice I will give you though is once you arrive and get settled in, go to the train station and pick up a myki card. It'll give you access to all the public transportation services and it's cheap as chips. The card itself costs $6 and they do not accept international credit cards. I hope you have a good time here!",

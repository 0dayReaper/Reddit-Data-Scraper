    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI'm up in QLD and I'm trying to get a hold of the data tables from the 1996 census. My libraries can't arrange a copy or loan from another library, the ABS no longer sells the CD product, and doesn't release the data digitally.\n\nDeakin university library however does have it. \n\nWould someone be willing to pop into the library, copy the CDs onto a USB, and upload the data to me?\n\nIt would be massively appreciated if you could help out!\n\nEDIT: This has been completed. Thank you to those that helped with this, much appreciated!",

    "postText": "I\u2019ll be joining in July (trimester 2) for a bachelor\u2019s degree but i had read on the website that typically students undertake only two and not three trimesters a year? Would that mean that i would complete trimester 2 and 3 this year then skip trimester 1 next year? \n\nIs there any advantage/disadvantage to doing so and what to students typically do?\n\nthanks !",

Usually students undertake elective units in T3 to accelerate their timeline (it\u2019s also a great time to complete an internship), or take T3 off. You may find some units run across all trimesters, but be careful of how you do stack your course map if you\u2019re needing to rely on Centrelink for full time study status. Talk to a student advisor to plan your course and get a course map.",

There's such a huge break between tri 2 and tri 1 the following year I'd fully recommend doing one subject over tri 3 to lighten your load during the main year. I've had subjects that are electives that only run over tri 3 so check your course guide",

My only concern in thinking T3 would be amazing, is the availability of the units of, say, T1 of 2nd year in Mechatronics engineering. Simply put, translating the units back and staying ahead ?! I'd reach out to the student advisors anyway, but hey, I'd love to hear from y'all !",

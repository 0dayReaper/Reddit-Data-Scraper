He's quite a few weeks behind, and doesn't feel like he can catch up. I know he will need to talk to Deakin about this next week, but in the meantime, just wondering if anyone here can share their experience/advice with this sort of thing. \n\nAlso, if anybody was on student income from centrelink and either failed or suspended study, I'd be keen to know if/how it was affected!\n\nThanks",

A fail shows up on your transcript as a fail and it will also bring down your WAM (if that is a concern). \n\nWithdrawing Late means you pay for the unit but it doesn't count as a fail.\n\nThe Centrelink issue is a bigger one. You need to maintain at least 3 CP enrollment to qualify as a student. But the over-arching question is whether amassing a debt in failed units is worth the income support in the longer term. If your partner fails a trimester due to his underlying condition, he will have to go through a progress review and possible restriction on how many CP he can enrol in next time. The outcome very much depends on the faculty and the track record of your partner. But if he is getting diagnosed and new medication to address the issue, then most faculties will be pretty charitable about that as a potential good sign for the future. Generally faculties will allow you to maintain the 3 CP enrollment for Centrelink purposes, but not year after year.",

Are you saying some faculties try to force you to do 4? Or have I misunderstood? 3 in an ongoing fashion might be an issue for allowable time rules with Centrelink, but I have never had any issue with it at the university level.\n\nI've done anywhere from 2 to 4 depending what suits me each trimester, most often 3, including 3 trimesters in a row where I did 3 units. I've never had to give a reason why I was doing less than 4, and I've never had to declare a change between full-time and part time (2 being part-time). I literally just enrol in however many units I see fit. And this was before I had an Access Plan.",

I wasn't very exact.\n\nI mean in cases where someone is failing units on a regular basis, most students would be compelled to only enrol in 2 or 1 CP  for a bit. BUT if you have a Centrelink situation, faculties might still allow you to enrol in 3 so as to maintain your payments. However, that won't last forever. If you keep enrolling and keep failing, eventually they will step in.",

There's generally less available, but it would allow him to catch up on some units. The DRC adjustments still apply. \n\nAlso, when you get a formal diagnosis, you may be able to apply for a retroactive course fee refund if you consult DUSA. He will probably need to become a member to get their help, but the lowest cost membership is pretty cheap.",

            "comment": "No comment on Centrelink but for transcript and WAM purposes, 100% suspending a trimester is better. Much better to explain to a future employer that you proactively took time off to deal with a health matter, than to be explaining a string of fails that way, or to not even get in the door because the fails dragged your WAM down.\n\nAlso, a lot of fails can lead to things like academic probation and possibly exclusion. \n\nAt this point in the trimester, we are post-census date so they will still pay for the units and they will be shown on their transcript as WL (Withdrawn Late) but that the 0 grades do not count towards heir WAM. \n\nAlso, if they do get ADHD confirmed, or it's another condition, please make sure they know they can get assistance from the Disability Resource Centre. I was diagnosed with ADHD myself last year and now have an Access Plan that provides me with all sorts of helpers, some of which I wouldn't have even thought to ask for. The initial appointment went for just over an hour and they asked heaps of questions about adjustments that might help and included anything that might, so I have a lot of options that I can use (or not use) as needed.",

Another person just said that at Monash fails aren't marked on transcripts this semester because of covid, so if that is true for deakin he might let the fail happen, just for centrelink reasons.\nBut if not, then I think we'll do as you say and suspend. You make a lot of good points.\n\nCould you describe a bit more what sort of supports and accommodations you receive fromt he DRC re your ADHD?

When I expressed concern that none of the psychologists' bios on the website listed interest or experience in ADHD they spoke to them for me to recommend the most appropriate people.\n\n\\*Ultimately some things are at unit staff's discretion, particularly where it creates more work I guess. I have one unit that I'm doing via Cloud mode and it's horribly documented, sent an email last week but haven't heard back yet. So no guarantees for some things.\n\nMore suggestions:\n\n* Many tutors are pretty chill and will let you switch class sessions unofficially, even come to different ones each week (based on both my and a close friend's experiences; she's in another faculty)\n* It would be worth asking the aforementioned chill tutors about attending more than one class a week if that would help - if there's room they may allow it off the record; if this of interest as a regular thing it'd be worth asking the DRC about formalising this\n* Ultimately unit chairs and tutors are humans, so while the rules around extensions and whatnot sound scary, if you actually talk to them about any problems you are having most of them will help where they can (especially if you are proactive)\n* If you tell us what course he's doing, we can probably make some more specific suggestions \n\n*Edited into dot points for clarity and to add some more suggestions*",

At Monash, all fails will be removed from your transcript this semester do to COVID leniency. Therefore, if you stay enrolled in your units, you can still receive payments from Centrelink. Obviously this depends on the policy for Deakin but this could be an option for you to keep failed units off your transcript while still receiving Centrelink payments. Hope all goes well.",

I couldn't study full time due to my health issues (which were undiagnosed at the time) which meant I couldn't get the payment. I figured I'd share my experience with this. \n\nThe following trimester I dropped down to part time and was moved onto youth allowance as a jobseeker with an exemption to job seeking due to my health (I had my drs support in this). They can give you an initial three month exemption if you get your dr to sign a form (from what I experienced) and after that it gets fairly complicated. \n\nI did have a few additional things I needed to do, such as completing regular checks to say I haven't earned any money, attending fortnightly appointments with a job place (to literally go in and say no I haven't worked, no I still can't work and yes I'm still studying one unit), but the bit of mucking around was was worth it. I wasn't required to look for jobs, attend interviews, attend other training centres etc. \n\nYou should be sent to a disability orientated job place, which helps to some extent. During the initial appointment you will have to sign a contract with them - ensure everything written in it is something you are willing to comply with. What is expected of you will be written down - make sure they include what you do (one or two units etc.). Do not sign it if you're not happy with it - and make sure to read it through. That contract is as much to protect you as it is to get you to comply. Their goal is to find you a job and you won't fit into that criteria so they won't know what to do with you.\n\n You do have to be fairly honest and firm in that you can't work and that you're struggling enough trying to do the reduced amount of study you're currently completing. They will pressure you but that's their job and with a medical exemption they can't force you to look for work (but don't be assholes to them because they can make life very difficult). You will need to have an appointment with someone who will assess your \"work hours\" which is basically the most out of hours per week you can cope with studying or working. \n\nAnd then, when you're in a better position (diagnosed and on medication), you can enrol in uni full time and have your payments swapped back over to youth allowance as a student.\n\nGoing through this process with Centrelink was an absolute nightmare for me, but it's an option at least. It's not ideal but it sounds like it might be necessary in your partner's situation. \n\nHope this helps. Wishing you both all the best. \n\nIf you want to know more feel free to reach out.",

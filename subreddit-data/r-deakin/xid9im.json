    "postText": "Hi  there,\n\nCurrently doing an associates of deakin which I have at a 50% load to manage around shiftwork. \n\nBut I have concerns about it being recognised if I wanted to enter the workforce with it as it seems lighter than an associates from other universitys which seem to run to the end of second year instead of first like deakins. \n\nIs this the case and should I be worried about that? \n\nContinuing, I'd still like to complete my bachelors, as that has always been my goal, would It be feasible to do at the lightest loading possible or would there be complications with changing units through my studies. \n\ntldr; is deakins associates valued the same as other univerisites. &amp; can I do a bachelors at very low load to enter professional work while still working towards my bachelors.",

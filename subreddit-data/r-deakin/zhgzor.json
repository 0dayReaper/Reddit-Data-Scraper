However, Australian universities are generally free from discrimination and you are allowed to be whoever you want to be and present however you want to present. If anyone tries to tell you otherwise or makes fun of who you choose to be, you should report it. Please feel free to do what you want with your hair. :). I'm saddened you felt you needed to ask this question.\nA side note, as others suggested, there may be restrictions on clothing and hair tying regarding labs. They will be outlined in correct lab processes you will do, depending on different units.",

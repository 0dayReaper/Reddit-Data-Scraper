    "postText": "I just got Deakin Optometry ( Bachelor of Vision Science/Master of Optometry 3.5 yrs \uff09 conditional offer today.\n\nI've taken the gamsat twice and did very poorly. The best GAMSAT I got was UW &amp; W 45. I applied to 2023 Melbourne University optometry,. Although there doesn't seem to be an exact minimum gamsat requirement for optometry, I'm not really sure if I'll get in. (I'm still trying to get my wam up to 75-77 this year)\n\n2022 I'm an international student. But 2023 I'll get my permanent resident visa. So maybe the application way will change too.\n\nI am currently a 3rd year student at the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nI'm torn between going to Deakin or taking the gamsat again and applying to 2024 University of Melbourne OD.\n\nGuys! Could you please give me some suggestions?",

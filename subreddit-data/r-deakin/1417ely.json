It seems a shame to have state of the art audio visual tech, but facilitators who don\u2019t know how to stop YouTube auto playing videos over their lectures. \n\nI guess I\u2019m interested in how some of the older spaces (70s) are being retrofit (if at all) to keep up with the new ways of teaching?",

Sort of a \u201clead the horse to water but can\u2019t make it drink\u201d scenario. \n\nThe older spaces are tricky, they often have low ceilings which limit how high projection and LCD displays can be mounted which in turn limits viewing from the back of the room over other student\u2019s heads. The rooms themselves are actually managed by the Infrastructure &amp; Property group who decide which spaces are suitable for teaching use.",

    "postText": "Hey guys! Hope your 2022 has been great so far. I am organising a platform connecting uni students to high school students and am looking to recruit uni students to join. As you guys probably know, navigating the sea of course choices with vague information from uni websites was not an easy task.\n\nThis is your opportunity to change that for the incoming uni students - to help them make more informed choices. On top of that, **this will be a paid opportunity**!\n\nIf you're in your **second year of uni or above** and this sounds like a good idea to you, **please take 1 minute to fill out this form** and I will get in touch with further details:\n\n[https://forms.gle/4vCVT9V9EPspEXmi9](https://forms.gle/4vCVT9V9EPspEXmi9)\n\nTalk soon!",

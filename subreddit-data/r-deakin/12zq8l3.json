    "postText": "I am one of the upcoming International student for Australia. I am planning to pursue Masters of Professional Engineering in the field of Mechatronics or any field that would be relevant to Hardware Automation and Programming. I see that Australian universities have high global rankings but since I am not much aware about scenario of careers after Masters of Engineering in Australia, it creates a question in my mind about how reliable are the universities that have offered me admission for their coursework. All your suggestions are welcome here.",

I asked my counsellor to shortlist me Universities for Masters in Automation/Robotics/Embedded Systems/Mechatronics Engineering and Deakin and UoW were the best I could find amongst those within my budget. I asked my counsellor to apply for both on the same day. I received my conditional admission letter from Deakin within 2 days but still wanted to wait if I could receive another from UoW. Yet, the counsellor anyhow convinced me to appear for Deakin's GTE interview and pay for my first semester (July Intake) by getting me into the early deadline trap about University's fee payment within two weeks. After we were done with all of that process, I finally received my conditional admission letter from UoW within 21 days of application but this time it was not possible to pay the fees again since it was too late and even Deakin charges 10% of cancellation before 4 weeks of course commencement. I asked my counsellor if she could do anything about it but she refused saying that the fees could not be refunded leaving me with a disappointment. In fact, Deakin University offered me a 20% scholarship and UoW offered 30% for the same course. I think you're right... I shall contact the University for more clarification.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI had some questions regarding the bachelor of psychology at Deakin in the cloud campus. I have applied for T3 and I am wondering are there mandatory classes/tutorials that are scheduled? I currently work full-time in shift work so it would make it difficult to have to attend scheduled online classes. Can anyone who has studied this course let me know what the requirements are or if classes are recorded/ or attendance marked or is it all just self paced learning.\n\nThanks heaps!",

It's very flexible, however, some units may require an in-class live presentation so you'll just need to plan around those very rare occurences! Hope that helps, good luck!",

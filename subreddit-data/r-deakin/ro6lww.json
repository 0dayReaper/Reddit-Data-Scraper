    "postText": "I am currently weighing up between enrolling at the Waurn Ponds campus or the Burwood campus. Both campuses are a similar commute time from my home. This leaves me with some questions:\n\n- Which campus has easier/cheaper car parking?\n- Are there any clear advantages/disadvantages to either of the campuses?\n\nI would love to hear from some Deakin students about their experiences on campus.\n\nI will be undertaking a graduate diploma of psychological science, if that makes any difference. Any help is appreciated--thanks!",

            "comment": "Never been to Burwood but I'll mention that parking at Waurn Ponds is always easy. You can always get a (paid) parking space (car park 3 being the main one), there is also a free parking area that filled up daily during trimester, pre-pandemic.\n\nWaurn Ponds is pretty relaxed and has a bushland setting. It's quite a nice spot to spend your days studying. The main downside I would say is the lack of food options on campus, you're pretty much limited to one main cafeteria area or two/three other cafes (with limited opening hours, especially during the afternoon), unless you BYO. No nearby options off-campus either.",

But you've gotta bring lunch or you're either going hungry or choosing from a limited selection where the hot food is never hot enough. Conversely, I got into a breakfast routine at Sage when going to Burwood - eggs on toast, made fresh, for $6.",

Pretty full until it starts to empty out from about 2pm. Probably far, far easier to get into these days (and into trimester 1). The trouble is its just one smallish car park that's free, so its moths to a flame.\n\nThe other option I'd use was the free inter-campus (Waterfront-&gt;Waurn Ponds) bus, which has a free park-and-ride type setup halfway along its route.",

Downside is only every second train goes out to WP for most of the day, so approx. every 40 minutes.\n* There are other options such as South Geelong + 20 minute bus. \n\nBurwood\n\n* Less constrained by timetabling because frequency is better, but I find it to be quite a hike regardless of route.\n* The two routes I've used are:  \n\\- Train into city, train out to Box Hill, shuttle bus that drops you off in a convenient spot within the campus  \n\\- Train into city, tram out to the front of uni (Toorak Rd) that takes about an hour   \nThere's other train out + bus options too. \n\n**Driving**\n\nWaurn Ponds\n\n* Reliable travel time (at most times of day) because you're going against the peak traffic, but would be further for you compared to a good run to Burwood (around an hour or so)\n\nBurwood\n\n* Less reliable travel time because you're often going with peak traffic, but a good run would be well under an hour for you\n* Possible tolls depending which route you take (there are ways to avoid tolls but that can result in dealing with more traffic\n* Probably a bit of trial-and-error to work out when the best time to travel is for you\n   * There's lots of places to hang out and study, places to eat etc so it's not the end of the world if you have to arrive a few hours before your classes or hang back if you want to avoid sitting in too much traffic.\n\n[Parking costs the same at both campuses](https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/locations/campuses/parking), $6.40 a day (or less if you're not there for under whatever the \"day\" threshold his) and you can get a longer-term parking permit if you're going to be there often enough that it would work out cheaper. As others have mentioned, WP does have a free carpark too if you get there early enough.",

I probably would opt to go to Burwood if I take PTV everyday, but will opt for Waurn Ponds if I do end up deciding to drive. \n\nConsidering the lack of car parks at Burwood and toll road, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good option for driving. I think I might end up doing a trial run of the PTV option to Burwood and the drive to Waurn Ponds sometime in the new year haha. Thanks again!",

The uncertain travel time can be stressful and hard to plan around, it's expensive (I tend to take the toll road, the other routes through the city/inner suburbs would stress me out). The PT routes are a drag too but at least you can read or something. \n\nParking was ok there when I was there a bit in T1 this year, but that's not normal - far less students because of covid.",

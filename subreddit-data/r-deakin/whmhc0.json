    "postText": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m hoping to get some opinions from anyone studying IT courses at Deakin or have taken the capstone project. I\u2019m currently stuck in a dilemma of choosing to take Capstone Part A on the third trimester then Part B on the second trimester next year or delay my completion by another trimester by having Part A on T2 next year and Part B on T3. \n\nI\u2019m suppose to graduate by T2 next year but if I follow the latter option, my completion gets delayed by around 3 months and the graduation ceremony by almost a year. It\u2019s not too big of an issue but I rather not delay my completion if possible but having Capstone on two separate trimesters does bring with it alot of problems",

That said, a few people did what I did so there were a few others doing the unit at the same times I did.\n\nThat said, the assessments for the unit lean very strongly towards preparing documentation and project management/scrum master skills. So very easy to transfer between projects, or pick up a project halfway.",

I found it helpful, as I could spend more time on each unit.\n\nJust make sure that the units you drop aren't required as prerequisites for anything between now and when you can do them again. \n\n*Edit\"* also, Centrelink benefits and some scholarships have workload requirements, which is another thing to be aware of.\n\nThe T3 units that I've done have been wholly online, but some have had a compulsory class during an intensive week. It should be in the unit guide if this is likely to occur.",

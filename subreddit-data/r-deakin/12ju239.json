I've heard really great stuff for both and I'm interested in both of these! Maybe it's possible if I do both, but I don't know. If it is, please let me know. If not, then please help me decide which course I should take and state your reasons.\n\nThanks!",

I could be wrong, but while computer science and software engineering focus on both the robot and computer itself and the software it runs on and IT stuff like that, I heard that computer science focuses more on the former and that software engineering focuses more on the latter (Again, I can be very wrong, so please correct me if I am. The next statement after this P.S. could be wrong again), and these four jobs usually focus on the improvement, management and problem solving of a business' software side.\n\nThanks again!",

It emphasizes the engineering aspects of software systems, including their design, implementation, and maintenance. This degree could be more suited for the roles of Software Architect and Application Architect, as these roles involve designing, building, and maintaining software systems.\n\nBachelor of Computer Science - This degree covers a broader range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational theory. It emphasizes the theoretical and mathematical aspects of computing. This degree may be more applicable to the roles of Solutions Architect and Enterprise Architect, as these roles often require a broader understanding of the technology landscape and the ability to design and integrate various systems to meet specific business needs.\n\nImo computer science is more broader and would give a better understanding of the entire technology landscape and not just a specific area like the prior one would.",

Will you stay in Aus or return to your home country? Comparisons with entry level positions in your chosen field in Aus and your home country etc.",

Also know about how many subjects you would have to learn in a semester, how the course is distributed. If there's any lab work, intership, when do you do the final project etc. Side tip, also look up the labs they offer if you are under STEM\n\nBasically Deakin offers a 3 year stayback right, so research on the companies the older students were in. You can ask them to share contact of the previous alumni of your course. I found people of my course in this sub as well. \n\nAlong with that also research on the opportunities you have if you come back to your home country. What will be your qualifications, what salary are you expecting after graduation from Deakin. Just Google it. An easy way is to say you want to go for masters ( assuming you're undergrad )",

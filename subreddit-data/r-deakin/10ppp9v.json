    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI am planning to do both SIT112 (Data science concepts) and SIT221 (Data structures and alogrithms) in Tri 1 this year. I've seen some posts about SIT112 on this subreddit, as well as discords for both classes, that make me a bit anxious as apparently both classes are quite difficult?\n\nIs there anything I could do to prepare for either of the classes? I gather SIT112 uses Python, particuarly NumPy? But I'm unsure if that's still true. I also think that SIT221 uses C#? \n\nAny info on either class would be really appreciated, as I'd like to spend my free time after work each day preparing for them before the trimester starts. \n\nAlternatively I was originally thinking of doing SIT112 and SIT223 (Professional practice in Information Technology) in Tri 1, so if you have any insight as to whether this is perhaps an easier study load feel free to let me know. I only swapped to SIT221 as this is a Tri 1 unit, whereas SIT223 is Tri 1/ Tri 2. \n\nThanks in advance",

Key concepts are more like how to transform data into multi dimensional matrices and check for similarities, then how to visualise.\n\nDefinitely brush up on numpy and matlab.\n\nI would also love some tips on SIT221 though as I'm doing that this semester.",

Are you possibly doing SIT223?\nThere's a discord with people doing SIT221 in it if you're not already there, I reckon that'd be helpful if you're stressed.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m from Texas, USA, and I\u2019m looking to study Zoology and Wildlife Conservation in Australia, and Deakin is one of my top picks right now. I was wondering if anyone from that program, or even anyone from Waurn Pond campus would be willing to answer some questions of mine about the school and surrounding area? I would really appreciate it. Thank you all so much!\n\nEDIT: I know it's fairly late for y'all right now so I'll ask questions when it's not the middle of the night! Thank you all!",

In the course info it says:\n\n\"Deakin is a leader in the environmental science education sector, with this specialised course being the first of its kind to be offered in Victoria.\"\n\nThey will sell you Zoology and Wildlife Conservation, but in the core units there is only two subjects that are even related to Wildlife. Over here we call that \"bullshit\". \n\nPut this course at the very very very top of your list: [https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/uc/bachelor-of-science-and-bachelor-of-advanced-studies-taronga-wildlife-conservation.html](https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/uc/bachelor-of-science-and-bachelor-of-advanced-studies-taronga-wildlife-conservation.html)\n\nIt will be very competitive to get into, but you'll actually be studying what you want to study. \n\n(Disclaimer: I'm a bitter final year student, if you couldn't already tell)",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm transferring to Deakin next semester for Computer Science. I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations on majors/minors/electives for CS? Deakin offers a lot more than my current Uni, and while a lot of the majors/minors look interesting to me I'm also curious to hear any recommendations from people who have taken any of these units. \n\nThanks",

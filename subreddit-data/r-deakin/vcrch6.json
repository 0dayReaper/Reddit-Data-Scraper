    "postText": "Disclaimer: I am not a Deakin student. I always use the car park in the evening and on weekends as it is right by my work. I parked there this Monday being a public holiday, and lo and behold I had a ticket for $109 when I went back to my car at the end of the day.\n\nBut, do I need to pay it? They threaten you with court action and will send a follow up letter (I\u2019ve received one before, and got intimidated and paid), but will they actually follow through?\n\nI\u2019ve been told by students that they will withhold results from students until they settle their debt, but me not being a student, is there a reason to pay it?",

Because they\u2019re private I reckon they\u2019d be serious about enforcing the fine.",

Labour Day and Melbourne Cup are the other public holidays which Deakin staff &amp; students don't get (although a lot of people use a day of leave for them so they can share the day with family/friends)",

Maybe they won't bother for a single offence.

Description:

r/deakin is an unofficial community for Deakin University students, faculty, staff and alumni.

Rules:

No spam, advertising, or research surveys: Posts or comments solely for the purposes of advertising or spamming will be deleted. 

While we love researchers and the work that you do - unfortunately this sub is too small to facilitate the absolutely massive volume of research survey requests we receive - and sadly these posts go unengaged with and deter genuine engagement. Unless you are a frequent contributor to the sub, please post surveys to r/samplesize.

Please check for FAQs before posting: Please have a read of some recent posts and use the search bar to find your answer before posting a single-answer post. 

Duplicate posts (ie. if you ask the same question as another poster within the same month/trimester) without adding any extra discussion topics or questions will be removed by the auto mod.

No subreddit drama: Submissions and comments made for the purpose of creating subreddit drama or harassing other users will be deleted and users may incur a ban. Brigading within, to, or from this subreddit, will result in a ban. This includes appealing for up/down votes or using FB or YT to direct traffic here.

Be nice: Consider the person when commenting. Threats, personal insults/abuse, ad hominem attacks, aimed at other redditors or offensive comments including bigotry, racism and homophobia are not welcome.

Deakin's academic integrity rules apply here, too: Attempts at cheating, collusion, soliciting others to complete assessments, or advertising services that promote cheating will result in an instant and permanent ban.

Low-effort posts get removed: The auto mod will remove all posts that are deemed low-effort, for example: 

-posts with a question in the title but no explanation  in the body
-links without discussion, 
-posts that may be FAQs (see duplicate post rule)

The automod is checked by human mods regularly and interesting/ discussion-worthy content is always approved (incl. memes and jokes). If you think there has been a mistake please message the mods. 

Memes and jokes are ok.

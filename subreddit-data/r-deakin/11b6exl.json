Are these seminars something which are recorded and I can view in my own time or is it compulsory to attend them live?",

Best bet is to see if there are any other available times that you can attend, as you mentioned that you are an online student, there usually are more than one time for a seminar. There's usually multiple seminar times all running at different times. And you can always ask on the discussion board if a later time could be done.",

It's why Deakin cannot grade you on attendance. Deakin doesn't give a rat's if you engage or not. You just pay your money and they hope you don't drop out by census date.",

But some do benefit from it and depending on the subject you are studying, a seminar can help you understand the content better and feel more comfortable and confident in it.",

If I recall the seminars do not have to be recorded. Only the lectures do.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI need a little help. So I was not able to submit a 40% paper and applied for special consideration with a medical certificate because I was not doing well mentally at that time, but they didn't approve of it. I was just wondering if anyone has encountered a similar situation? What are other ways I can do to appeal so the unit chair considers my paper.  I really cannot fail this unit. Any insight will be appreciated. Thank you",

For example, if you had 6 weeks notice on this paper, and submitted the consideration less than a week to due date, it doesn't look good from their perspective. \nThese big assignments are typically given early in semester.",

It's the same excuse but it's a valid one so I'm confused why it wasn't granted. Is there anyone I can talk to about this?",

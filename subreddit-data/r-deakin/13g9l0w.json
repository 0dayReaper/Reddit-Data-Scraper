    "postText": "Hello, I'm Matteo and I'm an incoming exchange student for T2. I applied for on-campus accommodation but I haven't heard from Deakin back yet and I'm supposed to be there in less than 6 weeks. I'm now considering Houseme but the rent seems absurdly cheap. Are the places left scams? Do you have any advice? I obviously can't inspect the place myself prior to signing the lease given that I live on the other side of the world. I'd really appreciate your help!",

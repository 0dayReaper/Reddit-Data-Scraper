            "comment": "Wow, sorry nobody has responded to you. So if you are 4 units away from completing an undergraduate degree, my personal advice is to intermit for some time if needed and finish the degree. Of course I don't know your circumstances and you say that you're in a bad place - so absolutely do what is best for you. Your health comes first. However if you are able to intermit instead of withdraw (apply to take a trimester or a year of leave from your course), and come back and finish it - you will have a whole degree under your belt - and if you ever want to come back and study, it will be easier. for example you will qualify for postgraduate courses (masters, graduate diplomas) and you don't always have to do a postgrad degree in the same discipline that you did your undergrad in. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that having a degree under your belt makes your job searches easier. Even if you don't want a career in your study area (you'd be surprised how many people are in the same boat - honestly most people!), you still have learned all these skills and maybe even understand a bit more about what you DO want to do, and you qualify for all of these jobs that now need a 'bachelor degree'. \n\nI didn't end up getting a job in the same area that I studied - I kind of took a side step into a completely different job but in the same industry. I really like my job and I'm glad I finished my degree. I can relate to your comment about not being able to finish it because of family reasons - I almost dropped out in my final year too. Everything was just insanely bad and it was probably the hardest thing I have ever done. I completely understand if you read this and it makes you mad and you still want to drop out because I do relate to how hard it is to keep going when everything is messed up. Just take my advice with a grain of salt. \n\nLastly... If you really want to drop out - you can withdraw before the census date. You won't get a degree but if you ever wanted to re-enter the course, you can apply to do so. As long as you have a good personal statement explaining how things have improved (if you drop out and your last units were bad grades), and as long as the course hasn't changed and they can give you credit for whatever your studied it should be ok. You can also apply for a new course and apply to have some of your units brought over as credit... Generally they will sit in your new course as electives, unless they are directly transferrable in your new degree (ie unit x from old degree is the same as unit y in new degree). \n\nI hope this helps",

            "comment": "hello, have you considered just deferring your final trimester for a bit (idk your situation and whether it will turn better anytime soon) but i believe you can try to appeal? i guess you can also try to ask for ungraded units (depending on how well you did) \n\notherwise, if you do return to uni after dropping out (whether same course or school or not) i think some of your units could be recognised as prior learning and you get to take some credits off. \n\ni hope you know that there are people here for you (and deakin for some reason is amazing at student\u2019s wellbeing) and i wish you could reach out to a professional staff for better advice before actually withdrawing. do drop me a chat if you do need a friend though (i\u2019m currently a student in deakin as well!) atb \u263b",

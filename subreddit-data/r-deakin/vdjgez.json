            "comment": "Hi there,\n\nfrom my experience, it is really hard to tell in advance how much work there will be. I did the grad cert in data analytics in T2 2020, and was able to do 4 units while working 4 days a week (my employer gave me a day for study leave, which really helped). I managed 2x HD, 1x D and 1 x C, which I was overall happy with. I had to miss a few things in my submissions, and make judgements on what I could and could not get done in my time, but it seemed to work ok.\n\nThen in T2 2021 I did another 2 units which got me my grad cert in AI, again I was given a day each week for study leave. However, the total overall workload from the 2 units was similar to the 4 units I had done previously. In particular, there was SIT787, which was very maths heavy (I haven't really done much maths except statistics for 30 years!) and there were multiple assignments, each of which I submitted between 25 - 35 handwritten pages of formula and working out etc. I only managed 2 x D.\n\nIn T1 2022 I began the Master in Applied Artificial Intelligence. Again, I only did 2 units, and only worked 4 days a week. However, half way through the trimester, my wife needed surgery and was bedridden for weeks, plus at work there was an urgent need to start working really hard on stuff I was unfamiliar with, so I was doing extra training on that as well. Because of the extra circumstances, these 2 units were also hard to complete. I don't know what marks I will get, but I am thinking it will be another 2 x D.\n\nI'm going to be doing 3 units in T2 2022, and honestly I don't know what to expect. My wife told me last week that she is booked in for another surgery right at the start of the trimester, and my work has let me know that there will be a lot of changes coming up too - so I am a bit anxious as to how it will all play out.\n\nYou can definitely do 4 units, and work, and do well. However, there isn't much wriggle room. If life events or work situations change and take up more time and mental space, then it will be harder - and there is no way of knowing if a unit will take up more time than you expect, unless you can talk to people who have already done it.\n\nI haven't done any of those units, so I can't really help with those specifically. I haven't had much luck on this subreddit trying to find people who are doing the same units I am.",

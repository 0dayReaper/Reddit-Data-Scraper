We are a small community but we love to help.  \nTo cut down on recurring standalone self-posts asking the same question, we ask that all requests for enrolment support, questions about troubleshooting and new student help be posted in the megathread.  \nTo help get you started, here are some links to help answer frequently asked questions:\n\n* [Accept your offer](https://www.deakin.edu.au/international-students/how-to-apply/accepting-your-offer)\n* [How to enrol](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/enrolment-fees-and-money/enrolments/how-to-enrol)\n* [Get help from a student adviser](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/help/student-central)\n\nStudent Central is your starting point for help with information and access to a wide range of services at Deakin.\n\n  \nIf you see someone ask a question that you've found the answer to - pay it forward!",

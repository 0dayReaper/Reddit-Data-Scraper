    "postText": "Hey guys, current year 12 student here. I'm in regional Victoria and am looking to do mechatronic engineering next year. I've been to both Monash and Deakin (Waurn Ponds in Geelong) open days, but I still can't decide which Uni I'd enjoy more. The Waurn Ponds campus has some brand new accommodation and the campus seems real nice, but there is not as much versatility as far as food and in general there doesn't seem like as much stuff to do in Geelong. Monash is huge, but their accommodation is a bit dated, and it doesn't seem as homely having 30,000+ students. They have tons of stuff on campus and I really like the idea of living in Melbourne as there seems like so much more to do. I also have a car, but going around Melbourne I imagine I'd be using public transport much of the time. Living at either Uni I'd be catching a bus then a train to get into the city either way, which are both around 1 hour+. It'd be great to get any more info from you guys on the Uni itself and the engineering courses!",

Go to the innovative one that genuinely tries hard to provide a good undergrad learning experience, is genuinely interested in and responds to student feedback, has more consistent and transparent admin, and has a much friendlier overall vibe.\n\nAgain, didn't so engineering, but that's my two cents.",

            "comment": "The mechatronics course is pretty hands on. There is typically a project unit each trimester, (although, I've had two semesters where I had to do two seperate projects) where you have to build something of your own design to solve a set challenge. These can get pretty involved, but I prefer them to exams any day. There are workshops and labs with tools and hardware, so it's not a problem if you don't have any of your own.\n\nAnd if you're doing full time engineering, you won't have to worry about what is available to do in Geelong, you probably won't have time anyway. A 75% workload is worth considering for T1 and T2, and picking up some extra units over T3.",

But I really enjoyed the project-based learning that Deakin mechatronics used \u2014 teach both theory and application together is way more satisfying and engaging than the old-school \u201chit the books now, learn the craft on the job\u201d approach.",

Generally, the canteen has a broad range of food options from sandwiches, carby comfort foods, healthy and international options as well as fried goods. Lots of pastries too. Rotated out every day. If that isn't your tastes, there is a massive shopping centre only a 10 minute walk away. \n\nFood is such a tiny part of what makes a routine but I genuinely believe you won't have the slightest issue with it at WP.",

Geelong is a huge and varied city by any non-metro standard in Australia and you really do have everything you need locally without needing to travel far.",

            "comment": "Coming from someone who did 2 years of Mechatronics at Deakin before transferring, I will say that the course is extremely involved each trimester, as you\u2019ll have something probably every day. As for any engineering unit, you\u2019ll be busy for 3-4 years of the course and will also be making some sort of project every single trimester. The teachers are hit and miss for each Unit, as the 2 credit point units take up a lot of time to get a great mark on. I only transferred because I lost a lot of interest in my second year, plus it became unbearably messy when COVID hit and it was the most stressful experience ever. I did engineering at Deakin due to being in Geelong, however again it\u2019s up to you to choose based on convenience",

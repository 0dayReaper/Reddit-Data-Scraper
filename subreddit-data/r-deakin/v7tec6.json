    "postText": "Hello everyone! \n\nSo I just got accepted into Deakin for their master of sustainability program. Looking for any advice on how the program was ? Did you enjoy it , where you able to find a good internship? Or even how Deakin was and your experience there. \n\nA little background, I did my undergrad in Canada in Marine Biology and I have always wanted to live and work in Australia perhaps, due to its incredible landscape and scenic oceans. Just any advice on Melbourne as well would be awesome. Cheers!",

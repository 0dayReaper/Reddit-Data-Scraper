How many clubs is it feasible to balance with a full course load at uni? \nWhich clubs would you recommend? (I'm looking for something that is lively and social!)\nFeel free to shout out any club where you had an excellent experience",

            "comment": "deakin clubs just host optional events, and joining them gives you discounts and access to members-only events, so you could really join as many as you like. last year I signed up to 6 different clubs and went to about 12 different events total. You dont really need to \"balance\" them with uni at all as its not like there's a workload. The Deakin Geelong queer collective was by far the most active club I signed up to, followed by Deakin adventurers. A fair few never advertised any events so its hit or miss, I would recommend looking and their instas to see if they are active or not. Check to see if a club has a discord too, its great to meet people on there through the club.",

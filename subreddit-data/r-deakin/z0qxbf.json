I\u2019ve lived at deakin res, from my personal experience ce:\nGood (pros)\n- Easy to get to campus as it\u2019s only a 10 min MAX\n- meet people and social life if interested\n- loads of weekly events and \u201cfree\u201d food at events! (It\u2019s free but u technically pay for it in rent)\n- security, fast internet (very fast through an internet cable)\n- extra o week of events just for res students \n- res ball (extra $99 approx for your ticket but event of the year)\n- make friends to make moving off res easier as you will already have housemates \n\u2014- sorry there is less pros but they are big pros\n\nCons;\n- if you get a bad group of people in your building it can make life a living HELL! \n- $230 approx rent per week! ($33 a day) - you also have to pay for parking as a resident (and student if you were to live off campus- for 1 year it\u2019s cheapest to get a 365 day permit for $365) \n- if you need to focus on study and neighbours are loud it\u2019s hard to get anyone to quiet down until noise curfew (11pm) \n- rules can be kind of strict on res, eg; during study periods no drinking on campus and quiet at all times for the 3 weeks\n- parties of over 10 people in a shared accom is shut down even if contained\n- have to stay near laundry to ensure your stuff isn\u2019t taken out of the washing machine/dryer and placed to the side or even stolen (if it\u2019s stolen DRS take no responsibility for this as the handbook says we should be watching)\n- if anything happens to your car on campus. DRS cannot be held responsible as you acknowledge that they take no responsibility for cars on campus (which is fair, but multiple number plates were stolen and nothing was done which is very expensive as a student to replace!!) \n- fire alarms so sensitive!! And if fire trucks are called automatically with the alarms it is expensive $$$$\n\nSorry for the long post just trying to be as transparent as possible. Overall it\u2019s a great place to live as a student but read the contract and handbook to understand what is expected. I loved my time on res but the cons did add a bit of a cloud to the blue and sunny sky! \nGood luck with your decision, I wish you all the best :)",

But it happens either way. The first 4 weeks at least is normally super loud due to o week and the parties etc. but if it continues and or it\u2019s annoying. Security, DRS reception and your RLs will be able to help :)) \n\nIt\u2019s definitely not all bad with noise it\u2019s just something to be mindful of :)))))",

I think I\u2019ll have friends from my homecountry come to visit and even though it will surely be very cozy, I\u2019d at least like to offer them that they can stay at my place.",

It\u2019s a GREt place to live and build a good foundation with people and the ease to get to campus is incredible!! (Just being honest with my cons as I were never told the cons before moving on) \n\nLook, yes and no. If you live in shared and have a housemate who would snitch if someone stayed longer then yes they COULD be strict (but idk I was in a studio) \nI stayed there before and during covid, before covid it wasn\u2019t really a big deal, most people don\u2019t even put in guest passes so if you do reception think you\u2019re like an angel or something hahaha but it\u2019s not enforced like they don\u2019t knock on your door an check (it\u2019s only if you are making heaps of noise etc maybe?? - but again making a good relationship with your neighbours help!!) \n\nDuring covid it was so strict but we aren\u2019t in covid rn so you don\u2019t have to worry about that!!! \n\nI had people stay more often than 3 nights in the week, and wasn\u2019t caught so it is chill in that retrospect - I also had neighbours who didn\u2019t care/ one neighbour that wasnt there half the time. \n\nTLDR: it\u2019s 50/50 it can be strict but it can be very very chill at the same time :)))\n\nEdit: also they have scholarships next year for the first time ever so take advantage of that!!",

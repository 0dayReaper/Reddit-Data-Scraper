    "postText": "What is the typical structure of the orientation day program at Deakin University for international students? Are there scheduled activities such as campus tours and information sessions, or is it more flexible for students to explore at their own pace? Because I saw some videos on youtube and it seemed very eventful, with a lot of pop up stalls, activities and entertainment, it was kinda overwhelming for me. I hope to find someone who has experienced orientation day to give me a heads up on what to expect and how to go about the day. Anyone?",

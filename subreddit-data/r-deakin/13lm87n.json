    "postText": "  Hello Im not from Australia and I need some info on enrolling in Bachelor of Arts (psychology) T3. I am aware that T1 and T2 are where most students will study, so I am wondering how my course pathway will look like if I enrol in T3. I have seen previous years' course pathway and it seems like students who enrol in T3 as their Y1 will finish in T1 of Y4. Will this be the case for me? If so, it would make sense to enrol in T3 of this year as I would still finish the course earlier than someone who enrols in T1 of 2024. Thank you in advance for the help \ud83d\ude17",

Refreshing and fulfilling. Left with winding up things by June 8th, i.e. 2 lab reports, the CAD submission and the 2 exams! Finally, ending a trimester. \n\nSEP291?!?! What's that one pal?\n\nAlso, if you'd like to say anything about CAD, absolutely do so!! \n\nP.S.\nI see it's Engineering modelling. Is it a part of Mechatronics Engineering?\n\nP.S.\nYes it is!!!!!!\nLevel 2, T1. Eligible to do it after taking SIT194. I will definitely do so. \n\nExcept Level 1 T1 &amp; T2 and SEP291, from your side, shed some light on the rest !! \nhttps://www.deakin.edu.au/current-students-courses/course.php?course=S463&amp;year=2023\n\n\nAt this point, can I know what all units run throughout this year and 2024 ? Whom to approach ?",

Learn how to make manufacturable (3d printed/lasercut) parts and assembles before your second year it really helps and not something that is super well touched on. I learnt alot from designing my own things to 3d print. The actual SET111 class doesn't actually require that detailed or realistic a model. I got really good marks and I just made a goofy portable toaster that was battery powered. Its really about understanding the tools and software then it is about manufactoable parts.\n\n**SEP105:** Intro to programming is difficult but take time to learn how code works at a high level before trying to jump into thew assignments. I learnt to program in python first using no starch press books but you can finds tons of rescources on c/c++ in the library, having good programming skills in really important in mechatronics **Especially SEM200**\n\n**SEM200:** Warman robot compition is a really fun unit but a tons of work (I spent over 50 hours in the lab in the final week), my team did really well this year (2nd year mech) but having a bit of cad and arduino experience is LIFE SAVING. Biggest tip for this class is KEEP IT SIMPLE, try to avoid complex sensors and controls, have a look at this years and last years winning robot to see what I mean, I'm going to put mine up in the electronics lab soon. All the teams that did well had at least one guy who was really switched on when it came to CAD or arduino, the rest had little direction. Try to get on a team with motivated likeminded people, my team left 2 people doing all the work. Speak to the guys who won the last couple years they also have really good advice and love to chat about it. \n\n**Try to get ahead in your other classes before warman hits the fan it always will**\n\n**UNITS:** It should list on the website the unt course directions on the linked website\n\nif you have any other questions just ask",

Btw, been working on 3d modelling the wet grinder with recessed bush, driven pulley, belt, jar and clearly what not ! After acing assignment 1, the remaining part (Assignment items 5-10) are waiting for me ! I'd love to compile 3 modifications (or more like 2) for ending with the best refined wet grinder, than deleting and all! My thoughtful process behind coming up with a wholesome wet grinder would be clearly comprehended as a result of items 5-10. Nothing to delete as such for what's worth; just combine one on top of other and that's where the designer's painting would be actually seen! So 6,7,8 and fairly 9 n 10 are pretty intact. The information sketches for item 5 is just a bit repetitive. Already sketched the 2d versions of the 3d model for in item 3 ig; the one that's named as the concept sketches. Gotta combine all of them into one info sketch for item 5 cause I'm deleting none of the 3 concept sketches. I know that \"choosing\" is the thing of item 4 but choosing to combine and making it a refined beauty that is multifaceted can't be any better. It will be sustainable and all. I'm just thinking of what all the design objectives (right?...yk, design objects, concepts and criteria overlap with one another a lot) I can talk about. For example, there's no design for dematerialization by deleting components but adding simple, small and cute components to make it hassle-free experience when dealing with the wet grinders. And my point is I'm designing to make it hasslefree, i.e. no spillout , recessed bush of increased length, ON/OFF cock, good belt tensioner and finest additions that make ir sophisticated and efficient. Ok so that's about it. G2G fr!!.",

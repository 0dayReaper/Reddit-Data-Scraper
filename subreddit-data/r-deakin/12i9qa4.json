            "comment": "It's pretty simple. Market logic turns students into customers. You want as many customers as possible, so you lower entry standards and fail no-one. Lectures, tutorials,  marking, and administration are all costs to be minimised. The result is crashing academic standards and executives who lie to you as normal operating procedure. \n\nThe system is hanging on by a thread, and that thread is the willingness of casual and permanent academic staff to make up the shortfall. Not one executive I have ever spoken to thinks about the mission of our universities to educate and advance society.",

University executive have made some of the dumbest decisions recently, even beyond my wildest imagination of dumb decisions - to justify and cover up their lack of vision and empathy. Students are certainly customers, and herding them through is just statistics in insane and nonsensical KPIs that admin staff have to keep up with. Some of the metrics don\u2019t even mean anything, it\u2019s just numbers go brrrrr. Everything else gets done off the back of exploited academic staff. Education used to be a valued industry in Australia but it\u2019s embarrassing now where we\u2019re at",

The similarities of a business and the progression towards casual is surprising but not outside the ballpark of expectations from businesses.\n\nIt's sad because I love learning and teaching and watching others learn either from me or alongside me.\nThis dark pathway of monetary gains where quantity is valued over quality deeply upsets me. And the students and staff are the ones affected. I watch staff who cherish teaching and love seeing passionate students, yet they suffer under pressure. Students themselves suffer because they aren't getting a quality education because of the lacking support for staff. And also, it sounds tough, but I don't want to see a student get qualified when they shouldn't be. This I leading to a dark future full of antivax scientists as an example.",

I've had access to previous lecture slides and videos where the same mistakes in lecture slides and the same errors in some of the content knowledge are present in classes I eventually attended.\nThere are more things I am not comfortable discussing here.\n\nWhat I typed was due to the comparison of the news article you posted. Academics are stretched thin, and some of the evidence is in the units lack of updating yearly.",

The units get handballed to sessionals and never updated. A look at the reading list is often a good indicator. Nothing newer than 2015?",

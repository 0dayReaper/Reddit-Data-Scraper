If you\u2019re good with Excel already you\u2019ll have a slight advantage in one of the assignments. \n\nYou do learn some interesting concepts which help explain the current state of the world and why interest rates are constantly increasing.",

The exam was easy as fuck but then again if you are taking it next year when the exams will be done in person it might be a bit challenging to remember all the formulas. My main advice is to get started on the assignment as early as you can and make sure to attend the drop in sessions! You\u2019ll thank me later! I did pretty in the assignment but was able to pull through and get 95+ in the exam which got me HD overall! But that meant that I had to sacrifice my sleep.",

You will have to study to some degree if you have never done economics just to get an understanding of an area but its an easy subject and a HD with study is not difficult. Also the maths is basic relative to other micro economics units.",

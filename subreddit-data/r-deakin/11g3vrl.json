    "postText": "I'm looking to join Deakin University for a masters in data science (professional), I just wanted to get some feedback about the course from current students/alumini. How are the job prospects after the course? Honestly, my main preference was a master's in cybersecurity, but I was told that I can specialize in it with a master's in data science. I'm still researching about the same since I'm an international student and it's a pretty huge decision. Any kind of feedback would be really helpful. Thank you",

My interest is mostly on cybersecurity but I also don't mind data science and find it quite fun as well. The only two courses that I've been offered are Data science (professional) and Applied AI (professional). \nWould you say it is worth doing the course?",

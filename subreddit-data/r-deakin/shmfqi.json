I was just wondering if I could do the same via direct application?\n\nEDIT: I should have definitely added that I have completed a bachelors of criminology via Deakin in 2020 if that helps!",

Your application will be reviewed and they will either decline or approve your application. \n\n If you have finished year 12 over 7 years ago, you will most likely have to do a STAT test, unless you have relevant work experience.",

I did this a few years back, so not exactly sure how it works for mature-aged VTAC applications.",

It looks like you're asking about applying to college or university as an older what they call a non-traditional student. There's nothing wrong with applying to school later in life as long as you are able to handle the rigors of school.  There is no age limit. Learn as much as you can. \n\nIf you attend school in-person it might be uncomfortable to sit around so many young people in their late teens and early twenties. Then again, it might be a breath of fresh air. People might ask you questions about your life experiences and regardless of the age gap, you might make a lot of friends and professional connections. If you attend school online the networking opportunities are still there just different since it's online. \n\nCongratulations towards your first step in achieving the life that you want! You can do it! Having a support system will help a lot too especially on nights when you're exhausted or might want to give up. The encouragement to keep going is good to have. \ud83d\ude01",

I am turning 23 this year and am just finding my footing in life in terms of what I want to do - I have been overthinking the whole doing another bachelors thing for another 4 years!!",

I guess you saying 'mature aged student' threw me off a bit. To help you understand what I'm saying I'll tell you a quick story. My father served 22 years in the military and finally got his Bachelor's degree at the age of 40. He didn't stop. He went on to get his Masters and then a PhD. My story was somewhat similar. After my military service I went back to school as a non-traditional student and got my Bachelor's degree at like 27 and then my Masters. What I'm saying is, don't let your age deter you from what you want in life. Life is short. Since you already have your Bachelor's you know a bit of what to expect. Regarding applying to multiple courses, absolutely you can but are you asking if you can enroll in multiple universities at the same time? I'm not sure that would be allowed, but that's a great question for admissions. Sounds like you're on the right track! \ud83d\ude01",

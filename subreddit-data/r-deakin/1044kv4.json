    "postText": "Hi!!\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations on easy WAM boosters (attainable HD) units in mostly the science/health areas? (biology, psych etc) I need a few extra electives and want some relatively easier units that will boost my overall WAM. 1st or 2nd year units preferably. \n\nI've currently got a list of all the environment, psych, easy maths, physiology, health units and a few random extras (social/anthropology/culture arts units too?) but struggling to narrow down so if anyone has any first hand experience with any of these sorts of subjects and how easy they are to get HD's please let me know!!\n\nthank you!!!",

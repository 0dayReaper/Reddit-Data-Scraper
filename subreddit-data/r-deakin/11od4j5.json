    "postText": "Hey all.\n\nI am currently enrolled at a TAFE doing a Certificate IV in Laboratory Techniques with the hopes of going into the Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Science double degree for the trimester 1 intake next year at the Waurn Ponds campus.\n\nFor some more context, I have never touched a VCE class in my life, leaving after year 10 to pursue a passion of mine and now returning to the educational world.\n\nBefore doing my TAFE course, it claimed that an outcome could be going to the Bachelor of Science after but it\u2019s the double degree part that makes me a bit uneasy. My teacher told me a former student went into the double degree after they finished the certification but I\u2019m unsure on if they finished VCE as well.\n\nOverall, I am confident if I challenge myself, put in the work, I have a good chance; but some clarity on the subject may ease my head a little.\n\nI also come looking for advice on the application process as well. What can I do now to really stand out, raise my chances to the stars? Stuff like extracurriculars, if having some writing or music works could help, everything that I could possibly do to enhance my chances; maybe even, if I can be optimistic, aim for a scholarship too.\n\nI appreciate your time and any advice, thank you so much.",

Completing the cert IV demonstrates that you're able to undertake a course to completion.\n\nThere might be some bridging units available if you haven't completed any prerequisites, which could make the transition a bit easier.",

Can be easier to get in if you go for mid year intake tho, and definitely write a good personal statement. If you can prove that you can study and complete a course, then you shouldn\u2019t have problems.",

If you want to be tactical about it, you can apply for the single degree (Science) and then transfer later to the double if you are going well.\n\nThe question is, why the Arts/Science? It seems like you have a science background, but are you prepared to be writing long-form essays and the like in the Arts side of things?\n\nJust contact the uni for advice on application. They have lots of staff for exactly that purpose.",

It will be easy to take single major because double major required higher score. I think you are able to undertake bachelor of science and beware of choose of major because certificate IV are forcing on laboratory medicine which more related to biomedical sciences and you may also consider chemistry as my experience",

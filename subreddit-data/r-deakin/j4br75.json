    "postText": "This is just a quick mention for the services that are available at Deakin. I'm right at the end of my degree now and I wish I had known about these services sooner.\n\n1. If you live with any kind of disability, including mental health issues (depression, ongoing anxiety, etc), then get in touch with the Disability Resource Centre (DRC) and get a Disability Access Plan. Do this right at the start of your studies so it's there if and when you need it. I only found out I qualified for this in my final year of study but it has made this year just that little bit easier.\n2. The DRC can also connect you with free (short term) psychological support and counselling. Access it if you need it!\n3. Seriously, if you live with any learning difficulties, mental health issues, or any other invisible disabilities, contact the DRC and see how they can support you.\n\nEdit: It's actually called the DRC, but I originally called it the DSO. Fixed in the body of the post but can't change it in the title. Apologies for the confusion; Deakin has so many 3 letter acronyms for various offices and services.",

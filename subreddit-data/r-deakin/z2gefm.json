    "postText": "Hi all! I\u2019m an incoming international student at Deakin in 2023. I\u2019m new to Melbourne and just wondering whether y\u2019all can help me out with some advice/suggestions on good areas to live around Deakin Burwood? \n\nI\u2019m 25yoF and ideally looking for a safe area that\u2019s max 10-15 min walk from the campus.\n\nWould Burwood, Box Hill, Surrey hill, Hawthorn suburbs be a good place to start looking? Or would you recommend staying central near Fitzroy/Carlton. Any advice on how to go about looking for the right neighbourhood for Deakin students? \n\nIdeally what time- frame should I start looking? Early December? Early Jan? Planning to move in by Mid-Feb! \n\nYour help is very appreciated and thanks for taking out time to read this\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc95",

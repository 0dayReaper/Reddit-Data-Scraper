    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm an international student doing my Bachelor of Computer Science at Deakin University. My grades have been pretty good so far in the 2 sems I've completed. I've got 5 HDs and 2 Ds. \n\nI was wondering if there are good chances of landing an internship from here? \n\nI've heard that students from Deakin don't get too many internships in the IT industry, is that true?\n\nThanks a lot.",

But my understanding is that wether or not you do an internship is up to you and how much work you put in. Ie resume, cover letter, interviews and applications etc. it would be rare to just be given an internship without all of that work and they are competitive",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nHas anyone studied a postgrad diploma (1 year) of Nutrition at Deakin? I'm a science grad trying to get into med but also have an interest in nutrition.\n\nJust wondering if anyone has experience with this degree as I have spoken to some (non-deakin) students who had some negative sentiments about nutrition education in general being outdated etc.\n\nAlso, how hard is it to get good scores? Although I have an interest in nutrition, I would like to maintain my grades up so as to not significantly impact my chances of getting into med school in the future.\n\nThanks for your help!",

            "comment": "Hi, I had to make the same decision last year, after graduating from biomed. I ended up going for a bachelors of nutrition science instead of the grad dip. My reasoning was the bachelors would help me replace more than 1 year of grades, I was told undergraduate assessments were generally easier than post graduate, also there is csp, so it would be cheaper. I find nutrition interesting, but my end goal is to boost my wam/gpa, so I haven't really noticed any info being outdated.",

Basically got an assessment every week, some weeks got multiple, because most units don't have an exam, unlike biomed where every unit had an exam, so there would only be like 1-2 assignments per unit. I'm also only doing 3 units per tri, and even then I study alot more than I did in biomed. The only benefit is you get an extra week of holidays at the end.",

Apparently doing a Bachelor of Science previously with chem and biochem units doesn't grant me RPL for SLE133, not looking forward to that again. Hats off to you for redoing it! I assume you did some chem units too in biomed.\n\nHave you thought of overloading at all? Or is it simply not feasible in this course in your opinion?",

It was my strongest unit from biomed, so I wouldn't have minded redoing it, but deakin doesn't allow you to redo units. And yes I did sle133, chemistry for a professional science, and biochem. But only needed sle133 for my current course. Um I personally wouldn't overload, I was struggling with 3 units, definitely wouldn't have been able to do 4 or more in a tri. The main issue is there is no exams, so they try to give you as many assignments as possible, so the teaching weeks are ridiculous. Got assessments almost every week, sometimes 2 a week, and this is just with 3 units.",

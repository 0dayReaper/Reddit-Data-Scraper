I thought I would start a new thread to collect all of the discord servers/ social channels relevant to our Deakin community for new users to find in the future.\n\nPlease feel free to post your Deakin-related discord server, WhatsApp group, facebook group, club, society, blog, social channel, or whatever here.\n\nOr if you are a member of another Aussie uni-related subreddit that you think needs some extra love, signal boost it here",

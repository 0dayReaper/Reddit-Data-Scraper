I've seen lots of praise about the quality of online learning on reddit but when I've looked on other websites the uni seems to get bagged a bit more.\n\nJust wondering if anyone has done any online arts courses they could share with me?",

Especially for arts (my degree is arts/education) where it's mainly report and essay writing, where the teaching experience is based around readings, lectures/classes, and seminars",

            "comment": "My boyfriend is doing year 1 optometry and based on what he has told me, it is a lot of work. He does 8ish hours a week on watching lectures and spends 3 hours minimum a day studying. A lot of the lectures you have to pre watch before the actual class time because you apply the knowledge or further discuss it. This doesn't include the large amount of assessment you're given such as prac reports after every prac etc.\nHe switched into the course after a year of the bachelor of paramedicine (7.0 GPA) and also did VCE Chem which helps a lot because he can spend more time on the optics classes.  \nHe would only recommend the course if you actually know how to study as the work will pile up pretty quickly. \nBottom line - it's hard. \nOf course, if you're interested in optometry don't get too dissuaded because if you enjoy the coursework the study shouldn't be too hard for you. \nIn regards to the trimester thing, in optom, you are required to do all 3 tris with 4 units (or 2 equivalent really big units as you get later into your degree) every trimester. So you don't really get much of a break.",

That being said, I'd actually recommend he take it easier right now, because he will burn himself out once it hits the actual content. It depends on the person, but optics is fairly straightforward whereas the coming years will be nothing but memorisation and running a tightrope between all the hurdle requirements of the course.",

Words can't begin to describe how miserable it is. None of the graduates I know have anything positive to say about the experience. There is a lot of study - you will barely have enough time to finish your lectures unless you're a savant, and definitely not enough time to digest them before the slew of assignments, PBLs and placements. Let's hope you remember enough for your OSCE's. ATAR entry was something like 95+ to get in, although word on the street is that there's at least a thousand applicants every year and a bit less than 10% gets in. Youth Allowance can cover a lot of rent depending on parental income. Nearly all graduates get a job upon graduation, but here's the caveat: most people will get snapped up by Specsavers. Mostly because of Specsavers' ridiculous growth rate and their quantity over quality approach, but partially because of the stigma Deakin has as the new kid on the block. Specsavers is a totally separate issue though, so DM me if you have any questions about them.\n\n[I STRONGLY recommend you check out this reply from a graduate](https://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/aiksod/comment/et1un9f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). It's 3 years old but just as relevant, and I can that everything mentioned is true. The unofficial \"fail rate\" (which the academics hilariously refute as \"just misinformation\" despite the *coincidentally* consistent 1 in 6 fail rate of the past 3 cohorts) of OSCEs have gone up to 16% of late - and you have to do 3 of them. This course is very easy to fail. Something like 50-60% of each commencing cohort can expect to repeat at least one year. Mostly from OSCEs exams, but also from placements and the hurdle requirements. I know someone who was 20 minutes late to a placement because of traffic (and the ridiculous standard of the placement starting 15 minutes *before* the allocated time). They failed out of the unit. Not only is it easy to fail though, it also hurts more, because you have to wait a whole year to repeat the unit - no summer courses because of trimesters, and the unit only comes once a year.\n\nFirst year isn't really that hard. 2nd year is when the thumbscrews start getting put on you. That's when your first OSCE shows up. 3rd and 4th year is when your bloodstream becomes mostly cortisol.\n\nTL;DR It's hard, it's **very easy to fail and failing sets you behind a whole year.**",

    "postText": "Hi r/deakin!\n\nThanks for contributing and being a part of our little community. We're a small sub, but steadily growing with each new trimester. We recently just clocked over 2,000 members. Go us! \n\nAs a growing community, we'd love to encourage r/deakin to become a place of active discussion and support for students, staff and alumni of Deakin University. As such, we invite all active sub members to have a say on how you would like the sub to grow, and what features you think would be beneficial (eg. Q&amp;A with faculty members or current students, daily chat topics, different rules, etc). **Please comment below and have your say** \\- all suggestions will be taken into consideration. \n\nAdditionally, we are **still looking for new moderators of** r/deakin. Currently, r/deakin has one active mod, and due to family commitments, I can't keep up with the mod queue on my own anymore (To everyone who has posted recently and have had their post caught in the mod queue, I wholeheartedly apologise!). We're looking for active members who are interested in not only moderating the community, but helping to actively grow this space. No moderating experience necessary - just good communication skills and a bit of your time and ideas. **If you are interested, please send us a modmail!** we'd love to meet you.",

Currently studying bachelor of nursing at waterfront.\nI\u2019ve had some good experiences with lecturers and administration. I chose to study Deakin due to the good reputation of registered nurses I\u2019ve had experiences with. Facilities are reasonable.",

I have a friend who is with Eastern Health and they have done all their placements within that system and have found it very useful. You'll have placements throughout the entirety of your degree though, so it's good to find a system or area which interests you and supports you well before locking in",

I believe that other universities may offer that, but I believe it\u2019s a good move to work as a healthcare worker while studying to get an insight into the industry and the people who are the backbone of aged care. Certification into personal care services are easy to obtain and is a job in high demand",

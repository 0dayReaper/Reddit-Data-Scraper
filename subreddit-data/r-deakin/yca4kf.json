    "postText": "Hey! \n\nIf you\u2019re Neurodivergent / Disabled and are interested (or know someone who is and might be) in forming a society centred around Neurodivergence primarily, with a secondary focus on Disability issues more broadly, or if you are an abled ally but are intimately familiar with disability, especially Neurodivergence, I\u2019d love to hear from you!\n\nThe aim will be to educate our peers on Neurodivergence, to empower Neurodivergent students through support and advocacy, and to bring to light issues that are a widespread problem throughout educational institutions at all levels, but particularly in higher education, that Neurodivergent students are typically left to confront on their own, and often with poor outcomes.\n\nAs a Neurodivergent student, I\u2019ve felt disappointed with the lack of services and have often felt disenfranchised with the inadequate \u201cofferings\u201d of supports that are typically blanket adjustments or accommodations that don\u2019t always address the issue(s) we are facing at that particular time. \n\nThis society will be about giving a voice to the most marginalised minority group at Deakin, and making sure that Neurodivergent and other disabled students needs are acknowledged and rights upheld. \n\nDeakin\u2019s Neurodivergent Association (DNA) will be run by Neurodivergent / Disabled, for Neurodivergent / Disabled.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in helping get us off the ground, let me know! \n\nThanks!",

I have too felt very disenfranchised by the way the uni \u2018accommodates\u2019 neurodivergent people - I won\u2019t go into personal details otherwise here, but it is definitely a shared experience.\n\nDefinitely feel free to PM. I\u2019m keen :-)",

I am also an Autistic-ADHD\u2019er. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re facing similar barriers and discrimination but hopefully this will be the beginning of change for Neurodivergent and other Disabled students so that our rights are respected and upheld. Will PM you soon.",

I value my Reddit anonymity but if you posted a signup form here and in other social channels (Facebook groups, Discord) I'd be one of hopefully more than 20 who would fill it in :)",

I think I remember reading that we only need 3 executive members to form the society, but I haven\u2019t read through the entire start-up guide yet so I may not have gotten up to that part if its still a requirement. That\u2019d be great if we could get more than 20 members to sign up! Thanks for the support!",

Whether those *specific* people do or not isn't really checked, but then the next step is actually getting a certain number of signups by a certain date once you have initial approval - part of which is based on showing that enough students would be willing to join.\n\nDUSA gives new clubs grants ($500 when I was involved) so imagine how many questionable \"clubs\" would be started if there wasn't such a requirement.\n\nTL;DR You can't just start a society of three people through DUSA, you have to show you can form an exec team *and* have a potential membership base beyond the exec team.\n\n(Disclaimer: This is based on a couple of years ago, I haven't checked if anything has changed.)",

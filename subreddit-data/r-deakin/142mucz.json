I\u2019m kinda torn between going to Sydney and Melbourne (those 2 cities fit me well) and going to WSU or Deakin to study. As far as I know, Deakin outranks WSU in terms of both overall rankings and Business School rankings. The tuition fee for both is nearly the same (37k and 32k), but I\u2019m still curious to see whether which school has a better BuAnalytics programme and offers more supports for students.\nI really appreciate your advices\nThank you!",

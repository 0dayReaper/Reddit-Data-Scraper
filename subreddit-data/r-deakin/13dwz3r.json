    "postText": "Hi all! \n\nI'm thinking of applying for the mid year honours intake at Deakin (because they seem to be the only mid year-intake for psychology honours that can be done online). I plan to do a masters at a different university afterwards. I understand that mid year intake means the honours year ends up taking 1.5 years instead because you need to do the research project in the next year, but im finding it difficult to get work and I'm bored doing nothing, so might as well start this year right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo anyway, for those who have recently finished your honours year, how did you find the units and teaching? In particular I'm curious about HPS433 - Applied Counselling Skills (Advanced) and HPS431 - Principles of Psychological Assessment (i.e., the non-statistics units, because I imagine theyre basically the same at any uni), but all feedback is welcome.  \n\nAdditionally, for anyone who studied psych honours online, could you share your experiences? Thank you for your time.",

I did my Honours in Geelong at the Waterfront campus (Grad Dip theoretically in Melbourne, but practically completely online due to Covid). I liked that the group was small, it made it feel less competitive (it's still quite competitive as you need to do well to get into masters, but I've heard it's a lot worse in bigger unis). Again, the professors were very approachable both during the seminars and before/after. The only thing is that the lectures were pre-recorded, but it allowed me to work almost full-time while studying full-time as I was able to choose when to study more freely than if I had tu attend lectures at a particular time. Overall, I think it depends on the professors a lot, I was very lucky to have professors that wanted to discuss practical things outside of the scope of the textbooks and share experience. I really loved those seminars.",

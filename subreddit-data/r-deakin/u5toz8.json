I'd be looking to study online and wondered whether anyone had any experience in this course? Is it worth it? Has it helped anyone get a job in a related field? Able to be done part time while still working full time? Any comments would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!",

You\u2019ll find quite a few working professionals in the course so you\u2019ll be in good company. I\u2019ve not done IT but generally, as with all degrees, you\u2019ll get out of it what you put in. Make use of the career services (eg. DeakinTALENT) while you\u2019re studying to transition your career. It will really set you apart\u2026 because just having a qualification doesn\u2019t equal getting a job unfortunately",

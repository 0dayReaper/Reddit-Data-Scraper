            "comment": "hi i actually has the exact same comparison when deciding on my uni pathway as well - i was considering nursing and psychology at either deakin or QUT. i am actually from queensland so QUT was more convenient for me as i wouldn\u2019t have to move states, however after doing some research into both unis, i ended up deciding on deakin and started the course this year. it\u2019s only been one semester however i really recommend deakin it\u2019s a great uni and it\u2019s nursing department is specifically great and offers a quality hands on experience. the first year mostly focusses on nursing so i haven\u2019t had much experience with psychology- just one subject (foundation psych) but i also found it to be really great as well. QUT is very innovative in their teaching though and they are also a great university for psychology, however i don\u2019t know how good their nursing program is, but it\u2019s a great uni overall and the environment is amazing.\nas someone who was in the exact same position and compared both for a long time before deciding, i couldn\u2019t recommend deakin enough. good luck with your decision and all the best with whichever you decide. hope i helped :)",

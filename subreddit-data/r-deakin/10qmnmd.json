I feel like it's as good as I can get it, but a couple of others I have asked have said I need to put at the top of the statement addressing someone. Any advice for me?",

Or if it's a group: Dear Members of Name Panel/Committee/Society/etc. If I can't find out (particularly by asking around), I use To Whom it May Concern, Dear Recipient of this Letter/Statement/Inquiry, etc., and depending on the degree of formality required. Hope that helps. Good luck with your application.",

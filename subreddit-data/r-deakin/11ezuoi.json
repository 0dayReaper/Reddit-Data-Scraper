I don't know where to find my reading list for my course, i don't know what i'm going to meet in terms of course work, i feel confused about the videos i have to watch before classes start this upcoming Monday, and i don't know what to do.",

            "comment": "I found joining the faculty peer mentoring sessions really useful in my first year. Just google \u201cDeakin peer mentoring\u201d they usually run weekly drop in sessions hosted by a fellow student who has done well and has the capacity to help guide you in your intro to university life. \n\nTry to remember you\u2019re not alone, many of the other first year students probably feel exactly what you\u2019re feeling. The unit chairs understand this and don\u2019t expect you to know anything in the first week, most of their lectures and seminars will begin with talking you through how to access everything and where to get help. Deakin is very supportive and they genuinely want you to succeed so don\u2019t be afraid to ask from help. If you are on campus, you will see lots of \u201cStudent Central\u201d zones, drop in and ask them anything you like, they are there to help you. \n\nLastly, if you are attending campus classes, go in early, download a map on your phone and try to find your class ahead of start time just to alleviate that stress. You will probably get lost a few times but we all have :) enjoy your studies and this new exciting chapter, it will all fall into place and you will be a pro by the mid trimester break.",

    "postText": "Hello to my fellow sufferes of essays and debt. I'm a Criminology and Criminal Justice graduate looking to do another undergrad in the health sector. I wanted opinions on which you think is the better option. I was either going to do\"\n\nBA-Public Health and Health Promotion/Commerce (HR management) (4 year degree)\n\nOR\n\nBA-Health Sciences majoring in Public Health, Health Promotion and Environmental Health (3 year degree)\n\nI was interested to hear from both graduates and current undergrads thoughts on the above. I should mention I have a special interest in epidemiology.\n\nThanks for your time :)",

    "postText": "Welcome to r/deakin! You might have found yourself here if you are a new student, or want to be a part of the wider Deakin community. We are a small community but we love to help.\n\nTo cut down on recurring standalone self-posts asking the same question in our sub, we ask that all requests for enrolment support, questions about troubleshooting and new student help be posted in this megathread. This helps posts that encourage community-wide discussion to flourish, and ensures that you get the quick answers you need from the community here. \n\nTo help get you started, here are some links to help answer frequently asked questions:\n\n* [Accept your offer](https://www.deakin.edu.au/choose)\n* [How to enrol](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/enrolment-fees-and-money/enrolments/how-to-enrol)\n* [More help - everything to do with enrolling](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/enrolment-fees-and-money/enrolments)\n* [Get help from a student adviser](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/help/student-central)\n* [Choose your units - in the handbook](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/enrolment-fees-and-money/university-handbook)\n* [Accomodation](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/your-campus/accommodation)\n* [Timetables](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/enrolment-fees-and-money/enrolments/star)\n* [Fees](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/enrolment-fees-and-money/fees)\n* [IT Help](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/help/it-help)\n* [More!](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students)\n\n[Student Central](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/help/student-central) is your starting point for help with information and access to a wide range of services at Deakin. If you are having trouble enrolling, chances are you will need to chat with someone from Student Central who can help you. \n\nWe also welcome discussion from the wider community. If you have other questions or topics on your mind, feel welcome to post here, and if you see someone ask a question that you've found the answer to - pay it forward! \n\nJoin us on discord:\n\n* [First Year's Discord server](https://discord.gg/KyKcKAEM2t)\n* [Deakin Uni Discord](https://discord.gg/Xf5CBexK8G)\n* [Engineering Discord](https://discord.gg/NugKM7f)\n* [Deakin e-Sports Association](https://discord.gg/Q5wtTZf)",

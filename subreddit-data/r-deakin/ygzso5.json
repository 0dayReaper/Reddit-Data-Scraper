    "postText": "Hi, I'm considering doing HSH216 as an elective to boost my wam. I did do Epidemiology and Biostatistics 1, and did quite well in it, but I did it precovid, so it's been a few years. I was just wondering if this unit covers all the required content, and in terms of difficulty, is it similar to Epidemiology and Biostatistics 1? Thanks",

I did well in epi 1 and biostats 1 as well but the grading was so much more unpredictable with epi 2 given my assignments were designing a questionnaire, group presentation and writing a paper (other people were complaining how strict the marking was). Biostats 2 was a lot more complicated and IMO made much less sense than biostats 1. So assuming it\u2019s the same as HSH216 , and just based on my experience, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for boosting wam as they brought my down.",

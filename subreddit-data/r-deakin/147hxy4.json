Currently looking into pursuing master degree at Deakin however i have some questions wanting your opinions. I am interested in pursuing master of professional accounting and master of counselling and want to know whether i can pursue the two degrees at the same time as double degree study option? Besides that, I am welcoming your opinions on both degrees based on your experience and future career outcomes.",

            "comment": "Contacting deakin directly would provide the most reliable answer, unless they have it listed it's probably unlikely to be the case.  \n\n\nCounselling is complicated, it's an unprotected title in Australia so anyone can claim to be a counsellor. However, certain bodies do exist such as ACA (Australian Counselling Association) that offer memberships and accreditation guidelines [https://www.theaca.net.au/index.php](https://www.theaca.net.au/index.php)   \n\n\nI will mention counselling is an easier career pathway to get into, you'll earn less than a psychologist but you'll also not need to study for anywhere near the same amount of time and may find it easier to get work. If you don't intent to be a counsellor in AUS I would recommend checking your desired country's regulations, same goes for Accounting though I'm fairly certain Deakin's courses are accredited for Accounting.",

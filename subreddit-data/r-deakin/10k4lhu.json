Basically I didn't pay my graduation fee straight away because I was waiting for my pay to come in. At the same time I ended up going through a death in my family and completly forgot about it. The request has been denied to graduate and I've emailed them to explain the circumstances. Do you think I have a chance? I know at the end of the day its my fault rip",

Deakin will need to finalise things like testamurs, academic regalia, grad books / printing so if there\u2019s a firm cut off for these things, sneaking you through might not be an option (for context I work for Uni\u2019s). Keep your head up, you will be able to graduate in the next round which is June. Given what you\u2019ve been through, graduating in June might be a better option while the dust settles. The late grad fee for feb is pretty rough too ($275).",

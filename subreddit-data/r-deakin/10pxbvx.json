So, no, it\u2019s not a requirement to have taken HBS107 in order to take HSH105.\n\nDesirable means it would be better if you were currently or had previously taken HBS107 to get the most out of HSH105. For example, maybe there are topics or foundational principles they discuss in HBS107 that makes it easier to understand the content taught in HSH105.",

HSH105, that you want to do, focuses on a smaller health aspect: the family.\n\nSo the unit chairs are saying that you will understand HSH105 *better* if you also have the knowledge from HBS107.",

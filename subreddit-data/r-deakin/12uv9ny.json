    "postText": "Hi all. I'm doing my Honours year, but I stuffed up my enrolment and neglected to add the thesis subject. I thought i did, but it somehow wasnt added (lesson learnt). For anyone not aware, it's not a content subject with any contact hours or assignments, it's just for ticking off you're working on the thesis. I've been doing the work, so I'm fully up to date with everyone else. \n\nI tried to alter my enrolment to add it in but census had passed and I was told no (this was through asking my supervisor who asked the admin to look into it). My intention now is to make a change of enrolment for next semester enabling me to enrol in *both* thesis components for Tri 2, meaning I graduate in 2023. As it is now, this mistake means my graduation would be pushed back a whole year. I'm new at Deakin, and came from a university where such a change of enrolment was fairly routine so long as you could prove it was reasonable to do the work necessary (in this case, there is no extra work). I'm a little knocked by the fact that this mistake (admittedly stupid, I had been going through some medical issues that contributed) is going to delay me a whole year. Does anyone have an experience doing something similar or know who I can contact/what I can do to resolve this? Any help or advice greatly appreciated. I really don't want to have this hanging over my head!",

I don't think you're going to find anyone who is doing honours here yet. The community is yet to grow on reddit. I had issues in getting exemptions for some first year units of my course and had to communicate with a specific student services department relevant to my bachelors.",

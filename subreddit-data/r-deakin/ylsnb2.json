    "postText": "Hi everyone, my friend is in the last year of uni. She just has one unit left. Recently, one of her unit result is withheld due to academic misconduct investigation on an assignment. Does anyone know how long  the investigation will take? And if the allegation is proven, what is likely the consequence? Since it\u2019s her first offense, will she get suspended or excluded? Her overall grade is pretty good, will the faculty take it into consideration?",

    "postText": "(When we're not being assaulted by COVID-19)\n\nHey. I'm a 24 year-old Aussie local looking at going to Uni next year. I'm in a somewhat unique position in that I've been, for lack of a better term, a basement dweller for the last few years. Usual story - depression, anxiety, etcetera. So I've very little experience with people or life in general frankly. I dunno if I'm too old to live on campus, though emotionally I tend to fit in a lot better with slightly younger people over my own age group.\n\nWas hoping uni could help me get out of my shell while building some career potential. Planning to move out of home and a year on-campus seems like a nice idea. Anyone have experience with this? Or second-hand testimonies, at least?",

The only complaint she had was it was a little bit out of the way so she needed to drive if she wanted to go anywhere but Burwood campus is nice and close to everything and there\u2019s a tram stop out the front that will take you to the Melbourne CBD.",

If you want to stay on campus stay on campus. If you're uncomfy with sharing you can probably request to have a single or double bedroom unit.\n\nThe description seems really standard for student accoms, there will be lots of social opportunities to bond with people.\n\nFrom what I've seen from emails the student services at Deakin seem to reply very quickly (like 2-3 days) so I guess that could be an indication of how supportive they are. \n\nProbably different for you but what I've found is just be yourself and learn some social skills steps if they help you (I have Asperger's I didn't know there's a particular way to communicate until like last year), though I find that once you're acquaintances with someone and you trust them, it is ok to be yourself with them.",

            "comment": "I lived on Res for 4 months last year and couldn't wait to get out. I was 20 when I moved and everyone in my flat was 18 and in their first year. I barely talked to anyone in my flat, only really when we were cooking at the same time. There were a few parties but everyone who went seemed to know each other already so I felt very excluded. The actual accommodation is of a good standard, aside from having at least two fire alarms a week and a kitchen that's as hot as hell in the summer. Honestly, I wouldn't go for it. It's nice to be a short walk from classes but I don't think it's worth it for the loneliness I felt those few months. Find a student house in Burwood so you can walk or get the tram in (I've heard parking is a nightmare). If you have any other questions feel free to ask!",

                    "comment": "Hi, while living on res I noticed a few mature age students, but they mostly stuck together. This applies for almost every group of friends as no one really wanted to branch out. As a pretty shy person myself, I felt very lonely living in the studio rooms, so I challenged myself to change to a 5-rooms shared flat. I was very close to my roommates and we still talk even after moving out. But from what I've heard, people either hated their experience or absolutely loved it. \n\nAnd yes, the rules can be very restrictive and made me feel underaged again, but the parties still went on nonetheless. It was impossible to know what events and parties were being held and I felt excluded at times if it weren't for my roommates to invite me. Also, if you are serious about studies, these loud parties that can happen whenever and wherever can be very frustrating. \n\nRes does have residential leaders for every floor to help new residents socialise, but even the nicest residential leaders wouldn't help much as they were busy partying every week. I had a good time at res with my roommates and some friends from high-school who also lived there, but it was impossible personally to make any new friends.",

I did try to make friends with my flatmates and others I met at parties but it never stuck. Not just for me either, the majority of the people I knew through the international exchange program had the same issues.\n\nI also just remembered how restrictive the rules were on Res. You weren't allowed to play drinking games, one time a security guard actually watched us through the window so he could catch people playing cards. During the exam period you weren't allowed to have any guests or even meet your friends on Res, unless it was for study. Alcohol was banned during this period too. If you wanted guests over you would have to apply for them to be approved and they could only stay for 2 nights. I was 20 years old and felt like I was living at a boarding school. Really bad vibes.",

Guess I'll have to accept I've missed the boat on that one. Will look into off-campus accommodation. Hopefully those people aren't too harsh on a guy being shy and awkward at my age.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone!   \n\n\nI'm applying to Deakin University for an MBA. More likely than not, I can expect myself to have an offer letter come in. Therefore, I wanted to know more about the quality of education from students themselves. I wanted to understand how the course are gone for the alumni, has the university had any positive impact on your career? And the general.   \n\n\nPlease help me out with this. Thank you in advance.",

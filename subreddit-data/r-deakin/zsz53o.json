    "postText": "decided the horror show of reviews for off campus student living might not be ideal and i might have to bite the bullet and live in a room the size of my current bathroom. \n\ncan anyone give feedback about living on campus particularly in the shared apartment. and please no try off campus accommodation in a share house comments because im 18 and live + work regionally atm so no one wants me \ud83d\ude2d (i do have funds saved for around 1-2 months rent and a bond)\n\ni\u2019ve gone for living with same gender and preference same course. particularly curious in the mandating of students by security or whatever? like the strict rules? reminds me a bit of high school camps.\n\n\nim aware the price is bogus for what you get but look if it includes all my bills and unlimited wifi i genuinely can\u2019t complain in comparison to every other option. i also believe im eligible for the scholarship so may be my cheapest option.",

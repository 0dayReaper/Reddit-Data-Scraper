If I drop out can I come back?\nAny guidance would be great :)",

We get so many students who don\u2019t really want to be there but feel like they have to enrol - they often struggle with motivation and get pretty poor grades because it\u2019s just not what they want to be doing. They\u2019re often stressed and miserable about it too, and end up with a hefty debt and don\u2019t learn much because they were never really interested. If you really don\u2019t want to go, then don\u2019t put yourself through that. Life\u2019s too short - do something you enjoy instead. You can always come back later if you decide you do want to study (we have heaps of older students who waited until they felt ready or knew for sure what they wanted to do). If you\u2019re unsure if you want to study or not, think about the advice others here have suggested to enrol in one or two courses to see what it\u2019s like and then withdraw before census date if you decide it\u2019s not for you.",

I did uni for 2 years of uni immediately after high school and thought to myself wouldn\u2019t it be great to take a \u201cgap year\u201d. That gap year turned into a 7 year gap and I just started going back to finally get the degree. Mind you I\u2019ve swapped like 3 courses during this period. Safe to say it\u2019s always good to have a degree because you will realise most businesses do prefer applicants with formal tertiary education - ie. your finance, marketing, medicine, IT etc roles. You get the gist. Nevertheless, if you don\u2019t want one of these roles and would like to work in a role that requires no tertiary education - sales, retail, hospitality then go for it. Only you can make that decision for yourself. Education will never leave you and that\u2019s something you can frame on the wall until you die :)",

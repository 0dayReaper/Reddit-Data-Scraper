The rough schedule that the placement provider has given me is pretty full on - Am i expected to attend uni at the same time? Or just catch up and stay up to date with all my assignments?\n\nTIA",

But the placements supervisor should know this and work with you to make it work.\n\nFor example I did my placement with a football team and as long as we let them know far enough in advance they didn't care if we missed one or multiple training sessions to do an assignment, prepare for exams etc.",

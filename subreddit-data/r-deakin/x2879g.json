    "postText": "Hi, I'm currently in my 1st/2nd year of nutrition science, and am studying 3 units a tri. I'm trying to graduate with a 85 wam so thought it would be good to balance out my units, doing harder units with relatively easier units. \nThe units that I plan on doing over the next 2 years are HSN315, HSN301, HSN105, HSN202, HSN302, HSN106, HSN309, HSN206 and HSN305. I was wondering which of these units were easier to do well, and which of these required more work (more theory/more assignments/harder assignments). Thanks",

I'm hoping to spread these units out, so I don't have multiple stuff due almost every week.",

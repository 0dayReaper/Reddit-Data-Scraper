    "postText": "My dream is to work as a research scientist in a world renowned pharmaceutical organization, like Pfizer. My interests are medicinal chemistry and human diseases, hence I chose this degree. I received a final offer and I want to make sure that I am making the right choice. After completing this degree, I hope to continue my study towards an honors year in pharmaceutical science. After this I hope to pursue a masters degree and then a PHD in my field of study. So, I wanted to know if this degree will prepare me for my future goal or is it waste of time?\n\nHope someone can help",

            "comment": "My partner and I both completed biomed this degree at RMIT about a decade ago. Things may have changed in the years since (and deakin may be different to RMIT) but here are a couple of points I can make.\n\nThe field if study is interesting and does open the doors to alot of opportunities.\nThe industry is a big industry but a small industry, make a good impression with EVERYONE you meet because if you don't, word will get around.\nRMIT does a placement program, I do not know if Deakin also does this, but the placement program is a great way to get into the industry.\nIf you are looking to get into drug development, you will need the PhD.\nIf you want to work for a large drug company, BMS, CSL and GSK are the only real options in Victoria (although there are lots of small ones), and they dont all do the type of work you may be envisioning in Victoria, there are much more in NSW so begin considering if an interstate move is something you would be open to",

Thank you for informing me about the placement program because previously I wasn't aware of it. I will try my best to get a placement as it can open up many opportunities, as you mentioned. In your opinion, which offer should I accept, the one from deakin or RMIT?",

From experience, a good portion of the students who do the placement, get a job at the company they did placement for (and those that didn't were able to get jobs fairly easily).",

Because of the incredibly diverse backgrounds of people, there is no primary form of communication.\n\nThere is one server that's an antivax one, which I've tried to report many times. It seems discord even with its report option and specific harmful misinformation report function, doesn't want to remove it. So just ignore that one, lol.\n\nBest of luck. \ud83d\ude00",

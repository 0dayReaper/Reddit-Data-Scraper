I'm no expert by any means but I'm starting the Master of Teaching (Secondary) this trimester, so I've been spending a lot of time looking at enrolment info the last couple of weeks.\n\n[Here's your course map](https://www.deakin.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2495993/E764-2023-T1-coursemap.pdf)(the full time one at least) which gives you an idea of the order you will do the units in. It looks like you do both at the same time which is cool. \n\nIf you're curious about how this compares to the single primary or early childhood degrees, the course maps are available [here](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/enrolment-fees-and-money/enrolments/course-maps).\n\nThere's also part time maps which are available in the internal student area - DM me if you've already been admitted and I'll send it to you, otherwise contact Student Central (that's where I originally got mine).\n\nGood luck, and if you're starting this year, see you in the core units in trimester 1 :)",

    "postText": "I'm an international student, just accepted into Deakin University for BA/ Masters International Relations with a 25% scholarship. I had also applied for the 100% Merit VC Scholarship which i hope to get. Is the University worth it if I don't the scholarship cause i will be a paying a lot of money otherwise and travelling a very long distance. \n\nPlus what would be my chances of getting the VC Scholarship with 92.4% in my grades and stellar extra curriculars which got me into Universities like Kings College London, University of Glasgow and St. Andrews University? \n\nPlease respond fast cause i have to make a decision soon! Thank you!!",

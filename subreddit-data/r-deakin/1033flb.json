    "postText": "Anyone here enrolled in this course? I am likely to commence this course starting March '23 and I was curious to know certain things. \n\n1) How is the faculty for this course and general life at the uni?\n2) How involved &amp; interactive is the Masters class between themselves as well as the rest of the uni?\n3) The real life application of the things taught in the course\n4) What are some jobs you might pursue during and after the course, and how tough/easy is it to find &amp; achieve (and how helpful are the uni mentors in this aspect)?\n5) Is it a good idea to take up this course if my general area of interest lies in visual communication &amp; design (things that are typically taught in M.Des courses)\n\nIf anyone could take out the time to provide some input I'd be really grateful.\nThanks.",

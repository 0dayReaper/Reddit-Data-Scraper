I would usually see my friends but now its too far and making friends in my building is difficult. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on places to go around Burwood?\n\nThank You.",

We're looking for people with a passion for triple j and music who are already active on reddit and/or r/triplej. Previous mod experience is welcome but not required.\n\nThe recent growth has come from AMAs and other initiatives, and is likely to continue. We're looking forward to someone with a fresh perspective to help continue the growth as well as try new ideas to ensure the sub is a welcoming and lively place for all triple j fans to discuss the radio station.\n\nIf you're interested you can complete the form below so we can understand a bit about you and your interests. Let the mod team know if you have any queries.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxM7G_t83ZZIArKrtVrRPm9mmIqvrmAl_ToBXDf79cCbZU3g/viewform?usp=sf_link",

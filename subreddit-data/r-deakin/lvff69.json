The problem with the degree is you aren't really qualified for a job outside of a lab technician post graduating,  as opposed to say a student who studies accounting &gt; (becomes an accoutant). So what does this mean? Well, you have to be comitted to doing a form of post-graduate study to really specialise in an area, because honestly this degree is more of a stepping stone to further study. You won't even be looked at for any Research assistant or medical lab work (minimum masters) so be ready to add another 2+ years ontop of you degree to get anything solid.\n\nMind you, if medicine is your goal I guess this degree is probably your best bet. That being said, as mentioned we had 140 graduates from solely Deakin in 2020. Worst case scenario you don't get into med, you now are not only up against that many graduates, you're also competing against others graduatres from Melbourne, Monash, VU, ACU trying to make it in the job market.\n\nMy advice is please please please KNOW the direct pathway you want to go after finishing your degree, and talk/ask/get an idea from people on what it's like working in that area.",

Because my course as you know is biomed and I\u2019m majoring in medical genomics and I kid you not, i don\u2019t know one single person who\u2019s also doing a major in genomics. Like everyone that I know is majoring in immunity, and I\u2019m like wow there no one doing med genomics!",

I had the same experience being alone studying my major STEM if not the only person doing it. Initially I thought Infection and immunity would suit what I wanted to do, however, I really didn't enjoy haemetology and disease research, so I changed to Environmental health (which i'm so glad i did, 100% enjoyed way more and will most likely will pursue accreditation to become a qualified EHO at Swinburne).\n\nAs for the stats on genetics degree and genetics graduates im not 100% certain, although, I do know that reading through Research assistant/jobs/positions in general there seems to be an advantage if you have come from genetic studied background. Futhermore, considering the importance of genetic makeup in virtually everything there is also lot of potential of research projects in that area.",

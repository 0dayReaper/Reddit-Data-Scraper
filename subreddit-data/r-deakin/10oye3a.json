    "postText": "Hi, I am a prospective domestic student at Deakin.\n\nBackground: I am 40yrs old, 2 kids and wife, currently working fulltime, with a Utilties company for the last 10 years.\n\nI currently have an Advanced Diploma in Power Systems: Electrical and Power Transmission.\n\nI am wanting to further my study, and it seems Deakin has the only offering of an Electrical Engineering Degree via an online platform.  \n\n\nCan anyone who has/ is studied/studying via the cloud campus option able to priovide your experience with the delivery and platform?  Have you found it a challenege? Do you feel well supported?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from the advertised fees for the course, what are some of the hidden costs associated with the Bachelor of Electrical Engineering(Honours) course?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow much 'real time' studying, project, or classwork do you find yourself committing each week to the course? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there much of a difference starting in the first intake, compared to the mid year intake?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is expected for the Honours part of the Degree?",

            "comment": "I did mechatronics, not electrical, but one of the 'hidden' costs would be the intensive weeks if you aren't a local student. Not every unit has an activity for intensive week, so you may only have to go on campus for a day or two at a time, but that's flights and accommodation to account for.",

I couldn't be happy with the delivery, all the subjects have 1 x 2 hour live class where they review the weekly content and then do a problem question so we can practice applying the content. \n\nAll questions about the content and subject admin go on a discussion board which is typically responded to in max 2 days, most of the time someone has already asked the question and you can read the answer. \n\nAll content is quite progressive and I don't really find myself asking questions on the content but rather questions of assessment instructions. \n\nThe content can be worked through at your own pace and all the live classes are recorded so can  be watched at more convenient times if needed. \n\nI find the cloud such an effective way of studying and couldn't imagine going on campus as I barely have enough time as it is. Also the commute/finding study spots/not having my 3 monitors would lead to inefficiencies and wasted time.",

Trimester 3 is compulsory and I opted to do it this year just to get 1 big unit out of the way and honestly not feeling any burnout. If you chose not to do tri 3 you\u2019d have a break from like October-February which is more than enough I think\n\nYou also have the intra trimester breaks which are a week off at about week 5, they\u2019re also good, if you keep on top of everything the first half of the trimester you can actually have a week off instead of playing catch up.\n\nAll in all, plenty of breaks throughout the teaching period.\n\nCan\u2019t help with the optometry course though unfortunately.",

    "postText": "I am looking to undertake an interesting elective unit and was wondering if anyone who has taken acv101 can shed some light on it? How well is it taught, what do the seminars entail, and how heavy the workload.\n\nFor context, I am towards the end of my bachelor of law/arts and was looking to use my elective to take a subject completely different to my major. I am not necessarily looking for an easy HD, but also want to make sure I am not enrolling in a unit too far out of my depth.\n\nThanks in advance!",

You will learn to paint if you want to. It is not a bludge subject because you kind of need to put a lot of effort into keeping a visual diary and creating artworks, plus there\u2019s some written assignments - but it is first year level so it\u2019s not hard - just a time commitment. The other thing to mention is the cost - you\u2019ll need to buy art supplies but if you enjoy art I would say go for it because you will keep using them :)",

Regarding the art supplies part thankfully I engage in art as a hobby so have quite a lot of brushes and different types of paint, so if anything the unit would be a good excuse to add to my collection! \n\nDo you know what the seminars are like, or were like when you took the unit? Just so I know what I am in for!",

You will enjoy it I think. \n\nThe seminars were fairly informal when I was taking the unit, a bit of a mix between art history and learning about styles and art movements and practical techniques\u2026 to the more practical review process of your work. If you\u2019ve kept a visual diary before and done project-like art work before, you won\u2019t have problems. Just doing a bit each day kind of thing. But again, this was ages ago and unit content changes all the time so YMMV. \n\nI can see that the unit chair is Simon - he is great. Grumpy if you don\u2019t do your work but check out his artwork, he\u2019s an amazing painter and a good teacher.",

    "postText": "Hi, I am a former Deakin student, and I'm making YouTube videos teaching first-year microeconomics. The subject code back when I did it was MAE101 Economics Principles. I have made 3 videos so far, and aim to make at least 1 a week. Ideally, they will take you right through the entire course. They are under half the length of a uni lecture because I cut out a lot of the \"fluff\" content I viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to core content you will need to do well.  \nI still advise you to attend classes and lectures, especially your classes.   \nI hope someone finds this useful. I did extremely well in economics and would like to help others as well.\n\nMicroeconomics - Lecture 1 - Trade - Oppotunity Cost: [https://youtu.be/ms\\_05tJCkGw](https://youtu.be/ms_05tJCkGw) \n\nMicroeconomics - Class 1 - Trade - Oppotunity Cost - Tade Offs: [https://youtu.be/I\\_4I0W9u0fs](https://youtu.be/I_4I0W9u0fs)\n\nMicroeconomics - Lecture 2 - Demand and Supply - Markets: [https://youtu.be/1bjP47BEfLo](https://youtu.be/1bjP47BEfLo)  \n\n\nRegards, Clinton Lee",

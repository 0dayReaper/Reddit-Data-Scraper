    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI'm a cloud student studying a bachelor of software engineering. As I plan to travel abroad later next year, I would like to complete all the units that require us to attend the intensive week before trimester 2 of next year. However I was not able to find any information about which subjects have this attendance requirement. I have already completed SEJ104 this trimester so my question is, which of the other units have this requirement?\n\nThanks",

The majority of the weekly active learning sessions are recorded so you can watch them in your own time if you are unable to attend and every unit has recorded lectures on the unit site. I personally spent around 30-35 hours a week studying but I'm a full time student and I kind of struggled not having any background knowledge at all and was also aiming for all HDs so I guess the amount of time you spend studying will depend on a whole lot of factors. However, I found that the teaching team were very supportive (besides for SIT102 where I was unlucky and got a tutor who rarely read through my work or offered feedback).",

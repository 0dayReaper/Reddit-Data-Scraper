    "postText": "Having scoured the Deakin Policy Library I cannot find a single policy specifically banning bullying of students by teachers.\n\nYes there is a Workplace bullying policy, which is nice for the staff, they have stuff in place to protect them. \n\nBut what of the students. \n\nI submitted a bullying complaint to the powers that be, spent a great deal of time finding various places throughout all the policies which allude to respectful and non-discriminatory treatment of others at Deakin. But no actual policy which protects Students from being bullied or disrespected by staff.\n\nOf course the complaint instructions required that I demonstrate which Policy in particular the Staff Member has breached/Violated.\n\nAfter a week of allegedly considering all my documentation (which I read to mean, \"we didnt bother opening your file\"), I was summarily gaslit by the powers that be and told that \"We can find no basis to your complaint. We now consider this matter closed\".\n\nHow do I escalate this considering they are not willing to.",

They can help you navigate the system and figure out your next steps. \n\nEven though you can\u2019t find the exact policy you\u2019re hoping to find (and I can\u2019t be bothered looking myself right now), I would say that bullying of deakin students is a huge no no and something the University would take super seriously. It\u2019s hard to know from your post exactly what occurred (and we can\u2019t really be the arbiters of what is and isn\u2019t bullying anyway) but if you\u2019ve already:\n\n* tried talking to your academic\n* tried taking to the unit chair or discipline convenor (or the next higher up)\n* lodged a complaint\n\nThen your next step is to contact the Dean of students or the Victorian ombudsman. Whatever you feel is the most appropriate. \n\nThe process is [here](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/dean-of-students/complaints)",

            "comment": " had a lecturer who was trying to bully me. It was a pretty well known fact in the department, that there were 'issues' between him and me.   \n\n\nThe first assignment, I was marked very harshly compared to the rest of the class. I just went to the Head of the department, showed him, told him things from my side.   \n\n\nHe reviewed my assignment, said I was marked very harshly, and that there are 3 options from here   \n\n\nA) Make it official  \nB) Do nothing  \nC) Trust him and let him have a quiet word with his staff member.   \n\n\nHe recommended option (C), I chose option (C) , from then on I was marked closer to fair, and the harrasment from the lecturer reduced (but didn't stop), but the harrasment from him never bothered me.   \n\n\nFrom my point of View the uni supported me and helped me and I was happy how the situation was handled and managed. I also had proof of a overly hard marked assignment, and a department that was already 'aware' of issue between a staff member and a student.   \n\n\nThis happened in the early 1990's, when bullying was not a big an issue as it is now at a different university.   \n\n\nI would find someone 'senior' staff at the university that you know and trust and talk to them about it.",

I don\u2019t understand your angle. There absolutely is policies against bullying and harassment at deakin, and it\u2019s referenced in the scope of their complaints procedure ([section 3B](https://policy.deakin.edu.au/view.current.php?id=00145)). If a staff member has bullied you, then make a complaint. If the University has deems your complaint frivolous or without merit, and you think that\u2019s incorrect, then escalate it?\n\nETA: [here is another link to Deakin\u2019s stance on bullying](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/health-and-wellbeing/counselling/topics-to-explore/healthy-relationships/bullying-and-cyber-bullying). In there it outlines that you have a right to not be bullied at Deakin. You\u2019d probably have to prove that you were bullied. Did you provide proof?",

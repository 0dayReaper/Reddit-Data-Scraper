I\u2019m a bit scared that this means I\u2019ll fail the unit as it\u2019s my first year here :(\n\nCan anyone tell me what to do please T-T",

Email your unit chair and let them know your circumstances and that you missed a prac. If you have a valid reason for missing it, they might be able to come up with a work-around. Labs are usually on a fortnightly cycle so it might not be too late to catch up.",

I don\u2019t know if that applies to you, but I thought I\u2019d mention it just in case. \nIf it\u2019s a clash with your workplace, and you have a shift at the same time as a prac, that\u2019s something they probably won\u2019t accomodate - you\u2019re expected to make pracs a priority, and they are crucial to developing the applicable lab skills you\u2019re expected to have as a science graduate. However, I thiiiink deakin offers financial support to some students in select circumstances, so if missing a work shift is a significant source of financial stress for you (to the point where it impacts on your studies by causing you to miss pracs) then you might be able to get support. \n\nIf this becomes an ongoing issue, it is highly likely it WILL cause you to fail the unit. I\u2019ve failed units before, due to mental health and ADHD, so, trust me, I understand that sometimes our circumstances are difficult and impede our studies in ways that are hard to control. That being said, you need to take a good serious look at why this problem happened and do everything you can to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.",

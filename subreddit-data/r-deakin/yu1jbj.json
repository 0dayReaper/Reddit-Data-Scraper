    "postText": "Probably a reach as it\u2019s not a very popular course but does anyone do environmental sustainability and management or know anyone doing this course? Currently my first preference (y12 grad this year) as I\u2019m interested in sustainability but I\u2019m unsure of whether the course is enjoyable/viable for many post grad opportunities. Thanks!!",

I have friends who\u2019ve graduated from enviro science degrees who constantly offer me undergraduate roles where they work because they say the industry is that desperate for more people. The environmental space has so much opportunity.",

I\u2019m glad you\u2019re loving it! I\u2019ve had a look at each subject and I\u2019m keen on most of them so I think I\u2019ve settled on this course (at least for now), thankyou for your insight!!",

Reach out to the executives through email: enviroc@deakin.edu.au \nI think they\u2019ll be more than happy to help and tell you about the degree.",

I did speak to some people about the course at the open day earlier this year which sparked my interest but obviously I couldn\u2019t learn about everything in a 5 minute convo so this\u2019ll be helpful :)",

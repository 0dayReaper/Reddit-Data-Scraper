            "comment": "Not all international students need to complete a foundation first. Maybe you haven't met all the entry requirements . Nursing is quite hard to get into regardless the university. I suggest you do your research and contact the international admission officer managing your application. If you are using an education agent please be mindful of them! Too many international trust their agents to do all the work and research, but you don't know if they will provide you incorrect advice. Do your own research and just ask the admissions staff. \n\nIf you are required to do the Foundation, it's not all that bad. It will allow you to adjust to your studies and prepare you for the Bachelor of Nursing. Hope this helps",

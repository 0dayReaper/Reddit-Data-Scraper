We are a small community but we love to help. \n\nTo cut down on recurring standalone self-posts asking the same question, we ask that all requests for enrolment support, questions about troubleshooting and new student help be posted in the megathread. \n\nTo help get you started, here are some links to help answer frequently asked questions:\n\n*[Accept your offer](https://www.deakin.edu.au/choose)\n\n*[How to enrol](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/enrolment-fees-and-money/enrolments/how-to-enrol)\n\n*[Get help from a student adviser](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/help/student-central)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Student Central](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/help/student-central) is your starting point for help with information and access to a wide range of services at Deakin. \n\nIf you see someone ask a question that you've found the answer to - pay it forward!",

It's added an extra 8 units to my degree as I won't be getting RPL for some university credits from 2011  As I'm assuming they are just out of date.  Has anyone had any luck getting them to bend on this?",

I had to ask for one of my credits to be removed as otherwise I would not have had the space to complete all necessary core subjects. \n\nBest of luck this coming year!",

            "comment": "Hiya! I'm a direct applicant to Deakin and I've applied to the Bachelor of Vision Science/Master of Optometry. For context, I'm a NSW tertiary student with a Bachelor of Vision Science from UNSW.\n\nI was wondering if anyone here has experience with pending applications. The direct application offer round for this program was due on the 17th of January; it's now 5 days later and my application is still pending, and I know a few others in the same boat.\n\nI've already emailed back and forth with Admissions and they basically told me that it might be longer than a week because VTAC offers are being processed first, and direct applications later. \n\nI'm getting nervous at how long it might take now, because my other option for optometry (University of Canberra) starts on the 7th of February. I need a response from Deakin really soon so that I know what I need to do. (It's my first time moving interstate!) And I noticed some VTAC applicants on here were offered a spot as early as a week ago... \n\nAnyone familiar with delayed applications at all? Any insight/experience from community members would be appreciated!\n\nTLDR: My direct application to optometry is taking ages. Anyone else have experience with this?",

                    "comment": "It is such an anxious wait, waiting for an offer. I also moved interstate to study so I know the feeling well. Applications sometimes do take way longer depending on the course - it sucks but if you have an alternative offer from a uni interstate, I would be upfront with them and let them know, and ask them to (politely) prioritise your application.\n\nDoes your course in Canberra start in February? One strategy might be to accept your offer there (so you have it), and if you get an offer from Deakin, then withdraw and make your choice. Obviously this is tricky if you are required to physically start in Feb as I'm sure you won't be wanting to move interstate twice.\n\nI'll see if there are any optometry students in the community to chat to who have received offers and tag them, but otherwise my best advice is to keep communication open and let them know that you're juggling two offers. They likely will not want to lose you as a student if you meet the requirements and are choosing between two unis.\n\nu/iyoteyoung \\- it looks like you may have received an offer for optometry already... Any tips?",

            "comment": "Not willing to comment for years 3 and 4, but for the first 2 years generally only PBLs (3 hours on mondays and fridays), lab workshops (3 hours on tuesdays) and Clinical Practice tutorials (3 hours on wednesdays) have mandatory in-person attendance. Generally it's roughly 20 - 25 hours per week of classes, however it is a 30-45 hours per week (depending on your background, how efficient you are and your study goals) in terms of time commitments in order to keep up with content, completely all of the weekly tute prep, workshop prep, PBL learning issues and any assessments due.\nThe timetable can seem deceptively mild as kerping up with the actual volume of content covered every day/week, coupled with staying on top of the array of regular prep tasks is the main time sink.\n\n**The first block - HB is much less full on compared to the rest, and isn't indicative of the workload for rest of the year.\nHope this helps.",

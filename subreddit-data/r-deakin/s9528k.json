    "postText": "Hey guys, \n\nI am a second-year at Waterfront, who lives in the suburbs of Geelong. \n\nA little while ago Deakin chose to sell the property directly opposite of it (I.e. the carpark), to make way for Geelong's exhibition building. \n\nI feel this is a horrible decision, granted that geelong has quite poor public transport infrastructure, and thus many students opt for transport by car. \n\nWhile Deakin have said they plan to contstruct a new carpark, I am yet to hear anything from the University (despite my attempts to contact the correct department). When i contacted DUSA to contact the University on my behalf they said it was out of their scope (which I find questionable granted they do advocacy work on behalf of students).... \n\nAnd even if the Uni was to have plans of another car park, i doubt that it will be ready by March, or be of the size that the previous one was...\n\nAm i overreacting by being angered by this, should i just trust the Uni or is this annoying other students too?",

Maybe construction isn't starting for a while if that's the case.\n\nRegardless, thanks for sharing this, as I hadn't heard anything about it so would have been in for a bad time if I drove to my first Waterfront day this year given the provisional timetable has me coming for a 9am class.",

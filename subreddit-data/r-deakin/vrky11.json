Is anyone here interested in chatting? Is there a discord (discords?) to join?\n\nIdeally I'd have began in semester 1 like the majority of new students but alas...",

I can't speak for either of the irl campuses, but the online delivery/cloud campus is really good imo. One class I did was a bit of a fuck around, but I honestly don't think it's Deakin specific and there's a couple discords that I found helped significantly for assessment clarification.\n\nIf you have any specific Qs feel free to chuck them my way I'll be happy to help if I can.\n\nOh also I'll quickly add, there's not many trimester 3 CS/IT classes to pick from which is a shame. There's a few options for electives and stuff, but none of the core units are offered in Tri 3.",

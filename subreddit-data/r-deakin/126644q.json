    "postText": "For context, I am redoing my first year because I deferred a couple months into last year. I completed the academic integrity unit for last year does that carry over into 2023 or do i need to redo it? I don't appear to be re-enrolled in the unit this year so I am not sure if i don't need to do it or if I'm going to run into trouble a couple weeks down the line.",

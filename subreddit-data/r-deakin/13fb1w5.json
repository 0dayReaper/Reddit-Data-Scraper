    "postText": "Hi all, \nDoes anyone have any personal experiences they could share with me about how competitive the Masters of Applied Learning and Teaching at Deakin is? \n\nI have a Bachelors of Arts from Deakin but my WAM is 63, and I also have zero teaching experience (not even volunteering). I just wanna know if I would be considered competitive enough for the program\n\nAlso does anyone have experiences getting a conditional offer before completing the CASPer test? As I\u2019ve submitted my application to Deakin for July 23 entry, but my CASPer is scheduled for June\u2026. Not sure if I have to wait until after my CASPer to hear back from Deakin \n\nThanks in advance for all your help!",

            "comment": "It's not competitive to get in. Like most masters degrees, the unis only really care if you have a pulse and pay the fees. The MALT is filled with people who have non-traditional pathways into teaching as well. Very few of them have come straight out of Bachelor degrees.\n\nThe CASPER test I can't answer. I doubt it will be a big impediment. It's really just a box-ticking exercise for someone to gouge money out of you on the way through and the uni covering themselves that if you turn out to be a psychopath they did all they legally could to detect that.",

After only one term of teaching you will already have more experience than the whole degree worth of placements.\n\nThe extra 15 days in the MALT are a special placement where you have to go and specifically dedicate it to an applied learning/vocational experience. Again, if you want to be a 'normal' school teacher, it's not strictly going to be of extra benefit.",

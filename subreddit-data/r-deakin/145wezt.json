Sadly the answer is a bit of grey area and is largely dependent on a mix of how hard you work and how well suited you are for the roles you're applying for on a personal level. \n\nThat being said, Deakin is great at careers - use all of the resources and you will get the internships and the jobs. But it takes work. If you just do the degree and the internships they force you into because you haven't put any effort into finding your own, you might not have the same experience as someone who has designed their career throughout their studies, if you know what I mean. \n\nI can't talk to the salary expectations but I am sure that it would be company-dependent? Maybe someone else can give a ballpark.",

If you already have a lot of skills and talents then you will succeed even without the MBA. If you don't, then the MBA won't help you much and so you are in the same position as before.\n\nCan you enrol in a more prestigious business school ? What kind of career are you wanting ?",

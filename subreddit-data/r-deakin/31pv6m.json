Is this a place for students to hang out casually, or to get information about Deakin or to discuss stuff from classes, or to do all of the above?\n\nWhat sort of stuff would help this place out?",

Sure people should be able to ask questions or get news about uni stuff, but that community feel is important for me in a subreddit. I think it should be doubly important for a sub about as social a place as uni is. ",

They could be any number of things - the afl sub had \"Tops as Tuesday\" and \"The Wednesday Whinge\" which allowed to people to talk about just anything, really contributed to the community feel. We could come up with some more Deakin-specific ones as well. These threads would be slow at first but it would mean people who find this sub would see some activity and have a way to get involved and therefore stick around. It would gradually grow. ",

I mean, off the top of my head, I guess there are a few categories:\n\n* things that uni students might generally find fun\n\n* things that specifically cater to the average uni student price range\n\n* unknown things about Deakin, its campus, or other uni opportunities\n\n* things that might be helpful but that aren't mainstream advice or don't come from an official source (or rather, a chance to share what as most personally helpful, etc.)\n\n* a bitch about Deakin/uni day\n\nIs that the sort of thing that you mean?",

So for example you could have a weekly thread where people can post about their overwhelming assignment load and discuss those sorts of things. Friday could simply be a \"tell us what's on for the weekend\" thread. Maybe a weekly thread for people to ask newbie questions about the uni/campus/cloud etc, so they are centralised and accessible. \n\nI like idea of a post each week to say \"what's on at your campus this week\" with a rundown of events and such too.\n\nI'm about to start work and currently very brain dead (coffee get in me) so I will think a bit more about this tonight.

As for the subreddit itself I'd love to know if there are any events or people hanging out type posts and also official mod type posts when important class related things are happening like enrollment. I don't know, just a few suggestions I guess.",

I don't think that Deakin has anyone whose job it is to work with reddit, so I doubt that it will get more promotion unless it already some compelling content.  Enrolment and stuff could be worked out, but I guess the main Deakin page is just as useful for that?  Social events and whatnot I think would work well here, as well as a way to form groups that want to discuss certain topics.",

    "postText": "In early 2022 I chose to intermit my course for a year. At the time I was still completing work from T3. When submitting this, I advised my lecturer that I was on intermission until 2023. I have reached out several times since but not heard back from them, which is unusual so I'm wondering if staff have rules about student contact while an intermission is active? Re: the outcome of the T3 unit, I can't access the results page on studentconnect (due to my non-enrolment I'm guessing) but I currently have 0 credit points for it, suggesting the work hasn't been graded yet. I have called studentconnect also and all they can really help me with is re-enrolling. If anyone here has any advice or experience with intermitting it would be much appreciated!",

Work doesn't get left unmarked for anywhere near that long for any reason other than the student is no longer in the unit. My guess would be it was included in your intermission period.",

If you are correct then that is really bad, as I wasn't advised that I would be forfeiting my unfinished unit (which was also an internship) by planning an intermission for the following trimester/s. To my knowledge I was never withdrawn from the unit and was in regular comms with the lecturer up until the intermission when it went silent.",

                            "comment": "&gt;I advised my lecturer that I was on intermission until 2023. \n\nRe-reading your post, this part is concerning. If you told them you were \"on intermission until 2023\", in those words, they could easily have interpreted that to mean you did not intend to complete the T3 unit and thus there was no need to mark your work. Lecturers/unit chairs/etc would not withdraw you from units though - that's not their role, it's Student Central's. (Of course without knowing everything you said to them I can't be 100% sure.)\n\nYou say you can't access the results page in Student Connect, but somehow you know you got 0 credit points for the unit in question. I'm guessing that's what you see in DeakinSync where each unit has a card you click on to get to the unit site, and when you finish it says \"Completed\" in the top right? Yeah...if that says \"completed\" and then \"0 credit points\" at the bottom, that's a fail, not a withdrawal. I did a Withdrawn Late in T2 last year and the card says \"Discontinued\" in the top right and the \"credit points achieved\" bit isn't there.",

            "comment": "Thanks again for your responses to this. You are spot on, I can still navigate Deakinsync and previous unit sites. This is where I can see the 0 credit points under my T3 unit.\n\nTo clarify the internship, it was a T3 specific unit with 4 assessment tasks. The first 2 were submitted via the unit site as per normal. I'd been going through some hardship, which my lectures were all aware of, so the last 2 assessments were given an extension and submitted via email. In this same email (and in response to a question about my course plans for 2022) I advised that I would be intermitting T1 and T2 and recommencing in 2023 so that I could recharge.\n\nI can see how this might be misinterpreted but after working so closely with the lecturer on the internship for months I can't see it being the case here. But at the same time, the fact that I never got a reply to this or any emails since are what led me to wonder if my status as an intermitting student has 'frozen' everything, including them being allowed to reply to me.\n\nAnother user suggested I go speak to someone higher up at Deakin, but this lecturer is amazing and supportive and the last thing I'd want to do is get them in trouble after all the support they've given me. I'm happy at this point to accept my failure and move on, but this intermission has just made my uni journey so complicated. I appreciate you Deakin redditors.",

Is it possible that they've left Deakin? \n\nGiven how much time has passed I doubt it'd be possible to salvage the unit but it's worth following up to find out what happened and if there's any grounds to appeal for the fail grade if you did submit the remaining assignments (maybe getting it changed to a withdrawal given the circumstances), or to not have to redo all 4 assignments if you redo the unit, that kind of thing. I can't think of any way the situation could get any *worse* by following it up. \n\nIf you do let us know how you go, I'd be interested to know what went wrong and whether anything comes of it!",

    "postText": "Just wondering about the Quiet building/area accomodation (specifically on the Waurn Ponds Campus). How much noise **IS** accceptable? Are you still able to have conversations in the room? etc\n\nThe residents handbook and the tenancy agreement, as well as the website doesn't have much quantifiable examples of what kind of noise is permissive within the space and was just wanting to hear from someone who is within it.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I had one neighbour who didn\u2019t care about noise whatsoever (and tbh idc either) and one that truly doesn\u2019t like it and will eat people out so it depends on neighbours. But when I moved on we were told; no playing music out of speakers. Nothing louder than normal talking level. So it honestly depends. Last year we had over 80 noise breaches. This year. Max 10 (purely cause people were screaming) \n\nRooms ARE NOT sound proof. I can hear my neighbour talking and their music perfectly at times and they\u2019re not extremely loud. \n\nSo it can be very very strict. Or they don\u2019t care. It honestly depends on the year, the RLs and your neighbours :))))",

You had your own space but had a social side if you wanted and you didn\u2019t have to stress as much. But I mean I played music through a speaker all the time this year and no complaints (but again good neighbours) \n\nIf you are wanting to have your own space but make friends I\u2019d recommend other buildings, people in the quiet building (when I have lived here) love to complain and don\u2019t really come to social events in the building. So it\u2019s honestly more about what type of experience YOU want :))",

It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessarily hard though. There is 4 parkes buildings. All house at least 60 (up to 80)people. So there is heaps of spots. Just put in ur application and see what happens. But there is normally spots for sure (don\u2019t take my word though incase this isn\u2019t the case)",

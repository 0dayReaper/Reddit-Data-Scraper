    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm currently attending a Postgraduate course and just finished creating a Portfolio for an Unit.\n\nMy target grade is only \"Pass\" and the requirements are to complete all Pass tasks. However, there was this One task that I can not finish wihtin the due date so i submitted the portfolio anyway. (I also have 3 Credit tasks submitted.)\n\nIs there anyone here used to be in my situation? Will I still be able to get a Pass grade even if I did not submit all tasks?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I'd strongly recommend submitting \"something\" to the pass task if possible and recompiling the portfolio if you can, because then it is not a case that you didn't submit it, but rather that you didn't /pass/ it. In which case, it might be able to be factored into the grade as a small component contributing 0 marks but does not fall under \"not submitted\". \n\nIt is a little pedantic, but I've seen the wording of some aspects of portfolio contributions taken unfortunately far during my postgrad course, better safe than sorry?",

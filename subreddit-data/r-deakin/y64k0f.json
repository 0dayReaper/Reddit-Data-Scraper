You could try to say you didn\u2019t use another persons work but I\u2019d say considering they\u2019ve already flagged an integrity issue being honest would be the best approach.

You will most likely be asked to attend a disciplinary hearing (please make sure you attend this) and will most likely receive a 0 for the assignment. I\u2019d assume it\u2019s an exam or highly weighted assessment task since it\u2019s October so you will likely fail the unit.\n\nYou will be advised on how to proceed via email, and connect with DUSA to help you through this process. You can even contest the plagiarism ruling if you do not believe you did anything wrong but I would advise against this unless you are absolutely certain there is no plagiarism in your work.\n\nFinally, during your meeting just be honest explain how you were rushing and failed to cite and source correctly. Reiterate that this is your first breach of academic integrity and you are taking the necessary steps to ensure this never happens again. Thank the members present and then they will take time to deliberate before deciding on a course of action. Most likely it will be something along the lines of;\n\nYou will receive 0 for the assignment/exam or unit and will be required to re-enrol in unitXYZ during your next study period and pass unitXYZ. They also may restrict you to 1, 2 or 3 units for your next study period.\n\nIt\u2019s not the end of the world, you\u2019ll be okay. There\u2019s nothing you can do at the moment until you are contacted. Hope this helps and sorry for the long-winded message. Good luck!",

Hope that makes sense. For now however, you should be concerned with your own situation and make sure you\u2019re okay.",

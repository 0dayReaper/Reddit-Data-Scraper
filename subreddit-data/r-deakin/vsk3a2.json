    "postText": "  \n\nHi everyone, sorry for the long post but I have a lot of questions. I\u2019m trying to make an appointment at student central but have no slots till next week. I\u2019d really appreciate it if you can help me with these. \\[Question 7 is the most important one!\\]\n\nI have made the fee payment on 29th June but apparently it hasn't been received by Deakin so I haven't received my COE (even though my classes start on Monday). I haven't got a chance to enroll my subjects in the timetable as I don't have my login details.\n\nI'll be doing Bachelor of Commerce majoring in HR Management, with People Management and International Business as my minors. Here is a list of my questions:\n\n**1.** I have been offered to study at the Burwood Campus. Since I\u2019m not in Melbourne yet, can I take all my classes online? How should that be done?\n\n**2.** Where can I find the fees for each subject? I checked the handbook but I\u2019m required to enter Bachelor of Commerce to view the subjects. Once I did that, there were no matches found for the course. \\[Maybe it\u2019s an error or I\u2019ve made a mistake in the process?\\]\n\n**3.** How can I know the %weightage of each assessment (assignments, final exam etc) in a subject?\n\n**4.** In the course it has been mentioned that I must take a particular number of business and law units. I don\u2019t know the subject codes for the same in order to choose subjects from those units.\n\n**5.** Can I do 1 minor and 4 electives instead of 2 minors?\n\n**6.** Some minors require electives to be completed. The electives are based on application. What if my application is denied? What must I do to complete the minor?\n\n**7.** These are the subjects I have chosen for year 1. Are these combinations of subjects manageable? (I have never taken any commerce subjects before)\n\n(1) Trimester 2- \n\n(i) MMM132: Management\n\n(ii) MAE101: Economic Principles\n\n(iii) MWL101: Professional Insight\n\n(2) Trimester 3-\n\n(i) MAA103: Accounting for Decision Making\n\n(ii) MLC101: Law for Commerce\n\n(iii) MMK101: Marketing Fundamentals\n\n(3) Trimester 1-\n\n(i) MIS171: Business Analytics\n\n(ii) MAF101: Fundamentals of Finance\n\n(iii) AIS101: Intercultural Communication\n\n**8.** The timetable preference portal has been closed. How will I be able to enter subjects into my timetable?\n\n**9.** Typically, how long is a trimester?\n\nThank you so much for going through my questions.",

Keep in mind, international students must ensure they don't complete 1/3 rule or equivalent of their course online. \n\nYou can also use the estimated fee calculator on the Deakin website  if you want to see the price of units.",

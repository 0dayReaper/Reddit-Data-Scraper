    "postText": "Has anyone faced this before?\n\nI am studying a post grad unit at Deakin and the unit chair is simply not releasing tasks in time leaving students with nothing to do for long periods of time.\n\nI have lodged complaints which are underway but now faced with 2x pass task, a D task, and a HD task to all complete by the end of T2, with none of them released so far.\n\nI'm concerned we're just being completely screwed by Deakin being useless.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nUpdate: Some tasks finally released. It does my head in that it seems I have to complain every time to keep this unit on track. Could be just a lack of communication, but either way extremely frustrating!",

Also OnTrack tends to be for the computer-related courses and units, as a lot of them are disorganised and downright not managed right by staff",

I think they mucked up what are pass and HD tasks so following some labs were considered HD whereas a 20,000 word solution design was considered \"Pass\".\n\nI gotta say my experience with Deakin has been that they are absolutely atrocious.",

Hence my complaints are not about them personally and I don't care about any specific apology. I just want Deakin to appropriately resource the units, release the content on time, and give me some confidence that they've got it in hand in future.\n\nUnfortunately, given a chance to disappoint they do, and they've fallen behind (yet again). This time, I've not even wasted a day before going to complaints because it seems to be the only way I can reliably get any traction. I feel terrible about complaining so much, but I'm not sure what else I can do.\n\n1/2 of the NEW overdue &amp; remaining tasks for the unit are now released. I'll be glad when I can finally submit that last assignment! Next trimester is the last one for my course so that's exciting but also, I'm scared!",

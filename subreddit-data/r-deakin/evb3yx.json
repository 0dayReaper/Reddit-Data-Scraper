Also this helps me as a good heads up on what to pack and not plan on buying there. Let me know if anyone is interested in anything.",

I think if it is stuff like clothing and makeup (which I\u2019ve heard is really expensive) I shouldn\u2019t get harassed but I\u2019m going keep researching so I don\u2019t get in any trouble at customs. It\u2019s hard because a carton of ciggies is like $80 and I\u2019m sure people would enjoy some cheap smokes but it seems they have a pretty tight control on imported tobacco",

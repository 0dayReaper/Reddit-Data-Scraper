    "postText": "Hi guys! \n\n\nI'm keen on the idea of studying nutrition and from a brief bit of preliminary research it seems like a grad cert would be the best way into it. As far as I can see it would give me essentially an introduction where I could see if I wanted to continue to pursue it, while also becoming qualified to potentially undertake further study such as a Masters down the track. \n\n\nHowever, it seems weird to me that I would able to study this if my undergraduate degree (from Unimelb) is in a totally unrelated field. Yet the entry criteria seem to just say any undergraduate degree + a 30 in VCE English. Can I really do this course with no formal scientific background, or am I misunderstanding and I'd actually have to start with a bachelors if I wanted to pursue this? \n\n\n\nTo be clear this is the grad cert I'm talking about: https://www.deakin.edu.au/course/graduate-certificate-human-nutrition#tab__1--2\n\n\n\nThanks all!",

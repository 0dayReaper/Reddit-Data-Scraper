    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nI'm going to be studying for a bachelor of health sciences at Deakin Waurn Ponds in 2023 and have noticed some issues I thought people living in the area may be able to shed some light on from a student perspective.  \n\n\n1. Extremely limited job opportunities? I'm aware it's off peak but after checking seek there were only 50 casual jobs which is a tiny amount, is this normally the case from experience? Or is it more a run around with your resume type town?\n2. Quite nervous about housing options which also seem very limited and oddly expensive.\n3. While I gather it is a very peaceful campus, are the classes and everything still decent at Waurn Ponds? I'm doing my second undergrad (First, was a bachelor of criminal justice and criminology from Swinny) and I'm quite nervous transitioning to Geelong from Melbourne, even though I'm originally from the regional Bendigo area.\n4. Finally, I am hopeful that the more tranquil environment will help me focus and aid in my personal development and mental wellbeing recovery compared to Melbourne, has anyone had the area have a similar positive effect on them?\n\nI appreciate everyone's time and did do a search but found limited results. Thanks.",

            "comment": "So sorry OP for such a long response :)\n\n1 With jobs there is heaps it\u2019s just a lot of places don\u2019t always put it on seek, plus atm it is peak season because of Christmas, new year and schoolies that come to Torquay (15 mins away) if you\u2019re willing to drive there is heaps of opportunities in corio, Newcomb and areas like that around. But like the other comment says major chains hire all the time like supermarkets, Kmart, target, any restaurant is begging for staff! Most places in Geelong and surrounds know that uni students move to the area around February so they will normally do a massive hire for the year then so I\u2019d check closer to then - you may just have to change your search on seek as heaps usually come up. \n\n2 Renting in Geelong as a student is hard, it\u2019s always easier to move in with a few friends and rent is approx $150 in most cases for a $600p/w house with  4 of you, however it\u2019s an extremely competitive market. Normally 90% of resis staying on res do their first year at deakin on res to then find a house, most of them moving off res early Feb would have already being applying for rentals with their housemates for a month or two now, it\u2019s notorious for having to put in 60+ rental applications before getting anything, but the other comment is right. Res is always an option and your guaranteed a room basically at the same time on realestate.com (.au? Idk) there is a few houses that landlords rent specific to uni students but they are random people and they\u2019ll come up as like 1 bedroom rentals - it\u2019ll say if it\u2019s for a student usually. There is also deakin house me which is basically the rental market for deakin students which is overseen by a part of deakin (idk what this is like or how it\u2019s ran) \n\n\n3 I BExSS think the classes are okay, not great but okay and my course is like #1 in the world or something\u2026 but I have had friends study criminology and have said that it\u2019s awesome, deakin do have tours etc so you\u2019d be able to see the space before starting and committing but the classes in any course are adequate and give you the info you need at least :)",

I think with the classes I'm just nervous since the campus gave me isolated highschool vibes \ud83d\ude05 and that was a very troubling time for me. So strange since im originally from far more isolated areas, yet living in Melbourne for 4 years has made me hesitant of regional.",

            "comment": "Waurn Ponds nowhere as quiet as Bendigo especially post Covid. Its only like around 6.30pm and after its chill but also 70% of the venues are usually closed. I cannot speak for Crim but i did have a banging time for the one crim elective I chose. \n\nand sageysage is right about the job market. also a few at armstrong, lorne too. a lot of the cas jobs tend to stick fliers rather than use seek \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f also geelong west maccas has been looking for ppl to hire for like forever now \n\nAnd I suppose it depends which part of Melbourne you lived! There is a lot of nice hiking areas nearby campus. But the public transport is really limited. High St is awful imo! If you really miss the chillness of Bendigo though, Torquay is only a 15 min drive away and very chill on weekdays :) my personal fav spot to chill in GOR is probably Pt Lonsdale",

            "comment": "I had good and bad experiences with cloud based group assignments. It mostly came down to the effort the individuals are prepared to put in. Most people are familiar with teams or zoom now, so use them, take minutes, assign responsibility for segments of work and follow up on it during regular \\[at least weekly\\] meetings.\n\nI did find that mature age students were easier to work with, mostly because they're used to collaborative work within a workplace, the downside is that they generally have more going on outside of uni, so it can be harder to find a good time for meetings.",

We met up via Zoom and then wrote and recorded our sections individually, and one of us volunteered to stitch it all together. As long as everybody is organised and does the work, it\u2019s fine.",

It can get difficult trying to coordinate and make sure things get done. I definitely recommend trying to meet through Zoom or Teams once a week and regular communication and check-ins.",

            "comment": "Very rare it\u2019s allowed as one person group, pretty much never. I\u2019m just about to finish my degree and have done around 20 group assignments online \u2014 it\u2019s fine and works well if you use the tools available. Microsoft teams is great for meeting and also working live on documents. It also sets you up for the real world as if you work in a big corporate you will likely be working with people both in person and on Zoom/Teams. I prefer cloud collaboration than in person.\n\nMake sure you get people in your group with the same ambitions. If you want HD, make sure you say that in your post or look for others who want the same - also use your gut instinct when it comes to selecting. Saves a lot of hassle.",

    "postText": "A new transfer student here. I'm taking Theory of Structures for T1 and for Sem 01 only one class is available and its full. Will they give another class for the remaining students?\n\nFor Hydrology and Hydraulics Sem 01 also there's only one class and they automatically enrolled me in it but didn't do the same for Theory of Structures. I already booked an appointment with the Student central, did anyone else face the same issue if so what was the solution given by the uni?",

It's likely that they will be recorded and made available online.\n\nIf there is only one timetabled seminar for the subject, that generates the auto enrollment. Had you submitted a preference for the class in Star last week? If you didn't, or if you have a clash, you need to select from the available options on the star timetable system.",

There's only one class for that  so I'm assuming they didn't auto allocate me to it. I'm having a meeting with  the student central today so I'll ask them about it.",

If they still do, it suggests that you contact relevant lecturers.\n\nYou could do two things\n&gt; Contact student central and they could possibly allow you to choose your timetable, given that it wasn't your fault that you couldn't submit preference.\n&gt; Once you start classes, in a week or two, you could directly ask the lecturers that you want to attend class on other day and they could allow you to do so.\n\nHope that helps.",

Do any current or former students have feedback on the required VCPEP program? I\u2019d also love to know how big the cohorts are; if memory serves me right, I saw that 26 Australians are offered the scholarship and was wondering if there were more or less internationals who are granted it.\n\nThanks in advance!",

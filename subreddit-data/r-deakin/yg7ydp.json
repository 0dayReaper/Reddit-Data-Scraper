    "postText": "Hi everyone\n\nI live in Geelong and I\u2019m enrolled in a Bachelor of Arts (starting in 2023) and interested in majoring in two courses, one of which is criminology. The second major I was interested in doing was Japanese, which isn\u2019t offered by Deakin, meaning I would have to do a cross-institutional study at probably the University of Melbourne. Obviously being in Geelong, it\u2019s an inconvenience because I\u2019d have to get up super early to get on the train to Melbourne just for Japanese classes (which people have told me is useless to study and I'll never get a career out of it, but that's an entire other issue). \n\nSo do you guys think that the hassle to learn Japanese is just not worth it? And if I do decide to do Japanese, would it be more convenient to just do my entire Bachelor of Arts at Melbourne university instead of the cross-institutional study? \n\nI\u2019m not too sure what to do, so any advice is appreciated!",

Some courses require electives to be year 2&amp;3 only, or all years. Once you complete the units you can apply for prior learning at Deakin.",

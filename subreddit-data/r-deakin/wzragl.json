You can click through to DeakinTALENT from the sidebar to learn more about Deakin\u2019s employment services. \n\nYou\u2019ll have to be more specific about what kind of tips you are looking for? Deakin is a big uni with multiple campuses and over 3000 staff and 65,000 students, so it\u2019s hard to know what info to give you",

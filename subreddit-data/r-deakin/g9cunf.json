    "postText": "I have a lot of complaints about the new grading schema and the way they\u2019ve gone about it. Just wondering if you guys have any idea who the best person to contact would be? Student central, DUSA, the fukn vice chancellor? \n\nThis shit isn\u2019t okay and they\u2019ve totally fucked so many students.\n\nEDIT: I ended up sending an email a few days ago to the VC, Student Central and DUSA. This was the reply I got from Student Central:\n\n*\u201dThank you for sending through your feedback on grades and marks.*\n\n*We acknowledge that this is a really stressful time for many of our students, their families and communities.*\n\n*The grading schema was devised to avoid disadvantaging students who have experienced disruption this trimester due to the move to online study and change in final assessment format. It also aims to ensure fair processes are in place for students wishing to course transfer or apply for postgraduate study. The Grading Schema is a system rule that will be applied to all student records and unfortunately cannot be altered for an individual.*\n\n*The Dean of Students has been reviewing student feedback from a range of sources to hear as many student voices as possible and DUSA has been in active consultation with the Deputy Vice Chancellor Education (DVCE).  The Deputy Vice Chancellor Education will be communicating with all students via video within the next day or two addressing student queries and concerns that have arisen since the announcement last week.*\n\n*We have published FAQs on the grading schema and will update these as more information becomes available.*\n\n*If you have further concerns after the DVCE\u2019s next communication, please contact us at Student Central. If you have further concerns which can\u2019t be resolved by Student Central, you can then contact Student Complaints who will do their best to assist with a resolution.\u201d*\n\nBiggest lol of my life. Hopefully DUSA is able to negotiate something better for us. I\u2019ve put my heart and soul into this Trimester, and I\u2019ll be damned if it doesn\u2019t count towards my WAM.",

I *need* to improve my wam to be considered for further study, so from the outset (before a lockdown was ever even considered) my determination to do well has been extremely high. This was the first trimester in a very long time where I was able to override my anxiety of attending campus in order to do better academically. Then all this covid shit happened, but that hasn\u2019t affected my determination to do well. Yeah, I\u2019m still getting better marks than I ever have, but imagine the marks I could have gotten if 1) I was able to attend on-campus classes; 2) the stress of covid wasn\u2019t impacting my everything in my life. \n\nWhat it also fails to consider, is the different levels of disadvantage that people face due to covid. For example, single parents who are having to homeschool, WFH *and* somehow study, vs. students who don\u2019t have to balance all those things. Regardless, we\u2019re all disadvantaged, but the fact of the matter is, it\u2019s at different levels for different people. \n\nIt\u2019s all just bullshit and I\u2019m angry at the world.",

For those of us who need our wam for further study, it means that the units from this trimester are not counted towards it. This puts us at a disadvantage, because we have less opportunity to have as high a wam as possible",

I\u2019m inclined to say that it\u2019s not, however I could be wrong. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m still trying my hardest this trimester to get amazing grades so that if an opt-out option does become available, or they change the system entirely, I\u2019m not totally fucked bc I decided to chill out for the tri. I\u2019d recommend the same for anyone who needs their WAM until more information becomes available and we can make better informed decisions.\n\nAlso, even if the system stays the same, we\u2019re all still going to have a graded band on our transcript. Other unis will look at this and (I assume) take it into consideration. They\u2019re more likely to take someone with a higher grade band than a lower. So I\u2019d still be trying to do my best in regards to uni work. It\u2019s worth noting though, that basically every uni has a different system (something that is an issue in and of itself), so some may take this banded grade into consideration, while others may not. It\u2019s all up to that particular unis discretion.",

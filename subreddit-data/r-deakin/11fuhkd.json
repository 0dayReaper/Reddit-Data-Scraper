    "postText": "Hello Everyone..! \n\nI am planning to apply for a master's in AI or Data Science at Deakin for July 2023 intake. And I want to know if this course at Deakin is really worth it. What is the teaching style for this course (i.e. it is more practical or theoretical )? what kind of programming language is taught? How many days per week do we have to go to uni for classes?  \n\nAnd is anyone from this community currently studying the above-mentioned course? Then please share your overall experience about the course, teaching style, programming language, maths, and all. \n\nThank you.",

            "comment": "Hi,\n\nSorry in advance for the short novel, but hopefully this will answer some of your questions. \n\nI'm currently finishing off a master of data science. I came into it with pretty limited stats knowledge and zero coding knowledge, but am currently sitting on a HD overall. I do find though that I have to put in a lot more work compared to students with a proper IT or pure math background.\n\nThe units will have you using either R or python (with the languages used in the capstone and thesis units depending on your topic). The quality of the course depends on the lecturer. It has ranged  from one lecturer refusing to assist students and even having a go at one in the discussion forum (I've never seen anything like this before - how they're employed is beyond me) to a lecturer that would send me pages of handwritten formula when I was struggling with some of the math and take the time to explain it and respond almost instantly to my emails. Just noting that the first example has been only one unit, the majority of lecturers are great. \n\nIn terms of practicality, it again, depends on the unit. I've found some with really broad assignments that you can approach a number of ways and it's largely marked on how you justify your approach, and others that are much more strict in what they want. I've quite enjoyed the capstone and thesis units in particular since these are less rigid and more explore ways to tackle a problem and do it, however they are quite time intensive. \n\nI am entirely online and everything is recorded, so I just attend classes in my own time. Just noting though that the thesis and capstone projects require regular meetings (all done via teams) but there is flexibility there. \n\nOverall I think it's a good course, but haven't studied in the IT area at any other universities so can't comment on how it compares.",

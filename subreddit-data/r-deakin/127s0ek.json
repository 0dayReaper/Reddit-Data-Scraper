    "postText": "Hello if anyone here can be of assistance it would be much appreciated. I am doing a bachelor of OT at Deakin (Geelong) and the forms for practise education are due on Monday. However, I cannot access the portal to upload my documents (it keeps saying there is no account registered with my name) and the fit2work police check link that has been sent to me from the unit is apparently expired. I tried to reset my password and also get the police check link resent to me, but neither of these emails have entered myself student inbox or any other folder. I have emailed the unit chair, emailed the head of practise education and also posted on the discussion board. But with it being the weekend there is no one available to respond to me until Monday which is the day it is all due. Will the unit chair help guide me in time to have everything sorted? Or am I fucked?",

    "postText": "Hi peeps,   \n\n\nI have one last trimester left and I mess up on one unit. I basically have to submit a Deakin Air video and a word document with a powerpoint presentation. I successfully upload all 3 but because the video was a big file, it took a while. Due to having multiple tabs open during exam week, I think the submission didn't click and was not successful but I thought it was, just as the submission video was successful and thought they were all uploaded altogether. This is on the last penalized day of the assessment, or rather the 5th day as I thought this assessment was not mandatory and already have a passing internal marks from the other assessments. Do you think the unit chair will allow me to resubmit as the submission box has close? I have email him but can't find a peace of mind as it is my last trimester and I think I mess up pretty hard. The video was however, uploaded on the 5th day and I shown him the evidence that it was uploaded within the 5 day time frame for sure. Any info or feedback would be appreciated so much. Thank you",

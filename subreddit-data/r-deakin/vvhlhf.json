    "postText": "Hi guys, I\u2019m doing bachelor of commerce (major econ) and bachelor of art. I\u2019ve completed 16 units of commerce and now need to finish remainder of my arts degree. Im majoring in politics and policy studies but need to pick 6 more units to finish my degree by end of next year. Can anyone who has done or still doing arts recommend easy arts units to complete minor? Thanks in advance",

Since English is my second language, I feel hesitant to study literature units because I\u2019m not familiar with the language devices in English compared to my native language. If it wasn\u2019t for this obstacle I would have gladly studied similar units",

There\u2019s even a part you do on picture books so the wording isn\u2019t very complicated. If I\u2019m remembering right though there wasn\u2019t much focus on wording and grammar etc",

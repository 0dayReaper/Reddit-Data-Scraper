    "postText": "Im an international student and planning to take bachelors of nursing at this university, i needed 7 each bands on ielts, however i got 6.5 on speaking and writing. I talked about it with my agency and they told me i can still finish my degree in nursing but through a different pathway. First year I\u2019ll be completing my diploma of health instead of diploma of nurse. Then i will shift to 2nd year nursing degree and continue until 3rd year. Is this pathway okay for me? Will it make a huge difference in the future or not?",

When applying for nursing my student advisor told me that there are several different pathways if I didn\u2019t get the scores needed to get into nursing. I don\u2019t think it would make that much of a difference as long as you\u2019ve got the degree in the end but you should call the uni to make sure:))",

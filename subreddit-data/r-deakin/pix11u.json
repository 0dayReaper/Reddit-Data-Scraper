With that said, knowing Deakin they'll probably keep people like Dr Nick Patterson, PhD who add no value due to lack of any real world experience or professionalism, and get rid of people who actually contribute value to programs.\n\nReal talk too - why is there a Bachelor of IT? It makes infinitely more sense to take hands on courses at TAFE or vendor certifications than to undertake a stale, already-outdated course taught by lifelong professional academics who can't keep up with industry.",

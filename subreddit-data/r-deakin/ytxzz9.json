            "comment": "I found HBS300 Ethics Decisions and Frameworks pretty straight forward - first unit where I got 100% on an essay, but I also worked in clinical ethics for several years before returning to uni so YMMV. I'd advise against HMM105 Applied Ethics. The unit staff are from the medical school, so despite being a first year undergraduate unit, the marking seemed much harsher. Got marked down on my first essay for being too detailed and not focusing on the 'broader question', but then marked down on my second essay for not going into enough detail. Only managed a distinction.\n\nMy tip to getting an HD would be to pick units where there's greater objectivity in marking - i.e. units which rely more on quizzes and multiple-choice exams than essays or literature reviews. I once got 84% for an essay in an Arts unit, and this was literally the only feedback: \"Great work [my name]! Very hard to fault!\".\n\nHBS310 Brain, Biology and Behaviour is actually one of the most 'objective' units in psychology I'd say. Not everyone finds the subject matter easy, but the assessment was quizzes, multiple-choice exam and 'seminar manuals', which are basically longer quizzes with diagrams. I also vaguely recall that they allowed you to resubmit those seminar manuals for lesser marks if you didn't pass.\n\nIf it doesn't have to be Health, I'd highly recommend doing a unit like SIT190 Introductory Mathematical Methods or SIT191 Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis (very important for psychology). I was able to get 100% in both units because you can literally calculate whether or not your answers are correct before you submit.",

Tonnes and tonnes of reading. \n\nYou should pick a subject you find interesting, if you naturally enjoy it the good grades would come easy.",

I remember taking few communication subjects back in days and even though I had an amazing result I don\u2019t remember what I studied because I didn\u2019t apply it in real world. Wish someone gave me this piece of advise then, good luck :)",

                    "comment": "I think you're right for most domains, but marks are still important for postgraduate study. If OP is looking at psychology units, they might be wanting to practise as a psychologist, which means either honours (80+ WAM) or a grad dip (minimum 65+ WAM but entry is still competitive, and tuition is three times more expensive than honours).\n\nIf OP is looking at something uber competitive like Medicine, they'd definitely be wanting straight HDs in their third year at least.",

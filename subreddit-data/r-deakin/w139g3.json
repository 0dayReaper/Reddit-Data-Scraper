    "postText": "Hey guys, \n\nI'm from Deakin Uni and wanted to let everyone an event I thought would be great for health students.\n\nMy club is hosting a health case competition which is running on Tuesday, 25th July, 6 - 8 pm. **Regos close this Wednesday.** \n\nHere's a link for more details: [https://2022deakinhealthcase-event.getqpay.com/](https://2022deakinhealthcase-event.getqpay.com/) \n\nNo prior casing experience needed. You don't have to have a team sorted just select a number group (but of course participating as a team is more fun). \n\nThanks for reading this post. I'm part of the committee and planned the event, but we've been struggling to promote it. I initially thought more health students would be interested but this seems to be the type of thing commerce/business students would like more. Let me know if you have any questions. Would be more than happy to answer them:)",

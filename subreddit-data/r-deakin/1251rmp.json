So since knowledge is power, it's less power.\nBut, if people can't attend or make life easier to continue educating yourself without attending classes, then that is the option available in some classes.\nThe current motto I keep hearing is, \"P's get degrees,\" and it's not something I respect or think is a good mentality for higher education students. I would go as far as to say that it's probably a contributing factor to antivax people in science related fields from bachelors all the way to PhD. achievers.\n\nI'm sorry for the tangent, but stopping ' just getting a pass in a subject' as an acceptable goal is important. Kids struggle to be motivated as it is. With having to do so many years of lower education and then pushed into higher education, we don't need that kind of mentality.",

I find I learn things way better if I'm just given the materials to go through on my own. My grades have gotten way better ever since online learning has been better implemented since Covid.  \nThat's just lectures, tho.

I hope my comment above represented that I understand everyone learns differently, and if it didn't, I'll confirm that I agree now.\nWith ADHD being more like a spectrum or maybe more like a 3d model spectrum with branches shooting off, I can't exactly say I understand. I also have ADHD but found being at home with all the distractions far worse. The bonus of online for me is the availability of recorded lectures so I can rewatch and take notes. But as I said, at a general university student level, students who attend all classes, including lectures, fair better in the long run. It's advisable to attend everything and not just pick the assessed classes such as labs, seminars, and tutorials. Divergent individuals such as us can obviously be an exception to this but aren't always, with myself being a key example. I attend every class I can and usually achieve 80s in all of my units. I wouldn't have been able to, without having attended.",

Ones that cover a lot of formulae or technical stuff like maths and physics are hard for me as I only need to zone out for like, 10 seconds and I am completely lost lmao, and that's on my good days! Those subjects I definitely fare better on my own.\n\nLectures that involve a lot of discussion back and forth between the lecturer and the class are great tho. I will pick up on bits and pieces that I may not from at-home study and I can ask the wacky questions that would often distract me at home xD\n\nAnd yeah, no two people with ADHD are the same. Apparently a lot of people with it struggle with reading books because of distraction issues, but give me a good fantasy or sci-fi and I'll read it cover-to-cover inside a day or two. I also never really had issues with leaving my chair as a kid, but you better believe I was the one being told of for tapping my pencil or fidgeting with something or other lmao.",

We can all have our own opinions on it, we're all entitled to it, I just don't see reason as to why people can't have the mindset. If it's an elective that you just need to do, why not just aim for a pass? If the subject isn't going to matter later on I'd rather put more effort into subjects that matter more. For me it depends on the subject, but I don't measure my knowledge from the content based on my scores. If I feel I understand the content and I just struggled with the assignment then I am okay. Also whose to say people who don't attend classes still aren't achieving knowledge? Not everyone who doesn't attend classes doesn't catch up online, I do. Some people like myself have extreme social anxiety and the online learning really helps with that. For me I do not strive to get 80s and 90s just for the sake of doing well, I strive to finish the degree and learn skills. My marks don't matter to me as long as I am satisfied what the knowledge I have.",

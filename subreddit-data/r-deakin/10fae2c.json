            "comment": "If not February, then your options are July, or maybe November, or next February. \n\nPros of earlier: \n- you can take a lighter course load for first semester to adjust, or you can hold onto being a bit ahead to take a lighter course load at a later time\n- it's quiet for newbies, so you'll have priority support\n- if you don't start in July, you'll lose a 1-2 trimester head start over if you started even later. \n- you'll avoid falling behind financially. Every trimester you delay enrolling could be a trimester you delay graduating, and once you graduate you can earn like 70k+ off the bat, breach 100k+ in a couple years. Roughly speaking, you're then losing out on that money long-term. If you have a 40 year career, delaying might make it a 39 year career. In 5 years, you could have 1 degree and 1 years worth of pre-degree pay, or 1 degree and 1 year of post-degree pay. What's your goal? \n\n\nCons of earlier: \n- you won't start when everyone else starts, so you might find many people have already make \"cliques\". This is a minor issue, the people you want to be friends with will be friendly regardless, you will have varied classes and group projects to mix up your social exposure, you will meet people and make friends if you are motivated to do so. \n- you probably won't get all of your classes every semester, since courses are usually set up T2 prerequisites are in T1 etc. Courses change very regularly in modern times (may several times over the time you're enrolled) so an odd start time may make scheduling a bit messier, you might not be able to finish in precisely the minimum number of trimesters. BUT you would likely always be ahead or in line with if you had started LATER, unless you fail something or do not take a class when you needed to. A regularly updated course map would mitigate any risk here. \n- if you're working, you could grow a better nest egg before starting, because university is an expensive time of life. If you're not working, you could invest more in relaxing, developing hobbies, having fun (especially if you're young, and just graduated highschool!). I'm old now, and I wish I had spent a bit of time doing literally anything other than working or studying. Being \"a year behind\" is pretty meaningless. \n\n\nYou'd be best positioned if you talk to a student officer and develop a course plan for your options, which will clarify what your course would really look like at those different entry points, and how your prerequisites line up. That, and then figure out what you care about the most, and how it's impacted by the different options. \n\nBest of luck!",

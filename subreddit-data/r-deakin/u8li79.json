    "postText": "I just had a tour of the Deakin Burwood campus today, and wanted to ask a few questions here before it slipped my mind. For context, I am looking to study a bachelor of psychology, and so far Deakin seems to be my top pick. Normally I believe this degree would take around 3 years to complete full time, however on my tour today the guide mentioned that Deakin operates with the trimesters in the year, not two semesters like many other uni\u2019s in Australia. Apparently most people take trimester 3 off for work or travel, but there is the option to take classes as usual over this trimester. This means that the three year bachelor degree can be completed in only two years, which would be great for me. So my question is, is studying for 3 trimesters a year advised, specifically for psychology? And if you do the third trimester, how does the distribution of units work? For example would you ende up \u2018out of sync\u2019 with your peers, being essentially a trimester ahead of everyone else? And approximately how many people choose to study for this trimester?\n\nThanks in advance",

If you have extra units available to take in T3 you could theoretically speed up your degree, but not all subjects are on for all Trimesters, so you would have to plan it well.",

            "comment": "When I started I also thought of this too. Currently I'm doing a double degree in criminology and psychology. I do 4 units in trimester 1 and 2. Taking trimester 3 off. From my experience with workload you could hypothetically also do 1 or 2 units in trimester 3 but it will be pretty full on since u will only have a few weeks of holidays between each trimester. Try plan your trimesters so you don't burn out. I would not recommend doing 4 units for each of the 3 trimesters only 2 trimesters at most. Hope that helps.",

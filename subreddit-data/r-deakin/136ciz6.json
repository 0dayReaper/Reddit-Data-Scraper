I would highly recommend that in case you don\u2019t get the campus accomodation, you look into other student accommodations options (if you are able to afford it) in the city or around. Those are easier to get into than trying your luck with off-campus / renting on your own right now. \n\nTry to get a short term rental first and then once ur settled, can physically go for inspections and sort your documents out - start applying or getting onto a lease with somebody.",

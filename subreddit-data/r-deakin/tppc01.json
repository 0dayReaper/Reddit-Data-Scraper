            "comment": "\\*\\*Are you looking for a chance to learn/practise new skills with like-minded people?\\*\\*If you are, We have the perfect FREE app for you. Some mates and I have worked hard and developed an app that helps Deakin students like you find a place to learn/practise a new skill with mates and help you stay accountable.**Our main features include:**\n\n1. Creating or join an event based on what skill you are trying to learn,\n2. Group chat function to keep everyone in the group motivated\n3. A challenge list each group can create to stay accountable on the learning journey.\n\n**Why you should download the app**\n\nWe understand that due to Covid, we missed out on many opportunities to develop and get ready for our future success, so this is an app that is a fantastic chance to learn new skills and make friends that will push you forward in life.\n\n**If you are interested, you can download the app here**\n\nIOS: [https://apps.apple.com/au/app/str1ve-learn-new-skills/id1610536200](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/str1ve-learn-new-skills/id1610536200)\n\nAndroid: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AGM.strive](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AGM.strive)\n\n**Final Note**\n\nAnd sorry if the app has some bugs because it is still in the early stages. Please provide feedback so we can improve. We would really appreciate it if you could create events and gather like-minded people to practise/learn a new skill together so we can grow and create a more pleasant app experience for you!",

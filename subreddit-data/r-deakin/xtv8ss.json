    "postText": "Hello, \n\nOut of the two above mentioned courses which would help me to get a PR and job. I would major in microbiology or biochemistry. I will be immediately starting a job after completing my course. I\u2019m not planning to go into research field. Which was the above course has maximum job opportunities with a good pay scale. Does one get jobs as food technologist, biotechnologist, microbiologist, scientist, quality assurance officer just after completing graduation. Food and pharmaceutical sectors generates maximum jobs for the above course. Do companies offer jobs to fresh uni grad and what\u2019s the pay scale? What are the qualifications that companies look for while hiring for above job roles?\n\nAny other job profile that I should look into which is beneficial for PR or could get me handsome money to help me survive in Australia till the time I get my PR?\n\nYour suggestions would be of great help.",

            "comment": "Hi, nowadays, an undergraduate is not worth much. So if you want alot of money, this isn't the pathway. It's simply a career path to get you a job in a field you like. That's my opinion any way.\nThat being said, a bachelor of biomedical really focuses your skills towards the medical fields often lab related. A bachelor of science is simply just that. It's an all rounder with a major that could focus you towards something specific. However, im pretty sure you could apply for any job after completing either undergrad degrees. Essentially both could get you the same job.\nIf you do not wish to continue further, just pick one that has units that interest you so you can at least enjoy it. I know someone who applied for a neuroscientist roll with a bachelor of biomedical and it has no real knowledge for that field. Undergrads really are the basics of science and have great potential skills that are highly transferable.\n\nTldr: biomedical and science undergrad degrees could net you the same job. You will earn a living and that's it. They don't pay incredible incomes. Just make some good connections during your workplacement unit.\n\nHope this helps. \ud83d\ude00",

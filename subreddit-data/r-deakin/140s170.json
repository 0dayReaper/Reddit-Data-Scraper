Complete contrast to the written assignments during the Trimester which were a breeze despite no time limit.\n\nMost likely miss a HD on that one now.",

I actually think I should be doing more. Can't figure out which to prioritise, and after several years, still fail at time management, haha.\n\nI quite liked epidemiology and biostatistics as well as Advanced Topics in Biomedical Science.\n\nI'm sitting at HD for all 3, but exams can throw you a curvball, and I may find I drop to low to mid 70s.\n\n3rd year units have tough exams, and with ChatGPT being a concern, it seems they're really focusing on student comprehension of all the concepts rather than minimal comprehension and memory recall. Which I like. But if the unit hasn't prepared you for that and only supplied you the memory recall information, I'd say it's a failure for that unit.\nSensory neurobiology and behaviour seems to fall into that category. There is plenty of information and resources to look at. However, it lacked a way to conceptualise the content for the week and then cross conceptualise it through the weeks. A way to do this would be similar to the unit Advanced Topics in Biomedical Science. It provided weekly learning objectives to write summaries on. Which was on top of the weekly unit learning outcomes (which are often so broad you can't figure out how to structure your self-learning around them).",

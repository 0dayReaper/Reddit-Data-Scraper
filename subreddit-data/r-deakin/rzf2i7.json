    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI need to complete a pathway degree in order to be eligible to study a Bachelor's at Deakin. I am well aware that they provide their own pathway courses through both the University and the College, but I am mature aged, live in Regional Victoria, have a job and family commitments, so I am unable to commute or move to the Melbourne area for studies. Which complicates things a little.\n\nI just wanted to know if anyone had any experience completing a Diploma or Asscociates Degree elsewhere and then their experience getting into Deakin. \n\nIf it helps, I'm wanting to do a Bachelor of Arts and am looking at doing an Associates in Arts or a Diploma of Arts ( or something similar )\n\nThank you!",

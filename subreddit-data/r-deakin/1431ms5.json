    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm planning to apply for a course that starts in T3. I'm an international student and therefore would have to comply with the study  obligations for the student visa. I saw that T1 and T2 are generally compulsory study periods, but if you start in T3, then it becomes a compulsory study period as well (linked below). \n\nCould anyone who's started in T3 let me know if all trimesters during your course end up being compulsory study periods or is there a diff way it works?\n\nThank you\n\n(https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/student-life-and-services/international/compliance-visas/visas/enrolment-conditions-for-your-student-visa)",

Only thing is that if ur course doesn't have core units gg on during T3 you can only do electives. You can go thru all the units and which semesters they happen on + prerequisites and past yr course frameworks on the sch website and send in inquiries as well, they can help u confirm how ur course will go. Feel free to pm me if u have any qns :)",

From 2024 T3 is an optional trimester unless T3 is a compulsory according to your course structure. \n\nif you do not enrol into T1 or T2 (compulsory study periods), you will get warning emails to enrol or your CoE will get cancelled",

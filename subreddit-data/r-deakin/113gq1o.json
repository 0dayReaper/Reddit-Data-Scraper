When the units open, it is best to check this. \n\nAs for recordings, not all lecturers/unit chairs record and upload them. All of my arts and law units have in the past but it will depend on your faculty and unit chair.\n\nYou can reach out to the unit chair if your questions aren't answered in the Unit Guide.",

I like the fact that I can attend classes at any time I want and I can re-watch or slow down and rewind the content as needed when learning a new concept. I have impeccable notes as a result and have done very well in my psych degree because of this. Honestly, the amount of content I must have missed when I went to uni in the traditional on campus setting many years ago is staggering to me. It\u2019s just not possible to keep up with note-taking to the standard that\u2019s required for some subjects (eg statistics \ud83e\udd2f) in order to grasp the concepts. Recorded lectures are the bomb.",

If you have specific reasons to not go like a access issues or mental health then that\u2019s different but if your able to, can afford to and are just trying to make a choice then my honest advice is go to every single class. You can pass most uni by just going to lectures/workshops and doing the assignments if you don\u2019t you will need to study more.",

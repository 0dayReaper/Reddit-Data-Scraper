They don\u2019t usually for lectures but sometimes do for seminars/tutorials/labs even if attendance is not mandatory just for their own records or to keep track of students who may need intervention for poor engagement. I study at Deakin but work at a different uni and we take attendance for these reasons as well. The department of home affairs periodically requests attendance info throughout the year so they can monitor international students\u2019 compliance with their visa conditions.",

I recommend skipping if it's an imposition to your ability to keep up to date, because it's a waste of time better spent studying in a way that works for you. The only thing that matters is that you have the resources you need to submit your tasks on time and in good quality.",

            "comment": "Teachers upload videos of their lectures and slides. Sometimes many in advance. When I was there workshops/seminars were recommended but we\u2019re not always feasible to get too. Make great friends where you can all collaborate with your notes should one or more of you not be able to make one or more sessions. \nA lot of teachers will also allow you to attend another teachers workshop should you not be able to attend the one you signed up for. Obviously openly communicate this with both to make sure everyone is okay with it. \nTry to schedule it all to the best of your abilities to your home life and social responsibilities but also be aware that if they don\u2019t have a lot of sign up you may just get put into a seminar that blows everything out of proportion. Double booking is very common. STAR tries to prevent that but it can still happen. \nBe prepared for one class on one side of the campus and have little to no time to race to the other side of campus for your next one.",

    "postText": "Hi all\n\nJust a vent here about some consistent bad experiences with Deakin trying to get information as a prospective student. \n\nIn 2018 I wanted to do an MBA. My first pick was Deakin, but I started making enquiries at multiple universities\u2026 I just could not get an answer from Deakin to my questions for WEEKS. Calling, emailing, nothing worked. I ended up enrolling at another Uni and completing the MBA. \n\nI\u2019m now starting a Juris Doctor, and again wanted to see about Deakin. I put out some enquiries to multiple Unis again, and again Deakin experience the worst. The student adviser generally unhelpful, said he\u2019d call me back with info, never did and was then rude when I reached back out for the answers..  \n\n\nAnyway, what\u2019s the deal? Do they not realise they\u2019re losing students because of this?",

            "comment": "Even before COVID hit, the management geniuses at Deakin decided to pull the student support staff away from the faculties and centralise them in a hub (of course, also slashing costs by getting rid of some of them in total). This meant that instead of having a Faculty expert who knew exactly all about your course enquiry, you could now be speaking to someone about a Business degree who had spent their whole time previously advising on Health courses. And they would just be reading stuff out of the same handbook as you.\n\nIt got worse with the COVID restructuring, when people on cost-cutting KPIs decided to slash staff even further. Now people are definitely turning away from Deakin because the whole experience from initial enquiry onwards is so sub-standard.\n\nThe result will be that in a year's time, management will have a meeting panicking about lack of enrollment and retention. Their response will be.....must cut costs.\n\nUniversities seem to lag about 20 years behind corporate life as the management consultants recycle and re-package their old failed ideas to new clients. The uni sector is currently in about 1995 \"slash overheads and out-source it all to contractors\" phase.",

It\u2019s soooo annoying but i am hoping once I get to campus it gets better since I can physically go there and ask them things. \n\nHope you find some luck. I do just call usually during business hours and when they are available, they have helped me. But overall - really bad communication and follow up from their end. Ughhhh!",

It sucked before during and after when I studied there a few years ago, and I used to laugh at the semi regular emails reminding me of the alumni discount. I swore I'd never go back.\n\nWell joke's on me because I'm applying again and yes, nothing has improved. I spent weeks running around submitting and resubmitting documents based on unclear instructions from a no-reply email address, and when I tried to call to get clarification they were rude and unhelpful. They seemed completely baffled by my request to contact the person who was actually dealing with my application.\n\nAll that said, my experience with Deakin has still been way better than with Swinburne which is my other option, so I guess I can look forward to a few more years of this shit if I'm lucky.\n\nGood luck with it all!",

I was put in touch with one person who was completely inept and couldn't answer the most basic questions (or gave answers that were blatant lies, which I found out later). But I was stuck with her, and any time I called I would be put through to her despite begging to speak to anyone else. Every time she would tell me that the email she had meant to send me was \"stuck in her outbox\" and she would send it immediately. Then she would send it and it would be one or two lines just confirming we had spoken and wouldn't answer any of my questions.\n\nI told her I wanted to know whether I was eligible for a CSP before enrolling, and didn't hear back from her about that for two months over the Christmas holiday period, so figured that I wasn't and she couldn't be bothered dealing with me anymore. Then in February I find an email from Swinburne saying hey it's day two of classes and you haven't logged in yet. And I'm like, what? Look into it and turns out she had enrolled me without my knowledge in a full fee paying place.\n\nI emailed them and told them to withdraw me immediately and that put me in touch with actual Swinburne staff who were fine, and very apologetic. But before they withdrew me I did get a glance at the course content and oof, it was very lowest common denominator stuff. It would be an easy way to get a degree if that's what you're interested in, they clearly hold your hand a lot through it, but I don't know if it would be a fulfilling experience.\n\nOf course, YMMV depending on the course you're doing.\n\nFWIW I'm enrolled at Deakin now and they've been great, heaps better than last time I was there. I was studying through Curtin in Perth prior to this and they were also good.\n\nGood luck making your decision and with your future studies!",

This is my last trimester for my course and the results for one of my units have not been released yet (they made an announcement claiming it\u2019s due to several extensions by other students). I have been submitting all my assignments on time, and this has affected everyone in the unit and not just me. I figured I didn\u2019t want to chase up the lecturers and let them do their thing. However today I received an email stating I am now ineligible to graduate due to \noutstanding results (it\u2019s still not out yet). This is very frustrating given I\u2019ve done everything by the deadline and yet I\u2019m having to delay my graduation as a result. I have emailed the unit chair and other lecturer but the unit chair is currently on compassionate leave. Does Deakin give leeway in such cases? Do I still miss graduation as a result? I\u2019m not sure what to do.",

Here\u2019s a recent post asking a similar thing that you might find helpful. \n[Exercise Sport Science](https://www.reddit.com/r/deakin/comments/fqbs4a/help_year_12_looking_to_do_sport_science_at/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nI\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll get a lot of responses purely because we\u2019re a small sub and this is a very specific question, so my best advice is to ask lots of questions to the student advisers and watch their videos, and go to o week.",

Honestly the info sessions online will be just as good, you\u2019ll learn all the same stuff and you can probably still visit campus to do a tour if you want",

But lectures are there to help you so if you ask if you can come to a seminar they may say yes as people stop turning up after the first few.\n\nIt's not uncommon to join a different seminar if you missed another one because you're sick etc. So you won't be the first person to ask.\n\nAlso, if there's a particular unit you wish you'd rather have chosen in person you have up until the census date to change.",

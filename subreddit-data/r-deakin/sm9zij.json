    "postText": "I just waited over a week to speak to an adviser about my course units. I had a used the course plan to plot out what I thought my plan should/would be. They didn\u2019t want a bar of it and I was told \u201cemail it through and we will get back to you in 3-5 business days\u201d I let the lady know our appointment was for 30 minutes and that I could email it right now to be told \u201cno sorry I have other appointments\u201d. \n\nAm I in the wrong thinking I should have gotten more from this appointment? I am genuinely considering withdrawing, Deakin was my first choice, and I have offers from 3 other universities.\n\nEdit: I called back, and spoke with another SA and she was amazing! Answered all my questions, took her time, most importantly restored my faith in Deakin.",

I've spoken with Deakin's advisors before and they were great for me.\n\nI would love to give the benefit of the doubt here; with T1 being the busiest enrolment period, I'm sure the advisory team is under a lot of pressure right now. It's absolutely no excuse; just some possible perspective.\n\nI'd recommend calling the new student line and tell them that you are considering leaving over this, and to include the name of the advisor. It would likely get their butts into gear about getting you a new, expedited appointment with a different advisor.\n\nI hope things work out for you!",

However, I do highly recommend *calling* 13 DEAKIN, rather than making an appointment. You will get faster response time imo. Yes, you may have to wait before someone picks up the phone, but once they do, they're not going to fob you off straight away. \n\nThis is pretty poor of the in-person advisors, though. When you get the email asking about their service, respond with a critical essay.",

I ended up getting a phone call back from a student administrator within Eng who was amazing. She spent ages on the phone with me, answered every question and gave me good advise. \nIt seems the process is initial SA requests go to a generic team for basic questions / answers then sent out to specific departments admins for stuff outside their scope. \nI\u2019ve also found some of the SA\u2019s to be absolutely rude and disrespectful, but the faculty to be really helpful, inviting and easy to deal with.",

Especially if you're younger and have gone from high school to uni. However, I would highly recommend picking up a unit that you will like but will also supplement your knowledge for the future. P's get degrees is a poor attitude but sometimes necessary if only to take the burden off a potentially poor mark.\n\nThat being said, I don't remember any easy units per se. I mean, compared to biochemistry and systems physiology, there are easy ones. But tbh those 2 are extremes, and most units fall into a general difficulty category in year 2.\n\nThere are animal biology related units that are a nice change to what I would call the regular unit flow.\nAnimal behaviour is one. Animal diversity is another.\nBoth are quite different and interesting.\n\nAll the best and obviously, you do you. I've only made suggestions due to experience. \ud83d\ude00",

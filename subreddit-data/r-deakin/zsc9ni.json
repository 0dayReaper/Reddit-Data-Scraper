    "postText": "Hi, I just finished year 12 this year and I received an offer from Deakin for 2023. Im planning to use a HELP loan to pay off my uni debt and the offer email says that my enrolment isn\u2019t confirmed until I\u2019ve filled out the eCAF form, I accepted my offer yesterday but still haven\u2019t received an eCAF form. Could any students please tell me how long this form usually takes to arrive in your email? Or if i should contact Deakin if it was meant to come immediately or something. Thank you",

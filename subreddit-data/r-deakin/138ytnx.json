    "postText": "So hello y'all,\nYesterday was a sweet ending to the Intensive week. It all ended well, very well. And the interactions during prac day were sweeter; not to say the industry day wasn't so, but the prac day stays lovely due to the collab.\nCall this an AMA session maybe?!?! Feel free to ask anything about this week and any units you usually begin with, in T1.",

                    "comment": "Ah yes, that's the first question I had about the certain units at the most! It's a significant chunk of your units requiring physical engagement with the equipment and public there in general. It's labs for SEB101 &amp; some events for SEJ104. It's more like a project for electrical systems engineering unit. It's a lot of work and a lot less than that, which one doesn't necessarily know and having some adequate info about for T1 would be helpful! About units in general too, there could be some inputs from all the corners! Its just a week that can last forever and no too. So after the relief and ease I felt, here's an initiative in calling all the fellas to interact about it!",

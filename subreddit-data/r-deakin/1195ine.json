    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nSo hello all!\nAny tips, resources and opinions about T1,T2 in particular are much appreciated, thru the perspective of Mechatronics Engineering.  Opinions about Mechatronics Engineering, it's trimesters, resources, faculty and for now at least, the T1 fun scenario I can expect ? \nRecently began delving into various spaces in Deakin and its gr8, clear so far. I'll be resuming things there, tho ugh reddit here or any other space elsewhere would be no less I believe !  It's insane self learning anyway, but reference frames are gr8, so pls shower them through your inputs :)\n\nFor SIT199, https://yoshiwarabooks.org/trig/trig.html , https://yoshiwarabooks.org/mfg/MFG.html, https://lyryx.com/linear-algebra-applications/ along with HELM workbooks that covered complex numbers, stats and prob too well. \n\nFor SEB101, Halliday 's Fundamentals of Physics by tallying it with https://www.deakin.edu.au/courses/unit?unit=SET111 , except that I'm not sure of what extent would the electrical concepts be introduced !\n\nAbout SEJ104, tell me more about the \"CAD Skills test\" too.\n\nAny grads, currently studying or prospective students here?? \n\nAlso, that 1 intensive week per each trimester is def majorrr, especially being an international cloud student, so starting from accommodation, duration of stay to possible activities and works to be done, at least in T1 , a good idea to prep well is what I hope to have here... it's the first time coming abroad !!\n\nAny grads or currently studying ones here ?? Tell me more about it !! Also, what all should be known about the 1 intensive week for each trimester ? As an international cloud student, gearing up has never been this majorrr....\n\nP.S.\nSomehow now only yesterday's post is being shown....Umm, so ya, considered the post today.",

It's an important unit for mechatronics, and helps set you up for a lot of other units. Once you figure out how to do a basic lab report, there's a few units where the assignments follow a similar format. The practice questions in the book form the basis for the exam and quizzes, so doing a lot of them is helpful.\n\nThe cad skills test wasnt difficult if you've put a bit of time into learning more than just the basics. Mine was to draw a water tank of set dimensions.\n\nI'll try add some more info tonight.",

I'm not sure how they handle the intensive weeks for international cloud students, but the general format for the ones that I attended was any practical activities would be done in one or two days, then the lab reports would be written over a longer period. Sometimes the intensive weeks would also be timed with oral presentations.\n\nThey also wouldn't normally last a week, but I think the very first one did last most of the week.\n\nOther things... \n-Khan academy is helpful for brushing up on different topics.\n-First year, especially first semester, seemed harder than others, but that might have been just trying to find the general pace. I definitely wasted time putting way more effort into some early assignments than was necessary. I'd rather do that than not put enough effort in though.\n\nFor mechatronics, having access to basic electrical test equipment is incredibly helpful for different assignments. You're going to be making different projects, and the inevitable fault finding will be a lot easier with the right equipment. Try find a makerspace near where you live.",

                                    "comment": "Sure. Covid definitely curbed a good amount of alternate scenarios so present intensive weeks can be majorly different. About the intensive week part, I'd be coming on a visitor visa so the duration of stay and accommodation won't be a big problem I hope. And about \"making different projects\", it could be out of the intensive week, right ? Then, I'd need to find equipment here itself. As you are domestic, physically visiting and utilizing equipment would be possible. To what extent do you think the circumstances made you utilize them apart from intensive week? I'm almost done with all the math resources aforementioned and Khan Academy was already no problem, hope I'm good about SIT199 at least. For SEB101, I'm pretty good with Fundamentals of physics book. Overall, do you believe the prescribed texts good enough indicators of how would the tests, assessments and quizzes be? If you can recall, anything about \"Engineering in society\" that has an intensive week btw ? Alas, from your personal experience, how was your T3?",

But the intensive week covered topics that would probably be covered by it.\n\nI did a few units in T3. I found it useful to do one or two units then, and do less units during T1 and T2.\n\nThere's a good mechatronics lab and workshop at Deakin, so you won't need to find access to these things locally, it's more for when you do major projects - typically in units that are worth two credit points. Some projects that I did were Automatic teller machines, parcel sorters, payload delivery vehicles, and a garden water controller. Generally, you'll be given the design brief in week 1, then have to present your solution in week 11. Building it in a week isn't feasible, so you'll need.to do a bit of work at home. As a domestic student, I was able to access them quite frequently (before covid) to help my project. \n\nThe problems from the Halliday book for seb101 were fairly indicative of the exam, but the difficulty of the questions varied.\n\nFor Sit199 (and sit194), I can't remember much of the exam, but I think it was loosely based on questions from the suggested textbook. I can recall that they really wanted to test your understanding, rather than just following a series of steps to solve a problem.",

Considering a fairly good mix of factors that imply Cloud ain't no less, I'm where I'm. At times, there aren't any gazillion factors, but ease and a way out. I'm consolidated with that. Perhaps the health constraints and so much organic and exhausting experiences for many months, 1-2years, inlcuding the love for Mechatronics followed by  this Deakin choice was a good map. I just went onto it when I got in, right on. It was great, it still is and I wish it'd be. Amazing clarity overall. Btw, peers aging 18 or so won't be the possible case in cloud ; fairly obvious. Nothing harmful and no other specific incentives in choosing alternate scenarios. Overall, this pursuit won't go wrong I believe. Hope you've been doing great after graduating and life's going well. Thank you too much once again :)",

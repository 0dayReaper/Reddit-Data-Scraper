    "postText": "Hey there,\n\nI am an international student from Nepal. I was looking to pursue Master of Information Technology at Deakin University.\n\nI saw that Deakin offers Vice chancellor scholarship for South Asian countries (only 5 countries which includes Nepal). \n\nI am really curious about what level of candidates gets this scholarship. For my experience, I have met all the requirements for scholarship. Apart from that, I have 2.5 years of working experience and I am running my own startup from last 3 month which has around 10,000$ in revenue. Apart from this, I do have experience with events, I am actively participating in conference and have also contributed as a member in a UN event.\n\nDo you think, if there is a possibility for me?",

I'm an incoming T3 student and applied for the Vice Chancellor's scholarship as well.   \n\n\nIt's incredibly competitive and the first thing they really look at are your grades. From my experience, your experiences + personal statement all come second. But as long as you make the minimum requirements, it's definitely worth a shot. Unfortunately, I wasn't granted the VC  scholarship, however, they did grant me an international student scholarship which is valued at 25% off. :)",

A Deakin medical certificate for special consideration form (PDF, 227.2KB) or a medical certificate from the treating medical/health professional needs to clearly state the severity/impact on your ability to attempt or complete the relevant assessment task (completion of the Deakin medical certificate is preferred but not mandatory). Medical certificates must be current and cover the relevant assessment or exam date. Back dated medical certificates will not normally be accepted. Telehealth medical certificates will be accepted.\n\n[https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/studying/assessment-and-results/special-consideration](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/studying/assessment-and-results/special-consideration)",

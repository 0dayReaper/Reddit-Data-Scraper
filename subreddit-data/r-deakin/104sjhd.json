    "postText": "Hi, I am due to join this course for masters soon. I needed some urgent input but I recieved no response to my detailed previous posts. \n\nIf there's anybody out here studying or with awareness of this course I would really appreciate if you could help me out with a few basic questions! (It will not take time)\n\nI am an international student trying to make my research thorough before finalising this huge investment &amp; with no other connections in Australia, I would be really grateful if anyone in this sub would be kind enough to reply.\nThanks.",

            "comment": "I think the reason you aren\u2019t getting a reply is because a Master in Creative Arts is unlikely to have huge enrolment as the job prospects aren\u2019t the same as with other industries and really only established creatives in their field may be looking to level up to Masters (or perhaps teachers in Creative Arts). I did undergrad in theatre arts so can speak from experience that as a staving artist I wouldn\u2019t have been able to justify a Masters in a creative area as it wouldn\u2019t translate to guaranteed job outcomes like most other Masters courses do. That being said a friend of mine recently finished her PhD at Deakin in playwriting as she was already a published and respected playwright and wanted to work at the uni and now can lecture there so that is a reasonable income stream. You really need to ask yourself how this degree will better your prospects. If it will advance your career in some palpable way, great! If it\u2019s just to carry on studying the creative arts, you don\u2019t really need that to be a professional artist. Anyway. I think that\u2019s why you won\u2019t find many people on this form in with the background to answer your post.",

A lot of different sites and people enforced my belief that this masters was infact a good idea ripe with potential. Thanks for this, it was much needed.\n\nI basically want to pursue design (graphics, visual, UI/UX) + writing. From my secondary research there's a good amount of scope for that in the job market (not as good as say, engineering or nursing, but decent enough). \nComing from a creative field, what are your views? Would you agree with this?",

Please don\u2019t base your decision on my impressions alone but I feel that this Masters degree may be better put to use with something more specialised if that\u2019s the direction you wish to go in (ie design). Writing is a separate thing again.",

Deakin offers a specialisation in visual design, that combined with my previous experience and skills should be enough I believe. From what I understand, there are placement fairs and such over there but ultimately everything comes down to your reach and ultimately your portfolio, which surpasses your uni/degree etc., is that right?",

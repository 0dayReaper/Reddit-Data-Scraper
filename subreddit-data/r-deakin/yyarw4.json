Talked about trying a course that didn\u2019t feel right and why I think I\u2019d be better suited for the one I\u2019m now applying for kind of thing. Idk how important they are but I felt like honesty and passion in my personal statement helped me where my grades might of been lacking to get me over the line. Hope that helps \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc",

I encourage you to take time to learn the core values of the school you\u2019re applying to and allow that to be one of the topics included in your personal statement. Also write 2 challenges you\u2019ve encountered in life and how you think conquering those will help you uphold their core values. Also expect to write at least 500 words. Use a source in your statement to support your writing points. Proofread X 5.",

The whole point if those is to give the prof a feeling for the students and who they want in there program.  \n\nMine was only a few lines, I stated how this was a horrible compromise as the data they really want would only come over time from interactions with each other, but I understood they didn't have time for that with all the applicants.  So I told them I'm not wasting your time on a large essay.  If they felt I didn't waste enough of their time put me in the program, waitlist another student, and get to know me.  If they didn't want me after a week let me know.  I would bow out, swap programs so they could let the other kid in.\n\nI got in.\n\nI don't recommend that.  Profs today outside stem are all HR wanabe losers with no class or reasoning ability.",

Avoid the temptation to make them feel sorry for you, however slight - it won\u2019t go well. \n\nDon\u2019t stress about it too much, either",

Are you applying for the undergrad degree or the honours year only? I don't think there's a right or wrong way to go about a personal statement since it's all about you, but I would recommend the following points:\n- Why you are interested in this course \n- How may skills and previous experiences (work, education, volunteer, etc) help you to successfully complete this course\n- What do you hope to achieve from this course and how it will help you achieve your career/personal goal.\nHope this was helpful - good luck!",

I'm wanting to do an honours year in psychological science (for entry into masters in clinical psych). I've included what you've mentioned so I'm hoping it gives me a leg up. Thanks heaps again!",

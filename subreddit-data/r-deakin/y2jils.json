    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m currently studying a bachelors of communication (advertising) and I\u2019m now at the stage where I need to be planning for an internship unit as I am approaching the final ~6 months of my course. The issue is that I am currently in a situation where I need to move out of home by the end of the year, and I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m expected to give up one of my paid jobs to substitute with an unpaid internship, OR if I even need to give up one of my jobs in the first place. \n\nMy internship needs to be a total of 150 hours through the trimester which is about 15 hours a week. So surely this wouldn\u2019t leave me in a situation where I HAVE to leave one of my current jobs, right? Or would this be a situation where the internship would specifically require me to be at a worksite, or working specific hours? Or does this vary from internship to internship? \n\nI have talked to Student central who referred me to the work integrated learning team, but thought I\u2019d ask this sub first to hopefully get some advice from students/past students.",

You don't have to finish the internship over one trimester. It's a super flexible unit, allowing you to start and finish said unit at any time rather than at the beginning and end of the trimester. You can also choose to halve the length of the internship for more assessments with the unit chairs approval.\n\nIt might take you a lot longer to finish your internship, but you can choose to do one or two days on it and work the other days in the week.",

However, I\u2019m not sure about flexibility and having a paid/unpaid internship, was just thinking that it might be good so you can still earn money or earn extra money if possible.",

I think I\u2019ll be okay continuing with my 2 jobs while working an unpaid internship at night or on my day off if I can. I doubt my employer will mind too much about my hours since I will be unpaid after all",

Hours should be flexible, you should be able to do it in one chunk or a few hours a week, and work it out with your internship company. If you need to stretch it out past the trimester dates that should be possible too",

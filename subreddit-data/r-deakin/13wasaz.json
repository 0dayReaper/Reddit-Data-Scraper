I have a small family and work, so I would love to know if it\u2019s something that I would need to be coming to campus 5 days a week or is it more flexible?  \n\nI know it will be a lot of work, juggling family, work and study. I just want to hear from others before making a decision!! \n\nThanks :)",

            "comment": "I think i might be able to help with your question. I might not be exactly what you're looking for since i am not a deakin student but a monash student doing nursing and midwifery (1st year).\n\nthe actual classroom contact hours - not sure how deakin works, but at monash, you normally go to campus 3 days a week. Some days you would have to go on campus for a whole day for a few classes(e.g. tutorial and labs) and other days you might only have to go to campus for 1 to 2 hour classes, not too bad and left plenty of time for me to work. However just because we have a lot of time, these time should be use to self study and the purpose of coming to class is to consolidate what you learned by yourself outside of classroom hours. At monash, we watch our own lecture in our spare time and only go to campus for the tutorial class to discuss them or do the worksheets given. We also have labs class (2 hours) and CLE (1 hours), it's similar to hospital environment since it's a clinical learning environment class. Tutorial classes can range from 1 to 2 hours.\n\nDo you need to be coming to campus 5 days a week or is it more flexible? At monash uni, NO you don't have to, classes can fit into 3 days. Since you says you, \"have a small family and work\" I think sometimes you can just skip the tutorial classes (not recommended) and just email the lecturer what went on in the class and send in the worksheet you missed so you can do it in your own time, I usually do this when I'm late or lazy to go to campus cause it takes me 2 just to go to campus.\n\nIn term of placement, I heard that at deakin, students get earlier to placements (placement in first semester) which is fantastic! At monash, we only go on placement at the end of the year after passing our required unit.\n\nThe contents in nursing (I have not taken any midwives classes yet): \n\n1. bioscience - the heart, the brain, spinal cord, nervous system, respiratory system\n2. nursing: vital signs (learning how to take blood pressure, pulse rate, etc), CPR and etc\n3. communication: how to communicates to different patients e.g. indigenous patients\n\nI feel like the decision is up to you, if you think your life would be much happier and fulfilling after doing this degree go for it! Age should not matter since I also have a cousin who changed entire carrier from completing commerce at deakin, work for a few years at the bank and now doing a diploma instead in what she loves. So you're not alone!  \"It will be a lot of work, juggling family, work and study\" Definitely, it would not be easy, but if it's something you love doing, it will be worth it at the end of the day!",

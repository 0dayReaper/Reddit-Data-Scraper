So I need to get a new laptop for my course commencing this year because mine is almost dead. I\u2019m going to be studying IT and wondering if it matters whether I get a Windows or MacBook?",

Sure, you can run a windows virtual machine on the Mac but then you have to suffer the performance hit of running two OSes at once that are sharing system resources. When you are trying to get work done on this slow, laggy piece of shit you will question your life choices.",

They create and test all tasks - including testing yours for assessment - on a specified  version of Visual Studio for Windows. If you want to use something else you're on your own. I'm a Windows user so I don't know the extent of the headaches it may cause, just remember seeing a fair few posts on the online discussion forums about it in those units.",

Worst case scenario hardware wise, you might need adapters etc if you\u2019re doing anything with an arduino or running up switches in a home lab so you can plug something into the type C port on the newer laptops. Software wise, say you need windows to run up windows exclusive software. Look into Bootcamp which is a standard Mac feature on basically every MacBook in the last 10 years or so roughly (if yours predates Bootcamp, you might have some troubles in general with the old hardware performance), because you can very easily install windows on your Mac so you don\u2019t have to buy a windows PC.",

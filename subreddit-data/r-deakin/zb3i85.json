    "postText": "My final placement in teaching is coming to an end soon, and I do not believe it has gone very well.\n\nI have already received a fail on my placement once, and this could be the second time this could happen. There are slightly extenuating circumstances in both the cases, but I don't believe they are big enough, and I genuinely believe that I have messed up.\n\nIf I fail, I could be excluded from the course. Its my final unit, its a job I am really passionate about, and I have no idea what can happen,\n\nDoes anyone know what is the usual course of action here? From the uni's side, and from my side? Its my final unit. I will still give it all I have, and try to pass, but if that does not happen, what are the usual consequences?\n\nThank you for your time",

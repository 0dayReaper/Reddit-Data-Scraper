            "comment": "CASPER is not too bad, though it can feel intimidating in the time limit you are given. And the sample answers they give you online are just not realistic to be able to crank out on the spot.\n\nRemember that CASPER is just a way of the university covering its arse. Plain and simple. They get you to pay for a 3rd party test so that if you turn out to be a psycho, totally unfit for teaching, Deakin can say \"But it didn't show up on the testing. So we did our due diligence. You can't sue us.\"\n\nI don't think many people fail the CASPER. It was originally started as a way for American colleges to differentiate the millions of people they got applying for medical degrees. It's use in Australia is just the organisation making an up-sell.",

The classes I have done so far have been useful in terms of understanding the reasons behind different teaching strategies and the lecturers have been good. the CASPER test was fine. just a test to make sure you are an empathetic person.",

    "postText": "Hi all! I applied for residence as an international student at the end of December. It's been a long time since then but I only recently got my COE which they said they needed for me to get a housing decision. So I guess my application was *completed* just now? Although I applied prior?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been contacting them back and forth and they've been lovely replying to all my emails quickly. I did tell them in my emails that I didn't have anyone in Melbourne and needed a decision asap. However, they haven't given me a straight NO but still suggest I look outside the campus for safety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really know what to think of this since they haven't rejected me and I really wanna live on campus. My classes start March first week and it's high time for me to look for houses outside if they aren't providing me an on-campus accommodation. But I'm so confused since I don't have a sure yes or no yet.\n\nIs anyone else in similar situation? What do you guys think I should do?",

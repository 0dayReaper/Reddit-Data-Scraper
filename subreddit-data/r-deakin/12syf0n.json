    "postText": "I'm looking for potential undergrad scholarships to apply for, I saw the requirement for Deakin's was a 95 atar which is achievable for me, but obviously only to 26 people, but how competitive is it really? How many people apply? Does it mostly go only to like 99+ atars even though it says 95? I'm trying to look for volunteering opportunities to build up more of a profile but I'm not sure how much time I should put into that rather than funnelling more time into studies. I could use a little humbling where its due, thank you.",

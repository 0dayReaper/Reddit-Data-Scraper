It\u2019s ok to hang back at first, to take the measure of the place.  You\u2019ll find that if you attend in-person lectures, people will usually end up sitting in the same places, and naturally you\u2019ll end up on at least \u201cnodding and small talk \u201c terms with the people sitting near you.  You\u2019ll find your groove eventually.",

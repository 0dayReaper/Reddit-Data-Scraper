    "postText": "So hello all!\nAny tips, resources and opinions about T1,T2 in particular are much appreciated, thru the perspective of Mechatronics Engineering.  Opinions about Mechatronics Engineering, it's trimesters, resources, faculty and for now at least, the T1 fun scenario I can expect ? \nRecently began delving into various spaces in Deakin and its gr8, clear so far. I'll be resuming things there, tho ugh reddit here or any other space elsewhere would be no less I believe !\n\nFor SIT199, https://yoshiwarabooks.org/trig/trig.html , https://yoshiwarabooks.org/mfg/MFG.html, https://lyryx.com/linear-algebra-applications/ along with HELM workbooks that covered complex numbers, stats and prob too well. \n\nFor SEB101, Halliday 's Fundamentals of Physics by tallying it with https://www.deakin.edu.au/courses/unit?unit=SET111 , except that I'm not sure of what extent would the electrical concepts be introduced !\n\nAbout SEJ104, tell me more about the \"CAD Skills test\" too.\n\nAny grads, currently studying or prospective students here?? \n\nAlso, that 1 intensive week per each trimester is def majorrr, especially being an international cloud student, so starting from accommodation, duration of stay to possible activities and works to be done, at least in T1 , a good idea to prep well is what I hope to have here... it's the first time coming abroad !!",

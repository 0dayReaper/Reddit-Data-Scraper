    "postText": "I am a new RMIT student who's studying software engineering 1st semester. I find it really difficult even to pass the subjects because I haven't done computer science or computing before. Right now I am doing discrete Maths subject and programming studio , I am really scared that I might fail them. The thing which I find difficult is that the course work pace is too fast, we learn a lot within a really short time and we get assessments which are really difficult when compared to practice questions, we get less time to finish and those assessments weigh a lot for the final grade. For each subject we get a an assignment per week and also another assignment to complete in 2 weeks with a partner. I am thinking of joining Deakin university from second semester, is it a good idea? Is it less stressful?",

            "comment": "University is notorious for covering a lot of material quickly. Most students won't have done computer science before either though. Normally units won't assume prior knowledge.\n\nNot many people have been to both universities to compare them so it hard to say. Normally though there is a linear relationship between the prestige of the university and the difficulty of the courses. Of course the units cover similar material, but if you go to say Monash it will be more theoretical and difficult than say Deakin. Since RMIT has a higher ranking than Deakin, Deakin units are probably a bit easier on average.\n\nTry hard to pass your subjects though, because Deakin will take them into account if you want to transfer. I'd research the Deakin degree carefully as well as other aspects like the Campus before making a move.",

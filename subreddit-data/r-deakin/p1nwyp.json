            "comment": "As a mature aged HR student and an HR manager of many years, I believe in mandatory vaccination. This belief is further fueled by the fact I work in disability and our clients are crying out for vaxed staff, but because it's not mandatory staff think they can shirk their civic responsibility to protect the vulnerable, leaving us in a bind. It's stressful and infuriating. There's a massive call out for disability support workers to be mandatorily vaxed, just like aged care workers. But it should be mandatory for everyone in a front line position. Supermarket workers, healthcare staff at all levels, staff inside GP/medical clinics, anyone entering a university, high school, primary school, childcare facility,  etc. It should also be mandatory for interstate and international travel. \n\nThis isn't going away, and the only way it becomes easier to deal with is through thorough, mandatory vaccination (save those few who have a legitimate, diagnosed medical reason to not be vaccinated); which then furthers my argument for heard immunity to protect those who can't protect themselves. \n\nThere also needs to be harsher punishments for those who are out in the community knowing they are infected, and potentially/actually killing people (hi, NSW, we see you). \n\nBut what REALLY needs to happen first and foremost is SCOMO and Co need to get their heads out of their arse,  take responsibility, step the eff up, and provide access to MORE doses of ALL vaccines. The priority groups need to be widened to young people (16-25) as they are our frontline workers for the most part, who SCOMO deemed \"essential\" during the first wave, with nothing to protect them.\n\nEdit: spelling",

I agree with a lot that you\u2019ve said, it makes sense, and agree that we need to protect our front line staff and by association protect the public.  You\u2019ve explained your point of view really well. \n\nI 100% agree that the federal government needs to take responsibility first and foremost. This is the thing I\u2019m most annoyed by. A National response is what we need",

I do not go out very often at all, for largely the same reasons. \n\nI do think the federal government needs do two things to make the situation in Australia safer (and before any company imposes mandatory vaccination):\n\n-Properly implement a large scale, properly funded vaccine schedule. Privatising the vaccine roll out has been a disaster. Make the vaccine available, quickly, to as many people as possible. \n\n-Set up a fund for families affected by vaccine injuries. If the government is confident that it\u2019s safe- show people by setting up an indemnity scheme. People will be a lot more likely to accept a mandatory vaccination if it\u2019s treated the same as other mandatory vaccinations. \n\nOnce those two things have occurred, it will be a lot easier for organisations to argue for mandatory vaccinations for staff and is, in my mind, a lot more ethically sound\n\nETA thanks again for the discussion. I have found this to be very cathartic",

There have been reports after reports showing it is more expensive and less useful than just funding public healthcare properly. But *nooooo.* We have to make sure the PM and his cronies (regardless of who is in power) have their pockets lined alongside their $500K salary. The COVID roll out is just the latest bungle with the most immediate evidence available. *PUBLIC* health should not be *PRIVATISED*. What a f\\*\\*\\*\\* oxymoron. Anyone with 3 braincells banging around could have seen this going poorly and TADA! yes, it did, and still is going poorly.\n\nI could not agree with you more in regards to the indemnity. There is already a sold frame work in place for other vaccines. They just need to copy and paste the policy, readjust for %of likelihood, cost, etc and be done with it. It really does not take a lot to get the public to trust in a system.",

Least of all there is not yet an indemnity fund, so forcing people to medicate is highly unethical. \n\nFor the record I\u2019m fully vaccinated, I just have a major problem with the government pushing institutions to make this mandatory, while they shirk their responsibility to roll out a vaccine schedule properly. \n\nit\u2019s really none of the University\u2019s business as to anyone\u2019s health status, or to discriminate on those grounds. \n\nI see this as problematic.

Here is Aus were fortunate; we are a literal island and have the chance to stop this thing killing people, and making it a safe play for refugees and immigrants again. But not if our government keeps ballsing up stock levels and roll outs. The misinformation and the news hyping up excessively minor issues is going to be the death of us. \n\nYour point about mandatory vaccination for primary schools is so spot on. What's one more vaccine to keep everyone safe/safer?",

The reason so many young people aren\u2019t vaccinated is not because of refusal, it\u2019s because there isn\u2019t enough supply and the government botched the roll out. So why jump to mandatory vaccinations before the whole population has had the chance to have a choice, first?\n\nI don\u2019t think it is the University\u2019s business to know health information of every student and staff member. I think it is their business to offer a safe environment, and options for those to participate who can\u2019t get vaccinated (study in the cloud or work from home). People who vaccinate can choose to come to campus. I think this is a much more reasonable response and it doesn\u2019t impede on anyone\u2019s body autonomy or take a choice away from anyone.\n\nETA: mandatory vaccinations in primary schools are subject to indemnity schemes. It means that if your child is injured from the MMR vaccine, you are financially compensated. It\u2019s not the case with this vaccine, and the government refuses to set one up. Instead they are putting pressure on businesses and institutions to make it mandatory on their behalf. It\u2019s cowardly and unethical. If the government wants to make it mandatory, set up an indemnity scheme.",

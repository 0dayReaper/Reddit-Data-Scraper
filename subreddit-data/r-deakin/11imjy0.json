    "postText": "Hey everyone, \n\nI'm just wondering if anyone else is doing SIT223 this trimester? I'm doing it as a cloud student and I'm a bit confused about how the class actually works. I don't know anyone doing the class, so I'm keen to hopefully get in touch with anyone who is. \n\nAs far as I can tell, there doesn't appear to be an actual lecture, and instead just a single online workshop every week?  I'm aware there will be group work, will these groups be allocated for us? \n\nThanks for any information",

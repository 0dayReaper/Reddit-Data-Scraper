    "postText": "Heyo, \n\nnot too sure what everyone's political outlook/leanings are on here but just thought i'd shout out and say that the Deakin Labor club (Geelong), has launched and membership is just 2 bucks... \n\n[https://www.dusa.org.au/clubs/deakin-labor-club-geelong](https://www.dusa.org.au/clubs/deakin-labor-club-geelong)\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/DeakinLaborGeelong](https://www.facebook.com/DeakinLaborGeelong)\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/deakinlaborgeelong/](https://www.instagram.com/deakinlaborgeelong/)\n\n[https://discord.gg/WDHPrquj](https://discord.gg/WDHPrquj)\n\nOur members are pretty much just people interested in politics. You don't have to be strictly labor, we just gather to talk politics, have a drink, and socialize amongst other activities...... Plus Uni is a great place to expand your political knowledge!\n\nOur first event will also have eats provided for all those keen :)\n\n\\- The treasurer",

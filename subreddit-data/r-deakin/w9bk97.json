It is worth 25 percent, so here is my question...\n\nAm I able to still pass the unit even with one failed assignment (there is three I need to submit for the unit, assignment 2 is worth 50 percent and assignment 3 is worth 25 percent) as long as I do somewhat decent on the other two?",

You can find out if its a hurdle in your unit guide. But obviously now you'll have to make sure you do well in your next 2 assigments in order to pass. For future assignments, you can also try to email and contact your unit chair for extensions, given you have a valid reason.",

You can withdraw at any time, but if you withdraw by the census date (I think- check this for yourself) you don't have to pay, and it doesn't count as a failed unit.",

            "comment": "The answer to this depends on the actual score you get for this assignment. \n\nMy understanding (of my units, at least) is that your entire unit score is out of 100, with each unit added together to create the sum out of 100.\n\nIf you manage to score 13/25 on this assessment, you need a combination of 47 marks on your next ones to get a minimum credit. Ideally you'd get a minimum of 30 on Assessment 2 (60%) and a minimum of 17 (68%) on Assessment 3.\n\nIf you get lower than 13 on Assessment 1, you've put yourself into a little bit of strife, and will need to haul ass on your next assessments -- you'll also have to recalculate based on that score.\n\nUse your rubric to help aim for a desired score.",

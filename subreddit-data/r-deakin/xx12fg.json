            "comment": "In tune with the others, I'd say diversifying your skills is valuable depending on where you want to go! I don't have a double degree, but I took a bridging course in a different area to my base degree. I've found it made me a more well-rounded and skilled individual and thus made it easier to be \"impressive\" among peers with the same initial background, but hasn't necessarily opened doors that wouldn't have been open to me. It's like a little bonus on top that gave me perspective and complementary skills.\n\nOn the flip side, it will cost you an extra $10k or so, but will ALSO take one extra year off your total length of qualified employment. Your final retirement package will contain one year's wage fewer contributions. You will be one additional year further away from a level of financial freedom that might allow life-fulfilling things (travel, marriage, childbearing, volunteer work etc).\n\nQuestions that I'd ask you to consider:\n\n\\- What specific career path would you find most fulfilling? Do you want to do something that is cross-cutting across both degrees? And are you very firm in those ideas?\n\n\\- How ready are you to enter industry (if that is your desire)? Will spending an addition year in an \"adolescent\" life phase help you feel more well rounded? Are you waiting to begin key growth phases til after graduation (moving away from parents, moving away from home town, starting basic employment, dating or serious relationships etc), and thus would benefit from getting to that stage sooner, or are you able to do them simultaneously?\n\n\\- Do you enjoy study, or are you pouring from a jug that is slowly emptying? 3 years is a good amount of time to do one single thing. Longer can make it harder to stick to a far away goal. If you crash and burn with two half finished degrees, you'll be in a much harder position to move forward.\n\nPersonally, I am incredibly glad that I \"left\" uni with a single bachelors (not my original intention), worked in industry for a a year to find my feet and my drive, and returned to uni to diversify my skills based on what I realized I needed. Many basic courses offer 1.5 year bridging courses (a graduate diploma that is equivalent to a bachelor's degree) to people with bachelor's degrees and who performed well. Up to half of that can be sometimes be given as CPL if you have 2 years of relevant industry experience.\n\nAdditional notes on post-grad courses is that they are designed to work for people that are working full-time, so you do not need to delay qualified employment if you wish, or can work part-time. And then on the note of working part-time (a math-heavy example): 100% FTE on a gross salary of 70K, you'll take home roughly 55K. At 60% FTE (3 days a week), pro-rata gross is 42K, and you'll take home 37K. So you'll end up working for $31 an hour part-time, or $28 an hour full-time. Your place of employment might also contribute to the cost of your studies through outright payments or paid study-time.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with the way I chose to do it and would recommend it to anyone else to which it might be applicable.",

            "comment": "Double degrees are one of the biggest long cons universities have come up with in the last 20 years. They will keep telling you that it will make you \"more well-rounded\" and \"more employable\" but they are straight just double-dipping you.  It also allows them to satisfy parental ambition in recruiting students by saddling a kid who really wants to do Arts or Science with an extra Law (for mum) or Business (for Dad) degree that they aren't that interested in.\n\nThe starting salary of someone with a double degree is going to be no more than one with a single degree because they will still be *entry level jobs*. But your HECS payment and time till first pay cheque will be years different.\n\nAs others have said, if you find in your career that doing accountancy or whatever will be useful, there are PG options for that which will be more focussed than just slapping a straight Business degree on top of your primary UG qualification.",

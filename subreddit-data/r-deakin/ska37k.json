It brings them problems and can be really difficult if more students start to voice about it. So they will stay quiet. I was a lecturer in a different institution and I have seen the worst of it. My first advice would be to speak straight with the teacher/professor that is causing you problems and then see if there is any change. That is possibly more effective than the university channels",

            "comment": "In response to those who asked, obviously without being too specific, it's an issue with a lecturer who is intentionally intimidating and threatening me. Its crippled me emotionally and I am not functioning, my mental health is declining rapidly and I cannot complete my work in other subjects... and I have exams starting this week. I dropped out of her class last year to avoid having to deal with her nastiness (although now I am stuck with the hecs fees) and have tried to retake the class this year, only this time she's made clear that she plans on destroying me (threat put in writing). DUSA cannot do anything about this, they dont have that kind of power.  \nThe rest of my workload, not to mention my young family, is suffering terribly, as I am trying to prioritise this subject in the hope that if I at least do well in the subject she wont fail me. But she's made clear to me that it is what she intends to do. She's a brilliant academic so she knows she can destroy my career before its begun.",

DUSA absolutely is your next port of call, assuming that you have tried to approach this with the lecturer / unit chair already.\n\n**You need to gather all your tangible evidence of this person bullying you** (emails, screenshots of chats, messages, etc), as well as any diary entries you have kept or notes of your interactions (and dates), and take this to DUSA. You can ask for an advocate who can help you navigate the complaints process or other avenues of support. If you haven't been keeping notes of your interactions, you absolutely need to start doing this now. \n\nAn advocate can help you connect with other support services, but importantly **a DUSA advocate can help you navigate the university system to take action in this situation**. There absolutely is a power imbalance in this situation where you feel bullied by a member of staff - so DUSA can help you fairly navigate this. \n\nRemember that DUSA are independent of the university - they are not employed by the university in anyway - they are your student association, and act in your best interest as a student.\n\nThe university will take this matter very seriously - allegations such as these are dealt with and the student complaints process is designed heavily in favour of the student. Trust me, I have seen both sides of the process and it is in the university's best interest to protect the student in this process. Just make sure you document everything. \n\nOnce you have gone through this process, there will be other avenues of recourse for you - for example, applying for a refund of fees paid for the unit you had to withdraw from, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* [Student Complaints](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/dean-of-students/complaints)\n* [Safer Community](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/safety-and-security/safer-community)\n* [DUSA Advocacy](https://www.dusa.org.au/get-help)\n\nI also strongly suggest that you start seeing a Deakin counsellor (or if you are already receiving mental health support, start keeping good documentation and have it ready). A Deakin counsellor is also independent of the uni - they are there for you, are free, and know the student complaints and special consideration process well. If you are navigating mental health issues because of bullying at Deakin, a counsellor will be able to assess you and work with you to apply for special consideration, extensions, remission of debt, etc.",

There is support available from Deakin, please access it. You might want to start with [Safer Community](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/safety-and-security/safer-community) who are there for students experiencing concerning, threatening, inappropriate or uncomfortable behaviour. /u/IlllIlllIlllIlI has awesome advice. \n\nThe university has a vested interest in you completing your course and being happy with your experience. A staff member who behaves in an unacceptable way towards students is a liability. If you have a threat in writing from a Deakin staff member, that is [clear evidence of bullying](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/health-and-wellbeing/counselling/topics-to-explore/healthy-relationships/bullying-and-cyber-bullying#what-is-bullying) and is a breach of that staff member's employment conditions. The university does take this kind of thing seriously, and DUSA are also taken seriously.",

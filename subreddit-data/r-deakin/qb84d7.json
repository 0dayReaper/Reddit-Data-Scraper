    "postText": "Hi all \n\nI only need 20% or higher on my final assessment to finish a post Grad business unit. Problem is, during this semester I've had a baby and work and personal life has been so intense. \n\nI just submitted the assignment. I think it's horrendously bad, but how bad would an assignment have to be to get less than 20%?",

            "comment": "A thing to remember is that 50% is the margin of fail/pass. If its bad, it'll probably be &lt;50%. Did you attempt to address each of the rubric criteria? If so then you are more likely the pass.  \nAnother thing to consider is that students that land on the 48 or 49 for a unit will typically have their score adjusted to either a 47, or a 50 so that they clearly pass or clearly fail. Usually class contribution and attendance are factors in this. If your attendance isn't great and your activity on CloudDeakin doesn't demonstrate engagement, then it may influence the unit chairs decision.  \nBased on what you've written, feels like you're a coin flip.  \nIf this is not your final trimester, I'd encourage you to reduce your course-load going forward - as a postgrad you should not be in a position where your other responsibilities put you at risk of failing.  \nSource: Deakin demonstrator and marker 5+ years, current academic year masters student.",

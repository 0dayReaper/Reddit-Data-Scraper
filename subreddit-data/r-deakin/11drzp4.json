    "postText": "Is it usual for the cloud site for a unit to open up and there be no information/schedule for online seminars? One of my units has 5 seminars a trimester, but there\u2019s nothing about when these are scheduled for (also not unit chair welcome message, assessment info  etc). My other unit sites have all this info provided already. Is it worth contacting the unit chair or better to just be patient and wait for the info to be added?",

I emailed the unit chair two weeks ago trying to find out timetables so I could organise childcare and work around it.\nThey emailed me back today and said \"If you would prefer an online version. Then the timetable is not yet available. But for sure they will be in the evening.\"",

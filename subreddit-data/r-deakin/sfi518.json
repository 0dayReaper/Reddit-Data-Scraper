Good part being if you had questions they were available during that time. \n\nMy advice as a disabled student who needs to move is to sit as far back as possible or at the sides of the room. I have always just moved around when I needed and nothing's been said. Most lecturers get were human and we need to move or drink or even eat. My experience has been across the science and design faculties.",

Most seminars will have a short break as well - but just communicate with your tutor and let them know of your needs at the beginning of the trimester. They are all human and I'm pretty sure will accomodate you.",

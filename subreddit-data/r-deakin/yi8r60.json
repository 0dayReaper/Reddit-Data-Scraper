    "postText": "Hi peeps! Sorry for yet another annoying question but does anyone know what would the least difficult Arts major to pick to complete Arts degree within a year? For context, I\u2019m completing bachelor of commerce and Bachelor of Arts and this trimester I have finally finished all the requirements of my commerce degree and have also started completing few units in Arts. Initially I wanted to major in Spanish but because it would take me additional year to complete it I\u2019ve decided to minor in it. I really need to pick the easiest Art major there is to finish the degree by end of 2023. Can anyone who has done any of the Arts majors share your experience on the major you completed and what were the benefits and difficulties of completing it. Thank you in advance!!!",

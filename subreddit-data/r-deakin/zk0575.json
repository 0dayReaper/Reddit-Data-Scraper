Your in the course.\n\n\nAt unimelb you\u2019d need to work very hard to maintain a decent GPA for 3 years, take the gamsat and even then you may not get into optometry. The only way I\u2019d recommended this option is if you got a graduate package (but even then you need to maintain a 75 WAM). I\u2019d also recommend it if your heart isn\u2019t set on optom.",

Although I do hear from some of my friends at Melb Uni that they try to help you pass when you do your final exams/OSCE as opposed to Deakin where I feel like fail rates are a bit higher.",

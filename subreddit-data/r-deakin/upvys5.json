    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI am applying for Deakin next year, and the course I am looking at is offered in person as well as the Cloud Campus.\n\nIs it possible as an in person student to watch and participate in the Cloud classes here and there, or maybe do some subjects in person and some online? I'm a bit worried how much free time I will have because I'm going to need to work to support myself.\n\nAlso, what are the Cloud lectures like? Is there any difficulty hearing the lecturers?",

            "comment": "2nd year eng student here. I'm a campus student at the moment but have friends in the cloud who have negotiated for example to be on campus one day a week - they just let the lecturer know, and all is good. Similarly, if for example I miss a class due to unforseen circumstances, there's absolutely no reason why I can't log on to the scheduled cloud session or watch the recording if it's already been. \n\nNow because I'm a campus student, when there is group work to be done I must do it with other campus students. In these sessions, it's not sensible to ditch a campus session and replace it with a cloud one. That said, I do have mates who are primarily cloud students but nevertheless make the trip to campus on a weekly basis so they can participate in group work as if they were a campus student. \n\nCloud lectures are not an issue in terms of audio quality. They are delivered to a webcam by the lecturer, not a recording or stream of a campus lecture hall. I much prefer in-person lectures because it's easier to speak up and become involved, but recordings or cloud sessions are preferred by some because they can hide behind a muted microphone, pause the recording and / or adjust speed at will.\n\nIn terms of free time, you could always sort out an alternate course plan with a student advisor so you can spread your units out over Tri 3 as well. Even without doing this, there is still plenty of time in the week to hold a part-time job at Woolies, or the local fish and chip shop. I'm personally not too worried financially.\n\nAll this said, I did one unit over Tri 3 last year, enrolled as a cloud student, and was greatly annoyed by the fact that the lectures were held at 4PM while I was working full time. This meant I was forced to watch recordings only. A lot of the other units hold cloud sessions outside the usual 9-5 business hours window, but this one didn't for some reason.\n\nHopefully that's all you need, but if you have any further questions, do ask.",

                            "comment": "I don't know much about other universities - I'm a domestic student that went to high school here and transitioned to Deakin after year 12.\n\nMy understanding is that you can transfer between universities, and that *usually* the units you've already done at your first University are similar to the ones you would have been expected to do at the second, so they allow you to jump in halfway though and they transfer over your credit points accordingly. You may have to take an extra unit or two though in order to catch up on something your first University didn't cover. And of course, you can't transfer halfway through a semester.\nDo talk to someone more qualified than I, though - this is only what I've heard secondhand from one or two people I've met who have gone through this process.\n\nIt absolutely is possible to start off in the cloud at Deakin and transfer onto campus later when you arrive in the country, though. That's no worries. Like I say, you can let the lecturer know that you'll be showing up and they'll be more than happy with that. Then, in future semesters, just enrol into the campus sessions instead of the cloud ones. Boom! You're a campus student now.",

Geelong is still big compared to what I'm used to, but it's not so bad.\n\nGood luck with your applications and further research! I hope you find everything you're looking for.",

            "comment": "Hi! I am currently doing Deakin on cloud campus with Deakin accelerate, so it fits in well with year 12 and work. For my unit the classes are pre recorded so you can watch them whenever you need and is convenient for you. The lectures are held via zoom and you Can attend live ones throughout the week at set times or watch the first one of the week as it gets recorded. Personally I like attending the live ones incase I need to ask a question. \nThey\u2019ve told us that if you want to go to an in person lecture then just email the unit chair or lecturers to make sure there is room and a heads up you\u2019ll be attending at campus but otherwise you can do a mix of both. \nHope this helps :)",

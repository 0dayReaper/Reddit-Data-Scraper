I\u2019m looking to enrol in TS2 and complete it online, and just wanted any advice regarding unit selections, subject difficulty, and anything else honestly. Thank you so much for any help :))",

Keep in mind that there is a new course framework now so things are a little different.\n\nAs for course difficulty, I would rate it as average. I found most units relatively easy, but a few you need to prepare for and take seriously to have good marks. In particular Discrete Mathematics, OOP/DSA and Advanced Algorithms.\n\nHere's what I'd advise personally:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPreparation:\n\n* Learn basic programming, you don't need anything crazy, but knowledge of simple concepts like loops, variables, conditionals will make your life easy\n* Get familiar with Linux\n* Study some basic maths for computer science like set theory\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile in course:\n\n* Secure an internship/ placement ASAP \\*\n* Network, join relevant clubs, meet people in industry, make connections \\*\n* Build a portfolio outside of course work\n* Find out what you really need to know for your planned career\n* Learn practical concepts beyond the course like Git, containers\n* Figure out a course plan well in advance\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* = Do these 2, if absolutely nothing else. They will take your career further more than anything.",

I\u2019m currently studying another degree and wanted to do the comp sci degree in addition to that, and was just wondering how hard it would be to balance my workload.\n\nThanks for the advice on the hard units! I\u2019ll probably underload and do those in easier years of my normal degree. Any other advice on where I can find like unit difficulty and stuff would be much appreciated :))\n\nAre there any other opportunities or things I should keep in mind? For the last year where you have to complete like an internship, is it possible to complete that completely online? What would the hours for that look like and the flexibility? My current degree has like placement years and it\u2019d be hard fitting an internship around that.",

I do not have time for this on top of my full time job.\n\nHowever, because they expect work from you basically every week, you won\u2019t fall behind since you\u2019re constantly checking when the next thing is due. It\u2019s always go go go.\n\nI won\u2019t say Discrete Maths was hard (I have done it before at UNSW and it is harder there but also taught much worse than at Deakin), and I won\u2019t even say DSA was very hard (outside of maybe 1 or 2 tasks). I have experience in programming though so if you don\u2019t it can be tricky, but there are \u2018conceptual\u2019 tasks too where you\u2019re asked to explain how an algorithm works instead of coding it fully.\n\nThere\u2019s lot of help provided by the tutors/staff for the hard units if you have the time to take advantage of those.\n\nUnfortunately there\u2019s no compiler or assembly or operating systems or even just memory pointer related material, which is weird because all reputable computer science degrees will have them (only UNSW and ANU in Australia have \u2018reputable\u2019 CS degrees btw).\n\nPretty happy with it so far though. It\u2019s much more in depth than an IT degree or anything like that so it\u2019s not a bad degree, just maybe not up to like Stanford standards etc.\n\nThey need more majors though. I don\u2019t want to fucking do data science major but the others are robotics and IOT. They need more low level stuff that isn\u2019t data related.",

Those units are not really necessary to study to be a solid software engineer I guess.\n\nThe reality is unless you\u2019re in UNSW or ANU you likely won\u2019t get a better experience than at Deakin. Those top uni CS degrees are also a living hell unless you are top brightest 2% of students with all the time and motivation in the world to study. For everyone else a Deakin CS degree will still open doors.\n\nI would recommend data science as a major though. IOT as an industry is a flop and the way they teach embedded here looks like a joke. Data Science leads to and includes machine learning concepts so even if it\u2019s taught poorly the knowledge will still hold immense value over your career.",

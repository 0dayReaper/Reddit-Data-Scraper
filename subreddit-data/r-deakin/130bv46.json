    "postText": "Hey there!\n\nI\u2019m an American living in Victoria looking to study software engineering (surprise surprise) but due to a number of reasons I won\u2019t be able to start till March. (That\u2019s probably the only time I can start anyways lol) It\u2019s been a number of years since I\u2019ve been in school so I figure I\u2019ll use the time to freshen up. \n\nI\u2019m studying discrete math right now cause it looks hard\n\n I also want to get a head start on programming cause last I did it was in year  10 about 12 years ago. Any advice on what language to start learning and resources to use? \n\nAny advice in what else to study? I have a lot of free time at work to prep. \n\nIf it matters, I have a degree in/my background is nuclear medicine\n\nThanks!",

Additionally, learning Javascript basic web dev helps as well. DM me if u want more details, happy to help out!\n\nIm also around at uni, just started a PhD project so feel free to hit me up.\n\nIn my experience, uni is all about making relationships. Try and chat with your tutors, and dont be scared to ask for help.",

I\u2019ll shoot you a DM when I have more time. \n\nUnfortunately I live in Shepparton and will basically have to do the degree fully remote other than the few days I need to be there. \n\nI\u2019ve gone through uni once already and done a lot since then. At the risk of sounding like a bore but I\u2019m not into the uni life anymore. But I do understand the significance of networking",

There's usually a small number of units available to study in T3, but it might be worth looking into if you are able to swing the time.\n\n \n\n&gt;I\u2019m studying discrete math right now cause it looks hard\n\nKhan Academy is a great resource for a bit of help, and Deakin also do have student volunteers providing assistance specifically for maths.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Any advice on what language to start learning and resources to use? \n\nProbably C or Python. Pretty much everything is built on C anyway, but either would help with fundamentals. I did C for the first three years of mechatronics, then my final year project was using a raspberry to do stuff, so I had to jump across to python.  If you look at the course map for the unit numbers, you'll probably be able to find the unit guides easily enough, which might give a bit of info about the specific languages used in your first year.\n\nGood luck.",

I\u2019d probably advise start with Python. \nPlenty of online resources, free and paid, Code With Mosh has a decent python course for beginners. \n\nI was in the same boat as you, and someone recommended pick one language and master it. I started with C++ and C# and Python were easy. \nBut I think when starting out Python is probably the easiest to learn. \n\nGood luck",

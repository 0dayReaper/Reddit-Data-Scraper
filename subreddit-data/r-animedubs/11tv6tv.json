Some of the jokes grew a little stale over time, but overall, this was an enjoyable watch. If you're a fan of cute-girls comedies, it's probably worth checking out.\n\nNext up, I rewatched ***Astra Lost in Space*** for the 2nd time. There isn't much left to say about it that others (and even myself) haven't said already: This series has one of the best displays of character bonding I've ever seen in anime, a concise story with a compelling mystery element, and some exciting, dangerous scenes mixed with light-hearted comedy for good measure. A fantastic package overall, which I'm glad to own on blu-ray.\n\nLastly, I saw the first half of ***Romantic Killer***. Can't say the art direction or the comedy strike much of a cord with me, sadly. But the premise is cool, and the story is interesting enough to keep me engaged so far. I'm looking forward to seeing to what extent Anzu will actually develop feelings for any of the boys.",

I didn't care much for the two new characters they introduced in the second season and the switch to 12 minute episodes made things feel pretty rushed.  I liked how the first season was kinda about nothing, just the characters hanging out.  And I find that that's kind of the part of shows that I like, and as they have to progress and deal with actual conflict or whatever, I tend to lose interest as it goes later on.  The overarching plots tend to feel underwhelming to me. Anyway, any recommendations for the sort of vibes the first season gave off?",

            "comment": "Got around to watching **Belle**. It was okay. I thought it would be a better show, given the positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and it winning Movie of the Year for Crunchyroll's awards. To summarize, *Belle* is a *Beauty and the Beast* re-imagining - but with virtual reality, grief, romantic side plots, social media, doxxing, viral fame, etc. There are a lot of elements the film tries to juggle, but even with a long 2-hour runtime, a lot of key points are rushed or skipped over. The plot is hard to follow, and the show is mostly carried by the singing and visuals. The big moments are there but with none of the buildup, and the story ends up being cheesy at best. *Belle* also has a difficult time creating an engaging start, with real-life events feeling disjointed and the large cast of characters never properly introduced. After watching it, I had an appreciation for how well other romance movies like *Your Name* and *Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop* introduce their premise and characters so seamlessly by focusing only on the main characters (in the former case) or keeping things simple (in the latter case).\n\nWhat is fun about *Belle* is Kylie McNeill's strong musical performance as Suzu. There is dubbed singing, and it\u2019s good! In addition, the visual effects are stunning. In one scene analogous to a water show, the background effects pop out in such a mesmerizing and detailed fashion - the visuals look like an 8K real-life recording on my 1080p display. (I cannot say the same for the CGI character avatars though; Studio Chizu have a ways to go before they can do CGI as well as Studio Trigger.) The ending is nice too, although it takes a while to get there. The protagonist Suzu ends as a better person, with more maturity and courage, in the same manner as Chihiro in *Spirited Away*. Overall, I like the movie but not enough to justify the 2-hour investment.",

I think the dub is about the best of any I've ever seen, especially the dub for Marin. Her tone and diction are fantastic, reflecting the mood of every situation. It's clean. This is a dub done right. I've never seen one so clear.\n\n***Beyond the Boundary*** is one that I've put off for quite a while. There's nothing spectacular about it and the depiction of what's going on in the animation is more powerful than the dub, not that that's anything to write home about. It's still enjoyable, I think, and is one I'm glad to see got dubbed for a once-over and I'm able to see nonetheless.\n\n***Liz and the Bluebird*** was a huge disappointment. that wasn't the dub's fault, but I was pretty disappointed in that too. I took a lot of exception to that, something that's a seriously unpopular opinion.",

One of those things that I thought would never end.\n\nMusic is supposed to move you or touch you and make you feel something by using it to accent what parts you need to feel more than others. Considering this was largely based on music, I would have hoped that they could have found a way to break away from that soft melodic tone. I know what it's supposed to do, giving me impression of the bird flying away. It still wouldn't have hurt to add something else in. \n\nThe bland watercolor palette didn't touch me as poignant in any way. Both characters were unimpressive. Just like with the music, I do understand that everything was to go along with the plot, but even the emotions that were falling apart for Mizore (\"misery?) This poor girl was incredibly heartbroken. Something could have been done to show even a little bit of that. There was just a lot.",

The film is very different from your typical shonen/adventure/comedy. It is all character drama, and not the crazy kind of drama like in *Beastars*; it is a muted drama \u2013 a drama within the self. Every scene is deliberate but also quiet; the film *shows* rather than tells its plot, and this kind of storytelling may not engage with all audiences. For me, I had the opposite opinion of the various aspects of *Liz and the Bluebird*, bar the color palette. (The characters and objects in the storybook scenes do look too bright compared to their environments.) \n\nThe use of music is phenomenal. The first 5 minutes establish the central motif of the film by playing the main song. In addition, I enjoyed the energetic track that plays during those carefree days when Liz and the bird spend their days together. And in general, the OST reminds me of *Maquia*\u2019s OST, which I adored for its otherworldliness and the melancholy it invokes. The gradual change in how the two leads perform their musical roles plays a pivotal role in the story, and the musical performances themselves are lively and add a much-needed jolt to the film, like in [the big scene](https://youtu.be/lnvpIX_193I).\n\nAs for the visuals/pacing/story, they go together and complement each other, so it is hard to talk about them separately. While I was watching the movie, I did feel the dialogue might not entertain everybody, but for me, the excellent storytelling through the cinematography and audio kept me engaged. The show is subtle; it is always keeping the viewer guessing. A mystery despite not being a mystery. What are these two girls thinking? What do they mean to each other? Who is Liz, and who is the blue bird? &gt;!The show does a great job at misdirection. First, the character design of Mizore\u2019s blue hair causes the viewer to assume she is the bird. Then Nozomi gives Mizore a feather in the first ten minutes, flipping that expectation, and later events moreover solidify that viewpoint. And finally, near the climax, that preconception is flipped back again. Mizore is the one who can \u201cascend\u201d to music school and is the actual blue bird tie-in.!&lt;\n\nIn addition, the show has all these shots of the girl\u2019s faces, their emotions, and their body language that add to the story and make the film so much deeper. &gt;!When Mizore explains her poor performance to some girls, she says she is having trouble learning the song. However, in this dialogue scene, she runs her fingers through her hair, an obvious context clue that she is not telling the truth. The film withholds why she does this until near the climax and keeps viewers in the dark, but it is another mystery for viewers to unpack.!&lt; Another example is when the audio is disjointed with the visuals in one scene. While a bunch of girls talk to Mizore, the camera pans to a seemingly unrelated shot of Nozomi. That is unless one infers this is meant to show Mizore\u2019s POV. The disorientation serves to emphasize and make a point of how Nozomi perceives her friend: &gt;!more as a bestie rather than as one out of many.!&lt; These are just some examples. And all these little details it leaves for the viewer to unpack kept the movie engaging for me.",

Many of my favorite fight scenes not just in SAO, but anime as a whole take place within the span of just 7 episodes. It's one of those rare seasons I could watch on endless repeat and still find it just as exciting every time. **Rating: 10/10**\n\nI've also watched the first three episodes of **Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You** in preparation for season 2 this spring. So far, it's an okay romcom. The opening scenes were really strong, but the overly comedic tones in an otherwise dramatic scene lowered the impact for me as it went on, and while the overall setup is funny, it's also pretty unrealistic if you think too much about it. Still going to keep watching as I've read it's a good, wholesome romance story.",

            "comment": "Recently I've been doing a binge of the Gundam Universal Century series in preparation of watching Witch From Mercury. I know Witch From Mercury is a spinoff and the original timeline isn't required for it, but I planned to watch the series last year, but could only barely make it through the original 1979 series. After finishing Zeta Gundam last Saturday, which I started in February, I managed to binge double zeta (gundam ZZ) by Wednesday. I opted to watch both of those in the sub since there isn't a dub for double zeta and I haven't heard good things about Zeta's dub. Either way, on Thursday and Friday I watch **Char's Counterattack** and **Unicorn**, both of which blew me away. \n\nIt took me a bit to readjust to the dub in Counterattack, but hearing Brad Swaile as Amuro and the late Michael Kopsa as Char was amazing. The art for that movie was also stunning, not that it was a high bar to set over the original trilogy's TV budget and dated look. It definitely felt like the perfect ending place for the original trilogy's story to end off, though there was one part of the ending that was a bit confusing until I looked on the wiki for clarification.\n\nUnicorn was the gundam series I always wanted. The original trilogy was cool, but struggles with pacing and story issue, while still charming for its time the art is dated and the dub situation isn't ideal (1979 is dubbed, zeta's isn't regarded well, ZZ was never dubbed). Unicorn on the other hand was spectacular. It's story was consistent and well with very few plot holes, the art was stunning and the NYAV Post dub cast was excellent, though I would have like to hear returning characters retain their Ocean dub VAs. It's definitely my favorite Gundam series I've watched thus far. That said, I am hesitant to recommend that anyone watch the original trilogy in full like I did just to see Char's Counterattack and Unicorn. Both of those are a lot of fun, but watching the original trilogy in full isn't ideal. While I haven't seen them myself, I would advise anyone interested in the Universal Century (original) timeline Gundam series to watch the movie version of the 1979 series (fully dubbed) and look for the movie version of Zeta Gundam (undubbed). Double Zeta hasn't been compiled into movies as far as I can tell, but it's definitely worth watching for anyone interested in the series, just know it has a rough start.\n\nFrom here I plan to watch Gundam Narrative and Hathaway's Flash before jumping onto Witch from Mercury. I've added The Origin to my watchlist, but I'm not sure when I'll get to that one since I'd like to let some time pass before I dig into it.\n\nStreaming woes: I originally planned to watch Char's Counterattack and Unicorn on CR since that would be most convenient for me. As it turns out, CR has the sub, but not the dub of either, as such I had to watch Counterattack on Netflix and Unicorn, annoyingly, on Funimation. Additionally, for whatever reason episode 5 of the Unicorn dub on Funimation has just the Japanese audio track, so I had to go over to Hulu to watch just that episode, before returning to Funi for the rest. On top of all that, I don't where I got it from, but I thought Netflix had the dub of Narrative, they do not, instead it is on Funimation. Luckily though the dub for Hathaway is still up on Netflix. Usually I'm not too bothered about having to be subscribed to multiple services to watch anime, but this was the most frustrating series of events I've had to deal with and it makes me wish Sunrise/Bandai would just pick a single streaming partner for the franchise instead of this madness.",

This is something I've been wanting to watch for a bit cause I've heard it's very dark and horror-lite despite how it looks.",

I usually can't get into adventure animes at all; it's simply not a genre which excites me. But the fantastic world in *MiA* made it enticing to watch for me.\n\nThe really dark parts only start around episode 8 or 9, I believe. Then the (3rd) movie trumps those parts. And then the 2nd season trumps that. Trust me and everybody else talking about the show when I say that things get *really* heavy.",

I get why she did the things she did, but damn was she annoying. Outfit upgrade for Fran really was a sexiness upgrade disguised as worldbuilding, which, come on, just be upfront about why she has a midriff and not bullshit your way about mobility and shit. Liked it enough to watch S2, but not nearly as good as the other isekai from Fall.!&lt; 7/10\n\n**Shadow Garden:** &gt;!Gold as always. Glad we have a S2 confirm and 8 more episodes left in the dub. Cid is a fantastic actor and he sounds so bored as he just casually breaks the world.!&lt; 8/10\n\n**Tomo-Chan:** &gt;!If I wasn't so far in I would have dropped it already. Misuzu just constantly pisses me off and has ruined all enjoyment I have with the show. Why is she so popular with the viewers anyway? It seems like I am alone in not liking her at all. Tomo as a prince is what I wanted from this and yet I can't even enjoy it.!&lt; 6/10\n\n**Handyman Saito:** &gt;!I really do not remember the manga being this drama focused and it has been killing the vibe for me. It is a very lighthearted, easygoing show, so hopefully now that the arc with the assassin is over I can go back to enjoying this. This next one is very close to where the manga is translated so I will be in the dark soon.!&lt; 7/10 but only just\n\n**Bofuri S2:** &gt;!I like it, but the pace is too fast as they seem to be speedrunning the levels.!&lt; 7/10\n\nI dropped 80,000 gold, but might pick up Buddy Daddies to replace it. How annoying is the kid in that?",

Mushi are like yokai/demons and come in different shapes and sizes. It's very interesting and he tells about their origin, how to treat the symptoms etc. Very SOL, tranquil, slowpaced and bittersweet stories. If you like Natsume or stories about spirits than this is a must watch.\n\n**Ayakashi: Japanese classic horror:** Similar to Mushi-shi but this time instead of one wandering shaman we have 3 different horror-stories. I loved all three of them and was hoping they would expand the first one at least. There is a spinoff but it was not dubbed, so I did not watch that.\n\n**Kino's Journey- the beautiful world:** Just started this one and it's pretty pleasant though not as fun/interesting as Ayakashi or Mushi. Kino just travels around many different countries with her traveling motorbike. Every country has different culture/rules etc and we learn about it through Kino. It's really thoughprovoking and many times I want to choose a side, but offcourse it is never that easy.",

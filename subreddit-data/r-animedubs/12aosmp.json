I love a good tournament arc and, like Cid, I think there's nothing better than a \"seems weak but actually kicks ass character\" so the Bushin Festival is shaping up to be a great arc. Watching week to week will be tough.\n\nAlso, I'd like to applaud every VA in this who had to say \"Perv Asshat\" in a serious conversation without laughing, I don't think I could.",

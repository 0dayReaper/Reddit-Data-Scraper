He looks like a long haired Gojo from Jujutsu Kaisen lol.\n\nAnd finally we get to see Beatrice, who I\u2019m 99.99% sure is the main villainess of the story. She better watch out because the Duke looks to be on a war path right about now. He\u2019s slowly descending more and more into becoming a full fledged yandere, and I for one welcome it.",

Given that Raeliana and Beatrice are supposed to be friends as per the OG story our girl's basing her knowledge on, the only explanation I can see for Beatrice suddenly trying to assassinate her is the classic setup of Beatrice is *also* someone who got isekai'd. Is she trying to \"reclaim\" her place as the protagonist by instigating Raeliana's death?",

So it will be interesting to see if she was always behind the killing or the story was really changed by Raeliana. \n\nIt is interesting because so far it has been shown a few times that the book doesn't need to explain things for them to have a back story in this world.",

                            "comment": "Oh yea, you're right. I totally forgot about that. That would actually be a great twist, if Beatrice had just *always* been behind Raeliana's death to catapult herself into importance and wasn't even isekai'd. I guess the tell will be, as it always is, whether or not Beatrice displays knowledge of things only knowable by having read the novel (like who has the royal seal, which is how Raeliana got where she is). I imagine she'll betray that eventually. Given how this show's rolling, I'd put that scene somewhere in the final arc--which I guess is just about to start if this is a 12-episode cour.",

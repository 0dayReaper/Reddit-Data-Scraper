            "comment": "Despite all the criticism this season received, I personally loved it and thought it was great. Sure, the animation isn\u2019t the best, but the plot/story definitely makes up for it. Rlly loved the OP &amp; ED Soundtracks. And ofc they had to leave me hooked with another cliffhanger at the end \ud83d\ude2d \nAlso glad the entire dub cast returned to reprise their roles. The VAs for the new characters sounded amazing as well. Can\u2019t wait for season 3!! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd",

Anyway AJ\u2019s performance during the tire section was fantastic and I already love the new gang that\u2019ll be the villains of S3 and their theme is so awesome.",

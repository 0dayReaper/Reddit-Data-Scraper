Speaking of Taiju there\u2019s no way Taiju wasn\u2019t inspired by Broly and shoutout to whoever does the sound design for Tokyo Revengers cause they made his punches sound super impactful like Takemichi is get punched by Broly I\u2019m on episode 9 and Mickey the GOAT and Vinland Saga just Peak Fiction across the board.",

I recently watched Paranoia Agent for the first time and I'm actually glad I put it off for so long as I feel like I wouldn't have appreciated it as much if I watched it at a younger age. \n\nAnd I'm almost done with a re-watch of Trigun so I can get into the new series. It's nice to feel that the latter episodes still hit me as hard as they did when I first watched them long ago.",

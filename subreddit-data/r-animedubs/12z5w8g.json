Higurashi (if you can make it past the slice of life stuff), Parasyte, Blood The Last Vampire (I've never seen the reboots like Blood C and etc tho, just the original OVA), the two 80s Devilman OVAs are absolutely brutal and not for the faint of heart,  Kagewani's a short anime with a different animation style, but I really enjoyed the story, and pretty much any Guyver you can get your hands on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut for something slightly different, if you don't know Takena, he's a Japanese clay animator most well known for Chainsaw Maid and a lot of his stuff is horror related and it's absolutely fun and gorey.

Alien Parasites come to earth and take over the heads of some people. The replaced heads can split open and do some body horror stuff, morphing into blades, etc. and they eat humans. The parasites Are just as smart as us, if not more, but are also entirely logical, like an insect. Story starts with an ordinary highschooler getting his arm replaced instead, he ends up having to learn more about the parasites than he bargained for. A lot of somber moments, tragedy, existentialist horror, and if you watch the dub, some absolutely hilarious off-the-wall dialogue. One of the big philosophical things it gets on is, yes, these creatures are eating people, but do we only think that\u2019s horrible because it\u2019s happening to us? After all we grind up cows and pigs for food without a shred of concern. Spine tingling and thought-provoking are the words I\u2019d use. There is definitely some gore, but I see the bigger focus is on the mysteries and themes of humanity in this show.",

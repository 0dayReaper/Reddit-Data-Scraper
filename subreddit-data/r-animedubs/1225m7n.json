It was one of my favorite shows of last year and I hope we get to see a lot more Yor this time around. She deserves to have the same amount of screen time as Anya and Loid imo.\n\nI\u2019m always fascinated how some shows release a new season within a year while other shows such as Re:Zero take several years for a new season.",

They've already lost The Devil Is a Part-Timer and Goblin Slayer to Studio 3Hz and Liden Films respectively, so it would be disappointing but not really surprising if they've ended up losing Re:Zero as well.",

I don't think when he was introducing a rice cooker to Nobuto's head he wasn't expecting he'd end up in a firefight a few weeks later.\n\nThe more details he digs up the more doubt it casts on him, though. With the escort revealing Nobuto's doublecross people can make the interference that the Yakuza or whatever whacked him instead.",

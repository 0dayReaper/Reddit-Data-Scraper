Vivy Flourite eyes song had me emotional at times....\n\nChobits. \n\nNOT dubbed. But... Plastic Memories. Had to mention that. \n\nSteins; Gate certainly got emotional. \n\nDusk Maiden of Amnesia\n\nGirls Last Tour\n\nSchool-Live\n\nID: Invaded.  There's a part that certainly had me emotional.\n\nReLife\n\nSelector\n\nMadoka Magica.  Idk this show had me emotional my first watch ever. \n\nThe Day I Became a God\n\nWhite Album 2\n\nMushi-shi\n\nEF (either of the Ef series)\n\nWonder Egg Priority (with the added note that I never actually watched the last two episodes.

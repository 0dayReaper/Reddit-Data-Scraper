Which is handy if you want to find anime with a certain genre :) You can also find two at once if you click one of the genres first and then use Ctrl F to find a second genre.\n\n[Here is the link for the list of over 2,200 Dubbed Anime - MAL](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Universalx?status=7)\n\n[Here is the link for my profile with the genre shortcuts - MAL](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Universalx)\n\n[Here is the link for the list of over 2,200 Dubbed Anime - AniList](https://anilist.co/user/UniversalX1/animelist)\n\n[Here is the link for the list of over 2,200 Dubbed Anime - Kaize](https://kaize.io/user/universalx1/list/animes/completed)\n\n[Here is the link for the list of over 2,200 Dubbed Anime - Kitsu](https://kitsu.io/users/Emrys/library)",

It appears that AniList gives much of what MAL + anime.plus offers, but with nicer design (offers less overall, but also some nice things that Mal + anime.plus doesn't).",

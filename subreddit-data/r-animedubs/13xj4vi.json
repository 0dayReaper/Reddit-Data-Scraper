However, keep in mind that Sentai's budget, when compared to Funimation/Crunchyroll is much smaller, and they only do this from show by show basis and depending on the director (I believe John Swasey is the ADR Director, he's very likely to cast someone from the Dallas area much like how Mike McFarland is more likely to use California based voice actors in regards to Fumination/Crunchyroll dubs when he's the ADR Director).",

Been a while since I've heard from Blake Shepard, can't wait to hear him with this lead role, and really nice to have Luci Christian, Katelyn Barr and Monica Rial aboard. Now that is one very stacked cast for a lot of the extra characters, I'm pretty sure this dub is gonna be chill yet a lot of fun. Very surprised to see Emi Lo in their first Sentai dub. And yeah, called it on John Swasey directing this.\n\nThat's pretty much it for Sentai's announced dubs. I hope they dub more spring titles, one I would be excited for would be Insomniacs After School. There's Anime Expo coming up in July and I hope HIDIVE gets to attend so they could announce more stuff most especially dubs.",

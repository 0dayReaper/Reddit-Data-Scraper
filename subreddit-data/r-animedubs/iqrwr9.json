He could\u2019ve easily picked something more popular but he still remembers, what is basically his breakout performance as a voice actor. It just shows how amazing Fate/Zero is.",

I watched an interview he did for jojo well after he probably recorded his Jotaro stuff.... they were quizzing they VA\u2019s about the show and I felt so badly for him because you could just tell he was drawing on this VAST database of past characters to try and remember details.

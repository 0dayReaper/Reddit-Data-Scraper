Thanks to this kind of strategy, they missed really good shows to dub this past seasons such as Bocchi the Rock like you mentioned, Angel Next Door, Magical Revolution and now Skip and Loafer. Instead, CR dubbed those forgettable seasonal cheap fantasy/isekai shows instead of these titles that became popular or highly rated.\n\nI swear isekais are a priority for them. They dub most of them despite how boring and uninteresting they can be, while shafting every other genre.",

It would be one thing to say we will dub this at some point, but not until home video release. Instead all we get is silence. We have to sit in frustration and worry they might not get dubbed.\n\nSome shows that are lesser quality not just Isekai that are poorer quality get dubs over greater quality shows. Not complaining that they get dubs period. They need to find a way to turn out more dubs. It seems they just throw darts at a board randomly to dub shows. Rather than making an effort to study or look at source material. Heck have some staff read a volume or a little of a volume to decide for dubs.\n\nHonestly if they don't improve in any regards In this matter. As much as it pains me I feel some compulsion to cancel my yearly subscription. This would pain me to do do as a huge anime fan. Still if it needs to be done to teach them a lesson so be it. \n\nThough they can stop me doing this if they just dub The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten. Along with Skip and Loafer, Mix, and, Vampire Dies 2nd season. Only then will I stop complaining. Right now they are making too many mistakes and it makes me mad.\n\n I even wrote to them which was hard to find a way to do so. It takes a lot to frustrate me to write. So I hope one of the employees at Crunchyroll sees this thread at passes on the frustration. If they choose if ore enjoy losing my service for at least a little while.\n\n Maybe I will just do monthly. I can always enjoy the source material from companies that respect good material unlike Crunchyroll at the present.",

They somehow managed to not dub every single new show that I like and follow.\n\n* Yuri is my Job\n* Skip &amp; Loafer\n* Yamada 999\n* Nee-san\n* Caf\u00e9 Terrace\n\nAnd they still haven't dubbed Birdie Wing s1, let alone s2. I even picked an isekai this season and last season, a genre I normally don't watch and rarely enjoy. CR *loves* dubbing isekai, but between MagiRevo and now Nee-san, I managed to watch what feels like the tiny fraction of isekai that they haven't bothered dubbing.\n\nIt's reached the point where [these are CR's subtitles for a small handful of shows early last season](https://i.imgur.com/idwIPCR.png) and they aren't reliably choosing to dub the kind of content I want to watch. So then I asked myself \"What value is my subscription providing to me as a customer?\" and decided the cost wasn't worth it. I'll happily pay for dubs of shows I'm interested in. I'll begrudgingly pay for *good* subtitle-only releases. I'm not going to pay for bad subs, and I'm not going to pay to fund dubs of shows I don't care about while the shows I *do* care about routinely remain undubbed.\n\nI regret to say it, but I *miss* Funimation. At least when Funi got a license, you could expect that it would be dubbed. Outside of Aniplex streams and a *very* small number of non-Aniplex shows, if Funi got it, Funi dubbed it. That reliability was nice.",

If you're gonna blame anyone, blame the guy who's actually running the company, not some other guy who only works for them as a VA and producer and thus has no control over the company's dubbing decisions. Just because he produces dubs doesn't mean he actually gets to decide what gets dubbed and what doesn't.\n\nJesus Christ, you're an even bigger fucking idiot than I thought. It's bad enough that you used to shoehorn dub credits on ANN with no reliable proof whatsoever (sometimes they were even based on gut feelings alone), as well as constantly whining about backlog dubs never coming out, which only showed how much of an impatient little brat you really are, but now I find out you're so fucking braindead that you can't even be bothered to look up who the real CEO of Crunchyroll is? Get a life already you prick.\n\nAnd don't even think about telling me to \"watch my language\", because I couldn't give less of a SHIT about your feelings on swear words.

Dubs would need to become more popular to increase production support for dubs, but the lack of good support makes it harder (and more frustrating) to watch dubbed.",

Demanding that they stop dubbing X type of shows cause its not one I want / Am in favour of. While completely ignoring the bigger picture of how things work.

If someone doesn't desire more of something they enjoy then that just means they don't actually enjoy that thing. There's not a crazy amount of anime like there is TV shows, even more so for dubbed anime. People who don't watch TV shows and only watch dubs don't have anywhere near enough content to entertain them for an anime season. It seems to me more so that you might have some sort of problems or you don't enjoy anything in your life. People should always want more, if they don't, they get nowhere in life. Obviously entertainment is a luxury so it's not the same but you don't instantly just have to be complacent with so little because it's not a necessity in life.",

The two main problems are as I cited above in another comment in this thread\n\n One lack of communication if shows not dubbed at the present will ever get them in time for home video. At least have the decency to let us know. Two quality shows are being put down the list of priority over other shows. See my comment higher up for more clarity.\n\nThe Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten was one of their hot shows last season trending on their Switch App. Yet no one as gone and said. We made a mistake not dubbing it sooner. Let's fix that now. \n\nThey sent several tweets about the show on their Twitter account while it aired. The posts received lots of likes. I sent an email and tweets about it to them about it getting a dub. I still send a tweet about it now.\n\n I love the novels, as have many other people here have said the same thing about wanting a dub. Yet all we get is silence, and it is frustrating for Angel Spoils along with other great shows.",

It's you. I'll copy the comment text here to save anyone the click:\n\n&gt; **Welp there goes seeing Yuki Yuna S3 DUBBED so much for the 'they will will dub it on home release dont worry' some of ya all like to spout off while you simp for Sentai getting titles these days or should we just keep huffing on copium believing that Sentai actually gives two fucks about DUB fans ?**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Thanks for fucking nothing again Sentai.**\n\nThat was you, 11 months ago, when you were a moderator for this community, raging that Sentai Filmworks didn't dub the third season of a show. A show where &lt;checks notes&gt; they already hadn't dubbed the second season. A show where they *didn't even dub the first season*. The season 1 dub was done by Bang Zoom, contracted by PonyCan when they were still operating in this market. Sentai scooped up the show as a license rescue. \n\nLook, I get it. It sucks when a show you like doesn't get a dub. I feel exactly the same way. I've got no shortage of salt over Yuri is my Job. But for you to rage about it in the way in which you do, calling others in this community \"simps huffing copium\" because Sentai didn't finish a dub that *they never even started* is something else. Even in *that* thread, someone was telling you to shut up, because you did this constantly. It brings me back to what you originally said in your parent-level comment in this thread:\n\n&gt; You have become the most spoiled, impatient group I have seen amongst the anime fandoms, its actually just sad seeing how utterly impatient &amp; downright toxic dubbed anime fans have become.\n\n&gt; [...] how bad some of you all have made the dub community over the past few years with this bitching whinny impatient mindset anyway that's it feel free downvote me cause facing the reality of how the real world works for some of you folks is to hard.\n\nThis is you. You're whinging about you. The things that you said. I promise you, you will be better as a person if you can realize that. Are you *solely* responsible for this type of negativity? Of course not. Did you heavily contribute to it? Absolutely.\n\nAnd if you're wondering \"Wow, it's oddly specific that Verzwei has this example ready to rip from a random home release thread nearly a year ago\" that's because *I already complained about your outbursts and toxicity in a private discord back when it happened* so it was easy to source. [link 1](https://i.imgur.com/8ATLYsG.png) and [link 2.](https://i.imgur.com/3qCUQ21.png) *Edit: And I'm pretty sure I did report your constant negativity and toxicity through proper channels back then, and nothing was done about it, so yeah I complained about it elsewhere while visiting this community less. It was never my intention to have a public spat until you decided to put this community on blast on your way out the door, for shit you yourself did.*",

Just like Ben Diskin refusing to return to his role on My Hero Academia in season 6, they'll just replace any actor that refuses to return or strikes. And if it is a new show, they just won't cast anyone striking. A vast majority of their actors would need to strike, but most of the Tesas-based voice actors that Crunchyroll employs probably aren't even union members because all the work they do is non-union, so that isn't going to happen.",

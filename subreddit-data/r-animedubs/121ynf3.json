Also good to hear Matt Mercer back as the voice of the Council of Humanity (though, of course, it hasn't been officially been confirmed). Funny though, Devola and Popola are in this episode a bunch but not talking just yet, will have to wait and see if Eden Riegel returns in time.\n\nLove the skits at the end and Kyle in particular with those, good stuff.",

I see on her ANN that she's been ADR Engineer for a lot of shows, and assisted directed in Heroines Run The Show. Im sure this is gonna be a good one!\n\nMaddie Morris is as solid as you can get. Always love to see her in another lead. And I'm very happy and excited for Molly Zhang. I believe this is her first main lead as well? I know I've enjoyed her in many of the stuff she's in, like Laid Back Camp, Shikimori, and MOre than a Married Couple. So I'm even more excited for this.\n\nPlus, I just want some comfort, adorableness,  sweetness, and fun. And I bet this one will deliver for that.",

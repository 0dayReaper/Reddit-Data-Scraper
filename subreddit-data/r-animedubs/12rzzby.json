    "postText": "**Synopsis from MyAnimeList:**\n\n&gt;The Private Aichi Symbiosis Academy was originally a high school for high-class girls. When it became co-ed, the girls, out of fear, asked to be permitted to bring weapons to school. When that was enforced, a five-member vigilante corps-like organization called the \"Supreme Five Swords\" was also formed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After many generations, the five swords eventually became a group which corrected problematic students, and the academy started proactively accepting such students in order to correct them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nomura Fudou was sent to this school after being part of a huge brawl. What will he do when the only options he has after enrolling are being expelled from that school or being corrected the way the rest of the male students there were...by being forced to dress and act like a girl! \n\n[Previous Anime Dub Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/search/?q=author%3AAutoModerator%20AND%20title%3AAnime%20Dub%20Discussion%20-&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sr_nsfw=)",

            "comment": "It was alright I guess. MC was definitely the biggest selling point and his interactions with some of the girls aren't half bad but the story itself reeks of harem from the 2000s where all the girls are kinda obvious stereotypes, plenty of plot points involving girls jumping to the worst conclusion to just make every thing harder. That whole 'Female on Male violence is funny' is on full display here along with lucky/unlucky pervert moments. \n\nEnding was lame in that it just set up a season 2 that will never come. \n\nDub was about on par for most sentai dubs. Nothing outstanding.",

            "comment": "This was a show I had no expectations for but when Sentai puts a Premium Edition BD for sale for &lt;$20 USD there's a good chance I'm buying it blind, or maybe just based on the dub cast. The dub for this was pretty great, and I'll always remember a particular line adaptation, I *want* to say it was the second episode.\n\nI don't know if we're supposed to spoiler tag in these threads or not so I will just in case. &gt;!The scene features the protagonist and the female lead in a compromising position in her room. True to anime the whole thing is an accident, but another character walks in on them and assumes that the protagonist is a predator. In the original dialogue, the girl merely yells out \"PERVERT!\" in Japanese, which is \"HENTAI!\" but, for comedic purposes, the original audio bleep-censors the middle of the word, so you hear \"H\\*NTAI!\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Sentai's dub was like \"We have this audible censor bleep, *we're gonna use it*\" so the dub line gets changed to \"YOU F\\*CKER!\" It works so well because the dub (and that character in particular) are not prone to swearing, so it almost comes out of nowhere, and then the show keeps that joke alive by having a bunch of side characters gossiping and murmuring about the ~~h\\*ntai~~ f\\*cker during a scene transition.!&lt;",

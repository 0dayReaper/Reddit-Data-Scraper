            "comment": "Back in September before the start of Mob Psycho 100 S3, the lead VA from the first two seasons, Kyle McCarley, put out a video explaining that he had been replaced for the show. He had tried to ask CrunchyRoll to meet with SAG-AFTRA representatives to discuss the possibility of some form of a union contract, without any binding agreement ending to be signed. He felt the need to do so as he has become very involved in the union over the past few years, especially when it comes to dubbing work. CrunchyRoll opted to turn down his request and recasted him and any other VAs from the LA cast that stood in solidarity with him. When this happened there was a lot of talk and anger on twitter and several VAs made statements directly supporting him.\n\nFans are now concerned that CrunchyRoll will recast LA dubs in order to avoid the union issue coming back up, which hasn\u2019t happened since.",

Since most of the work is \"gig\" work, most of the usual benefits (health, retirement, etc) are provided by the unions themselves, not the employers as in most other industries.",

Only new titles to be dubbed will have Texas talent at their in-house studio in Coppell, although Chainsaw Man and MHA S6 were exceptions and allowed remote casting and recording because both shows were very hyped.\n\nI think CR enforced their in-house studio recording only policy because they want to utilize their new facilities and equipment which they spent tons of money on and have a return of investment by producing as many dubs as possible from their new studio.\n\nAnd no, CR didn't outright ban non-TX talent from appearing in their dubs, they are just required to literally fly to Texas and audition/record in-person at their studio if they want to be part of new shows to be dubbed. Unfortunately, most of them prefer to do remote recording for health and safety or logistical reasons, that's why you'll feel like these outside talent were blocked from appearing in new shows, unless that particular show is outsourced to a third-party studio which still allows remote recording like Sound Cadence, Studio Nano and Okratron5000.",

I just find it insane how him willingly opting out of the role turned this entire fiasco into this unnecessary hate campaign against CR (even if they deserve criticism for certain things) and created this fear for LA recasts.\n\nSomeone already mentioned it in the Konosuba thread, but these people REALLY need to move on from this whether they like it or not. If CR does union, great, if they do not too bad and move on.",

Its like how Faye Mate tweeting once that she understood what Kyle did turned into people and lets call them news sites running story's that she wouldn't work with Crunchy anymore and bringing that narrative up every FUCKING TIME, oh wait she was in latest Iruma dub episode on Saturday a non-union project commissioned by Crunchy so yeah, wonder how they will twist that now or other fucking fear baiters without any proof saying the reason the L.A cast of Cold Steal didnt come back after all was a union protest move by them months after the fact and after announcing publicly they would return and making tweets stating they where excited etc.\n\nLike I said elsewhere in other comments who the fuck do they want getting these anime's if not Crunchy the company giving us 95% of all anime dubs every season ?",

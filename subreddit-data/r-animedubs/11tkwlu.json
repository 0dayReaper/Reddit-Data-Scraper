Is there any animes that have similar scenes in tone to theses examples.\n\nMy Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU: S1E12 \n13:09-14:14 &amp; 16:16-1749\n\nThe Rising Of The Shield Hero: S1E4\n9:15-19:50\n\nI couldn't find the right words to describe this but SNAFU did it for me. \"There are people around you who hurt when they see that you're hurting\"\n\nI find these parts very relatable. \n\nI appreciate anyone willing to put in the extra work. I couldn't find these parts on YouTube.",

            "comment": "Purely based on the line you quoted, there's a scene like this in one of the last episodes of *Darling in the FranXX* (around episode 22, I think) where &gt;!Hiro decides to rush out into space after finding out that that's where Zero-Two's consciousness went. Goro sets him straight by telling him that his selfishness and lone-wolf mentality is hurting all of his friends on the squad.!&lt;",

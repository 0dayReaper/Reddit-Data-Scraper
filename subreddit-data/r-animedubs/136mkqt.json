I have run out of shows to watch with her, so I would like some recommendations.  \nMild to no fan service, she doesn\u2019t mind action shows, mild  blood.  \n\nWe don\u2019t mind subs, and she only has a Crunchyroll account.\n\nHer favorite genres are fantasy, slice of life, comedy.  She also likes stories about strong female characters.  \n\n\nNo troll recommendations please.\n\nHere are the anime that we have watched:\n\nAvatar The Last Airbdender.\n \nSpy X Family.   She covers her eyes during the blood scenes.\n\nLove Live School Idol Project \n\nLove Live Sunshine \n\nMonthly Girls' Nozaki-kun \n\nPreCure (Healin Good, Hugtto)\n\nSleepy Princess in the Demon Castle\n\nKuma Kuma Kuma Bear \n\nK on!\n\nGabriel Dropout \n\nThe Demon Girl next Door \n\nWelcome to Demon School!

            "comment": "**I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level** is pretty similar in tone to In the Land of Leadale.\n\n**Ascendance of a Bookworm** is a fantastic show that's an Isekai with light fantasy and is SoL-ish with a young, strong (character-wise) female lead. It can be serious/mature with some drama, but not too violent, and nothing I would consider more than PG-13/TV-14.\n\n**So I'm a Spider, So What?** is another Isekai with more of an adventure theme. MC is female (also a spider) with a strong independent streak. This one definitely has some violence, but most of it is monster on monster. It does have some human violence as well, especially as the story progresses. Again, nothing beyond PG-13/TV-14 I don't think.\n\n**The Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent** is another Isekai. This one is a little more laid-back, but not quite SoL I suppose. It has a strong female lead (as well as a couple of good female supporting characters). It's a romance with a bit of adventure that is definitely reverse-harem adjacent (still pretty wholesome imo).\n\n**Castle Town Dandelion** is a supernatural SoL with a female lead (but also an ensemble cast of main characters). Very sweet and wholesome with good energy and plenty of comedy. Some mild fan service (mostly implied instead of shown iirc) at the expense of the MC.\n\n**Shadows House** is a bit darker and more mature than some other ones on here. A good mystery/psychological show with plenty of strong female characters (including the MCs).\n\nLastly **Fairy Tail**. This one might be too fan service-y and not a great fit genre-wise since it is a battle-shounen. I'm mostly recommending it because my sisters liked it around that age, and Erza Scarlet was one of their favorite characters. Despite the fan service, the main themes of the show are super wholesome (found family and power of friendship and all that jazz), and while the battles can be a bit ~~viscous~~ vicious (like most battle-shounen) it doesn't usually get too graphic or serious.\n\n**Edit** Thought of a few more I don't think I saw mentioned:\n\n**Drifting Dragons** is a great one about a draking (think whaling, but dragons) ship. Female MC who is pretty strong-willed with a great personality. Other strong female characters too. A bit violent (it is about hunting after all), but it has pretty good messages about responsible hunting/harvesting. Also has some mouthwatering cooking sequences. The show has a really gorgeous aesthetic and general vibe. One thing that might be a knock against watching it with a 13 year old girl is the brothel scene. There's nothing explicit or even fan service-y iirc, but there is a character (and associated plotline) about one of the girls who works there (but isn't a \"working girl\" yet) that might be something you'd rather avoid.\n\nEdit: spelling",

            "comment": "My niece is around the same age! She loves anime but she is more drawn to shounen and action.\n\n**Zombieland Saga**: Comedy idol anime. A personal favorite. Despite the zombies it's not gory or scary, but there is a lot of slapstick. A great female cast, no fanservice, and lots of great themes for a younger person. **PriPara** is another one she might like if she likes idol anime + PreCure.\n\n**Yona of the Dawn**: Action anime with a great female lead who develops a lot over the show. I haven't seen it in a while, but I don't remember it being scary, and there was very little blood.\n\n**Yuki Yuna is a Hero**: A somewhat more mature take on the magical girl genre. A bit more action and drama focused than Sailor Moon, but not as intense as something like Madoka. No fanservice, no gore. Similar magical girl options are **Princess Tutu** and **Cardcaptor Sakura**.\n\n**The Devil is  Part-Timer**: SoL comedy with some action. Genuinely funny, little fanservice, good female characters.\n\n**Tomo-chan is a Girl**: SoL comedy, great female characters, very mild fanservice.\n\n**Fruits Basket 2019**: Starts off as a SoL rom-com, becoming more dramatic overtime. Plenty of good female characters and great themes for a young person. No fanservice or gore.\n\n**Azumanga Daioh!**: Slice of life comedy, one of the first \"cute girls\" shows (similar to K-On, but even less plot), very little fanservice (usually played for comedy). There is a really perverted teacher though, and while the audience is clearly supposed to be grossed out by him, it's understandable if you don't want to watch something like that with your niece. **Nichijou** and **Lucky Star** are other good options.\n\nSome other relevant options to consider:\n\n**Ouran High School Host Club**: RomCom SoL that has in all honesty aged kind of poorly, but it's very funny and it has some great moments. Main character is super relatable. Fanservice is sort of \"the point\" since it's a host club but it's nothing excessive.\n\n**The Ancient Magus Bride**: Fantasy with some SoL elements, I hesitate to put it because it has some mature themes and blood. Nothing too extreme but you might want to look into it before you decide to watch it. The main character is a young girl who develops nicely over the show.\n\n**Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood**: There is some blood and a lot of scary scenes but it's nothing too extreme. Fantasy shounen with comedic moments and plenty of strong, important women.\n\nAnother action anime with a female lead I really like is **Deca-Dence**, which is...hard to explain without spoiling anything but it's a dystopian anti-capitalism/labor action/adventure show with comedy and some twists and turns. Female lead is essentially disabled but finds ways to work around it because when wants to fight. There's some blood, but no fanservice.",

The show was aimed for 13 yr olds at first but the anime/manga has been running for a lot of years now so the age rating for each season has gone up. \n\nDefinitely after season 2 it will probably not be appropriate especially the last seasons which in terms of violence had a big jump. It's been a while since I've watched first season but the only \"fanservice/nudity (which is censored)\" was at the end of the first season.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess that yes I could not be appropriate. To get a better picture it be wise to check before watching. \n\nI just added the show just in case because it was a very popular anime when it launched with people around 13-16 years old.",

Most of them the MC somehow manages to naked tackle the main girl, and the ones even more perverted than that are just straight acting out kinks",

            "comment": "Honestly most of the good ones are ones you've already mentioned.  One that does come to mind is Good Luck Girl.  General gist is that this girl has too much good luck so the god of bad luck basically comes down and tries to balance things out lol.  Mainly a comedy show with the main cast being composed of all girls aside from a few guys (one character is pervy at times FYI but the rest of the show is great)\n\n  Little Witch Academy is a great one for young viewers especially girls since its basically like Harry Potter but with young girls.  Fantasy magical girl stuff with light hearted situations overall.\n\nLastly, Yona of the Dawn which  is a romance show that takes place in ancient china so its kinda fantasy.  After certain events occur, a once young princess must runaway with her bodyguard who must protect her as they venture out seeking others.  Personally, I like how she starts off as a weak pampered girl who learns quickly to grow up and actually stand up for herself.  Technically there is a bit of blood early on due to someone being assassinated, but aside from that, dont recall there being any more.",

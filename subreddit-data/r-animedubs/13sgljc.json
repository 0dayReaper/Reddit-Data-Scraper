    "postText": "With HIDIVE releasing the dub of Oshi no Ko, the most popular anime of the season, it would now be a good time for Crunchyroll to answer back by dubbing a show of their own that was a hit, Bocchi the Rock would be the obvious choice. If the show does get dubbed, who would you have as the cast? Mine would be:\n\nHitori - Macy Anne Johnson or Bryn Apprill\n\nNijika - Jill Harris\n\nRyo - Madeleine Morris\n\nIkuyo - Amanda Lee or Kristi Rothrock",

Thanks to this kind of strategy, they missed really good shows to dub this past seasons such as Bocchi the Rock like you mentioned, Angel Next Door, Magical Revolution and now Skip and Loafer. Instead, CR dubbed those forgettable seasonal cheap fantasy/isekai shows instead of these titles that became popular or highly rated.\n\nI swear isekais are a priority for them. They dub most of them despite how boring and uninteresting they can be, while shafting every other genre.",

Same frusteration with **Love Live! Superstar!!** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd yeah, skipping Bocchi and NOT going back after the fact and doing a backlog dub is a massive letdown, it seemed like a guarantee. And speaking of which whay happed to CR doing backlog dubs? They were doing so amazing for a season or two and now nothing... Sorry, got fired up.",

I was happy they did it right before my trip to Japan in January because I went to the Fuji World Heritage Site where they went, and took a pic of the same places they went to in it. The site even advertised that the show had scenes there.",

It took them nearly three whole seasons before they dubbed Nagatoro and that turned out to be one of the best dub jobs I've ever heard imo. Rather they take their time making a fantastic dub than rush one out.\n\nIt's probably harder because they may want to dub the music. Personally I'm fine with them leaving the music as is, but there's probably a delay to finding a voice cast that can sing as well if that's what they're doing.",

Honestly the Animation and colors of this show was really beautiful and well designed, the animators did put a lot of hard work, Now with all episodes out I\u2019ll definitely have to binge watch all of this.\n\nI\u2019m certainly hoping this reboot will get a Season 2, we haven\u2019t seen Milly yet.",

The animation is simply beautiful and captures the spirit of the original manga and premise of the series in a really cool way. The action scenes are so much more dynamic than the original series, and is honestly one of the best looking shows out there. I mean FFS half of Attack on Titan and Chainsaw Man use similar animation techniques. I get complaints about some CGI anime, particularly when they don't stylize it the way that this show was or other show that blend 2D with 3D, but this one looks great.",

Took me awhile to watch it again after. Maybe they didn't want to add her because she's too fun and goofy for the show?\n\nIdk Maybe she replaces Roberto now after what happened? They'll meet her early season 2 and her and Merle become friends?\n\nI hope you're right and they didn't just erase my favorite character for whatever the hell dumb reasons",

Easily imo the most cinematic and consistently well-directed show of the Winter season (albeit with some strong competition from individual Vinland eps). And with the Studio Orange's 3 for 3 track record, at this point I will just tune in to whatever they choose to do.\n\nProbably my favorite new dub of the season as well. Everything really just clicked for me and the dub team should be really proud of the work they've done!",

I did drop the anime initially because I wasn't too convinced about the changes they made from the Trigun 1998 anime. But I have to say that **some** of the changes/additions made a lot of sense and enriched the story. I haven't read the manga, so I can't say which is most loyal to the source. (I'm very picky about what is considered canon, so I'm still not convinced about some of the changes they made)\n\nOne of the things that threw me off was the framerate of the CGI; It sometimes felt like it was too low.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, this has been a very good anime.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next season, and from what we heard at the end (while Meryl was talking through the radio), it seems that Millie Thompson will be joining the group next season.\n\nI'd give this anime around a 8.25.",

Plus, the CGI and it\u2019s low framerate didn\u2019t help with my initial opinion. However, the show just started gradually getting better and then had an amazing final arc to end the season.",

That, combined with my absolute distaste for cgi in anime, makes it hard for me to be objective about this series. Every time I see cgi, I think that it would have looked so much better with regular animation. Like for me, the Trigun movie captured perfectly what modern Trigun should look like. Anyway, I'll try to give it a shot when I see how season 2 does, but as it stands, I wasn't impressed with the bits and pieces I saw here and there.",

The animation is honestly fantastic and the action scenes are directed so well that it really does justify the use of CGI. To me this, Dorohedoro are great examples of how to do a CGI anime. It captures the look at the 2D animation. This version of Trigun is a great reimagining of the source material and IMO it expands and enhances a lot of the elements of the original show. It's definitely worth your time if you are a Trigun fan, and it's good to support a show where there seems to be a lot of love for the source material in there.",

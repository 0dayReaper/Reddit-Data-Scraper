I know the Kingdom of Science has had one technological advance after another. And the more tech they keep inventing, applying, and further growing, they've grown from a primitive stone community to a whole wide resource network for Senku. And each new advance, from using sonar to catch fish, to Chrome applying the same concepts to make a metal detector, to making roads, each and everything is coming together so fast. \n\nIt's easy to take all these things for granted nowadays in the age of tech and smartphones. But seeing it for the first time in the stone world, man it just keeps reminding me why this show is a top 10 all time for me!",

That blast would've gone through her teammate's back, but Aerial saved her.\n\nThe end of the fight reminds me of the same from John Wick 4. You arrogant asshole, Chuchu didn't shoot.\n\nDon't know what Shaddiq was thinking. He basically screwed Miorine over and somehow expected her to jump into his arms. lmao",

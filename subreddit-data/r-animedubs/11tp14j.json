That show is criminally underrated. I'm still hoping that somehow they come back to it for another season.",

I don't mind a few, but it felt overloaded with them.\n\nFor Real Girl, the ending felt a bit convoluted and I didn't like some of the secondary characters, particularly the two \"friends\" that were always kind of insulting and mean to the MC. I don't understand why they all continued to hang-out. Especially after &gt;!the one jealous pretty guy literally tries to destroy his life when he falsely claims to police that he tried to kidnap his sister and then spreads rumors that he's a pedophile at the school. Like WTF?!&lt;",

I like the direction it's going in.  If you asked me the same question in season 1 I'd say I like it, but not as a romance anime.

Cause I\u2019ve heard the anime was super rushed compared to the manga (I have not read it), which I can totally see because I thought the first 4 or so episodes were pure master class for a romance and the ending was a huge payoff, but somewhere in the middle it totally felt like a ton was missing even as someone who hasn\u2019t read the manga. I did really enjoy the vibes of horimiya so I would love to read the manga eventually",

Until he has left the town/city, and the ones he proclaimed that he loves. Is when they decide they can't be without his love. A true love story in every episode. This one has to be the best love story/ romance / comedy.",

I've read the manga to the current chapter, and the story is just so good with a tonne of character development. \n\nIt has none of the usual rom com tropes like love triangles/harems, and the main character isn't flirting with like every girl that decides to talk to him. The story itself is nicely focused on the two, but the side characters are all pretty great, and they all are rooting for the two main characters.\n\nTldr In short, it just makes you smile. It's cute, it's fucking hilarious and does lewd humor without really going over the line at any point into ecchi BS. It's not all fan servicey, although there's definitly some with nagatoro teasing senpai with it. The relationship between them is heartwarming and actually has a lot of progression pre-confession.\n\n Top tier rom com, and my all time favorite of the genre. I've watched it maybe 7 times since seeing it 2 months ago(i tend to watch an episode before bed every day cause i know whats gonna happen and it puts me in a good mood), and read the manga twice thru. It's also not as predictable as many rom coms. They don't tease them about to kiss all the time only to be interrupted and I've actually been shocked after some chapters.",

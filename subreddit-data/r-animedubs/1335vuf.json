            "comment": "I know we've made the joke before, but with all the dialogue between Gabimaru and Sagiri about accepting emotions not being a weakness of a person, but it makes them a human being almost sounds something Hori and Miyamura would discuss sometime together after school. But def is a lesson that I feel everyone could relate to, swords and blood trails flying or otherwise. \n\nOn top of Gabimaru and Sagiri battling each other, I loved the voice work with Alejandro and Marisa this ep too.",

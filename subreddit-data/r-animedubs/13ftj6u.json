All dlc was another separate purchase on an already 60 dollar game, and it didn't deliver much. The tf2 campaign was sick, and I would say one of the best fps campaigns to ever grace this earth\n\nHowever, hacking a whole community to spread awareness has the opposite effect. Just look at the people sitting in the middle of a highway potentially blocking emergency vehicles and that one dude who was gonna go go jail. Inconveniencing people to spread awareness will nearly always backfire. Cause they are now aware of your issue (our issue for the climate change) but also viscerally hate you\n\nThe people still playing titanfall at that point were mostly just people clinging to a 5+ year old game with barely any player base. I tried hopping on once after a while. I'd been gen10 on both titanfall with over a 3 kd, instant stomped because the only people playing were the same sweats that played titanfall and nothing else since it came out. Save titanfall would have never worked because that requires an influx of new players and a sbmm that would correctly sort them, which titanfall had neither",

Felt this may be a great time to also mention how awesome of an Anime Lain is.  It's from the 90's so it might not be for everyone.  But even the Wachowski's have cited it as part of their inspiration for the Matrix.  So... It definitely has one hell of a place in the lore of cinematography and anime.\n\nThose that have seen Lain, might understand just how ridiculously ironic this hack is.  It's pretty funny.  Let's All Love Lain &lt;3\n\nFor those that don't want to read or haven't been to MAL yet, they expect to be back online around 9 PDT (12 EDT)  No user information was stolen, and nothing will be lost.  They will restore to a previous backup before the hack and close the method that the hack was perpetrated.",

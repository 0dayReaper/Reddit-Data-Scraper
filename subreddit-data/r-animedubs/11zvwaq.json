    "postText": "I've been putting together a list of anime original stories that people can watch without having to worry about dub quality. No adaptations from manga or novels, I'm even leaving games off at the moment (though those tend to be loose adaptations).\n\nI'm always interested in finding anime original stories and I tend to enjoy them best when I don't have to worry about keeping up with the subtitles as well.\n\nCurrently, this is my list. I haven't watched all of these fully nor are they all my favorites, but I have seen most of them and those I haven't I've verified that the performances are consistently good.\n\n* Cowboy Bebop\n* Space Dandy\n* Eureka Seven\n* Code Geass\n* FLCL\n* Kill la Kill\n* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\n* Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt\n* Angel Beats\n* Eden of the East\n* Neon Genesis Evangelion\n\nLet me know if there's any others you think deserve to be on this list!",

I remember some tweets by Clifford Chapin back when it was airing that demonstrated a real passion for the show from the team, and it went from a show I dropped a few episodes into something I looked forward to every week.\n\nNowadays I look back with a mild fondness for the show but I'll never forget what made me jump back into it.",

Anime comedies like Golden Boy, D-Frag, Baka and Test, Nichijou, Lucky Star, and Kaguya Love is War are also legit, as well.\n\nAnother one that needs to be mentioned is Haruhi Suzumiya. Considering who was in it, and how good the show is, it should get more credit for having a good, English dub cast, among other things about the show.\n\nThey can also be added to the list.",

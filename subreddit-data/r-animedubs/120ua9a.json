Tear balms are common healing items in the game.\n\nAnd that is your Legend Of Heroes lore for the day.\n\nAlso Tallion's a dick. I thought he had shot her with his gun at half power, since orbal firearms operate kind of like railguns, and you can tune down the energy to make the projectile slow enough to not penetrate a body. But nah, he actually put a bullet in her gut.",

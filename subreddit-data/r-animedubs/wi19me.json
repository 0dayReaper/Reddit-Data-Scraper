When reading this arc I was able to do everything in one sitting no issues, watching the season 2 episodes were just so hard to get through will the stupid padding added to it while the important story content got sidelined. \n\nAll the extra Rishia content made no sense especially when they cut out the scene where a character explains why there is a need to follow her. The first fight with Kyo she was just randomly more powerful than literally everyone and if you only watched the anime it's not explained why she is. It felt like they forgot who the main character of the series was just to add in a new female relationship with Rishia and Ost.",

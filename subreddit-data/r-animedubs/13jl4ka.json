YouTube has a few episodes up with the original dub (I believe animax did the original offhand.) It's actually not terrible. But it feels weird.",

Initial D season 1 was first dubbed by Studiopolis in the early 00s, with Americanized names and redone music. Funimation redubbed it about a decade later.",

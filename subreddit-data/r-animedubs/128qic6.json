            "comment": "I believe in between the bargaining and sadness stages of grief for Nagomi is insanity. But at the end of it all, I'm sure Ranko can smile from the heavens and be proud of the maid Nagomi has become. And they dubbed the last song too!\n\nAkiba Maid War is one of the most insane, ridiculous, over-the-top, \"so stupid it shouldn't work but it works\" animes I've ever watched. Def got that Quentin Tarintinto feel to this but in anime form. I think what makes this dub work is that as ridiculous as this show is, the dub team had to be 100% commited to have as much fun and embrace the stupid as possible, and it's made it one of the most fun Sentai dubs I've ever watched. Easily a top 3-5 Sentai dub in my opinion, they went all out for this one, and it was a blast. \n\nFantastic work by the entire dub team. So many eye rolls with the number of animal puns in this script. And amazing work from the cast all and all. (My only crit I have with this dub is that they didn't update the cast list after every episode except for   \nZoya's and Okachimachi's VA.)\n\n**Theresa Zimmerman** as Manager was easily the funniest (and probably most incompotent) character in the show. Really enjoyed **Katelyn Barr** as Zoya, and a great addition to the pigsty. **Christina Kelly** as Shipon is spot on. **Cat Thomas** is growing more and more into one of Sentai's best staples with the reliable Yumechi. Ranko was my favorite, and **Chaney Moore** was excellent. And I loved seeing Nagomi's evolution as an Akiba maid. **Alyssa Marek** was Ham-tastic.",

            "comment": "Man, I loved this show so much! Hilarious, violent &amp; wholesome all in one. \n\nIdk how others feel about the ending but I liked it and thought it was ironic seeing that it was the &gt;!two assassins Panda &amp; Axolotl who ended up killing Nagi essentially ending the cycle or war!&lt;. At least that\u2019s how I interpreted it. What I do know for sure is that everyone was getting tired of her shit and hatred for one can unite all lol.\n\nI can also appreciate the attention to detail with Nagi\u2019s ammo count. That was exactly six shots during the last moments in the cafe.\n\nI couldn\u2019t pick my jaw off the floor when &gt;!Ranko died but at least best girl 1a. got a bitter sweet ending. I felt so relieved when she showed up 18 years later(also a nice touch) alive and still rocking the hairpin her partner gave her all those years ago. Not to mention the three Nerula fans still visit and support Nagomi!&lt;\n\n I had no clue what this show was about going in but that just made the experience better the more you watch. This was one of the best anime originals I\u2019ve ever watched. Cast was great too\n\nI\u2019m so glad Sentai/HiDive dubbed this because i don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve given this top tier show a chance otherwise. Highly recommend this one.",

            "comment": "That was actually a pretty fitting ending. Nagomi basically ended the maid wars without any blood on her hands. Panda got some redemption, even.\n\nThe show was insane, which kind of helped with the murder. A few dead maids might be uncomfortable. Two dozen dead maids is hilarious. Despite that, it had some genuinely good drama. \n\nGreat art and animation from PA Works. Overall fun show. Just wish we got to see what happened to the other maids besides Nagomi.",

            "comment": "The moe moe kyun finale of a bloody insane series! Nagomi, who followed Ranko's and Michiyo's example, the essence of moe, as well as Nagi's reign of terror ending with her death, were the catalysts to a new and reformed Akihabara. The finale unfortunately did not show what happened to the rest of the crew at Oinky Doink, the manager and Okachimachi, as well as Ranko's murderer and what exactly became of Creatureland's demise in the timeskip. There needs to be a sequel or at least an OVA to explain these, I doubt it though, but still a pretty good ending. 36-year old Nagomi looks lovely! I'm glad she continues her passion of being a cute maid serving her masters, and I know Ranko and Michiyo are smiling down on her from heaven. And well I'll be, the dub finale airs a day before Nagomi's birthday, so happy birthday to her.\n\nOne of my favorite shows last year and I'm glad it got picked to be dubbed so I could rewatch it. Cast was solid, I liked Alyssa Marek as Nagomi and she gradually did pretty well, and I indeed felt how Chaney Moore as Ranko really did justice on her stoic, serious yet friendly and caring personality, now my favorite role from her. You also gotta hand it to Katelyn Barr for perfecting that Russian accent on Zoya, brilliant performance. Next, Christina Kelly's Shiipon was simply awesome, her voice really blended well with her gyaru attitude, and I couldn't think of any other voice for Yumechi than Cat Thomas, besides, I correctly predicted Cat would voice her! Lastly, how could I forget Teresa Zimmerman as the financially irresponsible manager? She was really good too. Bonus points for this dub for dubbing the songs, and it turned out great! One downside though is that the rest of the voices other than the main characters remain uncredited even though I recognize a few ones, hopefully we get to see the updated cast list.\n\nThat's two of Sentai's fall dubs done, and HiDive will likely announce their winter dubs at Anime Boston next week which is guaranteed to include Part 2 of Danmachi IV in one of the slots, so I'm looking forward to their big announcements from the con.",

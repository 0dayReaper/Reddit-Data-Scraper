    "postText": "Back around 2004-5ish, I watched the OG Digimon Adventures when it aired on Cartoon Network's Toonami. It was English dubbed, but the characters went by their original Japanese names (Taichi, Yamato, Takeru) and all the OSTs were in Japanese (including the Digivolution theme). But the dubbing was a bit awkward because I'm pretty sure the cast weren't native English speakers (intonations were a bit off, and some pronunciations were unusual). From memory, I think they may have been Japanese speakers with the way they would pronounce their own names.\n\nJust wondering if anyone else remembers watching this particular dub version (and whether this version still exists online)? I can't seem to find anything online regarding this particular dub cast and I kinda wanna rewatch it for the nostalgia (and bangin OSTs)\ud83d\ude14\n\nFor reference, I was living in South Asia at the time, meaning we got the Indian Cartoon Network, so I wonder if this wasn't so much of a universal experience?\n\nEdit: Two commenters have confirmed that I'd watched the Filipino-English dub! I honestly am not sure why the Indian CN decided to air that version but oh wells lol.",

Check whether it's this here in glorious 24p (you can count the pixels): https://www.vidlii.com/watch?v=rQTQq3fEGc0&amp;pl=g_IaSreUxwX\n\nAnimax generally tried to hire native English speakers for their dubs -- they just didn't hire professional actors, so the quality of acting can vary drastically.\n\nIf it's not that, then I have absolutely not clue -- there was a Hindi dubbed version too, apparently, but I expect you would have remembered that.",

You're correct lol, I remember Agmon and Gabmon \ud83d\ude29 (I incorrectly thought those were the Japanese pronunciations, cos iirc in Japanese, sometimes the \"u\" between certain letters become silent, like how \"daisuki\"  is pronounced \"daiski\")\n\nAnother commenter also confirmed it's the Filipino-English dub, with a link to the videos as well! \n\nI'm just glad I wasn't imagining the whole thing \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

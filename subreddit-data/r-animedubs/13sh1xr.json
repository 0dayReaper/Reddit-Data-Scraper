Especially Sinclair. \n\n**Oshi No Ko** was great I\u2019m excited. \n\n**is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon season 4** returning has been great. The script and voices to me are so mature and you can feel the character growth over the last few years. High stakes. \n\n**Hell\u2019s Paradise** again the voice acting has been phenomenal. It\u2019s like they took Horimiya and made it an action anime\u2026 the action sequences and the chemistry between all VA\u2019s has been good. \n\n**My Clueless First Friend** tear jerker the last two weeks. The emotional aspects have been greatly delivered. \n\n**KamiKatsu** Weidenheft kills it. Her role as a cute small angry god has been perfect. She embodies that sparky attitude. \n\n**The Legendary Hero Is Dead** Fajardo and Tipton were absolutely comedic this last week. The way they tried to emulate each other this last week was probably some of the funniest scenes from all the shows available.",

You can't really say anything about it.  It's far better saying nothing about it.  Having no clue what it's about.  And just... Watching.   \n\n\nIs it wrong - Yeah this show has gotten better as it's gone along.  And this season it really feels like it's \"getting it.\" So many shows when they run more and more seasons it feels like the go the opposite way... I'm glad this one seems to be getting BETTER.",

It's easily my favorite of the season, but to be honest I may not have watched it if I knew *nothing* about the show. The synopsis had me thinking it would be something else entirely, and comments from manga readers telling me the true genre (drama/mystery) is what intrigued me enough to check it out without spoiling anything about the story.",

Unless you have a problem with some terribly contrived coincidences to move the plot along, it's definitely worth your time if you're a romance fan.\n\nI also rewatched seasons 3 and 4 of ***Aggressive Retsuko***, and I'm almost finished with season 5. It continues to be a delightful series, and I really appreciate how each season has such different themes and plot dynamics. Although the final arc in this latest season (&gt;!Retsuko being recruited by the hilariously named Party of Rage!&lt;) feels a little bit like a rehash of a similar situation in season 3 to me. But other than that, I have no complaints. Looking forward to finishing it tonight.",

I loved learning the different sides of the demis, what made them unique compared to their mythical counterparts, and how they go about their lives. They felt like real, connectable people, despite being a demi. Nothing too high stakes, but just enjoyable SOL goodness.\n\nHikari (Brynn Apprill) is still my fave of teh show because of her energy and spunkiness, something that Brynn just plays marvelously. But dammit, Ms. Sato (Morgan Laure') comes in an extremely close second. But overall, the main cast was fun: Cris George, Sarah Wiedenheft, and Terry Doty.",

            "comment": "This week I've been catching up on some series I fell behind on.\n\n* Revue Starlight\n   * I meant to skip through the main series before watching the movie, but ended up just rewatching the whole thing over the weekend. It really helped me remember what I liked about the series and the dub overall. The movie itself was a joy to watch, though the ending confused me a little.\n* Girls und Panzer\n   * Caught up to the 3rd das Finale movie on Wednesday. It was fun, but I think the whole das Finale series will be more enjoyable as a binge watch once its done since each installment ends during a match with a few months to a year before the next part.\n* Oshi no Ko\n   * I was really looking forward to this series for the past few weeks after hearing the hype for it and its really solid just off the first ep. Of course having a feature length first episode will do that, but there were several twists and turns in it that I think would have made the show harder to get into in it if the same content was done over the first 3-4 episodes. Also, I was really impressed by the dub thus far. Sometimes Sentai dubs can be complete misses or other times they're just alright. Its nice to see that this one has a strong start and even includes some newer talent in the leads.\n* The Quintessential Quintuplets\n   * I picked up the movie yesterday morning and it was great. I will say that the first half or so was a bit slow to me, but once we got to \"the choice\" I got pretty invested. As for who won, during S1 I definitely didn't think they were seriously in the running, but they grew on me in S2 so I'm happy with how it turned out. That said &gt;!there was a scene at the end where Fuutarou remembered waking up to find the sisters trying to decide where to go on vacation, but it was totally played off like a dream ending for a second and man, I had a few choice words about the creators for doing that.!&lt;\n* Code Geass: Lelouch of the Resurrection\n   * I've been meaning to watch this since it was put on CR last year, but never found the time. I remembered it was an alternate timeline and so I originally planned to watch all the recap movies where they make the changes, but in the end I just skipped through them looking for the changes and new scenes. As for the movie itself, I have mixed feelings. On one hand, it had some awesome moments to both see the old characters and hear the dub cast from the original series, but on the other a lot of the main plot felt really confusing and, at times, nonsensical. I didn't hate it in the end, but it feels like a weird movie to come out and it leaves a lot of questions open. I feel like I heard at some point that the movie was originally meant to be a series of movies, but production got wonky and we only got the one or it was condensed into one.  Overall though, it was definitely enjoyable enough for a returning fan, but I'd be hesitant to tell anyone they had to watch it. Also, though we haven't heard anything beyond the announcement to my knowledge, I'm looking forward to the new TV anime they announced a few years back, hopefully that comes out soon.\n\nTonight and this weekend I'm planning to rewatch Mob Psycho 100 before finally watching S3. I protested the original run because of the Kyle McCarley situation, but at this points its been long enough that I'm fine with getting it over with.",

The plot though is nothing to write home about, definitely. A B-movie plot. Lelouch's 500-IQ plays needs more set-up, and the male antagonist ultimately plays no purpose. I like how the movie shows the other side of facing &gt;!time travel!&lt;, and the ending doesn't ruin the OG ending. That's good enough for me on a tacked-on sequel. *Resurrection*, for sure, feels more like a fanservice movie than a necessary sequel to watch.",

            "comment": "Most of my past couple weeks were spent watching a lot of SUB backlog.  Felt like I was running out of dubs to watch that I was really interested in watching.  (And I usually try to watch no more than 3 ongoing shows a season.  I prefer to binge show.) Rascal does not Dream of Bunnygirl Senpai was one I finally got to and it was amazing.  EASY 10 from me.  (And I really don't give those out much.) The fact it doesn't have a dub with another movie coming within a month is just depressing --- Soooo bypassing sub shows I've watched... let's talk about the dubs.\n\nOshi No Ko - Ok, so I didn't watch the sub like many here so my first experience was the dub.  And... I also went into the show blind.  I've been trying to avoid talk and spoilers.  I knew pretty much the base of base level information about this anime other than... It's clearly the hit of the season.  And WOAHHHHHH was I floored with that first episode.  And that twist.  WOW.  WOWOWOWOW.  I totally get the hype too.  I also thought the Dub was perfectly fine.  It worked for me.  I definitely look forward to more!  This show looks like it's going to be one hell of a ride.  I definitely think the right way to go into this one if you can is to know pretty much nothing about it.\n\nIs It Wrong to Try to Pick up girls in a dungeon? - I'm pretty much caught up to where the show currently is.  And am watching weekly.  This second half of this season has just been... Awesome.  One of the issues with this show in the past is that there are SO many characters.  And can be so much going on.  I think it's at its best when it focuses on it's core characters.  Limits how much is going on.  And really focuses.  And putting Bell and Ryu (arguably the two most compelling characters on the show) in a really ridiculously bad situation and seeing how it plays out has just been awesome.  I've been loving it.  This may be the best arc of the show so far.  In a show I've always thought was fun but not very memorable.\n\nMegumin - The previous episode was pretty good.  I'm definitely ready for megumin to get on questing.  The first half of this season felt more like a slice of life than anything else in terms of tonality.  I'm ready for her to get a move on.  So... The direction of the show seems to be picking up if nothing else.  This show wasn't exactly what I expected.. But I'm enjoying it none the less as a \"fun little show.\"\n\nPrison School - This show seemed right up my alley.  But... I watched the first episode like... 4 years ago maybe?  And I was just like.  Nah.  This seems like I won't like it at all.  Well.  I was wrong.  I finally gave it another chance and binged it over 2 days basically.  It was awesome.  The show definitely picks up.  And the humor of this show is right up my alley.  It's ridiculous.  It's VERY ecchi all the time.  And it's extremely self aware of how ridiculous it is.  If you like ecchi, sexual humor, and just ridiculous over the top humor in general. With a show willing to push boundaries even into the uncomfortable.  Yeah.  This show is it.  I really enjoyed it.\n\nI think I finished Tokyo Revengers Season 2 early this week (may have been late last week. I don't remember.) Anyways I'll add it also.  I personally liked it MORE than the first season.  I'm not sure why exactly but I like how we're finally getting somewhere with the story.  I felt like the MC was less of a pushover this season and is actually showing some growth.  And I like the new characters they introduced.  I definitely wanted more when the season ended.  \n\n\nDream Eater Merry - I  had never even heard of this one, but the premise sounded interesting to me at least... I watched 2 episodes yesterday and it seems interesting enough.  Doesn't seem like something that's going to blow my mind or anything... But the first couple episodes were intriguing enough that I'll watch the whole thing I imagine.  We'll see.  So far at least the basic concept of dreams and reality merging or being able to go into dreams or dreams being able to come into reality is a cool enough concept.  There's some mystery here and Merry seems like an intriguing character.  We'll see.",

            "comment": "I finished watching **Ya Boy Kongming** earlier this week, really enjoyed it. The middle/end of the series dealt a little more with the dark side of the entertainment industry, so it reminded me of Oshi no Ko in that respect. I wasn't a fan of the way they handled Kabetaijin's situation - I'm glad it turned out okay for him in the end, but &gt;!Kongming dosing his drink with medicine could have been dangerous and they should have called him out more for that. I also thought they let Azaelia's manager off too easy with how much he was exploiting the band.!&lt; The main characters were all really likeable though. Eiko's friendship with and encouragement of Nanami was a highlight, and it was fun to see how Kongming's military strategies applied to Eiko's goal of advancing her music career. Plus, Eiko's songs were beautiful, and the OP and ED (especially the ED) are so catchy that they're still playing on repeat in my mind. *Rating: 8.5/10*\n\nAlso started **Dr. Stone season 1** hoping to catch up and add another anime to my spring lineup, and I liked it much more than I expected. The story is reminiscent of the kind of live action sci-fi survival adventure shows I watch, with a very exciting first three episodes. I could have easily binge watched more, but I'm saving the next batch for tomorrow.\n\nAnd of course, the premiere of **Oshi no Ko**. I was impressed as a fan of the sub - the dub VAs did a great job, and most of the voices fit their characters really well. Even after watching it last month, the movie-length first episode was just as amazing the second time. Now it will be the second show I'm following dubbed this season, in addition to **Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear season 2** (which is even better in dub with the extra bear puns and the awesome performance by Yuna's VA).",

            "comment": "Watching **Akiba Maid War**. The first 3 episodes are a riot, and I liked what I saw so far. *Akiba* has this crazy energy; it's so serious but at the same time comedic and with tons of action. The contrasting mix of cute and dangerous make for some hilarious juxtaposition. The casting is good; the main character's voice takes getting used to, but Sentai nailed it with Ranko, the serious maid. Chaney Moore never breaks out of character, and her deadpan seriousness as her character talks about being a cute maid is so funny.\n\nSaw the lost dubs of **Perfect Blue** and **Paprika**. It's my second time watching the movies, as I saw them both subbed (due to the aforementioned licensing hell). The former is about an idol coming to terms with her transition to being an actor, and the scandalous acts she has to perform as one, while she is being stalked by one of her fans. The latter is this dream-world story where someone steals a technological device that lets people access their dreams - kind of like *Inception*. \n\n* *Perfect Blue* is a trippy horror popcorn flick. The transitions leave you wondering if what you saw really happened, and looming stalker threat creates a tense atmosphere. The set-up presents an interesting conflict about how low of a bar one has to stoop to be successful and whether the career choice actress Mima made is the right one. However, the ending doesn't resolve the main inner conflict, so I felt it was lacking in that regard. The character art and animation also look dated. (I have been spoiled by Ghibli movies and *Cowboy Bebop*). \n\n* *Paprika* puts you in this dream world. (Does anyone want a *Wonder Egg*?) There's this cop that, with the help of his dreams, comes to terms with his past, and I liked how complete his character arc resolved. I do wished *Paprika* kept up the mystery for longer and had better motivations for the antagonists though. The animation is improved in this later Satoshi Kon film. Paprika (the character) glows when she transforms into Tinker Bell; and when she flies throughout a fantasy setting, it looks immersive as the camera follows her. Both movies do an excellent job at messing with your sense of reality, although I prefer *Paprika* for its improved animation and the main character arc. [Content warning: both films have uncomfortable rape scenes.]",

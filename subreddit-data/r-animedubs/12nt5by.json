Right now I'm watching Black Clover and I'm committed watching this till the end, so I just wanted to ask for some tips to help me out.\n\nThank you.\n\nOptional questions(Not needed, but important)\n\n1. How's the Fanservice/ are the Waifus pretty top tier?",

            "comment": "Its all about the story arcs.  By breaking your watching up into chunks that match major (or minor) story arcs you can just pretend that the season is over and come back to it once you are ready to watch the next season/arc.  Unfortunately I can't think of any Anime that makes it clear which arc the episode is a part of without watching said episode so knowing ahead of time is tricky (Fairy tale has a little of this, but only during later seasons).  Maybe you could set a number of episodes to watch and then keep watching till you get to a good breakpoint.  Black Clover is a little tricky though as it has more or less two primary overarching arcs (I won't spoil but the big first one is LONG) so even the smaller arcs within which could be considered the \"missions\" have continuity from previous ones so finding a breakpoint is tricky.  \n\nFor me, as long as the show is entertaining enough I tend to just watch till the end without stopping (except for sleep, food, and work) so I don't know how helpful my suggestion will be.  \n\nAs for fanservice/waifus if you are talking about Black Clover I would say that there is some fanservice (depending on your definition of Fanservice Vanessa is pretty much always there) but it is mostly about the people not their looks (Asta is very, um, fixated on the Sister so he shows no attraction to anyone else thus no ogling ladies or bathtime shenanigans, not that he doesn't appreciate that Noelle and the other chick are nice girls).  There are a few hotsprings episodes so yay for that but nothing too much.  One beach episode too, though that is shut down pretty quick since they were not there to relax.  \n\nNoelle is VERY Tsundere which can be endearing to some or annoying to others but I liked it.  Since the show would often show how she really feels it got to be less of \"SERIOUSLY NOELLE?\" and more \"Yeah but what you really mean?\" so yay for not just \"this is one rude B dislike her for her personality\".  Don't want to spoil the other chick(s) but the \"romance\" portion is almost always \"this chick is in love with Asta but can't show it/doesn't want to admit it and Asta is oblivious anyway\" which endears him to them more.",

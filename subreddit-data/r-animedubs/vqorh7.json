Still, it is very much just an average power fantasy where all the side characters get no development at all and just exist to circlejerk about how cool and powerful the MC is. Which is fine btw, power fantasies are very enjoyable at times.\n\nImo, the main thing going for it is that the art is good and the fights are cool. If you go into it just looking for some great action &amp; set pieces and not looking too much at the story you'll probably enjoy it.\n\nHopefully, the animation is good because if it isn't I can see this being a massive flop.",

    "postText": "[(Confirmed by Pokemon.com)](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/part-3-of-pokemon-ultimate-journeys-the-series-is-coming-to-netflix)\n\nThe concluding arc will have 15 episodes, comprising of episodes **19x118** through **19x132,** concluding the Masters Eight Tournament arc. \n\nNotably, this count does not equal the number of episodes left in Season 19, as there are four episodes after that, plus the special denouement miniseries. It\u2019s possible that those may be combined into one more batch, or released under another name.",

SOL shows are about everyday mundane things and watching characters react. \n\nThough I too have been frustrated with this show, and that includes season 1. The problem that I see is that the writer never took his own premise that seriously. This show is basically a run of the mill high school romcom. The characters getting flustered at holding hands or seeing each other's backs while they're undressing, and the like. The premise is that they're actually adults and they're really married, but they don't act like it. If you went in blind and were told that they're first year high school students who got stuck living together for some wacky reason like in **More than a Married Couple,** the show would be just as believable and play out exactly the same way. They act like they're 14 years old, and the fact that they're drawn to look like teenagers doesn't exactly help either. Nasa looks like he's about 11 years old.\n\nWe've been seeing the same old high school romcom tropes and scenarios play out hundreds of times every season for years. The beach episode, the summer festival and yukatas, the hot springs, finals week, being nervous about the first time holding hands, the nose bleed crap when the guy sees the girl in her bikini the first time, and dozens of others of well trodden tropes. Any one of us could probably name 20 anime's right now off the top of our heads that have all those same elements. **TONIKAWA** had a really unique opportunity to skip over all that by making the initial premise be that they're adults and they're married. That opens up so many kinds of stories that romcom animes never touch on, and it's a shame that it just went back to the well of high school romcom tropes and had the characters act like they're still kids.",

If you're going to make a show where the main couple is actually married and working real adult jobs instead of kids in school who just started dating, make the show actually be about a married couple working adult jobs. If you're not going to do that and instead just rehash the same old high school kids who just started dating tropes, you might as well just make them high school kids who just started dating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe someday someone will make a show that actually uses this premise properly and fully. Show them talking about having kids, are they going to move to such and such town for his new job offer or stay where they are to be closer to the parents, do they spend their money on a new car or upgrade from a house to an apartment, getting together with old high school or college friends and seeing how they turned out, dealing with the new girl or new guy at work making some advances and turning them down because they're married, learning how to fit in their old fun hobbies into adult life so they can keep the bills paid, etc. Actual adult couples dealing with actual adult couple stuff is almost entirely untapped in anime and there are a ton of stories not yet told that could be through that premise, but instead we get hot springs episode #7,409.",

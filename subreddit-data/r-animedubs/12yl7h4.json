And when Ultraman Blazar starts in July, it's getting a Simuldub!",

Been watching the Z dub as my first proper exposure to the main series (outside of this anime) and it's such a fun time so far (that it makes me forget my usual issues with the uncanny valley that comes with live action dubs). High recommend to anyone in this thread who wants to give it a shot.\n\nHell, I'm still mad there's been absolutely no sign of Shin Ultraman coming over to where I am in Australia. Really frustrating.",

Once Tsuburaya settled all of that, they *instantly* said that they wanted to focus as much energy as possible into western expansion.\n\nIt's a shame that Toei hasn't really been putting the same effort in when it comes to Kamen Rider and Super Sentai.",

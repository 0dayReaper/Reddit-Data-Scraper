Every time I watch a sub I wonder if Japanese people really sound so over the top when they are angry. Or happy. I have no idea.\n\nBut when I listen to a dub I can tell there is insincerity in the acting. And I can also tell it's the same voice from another anime or weather the voice is straining to sound the way it does.\n\nPeople who only like subs just don't realize that japanese voice acting is likely just as awful. And what they actually prefer is reading so that they can imagine the dialogue is more real or even perfectly executed.",

It was mostly due to how much they just didn't give a shit about how much they were butchering the story and intent of any given scene.\n\nNowadays, there's so little difference between the translations that if anything you could rightly say you're doing yourself a disservice by watching a subbed version if a *highly* visual medium. You're gaining nothing but losing a fair bit.\n\nI was watching the new Bleach TYBW subbed (just couldn't wait for the dub) and in one scene I think it was Ichigo and Renji were about to eat and the Japanese dialog was of course 'itadakimasu' and the translated subtitle was \"let's dig in!\"...that is NOT at all what itadakimasu means. So those sub purists can kiss my whole ass with their 'the subbed version is more accurate &amp; authentic' nonsense.",

They fit so hand in hand, perfectly enhancing the experience, as if they were made for each other.\n\nLikewise, the dubbing is brilliant, well done, excellently portraying everyone\u2019s unique personality the way they did, and honestly, the dubbing could\u2019t\u2019ve been done any other way without greatly affecting the overall story.\n\nEach voice actor portrayed their roles in the show brilliantly, and they all contributed brilliantly in creating the aesthetic appeal that is wholly unique to this show.\n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t want it any other way.",

The last scene of the final episode is a perfect example. Watch it back to back (dub &amp; sub) and it becomes impossible to unsee",

My wife's a super fan of Komi and I've never heard her complain about a dub before but she practically hated how Netflix handled it's dub, so I'm assuming this may follow a similar trend. If you're just looking for a fun show to watch dubbed go for it, you won't miss much, but if you're looking for super accurate translations and want to nitpick subtleties then why watch anything dubbed in the first place?",

You ever watch an old Japanese movie where they dubbed over, and the English voice ended but the persons mouth is still moving? Or vice versa? Well this is something that happens sometimes it takes longer to say a word or a few words in Japanese then it takes to say the same thing in English.  Now when they do the translation for subs and make the subtitles they are litterally translating word for word, so yeah if you are trying to use the subtitles(not translating text objects only) for the purpose of closed captioning it\u2019s going to be off.",

And given that Japanese does not translate 1:1 to english for the most part...  That can result in translations being very different depending on the translator.  ALSO...  Dub scripts tend to localize things.  Because written language can often sound quite a bit different than spoken language due to the nature of it. (I'm not sure if that makes sense.. But I hope you understand what I mean.)\n\nI personally feel like it's far harder to make a good dub script than a sub one, for the sheer fact that subs don't need to localize or deal with how spoken dialog can/will sound to a native listener.  Whereas dub translations do need to. (Dubs translations also need to deal with laying out jokes in ways that match the intention that subs really don't have to.)\n\nNetflix and some other services tend to provide the SUB script even for their dubs when they show subtitles.  It's really quite annoying honestly.  I usually just turn it off because it's a distraction.",

Most will bake it in to the video itself, though that\u2019s been fairly inconsistent in recent years. It\u2019ll be missing quite often on Crunchyroll, sometimes being added later to episodes. Other sites will give the option to select individual preference, such as HIDIVE with \u201ccaps\u201d, which are specific to text-on-screen subtitling. \n\nIn my experience, anime streamers can fall into two camps. Those who won\u2019t have subtitles for a dub and those who have subtitles for dubs, except oh wait, it\u2019s just the English subtitles for the sub, so it doesn\u2019t match the dub.\n\nLike, Crunchyroll will have separate subtitle options for each audio language. The English dub audio maybe doesn\u2019t have any subtitle options. Netflix is the latter camp. They have a single subtitle settings list that applies to every audio language. So when you select \u201cEnglish\u201d, it\u2019s almost certainly going to be for the sub and not the dub. I can\u2019t quite remember, but the \u201ccaps\u201d on Netflix might be tied in to the subtitling, so if you want to see text translated, you\u2019ll have to have the subtitles turned on for the sub, while watching the dub. \n\nAny pirating site could either rip the subtitles from whatever place they steal from or do their own subtitling. If they use a home video release, then they\u2019re more likely to have the correct subtitles that match the dub script. It\u2019s a crapshoot though, given it\u2019s unregulated and unpaid nature.",

It\u2019s a common flub up I\u2019d say. \n\nNetflix doesn\u2019t label it as \u201cEnglish-for-Japanese subtitles\u201d. It\u2019s just \u201cEnglish\u201d. If your default is to watch things dubbed, that doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s unusable for new people or those that have forgotten.

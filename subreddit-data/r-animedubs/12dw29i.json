Ray is an above-average protagonist for this genre IMO and the voice cast was excellent too. Everything else was a lot less good sadly. The story felt pretty average, the animations were okay at best, and the backgrounds were kinda meh.\n\nThe fight seems, especially the last one with Ray, were also pretty disappointing overall. They didn't do a good job of showcasing everyone's powers and they just weren't done very well overall.\n\nI'd probably watch a second season if they dubbed it, but not read the source or watch if it was sub only because the voice cast carried on this.",

But the sheer ridiculousness of some of the scenes saved it to be a tolerable show. This is a series you could feel that the dub cast had fun with the material despite it not being the best material to work from.",

Not particularly innovative (though the magic system did seem interesting), average art/animation, generic story, forgettable characters.\n\nEven the one part of the show that seemed pretty cool, the fight between Amelia and the lightning chick, turned out meh in the end when Amelia abandoned her cool chaos butterfly powers and just started throwing fists. Even more egregious was that she won against someone who specialized in melee fights.\n\nThe whole bodybuilder/muscles thing was probably there to make the show interesting and quirky, but it just felt awkward.\n\nVoice cast was good, at least.",

I honestly feel that several shows received dubs this season that did not deserve it over others including this one. I see some in their upcoming season that do not deserve it including over sequels.\n\n I even defend Isekai a lot, but it seems they are just some average ones that are getting dubs this upcoming season. Two that really deserved dubs this past season were Angel Next Door Spoils me Rotten. I wrote about it to Crunchyroll. It is even a well selling light novel by Yen Press. You can look at the online sales figures as could Crunchyroll.\n\nThe Vampire Dies in no time did not get a dub yet and it is a sequel. They might get dubs later, but who knows? I even wonder if they might not release stuff on home video? Frankly, I am worried that they are licensing shows without any research into their quality when they decide to dub them.\n\nI know everyone has their favorites and I am not trying to say these shows are bad. Just that the number of shows being dubbed is dropping. Either Crunchyroll needs to up their dubbing capacity or make better dubbing decisions. Hopefully the former not the latter. If they do release Angels Spoils on home video without a dub or not at all. Along with the state of other shows dubs. I feel I will have to write them again and cancel my subscription for awhile at least if this problem persists. I have defended some of their actions during the merger, but this feels really concerning now.",

I'm surprised they didn't edit their English VAs at the end.\n\nIs it me or is Stella's VA at the end Megan Shipman?\n\nI know it's impossible to happen but I kinda want a 2nd season.\n\nI wonder if anyone can edit the ending with Ray and Ariane with What I've Done by Linkin' Park since it kinda fits that scene.",

All of the side characters here were very generic or cringe. The few good characters  had almost no screen time.\n\nI watched the entire season in a single day (waiting for it to get better) and it's a 4.5/10 to me at best, that's being generous.",

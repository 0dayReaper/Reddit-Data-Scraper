Bleach &amp; Naruto are literally 2 decades old at this point, so they aren't exactly comparing apples to apples. \n\nTake Demon Slayer, My hero, Dragon Ball super, Dr. Stone season 1, etc. NONE of them have fillers or cours. These days anime rarely adapts while the Manga is being published &amp; generally the Manga has a huge headstart. \n\nReleasing something in cours is just making more money for the studio houses, nothing else. \n\nBut hey, if you enjoy it, good for you; but it takes away from the immersion, for me at least. None of my friends who watch anime and work are fans of this system either. Nobody remembers the story too well after 6 months or so &amp; are rarely ever continue.",

Where as the anime adapted Toriyama's script and interpreted it differently. DBS being an exception since the anime actually aired before the manga was illustrated, my point still stands.\n\nPeople who watch anime aren't school kids anymore. There are people in their 20s trying to make a career and live a life. Remembering an anime story is the least of their worries. \n\nOfc, like you said, it's a business, and like every business, it has to earn money. But as anime has become so huge, they'll do that regardless. It seems to me, that this is a greedy way at the expense of the viewer's experience.\n\nEdit: Although modern anime has all but eliminated fillers, one popped into my mind; Spy X Family, one of the biggest shows of last year, was split into cours, and guess what? Most of second cour was filler. Clearly, it is a move designed to earn more money, rather than actually help eliminate fillers, like you suggested.",

I get that having to wait for it is annoying, but it's not bad in the slightest compared to waiting literal *years* for another season to come out. And it's not like it completely kills all the hype for the season.\n\nFor the record, AOT did not start the split-cour trend. I don't know for sure if these 2 shows absolutely did it *first* first, but *Seraph of the End* and *Gate* both did split-cours way before AOT did. I guess people like to point the finger at AOT just because it's more mainstream than them\u2026",

Generally a season will end at a reasonable point in the story, where as a cour is usually either on a major cliffhanger or it\u2019s abrupt. Both are bad &amp; they definitely do kill the hype, whether or not you\u2019re willing to admit it. \n\nYes, I\u2019m aware AOT was not the first to start the trend, food wars for example, did it before AOT. However, AOT did 100% popularize it. Why can\u2019t fanboys like you accept the flaws in a given show? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

I doubt it. \n\nYou're implying that studios animating such huge titles don't earn enough to pay their staff and are forced to release anime in cours? Do you have any source on that? AFAIK, the budget most mid to big studios work with are HUGE. Also, they earn a ton of revenue from merch sales, so I don't see why they'd have issues paying their workers.",

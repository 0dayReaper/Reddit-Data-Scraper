From blissfully doing radio announcements in her school, to  voicing anime for Funi, CR, and Sentai shows, Terri has been working for over a decade now. She's got a naturally low voice. But it's very unique, and def great for boy voices, older women, the rough n tough chicks, and mothers. She's also directed and script adapt for a few projects as well. Outside of voice acting, she also hosts a podcast called [Obscure Chatter,](https://www.obscurechatter.com/about/) which is run by both her and her husband Stephen Hoff. She also loves to have fun, loves sarcasm, and nachos.\n\nWhat are your favorite roles?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Minare Koda** (Wave, Listen to Me): Actually, the more I was looking up her biography to make this post, the more I realize how perfect of a hand-in-glove fit this role was for her, with her wanting to work in radio when she was younger, to voicing a podcast today. Easily my favorite she's voiced. Def the funniest and most fun I've had with a role she's played. Def an underrated show for sure, but she's amazing in it.\n\n\\- **Tsuki Uzaki** (Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out): \n\n\\- **Virgo** (Fairy Tail): Def the first show I heard her voice in, still my favorite of all of Lucy's spirits\n\n\\- **Mii** (Bofuri)\n\n\\- **Mikage Sakurai** (Asteroid In Love)",

She published a book that looks super interesting in 2017, and I really want to read it, but it's labeled as \"book 1\" and there isn't a sequel yet. The audiobook is narrated by an all-star cast of dub actors though!",

They edited a lot, from blood to cleavage to changing every Marine sail to Navy. \n\nThe license expired in 2006 or 2007, which was when 4Kids was already losing a ton of steam with their show output, so honestly I think they simply gave up. They did get to the beginning of Skypiea in that time, so that\u2019s not too shabby. I couldn\u2019t imagine them still wanting to adapt all that in 2023, unlike Yugioh (which they still adapt as 4K Entertainment) with little need to edit.",

This would lead to Funimation being given the licensing rights.",

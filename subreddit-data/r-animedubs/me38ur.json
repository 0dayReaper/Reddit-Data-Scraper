It's a cute slice of life with an op MC who gets up to hijinks with an ever expanding cast of cute girls (who are basically all monsters of one sort or another). If I had to compare it to something else, it'd be something along the lines of Last Dungeon Boonies or Kuma\u00b3 bear, but even more all in on cute and funny and putting the combat aside.",

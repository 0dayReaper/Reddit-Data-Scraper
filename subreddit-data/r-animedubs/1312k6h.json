I find Justin Briner is one of those VAs, along with Aaron Dismuke and Bryce Papenbrook, that sound the same in almost every role they have which is really distracting. I can\u2019t not hear Senku every time Marx talks in Black Clover or Shirogane talks in Kaguya Sama. Oh I just remembered Clifford Chaplin is another one that sounds the same a lot. The second Ryusui talked in Dr Stone I knew it was Bakugos VA.",

He's able to play all sorts of archetypes and likewise adjust his voice. If you can youtube \"Justin Briner best voice acting moment\u2019s\" you'll see what I mean. Could you still tell it's him? Well, yes. But he's using different tones, etc that isn't in Dekus. So yeah, he'll be fine here. He's played character types like Fuchi before.",

Those who can camouflage their voice for each role are insane (but even then you can still pick them up), but you shouldn't really expect every voice actor to do the same especially if you watch a lot of anime.",

There are HUNDREDS of anime being produced since then. Even the Japanese you would see the same people being casted on popular stuff if you watch sub enough. I find it a pointless complaint. Junichi Suwabe he was the star in Yuri in ice, as well the new anime right now My Home Hero, as well as last cour anime Blue Lock (and MHA). You could put Kenjiro Tsuda(jujutsu Kaisen, Chainsawman, etc), Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, etc in there so despite the Japanese have a larger pool you still see the same people. There are more anime being produced PER season than they are cartoons being created in the span of two years. They are probably   **300 anime**  being released each year. Sorry to say, recast are BOUND to happen. And what confuses me is that yes you see big names in big shows, but at the same time you see A LOT Of new names since the pandemic. It's insane how much people who didn't do much anime or brand new people there is. This is basically a non-issue at this point.",

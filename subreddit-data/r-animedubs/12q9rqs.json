Though, a lot of ecchi anime and manga do include nudity as well. A perfect example of an ecchi show that has very mild nudity would be Food Wars, since the whole series is basically a sex joke, but the actual nudity in the show is mild to non existent (i.e. covered up).\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecchi",

Both have great dubs (minus Spitfire in Air Gear. Really the only voice in that show that just boggles my mind)",

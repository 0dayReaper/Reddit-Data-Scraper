This has firmly improved its reputation, as black clover is now considered one of the best of the 2010s.\n\nTen years after the original Bleach ended, it came back with Thousand Year Blood War. The amount of hype for this was compared to Chainsaw Man. It didn't disappoint, becoming a highlight of 2022 and introducing Bleach to a new generation.",

I especially like the chemistry and bond between every member of the Black Bulls. I always thought of Black Clover as the upgraded version of Naruto- and that\u2019s largely due to the characters.",

The only ones I remember that jumped out at me were Patrick Seitz continuing on as Kenpachi (reaaaallly prefer the David Lodge performance), Ikkaku, and Ukitake.\n\nI know there were others, but I can't recall any that I noticed by watching (and not by reading about it beforehand). If anything, I just thought some of the returning cast just sounded a bit off.",

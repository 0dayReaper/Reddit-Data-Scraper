I think the roles that her voice is not well suited for are higher-pitched young voices. Her voice cracks significantly at higher pitches which separates her voice from the character and makes me think about her as an actor (sorta like how the Rock is the Rock in everything). I ran into this issue last night while I started to watch School-live. I rarely need to switch to the sub but her miscasting ruined the dub for me. TBF to her the sub-actress pitch is far higher than I think the character should have had from a manga reader's perspective).",

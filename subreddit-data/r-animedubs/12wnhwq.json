I hope she does like she did playing his 17 year old previous self, sounded more like a young boy, less like an adult woman except for the get away part, but if the plays him at age 10 like that, then I would not have a problem with it.  I\u2019m hoping that by season 2 if we get one there will be a time skip, bringing him to age 12, would be better to recast the voice of him to Someone who can make him sound older, it\u2019s not out of the ordinary, I remember one where in the same season there was 3 people playing the main characters role, one a man playing the main character before dying, then a woman playing the character at age 5, then after 2 episodes of that there is a time skip and he turns 12, there is a third person playing the voice.  Knowing the Japanese also sounded feminine and not masculine even for age 10, I\u2019ll probably be ok with it.  I think I would have a better feeling for it if it wasn\u2019t for her trying to play the guy who died, but I get it, I mean it was an extremely short scene and they probably did not want to hire a man to play the role for a total of what 10-15 seconds, lol.  But yeah if I did not hear her voice for that portion it would be better I think.  The baby talk, I don\u2019t really have a problem with, I know it\u2019s her attempting to match age.",

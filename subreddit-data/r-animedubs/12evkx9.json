Sentai/HIDIVE really knows this series is very hype and the manga is popular and it's gonna send emotional shockwaves. Can't wait for this hell of a ride in both sub and dub. Thank you Sentai.\n\nOn another note, I wasn't really expecting Farming Life in Another World to get a dub, but I'm happy it will be. And as expected, thank goodness Part 2 of Danmachi 4 is announced and it premieres in less than two weeks. I was also honestly expecting a Spy Classroom dub so I could at least enjoy it more but that's fine, the show was mid anyway. I hope we get dub announcements for their other spring titles.",

I've had hidive since it's beginning and as someone who only watched dub, hidive is extremely lacking.  Around 50+ dubs (probably way more actually) have been pulled since their merger.  Someone else said it best sentai licensed nearly as many titles as crunchy  over winter and 2 of them gets dubs? I'd love to see what kind of backlog dubs we could get with crunchyroll having access. Hidive is a shit show and never once tell subscribers when they purge content.",

I really like a bit of tension if they\u2019re going to try and make it an actual fantasy, so the SOL feels like a distinct show where they can go wild.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like how Full Metal Panics first season was weird because it was trying to be a goofy HS story and also a serious mecha show, but they were able to make Fumoffu which was totally off the wall hilarious, and then have the main show be much higher stakes.",

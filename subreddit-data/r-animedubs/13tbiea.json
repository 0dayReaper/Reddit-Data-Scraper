            "comment": "Honestly the worst thing about Oshi no Ko IMO is the dialogue. One thing that's interesting about dubs, especially when they use more literal translations like Sentai does, is that it's a lot easier to determine the quality of the dialogue when it's being spoken in your native tongue. I never thought OnK's dialogue was that great but hearing it in the dub made me realise that it's actually pretty bad altogether. And that's not necessarily a fault of the dub itself. I'm watching the sub and reading the manga and they're all like this, the dub just made it click more. It's an issue with the overly expository writing in the source material. While I sometimes think Crunchy dubs take too many liberties, I really wish Sentai took more.\n\nI prefer \"Wunderkind\" because it's more playful. I also like it because it's not a word a child would actually know unless they were, in fact, precocious, which makes it a multifaceted moniker that isn't quite as expository and blatant. \"Precocious baby\" is silly and too literal and it just sounds so awkward the more you hear it. OnK is supposed to be a realistic show, but one talks like this.\n\nTo end on a positive note: I really liked Mahany's delivery and acting. I think he did the best with what he had. He managed to sound natural and friendly without talking down to Aqua and without treating him like a real adult. He just sees him as an intelligent kid and it shows!",

I'm sure the next episodes won't be as bad because we won't be hearing them as often, but since they played an important role in the pilot, it really negatively impacted some of our experiences.!&lt;\n\nIt's a Sentai dub and it has the typical Sentai issues that will likely carry on moving forward, like an overly literal script and clunky dialogue, but from what I've read that was the main problem people had. I'm going into the next episodes with an open mind though.",

I had really high hopes for the dub and still have high hopes for it moving forward, but it feels tonally off when compared to the sub.  Some of the VAs are doing a great job like Natalie Rial and Ty Mahany, but overall either the director, script writer, or voice cast really blew it big time because of the strange tone.\n\nDonna Litton pales in comparison to fantastic work Rie Takahashi did in the role of Ai.  The entire first episode kind of hinges on your being able to buy into this character and that just didn't happen for me.   I have a hard time putting my finger on it but she just lacked the voice range or complexity that character needed to have.  It's honestly not fair to cast such a new VA for this pivotal role when they aren't ready for it.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing what the voice cast can bring as the story moves on with the \"teenage cast\".  I have high hopes for Jack Stansbury and Alyssa Marek.  They are going to need to bring their A game to draw me in!",

Winter 23 got four, but it seems like a lot of Spring 23 has been left on the table:\n\n- _Kubo Won\u2019t Let Me Be Invisible_\n\n- _The Dangers In My Heart_\n\n- _Insomniacs After School_\n\n- _Otaku Elf_\n\n- _Too Cute Crisis_\n\n- _Alice Gear_\n\n- _Tokyo Mew Mew New_\n\nAs it stands, _Urusei Yatsura_ and _DanMachi IV_ part 2 are still going, so along with _Oshi no Ko,_ that makes three current dubs. Can we expect any more?",

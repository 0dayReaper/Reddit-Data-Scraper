    "postText": " In Stone Ocean Episode 24, what I'm focusing on is when Pucci ~~excelerated~~ accelerated time on the woman at the grocery store, the woman's nails grew and the eggs she bought had baby chickens in them.\n\nThe eggs shouldn't have grown chickens because usually the chicken eggs sold at stores are unfertilized, so embryos shouldn't be able to develop inside them. \n\nI consider this a potential error because I don't know if the writers intended for fertilized eggs to be mistakenly sent to the store.",

I thought the same thing when I watched it, but most Stand abilities crumble to dust when you try and hold them to a standard of consistency so just take it at face value and enjoy the final bit to Stone Ocean.\n\nFor me it was the only bit that wasn't excruciatingly boring to sit through.",

I loved the final 3 or so episodes but otherwise not much in it for me.\n\nPart 5 very much grew on me after a time but I still think it's many steps below Part 4.",

I grew to fully appreciate Part 5 on my second watch, and pound for pound, I think it has the best battles in the anime (Part 7 rivals it manga-wise). With how incredible 4 and 5\u2019s ensemble casts were, it\u2019s boggling how Araki assembled the most shallow, forgettable crew imaginable for 6.\n\nIt was just a momentary lapse in judgement, as Steel Run Ball quickly proved.",

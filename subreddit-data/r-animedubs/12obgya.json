Sometimes I watch shows that are two cours in halves.  So I'll watch the first cour after it is done. Then wait to watch the second till it's done.",

I enjoy a show and retain it better when I watch it week to week. Binging it all at once can lead to it being more likely forgotten.\n\n\nI will sometimes still binge a show if its all out, but if Im watching it \"live\" Id rather week to week.",

I love you!\"\n\nAnd eitehr Ataru is dumb or is just so delusional for affection. Any love letter sent to him that's not from Lum is already a sign of a fake. Still, Ataru's ass better appreciate Lum a little more, being the only girl who falls for him. That 10K he got from Mendo, better treat Ms. Lum to somethinig REALY nice.",

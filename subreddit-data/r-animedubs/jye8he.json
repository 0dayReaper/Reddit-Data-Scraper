Which in both versions the girls take issue with. \n\nI get not liking the use of stuff like cuck, as it dates it. But the meaning of the scenes is the same in both versions. \n\nAlso Jamie didn\u2019t write any of Gal. \n\nAnd it\u2019s comments like this that bother me. As one she didn\u2019t by her repeated admission (when she\u2019s not trolling fans who freak out over this crap) inject any politics or try to do so with any lines. \n\nAnd two, it\u2019s hurt her career. Thanks to people whining about this her work was scrutinized by FUNi for any messages and she hasn\u2019t written a script in a while. \n\nDespite Jamie being responsible for hilarious and very sexually laden and innuendo heavy and fanservice-y dubs like Panty and Stocking, Yamada\u2019s 1st Time, Devil is a Part-Timer (which she cro wrote), etc. But no she wrote two fuckimg lines you misinterpreted and now she\u2019s awful and her great work is overlooked.  \n\nFuck everyone who gives her shit for that line. It hurt her career, it\u2019s unfounded and it cost anime dubs a hilarious writer. And she\u2019s scapegoated constantly.",

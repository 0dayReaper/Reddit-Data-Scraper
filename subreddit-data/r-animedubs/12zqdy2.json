Everything is just so slapshtick over the top insanity that I'm having a galaxy blast each viewing. This ep as well.\n\nNote to self: good looks will give you all the girls and all the food you could want. Side effects include beastly hangry mood swings. XD XD XD\n\nDef had a snort fest with Rei chasing Ataru and Lum around proposing(?) to everyone and smashing every food stall, as well as the shenanigans at school and with Ran. And I'm with  Mendo, I'd pick money over good-looks too.",

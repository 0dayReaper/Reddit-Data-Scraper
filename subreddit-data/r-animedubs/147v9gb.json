Usually when there's more than one they only distribute one per platform.\n\nFor home media, it can happen if the distributor buys the rights to both separate tracks for their DVDs/Blu-Rays (i.e. Akira, Evangelion).",

I've only watched the sentai but I hear mixed reviews as too which is better. So technically Netflix has both seasons dubbed in english although its not sentai' own dub.  I'm not sure if  cr would license and stream something like a sentai dub since it's like the only competitor.  Might be possible with something like netflix or Hulu though at some point. Although I'm fairly new to the game so maybe it's already happened and I didn't know",

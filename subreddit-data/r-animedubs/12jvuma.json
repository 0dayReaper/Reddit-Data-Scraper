Discotek has been snapping up the movies and including the Funimation dubs when they exist; but IMO, they\u2019d be the only ones that would snag the TV series rights if it was worth it to them. Since they\u2019re physical-first, it would have to be worth it to them to print them on SD Blu-Rays before them wanting it on Crunchyroll or Retro Crush.",

I wasn't necessarily embarrassed, I just knew it would become a whole annoying thing if people found out, because then they'd just change the topic to mock me for that and consider all my opinions on whatever anime in question we were talking about invalid.",

IMHO those that subscribe to Crunchyroll or other dedicated anime channels are more likely to watch sub as FOMO and staying current means watching close to release. The sometimes long delays for dubs do to production means a few anime fans would watch sub first, maybe dub later on. As for Netflix and other more mainstream variety channels, dub as they tend to do more whole season binge dumps or have money to pay for at release dubs.\n\nOf course this is all outside Japan cause they shit already dubbed on release.\n\nTLDR: unofficial speculation on my part means that depends on service.",

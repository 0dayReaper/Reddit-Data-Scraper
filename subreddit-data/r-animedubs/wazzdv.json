But anyone else? WHO KNOWS! \nIronically, the voice director is the person I'm most sure of. Assuming FuniRoll (that's Funimation + Crunchyroll) dubs it, I'd want Mike McFarland to direct it, assuming he isn't too caught up with Attack on Titan (his baby) or One Piece (which he shepards) to do it. If not him, then I'd want Brittany Lauda (who directed the lauded Akudama Drive dub, among others) or Emily Fajardo (who directed the, also lauded, My Dress-Up Darling dub, among others).\n\nIf Bang Zoom dubs it, I'd want Alex Von David (Kill la Kill and Konosuba) or Chris Cason (Mob Psycho 100 and Re:Zero) to direct it.",

She mostly handles more chill slice of life/romance shows from what I've looked up. At the most, she'll probably be an assistant of some sort.",

So many shows could benefit from remote recording, like they have in the past.

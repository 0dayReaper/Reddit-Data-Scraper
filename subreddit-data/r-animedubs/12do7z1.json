    "postText": "MASHLE will premiere on Friday April 7th, and there is no doubt that it is a popular Sh\u014dnen Manga, it will probably get a dub, but unfortunately, on CR it is only available in other languages such as French, German, Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese and Hindi dubs. I'm pretty sure it will get an English dub soon, and since Aniplex US got it, I think it's time for more L.A Talent to shine, in anticipation of the hyped anime, who would you cast in the English Dub of MASHLE ?",

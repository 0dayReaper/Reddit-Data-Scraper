It feels like there has been practically zero meaningful growth in their relationship since the start and while they have made a bunch of hints to the audience about Tsukasa being from some sort of mystical moon being, nothing real and Nasa hasn't picked up on anything.  I'd just like something to actually happen of consequence, good or bad.",

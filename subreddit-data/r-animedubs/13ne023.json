But deep in the forest exists a young man who spends his time training and bulking up. He can't use magic, but he enjoys a peaceful life with his father. His muscular body will have to protect him from the magic users who are out to get him.\n\n[Source](https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2023/05/20/mashle-magic-and-muscles-english-dub-flexes-main-cast-release-date)",

There are a lot of sequels being done, and it's a known fact that Funi/Crunchyroll have a lot of the new stuff. But this has always been the case. LA mostly dominate the anime video game space, but as you said if you do account sequels there's plenty of LA dubs.",

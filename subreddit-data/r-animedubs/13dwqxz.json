It was dark, it was cramped, I was scared. 0/5 - DO NOT recommend\n\n**Ataru**:  Delivery girl was a babe, too bad she's related to Mendo. Did I mention she was a babe? 5/5 stars\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLot of moments had me snorting out loud this ep. Back half in true Urusei Yatsura fashion with so much over the top board game craziness.",

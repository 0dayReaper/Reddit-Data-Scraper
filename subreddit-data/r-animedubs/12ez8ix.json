The filler is huge, the comedy is cringe and we get it, you broke the 4th wall.... its ep11 and I am still waiting for a single thing to happen.",

I was hoping to get some insight on what was going on by checking out this post but my guess is that not baby people are watching it either due to the lack of comments. Season 2 was just god awful. The comedy is extremely cringe and I agree, nothing really important happened.",

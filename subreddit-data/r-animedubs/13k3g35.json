Other than OnK those are probably my biggest credits - I voice in lot of other projects and shows too though which you can probably find by googling around with my name :)",

I am probably pressuring myself more than normal because of the quality of the source material and the adaptation's popularity. I of course always want to do a great job, but this does have a potentially once-in-a-lifetime role kind of feel to me.\n\nI'm current on both the manga the adaptation! Started on both after I was cast and am a huge fan even outside of my work on the production :)",

It had good ideas, but I would've preferred them if they were used as the end result of different shows rather than just\u2026\u2026 you know, cramming those ideas with multiple couples in one show. I just hate it when romance shows try to pull that kind of shit.\n\nIn fact, I guess you can say I thought this show was Horimid. \u2620\ufe0f",

It's exceedingly rare to see a story of actual couples doing couple things, so when that happens, and when it is treated normally without making it weird, that's already more appealing than like 80% of anime romances out there where the main pairing is normally too scared to hold hands, or god forbid they hug!\n\nMost anime romances are just... edging.  Horimiya is the payoff.\n\nIt's actually I think a factor in why SAO became so successful imo, because the couple was established early and you get to see them endure trials *as a couple* rather than just lonely, angsty teens for the umpteenth time.",

Horimiya deserves some points in that regard, but what really brought it down for me was the characters liking each other and thus causing some love triangle/polygon/\"however many characters there are(?)\" bullshit. It's just not the way I like to see drama done at all. Literally every character who goes to high school in this show aside from Shu ends up romantically interested in someone. Why should I care about characters like these when that's all they really exist to do at the end of the day? It's part of the reason why other series like Anohana, Golden Time, and Just Because all fell flat for me overall, why I dropped A Lull in the Sea halfway through, and why I became reluctant to watch Kokoro Connect after my brother told me the relationships between the characters were just as badly handled as ALITS.\n\nThe romance genre is something I feel like I've been really struggling to get into for a while, tbh. But after thinking about it for a while, I believe I've come to the conclusion that I prefer the kind of romance shows that either focus on 1 pairing alone (Dusk Maiden of Amnesia, Insomniacs After School), have love triangles that are done with more mature themes (Beastars, Bloom Into You), or when the typical high school love triangle/polygon subplots still pop up, but are quickly dealt with before the show moves on to something else (Iroduku, Shikimori).\n\nI think I really gotta hand it to Insomniacs After School for helping me reach this conclusion. It may still pointlessly tease us with the main pair almost kissing only to not go through with it, but hey, the show not having any meaningless love triangles (so far, anyway) is an automatic big W!",

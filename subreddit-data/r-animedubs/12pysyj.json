            "comment": "It has made me bear-y happy to put this on my monday viewings. I enjoy the comfort, personality, adventures, OP Beartagonist, and puns of this show Bear-y much. Looking forward to all the new adventures, muchies, and fun to be had with Ms. Yuna, Fina, and the rest of Crimonia. I'm pawsitive this is gonna be a very enjoyable season of shows.\n\n(Oh god, four bear puns in one post. What have I become? CURSE YOU KUMA!)\n\nSo glad to hear Marissa Lenti back as Best Bear. Easily one of my favorite roles of hers. And it's also great when CR can still do remote recordings for the VAs that are outside of TX like Marissa Lenti, Xanthe Huynh, Felecia Angelle, and Y. Chang.",

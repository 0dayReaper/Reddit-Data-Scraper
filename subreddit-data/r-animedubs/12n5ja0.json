It can be both Dub and sub so it\u2019s allowed this post. \n\nIf you could think that voice actors who are singers/musicians then post the comment here.",

He gave me about ten minutes of his time and we talked about his band when he didn't have to, but it was clear to me that the band was his priority over acting. I'm assuming they had a falling out?\n\n Thanked him for giving me a hell of a memory for my first con he seemed super appreciative.

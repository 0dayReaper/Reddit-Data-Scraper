Naturally, all who reside in this world can use magic. Magic is a normal part of everyday life. But deep within a certain forest lives a boy named Mash and his father-figure, Regro. Mash was frequently told to avoid going into town. The reason being, the mark that is ever present on everyone\u2019s face does not exist on Mash \u2014 for he cannot use magic.

Ahh Lemon, you were only created because Komoto\u2019s editor told him to.\n\nI still crack up at Mash just crushing his wand and being like \u201cHey Man, not cool.\u201d\n\nWhalberg sounds like Andrew Love, tho I could be wrong. If it is him, I\u2019m even more excited for stuff that comes later. Whalbergs a badass y\u2019all, just wait.\n\nThat spell looks just as terrifying as the manga.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d beat the stuffing out of you with my fist.\u201d\n\nOpti Ars sounds like something very different haha.\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHA They kept the \u201cGod is Dead\u201d part, Thank you Script writers!\n\nI like how Finn sounds, Kudos to Brian Anderson.",

It seems there is one where they they used audio from the ADV DVD and put in place of the Bang Zoom audio on the Bluray. The only one I could find is the  one someone posted earlier with a logo on top. Can't stand watching with the logo on top though lol. I can't see the comment because I'm on the mobile app and its only showing 4 atm",

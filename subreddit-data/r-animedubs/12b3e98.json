The Mc (Grelle) Spends 5-7 minutes explaining why it\u2019s historically accurate and acceptable for him to see girls naked.\n\nAll I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s a national treasure.\n\nFull title is Majikoi Oh! Samurai Girls \n\nWritten by Takahiro who wrote Akame Ga Kill which is hard to believe. Not the horny stuff, that\u2019s his bread and butter but the much more lighthearted tone.",

It's true that Josh Grelle, Brittney Karbowski, and Carli Mosier are up there. But the show also has Blake Shepard, Emily Neves, Tiffany Grant, Greg Ayers, David Matranga, Margaret McDonald, and Shelley Calene-Black, among a few others.\n\nSo if you find the time to watch it dub, you'll have a chance to like it.",

Essentially Yamato ( Grelle) is a student at Matial Arts High School that settle differences with giant military like battles involving the entire student body.\n\nIt does have a plot but it\u2019s more Ecchi slice of life stuff. Yamato has a harem and they all come onto him fairly aggressively (Each in their own way). To his Credit Yamato knows they are in love with him, he just doesn\u2019t return their feelings.",

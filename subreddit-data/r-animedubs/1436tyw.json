    "postText": "(Not sure if this is allowed, but I'm not sure where else this could be discussed)\n\nSentai handling the dub for [Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1324340/Made_in_Abyss_Binary_Star_Falling_into_Darkness/) was surprising enough given their traditional isolation from the rest of the J-media localization industry, but the true shock was NIS America hiring them for [Monark](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1539620/MONARK/) and [Labyrinth of Galleria: The Moon Society](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1998340/Labyrinth_of_Galleria_The_Moon_Society/). LoG's dub in particular has garnered quite a bit of praise.\n\nWhat're your thoughts on these dubs, and on Sentai potentially moving up in the localization world? I think it's great-- their talent is *finally* getting the chance to show their stuff, free from the usual constraints of anime dubbing. And with Crunchyroll going full heel, real competition in the TX pool is needed now more than ever",

                    "comment": "This is mostly a recent development. Crunchyroll commissions basically 90% of English anime dubs today, which obviously makes it tough for other players like Sentai. It's not quite a monopoly, it's just that people who can take on Crunchyroll (i.e. Sony Pictures) don't wanna waste money trying. Making your own things costs money, true, but you can have them to your personal standard and likely expect a decent return with the connexions you have. That only applies to the biggest studios (including newer ones like Netflix or Amazon) tho, so B-C list types like Sentai have to get money in other ways. \n\nSentai doesn't do much else besides translate and dub Japanese cartoons. They don't produce anything themselves, they're a licensor/ distributor, not enough money to blow on that like Hollywood. They can't get enough Japanese animation to pay the bills, the next best thing they can get to keep their audience and money is to go for dubbing Japanese videogames. Even ones they don't publish. I mean sure, having the in-house dub studio costs money too, but the money it makes from publishers outsourcing goes to you, not a contractor. Anime dubs sell better than anime subs too, so when they do get anime, it helps to have it on standby. \n\nBesides, it's exceedingly rare for a licensee-publisher (\u00e0 la Nintendo or Bandai) to use an in-house English voice producer, if they ever had one at all. Konami Cross Media is the only exception today i've seen, and the only one i've ever seen apply to Japanese cartoons. Granted, it's mostly just Yugioh, but still. Of the other licensees handling English voice production: the anime ones never published their work alone and the game ones mainly just used Japan-English actors or inconsistent handpicked ones.\n\nSentai's current scenario's happened before. In the dusk of ADV's time, they made dubs for other people like Upper Deck and Warner Bros. Hell, they handled the dubbing work for Unlimited SaGa. I don't know if anyone else did this, besides Working Designs dubbing but not publishing Dungeon Explorer 2. You gotta be in the sweet spot of \"making enough money to warrant an in house dub producer\" and \"not making enough made to just keep releasing what you were before\". \n\nWhat do i think of these dubs? I like them, and i like most of Sentai and ADV's work. Not as reliable as Funimation, but hey Funi doesn't dub games.\n\nSo if they or anyone else can undercut non-union LA, they will. Tho, outside of OkraTron dubbing games from Funi's shows, i haven't seen other Dallas game dubs as of late. Looks like there's a slight uptick of non-union NYC game dubs and non-union Vancouver dubs, tho.",

SAG-AFTRA does not go out searching for credits, especially not dub credits, or even video game actor credits on the whole. I get the feeling many are included by rote, not due to any deep fear or respect of SAG. It helps at the very least, but i've been burned before. \n\nThat said, zero percent chance any NISA/ Xseed dubs are unionized. This is one hundred percent cutting costs further. The Los Angeles producers still a bit cost more than any Texas studio even when they don't come with union dues. The Texas people have much lower costs of living and many have experience comparable to the current LA regulars. As a side note, i'm surprized none of the non-Crunchyroll Dallas studios have been called yet.",

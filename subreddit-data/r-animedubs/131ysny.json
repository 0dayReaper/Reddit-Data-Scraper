Old or new, as long as it's dubbed we'd like to hear about it. \n\nAnything good we should look out for? Anything bad we should try to avoid? Tell us a little bit of what you think. It's nice if you elaborate a bit on what it is you like or don't like about a show. That way your comment is useful to people who are looking for new anime to watch. :)\n\nWriting the names of the anime in **bold** is nice, to make it easier for people skimming the thread to pick out the names.\n\nSince this is also for people who are looking for new shows to watch, please use the spoilertag if you reveal any mayor plot points of the anime you are discussing (see spoilertag section in the sidebar for info on how).\n\n\nTo prevent low effort comments to steal the spotlight from people who put in a little bit more effort **top level comments in this thread must be at least 150 characters long** (roughly 3 sentences long).\n\n\n[You can find a list of the previous \"Your week in anime dubs\" posts here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/search/?q=author%3AAutoModerator+AND+title%3AYour+week+in+anime+dubs&amp;sort=new)",

IT goes deeper with the relationship of the gang, and the mystery keeps getting interesting and the plot twist. And the characters introduced are all interesting and the characters that didn't get much shine in Season 1 received it well here. I'm about to watch the Last episode and I'm excited to finish it off. \n\n**Heavenly Delusion:** Man, this anime is so interesting. It feels like a mix of Last of Us and The Promised Neverland but it still has an identity of its own. The world is so interesting. Yeah, definitely finishing this up this season!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hell's Paradise** is a show that's already worth watching. I know I will get enjoyment off this from the first two episodes. Interesting thus far.",

I was really on the fence on whether I wanted to check out season 2 at all; S1 left a pretty bad taste in my mouth as I couldn't stand Nagatoro's constant insults. However, several people said that the main characters and their relationship developed a lot in the sequel, so I decided to give it a chance.\n\nAnd it turns out those people were correct. I enjoyed the 2nd season a LOT more than the 1st. The big turning point was episode 4 (&gt;!the sick visit at Senpai's!&lt;) \u2013 after that, there were significantly more sweet moments than annoying ones between the two. Some scenes were genuinely touching. And the comedy was still pretty good.\n\nIn conclusion, season 2 easily saved this show for me. It's rare for a sequel to do that. One other example that did something similar for me is *Gunslinger Girl*, but that's all I can come up with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm rewatching ***The Quintessential Quintuplets*** again as the movie just dropped on Crunchyroll. As expected, I'm enjoying the ride, and I'm also very excited to finally see the ending to the story, no matter how rushed it allegedly is.",

But honestly, while many people say the harsh edge softens up after that episode, I still found the rest of season 1 pretty bad bullying-wise.\n\nBut after the turning point in season 2 that I mentioned, the sweet in their relationship starts to easily outshine the sour. Nagatoro's insults become less frequent, and they don't seem as mean-spirited anymore. Although that may be a matter of subjective perception.",

It may not impress you in the first episode, I am not sure if anything special happened in episode 1, because I binged this and I lost the track of what happens in each episode, I just see it as a whole series, but if you decide to watch it, give it a few episodes.\n\n\\- **Kase-san and Morning Glories** (60 minutes duration) - this is not a series, it is a GL that was recommended in a recent post and I can't tell you how good this is, even if you are not a fan of GL (I used to not like these) but when something is good, it just works. 2 Students start dating and it is just so sweet how they are both inexperienced but their moments are so sweet.\n\n\\- **Heroines run the show** \\- a girl moves to Tokyo and she needs money, she starts working as a manager-in-training for 2 idols from her class in high-school. She doesn't know anything about idols and she is not one of their fans but they will grow together. I refused to watch it for some time, but when I finally gave it a chance, it captivated my attention.\n\nAs you can see, I am not good at describing anime and their appeal, I just try to give as little details as possible to avoid ruining the fun for people who did not watch them yet.\n\nI really hope you give them a chance and I hope you enjoy them.\n\nHave a great week, you beautiful people!",

With the dub coming out a few weeks ago and so much on my plate right now I've decided to pick up the dub even though it sets me back a few episodes. I don't regret it. It's fantastic.\n\nMy only wish this year is that everyone from the original two seasons ~~gets recast~~ reprise their roles for the third season later this year. I can't imagine Aqua's English voice being anyone other than Faye Mata.",

To \"recast\" means you want everyone to be replaced lol. \"Reprise their roles\" would make more sense.\n\nAnyway, don't worry about Faye said a long time ago. She literally deleted those tweets almost immediately after posting them, likely because she realized it could get her into trouble or was frustrated at the time, or both. Therefore her old statements don't mean shit now.",

The Bears saying Bear Bear is so fuckinhg annoying I actively root for them to die. Cast is just too large and plot happens too fast. If it was much smaller and slower paced I would love it more like in S1.!&lt; 6/10\n\n**Nier Automata 1.1a** &gt;!I have no idea WTF is going on, and even reading up on the lore makes me even more confused. Looks pretty though. And the end puppets are fun.!&lt; No idea yet/10\n\n**Heavenly Delusion**:&gt;!This one is tough. It is an interesting world, well paced, and mature, but damn is it terrifying to sit through and I know it will be harder the deeper this goes. I have a feeling this will be one that I will need to be in the right state of mind to get through without pausing so often to get my bearings.!&lt; Too early to tell/10\n\n**Working for a god in a godless World**: &gt;!This is actually pretty interesting. I know the loli goddess will make others uneasy, but I think this is a good show, it explores religion very well, and a world without magic besides that is unique.!&lt; 7/10\n\n**Konosuba An Explosion!:** &gt;!Megumin in school, as someone who read the manga, I am loving this, do wonder how far it will go though, as it seems like they will end once she graduates. EXPLOSION!!&lt; 8/10\n\n**The Legendary Hero is Dead**: &gt;!Easily the best anime dub show this season, it is hilarious, the MC isn't super dumb, the premise is interesting, and it is ecchi. YES! Gib more. !&lt; 8/10",

It was stressful at the end there but the slight touch on romance was good even though I\u2019m not fond of romance, and I loved the supernatural elements.\n\n**K (project k)** I really really enjoyed this first season. You end up being really confused at first, like what is going on and everything is basically frustratingly unexplained, but then it all comes together and is so awesome!! It\u2019s basically about a guy that has a video sent out that he murdered someone but doesn\u2019t remember doing it at all. There are also \u201cgangs\u201d (not like organized crime though), in this anime as well. Gunna start the movie tonight",

A straightforward story of youth &amp; hope, with some rather surprising twists (&gt;!such as Aya's yuri love confession!&lt;).  \n2. **The Devil is a Part-Timer!** - IGN's \"Best Anime of the Decade\" article set me to watch this reverse isekai, and after 7 episodes I am enjoying every moment of it. Can't wait to follow it up with S2.",

Michael Tatum just barely taking the victory with by two votes. (If just one of J. Michael Tatum's votes had swung the other way, causing a tie, then Johnny Yong Bosch would have won due to him higher seeding.)\n\nTo celebrate his victory, comment some of your favourite roles from J.

The next one will likely be in January, just to give it a bit of a break after these two that were held in back-to-back months. Let me know if you have any ideas for future dub-themed brackets and I'll take them into consideration!\n\n&amp;nbsp;",

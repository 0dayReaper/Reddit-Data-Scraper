Sentai Filmworks did not dub the other seasons. And yes, it was directed by John Swasey who also directed the Revue Starlight, Kakeguri DVD, and possibly Vinland Saga DVD dubs.

There are some early dubs (like pre-2000) that I would put in the former that maybe have a few elements that likely wouldn't really fly today, but can be appreciated for their time. While on the other hand, there are modern dubs that on paper shouldn't be that bad, but you watch them and you can tell they just don't work.\n\nFor post-2010 dubs that I think are pretty bad, the first one that comes to mind that hasn't been mentioned yet would be **Mawaru Penguindrum**. There are a handful of modern Sentai dubs I could include instead, but this show's dub in particular really dropped the ball.\n\n*Very* early Funi-simuldubs could be hit or miss too considering it was a very new process for the studio. timetable learning adjustment, directors were more likely to play things extremely safe with casting given the demanding schedule, etc... but the worst of that bunch didn't really fall below simply mediocre imo.",

            "comment": "**Summertime Render** was about as close to straight up bad as I can think of. There appeared to be some very basic technical issues with the sound engineering. It was also one of the first shows I've seen in ages where the lip-flap issue was actually noticeable. The show's saving grace was that the 3 characters who dominated the big scenes, were all voiced by the more veteran VAs among the cast, and they really nailed it. Most of the rest of the cast were between okay and good imo. However, the performance for Mio definitely struggled during emotional scenes, and while the VA for Hizuru nailed that role, I thought they did not sound good as Ry\u016bnosuke.\n\nNot terrible, but I thought the dub for **My Girlfriend is Shobitch** was definitely not good. The performances were fine, but there was like 0 localization. How do you decide to dub a comedy that's heavily centered on double-entendres, puns, and wordplay, and not localize the hell out of it?\n\nI thought the Netflix redub of **NGE** was pretty bad too. Apart from the script being full of awkward/unnatural sounding dialogue, I also thought that Shiniji's performance was really off-putting during more emotional scenes (definitely nailed a lot of the angsty scenes though, which is like 75% of the character I guess). Otherwise I thought the rest of the performances were pretty good actually.\n\nI also really didn't like the dub for S1 of **Tonikawa**, between the catch-phrase thing, and the rather pitchy performances of the 2 MCs, I just really can't enjoy it. Considering I'm enjoying the dub in S2 much better, I think it must have been a bit of a directional issue in S1.",

Even if the MC is supposed to be emotionless 95% of the time, he shouldn't sound completely monotonous, or as if his voice was wasted after smoking for way too long. A lot of the other performances just felt stilted. Even the veterans such as Brittney Karbowski and Luci Christian sounded fairly strained, which only goes to show how incompetent of a voice director John Swasey is. There were also some comedic moments that felt poorly delivered. I feel like Adam Gibbs was really the only one who nailed his comedic moments since that's all his character was: a complete joke, who honestly would've made the show 10 times better if he was the MC instead. And yes, the show itself is just fucking terrible in general too lmfao. Nothing really felt earned.",

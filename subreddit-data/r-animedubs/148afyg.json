    "postText": "Looking for some suggestions. She\u2019s watched Sailor Moon and all Ghibli movies. Watched Kaleido Star, Restaurant to another world, Cardcaptor Sakura, Pokemon, Digimon, and Yu-gi-oh. I also have on her list Mob Psycho, Nadia: the secret of blue water, and Petite princess yucie. I had thought Magi would be a good one but apparently it\u2019s mature (according to Netflix), TV-14 on Crunchy. What do you guys think? I feel like most anime is rated TV-13 but I know I still watched it anyway. (Just want to keep away from most sexual references, although Naruto level is fine). Thank you all for your time and recommendations.\n\nEdit: she\u2019s also watched Welcome to demon school, iruma-kun",

There is violence but no blood/gore and no sexual references. It\u2019s about a young girl who plays a fantasy RPG and gets OP. \n\nCells at Work is educational and cute. It\u2019s about cells in a human body doing cell stuff. I would avoid the spin-off \u201cCode Black\u201d since it deals with more adult topics like venereal diseases and whatnot. \n\nHinamatsuri is one of my favorites. It\u2019s about a young girl with superpowers who gets adopted by a Yakuza thug. Some of the humor may go over her head, though.\n\nWelcome to Demon School, Iruma-kun! is designed for younger kids. It\u2019s about a boy who goes to a school for demons despite being a human. Hijinks ensue.",

I'm fascinated with Sagiri's hesitation to killing, even though she's seems a natural at it. I'm looking forward to seeing how her time with Gabimaru will unshake that burden of fear she carries. \n\nDef my favorite show to look forward to on weekends thus far.",

He also ripped out the guys throat and jugular with his bare teeth. Still I wonder what horrors await on the island? As we saw with the flower guy. He look stunned by the island, but I doubt it is paradise.",

Aura from Overlord is a little too cheery.\n\nThe cast of convicts seems eclectic.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how Sagiri's character evolves. She was working under the assumption that she needs to let go of her fear and apprehension of killing, when in reality that's something that should never go away. If it does, you're probably only a few steps away from a psychopath.\n\nThere's literally nothing in common with the two (other than the voice actress), but I can't stop imagining a grown up Hori for some reason.",

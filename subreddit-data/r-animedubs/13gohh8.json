EP 4 is out now just as EP 7 released in sub, which is only a 3 or so weeks behind, I think that's not bad for one of our first simul/fast-follow releases! \n\n(Dw tho, it is being worked on for the future)",

In a jar someplace?\n\nThe episode with the kids at the institute is even weirder. So it's clear they all have super powers. The frog looking girl is spiderman, and Tokio has some kind of ability to cloak herself from electronics. \n\nEven more mysterious, the artist kid was drawing the exact same hand-fish monster that attacked Maru and Kiruko. I'm assuming he's some kind of reality warper or monster maker like Rita Repulsa.\n\nBut the biggest bombshell were the \"babies\" Now I'm really wondering if those kids are actually human, and since Tokio looks eerily like Maru, what that makes Maru. Speaking of Tokio, I think her and artsy boy are leading up to a Darling In The Franxx moment.\n\nSpeaking of the fish\n\n\u266b I was gonna eat some kids, but then I got hiiiiiigh \u266b\n\n\u266b I woulda chomped, and I woulda splashed, but then I got hiiiiiigh \u266b\n\n\u266b Now I'm all dried out, and I know whyyyyyyy \u266b\n\n\u266b Cuz I got high, because I got high, because I got hiiiiiigh \u266b",

From what I see, it apparently falls into a grey area in copyright, and it does have historical value.",

But Disney\u2019s is no slouch.  I thought Elle edged out Cheryl\u2019s still great Mei, and while Dakota is a bit more toned down at the latter moments of the movie she still is effective.  I can go either way with this one.\n\nThat\u2019s at least more than I can say for the older non-Disney dubs of Nausicaa, Laputa, and Porco Rosso.  For those three the Disney dubs have the upper hand here IMO.",

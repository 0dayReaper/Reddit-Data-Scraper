            "comment": "First episode is out on Saturday:\n\n&gt;Ever since their father died, Ichirou Kuga has struggled to support his two younger siblings on nothing but a small inheritance and his passion for drawing manga. But it\u2019s becoming harder to keep up with his growing responsibilities and deadlines, especially after his last two assistants quit to follow their dreams.  \n\n\n&gt;Just as he\u2019s nearing his breaking point, the beautiful and scarily competent Shiori Goshiki applies to become his new assistant. But there\u2019s something almost otherworldly about Goshiki, and soon Kuga finds his reality turned upside down when she suddenly declares them engaged to marry!\n\nCast:\n\n* Shiori voiced by Katelyn Barr\n\n* Ichiro voiced by Nazeeh Tarsha\n\n* Chihiro voiced by Meg McClain\n\n* Machi voiced by Kelsey Maher\n\n* Fumio voiced by Emily Fajardo \n\n* Morikuni voiced by Jack Reeder \n\n* Miyako voiced by Natalie Van Sistine \n\n* Takeru voiced by Bruce DuBose\n\n* Aya voiced by Laurie Steele\n \n\nCrew\n\n* ADR Director: Jonathan Rigg\n\n* ADR Engineer: Jeremy Woods\n\n* Mixer: Gino Palencia\n\n* ADR Scripts: Hayden Daviau, Katelyn Barr",

Correct me if i'm wrong, but I do think this is Katelyn Barr's 2nd ever main lead. She must really enjoy this for her to be doing both scripts and Shiori. Looking forward to it. And I like how Nazeeh Tarsha keeps establishing himself as a very solid regular every season.\n\nI think this is gonna be a fun one. Been watching the sub and enjoyed it. Will switch to the dub this weekend.",

Then the next four (5-8) this past weekend.\n\nNow they're only 1 episode behind the CR dub, and 3 behind the Japanese release.\n\nRemains to be seen whether they stick to batches of 4, which means the next batch won't likely be for a few weeks since they've practically caught up to Japan/simuldub territory or switch to a weekly dub like CR. Both are already unusual for Netflix who typically only does full cour/season drops.",

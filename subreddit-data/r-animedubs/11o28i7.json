If she's another one of the girls who supposedly \"recognized his scent\" and is now in love with him from his high school, I'm going to be soooooo confused. Everyone at his high school ripped on him for his terrible BO. \n\nThe other classmate who was seemingly crushing on him when she found him at the magic academy was just baffling. They went from disgusted by the smell to enjoying it since he's supposedly hot now I guess?",

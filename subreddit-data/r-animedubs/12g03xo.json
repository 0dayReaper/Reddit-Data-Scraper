Has Seika thought about the fact that once he and Yifa go off adventuring together, that he won't be able to protect the hero? If he's determined to changed his thought process and try to act more normal and embrace his new life, will he accept Yifa's feelings? Will all this be addressed in the last episode?",

My guess is he IS the demon king but doesn't actually know it himself.",

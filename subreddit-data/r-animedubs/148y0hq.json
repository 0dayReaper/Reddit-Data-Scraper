That line would have sounded bizarre and shoehorned in if it were done in something like Demon Slayer, but Sk8 was the perfect show for this and David Wald's delivery was so hammy, he nailed the line. I hear it was also improvised?\n\nI remember that the r/kotakuinaction AFCs were crying and malding over this line and I'm just like, dude, have you watched the show? Or are you just complaining because you like getting triggered over things?\n\nFWIW I think it's totally fair to want faithful adaptations, but saying this was part of ThE aGeNda was just stupid.\n\nAlso, I had no idea that line in Naruto was so different. That's such a marked improvement over the source material.",

            "comment": "The Funimation dub of Dragon Ball Z has some of the worst line changes in anime history. Goku going from sparing Vegeta on Earth because he wants to fight him again to sparing him because it's the right thing to do. Vegeta telling Goku how the Saiyans' pride were broken working for Freeza morphing into Vegeta telling Goku to not let Freeza do to others what he did to him. Goku declaring that he's the Super Saiyan, Son Goku, to Goku giving a huge speech about how he's the ally to good. Gohan silently taking in Android 16's demise becoming an inner monologue about how nice 16 was and how it's time for him to get angry. These are not minor line changes. These are re-characterizing moments. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFortunately, Kai came along and adapted these moments a lot better, keeping even throwaway lines at times, like Freeza comparing fighting him to ants fighting a dinosaur.",

A-are you crazy? \n\nGoku: P-please.... T-this is the only thing I'll ever ask for myself...\n\nKuririn: But Goku, this is the guy that killed our friends, and tied to kill everyone else in the world! If we let him go now, he's certain to recover his strength and come back here!\n\nGoku: Y-you're probably right. \n\nKuririn: If you're thinking that maybe he'll have a change of heart the way Piccolo did then you're greatly mistaken! He's not that kind of guy!\n\nGoku: I know that... and I know that Vegeta there has incredible strength. S-stil... I ain't able to say this too well, but when I saw him nearly dead there, I thought to myself: \"What a waste.\" \n\nKuririn: What a waste?\n\nGoku: After training at Kaio-sama's place, I thought I had reachced my pinnacle... but that Vegeta guy there has done far better than I have. It surprised me. To be honest, I was overwhelmed. But somewhere within my heart, I was happy and excited. That must be because I'm a Saiyan, too. Whenever I see an amazing guy like that, my heart leaps. I want to train even more and fight him again. \n\nKuririn: This is the guy who killed Yamucha-san, Tenshinhan, and Chaozu! \n\nGoku: I know it's not the right thing to do... but please... grant me myself request... Let me have... another chance to fight him! \n\nKuririn (after hesitating, dropping the sword): All right. You've got the right to ask for something for yourself. It's thanks to you that we even have the earth at all now, Goku. But remember, Goku... next time you take him down with devestating power! \n\nGoku: Yeah, I sure will. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nENGLISH\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKrillin: Goku? Is that you? We've... we've got to stop this guy while we have the chance! He... he's pure evil.\n\nGoku: No, listen, just let him go, Krillin. Show him what it means to be merciful. \n\nKrillin: Merciful?! But, Goku, he---\n\nGoku: I know what you must be thinking, Krillin. But believe me, I know what I'm doing. When Piccolo came to us, he was just as evil as his father had been. He nearly destroyed not only me, but the entire planet. And now...\n\nKrillin: And now he's one of us. \n\nGoku: Right. And if somebody as evil as Piccolo can change, I think anyone can. Vegeta deserves to have that same chance! By showing him that the people of this planet have compassion and show mercy, maybe he can learn to show some of his own. Piccolo learned, and now he's not only a powerful ally, he's also a good friend. He even took care of Gohan while I was gone and traded his own life to protect him. Who knows? Vegeta might do the same thing for one of us someday. Krillin, please! I know this is the right thing to do. You've got to trust me.\n\nKrillin: But the Saiyans killed Yamcha! And Tien! And Chiaotzu! I can't let him get away!\n\nGoku: Don't do it, Krillin! I know it seems like justice, but it's not right. If you strike him down, you'll only show we're no better than he is! It means they've won, no matter what! Be strong! Don't forget, Krillin. I'm a Saiyan, just like he is. \n\n\\*Krillin hesitates, but drops the sword\\*\n\nGoku: Thanks, Krillin. That took a lot of strength and courage. I'm proud of you. \n\nKrillin: Goku, I sure hope you're right about all this. I hate to think of what might happen if he comes back to try this again. But if he does, we'll be ready for him. And stop him again!\n\nGoku: You bet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEntirely different conversations! What were they thinking? The reasoning behind Vegeta being spared is exactly the opposite!",

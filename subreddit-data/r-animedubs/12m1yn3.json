Old or new, as long as it's dubbed we'd like to hear about it. \n\nAnything good we should look out for? Anything bad we should try to avoid? Tell us a little bit of what you think. It's nice if you elaborate a bit on what it is you like or don't like about a show. That way your comment is useful to people who are looking for new anime to watch. :)\n\nWriting the names of the anime in **bold** is nice, to make it easier for people skimming the thread to pick out the names.\n\nSince this is also for people who are looking for new shows to watch, please use the spoilertag if you reveal any mayor plot points of the anime you are discussing (see spoilertag section in the sidebar for info on how).\n\n\nTo prevent low effort comments to steal the spotlight from people who put in a little bit more effort **top level comments in this thread must be at least 150 characters long** (roughly 3 sentences long).\n\n\n[You can find a list of the previous \"Your week in anime dubs\" posts here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/search/?q=author%3AAutoModerator+AND+title%3AYour+week+in+anime+dubs&amp;sort=new)",

            "comment": "I watched a classic, **The Girl Who Leapt Through Time**. The movie is about a girl who suddenly obtains the ability to time leap, and she uses it to live out her best days in school by reliving fun moments and fixing any social blunders. It's *Steins;Gate* but as a high school slice of life! The time traveling scenes have trippy, out-of-this-world sequences and are hyped up by slick running animation. The music is a blast. The tracks vary from classical to quirky techno and fill out the scenes nicely. The first hour of the movie is a fantastic ride that cleverly weaves in the moral hazards of time travel, (main character) Makoto's own social development, and fun time-travel shenanigans. The falling action in the last stretch is a bit anti-climactic and does spoil the magic of it all by explaining everything, but the movie ends on a satisfying, if not bittersweet, note. I love my time-travel anime, and I'm a sucker for romance, so I am glad to have seen this classic. My final thoughts: \u201cWhoa\u2026 that was cool.\u201d",

            "comment": "3/4 done with my 2nd viewing of **Shirobako.** And also just reached the halfway point of my first time viewing of **Tokyo Ravens**.\n\nOver the past week and a half, I binged finished the Netflix 1st half of **Vinland Saga S2**. (I've actually seen the S1 netflix dub as well.). Easily with S1, Kirk Thornton as Askeladd was my favorite performance of the show. But so far with S2, it's easily Aleks Le. (Also want to give credit to Ian Sinclair with the CR dub before I made the jump). I really do think Aleks Le is outdoing himself with Thorfinn. Really enjoying this watch.\n\nAlso finished **Uncle from Another World**. I thought it was fun. Though to be fair, I loved seeing the reactions of Takafumi and Fujimiya to Uncle's adventures and misunderstandings more than the actual adventures that Uncle went through. Still it was a fun watch. Feodore Chin, Aleks Le, and Jenny Yokobori were my faves.\n\nLastly, it's been on my watchlist for a while. But I've started watching **Recovery of an MMO Junkie**. I'm about 4 episodes in. I think it's decent. Moriko is def my favorite character in the show so far. This show does speak a bit to me. And it's got a good vibe that I'm liking so far.",

                            "comment": "This is my personal opinion, but Shirobako is one of Sentai's best dubs. It's one of those SoL shows that I truly feel that every anime viewer who loves the SoL genre should watch at least once in their life (sub or dub). \n\nYeah, the main five don't meet up with each other as frequently in the show. I think it's to reflect how adulthood responsibilities can take time away from spending it with friends. I know they all have a friend meet up in episode four. But from then on, maybe a few of them would meet up with each other in a few episodes sprinkled through out.\n\nMaybe just a little spoiler, but there's a lot more of the main five in the second half of the show. &gt;!Slowly, the group start to work on the same show. But since they're all working in different departments, there isn't really much interaction between them other than coordinating with each other.!&lt;\n\nI really hope that you give Shirobako another chance. There's a lot of relatable elements. Plus, it gives you a perspective of how anime is made in anime form. And te cast and crew at Sentai did a fantastic job dubbing it imo.",

They have a tinge of valley girl mixed with surfer bro speech at times, and the delivery of some of the lines have that, some region of the US, accent where they speak like they're asking a question but they're not; that tonal rise at end of a sentence or whatever.",

            "comment": "This is what I watched during the last two weeks, since I didn't post here last week. \n\n**Legend of Korra season 2** - My feelings toward this season varied wildly during the high and low points. There were two main arcs running parallel, one of which I really enjoyed and another that I disliked. [Korra] &gt;!I thought the civil war plotline was great. I loved the added background to Korra's family and the Water Tribes, and seeing Korra go to extremes to protect them. The development for Tenzin and his family was great as well. On the other hand, I didn't care for the spirit world plot. I'm not a fan of supernatural elements to begin with, and these segments often featured the characters making one bad decision after another, ultimately ending with what felt like the worst decision of all by Korra - leaving the portals open despite having seen for herself what the world used to be like for humans before they were closed by her past life.!&lt; \n\nThe art was beautiful throughout, with so many fascinating and adorable new creature designs, and the action scenes were great as always. Some of the new characters, like Varric and Zhu Li, were fantastic while others felt more like caricatures until they finally got some development late in the game. Unfortunately, the main cast often made poor, out-of-character choices in order to force the plot to go a certain way. This was a really difficult season to rate because of the conflicting highs and lows, but the more interesting half of the plot and Varric's comedic antics really carried the show for me, so I still enjoyed it overall. **Rating: 8/10**, still a pretty good show but a big drop from season 1.\n\nI also started **Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens** but decided to drop it after not enjoying the early episodes enough to continue. It has an interesting concept, and there were a few fun parts with the detectives' investigation and hitmen just being bros, but this show delved a little too deeply into showing the darkest side of the criminal underworld like human trafficking, torture and sexual assault. At that point, the show just became too bleak and graphic for me to enjoy it. \n\nI just finished watching **Sword Art Online: War of Underworld** again (for the second time within a month) as well, so I'll need to choose a few new shows from my list to watch next week.",

            "comment": "I watch the dubs of pretty much anything that I watched subtitled a week earlier, but I gotta say something about the dub of _Kanojo ga Koushaku-tei ni Itta Riyuu._\n\nI've now seen two dubs where an important role was given to a certain voice actress, and in both cases, they ruined the whole thing for me.  This really stung in the case of _Mushoku Tensei,_ because it's such an important anime and the character was one of the most important in it.  But now they gave her the protagonist's role in this?\n\nLook.  I think we all understand that even in modern dubs, which absolutely set the standard, you occasionally get bit parts where the voice is either terribly wrong (like a high school girl who sounds 40 and doesn't seem to care) or has zero acting chops.  I consider these anomalies to be the inevitable fallout of a dubbing industry that used to be 99% bad, and still needs to shake loose some of the elements that fundamentally led to that phenomenon.  But as far as I can tell, _this_ voice actress is relatively new, and here to stay.\n\nWhy?  Am I going to have to be on guard for this?  Will future anime dubs that I care about be under the threat of studios haphazardly hiring this VA to cover important roles?  How do they not recognize how bad she is at this?",

Where's my season 2 ;(?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, I got through all of ***86***. Not typically my kind of show, but I gave this one a chance because what little I knew about it before going in gave me hopes that it might turn into another personal surprise hit \u00e0 la *Darling in the FranXX*.\n\nThe first half was quite promising, all things considered. I liked the story jumping back and forth between Lena and the 86. Especially how Lena didn't give up on her convictions and slowly managed to close the distance between her and them. And when I saw what Lena had become after the cour split (first half of episode 12), I was almost ecstatic \u2013 it was awesome and made me hyped to see what she'd do next.\n\nExcept that she ended up doing pretty much nothing because the writer decided to almost cut her from the story entirely. With her being my favorite character by a big margin, this really tanked my enjoyment of the show. Her making a reappearance in the final stretch was nice and all, and the ending had some very welcome emotional beats. But overall, the anime ended up feeling pretty lackluster to me as a result.",

I was wondering if it was worth looking into since I'm not the biggest fan of watching action shows that are sub. Also, if anyone know how to watch it I'll take that info too since I've heard there is a particular watch order but I have no clue how to watch it.",

            "comment": "There's no exactly right answer. Basically there's two possibilities: \n\n1) watch Unlimited Bladeworks (the UFOtable TV anime, NOT the movie) first, then Heavens Feel, then Zero. This, effectively, \"spoils\" Fate/Zero. However, Fate/Zero was a prequel, released after the original Fate/stay night. So it was kind of meant to be \"spoiled\". \n\n2) Watching Zero, then Unlimited Blade Works, then Heavens Feel. This is more of a proper chronological order (kind of...) and is also the anime release order. It's honestly how most people watched it. It's perfectly sensible to watch it that way - the problem though is that Zero spoils Heavens Feel.\n\nSo basically, you just have to choose between whether you'd rather be spoiled about Heaven's Feel or about Zero, each spoils the other (and you *have* to watch UBW before Heavens Feel, as Heavens Feel lacks any introduction to characters and concepts at all, it just throws you in). It's a wacky situation but hey, that's the Fate series for you. \n\nOh, and you only need to watch the Ufotable anime. The original Fate/stay night and the original UBW movie, both by Studio Deen, are pretty bad and it's commonly suggested that you skip them. Technically the original Fate/stay night covers the first of the three original stories and it hasn't been re-adapted since, so if you're reaaaaally dedicated, you can watch it before UBW.",

Yes Kirei having Gil I guess can be one but kirei and Gil are lacking in ubw without watching zero first as they are just kinda bland without the development from zero. The main spoiler I would say is the siblings but even then it\u2019s a kinda small point in the rest of the story and doesn\u2019t ruin much. Again the beef with zouken works better having seen zero first as it sets up these characters and stories. \n\nI think ubw starts off better to new people but quickly makes stuff worse and more confusing if you haven\u2019t seen zero. Where as zero starts off more confusing to people watching but as you continue the more everything makes sense even when going into ubw and heavens feel. \n\nI think both watch orders are fine and in a sense correct but I would also Recommend trying to start with zero but if it is way to Hard to follow the switch and start with ubw.",

Zero was canonically released after the rest was complete, so it\u2019s ideal to watch it last. I started with the original and zero first and if i could redo it again I definitely would start with ubw",

I understand both sides but zero is much better without being spoiled, and it helps you understand so many more characters, their motivations and certain thematic points in the story of ubw and heavens feel.",

And I honestly felt zero very confusing the first time and didn\u2019t understand the grail war fully until ubw, so to each their own I guess",

But opposite of you I didn\u2019t really understand the grail war and servants fully until zero. \n\nI will always say this each watch order has strengths and weaknesses and I will recommend if you have the time and want to watch it in one order then rewatch it at some point in the other order.",

Also again It was released that way originally so HF comes before fate zero via release order. Lastly, I know this doesn\u2019t get talked about too much, but fate zero was written by a different person than Type-Moon, (he also wrote Madoka Magicka and psycho-pass!)type-moon IS the dude who wrote all of fate/stay night, and he\u2019s even said before that fate zero isn\u2019t really exactly canon. And I watched fate zero before the rest cause I didn\u2019t look up proper order before. Not the end of the world tho I still love fate more than any other anime :)",

UBW, Heaven's Feel, Zero is sort of chronological release order if that makes sense because the original visual novel, that had Fate/Stay Night, Unlimited Blade Works, and Heaven's Feel routes included in there was released before the Fate Zero novel and anime was released.  Both have pros and cons, but you'll likely enjoy it whatever order you choose.",

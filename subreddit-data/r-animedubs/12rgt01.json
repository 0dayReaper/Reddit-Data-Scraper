            "comment": "So here are a few uncommon recommendations (all dubbed): \n\nFuuka - amazing romance mixed with music. \n\nSing Yesterday For Me - this one focuses on dealing with romantic feelings and difficult emotions. \n\nShuffle - this one is a bit of a ride, so be prepared. \n\nAsterisk War - action with romance (actual romance, not the sprinkled stuff) \n\nChivalry of a Failed Knight - one of my personal favorites. \n\nWorldEnd - great one as well, but you have to pay attention to the story\n\nEf A Tale of Melodies - really dramatic but great romance. \n\nI could go on, but these are a great start, and not many talk about them!",

There's three seasons, all on different providers so you'll likely have access to at least one season. There's no real order to it so you can watch any season as they are all really just individual stories.",

No real rivals to speak of. Just two people with fun chemistry falling in love. Hell, they even steer clear of the long standing misunderstanding where like 2 episodes are wasted on something that could have been solved if they just talked for 2 seconds. She copes with being nervous/embarassed by teasing him so he's the one flustered instead.\n\nFirst episode is a little bit rough on the bullying tho, but it's very wholesome and heartwarming af after that",

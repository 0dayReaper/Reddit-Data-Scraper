Not to say all dubs were bad, but the majority fit the things people whine about today. There were definitely a couple of key dubs that really allowed people to have the timeless dub vs sub argument at all (Yu Yu Hakusho, cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, and so on), but let's face facts. Anime was wildly niche until toonami brought it to a generation of kids who would go on to bring it more mainstream. (If you think anime isn't at least somewhat mainstream now, then you're super young)\n\nBecause it was so niche, studios doing the dubs definitely didn't get much funding and unless you snagged some of the limited pool of decent VAs, you were working either amateurs or sometimes even whoever you could find in the studio to get the work done. It wasn't until studios saw a proper market for western audiences that we started to see the beginning of this golden age of dubs we've been living in for the passed 15 years or so.\n\nCase in point, most of the Ghibli dubs were amazing and still hold up today because Disney owned the distribution rights and cast A listers to do the roles. Billy Crystal, Kristen Dunst, Liam Neeson, they really put some great effort (with heavy influence from Miyazaki) and other anime didn't get this treatment until later.",

I didn't get into anime until Attack on Titan came out and even then, I really didn't start watching anime voraciously until a few years ago, so my baseline are the recent dubs, like MHA, which I see no problem with. I'm constantly seeing the same blanket statement of \"dubs are bad\" without any strong evidence to back it up. It's funny that you bring up Cowboy Bebop because that and FMA:B are always the two main examples brought up when someone says \"dubs are mostly bad except these two.\" I see that and I'm thinking \"there are 100+ dubs out there. There's no way the majority of them are that terrible that you can make such a generalization.\"",

Modern anime dub is definitely in the majority good quality. But there's not much you can do to convince someone otherwise, it goes beyond logic and at best its just their own personal taste.",

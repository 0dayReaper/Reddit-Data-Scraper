It looked like Mitsuha's 9mm rounds were bounding off, while the captain's (I assume) 5.56 rifle was punching through their skulls. While real world isn't this dramatic, a rifle round will hit much harder than a pistol. Then the captain ruined my observations by pulling out his Glock(?) and successfully shooting a goblin in the head.\n\nAlso, amused that Mitsuha and the captain were having a nice conversation in the cave. You fire a short barreled AR in an enclosed space with no ear protection, the only thing you'll be hearing is FWEEEEEEEEE\n\nA little disappointed that they went with the anime \"shoot them in the limbs!\" instead of just hitting them center mass. I perfectly get not shooting the farmer conscripts, but come on, put the shots where they need to go.\n\nCalling it now. Mitsuha is going to feed that dragon an RPG.",

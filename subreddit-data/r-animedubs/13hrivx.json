                    "comment": "Ballard is someone I never gave enough credit until she basically proved me wrong like twice in a row about a half-decade ago.\n\nI always *liked* her, but I thought she was more-geared for a certain typecasting that leaned into comedy and antics, and couldn't play thoughtful, conflicted, or torn characters. Then she did Darling in the FranXX and Bloom Into You and was, as far as I'm concerned, absolutely perfect in both of them. I don't even like Bloom into You as a manga, but Ballard and Christian both gave so much emotional depth to some really shallow and unappealing manga characters. And Ballard's sultry-flirty but severely emotionally wounded turn as Zero Two was better than anything I could have imagined from any other active VA. When the 002 casting was announced for FranXX, I was incredulous. When the casting for Bloom was announced I thought \"Well OK she surprised me in FranXX but this is an entirely different emotional set again.\" After Bloom I simply decided that she's going to kick ass in nearly any role and I won't pre-judge her.\n\nThe weird thing is that one of the very first times I heard her was in Sankarea, which has since become one of my most-favorite series, and she absolutely plays a melancholy character in that, so I should have known better and not doubted her for heavy roles. The first time I watched Sankarea was when I was just getting back into anime after a long hiatus, it was one of the earliest \"modern\" anime I watched in a big batch alongside juggernauts like Spice &amp; Wolf and Steins;Gate, so I didn't have much awareness or memory for who was whom when it came to voice actors, so her name didn't really \"stick\" with me until (literally years later) I came to the realization that \"Oh of course Ballard is great at drama, she always has been.\"\n\nThere's been exactly one performance of hers that I've actively disliked (sorry, New Game's Hajime, but the forced attempt at tomboy just didn't work for me, and didn't sound natural) and anything else from her has always been pretty great.",

            "comment": "My First Girlfriend is a Gal had a great dub that breathed life and humor into what was otherwise a rather shitty anime series. The controversy around certain lines was massively overblown, the humor in all the non-controversial lines (which was most of the lines anyway) was on-point, absurd, and funny, and the hammy over-the-top nature of both the writing and performances were the only things making the show memorable at all.\n\nThe *only* nitpicky complaint I have is that it used the *acronym* \"SJW\" instead of saying \"social justice warrior\" fully. Using the acronym dates the line to a very specific era of internet slang (even today you already don't see \"SJW\" much) while the *full phrase* would have felt less-dated and easier for an audience to understand without requiring any knowledge of incel lingo from the mid-10s.\n\n*Edit, like a day later:* I remembered one more nitpick, and that was when the dub namedropped Jersey Shore. It was an attempt to be witty and topical, but the reference was *already* too old, and now it's positively ancient.\n\n&gt; I'll start: I think Monica Rial dub performances are either really hit or miss, very little in-between.\n\nTo build on this: Monica Rial has a *surprising* amount of range that very, very few shows even bother trying to utilize. Her \"adult\" voice is really, really damn good and she's almost never cast for it. Even as a mere arc villain, a rather ruthless pirate captain, in the second season of Snow White with the Red Hair, she absolutely crushes it. I don't *hate* her iconic moesqueak typecast, but it honestly feels like a shame that she's so-often relegated to that role when she also has a fantastic mature voice.\n\nRange is a big part of the reason I love her performance in Maid-sama so much. Between Misaki's brash man-hating school persona, her frustration and exasperation with male lead Usui, her generally congenial disposition with other girls and behind-the-scenes at her workplace, and then the various archetypes she has to be when her character is working at a maid caf\u00e9, the series lets her play around with her range way more than most other roles do.",

Monica Rial's emotionally charged performance in *Death Parade* is, to date, one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard in anime. I think it was only the second time I heard her in an adult role and it completely blew me away. Phenomenal stuff.\n\nIt's a shame she gets typecasted into the \"annoying young girl\" character so much because damn, she really can act.",

However if you have only about two - three voices that you can actually do well and act good that's more valuable to a casting director. Not every voice actor needs to be Mel Blanc and play half cast on his own",

It's a blatant double standard that no one really calls those people out on when they try to criticize English dubs in bad faith.\n\nAnother bad faith critique you'll see a lot for English dubs is saying how dubs lack emotion. Let's be real English and Japanese acting is completely different. Japanese acting is much more tuned to overacting and just being extra for your performance. While English acting is the exact opposite it's a lot more subtle and more reserved in comparison so you are going to seem less emotional because they're acting a different way.",

A lot of it is just sub elitists ragging on someone popular, but people here do criticize him as well.\n\nIt's less about him being a bad voice actor and more about him voicing like, a dozen Shonen protags and using the same voice for *every single one of them*, even when it doesn't suit the character. Shirou, Masaomi, Meliodas, Eren, Kirito, Rin, Adrien from Miraculous Ladybug, Devilman, Staz...same voice, same inflections, same acting style. For the most part at least. Like, he's a good actor, don't get me wrong (though maybe a little hammy sometimes), and his voice is pleasant to listen to, but at some point it just gets boring.\n\nin all honesty, it just feels like lazy casting at this point. And for me personally, his role as Eren is so iconic it's hard not to think about him when I watch any of his other shows. I for one am thrilled they didn't use him for Denji.\n\n&gt;I go back and listen to him and the Japanese back to back and they sound the same\n\nThat's...not inherently a good thing, though. I mean it's cool when the actors are similar but \"they sound the same\" isn't really a substantial compliment IMO. It's just neutral. They could have the same voice but be miles apart in skill level.",

Being \"acceptable\" or even mediocre was somewhat the best you could hope for. So when Bebop's dub came out and had some amount of craftsmanship put both into the scripting and acting, it was low-key revolutionary at the time. It somewhat defined what a good dub probably should be, and it took literal years - more than a decade in some cases - before studios really \"caught up\" to what Bebop did.\n\nThese days, from certain studios, you can even expect the most-generic of seasonal trash to get a dub that's more-or-less on par with what Bebop did, but that wasn't always the case. So, *now*, I don't think Bebop's dub really stands out. Hell, I think half the shitty isekai getting dubbed sound about as good as Bebop. It was a pretty landmark thing to have that quality back when it was new, and then you had some atrocious shit like Ah My Goddess and Love Hina or the original Tenchi Muyo stuff, shows that aren't necessarily as iconic as Bebop but still have deserve some credit for helping to define their genres, with dubs being indescribably awful.",

The ADV dub isn't that great either but it's at least entertaining in places.\n\nFMA and FMA Brotherhood have excellent dubs. Just because you've made it clear you despise a core actor in the dub doesn't mean the entire dub gets written off. They are superlatively well-directed by Mike McFarland. And yes, that specific core actor did a good job too.\n\nDBZ's dub is affected by the fact that the original version of the show was written for network syndication kids' blocks, and the Toonami episodes had to reconcile with that and also with the original, more cartoonish Ocean Group performances. It should be taken as a product of its time and nothing more.",

At best, it's audacious, but the charm disappears really quick.  \nPanty &amp; Stocking is a little better, but saying \"fuck\" 30+ times per episode isn't clever or witty.  \nAttack on Titan dub was mid.  \nHiDive is the best streaming service. Their subbed signs and OPs and EDs are a blessing, and their UI is nice and clean.\n\nProbably my worst take here: Honestly, even though I love \"the idea\" of dubs and almost exclusively watch them, most are worse than the original track, sometimes significantly so. I don't mind making changes to the script at all. It's the directing and sound mixing that are the biggest problems for me, and this isn't helped by the fact that most English voice actors are clearly untrained. Which is an unfortunate facet of western entertainment in general because it's simply not taken seriously as a craft. New VAs seem to be subverting this since anime dubbing is no longer a new thing, which is really great to see, but growing up watching anime in the 90's I think that most of the actors we considered to be good had *nice voices*, but not always the acting skills to boost it. I think this is true even now, just much  more rare.\n\nAlso, before someone says \"Cowboy Bebop dub was good for its time!\": I don't really care. It's been nearly 25 years, watch another show. Seeing it on every \"best anime dub list\" is obnoxious at this point when nearly any show out of the last decade outclasses it.",

I'm genuinely curious because I've never had a single issue with the website or the app, whereas Crunchy has been sub-optimal in many cases. And considering the $$$ behind the company, it has no reason to be the way it is.",

The site has crashed for me a few times here and there, even when my wifi was working just fine, but it doesn't happen often enough for me to stop using it. All I ever had to do was just refresh the page and move on.\n\nI think one of, if not the biggest problem with Hidive is that it's not available in other regions, and they rarely make subtitles in other languages than English.",

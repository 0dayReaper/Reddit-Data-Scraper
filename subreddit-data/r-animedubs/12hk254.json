I think i'll stick around for this one. If anything, I love hearing Lindsay Seidel and Ian Sinclair as leads. The rest of teh cast sounds solid as well. I think Caitlin Glass got herself another good one with this.",

Happy to say I was wrong.\n\nI\u2019m enjoying the mystery so far. This episode does a solid job of establishing some of the players but keeping each players motivations and standings blurry. A plus is that the novel seems to be set in a more grounded and vrealistic world, aka no magic. It seems to focus on political intrigue as well.\n\nLindsey is solid as Rinko with her being able to balance a more serious tone and her more childish one that she is known for. Ian is great at playing suave, bravado-laced characters.\n\nI\u2019m curious to see where things go, color me intrigued.",

It can't be ignored.\n\nI had to look it up and sure enough it's the same voice that ruined the _Mushoku Tensei_ dub.  I guess the problem _wasn't_ that she was trying to voice an adolescent.  It's the same exact voice with the same exact problems.",

The story about the Duke and Christina was sad but beautiful, and even though I agree with Challe that Anne was crazy to stay, I'm really glad she managed to make that amazing sugar confection. It was nice to see the light return to the Duke's eyes at the end. \n\nThere were so many adorable scenes between Anne and Challe - when he rushed back to rescue her, their reunion, and that hug when they were finally safe. These two have quickly become one of my favorite anime couples.",

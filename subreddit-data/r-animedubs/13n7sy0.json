    "postText": "It's been awhile, but I want to invest in an anime again. A romance one would be nice. (Dub of course).\n\nSo far I've seen: Say I love you, domestic girlfriend, my love story, real 3d girlfriend, rent a girlfriend, chobits, after the rain, sing yesterday to me, canned, ef, a lull in the sea.\n\n\nPretty much looking for recent ones in the 2010-2020s that I may have over looked. Help.\n\n(The romance kind where it's a guy and a girl). Not into those other kinds if one girl and bunch of dudes are in it and the harem ones...not so much into those.",

If anything  if feels more real to me to watch shows like Golden Time, Sing Yesterday To Me, and Science and I fell in Love. I guess college orientated/full grown adults anime is beginning to be what I go for, and it's both cool, and tragic because I have witness an emergence of beer drinking ladies eating Japanese snacks in a living room, an office worker who clearly looks like a little kid but is an adult, and that Uzaki-chan small chick with big boobies.",

That first scene is a real screener for folks though, but isn't really indicative of the show's content. I'd say it's more comedy than romance, but also not quite romcom. Apparently the source material gets more into the romance stuff. Also **Wave, Listen to Me!**. Not a lot of romance, but Funi puts it in their romance category. More comedy with a few romcom aspects/plotlines.\n\nAlso, **My Senpai is Annoying** and **The Ice Guy and His Cool Female Colleague** are both decent (personally liked the latter more than the former), with multiple romantic pairings.\n\n**Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World** has young, adult characters. It's more of an action romance though. Also, it's getting a S2!\n\nAnd I can't believe I forgot **Emma: A Victorian Romance** and **The Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent**. Both have some light reverse-harem elements, but I wouldn't consider either of the to be so. The latter is also slated for a S2.",

            "comment": "Three eps in and i think i can say that im enjoying S2 much more than S1. Really enjoying the Yuki-ona arc. I care for both Masayuki and Yuki-ona. I almost believed Kotoko\u2019s theory of Masayuki taking advantage of Yuki-ona\u2019s trust and affection. And part of me thought that we\u2019d get a twist that Masayuki was just a bad man all this time. \n\nLuckily, Kotoko is a little stinker (a funny one at that) and if anything, seeing Yuki-ona defend Masayuki true to the end makes me love her even more. I had no idea what to believe until Kotoko lifted the act. \n\nReally looking forward to see this mystery solved.",

            "comment": "That was strangely heartwarming. Put an almost perfectly reasonable theory of Masayuki using Yuki Onna for his own selfish gains, and Yuki Onna still trusts him enough to call bullshit.\n\nFeel bad for the ex wife, other than, you know, having her head bashed in. Masayuki only married her because she resembled Yuki Onna, and I'm sure she felt that lack of genuine affection.",

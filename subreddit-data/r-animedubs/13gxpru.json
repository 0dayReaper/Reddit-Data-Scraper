Gintama\u00b0 (Crunchyroll/Ocean &amp; Blue Water Studios, 2017 - episodes 266-316)\n3. Gintama (TV Tokyo/Universal Cinergia, 2019 - episodes 1-50)\n4. Gintama: The Very Final (Eleven Arts/Sentai Filmworks, 2021 - original movie)\n\nThe casts are entirely different in each of them with the exception of The Very Final. The three leads in that production are from Ocean's dub of the series. The rest of the cast mainly consists of reprisals from Sentai's earlier movie dub, with some replacements.",

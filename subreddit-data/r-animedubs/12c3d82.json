I guess the reason why people know where stuff is dubbed because sometimes people get curious about who\u2019s voicing their favorite characters so they end up searching up who voices said character. Then it leads to that person searching up which studio dubbed what show and so on and so forth. I\u2019ll admit at first I didn\u2019t really care about that but wasn\u2019t until I was watching a Naruto dub video and someone mentioned that Principal perry from Lab Rats voiced Naruto. I then searched it up to see if it was true and it indeed was which is how this whole cycle started. \n\nTLDR: People sometimes get curious about this especially with their favorite show.",

It may be a 90's one and there are some weak points, but there are strong ones, too, and I think it works well for this Anime to be in English because it's a fantasy.\n\nSlayers Series -- Lisa, Eric, Veronica, and Crispin are all fantastic in their roles as Lina, Gourry, Amelia, and Zelgadis.  Their chemistry is what makes the dub work.  First 13 episodes are iffy, but everything after all the way through TRY is great.\n\nHis and Her Circumstances -- I second (third) this as a great NY dub.  Veronica Taylor's Miyazawa is one of my favorite performances from her.  No weak links in this cast.\n\nIrresponsible Captain Tylor\n\nJungle Emperor Leo The Movie\n\nThe World of Narue\n\nAnimation Runner Kuromi 1 &amp; 2\n\nPhoenix\n\nMagic User's Club\n\nEverything by NYAV Post\n\nI know these may sound like eccentric choices and that others may think these dubs are no good, but as far as I'm concerned, these dubs hold up well to my ears.",

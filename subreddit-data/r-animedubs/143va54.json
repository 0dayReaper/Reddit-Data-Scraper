Robbie really fit the voice in my head for the character pretty instantaneously.\n\nAlso such a treat to hear R Bruce Elliot's Whitebeard again after so long, always really loved him in this role. So ready to hear more interactions between him and Roger (another classic OP dub voice we haven't heard in a long time) next drop.",

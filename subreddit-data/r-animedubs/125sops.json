            "comment": "(Just a preface, I'm SAG Eligible but my main focus has been film/TV, not voice over. So I don't know all the specifics. I'm still learning about the union as much as I can. But here's what I know. Plus, you can also look up the SAG-AFTRA website for more information as well - [https://www.sagaftra.org/membership-benefits](https://www.sagaftra.org/membership-benefits))\n\nUnion status refers whether the performer is in the SAG-AFTRA union. \n\nAll performing jobs can be categorized into \"Union\" or \"non-union\". From my understanding, Union jobs have a guarenteed fix rate, and a minimum amount of guarenteed hours work. Since voiceover is freelance, most one-liner voice sessions or wallas can be done rather quickly, possibly under an hour. With Union jobs, I believe actors are guarenteed a 2 hr minimum regardless of how many hours they work.\n\nThe union helps protect actors as well. They are the ones to report to if there is any misbehavior (like sexual assult or abuse). I also believe the union protects actor in allowing them to manage their sessions, like if an actor has been screaming all day, and needs to protect their instrument. And there is other benifits like insurance and pension and stuff. But I do believe that the performer must make a certain amount within the year to be elligble.\n\nMost of anime dubbing work is non-union. And pay for that is very low. I know there have been efforts to reach a new CBA for higher rates for voice over. But I can't say for certain, I wouldn't know. \n\nNon-Union members can absolutely do union work. I do believe after a certain amount of jobs or hours, you become what's called a \"must-join\". Meaning the next union role you book, you have to join the union. I do believe initiation fees are $3000, which is not cheap. But payment plans are available to my knowledge. Joining the union is a big step, and it's up to the actor to decide whether joining is right for them.\n\nOn the flip side, Union members can still do non-union work. It's called FiCore (Fiancial Core). It's generally looked down on as they are what the union refers to them as \"scabs\". but since a lot of anime dub work is non-union, I do beleive there are quite a few Union VAs who go FiCore to have access to those voiceover jobs.\n\nThe SAG-AFTRA website will do a much better job explaining and answering any question you have. But I hope this helps.",

But I can't say for certain, I wouldn't know.\n\nAnother thing that must be pointed out though (at least from what I've learned in various interviews I've read about Kyle McCarley regarding the Mob Psycho 100 season 3 fiasco), the reason most anime dub work tends to be non-union is mainly because a large majority of them are done in Texas. And IIRC, Texas is considered a \"right to work\" state, which are laws that are basically a massive F.U. to unions (you'll most likely see those laws in the GOP controlled states).  I'm not sure exactly the details on those right to work laws, but it basically limits union security agreements and collective bargaining.  That does not, however, bar union contracted work nor does it prevent workers from joining a union, but it does bar \"union-only\" shops (hence which is why SAG-AFTRA does have offices in Texas and you do occassionally see Texas based voice actors pop up in certain union contracted video game voice work once in a while).\n\nThere is also the Taft-Hartley Act that allows a non-union voice actor a free ticket to work on a unionized project if the project is unable to find union voice actor for a particular project, but after that, they need to join SAG-AFTRA or stop doing union work.",

Most other voice acting projects are prelay, meaning the voice actor records first before the character gets fully animated. Anime dubs is exactly what is is: dubbing. Voice actors are dubbing over already animated material.\n\nBoth require a different set of skills, and in my personal opinion, both are completely just as valid as the other.\n\nBut I think what gets people stuck is that once they've been doing something for so long, it becomes a safety net. But it also puts them in a very specific box that may make it harder for them to go into different mediums.\n\nAlso, I believe most prelay animated work is union work, so there is that big step that many VAs have to consider in joining the union to graduate to other things.",

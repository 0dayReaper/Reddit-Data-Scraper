However, for the 99th sacrifice, the human girl brought to the capital, Sariphi, intrigues the Beast King.*  \n*In fact, she isn't afraid of him or any other beast and even accepts her death without begging or crying, as she has neither home nor family to return to if she were released. The King finds her intriguing and let her stay at his side as his consort despite being human. This is the story of how Sariphi will become the queen of demons and beasts.*",

She's kind to all, she's willing to serve others despite being Leonhart's future queen, and is merciful to those who spite her. In a way, Leo and Sari complete each other, and I'm interested in seeing how their relationship with each other continues to evolve.",

She put food on the plate and offered it to them. They either had to swallow their pride and take it, or reject it and insult the king to his face.",

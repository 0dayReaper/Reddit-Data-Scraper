My aunt's helping me get in touch with VAs she knew to help get me started on dubbing work. I live a few hours away from the Dallas-Houston area but I don't have the time or the money to move to that area and record in their studio so I'm hoping I can stick with remote recording for now and move later when I have money. As stated before I wanted to do Gorou and Aqua but obviously that's not me but I am hoping I can try for Aqua's dad in the future.",

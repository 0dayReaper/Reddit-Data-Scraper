Some comments I've read claimed that Dekomori is an anime-original character, too. Plus the series as a whole places its focus a lot more on the central romance, which supposedly wasn't really a big element in the novel.\n\nGiven that Chunibyo is my favorite romance anime, and that I think Kumin is a pretty cool character, I'm definitely filing this under the \"best editorial decisions\" category.",

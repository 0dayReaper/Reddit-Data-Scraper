She didn't deserve the unfortunate luck of having to be a loose end to cut. It's just not fair sometimes.",

She was even trying to make hamburg steaks from scratch.\n\nAnd then she got shot.\n\nI wonder if the conclusion is Rei and Kazuki go permanently on the run, or they just say fuck you and dismantle the organization.",

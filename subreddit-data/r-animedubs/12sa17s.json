It felt like the whole season of some other anime packed into a parody version in one episode. And then when Mitama finally appears at the end and the real show starts it doesn\u2019t lose any of the charm and humor. Fingers crossed they keep the absurd comedy going (and yeah the cgi was terrible and also unnecessary but whatever I honestly just didn\u2019t care lol it was only in one brief spot)",

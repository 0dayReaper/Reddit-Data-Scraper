I wish it had more 'cause it kinda seemed like it had a story that was gonna pick up right as the show ends. \n\nThat being said, I do think what's there is definitely worth the ride. And at the very least you get to listen to the OP like twelve times so yeah.\n\n*edit: Also I feel like I should say that it totally does have a full story that it tells well. I just want more.\n\nAlso Nona is one of my favorite Jad Saxton roles.",

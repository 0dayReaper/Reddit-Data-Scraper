Erica voicing Kazuma has me dying, we even got a couple EXPLOSIONS!! EDIT: Faye is a riot as Megumin, her Explosion was perfect.\n\nI love this cast so much, they really give their everything to every line. Anyone who might be on the fence with starting Konosuba, these videos should be all the motivation you need.",

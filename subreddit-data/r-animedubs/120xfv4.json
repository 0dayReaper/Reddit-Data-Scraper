If it was something like Arte and established up front, then it gives time for our heroine to work towards her goal and defeat those norms. With this, we got guys physically abusing her (they pushed her off that platform by the way, at first I assumed she broke something), and ultimately treating her probably about the same they treat the fairies. Oh and jealousy is probably my least liked trope in romance, so I can't wait to see what's coming up. Also have they explained why this is Ann's last year to compete? Maybe they did last week but I must have forgotten.",

This jealousy thing is also super clumsy.\n\nIt wasn't explained why it's the last chance, but it was implied that she'd be restricted in some way. I got the impression they'd block her supply but they could change the rules.",

Probably would believe it more if we felt there was more struggle for Anne throughout the season. But we never got that feeling of sexism and Anne facing adversity from her fellow artisans or even clients even once. Unless I missed that it's just exclusive to this town she's working in?\n\nI will say that the new romance angle presented with Kieth and Bridget has me intrigued.\n\nAnd yay for a 2nd cour of this as well.",

Lifting heavy sacks, stirring viscous mixtures, and so on. The power of anime and pluck can take you places, but at the end of the day upper body strength is upper body strength, and a woman's not going to be as efficient as a man at the same tasks.\n\nThey were kind of dicks when she tried to apply some actual work ethic to her job, but that was a function of her rocking the boat, not her having XX chromosomes. I'd think a male character who said the same things would face the same admonishments.",

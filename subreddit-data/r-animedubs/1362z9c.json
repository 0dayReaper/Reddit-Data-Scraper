It's mostly early to mid 2000s shows, but it sucks when there's something in funimation and not crunchyroll that I want to watch.\n\n\nIt's like bro I did what they said. I lost my old price on funimation that was grandfathered in cause I was subbed for quite a while. Now it costs more and I'm just waiting for everything to move over, but who knows how long that'll take.",

It's frustrating that a pirate site has a better UI and fewer technical issues. AND NOW THEY ARE GETTING NEW STUFF BEFORE THE PAID SITES. \n\nSony needs to get this figured out.",

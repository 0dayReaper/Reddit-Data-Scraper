But again, it depends what kind of anime you're into.\n\nThat said... Now-a-days, Crunchy has a bigger selection of dubbed anime.  With Hidive, they'll dub about 1/3-1/2 of what they get.  Crunchyroll I'd say is about 85-90% of stuff that's not Aniplex.  (now-a-days)",

At the cheaper price point and with a (relatively) exclusive catalog (especially for dubs) they make an excellent *companion service* to something bigger like CR. By itself, they do have some niche shows with a few bigger hits.\n\nPeople shit on their apps all the time (and they don't even have a Playstation app) but all I can say is the one time I used their android app, it was functional, and I pretty regularly use their Roku app and it's better than CR's Roku app, though that's not saying much because CR's Roku app is old hot dog water.\n\nTheir website is very sluggish and you'll get some color banding in dark scenes on their video player, but the actual playback of videos *works* any time I've needed it to. I think there was exactly one time I remember the platform crashing when I *really* wanted to watch something, but I otherwise don't have any issues with buffering, skipping, or playback. Again, this is more than I can say for CR, which loves to throw \"Oops, something went wrong\" if I try to skip back or ahead by small increments.\n\nThey also offer subtitled OP and ED sequences for a lot of their shows, which is something that CR is inconsistent about. Some people might not care about those subs at all, but I think they're nice to have.\n\nI'm currently more satisfied with HiDive than I am with Crunchyroll at the moment, but part of that is because I have lower expectations due to the price, the realities of the current anime market, and available staff and finances for dub production. CR just really isn't worth the price to me, it doesn't provide the value I expect out of it, meanwhile HiDive is acceptable for what it is.",

They randomly get some good dubs too, but it's no where near the amount and quality of CR/Funimation.\n\nNot bad, but not worth the same amount you would pay for Crunchyroll for sure.",

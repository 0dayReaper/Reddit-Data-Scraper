I\u2019m aware also he\u2019s been around for a few years but I appreciate them casting for Denji someone who doesn\u2019t already have a major shonen role (kinda like Derick Snow with Fire Force or Dallas Reid with Black Clover)\n\nDidn\u2019t shortlist Suzie for Makima but she makes sense. Gotta get someone who can pull off both girl next door and commanding. And her Eula voice definitely matches that.\n\nSarah as Power is not surprising. I totally knew it was gonna be one of the \u201chigh pitch\u201d type VAs like her or Tia Ballard. I know sarah has quite the resume already. But I\u2019m expecting this to become her most iconic role.\n\nI\u2019m gonna need to hear more of Reagan as Aki. I always pictured him with more of a Robbie Daymond type voice.",

I was married to Kellen Goff as Denji in my head, but Ryan colt Levy sounds like a decent choice for the most part, I need to hear more Denji in both EN to JP to really say how feel about it though. I would not have guessed Suzie Yeung as Makima, also one I have to hear more of. Sarah Wiedenheft as Power is pretty interesting, I would\u2019ve pegged her for Kobeni. Regan Murdock as Aki is actually my favorite so far based on the trailer, he honestly sounds a little less generic than the JP actor.

Which works for Aki, especially at the beginning of the series where he\u2019s much more detached or at least he wants/tries to be. And we see those cracks in his personality with Himeno, and later Denji and Power. We\u2019ll see if the actors in both EN and JP are able to deliver in those moments. And performances in dub trailers are hard for me to judge due to how they are typically recorded as essentially standalone voice lines devoid of any context, as opposed to clipping it from the final mix.",

I always expected him to have the voice of a really mature young man. Idk well see.\n\nWhen I saw the trailer for sub I thought the guys voices shoulda been higher and girls shoulda been lower Im glad the dub at least made the female charcters a lil lower",

I wish they'd subtitled her conversation with Hika, but I guess that's supposed to just be part of the \"this is a language unknown outside this temple\" mystery. Speaking of mystery, I guess Hika actually *isn't* a child? They've kinda been hamming it up like he is with his behavior and drawing skills, but then Wade referred to him as an Old Geezer and then earlier mentioned something about him being \"sealed off\"? Hope we learn what that's about. \n\nAnd speaking of mysteries again, what y'all think that emerald is about? It gonna kill her? Trap her soul? Was the maid in on it, or manipulated? Who gave it to Chemal, anyhow? And why did she seem like she was ready to destroy it back when we first saw it, if it was going to help her get revenge on Raeliana? Was Beatrice the one who gave it to her, since she is apparently missing from where she's supposed to be in-game?",

That is, if she was reincarnated as the \"protagonist\" and was awaiting her \"destiny\" only for Raeliana to not only not die but also get engaged to the Duke she's supposed to end up marrying. I can see her trying to off Raeliana to get the ball rolling.",

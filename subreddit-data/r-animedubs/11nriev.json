Since you're kinda spoiled for choice, OP, IMO Shimoneta and High School DxD are both way better than they have any right being. \n\nLots of others on the list cover your criteria well but if you want your ecchi with some really clever social commentary and *really* filthy humor Shimoneta has you covered. If you want some anime tiddies with some fairly decent world building/characters and action than it doesn't get any better than High School DxD.",

Also, here's [a comment in my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/comments/pgn7uj/list_of_59_dubbed_shows_for_isekai_lovers/iovroig) where I also list 24 newer shows I didn't have in the original post.\n\nIt has them ranked by my preference, along with categories(like Ecchi or comedy), a description and short review for each show, episode counts, and links to MAL.\n\nI also made a [list of Ecchi or fan-servicey shows](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/comments/pmk0aw/any_ecchi_or_fan_servicey_shows_im_missing_from/) a while back if you want more than Isekai.",

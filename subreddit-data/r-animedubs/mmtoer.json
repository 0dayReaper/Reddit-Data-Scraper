Fortunately dub used to release just after 2 days the sub air during 4th season so I was able to watch all of s4 in dub. And no S5 which is just 3 weeks behind is really a good deal in this COVID situation",

                            "comment": "... it really wasn't bad at all, though. I mean it's mostly up to personal opinion, of course, but- Overhaul and Gentle Criminal were fantastic villains, the continuing League of Villains story was interesting, Nighteye Agency and it's characters were all wonderfully fun and engaging (particularly Togeta, imo), the \"large-scale rescue mission\" plot was compelling, Eri is absolutely adorable and a precious part of the story, and the festival arc along with the amazing concert (and Jiro's development) was tons of fun and very wholesome. No other shonen series does the \"part intense action, part slice-of-life\" thing quite as well as MHA, I'd say -- both are compelling\n\n\nI just don't see why people subjectively think season four is lower quality. Like, sure, it isn't as bombastic as season three, but that's because the end of the third season is the climax of an entire saga (U.A. Beginnings) and S4 is the beginning of the next saga (Rise of Villains)\n\n\nPlus, some of the best characters in the series were introduced- Togeta/Lemillion, Sir Nighteye, Fatgum, Hawks, Miruko, Eri, Gentle Criminal...\n\n\n There's more than plenty to love in the fourth season, so I I just don't understand the negativity\n\n\nIn the end, to each their own, suppose  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

However, I find the production side of season 4 to be where I have problems. Several of the episodes felt like a genuine drop in quality from previous seasons, and the pacing itself was a bit dragged out especially in the underground portion of the Overhaul arc. It was missing the snappy pacing that was prevalent in season 2 and most of 3.",

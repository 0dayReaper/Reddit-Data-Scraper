There are certain shows like New Game and Tanya that were licenced by Crunchyroll but dubbed by Funimation. When they split the first time, these shows ended up coming off Funi and going to Crunchy. \nI'm fairly confident this is why the movie was never dubbed and I sadly don't hold much hope for S2 unless remote dubbing allows for Monica and others to reprise.",

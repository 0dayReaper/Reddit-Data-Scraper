    "postText": "Please tell us a little bit about what dubbed shows you've been watching for the past couple of weeks, or currently watching right now. Old or new, as long as it's dubbed we'd like to hear about it. \n\nAnything good we should look out for? Anything bad we should try to avoid? Tell us a little bit of what you think. It's nice if you elaborate a bit on what it is you like or don't like about a show. That way your comment is useful to people who are looking for new anime to watch. :)\n\nWriting the names of the anime in **bold** is nice, to make it easier for people skimming the thread to pick out the names.\n\nSince this is also for people who are looking for new shows to watch, please use the spoilertag if you reveal any mayor plot points of the anime you are discussing (see spoilertag section in the sidebar for info on how).\n\n\nTo prevent low effort comments to steal the spotlight from people who put in a little bit more effort **top level comments in this thread must be at least 150 characters long** (roughly 3 sentences long).\n\n\n[You can find a list of the previous \"Your week in anime dubs\" posts here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/search/?q=author%3AAutoModerator+AND+title%3AYour+week+in+anime+dubs&amp;sort=new)",

The plot just isn't doing much for me.      \n          \nI watched Eminence in Shadows last weekend. That was dope. Especially as someone who watches a lot of bad Isekai.",

            "comment": "I'm halfway through my 2nd viewing of **Daily Life of the Immortal King**. Watching it with my twin bro, who wasn't familiar with donghuas before hand. And he's loving how ridiculous the show gets while still being a blast to watch as the same time.\n\nI'm a few eps away from finishing **Tokyo Ravens**. I'm still a little meh on the show. But really enjoyed the last ep I watched, the one where &gt;!Natsume dies!&lt;. Probalby the most engaged I've been with the show since I started.\n\nAnd it's been slow, but I've over the halfway point of **Interviews with Monster Girls**. Very comforting show that I'm looking forward to finishing\n\nLastly, since we're at the halfway point of the spring season, here's my enjoyment rating of all of the shows I've been watching thus far. [(Taken from MAL)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/season)\n\n* **Demon Slayer Swordsmith Village Arc** \\- 9/10 \n   * Enjoying it, not as much as Entertainment District Arc. Eager for the dub version though.\n* **Oshi No Ko** \\- 10/10\n   * AOTS so far\n* **Hells Paradise** \\- 10/10\n   * My favorite weekend show, love the two main characters and their VAs\n* **Dr Stone New World** \\- 10/10\n   * If it wasn't for Oshi no Ko, it would be my fave of the season\n* **KonoSuba: An Explosion on This Wonderful World!** \\- 7.5/10\n   * Not as entertaining as OG Konosuba (maybe because my Konosu-Best Girl is Aqua instead of Megumin), but still gets plenty of laughs\n* **Heavenly Delusion** \\- 7/10\n* **My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999** \\- 9.5/10\n   * Too much adorableness from the main girl and a decent SoL/romance show about gamers\n* **TONIKAWA S2** \\- 9/10\n   * Still love the warmth and sugar I get with each ep.\n* **Skip and Loaf** \\- 8/10\n   * The OP is too cute it makes me cry every time. Other than that, enjoyable SoL with memorable cahracters\n* **Insomniacs After School** \\- 9.5/10\n   * Really hope HiDive choses to dub this one, it's so sweet, tender, comforting, and I love the two mains.\n* **The Dangers In My Heart** \\- 8.5/10\n   * Was a little meh after ep 1, but I keep coming back and loving each episode that follows. I do think there is  another \"loner edge lord and cute pretty girl\" show that is better though.\n* **Ranking of Kings: The Treasure Chest of Courage** \\- 7.5/10\n   * I think it's because it's mostly filler and side stories, but this is one of the shows that just brings out really good performances from the VAs in them\n* **My Home Hero** \\- 7.5/10\n   * I do think it's an underrated show with some very nuanced voice acting to keep things feeling real and suspenseful, i'm on edge every ep.\n* **A Galaxy Next Door** \\- 7/10\n   * I think I'm a little more disappointed with this one than I was at the start. I think all the other romance shows I'm watching is hitting that sweet spot for me but not this one. Still enjoying it though.\n* **The Legendary Hero Is Dead!** \\- 4/10\n   * I'm a thigh weeb myself, so points there. It's trashy and fun, sometimes cringeworthy. Just remember to turn the brain off before watching.\n*  **The Reason Why Raeliana Ended up at the Duke's Mansion** \\- 6.5/10\n   * I love the voice acting and Raeli's monologues. Sometimes it does feel a little too slow, but the last ep did make me feel things that made me glad that I picked it up.\n* **The Caf\u00e9 Terrace and Its Goddesses** \\- 8.5/10\n   * Probably one of the bigger surprises, I think most might be turned off by 5 hot girls and assume it be harem trash. And it almost is, but it has a heart and charm that reminds me of Quint Quints. Everyone has something they want, and it's got a \"found family\" vibe under it.\n* **Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear Punch!** \\- 8.5/10\n   * It's cute, it's fun, it's punny, and Marissa Lenti is just so awesome as Yuna. (And I blame this sub for me doing bear puns every ep posting, so thank you.)\n* **Magical Destroyers** \\- 8/10\n   * Lots of insanity. It's like if *Kill La Kill* and *Rumble Garanndoll* had a baby, but the baby is three magical girls and an otaku driving a revolution.\n* **My Clueless First Friend -** 9.5/10\n   * Too much cuteness, and probably my favorite Sunday show to watch. Molly Zhang and Maddie Morris are just too good with the two main precious beans.\n* **Otaku Elf** \\- 8/10\n   * Fun SoL show. It's also very cute. \n* **Sacrificial Princess and the King of Beasts** \\- 8/10\n   * I love Emi Lo and Ray Hurd in this. I'm getting some Fruits Basket vibes.\n* **Too Cute Crisis** \\- 9/10\n   * Hope Sentai dubs this one too. Anyone who love animals or their pets should watch this. It's adorable and stupidass fun.\n* **Rokudo's Bad Girls** \\- 4/10\n   * I'm finding myself very bored with this show, and I strongly dislike the artstyle of it. But i'm already halfway in, so might as well finish it (Curse my \"no-dropping after 3 eps\" rule)\n* **Birdie Wing: Golf Girls' Story Season 2** \\- 10/10\n   * One of my top 5 faves of the season. And things are getting good!\n* **The Marginal Service** \\- 2/10\n   * \ud83e\udd2e\n* **Kubo Wont Let Me Be Invisible** (continued) - 9.5/10\n   * This has given me more sugar diabetus than TONIKAWA personally, too precious. And this is the other \"loner edge lord and cute pretty girl\" show I like better.\n\nPlanning to start/resume\n\n* **Mashle**\n* **Vinland Saga S2** (Netflix)",

            "comment": "**Ya Boy Kongming ep 1-5** - One of the shows I was looking forward to watching most now that I have a HiDive subscription. It's the fourth anime in my lineup recently made by PA Works, and it seems like everyone one of them so far is a hit. Even though I don't have that much of an interest in the music industry, this show is really carried by its main characters who have such fun personalities, and the opening scene with Kongming appearing in present day Japan on Halloween thinking he was in Hell (because everyone else was in costume) was hilarious. I love the little history facts too, and seeing how he applies his old war strategies to help Eiko's music career. The combination of history and the entertainment industry reminds me of two shows I'm watching this season, Otaku Elf and Oshi no Ko, and it's funny how well that blend works.\n\n**Last Exile ep 1-4** - This show has been on my list for a while, so I decided to participate in the rewatch on r/anime, but it's been a disappointment so far. The concept seems like something I would enjoy, but between half of the cast not showing much personality and others being obnoxious, I'm having a hard time caring about the story. Not sure if I'll stick with this one much longer, because even though the airship scenes are decent, most of the time I just feel bored with it. (Edit to add: Yeah, I dropped it at episode 5. Just didn't care about where the story was going from here.)",

Should be finishing it this week. I know I'm pretty late on this one, but it's alright. Hasn't blown me away, but I do love that the \"protagonist\" is really just a supportive mentor to the main girl character, it's something a lot of isekai don't do, and I appreciate it.\n\nNot watching any other dubs right now, but hopefully gonna pick back up and watch some more :)",

I especially loved the 2nd half of the season, those matches definitely had me excited and itching for more. I also like how they incorporated some of the characters backstories, it really added to the emotional aspect of the anime. At the end, I was genuinely shocked that &gt;!

They chose to go with a completely new cast, which I guess makes sense considering this is a reboot.\n\nAmusingly, some actors who were in Digimon Adventure tri. return but play different characters: Chermai previously played Biyomon but now plays Sora; Tara Sands played Kari but now plays Biyomon.\n\nI do wonder about the decision of using the Americanized names though (based on Marvel's cast list). I thought they would go the Shaman King route and move back to the original Japanese ones.",

But I heard he isn't too fond of his performance of TK and thinks he was miscast. \n\nWhich I guess when you look at his roles since then, makes sense. Most of the time since then, if he plays a teenage character it's one that has more of a mature \"cool\" voice. \n\nThat being said. I would've been fine if they kept him on as TK and just had him use a different voice. Cuz it's not like most the recasts even tried to match their original VAs. Tara actually did a good impression of Lara as Kari. But Robbie as Joe, Johnny as TK, and Vic as Matt were all pretty drastically different.",

I'm not naive to the impossibility of recapturing exactly the same cast and feel.\nCan't fault them for going in that casting direction and definitely can't fault the actors for embracing such a great opportunity, but sadly, by its very design, this just isn't for me.\n\nI hope that they're able to use this to introduce Tai, Agumon and the gang to a brand new generation and it hits the same for kids nowadays as it did for me. Best of luck, Digi-destined.",

For 2016 we recast. Stranger things have happened than keeping a cast between reboots, though obviously the time between is the biggest hurdle for this one.\n\nIt's fine, happened to Trigun, happened to Orphen, it's unavoidable.

Dude still makes money off of you.",

It definitely helped that most of the big and emotional scenes tended to lean heavily on the more veteran VAs (especially Emi Lo, Stephen Fu, and Kaiji Tang). There were a few performances and/or scenes that I recall being noticeably weaker, but it was solid for the most part.\n\nYou're right about some weird technical issues with the dubbing. It definitely seemed like some issues with the engineering/mixing. Also, it's been a long time since I noticed the \"lip flap\" issue (it's not noticeable to me in the vast majority of dubs, especially anything more modern), but this show had me checking my sound system a couple of times to make sure I wasn't experiencing audio issues with my setup.\n\nIt was just a shame, because this show would've been a 9+ for me with even an average dub. Too many of the big moments just ended up not hitting the highs they should've, or packed the emotional punch they should've, simply because they didn't sound right.",

Both the audio quality and the voice acting performance was not great, audio quality in particular was noticeably poor with certain voice actors\u2019 lines.  Think this is the only dub I\u2019ve watched (out of 221 completed on my MAL and that\u2019s pretty much exclusively dubs) where the quality was distracting at times.  Story and everything else was great and kept me in it though, would definitely watch again.",

I worry about this a year down the line with them jacking prices.) - I hope this transfer goes down without a hitch.  I still want my watchlists and queue from Funimation to move over.  I'd also like clarity if NEW episodes of currently running series on funimation will now start airing on crunchyroll IN ADDITION to funimation - or if they will just be coming to funimation for now.  Didn't seem very clear to me.",

With crunchy, that is just not the case.  So, it HAS to get better at indicating dub/sub - not falsely showing dub for shows that are not dubbed.  And adding a DUB search feature.",

In Crunchyroll\u2019s case, they seem to  want the default behavior to prioritize sub watching. Overtime, this will decrease the number of new dub watchers since the average user won\u2019t bother to do the extra work to find the dub version of the show. \n\nI hope I\u2019m wrong, but I have a bad feeling about this move to crunchyroll unless they change how dubs are selected in the apps.",

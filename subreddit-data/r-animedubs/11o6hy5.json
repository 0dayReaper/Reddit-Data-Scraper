            "comment": "A more serious episode this week as we get the details of Kazuki's backstory. It was really nice of his sister-in-law to try to help him move on and stop feeling like it was his fault. Now that she knows about Miri, I wonder if she'll visit from time to time (probably not too much though, since she's moving to France). \n\nRei falling asleep holding Miri's hand when she's sick was so sweet. He may feel like he doesn't know what to do for her, like which medicine she needs or where to find a doctor's office, but it's things like this that really matter to kids, so he has the right instincts. \ud83d\ude0a Asking Kyu for help was a good choice.",

            "comment": "It may be because of Survivors Guilt. But I guess I'm still trying to understand why Kazuki feels he's to blame for his late wife's death, when it felt like a \"wrong place, wrong time\" incident. He didn't shoot the bullet that caused the crash, which caused the explosion. Maybe i'm answering my own question, but maybe he feels that if he could've shot the guy first, then none of this would've happened?\n\nBut speaking of Kazuki, I've really grown to love Landon McDonald as a VA the past few years. I really loved the more serious bits of Kazuki we get to see.",

And, since he did take that job, if he hadn't missed the target wouldn't have carjacked the random and later explode all over the wife and unborn kid. ^^^phrasing",

The job was going badly, with his target fleeing onto a street where there were innocent bystanders (including his wife) so the sniper had to make the shot, rather than Kazuki managing to take him down in the empty alleyway as planned. Anime tends to exaggerate, but I'm pretty sure the goal for most hitmen would be to take out their target without bring noticed. If Kazuki's chasing this guy down in the streets in front of people, something must have gone very wrong.\n\nOf course, I don't want Kazuki to remain overcome by his guilt either, but I can see why he feels that way. A part of him probably wishes he never got involved in that line of work.",

Seeing your wife and unborn kid turned into burnt hamburger in front of you will fuck you up.\n\nThe other subplot of Kazuki quitting mothering for a day was overshadowed by the dead family subplot. Too bad. It could have filled its own episode.\n\nThe sister was the better looking of the two girls.\n\nI want an isekai spinoff for that umbrella.",

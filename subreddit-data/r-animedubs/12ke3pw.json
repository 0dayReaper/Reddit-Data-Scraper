I didn't like where they went with it at all.  To the point I DROPPED the show in the second half.  I get my opinion is not a majority opinion.  I just think it's worth noting that the show takes a pretty big turn in the second half in terms of direction.",

Then I got SO bored with the second half.\n\nI'm 3 episodes away from finishing it, but I agree with you basically 100 %.\n\nI liked how the story jumped back and forth between the viewpoints of Lena and the 86 in the first season, but Lena especially made it enjoyable for me. I was *hyped* when I saw how she'd changed after the the cour split (1st half of episode 12) \u2013 only to find that she gets basically zero screen time from that point on. This has basically reduced it to a mid show for me. I'll see if the last 3 eps can change that impression, but I doubt it.",

They had some good emotional beats, espcially the last half-episode. Not really enough to elevate my opinion of the show much on the whole, however. Of course, it also bears mentioning that I generally don't like action-heavy shows.",

Get a myanimelist account.  Put in some anime that you like.... And then click \"Recoms\" - and it will give you a nice long list of \"similar\" anime to those you have listed. --- MAL is actually how I have found a ton of anime I otherwise would not have found.  And when I was running low on anime after my \"initial\" batch of anime was complete.  Was the best resource for finding new anime. \n\nBecause yeah.  If someone told me this was what they had or have watched in anime.  I'd say... So you're an anime newbie.  Time to get out of the mainstream basics.",

Difference being Space Dandy has no deeper story and is nothing but a pure balls to the walls comedy.\n\nSoul Eater is pretty good, but nothing spectacular. But based on your taste, you'd probably like it the most of the ones I'm suggesting. Funnily enough, I like it the least.\n\nIf you wanna try something out of your comfort zone: Monster (2004). Phenomenal story with loveable characters.",

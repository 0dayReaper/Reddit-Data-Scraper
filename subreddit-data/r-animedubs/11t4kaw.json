They made a big deal of Amelia's chaos magic in the first minute... and then it turned into a boring fistfight. \n\nAmelia should've gotten her ass kicked since the other girl was specced for fisticuffs and Amelia gave up on using her chaos butterflies. It's as silly as Lebron creaming Magnus Carlsen at basketball, but giving up his advantage halfway through and sitting down to a chess game... and still winning.",

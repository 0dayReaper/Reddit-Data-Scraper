I assume when Cranston made it out of anime he never looked back. And while anime is incredibly mainstream now, I'd bet a lot of celebrities remember when it was the worst job available, and so you just don't see anyone able to get major roles do anime, unless Disney is backing a Ghibli movie dub.",

I was kinda hoping for a 24 episode season so that\u2019s too bad since it\u2019s my favorite feel good show of the season. \n\nHopefully we get a season 4. I really wanna see the music festival arc and more cute Ameri x Iruma moments.",

She\u2019s best girl after all haha. \n\nI still enjoyed this season but I don\u2019t think it was anywhere near as good as season 2. Though, in fairness, it\u2019s hard to top a season that had \u201cEvil\u201d Iruma and all those adorable Ameri and Iruma moments. Hopefully, we get all that and more next season (crossing my fingers that there is a next).",

Loved the finale when AzzAzz got a one up on Clara, the main three spending happy times together, the return of Milf AzzAzz, a touching scene, and finally an intro to purson!\n\nThis was such a treat that i loved spending my weekends with. I always have the most fun with this show. Loved this season too. Loved the new outfits, new personas, and that sense of accomplishment too. \n\nS4 cant come soon enough. Hopefully it gets greenlit for another. I know Jalen Cassell and the dub team have the blastiest of times recording for it.",

Sentai Filmworks (you can find their dub on Hidive) also made their own dub of season 1, but Crunchyroll took their place for season 2 while still retaining the same cast as Sentai's, though this dub sort of had to go through recasts due to issues with certain VAs; some temporary, some permanent.\n\nBoth dubs are very well done from what I hear, but I say go with the Netflix dub if you want a consistent cast. Crunchyroll's dub of season 2 might be a bit jarring since the voice changes are easy to recognize.",

For Netflix, it's always been consistently great and for season 2 it's about equal. Both dubs are in the same level of quality honestly, some voices fit better than the other for certain characters.

Netflix misses a lot of very obvious flaps to the bigger extend then jp id say. Script wise its simply lacking in finesse, dialogue is often very stiff like when reading subs. The swears in netflix dub were all censored and switched for light swears like \"damn it\" \"dang it\" and all that. Here you can find [example](https://streamable.com/wya7d1) number one and [example](https://streamable.com/3396yw) number two of such few scenes. Mind you the show is filled with those and i dont want to spoil anything but its not uncommon for them to do it. Netflix got rid of everything of the sort. Overall id highly prefer Sentai due to the mountain of fixes they did both comparing them to JP and Netflix releases.",

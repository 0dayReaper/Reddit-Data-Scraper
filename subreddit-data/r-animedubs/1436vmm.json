    "postText": "The film itself is a lot of fun and aside from the weird (yet legally mandated) renaming of Lupin to Wolf, this dub is pretty solid for 1992 standards.\n\nThe swearing doesn't feel out of place, the acting is good, the voices themselves fit the characters on screen, not seeing what's so supposedly bad about it that a lot of people say.\n\nI don't have the only UK DVD release that has the 2000 dub, I streamed it on Prime that has the Streamline version and StudioCanal (or whoever released it on Prime) seems to favour the 1992 one.",

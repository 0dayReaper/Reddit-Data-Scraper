    "postText": "**Synopsis from MyAnimeList:**\n\n&gt;Death is one of many mysteries that has left humanity in the dark since the dawn of time. However, the burning question of what happens to the soul after one dies is soon answered to 17-year-old Yuzuru Otonashi. Waking up with no previous memories in a dimension between life and death, he discovers the unsettling truth of the afterlife.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Taking the form of a high school, this bizarre dimension is designated to shelter those who died unwanted deaths. Feeling wronged by God during their earthly lives, the school's residents have decided to form the Afterlife Battlefront\u2014a rebellious faction determined to oppose their god-like student council president, Kanade \"Angel\" Tachibana. The group's leader, Yuri Nakamura, recruits Otonashi in their fight against Angel in order to take control of their own lives. However, questioning the morality behind their actions, Otonashi takes a step behind the enemy lines to understand the opposing side of their common fate. \n\n[Previous Anime Dub Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/search/?q=author%3AAutoModerator%20AND%20title%3AAnime%20Dub%20Discussion%20-&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sr_nsfw=)",

It's one of my least favorite studio Key animes, but that's still a high bar because I love them all. However, it's a crying shame that less than half of the cast got the development they deserved because of the short 13-episode runtime.",

I also had the pleasure of watching the show at a certain point of my life where I needed to watch a show like this. I can't say much about the dub because i  watched it on sub first, but I did watch a few episodes with the dub and it sounded good. The most common issue people seem to have with the show is the feeling of it being rushed. While I do agree that near the end, it does rush things, I still feel like it's a good show and worth watching. At least watch the opening song, which is so beautiful.\n\n I really do wonder how much better  the show would have been if it was about three or four more episodes long to help alleviate the rushing aspect.",

It was my first anime as a weeblet, and it was recommended to me by a friend. I've since introduced it to other friends for watch parties, and it just gets better every time.\n\nIt's got the funniest and saddest moments stacked back-to-back. Never a dull moment, looking at you Rocket Chair. The characters are all great, even though their screen time is brief at times. The story and it's themes are great. Even on a rewatch, I gained new context and meanings from the show. And then the music. Damn, I'll always remember the music, those damn piano notes. In only 13 episodes, it made me an anime fan ever since. Can't recommend this show enough.\n\nI pray to ~~God~~ ~~Buddha~~ ~~Angel~~ Yurippe that this show would get a remake with a full 25 episode season, as it was intended.",

And yes the same company that still no update to Granblue Fantasy the Animation S2 Bluray and the Bluray re-release of both TIAMHS S1 and Kaguya-sama: Love is War S1 with English dub.",

There was like a lull period in anime there for me. (some great stuff definitely came out of this time period including some of my all time favorites like Haruhi and Index). But...  It took me a second to get back into it.  But she's living her early teen years watching so much amazing anime.  And unlike me who I felt like had to scrounge for any speck of good anime (or watch it at weird times. I remember 6AM sailor moon haha) she can watch it at anytime. Anywhere. Wild.",

This would have been in 1976-1977.\n\nI was incredibly fortunate that there was a Buffalo, NY station (WUTV 29) whose programming director was either Japanese or some kind of proto-weeb or i never would have seen anime until decades later. Even that young I was able to see and appreciate how much cooler (read: not goofy) they were than American cartoons and they looked SO much better. I remember asking my dad why they were so different and him telling my it was because they were Japanese. That started a life-long fascination with all things Japanese (holy shit, *I'm the proto-weeb* in this story).\n\nThat same Buffalo station continued to air various anime all the way into my teens airing Robotech and a whole slew of others. I'd dearly love to find out who the person was that brought anime to my generation in my little corner of Ontario. They were a visionary and deserve some credit.",

So then I watched a handful of anime that would air on adult swim like samurai Champloo, and trigun and Big O. But I never really got into watching anime in earnest until I became an adult. I was very into video games and I didn\u2019t watch a lot of shows but a friend of mine convinced me to start watching my hero academia and I just fell in love with anime been going strong for a couple years now.\n\nStarted with the shonen\u2019s, but my favorite genre now is romance",

After that it gets a bit fuzzy what order I watched them in. I just remember binging fma, claymore, and soul eater over and over not knowing of other anime and having very limited options on Netflix until I one day got drunk, saw elfen lied, and said fuck it; worst case scenario is see anime titties, best case its good",

One of my first exposure to anime was Sailor Moon. I remember watching early in the morning to see it on tv.  Add in Samurai Pizza Cats to the list, as well. \n\nThen Pokemon being on Kids WB, and seeing a mouse with electrical powers was new because I don't remember Mickey Mouse doing that. But it was fun. Then add in Toonami on Cartoon Network going through the 2000s to include DBZ, Gundam Wing, Yu Yu Hakusho, Rouroni Kenshin, Big O, Tenchi Muyo, Naruto, and the others, I began enjoying anime every since.\n\nLiking anime lead me to reading manga, enjoying Japanese video games, and learning more about other cultures different than my own. Which played a part of why I got my Bachelor's in history among other things.\n\nEven now,  I still find time to watch anime, and enjoy the medium to this day.",

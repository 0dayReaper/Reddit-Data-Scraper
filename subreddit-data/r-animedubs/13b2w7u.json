    "postText": "I started watching anime fairly recently so maybe it\u2019s common but:\n I started watching re:zero in crunchyroll with the English dub, everything was great, except I couldn\u2019t understand one word so I set it to Japanese so that I could see the captions, except the whole episode changed when I did that.It was really trippy. Dialogues and scenes where completely different, the pacing and the way scenes developed was also different. \n\nEx:\nEnglish: \n\nVendor:\n\u201cYou look foreign, want an apple?\u201d\nSubaru:\n(Shows him money) \nVendor:\n\u201cNo one here accepts that crap here, stop wasting my time\u201d\n\nJapanese:\nVendor:\n\u201cYou want something\u201d\nSubaru:\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nVendor\n\u201cWa wa wa\u201d\n\u201c do you want something or not?\u201d\nSubaru:\n\u201c sorry man I\u2019m dirt poor\u201c\nVendor:\n\u201c then get out of here and stop wasting my time\u201c\n\nAdditionally in English it\u2019s 49 minutes long while in Japanese about 20. Despite this the dub skips over a lot and develops the scenes  faster.\n\nEdit:  I replayed it and the whole thing changes completely. Fuck the apple scene, the whole beginning is completely different. Which one am I supposed to watch? In the Japanese it changes the title to: S1 E1B part 2, does that mean I should watch it after the English one?",

            "comment": "Because localization.  I feel like I've had to explain this a million times. \n\nI speak a fair amount of Japanese and understand it decently. \n\nMuch of how Japanese translates English is not a direct 1:1 translation. \n\nDubs and subs both translate Japanese to English.  Dubs don't adapt subs.  They adapt the Japanese into an English dub.  And with dubs.  Unlike subs.  They have to make it sound right while being spoken.  Whereas, subs don't have to do the same.  So.  Most dubs seek to convey intention - rather than trying to get the 100% most accurate translation.  Or it might just sound... Not right.\n\nAs someone that has translated for people before...  Generally I try to make it sound correct for an English speaker, rather than give the exact literal translation.  That said.  Even most subs are not literal translations. And some of them are pretty awful.\n\nSo. That's your answer.  Subs and dubs are both translations.  And dubs don't adapt the subs to English.  They adapt the Japanese to English.  Independent of one another. And dubs focus more on intent and making it make sense.  Than subs do.  Because it needs to sound correct spoken.\n\nI think many English speakers think translating from Japanese to English is like translating Spanish to English or French to English.  Languages that almost directly translate 1-1.  That is not the case.  And it can actually leave a lot of creative liberty to the translator. Especially since Japanese is a very context heavy language.",

Like it gets its point across, but the dialogue text shows like some very basic communication between characters. It doesn't necessarily make it more or less interesting, but it does affect how you absorb it. The dub will flare it up a bit where it sounds more natural.",

They often feel like a very watered down version of the dialogue to keep it simple. I know there are some restrictions to the subtitles just like there is for the dub itself. But it just seems like the dubs (and of course it's not always the case) take more time for that localization to feel more natural for English speakers.",

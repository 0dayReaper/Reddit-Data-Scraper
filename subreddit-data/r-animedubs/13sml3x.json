Naturally, all who reside in this world can use magic. Magic is a normal part of everyday life. But deep within a certain forest lives a boy named Mash and his father-figure, Regro. Mash was frequently told to avoid going into town. The reason being, the mark that is ever present on everyone\u2019s face does not exist on Mash \u2014 for he cannot use magic. One day, while Regro is away, Mash ventures into town to buy his favorite cream puffs....",

He does a great job of capturing the general indifference to most non cream puff related things like Mash does.\n\n\u201cWhat, you wanna make out with me?\u201d Made me do a spit take\n\nI love Mash\u2019s logic of \u201chuh let me destroy your uniform to clean it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s simple but I love Regro\u2019s backstory, you see why Mash is so devoted to him.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t just Pshh my spell away?!\u201d \u201c\u201dOh no he dribbles like a Boss\u201d I love this script\n\nA fantastic start to the Dub. I will say Mashle holds a special place in my heart as the series that got me back into Manga and then Anime and I\u2019m glad to see other people hopefully enjoy it as well.\n\nPs I\u2019m glad the anime captured Komoto\u2019s (Mangaka) weird way he draws feet.",

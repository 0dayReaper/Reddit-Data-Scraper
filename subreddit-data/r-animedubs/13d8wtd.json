That said, HIDIVE\u2019s quality is still pretty good. Food Wars, Danmachi, and Log Horizon are personal favs along with smaller shows like Call of the Night and Ya Boy Kongming!",

Bloom Into You, and Kase-san and Morning Glories were excellently  cast (the latter got Morgan Berry into a Sentai dub too). Haikyuu is great. Pet Girl of Sakurasou was a great cast too. Even older stuff like Chuunibyou, K-On season 2, Outbreak Company, No Game No Life, and many more. The bigger concern is just hoping a show gets dubbed at all.",

I think Sentai excels at SoL, but their dubs for more fantasy/action oriented shows are more hit-or-miss. I think it's ultimately in the voice direction; Sentai's just doesn't feel as sharp and consistent compared to CR's.\n\nThe audio mixing is another big difference for HiDive dubs. To my ears, their mixes sound like they don't cut out as much of the bass and mid frequencies for voices as other studios do, causing their audio tracks to sound a little boxy, less polished, and like they always sit on top of music and sound effects instead of being level with them.",

Sentai as a whole is still fairly hit or miss when it comes to dubs imo, and having less directors &amp; writers + a smaller talent pool doesn\u2019t really help in terms of output. Not to mention I don\u2019t love their style of sound mixing compared to most other studios.\n\nThere are a few standouts (Bloom Into You, After the Rain, &amp; Made in Abyss S2 come to mind) as well as a few dubs that *almost* fully hit the mark baring a couple elements here and there (maybe a poor casting choice or two, a divisive directorial decision, etc\u2026). But they are peppered with a lot of average or mediocre dubs in between, with the occasional awful one from time to time.\n\nDespite Oshi no Ko\u2019s popularity, I\u2019m not expecting anything really groundbreaking with its eventual dub when it comes to who\u2019s directing it and the cast list. I think at most we could see one or two TX names that don\u2019t show up in a ton of Sentai dubs.",

I've never had this issue with any other dubs but hidive ones.\n\nI've had 3 different sound systems over the past 4 years and it's been the same on every single one.\n\nThe dialog/voices sound a tad off in the mix like the way they recorded it in there. I duno I know I'm not crazy as my friend noticed it too and it's only hidive, not crunchyroll or anything else.",

Food wars is a great example, S1 and 2 is their but rest are missing. SNAFU S1 and S3 avilable but S2 is missing and many more",

Alyssa Marek isn't bad, but her voices for Akiba Maid War and Iroduku were, like, just her voice. On the dude side Joe Daniels is great and Jack Stansbury is solid.\n\nThey also paid Adam Gibbs, who you might know from Everything, to play a side character in Iroduku.

            "comment": "I always forget the one of my favorite aspects of Bofuri is the montage of exploring a new area with some relaxing insert music in the back. Also really loved that the insert song \"Good Night\" came back.\n\nOn top of Maple being Maple, loved seeing Syrup and Oboro's evolution. Really like seeing everyone get companions, now it also feels like it's a pokemon game.",

Frederica fight is the perfect representation of trying to learn a fighting game (or any competitive game) that is several years old and most of your opponents online are just people with several tournaments worth of experience who won't give you even a second to breathe.",

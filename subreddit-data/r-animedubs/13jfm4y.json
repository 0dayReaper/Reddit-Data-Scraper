She'd been training and doing a lot of community threatre both in the Houston area and in Dallas. She didn't get her first taste of voice acting until she was in college, but since then, she's found regular work doing both stage and voiceover work at and around her area. She made her anime debut in 2018, and has been a frequent regular ever since. \n\nOutside of acting, she loves animals (especially marine life, horses, and her dog), a mom, a talent agent, and an avid reader and photographer. She is also IRL besties with fellow voice actor Dani Chambers.\n\nWhat are your favorite roles?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Miranjo** (Ranking of Kings): Def one of the roles that surprised me the most when I saw her cast as Miranjo. A different and emotionally complex role that was challenging but I thought she, like with everyone in the show, rose to the occasion voicing her.\n\n\\- **Yuriko Tsumura** (Smile Down the Runway) - Out of all the moms she's voice, I think this one is my favorite. Especially that one \"Letter to her son\" scene.\n\n\\- **Sakura** (Urusei Yatsura)\n\n\\- **Emma Spring** (Astra Lost in Space)",

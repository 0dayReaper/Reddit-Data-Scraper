    "postText": "Need help finding a certain anime I watched over 10 years ago. I vaguely remember it having a green monster with red eyes that drunk a bunch of booze and he fought against a group of women if I'm not mistaken. It'll probably be pretty hard to find the name of it because I'm sure it was one of those less popular older anime. I originally thought it was Sailor Moon, but I'm not really sure anymore after watching through it.",

Anything in particular you can say about its art style and/or character designs? What about the music; anything you can recall about that?\n\nYour initial description is just too vague as is so any more details you can give will greatly increase your chances of someone recognizing it.",

He obviously nails comedic stuff really well (see Space Dandy, Brook, various narrator roles, etc...), but can pull off charming and sincere so well. I know Caitlin has cast him as a SOL/romance lead before in Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent, but I never watched it.\n\nHis couple standout moments in Fruits Basket are still some of my favorites from him, and that's saying a lot considering the roles/shows he's been a part of.",

Though with Tonikawa and Tomo we know they were co-produced basically with Crunchyroll. So they could officially step in to make the production try and match what they would want for western release. Same way Netflix does same day binge drops sub &amp; dub for some anime. I guess Raeliana also has Crunchyroll production involvement. A vast majority of the time, they basically just hand off the material to western licensees at their leisure, which doesn\u2019t give enough time to match the sub.",

It seems to skew towards romance. Western VA work is generally done one at a time with each character so a larger cast could bog things down, compared to the Japanese group recording style. \n\nBut I think the primary obstacle to simuldubs is just facilitating a production schedule that allows for western studios to get their hands on the material early enough so that they can produce dubs without delay. It\u2019s probably already a hassle trying to get stuff to subtitle in time. Dubs take at least multiple more weeks of work. Episodes aren\u2019t finished right before airing on Japanese TV, but the amount of time left before airing probably varies, which affects foreign distribution way more than local.",

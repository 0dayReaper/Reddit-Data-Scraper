Both the audio quality and the voice acting performance was not great, audio quality in particular was noticeably poor with certain voice actors\u2019 lines.  Think this is the only dub I\u2019ve watched (out of 221 completed on my MAL and that\u2019s pretty much exclusively dubs) where the quality was distracting at times.  Story and everything else was great and kept me in it though, would definitely watch again.",

I\u2019ve struggled through some poor dubs in the past, but Summertime Rendering is the first one that nearly made me stop watching. The writing is horrendous (constant pauses that make no sense within the context of the dialogue in order to match mouth flaps) and audio quality is terrible for a few of the characters.",

There's also ***Shiki*** and ***When They Cry*** (Sadly, only the 1st season has been dubbed in English).\n\nOh, and perhaps something like ***The Future Diary*** or ***Talentless Nana*** might be interesting to you, too.",

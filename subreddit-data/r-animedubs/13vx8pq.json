They never specify whats available in what language, on their site or social media updates. Last I checked you cant even search their site for dubbed only shows? A member of the forums were maintaining a list of dubbed shows",

But I do know that Howard Wang has incredible passion for it.",

Add to that the entire Prince of Tennis II which has 43 episodes and that's 171 episodes. And that's not even including the movie and the 2 episode OVA that they dubbed. So at this point, if they wanted to dub the rest, it would be 50 more episodes of the original 178 episode run plus 34 episodes of sequel OVA episodes if they intend to dub those (84 episodes in total).\n\nThat would mean that they have already dubbed two thirds of the entire series. So they might as well finish everything. They also implied that they would dub 4 other movies/OVAs of the series in addition to everything mentioned before.",

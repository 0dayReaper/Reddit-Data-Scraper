It wasn\u2019t my favourite but it\u2019s not a bad watch by any means)\n\n~Aharen Is Indecipherable (hella underrated, the two MCs actually talk to each other like real human beings and they\u2019re cute af together)\n\n~My Dress-Up Darling (this one exploded onto the scene, just beware it\u2019s pretty fan service heavy)\n\n~Komi Can\u2019t Communicate (not immediately about romance but slowly builds. Keyword being *slowly,* but still a very feel-good anime that\u2019ll make you smile A LOT)\n\n~Don\u2019t Toy With Me Miss Nagatoro (yea yea I know, it\u2019s a controversial one but as someone that\u2019s kept up with the manga and has seen the characters grow, watching them come to life on the screen and evolve as people just really hits different)\n\n~When Will Ayumu Make His Move [NO DUB YET] (while it currently lacks a dub I still recommend this one, same author that did Teasing Master Takagi-san, equally as cute)\n\n**Some more recent ones that aren\u2019t quite \u201cold\u201d just yet but nothing new:**\n\n~Gamers (\u201cMisunderstandings: The Anime!\u201d It\u2019s a silly goofy one that isn\u2019t meant to be taken too seriously, it was a fun watch)\n\n~Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun (this one doesn\u2019t get enough love, it is one of the most under-appreciated series imo and I really hope we get more of it in the future)\n\n~Teasing Master Takagi-san (this is one of my all time favourites and is another manga that I currently keep up with. One of the cutest shows I\u2019ve ever watched)\n\n~Your Lie In April (while it\u2019s kinda about romance, it\u2019s also a \u201cyou\u2019re gonna cry, a lot\u201d show. If that\u2019s not your thing I totally understand)\n\n~Rascal Does Not Dream Of A Bunnygirl Senpai [NO DUB YET] (it\u2019s criminal we still haven\u2019t gotten a dub for this, but it\u2019s such an incredible piece of art that I can\u2019t NOT recommend it. It also gets super emotional at times and will pull on the heartstrings. One of the few animes I\u2019ve given a perfect 10 on MAL)\n\n**10+ year old classics that I watch when I want some nostalgia (and also to cry cuz damn I\u2019m starting to get old):**\n\n~Love, Chuunibyou and Other Delusions (this one just strikes a chord in me that makes me ascend to another level of being, I can\u2019t even put it into words, it just feels so magical)\n\n~Toradora (it\u2019s tradition for most fans to do a yearly rewatch every Christmas season. I do that and then some. One of my very first romance animes and it holds a special place in my heart. Easily in my top 5 of all time)\n\n~Maid-Sama (another classic that just clicks on every aspect of the genre. Cheesy, corny, funny but there are a lot of genuine romantic moments between the MCs and I like to revisit it every now and then)\n\n**Others I have not watched yet but I hear are very good:**\n\n~Horimiya\n\n~Your Name\n\n~I Want To Eat Your Pancreas (strange title ik)",

And I'm not talking about the quality, everyone who worked on it was absolutely brilliant, but voice actors for characters are changing like constantly. S1 is consistent, but Netflix did S2 and recast *everyone*. S3 was back with the most of the OG voice cast, but there were several episodes where MCs got sick or something and they got a temp replacement. There were also some inconsistencies with how Takagi's name is pronounced across the seasons, though it is always consistent within a season as far as I remember. Sometimes it's TaKAgi, sometimes it's TAkagi, and sometimes it's TaKAgi-san. \n\nAll that said, it's still a very good show. None of this bothers me all that much, but if you're the kind of person who gets bothered by VA changes, just letting you know this show has them.",

The fact that they don't give her an inner monologue makes it a lot more of a guessing game vs most rom coms that just lay out both parties feelings and iust make you wait for the payoff. It has the most rewatch value of any rom com and more than most anime, probably partially due to the former point. They do lewd humor really well without going over the line. First time I watched it my neighbor definitly heard me cackling even in the first episodes. \n\nThere's no love triangles or harems, just 2 people with fun chemistry who care about each other. The jokes are top tier and the actual story is heartwarming af.\n\nOnly warning is the first episode is rough the first time around, cause of the no inner monologue you're left wondering if she is a total pos by mid episode.",

            "comment": "***Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions!*** is my favorite anime of all time and my favorite romance series. It's technically more of a romantic comedy, but the relationship is utterly endearing in my eyes. The main characters get together in the middle of season 1 and slowly, but surely (which actually makes sense in the context of the story) make progress throughout season 2, with the final movie giving them a wonderful resolution.",

            "comment": "Copy Pasting my usual answer since this thread pops up pretty frequently\n\n**Some ones from the last year or so I enjoyed very much:**\n\n~ Tomo-Chan Is A Girl (shot into my Top 5 Romance animes easily)\n\n~Romantic Killer (relatable af lol)\n\n~Kaguya-sama Love Is War (basically a masterpiece, and the best part of it is the Narrator)\n\n~Shikimori\u2019s Not Just A Cutie (a lot of people don\u2019t like it because of the male MC being \u201cwimpy\u201d but I didn\u2019t see much of a problem with him. It wasn\u2019t my favourite but it\u2019s not a bad watch by any means)\n\n~Aharen Is Indecipherable (hella underrated, the two MCs actually talk to each other like real human beings and they\u2019re cute af together)\n\n~My Dress-Up Darling (this one exploded onto the scene, just beware it\u2019s pretty fan service heavy)\n\n~Komi Can\u2019t Communicate (not immediately about romance but slowly builds. Keyword being slowly, but still a very feel-good anime that\u2019ll make you smile A LOT)\n\n~Don\u2019t Toy With Me Miss Nagatoro (yea yea I know, it\u2019s a controversial one but as someone that\u2019s kept up with the manga and has seen the characters grow, watching them come to life on the screen and evolve as people just really hits different)\n\n~When Will Ayumu Make His Move [NO DUB YET] (while it currently lacks a dub I still recommend this one, same author that did Teasing Master Takagi-san, equally as cute)\n\n**Some more recent ones that aren\u2019t quite \u201cold\u201d just yet but nothing new:**\n\n~Gamers (\u201cMisunderstandings: The Anime!\u201d It\u2019s a silly goofy one that isn\u2019t meant to be taken too seriously, it was a fun watch)\n\n~Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun (this one doesn\u2019t get enough love, it is one of the most under-appreciated series imo and I really hope we get more of it in the future)\n\n~Teasing Master Takagi-san (this is one of my all time favourites and is another manga that I currently keep up with. One of the cutest shows I\u2019ve ever watched)\n\n~Your Lie In April (while it\u2019s kinda about romance, it\u2019s also a \u201cyou\u2019re gonna cry, a lot\u201d show. If that\u2019s not your thing I totally understand)\n\n~Rascal Does Not Dream Of A Bunnygirl Senpai [NO DUB YET] (it\u2019s criminal we still haven\u2019t gotten a dub for this, but it\u2019s such an incredible piece of art that I can\u2019t NOT recommend it. It also gets super emotional at times and will pull on the heartstrings. One of the few animes I\u2019ve given a perfect 10 on MAL)\n\n**10+ year old classics that I watch when I want some nostalgia (and also to cry cuz damn I\u2019m starting to get old):**\n\n~Love, Chuunibyou and Other Delusions (this one just strikes a chord in me that makes me ascend to another level of being, I can\u2019t even put it into words, it just feels so magical)\n\n~Toradora (it\u2019s tradition for most fans to do a yearly rewatch every Christmas season. I do that and then some. One of my very first romance animes and it holds a special place in my heart. Easily in my top 5 of all time)\n\n~Maid-Sama (another classic that just clicks on every aspect of the genre. Cheesy, corny, funny but there are a lot of genuine romantic moments between the MCs and I like to revisit it every now and then)\n\n**Others I have not watched yet but I hear are very good:**\n\n~Horimiya\n\n~Your Name\n\n~I Want To Eat Your Pancreas (strange title ik)",

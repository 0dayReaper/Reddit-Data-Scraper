If I didn't love Re:Zero, I'd agree that there isn't much need to watch both. However, as it easily makes it into my Top 5, I welcome any excuse to watch it all over again.",

However, it's distinctly tonally different from Priscilla that I could still see Faye voicing her, though we'll see what happens. \n\nThe only one who I'm expecting to *not* come back at all is Marc Diraison as Wilhelm. I remember he was too busy to even reprise Kayaba in SAO Alicization, nor Wilhelm himself in the simuldub for Isekai Quartet S2. I'd be genuinely surprised if he did come back, but I'm expecting someone else to play the role moving forward.",

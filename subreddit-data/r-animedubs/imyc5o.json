Khoi Dao was initially this when he got the lead in March Comes In Like A Lion, but that has clearly changed over the years he's been working if you look him up some more.\n\nAs for Lucien Dodge, Play Dust An Elysian Tail guys from 2012, seriously.

That may sound a bit mean but that's just how i feel in regards to it, though I'd never say that to them, that's too mean.",

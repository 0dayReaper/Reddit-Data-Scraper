    "postText": "Watched the game wars (World War Blue) between Nintendo (Ninteldo) with Mario as a buffed up general and Yoshi as a dragon and Sega (Segua) with anime boy Sonic after vengeance when Tails is murdered . Link is a psychopath and overall I enjoyed it despite it being average in terms of storytelling. Funny concept it executed better could have been amazing. Any anime u stumbled on that you thought was amazing to good?\n\n\n\nSide note could use some recs if you don't mind\n\nhttps://myanimelist.net/animelist/JuanPonchMan?status=2",

Most of the best anime I've ever watched... Don't get talked about all that much.  Heck.  I've watched so many animes at this point that sometimes I'll just start watching something without knowing much about it at all just because why not. \n\nI have my MAL on my profile if you want to check out my watched animes.  It's pretty long.  (And the funny thing is.  It could probably be longer than this!  There are many animes I watched back in the day that I didn't add to my MAL because it didn't feel fair rating them having had not watched in like a decade or more.)",

I watched chaos;child on a whim, thought it was decent, googled season 2 (I do believe it did get one eventually, but not at the time I'd googled.) And through that discovered steins gate.

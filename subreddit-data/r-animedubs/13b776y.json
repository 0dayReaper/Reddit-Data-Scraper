They always have the sign and songs subtitled on the sub track so why can't they just add it to the dub track? They never go back and add them in either. If they don't appear when the episode is uploaded, it's over. I'm watching shows from a year ago to catch up to the current season airing and the text isn't translated in those episodes either.",

Due to covid because they out sourced to South Korea and now South Korea is on lock down with Covid Spreading from China. Out sourcing may help but in these unpredictable times it probably the worst thing you can do! There was no announcement till a month after last ep it had came out April 1st not a single one after that, then like 3 weeks after the company doing it said they had about 4-5 anime\u2019s delayed to JULY.",

Love Trigun Stampede and its take on Vash, the CG was well done and Orange knocked it out of the park and the rough edges I noticed early on were smoothed out real quick and can't wait for more. I thought Akiba Maid War despite being somewhat predictable was a lot more bad ass than I thought it would be and enjoyed it for what it was. Shadows House is one I think should get more attention because it was phenomenal. Basically what I'm saying is give me some of the overlooked or barely talked about shows you watched in the last 24 months or so that you feel people should give a chance or that you enjoyed more than you thought you would.\n\nEdit: release period doesn't matter",

            "comment": "There have been a few overlooked gems from the past couple of years but for me these 5 are what I would recommend for being way too under the radar:\n\n-\t**Uramichi Oniisan** - A comedy anime about an ex-gymnast turned children TV show host that puts on a happy act in front of the kids but in reality is a depressed adult when the camera is off\n-\t**Blue Period** - OP mentioned Trigun and the main character here is voiced by the same VA as Vash. It\u2019s set in an art college prep school and can be quite emotional at times\n-\t**Sonny Boy** - This anime is simply a trip. I won\u2019t divulge further but it has a cool premise and even cooler soundtrack\n-\t**Akebi\u2019s Sailor Uniform** - Minus that one controversial scene in the first episode, this is a very wholesome anime about cute schoolgirls doing cute things\n-\t**Romantic Killer** - An otaku girl is \u201cforced\u201d to go on dates with guys like she\u2019s in a dating sim game in order to get back her favourite desires. Proper progression of a character\n-\tBonus anime: **Natsume\u2019s Book of Friends** - The dub only started very recently and is currently in the third season but this has been a knockout of feels to watch",

            "comment": "Firstly, 100% agree on Shadows House. I felt like it got a bit overshadowed at first by being compared to other recent shows (at the time) that were kind of similar, but \"grittier\", like Talentless Nana and Promised Neverland.\n\n**Godzilla Singular Point** is one that I can kind of understand why folks didn't enjoy it. The animation and aesthetic probably aren't for everyone (I found it pretty charming though) and they drop a lot of math, CS, and physics concepts to the point it can sound like word salad. That being said I just really liked it. I thought the dub was good, the concept was interesting, and the characters were fun.\n\n**The Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent** is one that I don't think got quite as much love or attention until the recent announcement of S2 brought the spotlight back to it. It seems like it's going to be one of those Otome game type shows with a reverse harem and some dark undertones with noble society and all that. Instead it's a pretty sweet story about a bit of a wallflower with a cute romance (with some light harem elements), and the wholesome relationships she develops with almost everyone around her.\n\n**Eden** was another one that I really liked, but didn't seem to gain much traction.\n\n**Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut** isn't one I think really flew under the radar. It just feels like more of a flash in the pan that left the anime community's collective consciousness as quickly as it entered. If you like the space race, this is definitely one worth checking out.\n\n**Banished From the Hero's Party, I Decided to Live a Quiet Life in the Countryside** is another one that just didn't quite seem to do it for most folks. I kind of get it. It didn't feel like the story could quite decide what it wanted to be. It was mostly a Fantasy SoL, but kept interjecting action sequences that still managed to not be very action-y. The drama (and titular plotline) ended up being pretty melodramatic at times as well. That being said, I still really liked it and am psyched that it's getting a S2.\n\n**Faraway Paladin**. Honestly, my only real complaints about this show are that Erica Mendez should not have voiced the MC after he grew up, and that the show is BL-baiting pretty hard (I don't know the source material, so maybe there's actually a good reason for that).\n\n**I'm Quitting Heroing** was one that I didn't really like much the first time watching. But upon a rewatch, I really liked. The show has a lot more heart than the fantasy workplace comedy the first \u00bd-\u2154 comes across as.\n\n**Heroines Run the Show** is another one that seems to be fairly well reviewed, but I rarely hear folks talk about. I LOVED this show. I don't generally like idol shows, but this one is definitely an exception. I think the decision to not give the MC the usual \"Kansai accent\" in the dub was a great decision. As usual Sarah Wiedenheft absolutely crushes the role, and manages to work in folksy-ness into her character without making her sound like the product of 3 generations of cousin marriages from a hollow in the Appalachians.\n\n**The Yakuza's Guide to Babysitting** isn't really unpopular or poorly received l, but just felt like one that might have been kind of easy for folks to overlook.\n\n**Raven of the Inner Palace** was one that I personally didn't see much mention of, but thought was utterly fantastic. I'm not usually a fan of the more episodic format shows, but this one does a good job of using that format to paint a larger picture and contribute to a larger more comprehensive story. The mystery of the week format was done really well, and definitely reminded me a bit of Gosick (one of my all-time favorites). That, plus the Josei tag, definitely meant that this one completely subverted my expectations.\n\n\nEdit: some spelling, grammar and formatting",

I never thought a show about a card game about Japanese poems would interest me but it has blown every expectation out of the water. The way it portrays relationships, ambitions, interpersonal growth, the different stages of life and just everything in between is perfect. Each character has its own beautiful story and the dedication put into is rare. It's a shame the release period has been butchered for it so hard because it's up there with March Comes in like a Lion as one of the premier shows in anime.\n\nAlso I can say for certain that this is one of Sentai's best dubs. Not the biggest fan of them but they have knocked this show out of the park. This and Haikyuu show Sentai's potential with dubs. Just not sure what happens on the other shows",

Unlike some other shows with age-regressed characters they don't show him struggling with his artificially immatured mind (at least in the show). And at that point in the story I don't think you can even give him the \"raging hormones\" excuse (he's 10). It's pretty bad, even by anime standards. \n\nThe earlier sex-pest stuff is definitely done for laughs, or, like the thing with the elf girl, is a total misunderstanding.\n\nStill a great show/story, but MC is definitely a creep (like you said, he does get better though, even during the show's brief run so far), and that's a hurdle plenty of viewers won't be able to get past, and I certainly wouldn't fault them.",

I think it's fairly well known by those into anime.

            "comment": "I think what constitutes as \"not getting enough love\" depends on the individual perceptions to begin with, but since Ranking of Kings and Made in Abyss have been mentioned, I'll assume a loose interpretation. This season I'm watching more seasonals than I usually do, and shows like Rokudo's Bad Girls and The Marginal Service I think aren't getting the love they deserve, but I've only seen one episode. On the other hand, Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation might be the best isekai I'll ever see, but I think it has the love that it deserves. These are the six shows I saw in the last two years that I feel are either underrated or are great shows that should be considered classics.\n\nFirst up is **Attack on Titan: The Final Season**. Now I know what you're thinking, \"that's not underrated\". And it's not. But my expectations for this show were in the DIRT. I did not like seasons 2 &amp; 3, I thought they were boring as hell. I watched this hoping to laugh at it but once Eren attacked Marley I became hooked in a way that I had never been hooked since the first season. I think the stuff with Eren in this \"Final Season\" is the best stuff in Attack on Titan, bar none. Underrated? Absolutely not. But exceeded my expectations more than the next five shows.\n\nI still don't get what people have against **Back Arrow**. It's a dumb meathead mecha western anime that we need more of in our daily lives. All of the characters are very memorable for one reason or another, from the main antagonist fueled by wine to the mysterious strategist Shu Bi, and of course the henchman with his own choir. It's the only anime that's released in the last two years that I've seen all the way through twice. I'm so glad it has a dub.\n\nI'll admit, **Sonny Boy** needs a rewatch before I can really gauge its greatness. I knew I liked it at first, but I didn't get how much I liked it until the last couple of episodes, which is when it really became amazing. It's never going to be a popular show, and that's fine, but as far as exceeding expectations go Sonny Boy certainly did that.\n\n**To Your Eternity** is without a shadow of a doubt my favorite anime of the new decade. Two seasons in, with a third on the way, and it hasn't slowed down, hasn't gotten boring, hasn't stopped introducing new ideas, hasn't stopped evolving, hasn't stopped getting me emotional, and it's still the best anime about death and how we all react to it. One aspect I'm shocked nobody talks about: the score. The music in To Your Eternity is some of the best I've heard in anime, particularly [Stars at Dawn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEfamEyvYY). That alone I feel deserves more love. To Your Eternity's current stigma of \"it peaked at the first episode\" is one that I think undersells what the series is going for. I can talk forever about this show and I probably will once it ends.\n\nThe only show on this list older than 2020 that I'll be talking about is **s-CRY-ed**. Despite a run on Adult Swim at the same time Paranoia Agent and Samurai Champloo were airing, s-CRY-ed has gone very under the radar. But the series has become a new all-time favorite for me. It's dumb as a box of rocks and that's why I love it so much. Some of the most fun I've had watching an anime, the story goes in all sorts of directions, the characters are wild and colorful, the music is sooooo good (the OP is one of my favorite OPs as well). Goro Taniguchi might be one of the most underappreciated anime directors considering the only thing he's gotten deserved praise for is Code Geass.\n\nThe last show I'll talk about is **Super HxEros**. I've brought this up in this subreddit before so I won't stay on this long. As far as ecchi action shows go, yeah this is way better than I could have possibly expected it to be. You might've noticed a running theme at this point that I'm willing to give a show credit for being dumb and stupid if it's supposed to be dumb and stupid and excels at being fun. Super HxEros meets this criteria. I'm not sure what you could be looking for in an ecchi that Super HxEros doesn't provide in spades. I mean, the tits are great and they're in service to an insane action-comedy. As far as ecchi go, this is a cut above the rest.",

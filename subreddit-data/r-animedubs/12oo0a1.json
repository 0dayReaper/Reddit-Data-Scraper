Square Enix M&amp;B, the manga's publisher, gives it an All Ages rating. If this series does get a physical release, I would expect a TV-G or TV-PG, with the latter seeming more likely to me.",

They\u2019re endearing. Their contrasting personalities make them so much fun to watch. And the adorable faces too. Maybe im getting a hint of Violet Parr from The Incredibles with Nishimura. Or any other bullied emo character you can think of. \n\nI love Takada\u2019s energy. And I can hear that Maddie Morris is having a blast each session. Plus, i love hearing Molly Zhang as Nishimura. \n\nI think the one thing that bothers me is the constant bullying to Nishimura. Words can hurt. The \u201csticks and stones\u201d phrase can only help so much. Im really hoping that each ep more and more of Nishimura\u2019s classmates can be friends with her.",

If not dubbed it just plays the sub version. They are all just listed by season if multiple. If not it just list all episodes currently released.",

It's just that those kind of characters can be a little aggravating sometimes to me. It's also a little weird that the girl is getting bullied by everybody, and the direction they are going is that Takada is just na\u00efve and doesn't recognize what is happening and it seems like he never will? Which is a sort of weird take on bullying to me. That she just needs a friend to \"get her out of her shell\" and it'll fix everything. I get that there will probably be more to it, and I'm interested in seeing how it goes, but just my two cents of what kind of worries me. I'm probably overthinking it, but bullying stories always make me a little apprehensive about how they go about it.",

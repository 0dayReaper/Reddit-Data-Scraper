I feel it's a genuinely fun, humorous, and sometimes heartwrenching anime. It has a few problems here and there, and its lack of an ending can leave the final episode feeling kinda half baked, but the show itself is a joy to watch, even with its occasional dabbling into typical idol tropes. I find it to be better than some really popular idol anime like Love Live (Real time: I hate Love Live) and, as of recently, 22/7 (That anime had a LOT of writing issues).",

For Tokyo revengers there were some weeks that the english dub did not drop so I thought that it was going to wait to be in sync with the US schedule. But it seems that now things are back again to weekly releases. \n\nThe same thing is happening for Heavenly Delusion right now, dub episodes drop on wednesdays here in Europe but this week only the spanish and portuguese dubs dropped. \n\nI'm very confused on how Disney+ handles their dubs honestly. It wouldn't hurt if they released an schedule or something.",

Just to give you a piece of my knowledge, I've only said it because when I saw Alexis Tipton being cast as Pascal, it reminded me of how since it was common for Funimation voice actors to replace the original ones instead doing role reprisals, like Mob Psycho, Northern War, Danganronpa, Scarlet Nexus, or Ace Attorney, it's my assumption that a Funimation actor had replaced the original actor for Pascal for the reason that \"it didn't worked out\". And it wasn't the first time Alexis replaced the original actor for her roles. If Akira Kamiya's salary can be compared to a union actor's status, then that's how he would feel when his role of Kogoro Mouri was taken by Rikiya Koyama while other veterans are happy reprise their roles for decades.\n\nIf a middle-aged man can voice a girl dressed in red yet a middle-aged man can't voice a Mexican-Japanese man, then why not replace Alexis Tipton with a female-sounding robot and make the rest of the cast robots too since robots are considered a race by this world's standards? \u201cRepresentation matters\u201d after all.",

Most new titles to be dubbed will have Texas-based casts going forward.\n\n&gt;At this point CR might as well acknowledge the union and form an agreement already. Money be damned.\n\nWhile unionization sounds promising, keep in mind that doing so would negatively affect their TX talent pool, many of them are still either resistant or silent about it. Making remote casting and recording the norm again like during the height of covid may be safe and more convenient, but it would mean the newly built in-house recording studio at the Coppell area would be for nothing, and some of the TX VA pool might worry that the outside talent would be favored over them thanks to remote recording, so CR maybe had a reason to enforce their in-person only dubbing policy when the merger took effect.",

To the Swordsmith Village being dubbed just before the season premiere really doesn't mean anything. Knowing how Aniplex of America has handled the dub in the past, the Swordsmith Village arc probably won't get dubbed until after the sub is completely over. They might simuldub it after the first 6-8 episodes are out in sub, but I'm not holding my breath for that.",

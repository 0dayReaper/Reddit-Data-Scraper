Not that I\u2019m complaining, I never not enjoy her work.\n\nSurprised Reali\u2019s parents were so cool with dropping the engagement but I quite liked their explanation. Also enjoyed Rinko acknowledging that she took the real Raeli\u2019s place and showing melancholy for it, a surprising take that most Isekai\u2019s don\u2019t cover or take stock in. The whole replacing someone else.\n\nThe big reveal about the seal tells me there is more the mystery than just this and I like the political intrigue that\u2019s being delved into. I\u2019m curious to see if Raeli accounts for any major changes she makes to the novels plot and how those changes derail events.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t like chocolate covered almonds?",

Only other instance I can think of is Ascendance of a Bookworm, with our MC replacing Myne being quite a big thread particularly in the first season. Though an important difference there I suppose is that our Myne quickly comes to see the OG Myne's family as her own, which does help with any guilt. Still though, it's a nice take to see, hopefully it gets explored a little more. \n\nA shame I missed the premier last week, but I have definitely enjoyed these first two episodes much more than I thought! From the description, title, and art, I kind of thought it would basically just be another reverse-harem isekai like All Routes Lead to Doom and I'm the Villainess. Though I suppose the former is technically a bi-harem, and this show does have a bit more in common with the latter (with both main heroines being clever schemers and all). Regardless, I'm glad I gave it a shot, I think it promises to be a very interesting show!",

I guess by the end they're both very serious, though. \n\nAlso, chocolate covered peanuts are definitely inferior to almonds, but chocolate covered pecans are better.",

At the time, I hardly even recognized it was her because I was introduced to her work through her more cutesy roles, too. I thought she did amazing there, even if the show didn\u2019t wind up being my cup of tea in the end.",

I hope that the bulk of it is good, really. The girls were great characters in the show, but God Futaro made it a very difficult trip to the end. I liking him to Nagi from A Couple of Cuckoos.\n\nOf course this is just my point of view, but I put them equal to each other and they definitely lessened my level of enjoyment of both shows.",

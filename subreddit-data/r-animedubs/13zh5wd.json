They just sound so awkward to me. Not just this show but all of them. I prefer dubs as a whole over subs but this always bugs me lol.\n\nI understand not trying to idk white wash the culture or do justice to the source materials, but it just sounds so out of place.\n\nYet things like Uzaki-chan that sub senpai for senior in that use and manner are equally out of place.",

No, just no. That's way too on the nose. What were they thinking?\n\nI remember season 1 of Kakegurui having this weird problem where Itsuki was literally *the only* character who kept using honorifics (I think it was only Senpai) in the dub. Thankfully they dropped this in season 2.\n\nIt becomes an even bigger problem with Sentai's dubs, in which they have scripts that are too literal. Dubs such as Dusk Maiden of Amnesia and Call of the Night suffer a lot when they constantly use honorifics.",

There is just something oddly respectful towards other people when using honorifics. I have actually used them in conversation when I was studying Japanese back in High School and College and it just felt right\u2026 don\u2019t ask me to say anything in Japanese because I was terrible at it, terrible at learning languages in general, and have forgotten everything I\u2019ve learned in the 20 years since.",

But I also get that there isn't really a 1:1 translation for the honorifics either (Miss/Mister Lord/Lady etc doesn't quite cut it but it's the closest we got in the English language) so I think that's why certain shows will either make the decision to keep it or not keep it, but even then, it can just sound odd in the English language versus hearing it in Japanese.\n\nI hope that made sense lol",

Seems like titles are often used, like \"president\" or \"officer\" or similar to try to reproduce it.",

Now you normally only get then if they form part of a specific nickname or don't have an elegant English equivalent, such as 'sempai'. \n\nFan dubs still cling to them though. But then again, thru also leave in other random Japanese words with perfectly viable English translations.",

To me that was ok, did not sound forced and was used to identify to the audience she was Japanese in origin, however the other stuff he did to confirm it did indicate that in the Japanese version it would not have been enough, I assume because since it\u2019s Japanese they are speaking the honorific would have been used by multiple characters.  I don\u2019t hear honorifics used in the dubs very often though.",

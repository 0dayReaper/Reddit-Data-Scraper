    "postText": "\n_Because of his wound from the cursed arrow fired by Matoba Seiji, Madara spends most of his time sleeping to fully heal. Without Master to protect him, Natsume has to remain constantly on guard. Especially since a strange stone seems to stir strange phenomena everywhere around him. To make things worse, it's the cultural festival and Natsume is appointed to serve the clients at the bazaar set by his class. But the pressure of keeping secrets from his best friends is causing Natsume to gradually break, which the rock yokai takes advantage of._",

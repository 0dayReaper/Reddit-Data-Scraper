Speaking of which, I'm more or less used to this kind to schedule since it was the norm for Funimation back in 2020-2021.\n\n&gt; Disney+ didn't OFFICIALLY announce it\n\nWho needs a so-called \"official announcement\" when you KNOW that a dub is pretty much inevitable? Also, in case you missed it...\nhttps://twitter.com/thereubeh/status/1644473208488472576 \n\n&gt; Title, metrics, et cetera\n\nTrivial things like that don't really matter. And it's not like this is first time a streaming service used the Japanese title rather than the English one. Aharen-san wa Hakarenai comes to mind...\n\n&gt; You have to be very patient\n\nAs in have you to wait for 3-8 months if you want your favorite Sentai-licensed seasonal anime to get dubbed. Heck, some of them are not even guaranteed to get dubbed... even for the eventual home video release. They'd rather redub Netflix anime than dubbing more of their sub-only catalogue. \n\n&gt; Sentai actually announces what gets dubbed\n\nThat's a not much of a defence either since unlike Sentai, Disney dubs 90% of the stuff they license. Sentai on the other hand only dubs 40%-50% of their licenses and locks the rest in the sub-only jail. And don't even get me started with the stunt they pulled with Tokyo Mew Mew New. \n\n&gt; say when it gets dubbed\n\nWhen are the dubs for Oshi no Ko and that generic farming isekai anime coming out again?",

Why else would you try so hard to defend them while trying to nitpick the hell out of Disney+ at the same time? It's obvious you're trying to make a mountain out of a molehill with your stulid nitpicks while mostly handwaving Sentai/Hidive's faults. \n\n&gt;almost certainly will be dubbed beginning of next season, possibly next season\n\nYour random guesses and speculations don't change the fact that Sentai didn't announce a date which you claimed they always do. \n\n&gt; I\u2019m incredibly frustrated with Disney. Announcing things and establishing a consistent strategy is important because I want to have an idea of when something will be dubbed. \n\nThat sounds more like a personal issue since most people are able to keep up just fine. And newsflash... Announcements/teasing are not important, the actual content is. Imagine teasing a dub for a show for months, only to do a bare-bones sub-only release for that show. \n\n&gt; \u201c90%\u201d being dubbed doesn\u2019t mean anything when they only ever stream a couple shows at most, if any at all, in a given season. Crunchy, HIDIVE, hell even Netflix. You can figure out how they generally do things fairly quickly. Not Disney, not at all\n\nSeems to me you only care about trying to \"figure out\" licenseing companies than the content they offer. And of course Disney's 90% dub ratio doesn't mean anything and Sentai's 50% dub ratio means everything to you.\n\nNot gonna even bother reading the rest of the post cause it's most likely more made-up nonsense about Sentai/HIDIVE being \"good\" and Disney+ being \"bad\".",

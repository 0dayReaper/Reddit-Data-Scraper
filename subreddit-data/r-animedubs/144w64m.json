I\u2019ll post every so often asking for highlights of a particular VA and I would love to hear what role you think their best work is :) Simple discussion, no wrong answers.\n\nTo start things off, I wanted to start with one of my favs: Tia Ballard. You may know her as Happy from Fairy Tail, Itsuke in Quintuplets, Yue in Arifureta, Chiho in Devil is a Part-Timer, Tsubame in Love is War, Nene in Toilet-bound Hanako-kun, or many MANY other roles. What role of hers is your favorite and why? :) If there are multiple favorites, please explain why.",

Her Yoshinon lines are a lot more dynamic and require much more skill to execute, and since Yoshinon is considered a separate character in the DAL universe, even if it is just for the sake of Yoshino's feelings, I believe that Yoshinon is her best role",

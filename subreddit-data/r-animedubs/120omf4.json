Old or new, as long as it's dubbed we'd like to hear about it. \n\nAnything good we should look out for? Anything bad we should try to avoid? Tell us a little bit of what you think. It's nice if you elaborate a bit on what it is you like or don't like about a show. That way your comment is useful to people who are looking for new anime to watch. :)\n\nWriting the names of the anime in **bold** is nice, to make it easier for people skimming the thread to pick out the names.\n\nSince this is also for people who are looking for new shows to watch, please use the spoilertag if you reveal any mayor plot points of the anime you are discussing (see spoilertag section in the sidebar for info on how).\n\n\nTo prevent low effort comments to steal the spotlight from people who put in a little bit more effort **top level comments in this thread must be at least 150 characters long** (roughly 3 sentences long).\n\n\n[You can find a list of the previous \"Your week in anime dubs\" posts here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/search/?q=author%3AAutoModerator+AND+title%3AYour+week+in+anime+dubs&amp;sort=new)",

The random F bombs are so well placed. \n\nMHA was an emotional roller coaster thus far and the dub solidified that. \n\nEminence in Shadow has been solid. \n\nThese are my standouts this season/week.",

            "comment": "Having watched the rest of ***Romantic Killer***, I warmed up to the series a bit more overall. The comedic and art style still didn't do it any favors in my opinion, but the anime managed to get me quite invested in its story despite that. I especially liked how the last 1.5 episodes focused on Kazuki's backstory and Anzu's relationship with him. I'd probably watch a 2nd season if we got one.\n\nAfter that, I did a rewatch of ***Daimidaler: Prince v.s. Penguin Empire***. Boy, I didn't quite remember just how blatant the ecchi in this show really is; it rarely goes 5 minutes without showing a pair of naked boobs. But the comedy, particularly the dub script, is excellent. My favorite part of the series is the 2nd set of protagonists, the overly lovey-dovey couple. Give me more saccharine PDA, please!\n\nAnd now, I'm on another rewatch of ***Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions!***, which makes it my 8th time through the series. My #1 anime of all time \u2013 I can never grow tired of it. It's such a heartfelt story with a superb baby-steps romance and amazing comedy.",

            "comment": "I'm 10/24 eps into my 2nd viewing of **Shirobako** . Still continues to be one of my top 5 favorite sentai dubs. And having a greater appreciation for the process of making anime. Def think it's a show that every anime fan should watch at least once in their lives, sub or dub.\n\n5 eps into **Tokyo Ravens**, per my twin bro's choice of our next daily show. So far, it's not hitting any thing for me, I guess this kind of magical/supernatural yokai stuff may not be my cup of tea unless it really hits. But gonna keep an open mind with it.\n\nBinged through the first 8 eps of S2 of **Vinaland Saga** on Netflix after jumping ship from the CR dub. I think they're both really good. Some VAs I prefer over the other. But it's been a very solid season.\n\nI'm one ep away from finishing the dub of **Babylon**. Personally, while I'm not really affected at this current moment by the main themes and arguments about the show, I do know it's a very sensitive topic. One that I feel that is much better discussed outside of this post. But I will say that it's a pretty solid dub. I think everyone does an okay to a good job with their roles. But David Matranga and Maggie Flecknoe are the two standouts for me. Especially with Ep 7, def enjoyed hearing David's character be pushed past his emotional breaking point, and hearing Maggie play a alluring psycho.\n\nLastly, I'm rewatching **Diary of our Days at the Breakwater** for a 3rd time, just finished the halfway point. I can't say it enough, if you love the dub of Laid Back Camp, I strongly urge you to give this CGDCT Fishing anime a try. It'll def give you the anime food/sashimi cravings. And the dub is just so precious. Been on a seafood craze this past week. So it's a wonderful complement. Plus, with it being spring, and summer coming up soon, it's a perfect show to watch during this time.",

It\u2019s about a social experiment where a group of kids are given the ability to feel the pain that the other kids experience. It\u2019s a heartfelt story that is definitely worth watching 12 episodes for.\n\nMy Hero Academia: I love this show, especially the current season. There is so much exciting superhero action, plot and character development, and excellent voice work that I look forward to every week. On a side note I saw Ant Man 3 in theaters a few weeks ago and I thought it was surprisingly terrible as someone who has always enjoyed superheroes. It reinforced why I\u2019ve gone from not watching (and knowing nothing about) anime a year ago to starting to get obsessed with it now. The writing just feels cleaner than a lot of other stuff out there.\n\nHunter X Hunter: I\u2019ve been working on this show for more than 2 months now and it\u2019s an enjoyable watch, although not the best anime to me. Each season has a completely different adventure and it\u2019s very hard to predict where the story is headed. Like I\u2019m in the middle of season 5 now and I never would have guessed that it would be about &gt;!man eating human-ant hybrids trying to take over the world!&lt; but it\u2019s cool. I find the main character annoying because he places his pride above logical decision making, yet gets away with it because he\u2019s the main character. The acting in the dub is good, although it is a little weird how many male characters are played by females. Kurapika especially sounds too much like a girl.",

The story evolves into a whole conspiracy and the ending\u2026omg the ending. You\u2019ll have to watch, it\u2019s worth it! \n\n**Tactics** Currently watching this, another exorcist anime. Just at episode 7/25 right now, but enjoying it. I really enjoy the Japanese mythology, youkai, type stuff and this is scratching that itch!

I liked Konosuba a lot but I'm pretty sure that's required by law.\n\nI'm usually a romcom watcher, but in looking for something new to watch, I found good things about Re:Zero. Despite my aversion to isekai I figured I'd give it a try.\n\nLook at that! It's cute! The MC is trope aware! He's damn likeable at that. Okay, I'm into this.\n\nSpoilers: &gt;!It's horror. It's a freaking brilliant horror anime disguised in sugar sweet coating. I have not felt dread like I do watching this show in a long time. Weirdly, I get big Attack on Titan vibes from it.!&lt;\n\nI'm only about halfway through the first season, so please no spoilers.

Tsukasa got some really great character development, and as of ep 4/5, I'm totally on board with their adorable relationship now. I loved her passionate rant in [ep5] &gt;!about movies, even including a Star Wars reference (and a hilarious Avatar one with recolored aliens who were so obviously the Navi), and I totally agree with her that awesome movies are still awesome even on a cheap TV.!&lt; Of course, just when I was getting invested, I had to put it on hold.\n\n**Millionaire Detective: Balance Unlimited** - The free anime I picked on Funimation. It's a fun action/comedy I started mainly to fill the void left by Buddy Daddies, and interestingly, Kato reminds me quite a bit of Kazuki. The story so far is getting better as it goes along. I could only watch the first two episodes in dub, but I think I actually prefer Daisuke's voice in the sub.\n\nTechnically anime-inspired rather than anime, but I've also started rewatching **Legend of Korra**. The first season is my favorite, so seeing it again is fun. It's been a while since I did a full series rewatch.",

I did find it interesting that in the last episode (minor spoilers but not naming names) &gt;!a character from the game!&lt; shows up and you get to hear a difference between two different voice acting styles.\n\nI would still put **Gurren Lagann** and **Kill la Kill** above it in terms of my favorites by Imaishi's teams, both of which also have legendary dubs. The middle does drag a bit, though it remains consistently interesting throughout. If you want blood an action on the scale of something like **Doom: Eternal** but with an a real story then it's literally made for you.\n\n**Made in Abyss** \\- I don't love this dub, but I chose to put up with it because I wanted to spend more time looking at it than reading. Instant favorite. Absolutely beautiful. Holding off on diving right into the movie and Season 2, I need a breather after that ending. I think in terms of dubs it's got too weird of pacing to work properly in English, plus some not fully developed voices.\n\nI am also watching **Kaiji** but I did not like what I heard of the dub so I've skipped to sub.",

Like theres sound mixing issues?\n\n Also Colleen has KILLED it as Luffy forever but the 4th gear moment the way she did the voice was weird and confusing..??\n\nMy question is was this when covid came and screwed voice acting/sound recording up? Is that why this arc is bit of a downgrade with sound recording/mixing/directing compared to the past?",

So that\u2019s season 3 wrapped up.\n\nSeason 4 will be the Hashira training arc as well as the beginning of the Infinity Fortress arc (easily 13-16 episodes especially with the flashbacks).\n\nFinal season will be the second half of the infinity fortress arc as well as the countdown to sunrise arc (13-16 episodes).\n\nSo yeah, minimum of three 1-cour seasons, or two 2-cour seasons and a movie.",

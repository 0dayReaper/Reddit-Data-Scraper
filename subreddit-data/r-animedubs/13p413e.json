It did a great job of showing how powerful both are. \n\nTakumi blushing was adorable.\n\n\u201cThe Shop, We Do Things!\u201d \u201cLook Polka,I got picked up at a Bar!\u201d I love the humor of this series.\n\nStill not fond of Bree\u2019s portrayal of Misaki. But I\u2019ve gotten used to it.\n\nThe story kicks into gear from this point so enjoy the ride folks",

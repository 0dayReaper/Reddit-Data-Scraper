It\u2019s good that HiDive/Sentai are licensing popular or big anime but part of me is scared for how the dub is gonna turn out, if they dub it, due to the fact that Sentai dubs can be hit or miss. We\u2019ll see what happens.",

It doesn\u2019t help that most of the time, Sentai\u2019s dub scripts are usually just the subtitles with minor tweaks to account for lip flaps, where as with CR dubs, they usually take a lot more liberties to make their dub scripts more natural sounding. Sentai\u2019s casting and direction are definitely an issue, especially with Oshi no Ko. I kinda don\u2019t know what made them think casting newer or lesser known VAs would be a good idea. I\u2019m not really against it but because the direction is lacking, that\u2019s really a problem.",

Like for example madden has gotten worse barely changes.  Because no one else allowed to make a nfl game now  . Anime for Netflix and Disney is cherry on top  while for hidive and cruchyroll it\u2019s the cake . basically  competition is good",

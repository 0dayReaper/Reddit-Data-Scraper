Unfortunately, between his mother\u2019s hospital bills, his sister\u2019s tuition, and his own lack of job prospects, he has no choice but to continue to put his life on the line. So when an opportunity arises for a bigger payout, he takes it\u2026only to come face-to-face with a being whose power outranks anything he\u2019s ever seen! With the party leader missing an arm and the only healer a quivering mess, can Jinwoo some\u00adhow find them a way out?\n\n[Source](https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2023/03/21-2/solo-leveling-anime-premieres-next-winter)",

I got hella lucky when I found the first 5 volumes at my local Meijer of all places haha.",

Also can\u2019t tell who his VA is but I liked him here.\n\nI love the robots are all lewd and/or horny. It\u2019s delightful.\n\nWhen they started talking about the robot armor, I chuckled to myself that if only Jesse was still voicing Touya you could have made a joke about Infinite Stratos and Ichika.\n\nAlso Bryson may not be the Harem King but he definitely is now the Harem Prince with this, MonMusu and Danmachi.",

Plus while we definitely saw Touya approach Ende at the end of the series, we never really saw them interact beyond that. It implied he was also from Earth, but now it's a mystery.",

Personally, my favorite role he has been in is the Narrator for Kaguya-sama: Love is War. Absolutely unhinged, hilarious, and just a great performance overall.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Which show do you think Mr. Sinclair absolutely killed in? Why that one? DISCUSS!",

Nakahara voice changes between dramatic and eccentric as he plays off of the fickle main character. Wen-li is him with a relaxed voice in a space opera. Einar is him adapting to a serious drama with barely any comedy.\n\nAll of these are fantastic, yet not his most popular ones.",

He manages to convey the exact right emotion/tone in every scene, despite voicing a pretty quiet and subdued character. His performance is amazing and fairly subtle compared to so many of his usual roles.\n\nAlso, if CR decides not to dub S4 (and subsequent seasons) for some reason I'm absolutely done with them. That's one of the best shows, and best dubs in recent years.",

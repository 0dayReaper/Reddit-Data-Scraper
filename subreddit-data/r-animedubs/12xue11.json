Netflix dub currently is two episodes behind in season two while also having seasone one fully dubbed. In other words as long as you stick to sentai/crunchyroll or netflix/netflix youre good voice consistency wise. Quality wise a lot of people here seem to simply watching dubs very casualy and judge them based on subjective preferance rather then objective tropes (nothing wrong with having an opinion) so if youre one of the chill guys its really up to you. If you like one cast over another then simply go for it no harms done but id highly recommend you watching sentai version over netflix/jp due to them having better written scrip lack of censorship not missing very basic and obvious flaps and genreally better background noise for soldiers grunting and that sort of stuff.",

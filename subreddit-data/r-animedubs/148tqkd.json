            "comment": "Crunchyroll servers have less bandwidth than YouTube.  That's the answer.  I also think the console version might not be optimized as well either considering even the interfaces get updated individually.  And you'll see individual apps going down for Crunchyroll and not just the whole server. \n\nThere will be times on PS5 for example it just does not work.  But it works fine on the website.",

I'm just saying that they shouldn't make such claims.\n\nAlso, those non canon movies are kinda meh. Why can't they take the Demon Slayer route, pick some smaller arc, and do a canon movie? Non canon movies always have the heroes meet new friends, learn new moves, and fight foes who are more powerful than current series foes. And then they kinds forget all of that, and act like it never happened.",

And they have the same flaw as all non-serial movies: they can not touch the status quo, and thus everything that happens in the movie, is forgotten about in the show. The manga is the canon, but since the author gets a nice slice of the profits pie, he will obviously say that ''yes yes, all of it is nice and canon''.",

The same way Naruto has 11 movies, but only 2 of them are canon, or both DB and One piece have a few dozen movies, that are not canon. Non-serial movies are just cash cows, that absolutely refuse to take risks, and focus only on some super safe storytelling and fanservice. Even better word to describe them, would be filler.",

He's also a big fanboy of Satan himself, calling him the world's first Quirkless Villain. He's extremely psychopathic and is prone to violent tantrums when his plans go awry. He lives in a factory while being served by a hoard of Bots he invented, each with their own appearance and personality (I'll give you the memo if you're interested). He wears black dictator clothing with an eyepatch obscuring his right eye; the results of a stray blast scarring him is so bad, you can see the *skull around the blind socket.* He also replaced his right leg with a prosthetic made of Tungstan metal. \n\nHis voice actors for both languages should be Takehito Koyasu (J) &amp; Todd Haberkorn (E).",

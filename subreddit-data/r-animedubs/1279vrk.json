Hope they give us a full cast and crew list, already took a quick listen and everyone is back so far (definitely wanna know who they got to replace Scott Freeman as Kagari though)\n\nDefinitely wonder if Crunchyroll will be able to pick up and dub the upcoming Providence film (which might be safe to watch since it appears to be a prequel to S3)",

It's nowhere near as compelling as the first season, it relies heavily on shock value (S1 could get pretty brutal but most of it progressed the story/character arcs), and it rehashed a lot of beats from season one in far less interesting ways. The animation has far more dips as well. It's not like S1 was stunningly animated but it was almost always pleasant to look at. Characters in S2 go off-model a lot more and some art direction choices are just...not great.\n\nIt's fine if you just love the franchise and the characters that much, and I can't deny that I had fun watching it in a popcorn-y way, but IMO the first season, the movie, and the Sinners trilogy are the only ones worth the watch. There are some good side stories and manga too. Season 3 was inoffensive, but *extremely* boring IMO.",

But I've watched the first two films and I can confirm that these characters have retained the same voice actors as in previous seasons.\n\n* Akane Tsunemori - Kate Oxley\n* Shinya Kogami - Robert McCollum\n* Mika Shimotsuki - Cherami Leigh\n* Nobuchika Ginoza - Josh Grelle\n* Sho Hinakawa - Z Charles Bolton\n* Teppei Sugo - Mike McFarland\n* Risa Aoyanagi - Colleen Clinkenbeard\n* Shion Karanomori - Lydia Mackay\n* Dominator - Stephanie Young\n\nI'm not really sure about Yayoi Kunizuka, I think she may still be voiced by Lindsay Seidel. Same with Shougo Makishima.\n\nAlso, I'm not 100% sure, but I'm pretty sure Kagari's new voice actor is Kyle Igneczi who voices Axel in Fairy Gone.",

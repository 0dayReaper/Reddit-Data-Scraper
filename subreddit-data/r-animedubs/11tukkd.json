    "postText": "Have any of you have read Oshi No Ko ? Since Sentai/HIDIVE end up licensed this anime, i hope that Sentai will going Dub this one due to the popularity of the manga. But i was worried that recently, it seems that Sentai never dub any anime that was PURE romcom, shoujo, and slice of life\n\nSo, Who Would You Want To cast in the English Dub of Oshi No Ko ? For me, I could See Juliet Simmons  will the english dub cast of Ai Hoshino, or maybe Amalee ( I wish she appear in more Sentai dub )",

I could also see Scott Gibbs playing the doctor guy and Brittney Karbowski as Kana.",

The main problem I have is that their scripts are *very* literal and they can be a little stiff as a result, and a stiff script tends to impact the voice acting quite a bit. The range of cast and crew is much smaller than other localizers as well. Also, HiDive is...not great.\n\nOne thing I really appreciate about them is how they're usually really good about translating the OP/EDs and Japanese text, though. Crunchyroll is so blas\u00e9 about that, so it's nice to see the extra effort. Massive props for dubbing the songs in Akiba Maid War recently as well.",

I really hope Sentai doesn't let us down, they **must** dub this considering the hype and suspense.

The dub was one of the best I\u2019ve ever heard. \n\nI would say my favorite voices are Denji\u2019s and Power\u2019s since they fit the character\u2019s chaotic personalities. The actors did super well, especially in the comedic scenes. \n\nI really like all the voices though.",

Absolutely love every role she plays in the shows ive seen her in, but this role is on another level and she captures Power perfectly. \n\nMakima - Suzie Yeung does a great job of sounding ominous and terrifying but in a subtle way thats hard to describe. Much more so than sub version imo.",

She def uses a voice and inflection that I don't hear too often from her. And she was amazing.\n\nFinally, Reagan Murdock would steal the scene with his dark and dramatic takes on Aki when shit goes real down hill.",

            "comment": "A new visual for **SPY x FAMILY**, coming to Crunchyroll this April!\n\nThere's a lot of deserved hype behind the show, so hopefully Crunchyroll (or Funi) dubs it early. I have no doubt it'll be dubbed.\n\nSynopsis:\n\n&gt;Agent Twilight, the greatest spy for the nation of Westalis, has to infiltrate an elite private school. In order to do so he assumes the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, adopts an orphan girl, and marries a city hall employee. Unknown to him, his daughter Anya is a telepath and his wife Yor is an assassin. The three learn to become a family while working to complete Twilight's missions and maintain world peace.\n\n[Source](https://twitter.com/spyfamily_anime/status/1500486358581723141)",

Since dub eps will always come out after sub, you can always switch to sub if you don\u2019t like the English voices. In the Crunchyroll trailers, the characters sound cool in Japanese as well, so I\u2019d say just try out dub for an ep or two, and then decide.",

I do love a good underdog feel to it (Or in this case, underpig). Bless Nagomi for going all out on making the Oinky Doink stall stand out and do well, despite the ire of the fellow creatureland maids. \n\nI know Oinky Doink has been put through hell all season. I wouldnt be surprised if the other creatures treat their trash better than they do the pigs. But you provoke a pig long enough, they gonna fight back. And it felt so good to see the girls fight their way to the top, shock the system, and potentially earn more customers. \n\nLast two things, Manager bails all day, shows up last minute, team wins, \u201cyep, i did that, those are MY girls\u201d! And finally, RIP Debt Collector, someone had to take the fall, it unfortunately had to be you.",

However, for the 99th sacrifice, the human girl brought to the capital, Sariphi, intrigues the Beast King.*  \n*In fact, she isn't afraid of him or any other beast and even accepts her death without begging or crying, as she has neither home nor family to return to if she were released. The King finds her intriguing and let her stay at his side as his consort despite being human. This is the story of how Sariphi will become the queen of demons and beasts.*",

Though, I almost spat out my water when I saw Bennu with the derpy face and, as Jonathan Rigg calls it: Danny DeVito voice. \n\nI like the paralells between Bennu and Sari: Both are small and frail, compared to the beasts. And are underestimated. But only the ones that truly see their potential know that they'll soon soar. Hopefully Sari will in time as well.",

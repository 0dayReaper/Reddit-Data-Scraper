It's clear that the trade federation is all about moving money, and marketing campaigns which makes sense for obvious reasons.\n\nSo why wouldn't the admin ai be a colorful cheerful personality? It fulfills its role efficiently, and matches the trade federations \"friendly\" aesthetic.",

I never really use those settings on my TV (except for sports), but occasionally if a show looks a bit choppy I'll set it to some of the lowest settings. I don't really get the soap opera effect feeling like I do with live action or normal anime.\n\nOn the flip side. If you have your soap opera effect settings turned on by default, it can compensate a lot (too much) for lower frame rate stuff, and can be a bit disorienting. In that case turn it off or down some.",

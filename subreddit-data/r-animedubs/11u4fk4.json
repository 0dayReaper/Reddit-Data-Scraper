            "comment": "\"JACK FELL DOWN AND BROKE HIS CROWN!\" \\~ Oh my sides. Somoeone tell Ms. Anna that daycare is supposed to be a place for fostering kids' imagination, excitement, and curiosity. Not traumatize them via nursery rhymes.\n\nReally enjoyed the Rei focused ep. I don't think either Rei nor Kazuki have been involved in any kind of deadly business since ep 2.\n\nI guess without going on a long tirade about it, to answer Rei's question, change is a product of you and the environment and people around you. Miri fell into their lives, and it's turned it 180. Def made Rei care for someone else. And I bet the old Papa Rei would've easily pulled the trigger on his old mentor instead of hesitating.\n\nI think if he's worried about how he, an assassin, can feel worthy for Miri to call him Papa and make him believe it, that will probably come in time. I mean, i'm more than sure it took Yor Forger more than a single ep before she finally accepted the fact she was Anya's mama, even though there were some doubts and bumps along the way. It's a personal thing for him, but I'm sure Rei will have that feeling of validation, if that's what he's seeking.",

            "comment": "I've been waiting to find out more about Rei's past after those quick flashbacks in a previous episode. As I expected, his father turned out to be the head of a criminal organization (I figured that when the guy made his own son call him \"boss\"), but I'm still a little uncertain about his ties to Kyu and if his organization is the same one supplying their missions. That ending was ominous though. \n\nRei wonders if it's possible for him to change after growing up like that, and I hope he'll realize that he already has started to change after living with Kazuki and Miri. At first, he didn't even want her to call him \"papa\", but he later embraced that role and even spent the last episode caring for her when she was sick, falling asleep at her bedside while holding her hand. He is changing for the better, and it may seem like a slow build up at first, but someday he might notice it all at once.\n\nThe birthday surprise was so sweet, and Miri succeeded in getting Rei to smile for a *second* time (the first being when she went on about how great her Papa Rei is during the zoo trip) but it's too bad she didn't get to see it! I really hope they woke her up to eat because that food looked delicious. And Miri continues to show that she's a very perceptive kid with her comments about Rei and her mom.",

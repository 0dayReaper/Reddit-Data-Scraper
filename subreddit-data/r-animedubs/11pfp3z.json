    "postText": "So, I've just recently learned that a few of the *K-On!* songs were actually dubbed in English for the blu-ray release (There's a [video of Fuwa Fuwa Time](https://www.reddit.com/r/k_on/comments/vluu3s/kon_fuwa_fuwa_time_english_dub_official_from_the/) on the *K-On!* subreddit).\n\nProblem is: I own the ultimate collection on blu-ray, and I just ripped every track from the \"special features\" disc onto my hard drive. I can't find the English-dubbed songs anywhere.\n\nCan anyone confirm that the songs are on that disc? And if so, are they on it as separate videos or just as alternative audio tracks on the same videos as the Japanese audio?",

Sounds like that's the reason, then.\n\nIt's kind of crappy they didn't include it since the entire dub was done by Sentai, right? No idea if there were still legal issues of some kind or they just didn't care enough to put the dubbed songs on there. Oh well.",

I do wish this dub was credited better, the rest of the YoRHa and Resistance members sounded pretty familiar, especially Rose.\n\nShame we're only 2 eps away from catching up with Japan and there's still no news on when it's returning from the production hiatus.",

Exactly is what this dub is Once again, Thanks to Aniplex, This dub will be 2 cours, 24 episodes of absolute Casting Magic and Pure Awesomeness based on the Nier Video Game itself. Today's Episode was a Blast. \n\nReturning Back from the game to the Anime is Erica Lindbeck as Anemone. Okay now that we got her back there are only 3 characters from the game left to make their speaking appearances in the anime left. Eden Riegel to come back as Devola and Popola the twins. and I don't know if anyone had noticed but the Giant Machine named Simone also speaks and is played by Erin Fitzgerald. Correct me if I'm wrong on this?",

The plot can be easy to follow since it seems like the anime is trying to simplify it for the non-gamer audience.\n\nSince it hasn't finished then it could either keep on following the simple story or go full on rabbit hole level 9f Lore which might be too much for the new NieR crowd.\n\nIt has also adapted the plot of the stage play which is an odd choice since that also sets up for them to take stuff from the books too or even Replicant/Reincarnation.",

Easy to follow for now, hopefully it stays that way for people who haven't played the games (though you should).",

So many of the Netflix game adaptations (League of Legends, DOTA, etc) are so deep in the lore and stuff that as a person who didn't play those games I was lost and couldn't watch them.",

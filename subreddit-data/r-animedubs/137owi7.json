The movie should've focused on the main pairing but since the series had to leave it up in the air who he was gonna choose the movie had to give equal time to all the quints. Which it did not have time for at all. \n\n\nNot to mention fuutaro's confession felt straight out of a dating Sim and could've worked for most of the quints. Its bizarre since the rest of the series didn't feel like that.\n\n\nThe final pair makes sense but didn't feel right. For a love confession I dont want to say it makes sense in my head. I wanna I feel it in my heart (cheesy af I know sue me), which I didn't with this series.",

Yotsuba was one of them.  And, he chooses her.  Ok then.   As for it being yotsuba who he met when he was younger.  (you know, this detail they just stuffed in last minute at the end of season 2) --- That could have literally have been any of them.  And as it turns out, he had met ALL OF THEM when he was younger.

It's basically him picking the girl + a bit after, then right to the wedding.

Your issue with the story is completely irrelevant to what the story is trying do/show, im not kidding go read a Romance Novel it\u2019s basically the same thing. A GOOD book has a Beginning-Middle-End, and it flows together beautifully and keeps the reader captivated the entire time and having the read to want to keep going! And this movie does that.",

Would be cool if they made a new season covering Fuutarou having a family of his own and seeing how that lifestyle looks. \n\nThere is so much that could be added if the creators wish to do so.\n\nThe anime Clannad went this route.",

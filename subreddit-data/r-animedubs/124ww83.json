He's still young and after about five years in is already looking to have a promising career in voice over. Ry knew he wanted to voice act pretty early on. He grew up watching anime and playing a lot of RPGs, and even looked up to many of the vets of the industry. Voice actors like Mike McFarland, Caitlin Glass, and J. Michael Tatum. Like some of his peers, he looked to the internet to get himself started into voice acting, starting out in fan projects until making the move to Texas where he's voiced in Sentai and CR anime dubs. \n\nHis voice has a distinct higher pitched, nasaly sound to it, which has netted him plenty of memorable roles. Which one has been your favorite so far?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Ry\u014dma Echizen** (Prince of Tennis): Love it when he says he says his catch phrase too. And I def feel that Howard Wang knew from the start that Ry was always gonna be Ryoma.\n\n\\- **Rito Y\u016bki** (To Love Ru): Say what you want about this wild and weird harem anime. But Ry as Rito very loud and very fun.\n\n\\- **Miya** (Sk8 the Infinity): Honestly, everyone in this cast is exceptional, Ry included. Miya is a lot of fun, and when i was watching, I wanted to adopt the little boy. He's so good.\n\n\\- **Belaf** (Made in Abyss: The Golden City of the Scorching Sun)",

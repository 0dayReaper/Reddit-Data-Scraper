Forcing people in contracts with money and wanting to kill a dragon to inflate your own image are not mistakes. They are deliberate immoral acts. The elf claimed that Yifa growing up around him makes her blind. Yet her growing up around the prince does not ok hypocrite.\n\nThat recruiting Young ladies felt lik a weird cult. It disgust me when people say you must use your massive talents to heck with what you want. They even treat falling in love as some less fulfilling failure in life. People have the right to live their life how they want if they do not hurt anyone.\n\nThe elf trying to force the contract was reprehensible. Then she tries to act friendly give me a break. I hope they do show up again unless they want to be if use with new threat",

    "postText": "I was kinda disappointed of Sentai decision of choosing dubs recently, it seems that it was clear that everything they license that wasn't get a DUBCAST, especially if the anime was a Slice of Life, Moe, Romance or Shojo always had no chance of getting an english dub in Home Media Release and they rarely go back and dub any sub-only anime like they used to.\n\nTo me it's fine for them to dub more action, fan service and Fantasy/isekai anime ( Even if some of them are generic), but there are plenty of other anime genres that deserve an English dub, maybe they could do that by hiring more staff, allows remote recording VA and outsourcing to another dub studio.\n\nSo does anyone have a suggestion what Sentai Filmwork's Anime that deserves an English Dub?\n\nJust in case, you could see the complete list of anime that was licensed by Sentai Filmworks [here in Myanimelist](https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks)",

            "comment": "Looking through Sentai's most popular anime, I am quite satisfied by the titles Sentai chooses to dub. Other than some popular CGDCT shows like *Non Non Biyori* or *Is the Order a Rabbit?*, which I rather Sentai not dub as their casting is hit or miss for those types of shows, Sentai's dub selection isn't missing major titles. Maybe it's not so much what they choose to dub but rather how long it takes to come out. For example, the Demon Girl Next Door dub came out so belatedly that I watched its dub as a refresher for the 2nd season (after having already watched the sub a few years prior). \n\nI am hoping Sentai will get around to dubbing this season's romance title *Dangers in My Heart*. *Call of the Night* got a belated dubcast announcement in its last month of airing, and I'm hoping the same will happen for *Dangers*.",

            "comment": "Even if I'm not inherently interested, I think it'd be nice if they went back and dubbed a few shows with more seasons that just never got one past the first, like Yuki Yuna is a Hero, Familiar of Zero, and even the Shirobako film; though I know movie licenses are more difficult.\n\nThey went back for **Himouto Umaru** so I guess it's not impossible, though Familiar of Zero is fairly old now, so that's probably more unlikely.\n\nAside from that... maybe **Triage X** even though it's old. I've read a chunk of the manga and it's just stupid ecchi fun.\n\nCould do **Is the Order A Rabbit?** since that one seems to be highly rated and regarded.\n\nThey haven't picked up much I've been interested in. Much as I love romcoms, the ones they have and didn't dub are largely standard fare and drawn out baiting.",

I don't know if I'm more bummed about this hidden gem of a show never getting dubbed or a second season never happening lol\u2026\n\nSentai also needs to re-license Another and dub the OVA, and I hope to god they dub Insomiacs After School.",

The show is simply magical, it's special in a way that I do *not* often use to describe anime.\n\nI wouldn't say \"no\" to a Dangers in my Heart dub, either.\n\nFor something older, a dub of Gi(a)rlish Number would be fun. A show *about* voice acting just seems like it would work well with smart localization and a cast who was really good at flipping between a performative voice and more natural tones. Also I desperately want to hear a bevy of [\"It's in the bag, GAHAHAHAHAHAHA\"](https://youtu.be/Nqps0MXYJFc) in English.\n\nJoshiraku *might* be fun. Yes, the show relies *heavily* on Japanese wordplay, but the official subs did a pretty solid job of translating the humor and keeping the spirit intact most of the time. I'm not going to beat down anyone's door to get this dubbed, but I'd easily welcome one.\n\nOh, and for a *spicy* choice, I want them to get the home license for Takagi season 2 and *re-dub it*. Yeah, I know people super-frowned-upon Sentai's redubbing of Netflix's Kakegurui, but Takagi has a legitimate case here. Funimation did an *exceptional* dub of season 1, then NoFucks poached the second season of the show and sent it off to ~~Bang Zoom,~~ VSI, who didn't bother making even the most token of gestures to bring the original cast back. Then NoFucks decided they were done with the series and the third season and film fell to Sentai which actually put in the effort to bring back as much of the Funi cast as possible, including Dismuke, who I'm pretty sure never worked for Sentai before. If Sentai would scoop up the BD license for season 2 and give us Wiedenheft &amp; Dismuke, then we could have consistent leads through the whole series.",

They had Bryson Baugus replace Aaron Dismuke in some episodes, then for whatever reason they kept Baugus as Nishikata in the movie (I was able to find the movie and its dub credits on the high seas). Like, I get that Dismuke had to be replaced for season 3 because he had to go on vocal rest at the time, but why they couldn't have just put the dub for the movie off for a while until Dismuke was ready to come back is completely beyond me.",

A show about voice acting just seems like it would work well with smart localization and a cast who was really good at flipping between a performative voice and more natural tones. Also I desperately want to hear a bevy of \"It's in the bag, GAHAHAHAHAHAHA\" in English.\n\nI could see David Wald as Namba ( the Gahahaha one )",

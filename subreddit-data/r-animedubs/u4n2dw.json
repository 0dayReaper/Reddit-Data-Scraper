The other VA's you mentioned particularly Saab and Connors are former DFW area residents before moving to LA a few years back.\n\nSo I wouldn't be surprised at all if non-TX talent would be required to fly to Dallas to record in person for in-house dubs, unless it's a returning/reprisal role.",

Despite i'm glad the dubbing works was return to normal phase, but I'm still concern about the actor's safety while working on studio, i wish that CR reconsider not to remove Remote recording and doing a hybrid method, where some VA from TX/Dallas dub from studio, while the other VA who outside of TX/LA still do remote recording not just for a sequel/new season but also for new original titles either its simuldub or for Bluray.\n\nI like remote recording, because not just about safety, but i also like to see both newcomer and popular/veteran talent dubbing an anime together while in different locations and make the dubbing talent pool keep expanding.",

Realistically it wouldn\u2019t really make any sense for CR to completely abandon the LA Studios like Studiopolis, Bang Zoom and NYAV Post entirely. Even though CR has their new studio, I doubt that they\u2019ll be able to produce 24+ Dubs in house. They are gonna have to outsource regardless. But I agree with you on the LA dubs be announced next month. Besides Science Fell in Love S2 and Shield Hero S2, what other shows from this season do you see being dubbed in LA. I feel like Tomodachi Game, Estab Life and The Greatest Demon Lord would be LA dubs, along with possibly Skeleton Knight. But we\u2019ll have to wait and see how things unfold.\n\n&gt; As for other outsourcing studios such as Sound Cadence, Kocha Sound and Studio Nano, CR will very likely hand over a show to each of them.

Of course for those shows that are originally on Crunchyroll, that have upcoming seasons, keeping the same cast is best, but when there are new characters appearing, well heck having someone new/different is good, being a new hire or someone who worked on Funimation shows.

It\u2019s already bad enough they are restricting their in house dubs to just Texas Talent but some of their VAs are getting vocal strain too? Hope Aaron Dismuke feels better soon.\n\nRealistically it wouldn\u2019t really make sense to build a in house recording studio in LA since they already have a new studio in Texas. I really do hope remote recording stays and that Crunchyroll doesn\u2019t do more harm than good.",

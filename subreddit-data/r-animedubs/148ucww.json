            "comment": "Real answer:\n\nYes, it does. Though they're not named and they're not as clear cut as shounen, which usually has a villain in the arc that must be defeated or a clear goal to accomplish. Fruits Basket is extremely linear and progressive and rather than telling a story in chunks it tells a consistent narrative, similar to Monster or FMA and FMA:B.\n\nHowever, if you boil it down, this is how a lot of fans have organized the show:\n\n1. Introduction to the zodiac members (nearly all of season one)\n2. Kyo's true form (last handful of episodes of season 1)\n3. Beach House Arc (definitely the most traditional \"arc\" in the series and one of the most popular, takes up most of the first half of season 2)\n4. Student Council Arc (takes place after the beach house, feels very lighthearted compared to that arc but still has a lot of depth and development, introduces the student council members)\n5. Rin's arc, which also explains a lot of Zodiac lore, backstory, and development for many characters. Season 2 episode 14-19).\n6. Cinderella-ish (last bunch of season 2 episodes, also provides a lot of development for many characters)\n7. Finale - The last season\n\nAgain, these aren't traditional arcs and you might be disappointed if your expecting Naruto-esque storytelling where the show is broken down into digestible chunks. The beauty of Fruba's narrative is how every episode consistently and carefully builds on its themes and concepts, before it all culminates into one massive payoff.",

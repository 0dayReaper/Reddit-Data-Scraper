            "comment": "And thus wraps probably my favorite winter 2023 anime that's not MHA.  I had the most fun with this one. I've watched it at least twice a day. Three if you include the sub version too. And I've enjoyed every ep of it. Def filled my Spy x Family craving, while the musical rush and flair of a James Bond movie as well. \n\nLoved how the finale was just a shootout just to get to Rei's boss. Call it cruel, call it poetic justice, call it irony: Ogino was all about collecting his targets' last words. And yet, when it came for his, he couldn't say a damn thing. \n\nI don't remember if any anime awards had \"Best Family\" in one of their categories, but consider the Buddy Dads fam one of my favorite. You know it's real love when they are willing to risk running into bullets, personally injure themselves, and still make Miri's Santa's wishlist come true. It just felt so good and heartwarming. \n\nI would wish for an S2, but I do think the credits scene with Miri grown up probably is a very fitting bookend to this fun show. Maybe an OVA where teen Miri brings home a boyfriend and the dads go full on over-the-top overprotective. But that's all I can think of. Even if we don't get anything else, this was a very fitting and happy end.\n\nProps to all involved. Shawn Gann (and Sara Ragsdale) directing the Sugar Daddy Friday ship, and also getting out some great performances from both shows. Ben Phillips for adapting the script and making it fun. Landon, David, and Emi really making Kazuki, Rei, and Miri just explode my heart with laughs, feels, and memes on a weekly.",

I'm surprised they never addressed that.",

Except for Ogino, but fuck that guy.\n\nI especially liked that we got an actual ending, but I guess that's a function of the show being an original story without needing to advertise light novels.\n\nShow was fun, Miri was adorable, and the gunplay they did have was actually pretty good.",

Miri in high school and how protective they were when she was a child now that shes of dating age. Q managing a Cinnabon in Omaha. I think there's still a lot to explore.",

This makes it so that 89% of the anime has been dubbed. \n\nOf course, there are the six recap specials that were aired over the last year that may make things a little weird. Even though they aren't numbered episodes, they were aired in place of episodes for certain weeks and Funamation and Crunchyroll both have them in between episodes on their app. It would be a big bummer if they are counted as episodes with dub releases and we get one or two of the recaps in a batch. Even worse would be if they are included in a DVD release and trying to binge the series on DVD results in a recap special.",

Ill add that I found the Dubbing of the Quintessential Quintuplets very satisfying.  \n\nIll note that I have a very low standard though.  Growing up in the 90s with some pretty bad dubs and fan dubs when we got broadband in \u201899- then a looong break - getting back into anime in the last 5 years, has me really appreciative of so much of the anime now.  Even the dubs most people think are so so, I typically enjoy anyway.",

For a show that has super low production quality the dub is actually really good.\n\nThe Ancient Majus Bride. Dani Chambers does an amazing job voicing Chise. Really good at voicing chise's shy quite moments, but also you can just feel the emotion in her voice in other moments.",

If you tried using English with Japanese inflections, the characters would come across as unbalanced. But if you\u2019re used to the Japanese, changing that into English is going to have a different feel. And when you like something, you don\u2019t want it to change.",

Other dubs I can think of off the top of my head that I like are Little witch academia, Attack on titan, Death note, Haikyuu, and Bleach.  I love Ichigos dubbed voice actor. He has the same voice actor as Lelouch from Code geass (which is another good dub imo), and Giyu from demon slayer. He is an amazing voice actor. Just *chefs kiss*",

I'm not saying it has the worst dub or anything remotely close to it but I fail to see how it's the best dub ever. Personally, it felt pretty decent and I didn't feel like anything was mind-blowingly outstanding about the dub script. It was of as-usual quality. \n\nThe only real answer to the question posed by the OP would be: No single dub is specifically the best simply because the overall dubbing standard reached a standstill of decency that it's become somewhat rare to see an unbelievably superior quality dub. \n\nThough from time to time, there are some exceptions to it. Summer Time Rendering, it wasn't bad, just that it was somewhat tough to listen and separate background noise from the character's voice. There's also Stein's;Gate. I don't know from where I watched it but it, too, felt like it had the same issue as the above. Hard to make out the words with the inseparable background noise. I don't think there was any issue with the dub script or the VAs in any of these two mentioned series. It was up to the usual standard in those two aspects. Just that the problems lied elsewhere.  \nI think, going forward, if we are to encounter \"bad dubs\", it won't be the loose script and ad-libbing with obnoxious artistic liberty kinda ones from the by-gone eras. It'll be sound-mixing fumbles or similar stuff like that where inexperienced people are tasked to handle the important jobs or the product was unreasonably hyper-rushed. \n\nMost of the commenters suggesting AoT, MHA, FMA:B, CSM, and stuff like that haven't watched much outside those. If they did, their usual response would also be something like, \"overall most of the dubs are good, with a few occasional fumbles, here and there.\"",

It has a very large cast, and almost all the voices perfectly fit their characters. (I didn\u2019t particularly like Al\u2019s voice in Brotherhood as much as I liked it in the original series. He sounds too much like a girl in FMAB, but the voice acting itself was still good.) But the translations are solid, convey what they need to, there is the right balance of drama and humor in the intonations \u2014 not over done, not flat \u2014 the interactions in the dialog seem natural, not spliced together (which many animes do, because they are), the pacing is excellent, the direction was good.

Like, Hunter x Hunter, Your Lie in April, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Konosuba and The Rising of the Shield Hero are all amazing in sub, but the dubs for both are very good as well. Not as good as the sub, but still a worthy alternative. There are much more great dubs being produced today than 20 years ago. I've noticed also that Funimation tends to produce high quality dubs on average. There's also dubs that start of meh, but become good later on, like Attack on Titan and Re:Zero\n\nMy favourite dubs include:\n\n* Cowboy Bebop (the gold standard)\n* My Hero Academia\n* The Devil is a Part Timer\n* Overlord\n* The Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime\n* Death Note\n* Samurai Champloo\n* Steins; Gate\n* Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n* Dragon Ball Z: Kai",

Can't make out who voices the equally-if-not-more-wicked Prime Minster Wardack, though.\n\n&gt;!The way I see it, Zabune, Dacia, and Wardack's punishment is more than fitting (they made innocents into slaves, and now they themselves will live out the rest of their lives as slaves while their own slaves roam free). A death sentence was far too good for any of them.!&lt;",

Like the sarcastic lead in Is This A Zombie, Ruth in Magus Bride, or Obi in Snow White with the Red Hair. But I can hear his more outbursts to sound close.",

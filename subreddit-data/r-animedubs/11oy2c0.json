Wasn't expecting her to be raised as some kind of sacrifice to trick the demons. That's a raw deal. And that's not even taking into account what happened to her brother.\n\nI'm really liking Seika as a character so far. He's not completely heartless, and I think overall he's a good, compassionate person, but he's smart, not overly nice, and knows when the ruthless route is the best one.",

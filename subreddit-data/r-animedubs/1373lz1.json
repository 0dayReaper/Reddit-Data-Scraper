Super satisfying long term romantic development. \n\nReLIFE. Different spin on the de-aged school rom com. The special episodes after the main season are a necessity.\n\nIroduku. Time travel in a world with magic, but magic is more like a fun hobby. Subtle romantic development. Plenty of angsty teen drama. Vibrant art style.\n\nOrange. Sensitive subject matter, but handles it well. Ensemble high school cast with a love triangle. Suwa is one of my favorite characters. Technically sci-fi, but that\u2019s not important. \n\nKids on the Slope. Set in high school, but make no mistake it\u2019s an adult drama. Plenty of fun jazz pieces and broken hearts. \n\nA Lull in the Sea. Tangled web of romances between the people of the land and the people of the sea. Without saying too much, the plot experiences some drastic occurrences. \n\nTomo-chan is a Girl. Tomboy falls for dense meathead childhood friend. Don\u2019t worry about a lack of resolution like with most single cour rom coms. Personally, Carol steals every scene she\u2019s in.",

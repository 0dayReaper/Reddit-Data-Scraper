Romantic comedy that's mostly heartfelt, but with little dramas throughout each episode as the characters explore relationships and friendships.\n\nOrange - Another great one.  Certainly a mix of drama and melancholy, and definitely more serious than most.  Best be prepared with a box of tissues.",

            "comment": "[Just Because](https://www.livechart.me/anime/2700) is a sorely underrated, grounded teenage drama. It does a fantastic job capturing that exciting, nervous, wistful period at the end of high school. It also portrays *friendships* and not just relationships in a way that feels a lot more authentic than most series.\n\n[Fuuka,](https://www.livechart.me/anime/2267) on the other hand, is *inauthentic* teenage *melo*drama, but I do think that it's done well. Fanservice warning: You're going to see a lot of completely unnecessary toplessness. Almost the entire plot hinges on a string of coincidences and larger-than-life characters, but if you can accept the implausibility of it all, this series about the formation of a teenage garage band and the love life of the bassist is pretty enjoyable. The series also has a few facets that are largely ignored (or downplayed) in anime and manga, which was interesting to see.\n\nThere's [Toradora](https://www.livechart.me/anime/3420) from the same author as Golden Time. Most communities I've seen tend to prefer Toradora over GT, but I personally thought GT had better writing. If you liked one, there's at least a reasonable chance you'd like the other.",

I just recently(ish) rewatched it and it holds up, it's the.... third time I've seen it and I think I appreciate it more each time. Like, it's a series where I feel that I understand the characters better, because my opinion after the second (and third) watch was *way* different than my opinion the first time.\n\nThen it's got a really strong dub on top of the excellent mood and characterization.",

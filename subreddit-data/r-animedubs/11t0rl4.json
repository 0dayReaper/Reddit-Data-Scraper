The two romance shows they grabbed are also major hopefuls as well (including Kubo-san's return from its hiatus this winter).\n\nWill it be the [big smash that they're hoping for](https://archive.is/H3kx1), especially with no Anne Rice shows airing during this period? You'll just have to find out next season.\n\nAfter all, just because their stock went up last month doesn't meant that [they're no longer on thin ice](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/03/16/2628675/16019/en/AMC-Networks-Announces-the-Termination-of-its-Cash-Tender-Offers-for-Senior-Notes-due-2024-and-2025.html). They can only hope that Saul Goodman's cache is huge enough for AMC's subbers to watch Bob Odenkirk's new show this Spring too. There's also the issue of HiDive's limited reach globally compared to CR, meaning one of the biggest shows of this season is basically unavailable legally in many parts of the world. Shame.",

Although there are a few exceptions that are due to Naruto's status as (with few exceptions) a union-contract dub (whereas Bleach is non-union).\n\nAside from Steve Blum, Crispin Freeman, Kari Wahlgren (&amp; Maile Flanagan, Naruto herself), there's a few actors rarely in anime that you don't hear in the Bleach dub: Fred Tatasciore, Chris Edgerly, Matt Kim, Jennifer Hale, Josh Keaton even Wil Wheaton and Nolan North were in various Naruto properties.

With most filler arcs the show just pauzes the main storyline to jump to something completely different, but I believe the Bount arc is the exception. It doesn't really add anything significant to the show, but it's somewhat entertaining.\n\nThe Zanpakuto arc at the end adds something to the worldbuilding, but like I said, it just pauzes the main story to show you a completely different arc and might indeed mess with your immersion. If you don't mind that it's worth a watch still. Or if you haven't had your fill of Bleach after finishing the anime you might as well go back for the filler.",

She gets few main character roles now, and most of her characters are minor supporting characters who only appear in a few episodes a show.\n\nTwo things happened:\n\n- 1] she started dating Kensho Ono in 2016, and \n\n- 2] much more importantly, she tried to chase Chinese money (just like Mika Kobayashi, the former songstress who did so many of the belting vocal songs in Hiroyuki Sawano's soundtracks until 2016). Hanazawa was studying Mandarin and appearing on tons of Chinese variety shows and performing concerts in the PRC from 2016-2019.\n\nThen COVID-19 happened, and I guess all that sucking up to China didn't work out so well for her since the PRC kicked out all foreigners and locked their borders. She came back to Japan, finally married Ono, and looks like she's trying to rebuild her star power now.",

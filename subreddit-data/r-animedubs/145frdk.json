Coming on Netflix, Studiopolis produced the English dub.\n\nGet Ready to hear more of Troy Baker as Baki again! (I\u2019ve always really wanted to say this before for this anime, something I wanted to say); \n\n\u201cBaki isn\u2019t just some role that Baker is playing, it\u2019s proof that the All Star Video Game Veteran still shows connection and a cheerful heart towards his long past experience of Anime Dubbing, and it helped turned him into the incredible actor he is today.\u201d",

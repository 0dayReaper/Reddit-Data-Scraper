But what if Funimation, Viz Media, or Sentai Filmworks dubbed the anime or games? I mean, many of these anime actors also perform in video games. Which actors would you cast as which anime/game character?\n\nHere are some of my choices:\n\nTara Platt as Cynthia\n\nTodd Haberkorn as Brock\n\nColleen Clinkenbeard as Lusamine\n\nJohnny Young Bosch as Gladion\n\nErika Harlacher as Lilie\n\nMela Lee as Misty\n\nJohn Swasey as Giovanni\n\nCherami Leigh as May\n\nYuri Lowenthal as N",

While I do agree this would be a good pick, I'm one of the few people who doesn't have a crush on this character and if this happened that would no longer be the case because she always makes \"okay\" characters become \"Ara ara\"\n\n&gt; Colleen Clinkenbeard as Lusamine\n\nThis actually depends on if we're just replacing the current anime cast or if we're doing a theoretical reboot more accurate to the games.  \n\nIf it's just the anime that already aired than she'd be a good pick, but if we're going more accurate for the games than this won't work at all and Michelle Marie would be a better choice since she can do the seemingly innocent but actually batshit insane like Lusamine is in the games.\n\n&gt; Cherami Leigh as May\n\nShe actually voiced Iris in *Generations*",

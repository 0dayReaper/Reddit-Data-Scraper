I have a list of anime I've seen and couldn't remember the exact plot of all of them so any of them were the hero fights with a sword just made this list. I wanted to put down all the ones that were similar to not get any suggestions I've already seen. I just finished Rising shield hero and black summoner and really like the fantasy world hero that has to gain skill points like in a video game. That's what I'm currently into. Before this it was romance anime. Thanks for your suggestions.",

Some more that might also fit: Reincarnated as a Slime, Reincarnated as a Sword, and Reincarnated as a Spider (ok so the spider one is actually called \"So I'm a Spider, So What?\", so what?). They get skills instead of XP, but fit the idea of \"video game-like system where MC gains power.\" \n\nAlso, I'm pretty sure one or both of \"The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter\" and \"The 8th Son? you Gotta Be Kidding Me!\" have an XP system of some sort. Been awhile since I watched those, so I don't remember exactly.",

First show that ever made me go start reading the light novel (they're even doing a new \"project\" for it a dozen years after season 2, though i don't think they've said whether it's a movie, a sequel, or a reboot. I'm hoping for a season 3.",

Recently Crunchyroll became available and with the Merger, I get to catch up on all the Anime. Unfortunately, those are the only options available to me and I don't want to pirate anymore now that I have the option to support the artists in some way. So I'm stuck waiting for these odd missing seasons.",

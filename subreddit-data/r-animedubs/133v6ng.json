I think these days, they prefer to wait for all the episodes of the sub of a show to finish before they could dub it.\n\nIf you ask me about the approximate timeframe of the Oshi no Ko dub, my guess is that at the earliest, we'll probably get the dub after Danmachi 4 Part 2 ends since it was the first winter dub to start. Also, I hope Kyle Jones gets to direct the Oshi no Ko dub since he's in my view the best out of the three directors. Worst case scenario is that the dub might start after the second cour of Urusei Yatsura ends. But who knows when, Sentai can be unpredictable at times.",

They could just drop soon in the future. \n\nAs for Princess Principal Crown Handler, he also already finished dubbing the first two films, in fact I watched them both, and the third film just released in Japan several weeks ago. I don't think it's gonna be a while before Kyle could start working on that as well.",

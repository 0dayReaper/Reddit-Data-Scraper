            "comment": "Hey y'all! Aleks Le, voice of Thorfinn here! To clarify: no cameras were allowed in the studio so this is a live performance of this scene (done in the exact same way that we did for the episode). Most of the long scenes in this episode were done in 1 continuous take, at my request. It was an incredibly difficult method, but I think it was really worth it. This scene was the culmination of Thorfinn\u2019s countless years of bottled up emotions, trauma, &amp; regrets. I wanted to give it everything I had! (excuse da ugly cry face). Please check out the episode &amp; I hope you enjoy!",

We appreciate all your hard work and effort. You really are an amazing voice actor! Lastly, I just wanna say I also love your performance as Mikey in Tokyo Revengers. I hope I get the honor of meeting you some day! \ud83d\ude0a",

It's such a brave thing for actors to show such vulnerability, a look into their soul when they work. You should be damn proud of this. We're all so impressed. You killed it!",

            "comment": "Thats the show done for now, a shame really as things are about to really interesting with the way this ends, though I can't see how this ends in 5 more episodes so I have to assume this was intended to go for much longer. \n\nAlso, it does indeed sound like (though, not confirmed) that Eden Riegel returns as Devola and Popola, which is very good. Excited to see this when it returns, till whenever that is",

And this episode is really perfect because also returning and making her appearance from the game and finally making her proper speaking appearance since that cameo all the way back in Episode 2.\n\nThe Twins Devola and Popola are once again being played by recently amazing Voice Director on Disney and Critical Role Sam Riegel\u2019s Younger Sister:\n\nEden Riegel!!!\n\nA big Name and a big return, I say a good way to end an episode before going on an indefinite hiatus, I\u2019m satisfied, see you soon Nier. :)",

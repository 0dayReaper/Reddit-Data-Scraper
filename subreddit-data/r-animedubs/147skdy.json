            "comment": "Season 2 of Higurashi is literally directly connected to the first season.  And... Even with the newer seasons.  It helps to know what happened in the original seasons.  So.  I don't think you can skip the non-dubbed seasons unfortunately. \n\n(Higurashi is a top 5 anime of all time for me.  So.)\n\nHigurashi goes in question and answer arcs.  First season is the question arc.  Second season is the answer arc.  So. You need to watch both to get the complete story of each section in the series.    The fact they never dubbed season 2 AT LEAST with the new cast - which would basically print money.  Has always been surprising to me.",

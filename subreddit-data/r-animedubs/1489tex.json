    "postText": "Basically, which actor was perfectly matched with a character. \n\nHere\u2019s my list: \n\n1. Todd Haberkorn as Natsu Dragneel \n\nHe portrays Natsu\u2019s chaotic/angry/silly sides so incredibly well. \n\n2. Kaiji Tang as Satoru Gojo \n\nKaiji is perfect for Gojo. He can portray Gojo\u2019s funny/chaotic and badass moments so well. \n\nErika Harlacher as Yumeko Jabami\n\nShe adds excitement and tension to every gambling scene, especially when Yumeko goes crazy. \n\nJohnny Yong Bosch as Lelouch vi Britannia\n\nJohnny has great range in any role he plays and Lelouch isn\u2019t an exception. Johnny is able to make Lelouch a compelling character by showing his calculating and sympathetic sides.",

His ability to switch seamlessly from his more high pitched normal voice for Suzuki Satoru to a deep and sinister voice for Ainz is nothing short of amazing. His Ainz voice also really makes the character sound like a supervillain, perhaps more so than the sub.\n\nWhenever I read the novels, I always read it in his voice and fits perfectly.",

If you've seen Princess Tutu and haven't watched the bts clips of her recording this show, I highly recommend it. I can't think of anyone else at the time who could have nailed this role with the same level of over-the-top silliness where you're laughing alongside her rather than *at* her and her antics and earnest vulnerability.\n\n**Jamieson Price** as The Count (Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo). The absolute standout of this cast by far, and while Price could read the phone book and it would sound amazing, this is one of my favorite roles of his that doesn't get as much attention compared to say, Rider from Fate/Zero.\n\n**Matt Mercer** as Trafalgar Law (One Piece). I know Mike pretty much cast him because it was another Kamiya role around the same time he was recording AoT (said so much in a bts interview), but occasionally the best casting choice *is* the most obvious choice haha. \n\n**Zeno Robinson** as Hawks (MHA). Casting has always been one of Colleen's biggest strengths as a director, and frankly over half the MHA cast could fit in this reply. Mentioning this one though since it was such a hyped up role for a show already at its peak of popularity. One quite a few people expected to go to a big name. But I think from the moment that first movie promo clip came out that same mass of fans were completely on board and thinking \"oh yeah that's pretty much spot on.\"\n\n**Billy Kametz** as Galo (Promare). Stephanie Sheh has spoken about how difficult it was to cast Galo specifically until she was recommended Billy. Just absolutely embodied the soul of that character and matched his energy perfectly.\n\nAlso it's too difficult for me to narrow down two major roles for **Ian Sinclair** (Space Dandy &amp; Brook), **Brina Palenica** (Holo &amp; Rin), &amp; **Johnny Yong Bosch** (Vash &amp; Lelouch) - but those are all examples of pitch perfect casting if I've ever heard it.",

I particularly have a hard time with names.\n\nBut I have been watching Anime with my son for a couple of years now and I'm really enjoying it.  He comes over on Monday nights, we have pizza and watch Anime while my wife is at work.\n\nSo far we have watched Guran Lagan, JoJo, (up to golden wind, we are starting that soon) Kill la Kill, Mob Psycho, Meglobox, Lupin III and just finished My Hero (up through Season 3).",

The story encompasses ships from various nations and tons of languages. When you listen to the sub they all just have Japanese dialects with no influence of the nation they represent. The British ships speak like the Japanese ships. Turn on the dub and suddenly the British ships speak with a British accent, German ships with a German accent, etc. I just wish the mobile game had dubs now too. \nI noticed the same playing out in the anime Infinite Stratos. It just made it a bit more immersive for me.\nI'm not saying it's the best voice acting or that the accents are 100% realistic.. But they're better than none.",

Why is it that I never see dub people trying to bash sub users but always see sub people trying to bring down dub watchers? Do some sub users just feel some sort of inadequacy, they're mad that dubs users can just sit back and enjoy watching dubs while they're trying to have their \"authentic\" experience. I like dubs more than subs, I like movies more than the book, I have a record player but I listen to a lot of Apple Music, sometimes I even like a McDonalds burger more than steak. \n\nIf I'm an Anime writer or artist, I 100% want good dubs of my series, why wouldn't I want to share my works with as many people as possible. Not too mention the extra money it brings in. How many english speakers would've never started watching anime in the first place if it wasn't for dubs. They've been apart of anime culture for 50+ years now, seems like an authentic part of the industry to me. \n\nIF you want the real authentic experience than subs and dubs aren't the answer, head over to duolingo and learn Japanese.",

For example, they can't say non-japanese names for shit. For example, my brother Nicholas is ''Nikurasu'' for them. That's stupid as fuck and always takes me out of the moment. Light is Raito, Lelouch is Rarush and so on. Second, they can't do accents for shit. Anime time there is a show where there are multiple cultures interacting, they just give the foreigners a kantai dialect and pretend that this is a foreign accent. Bull fucking shit it is. In english, you can do american, british, german, france, russian and many other accents, and instantly make the characters feel, as he put it: Authentic. \n\nAlso, subs are not more accurate. There are things that don't carry over either way. Subs are just another group of people translating a work, same as dubs.",

Though, I will say that aggressively insulting Japanese pronunciations of English names is just as unfair as the arguments insulting English VAs pronouncing Japanese names. The fact that dubs can utilize accents is a brilliant point, by the way, and I can guarantee that it's a persuasive way to validate dubs without the vitriol-- I'm definitely going to go with dubs for anime where accents would be a factor, now.",

And there just aren't sounds for a few things english uses, like \"L\", which is just substituted with \"R\" because \"R\" is actually kind of like a half-step between \"L\" and \"R\" in terms of how they form the sound. Because that distinction doesn't exist in their language, it's like trying to distinguish between indigo and purple.\n\nThe key difference is that Japanese names always include sounds that are entirely within the English language. So, while they might sound less ridiculous when they're way off in pronouncing Japanese, there's also less of an excuse.\n\nI definitely agree with you that heavy use of badly-pronounced English (or other non-Japanese names) in a subbed anime can be quite off-putting, I'm just trying to give a heads-up that the common, irritating argument you'll hear from sub elitists is often about pronouncing things, too, and it'll be hard to fight fire with fire, there.\n\nPersonally, though, what bothers me WAY more is when they use English loanwords... but then give them COMPLETELY different meanings. Especially how casually they'll use English swearing because Japanese seems to have no concept of \"inappropriate\", just \"rude\". Seriously suuuuuper off-putting to have school-kids using \"bitch\" as if it meant \"floozy\" in subs and such. So I definitely get what you mean, man.",

            "comment": "As someone who enjoys watching other people watch anime about as much as watching anime itself, I end up watching quite a lot of both subs and dubs. I have to say that most people who prefer one over the other are either watching them in close proximity or they don't watch much of one or the other. I do think that *for every individual*, there is a \"better\" way to watch, and it depends on how they, personally, watch a subbed or dubbed show, respectively. They each have some pretty objective strengths, whereas the usual flame wars tend to just be debating some purely subjective qualities.\n\nThe fact that dubbed shows are more accessible cannot be overstated. Very, very few people would have ever watched anime in the first place without dubs, and the cultural \"reach\" that a good dub can add is really important for the medium. But accessibility isn't the only strength. Localization, for all the problems it can sometimes cause, is extremely important for providing context to a story that an audience outside of Japan will often be lost without. All Might's engrish might be hilarious, but Sabat's over-the-top portrayal of him is no less entertaining a large ham that accomplishes the same impression even for someone with no knowledge of Japanese language or culture, which is great.\n\nBut I would have to say that the greatest potential strength of a dub is the ability to divorce an anime from the bog of anime tropes that can drag a story or character down. Looking at Cowboy Bebop, for example, Spike is \"stuck\" with the legacy of Lupin influencing his character's portrayal in the sub, whereas his character in the dub feels less \"diluted\" by the tropes established by predecessors in the medium. Characters can be portrayed as *people,* without the baggage a Japanese VA often has towards \"conform to the archetype\", which has the potential to emphasize the more unique, compelling facets of a character rather than revel in tropes that aren't always necessary. Rewriting characters entirely is still contentious, mind, and I'm not saying a dub can't lose important context for a character's personality by dropping tropes, winding up with a more generic and uninteresting cast... but, done well, the results *can* be greater than the sum of its parts when some of those parts are tired tropes that didn't need to be there in the first place.\n\nDubs are also often the perfect way to watch anime that are focused on their action and visual presentation, and for anime that are located in places that relate very little to Japan and its culture. Full Metal Alchemist, for example, is a great example of an \"equal\" sub and dub, where most people can agree that the dub is done well and that the sub is done well. But I would never really go out of my way to recommend the sub, as the show's setting blends well with localization, and the fact that the dub is done well means it's only going to be easier to follow the action.\n\nStarted with dubs because most arguments seem to start there, but I also wanted to explore why many people tend to find subbed anime more engaging-- I'm not trying to invalidate anyone's preference, just consider their strengths, mind. The greatest strength (and, arguably, the greatest flaw) in watching a subbed anime is the fact that you have access to as much information as possible. Information is never omitted, character interactions are never \"watered down\", and motivations or concepts are explained with all of their concepts. Someone *detail-oriented* will often prefer to watch subs, and many people become more detail-oriented as they invest more time into any interest, so it's little surprise that many gravitate towards subs as they watch more.\n\nJust as accessibility cannot be overstated, I really must reiterate how important that \"full information\" can be. Dialogue-heavy moments in anime, especially those that are deeply seated in Japanese langage or culture, can be a nightmare to navigate when dealing with missing information, and it's incredibly easy for certain subtleties to be completely omitted entirely. I would generally say that the dub and sub for MHA are both quite good, but I can't lie about the disappointment I felt when Uraraka's meaningful breakdown of \"Deku\" as sounding like the kanji for \"do your best\" was reduced to... \"well, a girl said it sounded cool\".\n\nBut that \"omission of information\" is by no means exclusive to dubs. Subs are by no means perfect translations, to say nothing of the fact that the transition from manga/LN to anime is generally going to abridge quite a bit regardless. Even with only baseline fluency in the language, I've still noticed some misleading sub work that under-explains, and I'm sure we've all experienced \"but, in the manga\" discussions at some point. Dubbing just means adding another *chance* to lose information... which, admittedly, does mean I personally gravitate towards subs a bit more often than not.\n\nSubs are also extremely appropriate for anime where their archetypes and tropes are closely tied into the story they have to tell, and how their characters are developed. Especially when the anime is heavily based in dialogue and it has a relevant Japanese setting. As an example, Steins; Gate is an anime with an extremely good dub and sub and some talented writing on both ends... but, just as I'd recommend the dub for Full Metal Alchemist for its setting and focus on action, I'd recommend the sub for Steins; Gate for its setting and focus on character interaction. It's not that the dub or sub are \"better\" or \"worse\", but that the context for each specific anime feels to fit better with specific modes of watching. Makise Kurisu being described as a tsundere in the sub, for example, makes it much more intuitive to recognize that pattern of behavior as a defense mechanism. Complex example to give, as many characters within that specific anime actually benefit from being divorced from tropes, but I'm certainly under-qualified to be giving out perfect explanations anyway (as evidenced by my complete lack of brevity in this post).\n\ntl;dr: Basically just agreeing with the idea of subs and dubs each having their own pros and cons, but also going on to argue that there are *objective* benefits to each, rather than the differences being purely subjective. Which spiraled off into also trying to explain why people like each and giving examples and whatnot because I am *hella* unfocused, apparently. I mean damn, even the tl;dr's too long.\n\ntl;dr;tl;dr: Yes to the premise, \"but also\" to the examples.  \n\n\nEdit: Also, two more points mentioned in this thread: accents and following overlapping voices are both big deals as key strengths of dubbing go. Aaand I forgot to actually address the \"authentic\" tripe in the picture just being a terrible way to phrase the idea of \"sometimes a minor detail is lost in translation\", which I assume is what they were trying to say.",

Like I do understand your point, but at the same time, it just made more sense to me for her to act and sound the way she did in the dub. Like she grew up in America and in the dub, it really shows (I think casting Trina Nishimura was just perfect. For some reason I think she has a really, really subtle Japanese sound to her voice too and I'm not quite sure if I'm just imagining it because I know she's part Japanese, but yeah I adore her as Kurisu.) Aside from that, her treating the way she did Okabe in the dub still appears plenty recognizable as a defense mechanism. I can go on and on about how much I love the way they adapted her in the dub, but I'd be gushing all day. In any case, most if not all of the characters have been toned or smoothed out for better or worse. It worked for me, it's as if I knew these people in real life and most of them no longer felt like anime archetypes. I guess I'm also just a fan of subtle everything, so the way some dubs tone things down and have a more understated performance at times just work really well for me.\n\nAnyway, apologies for the wall of text.

To be fair, though, Steins;Gate has one of the best subs -and- dubs that I've ever watched, so I kind of treat them each as almost being their own respective show. Always find some fun new detail each time I watch either of them, and I tend to use youtube reactions as an excuse to rewatch it, so I've probably just watched the sub a few more times. Proooobably the only anime I've watched more than 30 times. That said, I also completely agree for how smoothing out the often-dead-horse tropes smooths out every other character's portrayal in the show. Daru, for example, is a pretty grating archetype played straight in the sub. Makise Kurisu was just my example of \"sometimes, those played out tropes do actually serve a purpose in describing a character's mindset\", but... honestly, if you were to ask me which performance I preferred, my opinion would change every time because they're both so good. It's like Okabe-- I seriously can't decide which mad scientist is more entertaining because both are just done so well.\n\nBut yeah, I just need to find more examples where the trope-nixing is actually detrimental, as it's often... actually just a huge advantage. Definitely the \"best thing about dubs that no one really talks about\", though-- the fact that they aren't \"stuck\" with the tropes that drag way too many anime down with repetitive stereotypes.\n\nMy favorite show is definitely also Steins;Gate, but my favorite dubs, specifically, are definitely FLCL, Full Metal Alchemist, and Cowboy Bebop, as I feel like those really elevate the show into feeling way more engaging as a dub. Most shows I enjoy of-late I tend to just watch both, though, because any excuse to rewatch more MHA or such is just too tempting. ^^",

Looking back on it, I feel like I must have really underappreciated just how good that dub was-- everything about how the characters interact sounded so natural, and really that's the most important part of any good dub. Definitely a show in the camp of \"I'd rewatch it, but then I'd be stuck reminding myself of how much I want more seasons,\" though. :x\n\nBut yeah, rewatched Steins; Gate twice more since the first reply, because I have a serious problem, and man... it really does feel a cut above so many other also-great dubs I've watched that it's hard to overstate how well it's done. It's normally so tempting to pit sub against dub, but they're just -both- in such a league of their own, lol.\n\nLikewise on the witty banter, though, I will say that any show that can translate that kind of feeling into the dub is doubly impressive in my book, considering the insane talent is shows off in localization and delivery alike.\n\nTo be clear, Steins;Gate is an anomaly for me. Noooormally just watch an anime once or twice. Though, some of the ones I've watched more than twice are stuff like One Piece, because I must have brain parasites or something to watch that three times. Second-highest rewatch count is probably a dozen-ish times for shows I watch reactions to, like My Hero Academia, One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100, and Re: Zero (clearly the odd one out among those).\n\nSide note to the side note, now I have the brilliantly terrible-in-all-the-best-ways One Piece dub opening repeating in my head. Honestly, even when they're \"bad\", sometimes that makes a dub even more entertaining... Pokemon's doughnuts are still one of my favorite things ever.",

And also I don't like anime in subs if the setting is more in English or British like \"Princess Principal\" and \"Angels of Death\" but I like \"Drifters\" and \"Katsugeki Touken Ranbu\" in original Japanese dub since it is set in prehistoric Japan but with exception like \"Samurai Champloo\" and \"Rurouni Kenshin\" because for me it is superior in English dub. I love both language but when it comes to quality it is dubs FTW.",

I have watched a few things in sub, like anime movie events at the local theatre. But I usually stay away from sub because of 1) my sub elitist friend who thinks I\u2019m dumb that I can\u2019t read a full sentence of dialogue in 1 second, and 2) the multiple anime and anime movies I\u2019ve seen that have about 2 or 3 people talking at once about different things. Though fun, watching the Konosuba movie in sub at the theatre was a nightmare because of the moments where multiple characters were talking at once. I had to go see the movie a second time so I could read the other dialogue I missed from those moments\u201d",

            "comment": "Gonna try and be civil but I still don\u2019t understand in this day in age (where dubbing is ubiquitous, high quality and we have access to easily transferable digital media) why anyone would choose subs in anime.  Seriously I don\u2019t.  \n\nI\u2019ve read things about the history of anime and how in the 70s-90s perhaps one argument held water: \nthat there simply were no dub studios, or that analog formats were rare and expensive so choosing between really bad dub and sub on VHS (when you either got one or the other not both) most would choose sub back then simply because the high risk that the dub was awful. But today with digital media, a large community of sub fans and content creators this is a mute point.\n\nI find the only real arguments that have any validity for subs over dubs today boil down to:\n\n1) I prefer reading.  \n\nThat\u2019s cool!  Maybe you\u2019ll like books or manga/comics better if that\u2019s your preferred media.\n\n2) Japanese is original language so translating that is always a bastardization of original intent.  \n\nOk, but this argument is the same whether the translation is in written (sub format) or spoken/voice acted (dub).  If one translates spoken Japanese words (from the original Japanese anime) into English how does expressing that translation as spoke English words (dub) lose any more in translation than if those words were written at the bottom of the screen?  In fact to me there is way more opportunity for there to be an indirect or incomplete translation when subs are employed: simply put there are times when dialogue is so quick, idiomatic, obscure or referential that writing every single word is not feasible.  Don\u2019t believe me, watch an English audio cartoon (original) with English subtitles - guess what -  they don\u2019t always match up!  Subtitles were never intended to capture every word as a literal translation but rather convey conveniently the gist of the dialogue.  So the idea that somehow subs contain more accurate information in regards to the original is a fallacy.  And this makes perfect sense.  It is surely easier to fit in a quickly spoken translation than reams of literal text in terms of syncing action to dialogue; no one would argue we can\u2019t hear and understand faster than we can read and comprehend.    \n\n3) The voice acting is so much worse that I\u2019d just prefer to hear the Japanese dialogue.  \n\nOk fine to each her own, but again if you ask me: English voice acting is excellent now so wdym?  Also, personally, I\u2019d still prefer a really really shitty dub (if I could even find one) to a sub because imho it still outweighs having to read and split my focus.  Again these are Cartoons!  Funny annoying voices are par for the course.  Even the original audio \u201clooks lip-synced\u201d because it is!  Cartoon characters flap their mouths like a marionette\u2019s - essentially any language (whether original language, translated other language, or completely made up dialogue in any language with no regard to actual original meaning of script) all look equally silly or plausible.  \n\nI could go on...",

The show got me to read the manga which then ruined the show because the manga was so much better and the show was changing things. Everyone hated on the show because the manga was at its peak. Then it went off the rails and made many people angry so both ended up getting hate. I was so close to buying the entire collection and now I'll never read it again. Damn shame, but it's worth checking out at least once imo",

The characters are well-written to the point you can't resist rooting for them. There's a variety of music in the many insert songs. And the character faces are expressive, all the better to make those emotional climaxes land. Definitely would recommend for the experience.",

I personally enjoyed it and even watched it multiple times.  Your mileage may vary.  Give it the 2-3 episode go and see what you think. Hidive has the uncensored version also which is of note.

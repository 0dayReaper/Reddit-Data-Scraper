The only Fate game to even get dubbed into English was the Fate/Grand Order VR game and it's incredibly short with only 3 characters having any actual dialogue.",

There's no other major Fate anime that are super important to this or are a high priority (e.g. like Lord El-Melloi's Case Files feature Waver/El-Melloi II and Flat as main characters but I'm sure the Strange Fake anime will explain the general basics about them anyway)",

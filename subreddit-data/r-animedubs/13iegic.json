Numbers 2-5 are consistent, though they can reorder from season to season, but it's usually these names that are in my top 5 all time. And Numbers 6-25 for me personally is very fluid, even some I feel a love on the same tier as the rest. But it was hard keeping it to just 10, I know I've cut ALOT of my faves.",

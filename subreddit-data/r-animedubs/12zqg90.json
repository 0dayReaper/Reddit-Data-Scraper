Ranking of Kings was probably my favorite anime during the season it came out, and still upset it didn\u2019t win anime of the year for the Crunchyroll awards. But at least it was recognized. \n\nWe are all rooting for you Bojji!",

(It's crazy, I'll watch a \"dark\" show like School Live or any of the various death game shows out there no problem.  But a show like this?  Too depressing.  Same thing happened with Wonder Egg Priority.  I guess some of the themes of the show(s) themselves are what got to me - not the actual content.)",

I was not really a fan. It wasn\u2019t bad, I just feel like the huge twist in episode 1 was the best part of the entire show, and the series would have been 10x better if they waited later to reveal what was really going on.",

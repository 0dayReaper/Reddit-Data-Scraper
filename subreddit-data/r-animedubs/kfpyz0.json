            "comment": "Normally, I don't participate in a direct \"which is better\" debate between Original Japanese versus the English Dub. I feel like it's a mostly pointless endeavor, because it's impossible to judge the nuance of the acting and performance quality of a language I do not understand. Even when I prefer the dub for a show (which is often - it takes a really bad dub for me to be like \"ew no thanks\") I'll be hesitant to declare the dub \"better\" than the original just because I don't like making that comparison in the first place.\n\n_However,_ Shomin Sample is one of the shows where I will say that the dub is outright better than the original. The girls are all great, but the real highlight is Dallas absolutely killing it with his performance in this series. The main character in Japanese is unbelievably dry and monotone, even when his character is visibly excited, and the disconnect is just awful. It's worsened by some really awkward line choices in the original subtitled script, such as this very scene, where the protagonist compares the girl's thighs to \"meat wrapped in butcher's string\" and, with the flat performance, the Japanese version of the main character sounds like a fucking serial killer.\n\nEven some things you might _think_ were invented by the dub have roots in the original, but the dub is executed better. In the Japanese rant, the protagonist just shouts \"King Arthur! King Arthur!\" and there's no other context. It's a namedrop with no explanation. The dub's script at least turned the namedrop into a full metaphor, adding the bit about the search for the grail.",

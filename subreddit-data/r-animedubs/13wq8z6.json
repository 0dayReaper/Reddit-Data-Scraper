            "comment": "One of the things I noticed is that the star in Aqua's eye changes to black when he gets all dark, manipulative, and (for a lack of a better word) edgy. That manipulative and broody side of him is one of my favorite aspects of him as a character. I know Sentai's go-to edgelord MC voice actor is Adam Gibbs (and personally, he was my first or second prediction for Aqua). But I'm loving Jack Stansbury as him. He's hitting on all the right parts and he, along with Christina Kelly and Natalie Rial, have been my faves so far after two eps.\n\nAlso, as popular as the OP has been this season, can we also acknowledge the the ED slaps just as hard too?",

            "comment": "Aqua's VA is a good fit for the role. He really nails those scenes that show Aqua's darker side, and the ones where he's completely putting on an act posing as an idol scout. Almost sounded like two different characters. \n\nRuby's voice isn't quite what I had imagined after watching the sub, but she really sold those emotional lines so I think her performance was good overall. The scene with the director and his mom was spot-on, just as funny as it was the first time I watched it.",

If that makes any sense.\n\nCannot wait to see the next couple episodes.",

I was a little surprised when Ruby's (and Ai's) voices in the dub sounded different than I expected based on how I'm used to hearing them in the sub. If I had started with the dub though, I doubt I would have felt the voices were \"off\" in any way because the emotional beats of their scenes still came through really well.",

She does amazing as Miyako. \n\nI'm really starting to like english Ruby. Took some getting used to but I'm totally on board now.\n\nEnglish Aqua is perfectly casted. He does a great job with the ominous scary parts and also with the other aspects of Aqua, like when he was pretending to be a scout. Seems to have a good range for the many sides of Aqua.\n\nThe whole eng dub is great imo.",

            "comment": "Yeah I'll be honest, after watching this episode and comparing it to the sub, I'm not really feeling this dub. My two biggest issues are Ruby's VA who sounds incredibly stilted compared to the original, and the fact that the dub's script appears to be just a line-by-line read of the subtitles for the most part, without any real variation or adaptation of the script. That leads to some lines, though well acted and delivered, still feel....off somehow. Lip flaps are also not lining up in a few cases which gets distracting.\n\nI've seen worse dubs but for a series that is as high-profile as this and is by the same author who did Kaguya: Love is War, which has one of the best dubs I've ever seen, my standards are a bit too high for me to be just \"okay\" with it.",

Aqua's VA is not pretty bad, his voice especially during Aqua's serious and savage moments is just spot on as I imagined it, and I'm confident he'll continue to deliver a really good performance throughout. Natalie Rial is now so good as grown up Kana, and the fact that she even [cosplayed](https://twitter.com/NatalieRial/status/1658845227363315713) her only tells how much the role means to her, it's really awesome. Can't wait to see more of Kana in the next episode, looks like we're gonna have ourselves quite of a reunion, and how could I forget Christina Kelly standing out again as Miyako, seems she's also having fun with her role.",

            "comment": "It *is* an improvement over the premiere thankfully, but overall still not really connecting with Sentai's efforts here much beyond a couple performances (namely the previously mentioned Miyako, the director, and teenage-Kana - all of whom are think are 100% hitting their marks). I don't mind voices sounding different from the JPN, frankly I don't think most here *do* sound that different + there are plenty of dubs that *thrive* going for a different vocal print for good reason, and I sing their praises when I hear them. But I also just don't think how the performances are directed, nor the very conservative script, is doing anyone any favors. Even individual performances aside, it's just not a cohesive sound when you have some performers who are very in their element and the moment itself next to others who sound so removed and isolated for lack of a better term. It's a tough balancing act, and this isn't the first nor the worst dub to have this issue tbf. It's just a real shame considering the popularity of the show, and I wish I liked it more than I do considering there are some relative newcomers in the cast, which is always fun and exciting! I have a solid, even sub/dub ratio going this season thankfully, so I'm not too upset. But saying I'm not disappointed would be a lie.",

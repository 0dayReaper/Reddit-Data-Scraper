    "postText": "I've finally gotten my wife into anime (thank you, Spy x Family) but she's very picky. She enjoyed Horimiya and really liked Marin's energy from My Dress Up Darling. Here are her criteria:\n\nGood looking, or at least not ugly main characters (refuses to watch Toradora, Oregairu)\n\nGood art style, tends to prefer Clover Works or similar. She likes pastel colors and refused to watch Tomo-chan because her red hair clashed with her uniform. \n\nShe has ADHD, so something that'll keep the attention. For example, she got bored of Ice Guy in like 10 minutes. \n\nThey get together reasonably quickly\n\nNo harems\n\nHappy ending\n\nSorry, I know it's a lot, but thanks for any help.\n\nEdit: She also liked My Little Monster, Tsuredure Children, Fruits Basket ('19) until I told her it was 63 episodes, and My Dress Up Darling if it had less fan service and less of the design stuff (she has a bachelor\u2019s in fashion design and all the mistakes annoyed her).\n\nShe has rejected: Kaguya-Sama (I know, wtf?)\n\n ReLife\n\nKamisama Kiss\n\nAngel Next Door\n\n Bunny Girl Senpai (but liked the art style)\n\n Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun\n\nTsukigakire,\n\nIn/Spectre\n\nTonikawa\n\n Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie\n\nGolden Time\n\nLove of Kill\n\nGalaxy Next Door\n\nWotakoi\n\nRecovery of an MMO Junkie",

            "comment": "&gt;not ugly main characters (refuses to watch Toradora\n\nRyuuji isn't ugly, he's just got creepy eyes. It's a shame bc appearances being deceitful are a major theme in that show and that's part of what makes it so great\n\n&gt;She refused to watch Tomo-chan because her red hair clashed with her uniform. \n\nbro red and green are literally complimentary colors I'm - \ud83d\ude2d\n\nIn all fairness I think we all have design choices that are personally so off-putting, even if it doesn't make sense to others. I can't watch shows with characters that have hair accessories on their bangs because it's physically repulsive for me. On that note, have you tried **Kaguya-sama**? I can't personally vouch for it since I haven't seen it (literally just because of Chika's hair), but it's popular and seems to hit a lot of these notes.\n\nPrimary recs:\n\n**Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie**: Soft pastel color palette, cute characters, the couple is together from the start, wholesome and sweet, happy open ending. Main girl has some vague similarities to Marin, but less high-energy and a little more realistic.  \n\n**Kimi ni Todoke**: Main couple is sort of like a gender-swapped version of the one in Horimiya. Nice colors, great character development, same wholesome vibes.  \n\n**Tsurezure Children**: Similar vibes and art style as Horimiya but rather than focusing on one couple, it focuses on a few. Short, fluffy, and sweet. Not as much development as the other shows, but it's inoffensive and really easy to watch.\n\nSecondary recs:\n\n**CLANNAD &amp; Afterstory**: There are some harem elements but they never get in the way of the main couple and it's very obvious that the MC isn't interested in anyone else. It's a long show and a slow burn. The color palette is really pretty, but the character designs are rather outdated. It *does* have a happy ending, but it takes a while to get there.  \n\n**Fruits Basket (2019)**: Romance takes a backseat to drama in this case and most of the couples don't get together until the end, but the story gives a convincing reason as to why. The show is really lovely and has some of the best character drama and development I've seen in any anime. Amazing voice acting too. The manga and original anime have always been considered entry-level works and it's very easy to recommend to anime newcomers since it doesn't have a lot of typical anime BS.\nIt also deals with the same \"found family\" subject matter as Spy x Family and has all the same warm and fuzzies you get from that show.\n\nMaybe:\n\n**Ouran High School Host Club**: Attractive characters &amp; nice palette, but otherwise doesn't meet a lot of your criteria. It's comedy focused, a reverse-harem (sort of), the main couple doesn't get together and it has an open (albeit happy) ending, but it's funny, it has a great dub, and it's another beginner-friendly show.\n\n**Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun**: Like Ouran, it's comedy forward and none of the couples get together, but the cast is attractive and it's a genuinely funny show to watch.\n\nOthers: **Tonikawa: Over the Moon for You** &amp; **Snow White with the Red Hair**. I haven't seen either of these but I've heard good things and it seems they match your criteria, so maybe look into them as well.",

She watched Naruto because she kept seeing his shirts. if all of them fail, try a cute girls do cute things anime. My wife doesn't even watch cable anymore. oh slowly add in things like konosuba, but not to fast.",

She is making a huge mistake refusing it. \n\nWell, to be fair, she's making a mistake rejecting all of them for something as silly as colors or character attractiveness. \n\nNagatoro, Comi and Aharen-san may be three anime that are up her alley.",

            "comment": "This season wasn't as entertaining as the last, in my opinion. The occasional adventuring episodes and glimpse of Eliaria's school life were a welcome change of pace, but the focus on Ryouma's business didn't hold my interest, and the slice-of-life parts weren't enough to carry this series. It's still a decent, inoffensive fantasy show, though I found myself feeling bored more often than not during season 2. Overall, I'd rate the series a 7/10, with season 1 being the stronger material.",

I do hope this one gets another season.\n\nThere have been a shitload of isekai the last couple years but this one is among the more enjoyable of them for sure.",

I know nothing is official yet as far as I can find but I know nothing about how popular it is etc.\n\nHonestly even if the animation and original dub is...a bit rough...it also kinda works for it once you get used to it. Especially if you're into things like Romance of the three kingdoms.",

I originally thought the language would get kind of confusing especially after already watching the dub, it's actually not that bad.\n\nI usually prefer dub and still do with this but it's good enough and I hate waiting lol",

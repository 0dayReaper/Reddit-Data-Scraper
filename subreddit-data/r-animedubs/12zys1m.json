            "comment": "i feel like i have no worda for this anime. it is awful, but its also fucking hilarious and entertaining.\n\neverything about it screams shitty but somehow im still watching.\n\nthe 3 sticking points for shitty-ness to me is the weird absurdist humour, the oversexualized Mitama, and the absolutely fucking horrible cgi.\n\ntbh the absurdist humour to me is horrible but somehow got me watching for whatever reason. the main thing that comes to mind is the really strange opening scene in the first episode, nothing about it seemed normal. another one being the weirdo guy in the village that immediately proposes to Mitama, which is very cringe but funny at the same time.\n\nas controversial as this sounds, i really couldnt care less that Mitama, a loli, is sexualized. i am used to animes sexualizing everyrhing at this point. what i dislike about it however is that it kinda concerns me that she has been nude like, twice in both episodes, and once in the second episode that was strictly sexual. i have the creeping feeling that the sexualization is a cheap way to get people to watch, even if it is a loli. i never mind nudity, especially if the anime is good, but i am always a cynic in believing that for some animes, oversexualizing a character is a tactic to lure in people with no care for the rest of the show being good.\n\nthe cgi astounds me, when i saw a clip of it in r/anime i genuinely believed that it was some sort of joke. like one of those scenes in old anime where the characters are like \"yeah, the animators got tired so we had to make it less realistic\" type shit. but nope, with the fox, i believe that its intentional. as bad as the cgi is though somehow the cgi is doing more to carry the show than Mitama is, which is funny because it seems like the show is trying to lure loli enthusiasts in, and somehow the cgi is better.\n\nidk somehow the show is good, despite it having almost no redeemable things about it.\n\ntl:dr\n\nthe show is good, but i dont think it should be with its absurdist humour, sexualized loli, and terrible cgi",

They have the busty side characters for regular fan service (I almost cried laughing when the one went to chop off her boobs) and I\u2019m pretty sure no one is sexualizing Mitama except the one character whose whole schtick is that he is an absolutely disgusting and repulsive pervert (which is also hilarious, when that scene of him drinking the wine from her toes like in that Tarantino movie ended up being a fantasy I lost it)",

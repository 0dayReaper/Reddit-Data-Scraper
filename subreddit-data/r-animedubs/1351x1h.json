Clarissa has contacts in the underworld that make the illegal solutions easier to facilitate.\n\nSimply put if you need an assassin she can put you in contact with an assassin/ set the contract up. So I would say she and her group are neutral. She gets a bit more backstory later in the series, probably in the second cour if I had to guess.",

Apparently she takes out other killers. She did take the job on  Polka, who was said not to be a killer, so she's still a little bit nuts. Then again she was ready to off herself afterwards.\n\nThe concept of the troubleshooter group could make for an interesting plot.\n\nOne thing I'm not liking too much is the bits of humor and chibi drawings thrust randomly into the drama. I didn't like it in Magus Bride, i don't like it here.",

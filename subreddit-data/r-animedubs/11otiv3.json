            "comment": "Every episode, this show keeps giving me more and more reasons why it's my all time favorite anime.\n\nI LOVED seeing my boy use his multiple quirks in succession to not only combat Lady Nagant, but to also save Chisaki. Mental health aside, I'm really seeing the makings of a future #1 hero one day.\n\nBut I also loved Lady Nagant. Not only is Lindbeck a wonderful VA. But I also her character, her quirk, and with this episode, her backstory and motives. I'm glad I've felt a little hopeful for her, until freaking All For One's contingency plan. (Soon, sometime before this show is over, Deku is gonna punch the shit outta that man, and Im gonna shout glorious praise to the heavens.)\n\nLastly, I know it's very minor. And it's the last few seconds of the preview. But Deku's \"I'm fine\", Jesus, I know where this is going. And I felt that in my body. Can't wait for the next ep. Especially this week's sub ep, I'm super excited for CR to dub that. I've got so much I want to say for it.",

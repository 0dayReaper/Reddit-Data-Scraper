Doesn't look like they'll be slowing down anytime soon!\n\n**Cast:**\n\n* **Alexis Tipton** \\- Kaguya Shinomiya\n* **Aaron Dimuske** \\-  Miyuki Shirogane\n* **Jad Saxton** \\-  Chika Fujiwara\n* **Austin Tindle** \\- Yu Ishigami\n* **Ian Sinclair** \\- Narrator\n\n**Synopsis (via Funimation):**\n\n&gt;Known for being both brilliant and powerful, Miyuki Shirogane and Kaguya Shinomiya lead the illustrious Shuchiin Academy as near equals. And everyone thinks they\u2019d make a great couple. Pride and arrogance are in ample supply, so the only logical move is to trick the other into instigating a date! Who will come out on top in this psychological war where the first move is the only one that matters?",

I think it was a great decision to change the character's style, because that style of screaming dramatically - I've never seen that work effectively in English, it just doesn't come off as authentic and intense enough, it often comes off sounding strange. So I think it was an excellent idea to essentially craft their own version that works in English.

Weekly dubbing releases, even if the episodes are batched into 1-4 episode chunks for internal production, still requires a lot of scheduling and multiple sessions.\n\nWith the whole series at their disposal, some roles (especially minor recurring ones) can get their initial recording complete in a single session.\n\nNow, as old as Kaguya S1 is, Funi likely had access to all the materials for a long time - it's been nearly a year since the dub was announced in the first place - but, yeah, having those materials all at once definitely streamlines the logistics.",

It locks all the dub only watchers out of the dub, thus it's only for those who either watched season 1 subbed already, or who literally don't care. \n\nAnd I know they justify it by saying that since the japanese sequel season is airing, it's more popular, and thus they dub it first, while the hype is high. But again, that makes no sense, since despite the hype being high, they are cutting out a lot of potential watchers. \n\nHere is what a smart tactic would be: if the series has a popular season airing in japan right now, use that hype to get season 1 dubbed, while season 2 is airing, and then smoothly transition into season 2 dub, one you are done with season 1. It's still using the currently airing shows clout, to get people watching.",

It is annoying that we've never gotten a concrete reason for it, but this seems the most likely.\n\n&gt;Here is what a smart tactic would be: if the series has a popular season airing in japan right now, use that hype to get season 1 dubbed, while season 2 is airing, and then smoothly transition into season 2 dub, one you are done with season 1.

Which granted is only about 10-12 clips. \n\nGranted I don\u2019t know your grievances, but every time someone has issue with it, and I\u2019ve asked the reason it becomes clear it\u2019s because they\u2019re super attached to the Japanese version and just dislike deviance from it.",

Unlike most dubs I find to be meh I have more negative to say about Kaguya's dub than I do positive. I'm also not a fan of how completely safe Funi played it with the cast. Part of what made the sub so interesting is that it was mostly lesser known actors with a ton of talent. The dub just gave us generic Jad Saxton/Aaron Dismuke/Alexis Tipton/Austin Tindle performances instead of something new and refreshing like Horimiya's dub.",

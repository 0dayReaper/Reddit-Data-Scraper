A women so pure she thinks praying at church fervently will have god send a stork from the cabbage patch to deliver their baby on the spot. As world's strongest male most females from races known for their strength attempt, and succeed, at either seducing or raping him to strengthen their own races. 2 seasons mostly dubbed with probability for a 3rd.\n\n *Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games Is Tough for Mobs* is more comical with some action. It is not particularly ecchi outside its OP/ED and a hot springs episode, but one of my personal favs with at least a second season on the way.",

For a more comical show with something to say, try Shimoneta. I am still amazed Shimoneta got dubbed, given all the things that come out of the main protagonist's mouth's every 5 seconds.",

However on its own the anime is pretty good.",

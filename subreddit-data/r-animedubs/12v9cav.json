    "postText": "So far in this Season, Sentai &amp; HIDIVE announced that Farming Skill in Another World and another Sequel, Danmachi S4 ( Second Cour ) is getting an English dub, and they surprised with **Oshi no Ko** getting a dub which is great and Sentai have some little improvement, maybe due to the popularity of the manga and the hype surrounding the anime premiere on social media and many forums .\n\nBut, what about other Spring anime titles? Well Sentai had a few shows like **Insomniacs After School, Otaku Elf, The Danger in My Hearts, Alice Gear Aegis Expansion,** and **Too Cute Crisis** all these titles they got were not action or Isekai full of Slice of Life and Moe and the problem is Sentai probably won't dub it (or should I say \"Sub only Jail\") they also got a Tokyo Mew Mew New S2, but sadly they already released the S1 BD in sub only although the majority voted yes on the survey poll on twitter, I hope they would call it a full collection re-release on Blu-ray like Shirobako or Chuunibyou.\n\nMy quick speculation is, it might have to wait and see until the other dubs like The Eminence of Shadow and Peter Grill S2 are done. So does anyone have any predictions or suggestions which other Spring shows will get DUBCAST and who will be the English voice actor for the anime ?",

It all comes down to just how willing Sentai is to dub them even though they're slice of life shows, which is basically not at all (I could be wrong, but I'm not holding my breath) given how they brushed off bunch of those in that genre in recent years for some reason.",

It's a nice slow romance/slice-of-life that feels quite realistic in its portrayal of the characters (design and personality wise) so it has a good chance for wider appeal. The others are more niche, even though I'm enjoying Kubo-san and Otaku Elf as well.",

Popular manga, Sentai *generally* seems to do romcoms, especially ones that contain some risqu\u00e9 humor.\n\nMy personal wish for this season is Insomniacs After School. I didn't even know about this series until the anime started. The first episode got me to order the manga. The second episode made me cry. It's just *so* good, from its art style and subtle but expressive animation, to its wonderful OST/BGM, to the character portrayal and writing. It already feels special in a way that I do not normally feel about most anime. I'd *love* for this to get dubbed.",

The focus is always on Twilight and Anya and them being on the job/at school. They're great, but Yor's work seems like it would be judt as fun to watch and it's a shame the one and only time we've seen it so far was for a couple minutes in episode 1.",

It's still a good show overall, but I didn't feel like continuing.\n\nThe premise made it seem more like they each have their own back stories revolving the plot, but instead after episode 3 or so Yor became more 2 dimensional. \n\nWe see Loid act as a Spy but rarely ever see Yor act as an assassin. She becomes a mom and her back story just isn't explored any further. She isn't murder momma anymore, she's a regular adoptive mom trying to do her best for Anya but without balancing any secret activity.",

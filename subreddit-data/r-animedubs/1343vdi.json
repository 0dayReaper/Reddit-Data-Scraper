Is this critique not valid to anyone here at all?",

Unfortunately not much Miorine this episode, and I was really hoping to see a direct follow up to her reaction at the end of last episode. Other than that though this was great.",

Apparently Martin didn't connect the dots about Nika being a terrorist, and no one caught onto the dummy companies endorsing the two terrorist psychos. Looks like they're willing to kill, too.\n\nI have this feeling people are dying in the next few episodes.\n\nI'm calling it now, Delling/Prospera's plan to use the Gund format to end strife involves either uploading everyone into machines, or using data storms to lobotomize everyone into obedient zombies.",

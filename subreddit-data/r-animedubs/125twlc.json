            "comment": "Incredible ending to a great romcom, seeing Junichiro and Tomo finally be happy together as a couple is just really delightful. That kiss made me stand up from my seat, cheer and put a huge smile on my face. Just really amazing to see. I absolutely think this is a great contender for romance of the year.\n\nCast was fantastic all throughout, I know this is Lexi Nieto's first big role but she really did so well as Tomo, and I know how much this role means to her, so she deserves so much praise for doing a character so much justice the same way Rie Takahashi did. Ricco was pretty good as Jun too, as well as Jad Saxton as Misuzu (best girl!). We also gotta give a lot of credit to Sally Amaki for flawlessly playing our sweet cotton candy airhead Carol in both the sub **AND** dub, even flying to Crunchyroll's studio in Texas where she gave it her all. A big thanks to Caitlin Glass for directing this wonderful series.",

The best part for me were the characters and the amount of screen time each of them had. Jun's character development/background was very good in this episode, specially Minute 9 when he talks with Tomo and 19 when he fights.\n\nIMO the best episode was the finale, with very good animation, comedy, and romance.\n\nFor me, this anime is about an 8.5, or that is what I would have said halfway through the episode, but the last minutes were AMAZING, so I'll leave it at 9 in my books.\n\nPD: Tomo best girl of the season for me.",

If they made a second season for the rest of the source material that would be amazing but they wrapped it up so well that if this was the end, I wouldn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re missing out. Whole cast did such a great job but Sally Amaki absolutely stole the show as Carol.",

With her performance It felt like Carol was ripped right out of the manga. I loved it in both the dub and sub. I really hope she pops up in more dubs in the future.",

It\u2019s been a joy watching this show from Mizuzu Best girl, to Carol\u2019s antics and Tomo and Jin\u2019s lovers quarrel\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d. So sad to see this end. That fight with Jun and Tomo\u2019s dad was awesome as was the kiss at the end of the episode. The studio adapting this did a great job on the show fr. Also that movie theater scene was funny as hell.\n\nAnother thing, the dub for this was fire, as per usual with CR\u2019s in-house dubs. Jax Saxton and Lexi Nieto were definitely my highlights with every dub episode. The script was excellent as well and funny as hell. Shoutout to the entire dub cast and crew for this, they did a fabulous job so hats off to them. All in all, this show was great and imma miss watching it every week.",

If I had one direct gripe about it, I wish Misaki was more involved. We see that last shot of the five of them together, but Misaki always seemed like he was never really around. Except the little arc he had that involved Carol anyway.",

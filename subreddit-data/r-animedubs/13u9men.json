Now halfway through the season, and my heart is bursting with the friends and memories she\u2019s gathered. From the side trip to the field trip. I just love seeing her, Takada, Adachi, and Hino just be good beans to each other. \n\nBut really, the best moment was the marinated eggs scene. That hit in the feels. Props to Akane\u2019s dad, and Alex Hom for such a tender reading. Loved it.",

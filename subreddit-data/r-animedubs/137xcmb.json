I'd think that after inventing the phone and automobiles, then nothing would surprise me anymore. I guess it's this show's charm that keeps me excited.\n\nSpeaking of excited, how about that ending? Now I'm even more interested in Dr. Stone than I've ever been before. One of the shows biggest mysteries finally revealing a small piece of the puzzle.",

Taiju finally figured out the joke 3700 years later LOL.\n\nThe whywhywhy at the end there was definitely a nice creep factor and Senku kinda shit talking them in the mic was badass.\n\nRandom side note- I know this isn't a romance but I hope Senku and Kohaku get together at the end. Just a cute couple imo despite Senku being married to science. I also know a little bit of what happens later so no spoilers please lol.",

She's doing an EXCELLENT job keeping the character androgynous--not giving them a male or a female bent, which is perfect as their gender is never stated.\n\nEdit: I just finished the episode and Senku's last line when he's talking to \"Why Man\" is just...it's PRODIGIOUS. Aaron did a GREAT job with that read!",

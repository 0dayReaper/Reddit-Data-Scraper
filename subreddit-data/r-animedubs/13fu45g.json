But it's been a year since I watched them, and I am scared I might forget some things. But I want to rewatch only some of the episodes again. What should I do if I need clarification? Should I Look at a Wiki article? Or do I need to rewatch them?",

Other than that I would probably start at the beginning because if you haven't hit a recap episode you're not that far into it",

Maybe watch a couple episodes before or skin through a synopsis.\n\nIf you're halfway through an arc, then maybe you could start it from the beginning if you're really worried. But honestly, if you have any questions or you think you've forgotten something, I'm sure a quick Google search will tell you all you need to know.",

Most popular shows have them and are usually only 10-20 minutes long when covering an entire season. If that doesn't work, then you could always read the episode summaries on Wikipedia.",

Like let\u2019s say you watched up until season 2, find a video on YouTube where someone recap/summarizes the anime from that point, you\u2019ll usually have good luck but might need to figure out where you left off on using a wiki ep guide or something.",

            "comment": "Damn, Morlock was packing heat. No wonder he got it on with that younger woman.\n\nHalf the episode was one long dick joke. At least 1 Maderaka long.\n\nFeel bad for Lafanpan. How would you feel if your height was one unit of kingly dick?\n\nHalf a kingly dick is apparently enough for Raelza, which is above average for an asian male. Raelza was probably considering getting her lock picked, and Saitou has the dex stat to back it up.\n\nOn a serious note, I assume the white wolf that traveled with the hellhound was the pup Raelza befriended when she was young, which makes me think the pup will be a new party member.",

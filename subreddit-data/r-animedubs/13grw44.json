Her tribe committed the high crime if just wanting to be left alone.\n\nI see a lot of comments about girl power and Genji's muhsoggyknees. I don't know if you guys saw him push Sagari out of the way before the giant dude scooped out part of his torso. I guess the equal opportunity equality option would've been to let her abdomen get a scoop, too. There's some credence to his criticisms. A giant hulking monster was able to get within inches of them and she froze up.\n\nlmao kama sutra statues.",

I get that she's supposed to come off as tomboyish, but her voice just sounds a bit too deep and makes her sound more like a mom or something. I feel like Dani Chambers with her Luca voice (from Vanitas; with a bit more expression) would've been a much better option.",

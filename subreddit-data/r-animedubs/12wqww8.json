He's been showing some decent character growth the past few episodes, and I think this is going to regress it.\n\nThe other Earth House kids are going to know Nika is a terrorist. I know most of the kids are probably going to be horrified, but I don't know how ChuChu is going to take it, since she's almost obnoxiously anti-Spacian.\n\nProspera gets mother of the year award. Let's eMoTiOnAl dAmAgE your daughter into equating moving forward with making human pancakes.\n\nSuletta is very cheery when making strawberry jam. Speaking of which, Miorine going all \"murderer!\" always annoys me in fiction. Bitch, that terrorist was going to murderize you and daddy. Suletta saved your ass by making finger paintings with him. Same holds with Suletta saying mommy murdered the terrorists, but Suletta is kind of a dummy, and is pretty emotionally compromised.\n\nThe scenes in Aerial's cockpit where the Gundam is seemingly talking to Suletta all but confirms that Aerial is some degree of sentient. If Eri and Suletta are two different people, it would clear up some of the seeming inconsistencies, like Suletta being far too young to be Eri taking the prologue timeskip into account.",

I guess Shaddiq is being used by the Bennerict Group to protect their interests which involved taking out Gund-Arm.\n\nThe end was surprising. Not that I was surprised that it happened (lots of idiots on the internet not aware of what spoilers are), but I was surprised that Suletta didn't react in any way. Look, it's a terrorist, trying to kill her (or at least her father), so morally speaking I don't see an issue. But Suletta's reaction to having blood on her hands (literally) was so nonchalant. I just can't see her not reacting to it, or anyone reacting to it. Miorine called her a murderer at the end, but she should be more worried about how she wasn't phased by it.",

Studying the source might help clarify some of the political mess in the story. Suletta is Miranda, Miorine is Ferdinand, Aerial is Ariel, Delling is the Duke of Milan, Prospera is Prospero, etc.\n\nI'm definitely having an easier time following the story because I'm familiar with the play. The adaptation gets looser the further the show gets, but cour 1 cover through act III-IV-ish. If you can find a decent production online, or even a decently detailed summary, it will probably help.",

Look, it's a terrorist, trying to kill her (or at least her father)\n\nIt was actually Miorine's father in that scene. I think Suletta reacted the way she did because, for some reason or another, her mental state can be heavily influenced by her mother. She was having a panic attack at the thought of her friends or herself being killed, or having to kill another person until her mother basically told her it was okay, and then she carried out the task with almost childlike innocence. It will be really interesting to see where the story takes her character development from here.",

So who is eri's mom then?For reason I was under the impression suletta was just older eri but was so confused why the mom looked different but they both had the arm prosthetic so i thought the mom just did some more prosthetic stuff that changed her appearance but of course they also act differently soo i was just confused the whole time",

If Suletta ends up being a clone of Eri, then biologically, Prospera would be her mother and Eri her sister. I think Aerial is Eri like you stated and somehow had her consciousness uploaded into the Gundam.",

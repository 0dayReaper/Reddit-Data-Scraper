Everyone who had voiced their characters in the Game are definitely assured to Voice them again in the Anime.\n\nMatthew Mercer Back as the Council and Amanda Celine Miller back as Jackass, those 2 are very big Union VA's and Thanks to the Union Magic of this Dub, They Back, so is Julie Ann Taylor (She's Not really full Union but she is most certainly back to play Emil again in the Anime. :)",

I'm shocked that there hasn't been any shots of them, even briefly, on the moon or wherever they are supposed to be hiding.",

Outside of being something for the game fans, I think it's also meant to intrigue anime-only viewers on what role those 2 red haired androids play.",

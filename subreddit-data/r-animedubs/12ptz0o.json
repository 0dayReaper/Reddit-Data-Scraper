But I also remember it being unapologetically the definition of the power fantasy harem isekai. Like, shit, dude's got 4 fiancees. Or 9? I'm a little confused there. Probably should have rewatched the first season since I remember sweet fa, but then, with the VA changes, maybe it's best I didn't since I literally can't remember what any of them sounded like. \n\nAnywho, I do remember enjoying the show well enough so I'll definitely be watching this (though maybe do it waiting a few weeks in between at a time), and with the line \"don't worry, a mysterious steam cloud will conceal my naughty bits\" I sort of remember why XD I do enjoy shows that are so cliched that they're a blatant parody now and then.",

Touya could just set a Gate on the floor that teleported directly above, sending someone into a Portal like endless loop of hell.\n\nI'm confused. At the time of the end of season 1, he only had four fiances. But he's talking to god and they definitely mention nine. I know there will be nine eventually, but they implied that it was already the case. Also, I swear I don't remember the new goddess girl who of course is played by Jamie Marchi.  And in the next scene, the girls clarify there's only four of them. Also, how does everyone other than Elze and Touya know Excel? Isn't it a non-elemental spell that can't be learned? \n\nI was certainly right that Celeste Perez is a great voice match for Felecia Angelle. Couldn't pinpoint Alison Viktorin's replacement, but they also sounded good.",

I was thinking of Jamukha Blau who has Accel (I'm an idiot again). Which is even more suspicious. If I recall, you can't teach null magic to others. The entire gang does at the beginning. Unless Touya's ability allows him to teach null magic to others, but that never came up previously.",

It's common for women to voice male characters, but for some people who have transitioned it may not be their preference to voice characters with their old gender.

If they have to replace voice actors, they could at least try to pay attention to the target ages a little...\n\nI'm disappointed in Touya's new VA because it's clear from this episodes instances of his flustered reactions that he doesn't have the same range as the original VA for those moments.  I honestly felt Touya's season 1 English VA did a better job than the Japanese VA whenever he was doing duty as the foil for Leen's teasing or whatever.",

As the fianc\u00e9s are explaining what made them fall for Touya I\u2019m sitting there confused, saying \u201cWhen did that happen?\u201d\n\nThe especially horny Cesca voiced by the one and only Brittany Karbowski was the highlight.\n\nAgain I\u2019ll probably keep following it as a fan of Bryson and the fact there actually seems to story to this season.",

Right off the bat, when Touya is asked why he doesn't have his fiances on his smartphone's homepage, ***his answer specifically references NINE fiances***, which the Japanese dialogue did not.\n\nI believe it is very _safe_ to assume that he does _not_ have nine fiances at this point, having not even added that many to his party yet, let alone had the topic of engagement broached.\n\nWhoever is in charge of the scripts for the dub of this show needs to be brought under control.

They produced two Japanese audio tracks, one of which was censored here and there, and that's what Crunchyroll worked from?\n\nLet me give you a quick example of what I'm getting at.  Episode 10, at about 15:50.  One of those brief interlude scenes the series has a penchant for, depicting Linze creating a large-breasted sand sculpture around the half-buried Elze.\n\n**Japanese:** \u5927\u304d\u304f\u306a\uff5e\u308c\uff01  (Subbed as: May you grow bigger.)  \n**English:** Here you go!  Though you're perfect the way you are.\n\nThe point of this change, of course, was that somebody on the translating team was uncomfortable with the scene and decided to inject their values into it, at the expense of faithfulness to the source material.\n\nIf I'm following you correctly, this was pre-censored in some unelaborated way?\n\n---\n\n_Edit: To reply to the \"deleted / unavailable\" account which is not in fact deleted or unavailable:_\n\n&gt; Besides, there's hardly any significant difference between the two versions of the quote.\n\nIf you believe there isn't any point in staying as close to the original dialogue as possible, even in a dub, then I'm hardly going to be the person who changes your mind.  Enjoy those dubs from the 80s and 90s.  Me?  I'm glad the majority of the modern dubbing industry is being held to a higher standard.",

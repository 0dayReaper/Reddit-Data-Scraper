Curious what it can do.\n\nI do like this game world they've created. You see it well in this episode. You pick a class, starting stats, but you're free to do pretty much whatever and grow in anyway. Doesn't seem to be a main line quest you have to power through. It's just an open world and you can find different skills and abilities based on just where you go.",

Hopefully it can help Sally get over her fear of ghosts.\n* Meanwhile, Iz's pet is just a [MarineAngemon](https://digimon.fandom.com/wiki/MarineAngemon) knockoff...",

It\u2019s supposed to be _her_ quest, but she was just gathering while Maple and Mii did the work. Everyone else earned their summon creatures on their own power. If Iz is the equivalent of the Chemist job in _Final Fantasy,_ she should be learning some attack Mix recipes to go with her admittedly superior restoring/buffing potions.",

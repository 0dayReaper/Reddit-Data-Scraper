            "comment": "Def loved this episode, was a lot of fun. And Marissa bringing out the most fun with the dialogue is just one of the reasons why i believe she's a pawfect casting for Yuna.\n\nWhile I do love the bear puns, the sillies, and the over-the-top corny aspects of the show (like Fina's magical girl transformation, the horror of staying with the high class Foschuroses, and the \"BO BO BOZO RANGERS\", what part of me really loved seeing is a little more Yuna/Fina focused ep.\n\nAs much as it's about a bear having a BEARY amazing time in this virtual game, one of it's charms that made me love the show was the familial and found-family themes. I love Yuna and Fina's relationship. I love how Yuna protects Fina and how she wants nothing but the best for her. And I'm sure Fina appreciates Yuna going above beyond for her over a harvesting knife. Even if all of this does sound like more trouble than it's worth.",

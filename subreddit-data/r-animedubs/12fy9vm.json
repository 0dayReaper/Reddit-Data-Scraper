            "comment": "I found S2 just as enjoyable as S1. Plenty of adorable moments with Nagatoro and Senpai. Loved the zoo, skiing, judo, and the aquarium date. Loved seeing Nagatoro bring Senpai more out if his shell, and loved seeing Senpai stand up for himself and Nagatoro too. \n\nGreat show. Kimberley Anne Campbell and Erik Kimerer always make each episode so much fun. And great work by the supporting cast too.",

            "comment": "&gt;!Yoshi!&lt; was the MVP of this finale. &gt;!Seeing a character who mainly just makes comedic one liners (I say that lovingly, she makes me piss myself laughing like all the time) have a legit moment was super cool to see.!&lt; Also loved seeing Sakura come back, was worried the show forgot about her lol. And the ending credits scene was sweet and lovely.\n\nAll in all this was a fantastic season. This English dub in particular is one of the best I've heard for any anime, and personally, hearing them speak in my own language and much like the girls *I* knew in high school probably enhanced the experience for me.\n\nAs the manga is still apparently ongoing, I sincerely hope we get a third season and I pray this amazing and talented voice cast (especially Kimberley, Erik, and Brittany) all come back to continue voicing these lovable characters for a third dub.",

    "postText": "I just started watching Detective Conan/Case closed. \n\nNow when I was finding fillers i got a wierd problem- the filler episodes' name and my downloaded anime's name and episode number were mismatched. \n\nAfter a bit of research i found out that funimation renamed the series as 'Case closed' and released it.\n\nSo now my question is is there any difference between two versions of the show? \n\nAnd how much is dubbed of the show? \n\nAnd Anilist says the latest episode is 1081, which one is Anilist counting? Detective Conan or case closed?",

            "comment": "*Detective Conan* is the original, most widely-recognized title *outside of US*. The US version changed it to *Case Closed* to avoid copyright with *Conan the Barbarian*.\n\nThe new dubbed episodes on Tubi uses the original title at the start of every episode (\"Always in search of the truth with the body of a child and the mind of an adult, Detective Conan\"). The first dub covers Japanese episodes 1-123 (some one-hour specials were split into two parts, making it 130 eps for the dub instead of 123) and the second dub covers episodes 965-1014 as of now.",

Physical sales were good and that's why they continued with the movies and kept re-releasing the volumes like the Viridian Collection Box Set after they stopped dubbing the series. Case Closed was doing well enough for Funi to buy the streaming rights for the episodes till a few years ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's just that the old execs were only interested in Case Closed making 4Kidz numbers on TV and didn't bother much about sales. That being said, it was doing only normal physical numbers, if it did crazy good maybe it would still be around today.",

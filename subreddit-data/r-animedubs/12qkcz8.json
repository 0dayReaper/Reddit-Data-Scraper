            "comment": "*fuck cbr.com\n\nBut yes. For me, my opinion on a handful of minor characters in One Piece has been significantly raised because of the dub. Specifically, The Yeti Cool Brothers of Punk Hazard, Machvise of the Doflamingo Family, and Perospero of the Big Mom Pirates. I hated/could not care about these characters in the manga and subbed anime. But the funimation dub brought them to life with hilarious dialogue. Completely changed how i felt, and now I absolutely love these characters. They always make me laugh when they are on screen",

I haven't watched any of it in Japanese, but from what I hear, he comes across as a loud, unhinged maniac in the original while Austin tindle's performance turns im more into a composed psychopath.

Going from, \"Come on,\" in the sub, to \"FUCKING DIE ALREADY!\"  During a certain scene with Shinji, the sub is a pretty cliche, \"I will keep you safe,\" but the dub goes, \"Well, if you're not going to do it, might as well be somewhere safe,\" vibe.

Like with native English speakers, despite what people want to claim, we use a lot of \u201ccurse\u201d words naturally in our daily dialogue. We use them to emphasize things a lot of the time, and with languages like  Japanese the emphasis are made in other ways that don\u2019t translate to subtitles correctly. Think of it like tonal usage, we know the tones for mad, sad, angry, sarcastic, etc in English without any thought, but majority of us aren\u2019t going to so easily pick up on those things in another language even if we know the language. Those are just things you pick up over time passively.",

The lines were pretty much the same, but just the absolutely done with everyone's shit of the performance just sold me on it more. \n\nSomething i did enjoy in both versions was Nichijou. In that, the professor sounds more like a bratty kid in the dub while in the sub she is more of a cute clumsy kind. I don't know how intentional it was, but it makes me see her differently and that was the biggest difference between versions. \n\nIt can be that it is easier to pick up certain things dubbed vs subbed, but other times it is just a different take. For example, Yami Bakura is very deep and serious in Yugioh dub while in Japanese it is more deranged due to having a higher shrillier voice. \n\nThose are just in performance, not any major differences (like abridged series). In those, of course you see characters different with how the writing and jokes takes characters in vastly different directions. \n\nComing back to Saiki K, I think that kind of character just can't be enjoyable to me in Japanese. Tanaka-kun is Always Listless is something I knew I could enjoy more but just couldn't and I think this is the reason. An English performance like with Saiki could be what makes it click more for me.",

Everybody I've talked to who got exposed to Sub Goku via Super had interesting things to say regarding her take on Black.\n\nHave you seen Digimon Tamers or Savers/Data Squad subbed? Because she does Guilmon and Gallantmon/Dukemon in those and its a completely different take from the English dub as well.",

I found old Frieza more into intimidating (yes it was obvious he was a old lady n partly why we thought he was a lady, but it fits him lol) as well as why I don't even like Kai because of the redubs n how corny they can be at times.\n\nAlso, like when season 1 gets dubbed by one studio, then season 2 by another. Although, that's not always the case, like Teasing Master Takagi-san, I love both dubs equally n it doesn't bother me to hear different voices for them. \n\nSome characters I like waay more too, because I'll have a bias towards their VA, like anytime Cherami Leigh voices a character lol. Although, I prolly would like those characters regardless, n sometimes I like them before she gets casted, but she's my favorite VA, so it does play a role. However, writing is still number one reason why I see a character a certain way, but performances do matter a lot",

That whole dub was a masterclass that was a decade ahead of its time, and I think Sabat was the lynchpin that held it all together.",

            "comment": "To answer the title question: Yes.\n\nThe only reason I like DanMachi at all is because of the dub. I watched the entire first season subbed (way before it looked like Sentai would *ever* dub it) and thought the whole thing was mediocre at best. A large part of why I couldn't get into the series is because Japanese Hestia feels like nothing more than a whiny, entitled brat. *To be fair,* that is one aspect of her character, it's legitimate to portray her that way at times.\n\nThen when the dub came out I watched an episode, intending just to get a taste for how it turned out, and I was surprisingly hooked. Over-all, the dub is fantastic, with some really great performances from not only main characters but side characters, too.\n\nBlocker's super-natural-sounding best-girl Eina was fantastic, she has such a unique portrayal that is like the polar opposite of the sharp enunciation and character performance I normally associate with voice acting, she just sounds like a real person and I mean that in the best of ways.\n\nBaugus' Bell is wonderful. He's got just the right amount of plucky can-do optimism tinged with lingering self-doubt and confidence issues. Haag's Lili is great, and her dynamic with the exceptional teasing Wald as Welf would be good enough to be the main characters in their own series. Simmons' Ryuu plays to the actress' strengths as a stoic-maybe-even-to-the-point-of-being-aloof archetype. I could list damn-near every VA for this series and have something positive to say about them.\n\nAnd then there's Christian's Hestia, which is phenomenal. Yes, she can still be the same bratty, tiny goddess, but then she *also* has the flecks of maturity and sincerity that are absolutely vital to *really* selling the character, to portraying her as the literal god that she is, and not just as a thirsty joke always demanding Bell's attention. She's *so good*.\n\nThe dub for this series turned it from something I thought was \"mid\" into one of my favorite fantasy action/adventure series. I now own the Collector's Edition releases for all three seasons and the side-series spin-off Sword Oratoria, *and* got into the novels, all because of the dub adding so much to the characters that I was able to see them for far more than just a collection of their obvious traits and roles.",

That's not just exclusive to dubs, that's just the way adaptations work.",

            "comment": "The different voice performances can definitely change how we view characters, not just because of changes in script but also the tone of voice and the emotion the actors put into a scene. \n\nI watched the English dub of DBZ on Toonami when I was a kid and that was the only version I knew - I didn't see any video clips of the original Japanese voice acting until much later, and I was surprised by how different Goku sounded. He always had an innocent, playful side even in the English dub but still came across as very strong, both physically and in spirit. His Japanese voice sounded so silly to me though, I'm not sure I would've had the same impression of his character if I had watched the Japanese version instead. \n\nFor an example of \"different but not better/worse\", I've noticed that the Spanish dub of Sword Art Online often makes the dialogue between couples more romantic and the dialogue between friends more playful/humorous. I really liked both versions and think it's just a matter of being adapted to fit the culture, as Kirito's lines translated literally might come off as sounding too reserved. \n\nOn the other hand, More Than A Married Couple's dub actually gave me a worse impression of the main girl. She sounded too mean-spirited and almost made me drop the show, but I ended up switching to the sub instead. I still didn't like her character, but I think the Japanese voice acting better portrayed her personality. \n\nThe point in the article about bilingual characters like Asuka from Evangelion actually being shown speaking their second language in the dub was really interesting! I liked the scene from Saving 80,000 Gold where Mitsuha spoke Spanish to try out her new translation ability, so it would be nice to see more scenes like that.",

            "comment": "Abso-fucking-lutely. \n\nThere are few dubs out there superior to the original audio, imo a huge part of it matters based on where the anime is actually taking place. Is it in Japan? Europe/western based?etc. That has a big impact on whether or not it *feels* right. That's not the end all be all though, but it does make an impact. \n\nThe main difference however is probably just budget. A dub of a non-mainstream anime probably will have a small budget, and probably be pretty bad outside of a few gems. Take a show like gintama - there are *so* many characters, and it's not that popular in the west. Thus, not much effort goes into casting actors with a similar tone/vibe and instead just casts to fill roles. The dub is *awful* in comparison to the sub. Like, the characters give off completely different vibes and honestly would provide a vastly different viewing experience. \n\nAnother example is spy family. It's not a bad dub, however the main character, Anya, sounds *nothing* like she does in the sub. That's not a good thing. You would see anyas character differently if you watched the dub first. \n\nBut you do have rare cases like kill la kill, which imo has a fucking *incredible* dub that's better than the sub. Monster is another one imo (plus even tho mc is Japanese it takes place in the western side of the world). You have shows like hunter x hunter, where hisokas dub va did such a fucking incredible job that it actually raises the entire value of the dub a lot. Meruem also had a fitting and incredible dub voice (actually most of the characters were fantastic). \n\nSo it really does just depend. Budget matters but also voice actors who actually *study* the material matter. Those who make an effort to match the tone and make sure to not give off a different vibe.",

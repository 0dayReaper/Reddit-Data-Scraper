            "comment": "\"Cuteness conquers all\" would be a good subtitle for this series. \ud83d\ude04 Kumayuru and Kumakyu steal the show.\n\nWatching the teacher try so hard not to call her a bear was great, though I'm a bit disappointed they changed the line where Yuna called herself a bear. I like how the new group of kids have varied, fairly well-developed personalities even though they've only been around for a short time. Cattleya's voice in the dub really suits her, Timol's was somewhat deeper than I was expecting but it does fit well enough, and Maricks' voice reminds me very much of Damian from Spy x Family but that might partly be his attitude. Any news on who plays him?",

However, for the 99th sacrifice, the human girl brought to the capital, Sariphi, intrigues the Beast King.*  \n*In fact, she isn't afraid of him or any other beast and even accepts her death without begging or crying, as she has neither home nor family to return to if she were released. The King finds her intriguing and let her stay at his side as his consort despite being human. This is the story of how Sariphi will become the queen of demons and beasts.*",

            "comment": "Sariphi is just too pure for this world and must be protected at all costs. She's kind to both beast creatures and humans, despite both fearing who she is and what she might bring to their own kind.\n\nI love the \"outcasts finding love\" trope. In a kingdom where neither can find true acceptance, Sariphi and Leo find what they want the most in each other. And i love the feelsies that come with it.\n\nAnd can we get Ray Hurd to play more deep voiced pretty anime boys please? I'm always glad when they give VAs who have rarely or never had a lead a chance at the spotlight. And hearing Ray as Leo lets me hear a side of him that I don't hear too often with the roles he's usually cast as.  I love it.\n\nAfter 3 eps, def gonna stick around. One last point, I see Anubis going down one of two paths: Either he's going to do plot the death or banishment of Sariphi to protect what he thinks is the kingdom's best interest only to get brutally murdered by Leo, OR when Saraiphi gets in trouble and Leo can't save her, he'll be the one that ends up protecting Saraphi in the end realizing how much he has grown to care for her, despite her being an adorable nusiance. *(\"it's not like I protected you for you or anything. It's all for his Majesty's best interest, human!\")*",

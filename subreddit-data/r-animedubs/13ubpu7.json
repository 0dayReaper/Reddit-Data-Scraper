He seems to actually care about Suletta now. Same as Miorine I guess, but she's absolutely terrible at showing it.\n\nWonder how the duel is going to be counted, since it looked like Miorine admitted over open comms that she rigged it. Hell, I wonder how that's going to affect Guel. Poor guy already suffered an inferiority complex and PTSD. How's it going to affect him knowing he only beat Suletta because of cheating. I think it's implied he was in on the plan, if only partially, but man.",

That it will cause Suletta to be more susceptible to someone's influence especially if her mother uses it to her advantage. Though I doubt in the end she will abandon Miorine. Something will cause her to fight on her choice, and merit.",

A Line Said directly by Aerial\n\n&gt; No.  \n&gt; No, Mom.  \n&gt; I don't mind going, but not Suletta. She's such a good girl.  \n&gt; If you want revenge, you and I can do it ourselves. Just keep her out of this.  \n&gt; But Mom can't hear my voice.\n\nA**eri**al is so protective of her sister that she wants her to be Safe and away from all of the scheming and Fighting, even If it Breaks her Heart. Just Like Miorine\n\nSide Note: Elan5 should be *very* Happy that Guel showed Up. If He Had succeded in whatever His plan was to get Aerial then Eri would have propably completly Fried him with 0 remorse",

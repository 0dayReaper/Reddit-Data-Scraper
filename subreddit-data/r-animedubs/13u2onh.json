    "postText": "Has anyone heard anything about the release of Season 2 Blurays in the West?  It's been over 2 years since season 2 ended and nothing.\n\nIt's a Kadokawa show and Kadokawa shows are still being released on Bluray by Crunchyroll/Funimation (Shield Hero Season 2, Mushoku Tensei, Devil is a part-timer), so I doubt it's a falling out.\n\nIs the show just so popular in Japan that they are worried about reverse importation 2 years after it ended?\n\nDid the fiasco with the video quality of the fist part of season 1 leave a bad taste in someone's mouth?\n\nIt would at least be cool if they made a director's cut of season 2 like they did with season 1 so we could get a version with more added and improved animation.",

I think ID:INVADED was such a time.\n\nUnless dates get moved forward, I think we might be looking at an announcement for June for the September slate.\n\n&gt;Even says \"Complete Season 2\"...when they love to split 2 cours shows into 2 parts\n\nYeah, I suppose it might compensate for the long wait. It is worth noting that even though it got split into 2 parts as a release, Steins;Gate 0 Part 1 and 2 ended up releasing on the same day. I guess they didn't want to do that again lol.",

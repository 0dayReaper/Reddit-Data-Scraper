It's not for everyone, ep 1-6 is very hard to watch because, based on the point of view you take, it can be considered as a pedo. But passed that, for me, it's my top pick for anime though. It has god-tier animation, attention to detail, best world building I have seen (out of 300+ anime ) same for character development, never seen anything close to this, and creative way of using the opening for putting you in the mood before starting the episode(not going to spoil what they do but every opening is unique and should NOT be skipped). Animators seem to have fun making it. I just cannot advise it without warning :)",

Also, if you like slice-of-life with a bit of Supernatural involved, Fruits Basket it a really good one and had me tearing up a lot during watching the episodes. I also recommend Spy x Family as well, because I LOVE Anya. That's it I guess for recommendations. Sorry if there weren't that many.",

One of my favorites is Michelle Knotz as Jessie, the pompous, flamboyant energy I hear in Jessie's voice, is phenomenal. What's your favorite performance from the English dub of the Pokemon anime?",

It hasn't been 4kds in over a decade.  \n\nThe biggest standout to me is Eric Stuart as James, he really defined the characters personalitiy, maybe even beyond the text itself. Ted Lewis as Giovanni, especially in the earlier seasons when the character was written more straight, captured the right menacing tone. Lastly, Philipp Bartlett as Mewtwo, no other Mewtwo voice has come close.",

I would say Paul in general is a really fascinating character and might be Ash best rival and the performance amplified it. Stole each scene, etc. So yeah...he's one of the highlights for me.",

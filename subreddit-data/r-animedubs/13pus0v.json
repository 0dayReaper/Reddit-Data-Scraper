Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not bad, I just struggle with subtitles and context with an unfamiliar language. Like if I was fluent in Japanese I would be watching sub instead. I just prefer to hear it in my own language at the end of the day\n\nBut yes, I\u2019m really pumped for the 1000th episode, it\u2019s going to be hype (for us who haven\u2019t seen it)!!",

I\u2019m excited to hear Robbie Daymond and Sean Hannigan especially in these coming episodes and who they decided to cast for Toki. Also how they ended up translating the Oden song. \n\nAnd I\u2019m assuming based on [Colleen](https://twitter.com/ccarrollbeard/status/1658859722097803265?s=46&amp;t=tcMTzkwifnqQt6rCHNRarw) and [David\u2019s](https://twitter.com/volobos/status/1658872689988337664?s=46&amp;t=tcMTzkwifnqQt6rCHNRarw) tweets that they are recording as far as Ep 1015 right now but it\u2019s not as definitive as tweets prior letting us know they are recording Ep 1000. They are definitely in the 1000s though so it makes sense. \n\nMan we are so close to some crazy episodes and we are like two sets away from being in the same section as the JP broadcast. Can never stress how far the ADR team has come.",

It's more that it's still being uploaded to a streaming service afterwards that's meant to be shuttered because higher-ups seemingly can't be bothered to update outdated contracts for their licensors. Just hurts the dub's visibility, promotion opportunities, and legal accessibility.",

There have been 7 times where instead of a new episode, One Piece aired a special recap episode. The episodes still had the opening and in streaming services like Funimation and Crunchyroll they are placed in episode order like all the rest but are not numbered. So, if they just dub these recaps and treat them like normal episodes during the releases then we are currently more like 105 episodes behind. If they just skip those and only do the actual numbered episodes then we are 98 episodes behind.\n\nI am really hoping that they skip those recaps and just include them on the DVDs. I really don't want to have a batch of 12 dub episodes released but in actuality two of those are just recaps. I'd also hate for them to be treated as an episode on the DVDs and have them pop up like a normal episode during Marathon Mode.",

Don't hold your breath, everyone is dragging their feet as far as the libraries are concerned.  \n\nI'd anticipate at least another year, at best, before we see Crunchyroll absorb the full Funi library and Funimation go derelict.  I hate it though, because Crunchyroll doesn't have an app on my TV, and that's how I watch Funi stuff right now.",

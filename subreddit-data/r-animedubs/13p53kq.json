I'm willing to bet the original guy will be back next episode since episode 7 had Ketil replaced for some unknown reason, but still, always odd.\n\nThat would make three times now that we've had an actor randomly replaced for a single episode (not counting Olmar since he was fully recast w/ an announcement and everything). E6 had a different Thorfinn (presumably because they were working out how to handle Mike), E7 had a different Ketil, and now E18 has a different Thorgil.",

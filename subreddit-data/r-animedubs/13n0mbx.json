    "postText": " [Disney Plus, Hulu Removing Dozens of Titles Including Willow, Dollface - Variety](https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/disney-plus-hulu-content-removed-willow-dollface-1235618280/) \n\nI've been paying very close attention to this news recently that these shows will be removed from Disney+ and Hulu starting next week. It really sucks that they're just going to disappear in a flash, and I do hope that they'll be available via other distribution methods but that made me start to wonder about another thing that's been bothering me this season.\n\nI wonder if inevitably, Disney is going to pull the few anime they do have on their service and license them off to other services? That Funi/CR deal made with Hulu prior to the Disney/Fox merger in 2018 is likely setting to expire soon, and we're seeing Disney's CEO, Bob Iger reverse most, if not all of Bob Chapek's business decisions regarding D+, which may eventually lead to aborting their plans to acquire anime to grow the service in Japan, or at the very least, sublicense shows to other companies.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if in the next wave of removals of content from D+, that shows like Summertime Rendering and Tokyo Revengers s2 are considered for the chopping block.",

Might be in 2 years, might be in 20 years. It might be announced a head of time, it could disappear overnight. Nothing on streaming is forever. \n\nEven originals have licencing deals and recurring royalties.",

Disney+ in the EU and Asia has shows like The Walking Dead along with other anime and later this year Disney+ will be the exclusive streaming service for Doctor Who all around the world.  If anything I see more anime coming to Disney+ in the coming years.   Disney+ Japan already has a small library.",

A lot of those decisions that were made with the service (like Doctor Who and anime) were done by his predecessor Bob Chapek in an attempt to achieve growth at any costs through \"general entertainment\" and Iger is going to reverse all of his decisions. They aren't going to expend more money if they're focusing on cutting costs for Disney+ this year (and prioritizing on buying the remainder of Comcast's stock in Hulu next year).",

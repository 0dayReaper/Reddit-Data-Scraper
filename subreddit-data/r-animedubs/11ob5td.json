    "postText": "For those that have read the manwha who do you think would fit dubbing Sung Jinwoo (technically his name will be Shun Mizushino because Japan want to change everything because they are seen as bad people in the manwha which is ridiculous imo and disrespectful to the author and illustrator rip) \n\nPersonally I feel people like Alejandro Saab who voiced  Tatsuya Shiba in irregular at a magic highschool would go pretty well as I think the mc becomes more deadpan in terms of response and more level headed as he becomes stronger and knows nothing will stand against him and his confidence to overcome people stronger then him will go well with his voice \n\nI would have said Billy kametz (he voiced naofumi iwatani  in rise of the shield hero also my favourite English male voice actor) but sadly he passed away from cancer last year.\n\nWho do you guys/girls think will voice him if it gets a dub",

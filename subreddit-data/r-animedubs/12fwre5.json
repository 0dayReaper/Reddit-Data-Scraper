The problem with that is that game localizations ***SUUUUCK*** and this is multiplied by 2x whenever 8-4 is involved.\n\nAnime dubs, of course, set a high standard.  I'm not going to be able to stop laughing at the contrast between hearing Nier Automata dubbed well and remembering how shitty and needlessly inaccurate the game localization was.",

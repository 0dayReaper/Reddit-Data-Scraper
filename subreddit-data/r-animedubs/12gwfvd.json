We already knew she was dirty since she was helping Shaddiq, but I didn't think it would go that far. Speaking of Shaddiq, him going full scorched earth on Bennerit seems absolutely retarded. This is going to be a repeat of the self-implosion when he tried to bully Miorine, writ large when he kicks off a war.",

She has done a lot for Suletta after all.\n\nIt was not just one or two small things, it was the piling up of a lot of small things(and a few big things in her mind). Suletta is very neurodivergent coded (whether it's closer to ADHD or autism is up for debate.) One thing that can accompany that is called rejection sensitivity dysphoria. As a simplified explanation Suletta ties her self worth by what other people think of her (this is different than narcissism). At the start of the episode she's the only pilot for GundARM that can use the Gund format, the company that employs all of her friends 100% needs her specifically. Miorine is counting on her to take care of her tomatoes (an extremely important task for something Miorine values **greatly**), not to mention she's Miorine's groom. She has so much value, so much!         \n         \nThen the first crack in the armor was Ojelo joking that Miorine will throw them all out when she's done. Then Creeper Elan saying Miorine doesn't care for Suletta as a groom and only cares about her as a shield. Okay, okay, she's still got it together, it's okay, Miorine still needs Suletta to do stuff for her. Time for Suletta to take care of the Very Important Tomatoes that Miorine 'had no one else to ask except me!'. Wait, who are these two randos that Miorine asked to take care of the Very Important Tomatoes? Miorine then tells Suletta she's not needed for the Very Important Tomatoes ('You said this was important to you. I thought you were depending on me'). And then she's not needed to be the test pilot ('A company should have more than one tester, don't you think? Now I won't need to keep asking you to do anything.').           \n\n'Are you saying I don't need to be here anymore?'          \n'I guess so'          \n'I see now, that makes sense. It's my fault, I let myself get carried away' (aka, she let herself think she was valued by the people she cared about)           \n            \nAnd thus our favorite tanuki fell into the dysphoria hole.",

Hopefully he can get cast as future anime antagonists.\n* Of course they do the \"character drops item they were going to give someone\" trope...\n* Oh please tell me that tease at the end means that giant prick from the prologue finally gets his comeuppance soon...\n* Holy hell that post-credits scene. Shit's going to go down soon. And it looks like douchebag ex-groom is finally humbled and might get a chance to redeem himself.",

Your description honestly doesn't sound like *Angel Beats!* at all to me.\n\nIn a weird coincidence, I had a chat just yesterday with someone describing a very similar premise, and they told me the show was called ***Angels of Death***. I haven't seen it, so this is a bit of a long shot, but it definitely sounds similar.\n\nIn *Angel Beats!*, &gt;!one of the main female characters has indeed received a heart transplant from the male lead, who has since died. But I've seen the show several times, and I'm 99 % sure there is no scene with her waking up in a hospital. She only finds out about him being the organ donor when she talks to him in the afterlife/purgatory at the very end of the series.!&lt;",

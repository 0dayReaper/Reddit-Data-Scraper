    "postText": "With the dub having caught up to the finale of Journeys and currently on 'Aim to be a Pokemon Masters' (at least in Canada with the dub for the final half in the US being on June 23rd while APM is unknown but shouldn't be too far) and Pokemon Horizons being new and ongoing as of episode 9, I thought it would be good to ask what your predictions for the casting of the Horizons characters are plus future characters from Pokemon SV like Nemona and Brassius so far.\n\nJourneys is the first Pokemon series to be cross regional with dubbing in New York and California (though not the first to feature outside New York talent such as in the films featuring Keldeo and Diancie for instance plus Todd Habercorn in XY) so it could vary. The only people I had in mind for a character thus far is Max Mittelman or Robbie Daymond as Friede as Friede is a confident type of character that I could see the Max or Robbie playing as but that's my headcanon.\n\nWhat about you guys?",

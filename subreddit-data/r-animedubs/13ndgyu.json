From the mostly on time release posts for new episodes, to Q&amp;A's, and especially for the Dub Release calender. I love this community and appreciate everyone in it.

So the community is pretty small, which is partly why it's a lot nicer than other communities.",

It's bad enough their \"new anime news\" posts are just an image and sometimes a link that goes to a Japanese website. For fuck's sake, wait five seconds for ANN or MAL to have the article up. it's honestly amazing that SO many people put up with that trash. It's not ever about preference. It's just one big giant ass echo chamber.",

Everyone in the comments were like \"omg it's gonna suck so bad loooooool\", one guy commented that it doesn't really matter cause most people are just reading the same translation instead of listening to it anyway.

Basically, there was a scene where  Maple was getting interviewed, and in the Sub, there was a sex joke, while in the Dub, there wasn't. \n\nSo people immediately declared the Dub was \"censoring the original,\" and the writers and VAs for the Dub were harassed over it. \n\nBut then it later turned out that the Japanese dialogue didn't have the sex joke either, and it was something the Sub localiser added. \n\nWhich just proves that if you take away the subtitles, then those \"Sub Purists\" have no clue what's going on.",

            "comment": "I don't know if it's just me or not, but has Sentai really stepped up this past season with their dubs?  Maybe it just might be they got a really nice draw on dubs they were greenlighted to do. \n\nThis is just my opinion on the ones I've been watching, but The dubs I've been watching from Sentai have been **Eminence in Shadow** (which I thought was gonna be some harem power fantasy trash, but it's a lot more complex, interesting, and hammy that I expected), **Akiba Maid War** (an all-time Sentai dub), and **Urusei Yatsura** (not even 5 eps in and I think it's one of the funniest Sentai has ever dubbed), and of course, **Reincarnated as a Sword** (which I really, really enjoyed). All of them, I'm always looking forward to watch every week. And this past season in particular, I felt like I've had much more fun watching Sentai dubs than previous.\n\nAll show long, i was cheering for Fran. I loved her character. She was so endearing, so adorable, and a fun underdog (or cat) to cheer for. I loved seeing her get stronger and with each new skill and spell learned, and for each monster she defeated. I also loved when she just gets to be a child and a cat with the food and fun. I think my favorite parts of the show was when Fran and Teacher went up against the two dungeon bosses. Both pushing Fran and Teacher to their limits and finding ways to fight, rescue, and win.\n\nSpeaking of Teacher, he was also fun and interesting as well. Him meeting up with Fran was the best thing to happen to him. I love how caring he is, but explosive to protect her when she's in danger. He was also fun too, I loved the dialogue the ADR Writers gave him. And I enjoyed it when he gets to ham it up as well.\n\nLastly, I think my 3rd fave character in this was Amanda. A little bit of a back end addition, but I loved how she was the mother and protector to Fran. Even her overdoting on Fran was homey and wholesome. Loved her even more with that last episode and her connection to Fran's parents before they past. \n\nI see that it got confirmed for an S2! I'm excited for it! It was a blast and I'm so glad I stuck with it. Def one of the more enjoyable isekais for as saturated as that genre is.",

Too many of these Isekais feel like they jump the shark with their last few episodes, but this was satisfying, revealed a lot, and left plenty of room for future seasons to do more cool story.\n\nWas kinda hoping she'd manage to defeat the spider on her own without any help, but close enough.",

Fran is a great combination of endearing, silly, and just straight up true neutral. Teacher is fairly self-aware, and you can see it in this episode that he is very protective of Fran, going so far as to try to sub vert the trope of combatants showing any skin. Amanda even had some of the best moments, especially the emotional ones. I hope we see her more moving on, since she doesn't seem to be traveling.",

I'm listening to  **more&lt;STRONGLY** as I type this, to honor her. Absolutely a fantastic ED of a fantastic show. Thank you Maon-san for creating and sharing your music, you'll always be one of the best anime singers. May your memory and legacy be eternal.

In case you missed it, [HIDIVE announced they'll be at Anime Boston](https://twitter.com/HIDIVEofficial/status/1636097440771104775), there, they'll most certainly announce what shows will they dub from winter, and maybe spring titles or even backlog shows.

I wish him luck on his retirement and that he beats cancer.\n\nI\u2019m curious if James Carter Cathcart was able to do James, Meowth and Professor Oak for the 11 episodes from the miniseries special, \"Pok\u00e9mon: Aim to Be a Pok\u00e9mon Master\" in English before his announcement and retirement.",

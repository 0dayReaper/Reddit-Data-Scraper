Getting Hogwarts vibes from the classes (with the instructor randomly dolling out points). Erica, Kayli, and everyone we're great as usual.\n\nAlso, he only had a few lines, but It was nice to hear Arnie narrating.",

High expectations are/were an understatement. \n\nI laughed multiple times.  I got chills at the end of the episode watching megumin yell EXPLOSION!  \n\nI truly cannot believe this show exists.

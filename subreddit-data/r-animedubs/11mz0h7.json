Normally happens for the shows getting weekly releases in Japan, a good example being the Shaman King remake. The only weird thing here is that they are even releasing  the dub worldwide before the season ends. Honestly wasn't expecting that. But once the first episode came out earlier today with credits in the first 4 episodes, I was pretty confident that it would be a random dub release schedule and not a weekly simuldub.",

I wanna go back to the CR dub, but I'm worried we'll see a lot more of Thorkell in the future and watching Thorkell without Patrick Seitz is torture",

His VAs were a bit of a weird situation for me, because I liked David more for the first half of the show, when he was doing all his crazy mercenary/fighting shenanigans. But in the second half, when you learn about Askeladd's motivations, his backstory, and his connection to Wales, I started preferring Kirk more; his voice and performance just felt more dynamic and interesting to me there. David wasn't bad by any means, but I think the constant deep, gravelly voice he always spoke in just made shifts in Askeladd's emotions and demeanor feel less noticeable and impactful during this second half, imo.\n\nI, for one, will never forget episode 22. Kirk's performance in that episode was one for the history books. When he said to Thorfinn, \"I've had about enough of this,\" the venom in his voice sent CHILLS down my spine. That's the moment I knew that he was the definitive dub Askeladd, in my eyes.\n\nGoing away from that, Sentai's audio mixing was just objectively worse than Netflix's to me. Among the 3 big spheres of anime dubbing, LA (Netflix, CR, etc.), CR Texas, and Sentai, Sentai has always been the weakest. Their mixes sound very mid-heavy and boxy to my ears, to the point that sometimes you can even hear the reflections in their booth on some of their voice actors. In contrast, Netflix's audio mixing was crisp, clear, and very immersive sounding.\n\nSentai's script, to me, also felt disjointed compared to Netflix's. It felt like it went in and out of sounding poetic and sophisticated to all modern-sounding, which I didn't like; I wish they could've fully committed to one or the other. Their script also had more noticeable awkward pauses or repeating words, obviously to try and fit lip flaps. Netflix, in contrast, seemed to stick to a more modern style of speech consistently, which I appreciated and preferred. \n\nI will say, though, there were moments where I did prefer Sentai's more sophisticated script, like when Askeladd talked about his backstory in episode 22. When he described the land that Artorius lived in, Netflix's description felt weird \"A promised land of peace and abundance, where no one ages or dies.\" I did prefer Sentai's description, \"Peaceful and fertile, it is an ideal land of perennial youth and immortality.\"",

When he said to Thorfinn, \"I've had about enough of this,\" the venom in his voice sent CHILLS down my spine. \"\n\nFirstly i dont see anything unique in the performance itself its really not out of the oridinary and definitely nothing remotely different to what other va's presented. What did change however is ...[well](https://streamable.com/5gymyo). Lets just say i didnt expect to travel 40 years back in time for this to be acceptable.   \n\n\n&gt;\"It felt like it went in and out of sounding poetic and sophisticated to all modern-sounding, which I didn't like; I wish they could've fully committed to one or the other.

I remember quite clearly the netflix scene with flocki coming to visit thors and it really felt like both actors were recording these lines on completely different set of microphones and nobody bothered to smooth it out.   \n\n\nAs for the speech pattern.. well i always find it the positive of sentai dub. Rather then going with usual and boring writing that is no different then any other show they created something unique matching the time era show as presenting. As for the awkward pasues i havent noticed but i dont believe it can get much worse then netflix missing nearly [2 sec long screams](https://streamable.com/3396yw) with the camera pointed directly at askeladd and many **many** other obvious examples of them literally not paying attention what is happeinng on the screen.   \n\n\nNetflix dub seems like a joke of a product where nearly every important scene that requires a little tiny tiny bit of work is ruined by mismatched flaps or hell even the most [basic of fighting](https://streamable.com/7cukra) scenes that requires you to rewatch scene once or twice to understand when exactly character is suppose to grunt or for how long scream is simply butchered or dubbed half ass right. It really seems like nobody even took this much effort to dub it properly a shame cuz massive censorship that is forced down by netflix asside this could be a decent product but instead it feels like what is a slap to the face with the quality in many place even worse then jp dub.",

I loved how the dialogue was written, even if the voices were a bit corny. However, Season 2 for the Sentai dub just made me hate it. I absolutely adore dubs and try to watch the dubs first for shows that I enjoy, but Sentai's dub for S2 just about made me go to the subbed version. It seems everyone tried to give it their all for the first season, but after that, not only did the dialogue get worse, but the VAs now sound like they're not really as passionate about it, too.\n\nLooking forward to the Netflix dub. Hoping it makes the experience much better.",

It is the culture that world needs. As for the King she will not sell her integrity, but her underwear is for sale. She might even throw in a certain magazine for free.",

Mitsuha probably should have kept stuff like her tablet in her private room so she wouldn't need to explain if anyone saw it, but it was precious to see the eloquent young princess saying \"What is it? What is it? What is it?!\" like a regular kid. \ud83d\ude04 And Mitsuha getting carried away with her \"Lightning Messenger\" nickname then later being super embarrassed and counting it among her cringe moments was great. She was basically playing a isekai protagonist, knowing that's exactly what she is.",

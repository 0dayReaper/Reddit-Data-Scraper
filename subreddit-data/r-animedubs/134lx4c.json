That or, when this is done, I foresee Raeliana intervening to specifically prevent her from being fired which leads to her being the next member of Noah's household to become loyal to her. \n\nSeriously though, definitely a bad call to go with \"you follow my voice and come to me\" instead of the other way around. Whoever threw up the smokescreen would obviously have noted the locations of everyone in the room beforehand, and she should have known where she was relative to Raeliana before the smokescreen went up. Would have been a significantly safer call to have rushed to her side.",

She really needs to use it more often.",

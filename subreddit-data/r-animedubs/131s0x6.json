I can't even remember the show save for the premise and the fact that she also seems to have changed since she was so terrible to him (or maybe she treats him better as a result of his physical appearance. I forget)\n\n\nI remember liking it, and i hope season 2 is good. Its a revenge of the nerds kind of show, but without the sexual assault",

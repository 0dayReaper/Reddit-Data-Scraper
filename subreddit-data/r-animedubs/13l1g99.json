This is a show that's kind of like a summer popcorn flick of anime.  They're fun while you're at the theater.  But, then you forgot what you watched years later when someone brings it up.  Doesn't help the show has 50 gazillion characters and that they cycle many of them in and out like crazy.",

You're completely right, I like how you put it better, it's more broad.  If you asked me about the plot about the last five Transformers, Fast and Furious or Mission Impossible films, I wouldn't be able to describe any of that either, but I definitely paid money to be there for hours of all that noise.",

But will I watch the next one?  At some point, absolutely. And I'll probably enjoy it.  Even if it won't be memorable.",

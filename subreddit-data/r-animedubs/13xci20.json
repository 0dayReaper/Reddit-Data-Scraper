Her voice can change from her sweet motherly voice to her deadly one. The switch is so fast that it can be scary. \n\n- Newton Pittman: He has such a recognizable voice and can play rough guys well. My favorite role he played was Gray Fullbuster from Fairy Tail.",

The same can be said about Yuri he\u2019s way more than just Sasuke and I\u2019m sure the decade+ he\u2019s spent voicing him is going to come in handy for the black suit.\n\nOnce again not sure if he counts but Justin Briner. I bring him up cause I think people just know him as Izuku when I think he\u2019s a bit more than that to be fair I think it\u2019s safe to say Funimation type casted him as either kids or characters similar to Izuku but he also voiced Ayanokoji in Classroom of the Elite who\u2019s the complete polar opposite to Izuku. I didn\u2019t even know this show exists till friend recommended it to me and was shocked to see he was voiced by Justin but I was excited to FINALLY hear him play someone completely different and he killed it. Also I remember when the dub was starting to reach the Black Hero arc on Twitter people were questioning how good his performance would be hell even I was questioning if he could match his Japanese VA and I much prefer the dub of Hero Aca over the Japanese but he was going off like 2018 LeBron the entire season and I would be in the replies like Robert Patterson fans when he was casted as Batman being like \u201cNah dawg he got that dog in him trust me watch Classroom of the Elite\u201d and Justin was incredible during the Black Hero arc easily his best performance to date.",

He's new enough that I don't know if he would count as underrated, but I'll be rooting for him to go places.\n\nA person who probably better fits that description is Brandon Winckler, who's been around longer.\n\nI've always felt that Erin Yvette never got enough credit for her stellar voice work in various Telltale games. She's slowly been branching out into anime (Millenium Actress, Digimon Adventure 2020), and I hope her talent gets recognised there.\n\nHonestly, I think I'd have an easier time listing underrated roles from otherwise prolific voice actors.",

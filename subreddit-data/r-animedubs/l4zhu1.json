I have no doubt that he lent a great deal to the amazing, verbose Okabe that we received.",

We have survived the battle of Ragnarok!_\" ~ Rintaro Okabe\n\nAnd that's a wrap on the first non-VA bracket, plus the first to have 128 entrants in the knock-out stages. In the end Steins;Gate won out with 57 votes against Konosuba's 50, a relatively close battle considering a majority of the matchups had a clear winner.\n\nOn it's journey to finals the #9 seed also edged out Your Name (#8), Attack on Titan (#4) and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (#1), meaning it won against four higher seeded entrants on it's path to victory! And just like the last two brackets, we had a Texas vs LA showdown in the final, with the Funimation dub coming out on top this time.\n\nShare some of your favourite lines, moments or performances from the show to celebrate it's victory (and remember to make spoilers when needed).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###Main Cast &amp; Crew\n|Role|Name|Twitter\n:--|:--:|:--:|\nADR Director|Colleen Clinkenbeard|[@ccarrollbeard](https://twitter.com/ccarrollbeard)\nADR Script Writer|J Michael Tatum|[@JMichaelTatum](https://twitter.com/JMichaelTatum)\nADR Script Writer|Patrick Seitz|[@Seitz_Unseen](https://twitter.com/Seitz_Unseen)\nRintaro Okabe|J Michael Tatum|[@JMichaelTatum](https://twitter.com/JMichaelTatum)\nKurisu Makise|Trina Nishimura|[@TrinaNishimura](https://twitter.com/TrinaNishimura)\nItaru \"Daru\" Hashida|Tyson Rinehart|[@AttackonTyson](https://twitter.com/AttackonTyson)\nMayuri Shiina|Ashly Burch|[@ashly_burch](https://twitter.com/ashly_burch)\nSuzuha Amane|Cherami Leigh|[@CheramiLeigh](https://twitter.com/CheramiLeigh)\nMoeka Kiryu|Jessica Cavanagh|[@JessMarieCav](https://twitter.com/JessMarieCav)\nRuka Urushibara|Lindsay Seidel|[@severelylindsay](https://twitter.com/severelylindsay)\nFaris Nyannyan / Rumiho Akiha|Jad Saxton|[@jadbsaxton](https://twitter.com/jadbsaxton)\n\n&amp;nbsp;",

Yeah then it focuses on establishing character relationships and setting up future events for a while after that, but then it gets intense AF! There was only 1 ep of the entire season where I felt bored. Overall it's extremely well written with a truly impressive english dub considering the plot is so heavily rooted in Japanese culture. You def should watch this. But everything after season 1 is garbage and does not ad much to the story. For super fans only.",

Everything plays a part in setting up something.  Maybe a plot point.  Maybe a character back story.  None of the time is \u201cwasted\u201d or \u201cboring\u201d.  Different than the rest?  Sure.  But so\u2019s the first 20 minutes of a horror or mystery movie as they set the pieces.\n\nThe show is incredibly highly regarded for good reason.  Great original story.  Great adaptation.  Great original and dub voice performances.  (Ok, one specific joke is better in Japanese, but only because it switches from Japanese to English which a dub would obviously struggle with...sonnavabitch)",

The individual VA performances in Konosuba are probably better than some of those, but the ADR work and localization are big things for me when watching comedies, and I really can't think of too many times where Konosuba had me in stitches (except for the stuff with the dullahan, that was a riot). Comedy is probably the one genre for me where it's the hardest to distinguish between liking the dub, and liking the show, because so much of the comedy is reliant on both the line and the delivery.\n\nEdit: big, not bug",

I hate hearing people say there are actors that are just there for the paycheck. Why would a director even cast someone who isn\u2019t passionate about the job?",

But in order to mollify you, I (who haven't been watching anime for that long, and so don't have any kind of nostalgia bias towards FMA:B) happen to think FMA:B is among the best dubs, not because it is chock-full of outstanding performances (although it does have a few), but because it has a huge cast of recurring/plot-critical characters, none of whom (to my ear) were miscast or subpar. Which IMO is kind of an amazing feat.\n\nThe only \"modern\" anime that I would consider comparable (in terms of breadth of cast, and length of story) would be MHA, AoT, and the Raildex series. However, with none of those 3 being finished yet (and the quality of the Raildex dubs not being on par with the others for large portions), I don't tend to directly compare them to FMA:B\n\nSo even though I think, line-for-line, FMA:B doesn't measure up to many dubs out there. That they were able to avoid any noticeable missteps, with a large, recurring/plot-critical cast, and include some really great performances, makes it pretty amazing.",

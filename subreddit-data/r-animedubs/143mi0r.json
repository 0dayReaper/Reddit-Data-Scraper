However, for the 99th sacrifice, the human girl brought to the capital, Sariphi, intrigues the Beast King.*  \n*In fact, she isn't afraid of him or any other beast and even accepts her death without begging or crying, as she has neither home nor family to return to if she were released. The King finds her intriguing and let her stay at his side as his consort despite being human. This is the story of how Sariphi will become the queen of demons and beasts.*",

It's clear he doesn't like Sariphi, but that animus is because he has the kingdom's best interests at heart, and isn't the result of pettiness or ambitions. Compare him to the kitty bitch from a few weeks back, who was pettiness personified.\n\nThe human kid is big mad he got NTR'd by the anime beast man.",

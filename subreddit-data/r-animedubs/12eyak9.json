            "comment": "A reminder that Part 2 premieres in July.   \n\n\nIn the words of ANN's Rebecca Silverman, \"This is a condemnation of the majority of the male characters in the show. To put it mildly, they suck.\"  \n\n\nOverall this was an enjoyable show. The story is interesting; I love the relationship between Shall (or Chall) and Ann. The dub is very good. Matt Shipman (Jonas) does a good job voicing a despicable character. Celeste Perez (Ann) and Ivan Jasso (Shall) also do a really good job in the dub, voicing the na\u00efve optimistic artist and the stoic guardian, respectively.   \n\n\nI look forward to Part 2 in July.",

            "comment": "Ann did it. She's finally a silver sugar master. But I do think the cost of Shall giving up his wing may be too great. Although I will say that I loved how he was willing to give it up to Bridget without hesitation just to help prove Ann's innocence. And that last \"I didn't want to let go\" was probably the most genuine I've heard from him all season. I'm so glad we're getting more. I'm excited.\n\nThus ends another winter show (and also ends one half of Shawn Gann's SugarDaddy Fridays). I really enjoyed this. There were some parts that felt a little too slow of a build up. Other parts felt a little forced. But I overall enjoyed the watch. Especially getting to see Ann work on her craft, and her and Shall's relationship slowly bloom. Def **Celeste Perez** and **Ivan Jasso** were the highlights of the dub, not just for this show, but probably for the entire season too. Loved getting to hear their performance every week.\n\nDef a show that I really enjoyed mellowing out and relaxing to to after a long week of working. Looking forward to the next cour as well",

The ending was heartbreaking, and I hope he teams up with her to get Shall back.\n\nThat said, fuck this world. It's horrible. The fairies are treated as actual slaves, and yet somehow this world manages to make that feel better than being a goddamn female. There seems to be more people we've seen treat fairy slaves with respect than women.",

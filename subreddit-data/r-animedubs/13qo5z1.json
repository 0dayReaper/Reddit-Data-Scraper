Feels unusual to have a Netflix anime release the next half just six months later much like how *The Way of the Househusband* Season 1 Part 2 and *Tiger &amp; Bunny 2\u2019s* 2nd part we\u2019re released 6 months later when compared to the other Netflix anime who had their next parts be released either 3 or 4 months later respectively.",

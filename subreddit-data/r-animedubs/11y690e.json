            "comment": "I'm really curious what Taiju was saying about Hakkai. My immediate thought was that it was Hakkai, not Taiju, who's beating Yuzuha. But that wouldn't make sense since she would try to stab Hakkai, not Taiju. Maybe Taiju was compelling Hakkai somehow.\n\nGood cliffhanger, though.",

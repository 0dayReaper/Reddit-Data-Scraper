As a PREQUEL to Index - Railgun assumes you have some knowledge of the universe before watching it. Which can be lost if you didn't watch the first season of Index. (Thus my recommended watch order below.)  \n\n\nI think it's far more exciting to get to the sisters arc with context.  There are so many moments I went OHHHHHH on my first watch ever (First time I ever watched the series I did it in release order.)  --- That would have been lost had I not done Index first.  It made it more exciting to finally get there and be caught up with what was happening in Index as well.",

            "comment": "The Toaru universe of anime is arguably in my top 2 of all anime.  I have watched all the seasons of the shows many times. \n\nHere is my copy and pasted answer to this I have provided more times than I can count:\n\nAs someone that has rewatched the series several times and all the eps... And has tried different orders.  Do NOT watch in chronological order or you'll just be confused.  Watch it in this order, which seemed to provide the best experience.  (I also tried it with a new viewer and they greatly preferred this order) \n\nIndex I, Railgun, Railgun S, Accelerator, Index II, Index Movie, Railgun T. Index III.\n\nYou'll enjoy your experience much more that way and be less confused.  If also results in you having a lot more surprises this way. And having far greater impact.  \n\n(I recommend this order much like I would recommend a new viewer of star wars not start with episode I.  You'll see why.)\n\n\nChronological order can be confusing because it will assume you know things you don't. (And ends up in a disjointed viewing experience with a lot of back and forth) - I'd try to explain it but I'd have to create a whole wiki just to do that lol.\n\nRelease order works but I think can be a drag and also reveals things early that have more of an impact if you watch the way I suggested.  And you won't be (as) confused haha. (Release order is Index I, Railgun, Index II, Railgun S, The Movie, Index III, Accelerator, Railgun T) \n\nWatching each series separately is NOT optimal because you WILL be confused.  It will assume you know things you do not know.  It will diminish the impact of certain revelations.  It will make you care less about some characters you really will care about knowing more of their backstory.  (The amount of confused folk that have only seen Railgun or only Index or only Accelerator is a dime a dozen --- Don't be one of them.) \n\nThat said the order I provided will definitely provide optimal experience with less confusion.",

I know that focuses on Misaka while on the other hand the Index series has Touma as the primary character, he's powerful and likeable as a protagonist but geez I personally don't like him as a person, he's a jerk tbh.

I would recommend against it.  You'll find so many people on the Index sub confused about what's going on in Railgun.  Who characters are. Etc. And it is for this very reason.  As of this second.  The third season of Index is skippable.  But.  I don't think anything else is. (But it will be necessary viewing material prior to a potential index 4.  Railgun source material is moving at a slower pace and is not even close to caught up to index.  It's not even into Index III yet.)\n\nIf anything... RAILGUN is more skippable in terms of understanding the lore.  Although it's (in my opinion) the better series overall so I would NOT skip it.  Index moves at a quicker pace having multiple arcs in every season (usually 4) whereas Railgun has 2 arcs.  As a result it's a more intimate experience.  BUT...  Again.  Railgun usually assumes you have watched index to fill in the gaps.  It introduces characters Railgun will just act like you should know who they are.",

                    "comment": "Chronological would start with the first season of railgun.   \nRelease order would start with Index.  \nThen there is the modified order which I recommended which is kind of a combination of two that is probably just the optimal way to watch in general and was recommended by a couple others here also (You'll never be confused on what's going on.  You'll know all the characters and they'll be properly introduced.  It makes most of the \"reveals\" bigger.  And it emphasizes most of the biggest arcs and gives them the most power.)    \n\n\nI would NOT watch the shows separately or in Chronological order.  I always recommend against that.  Both can leave you confused and diminish the impact of certain things.    \n\n\nSeparately, you'll have ZERO idea what's going on in railgun by the third season.  You'll be like... Who is this character? Why is this happening?  Who cares about this?    \nIndex is more watchable without railgun, but a HUGE amount of impact by having not watched railgun is diminished.  Same with accelerator to index.  \n\n\nChronological order is just not really how the show is designed to be watched either.  You'll have characters that you should have been introduced to that you'll have no idea who they are.  You'll have story beats that you the viewer are supposed to be aware of that... You won't.  And the show will assume you understand why things are happening or what's going on that... You just don't.  (Also, if you wanted to do TRUE chronological order.... It would result in you having to go back and forth between index and railgun.  Episode by episode.  It's a mess.)   \n\n\nIf you don't do the modified order I suggest.  Release order is DEFINITELY next best bet. The show can 100% be watched that way and will still have a similar enough impact as to watching in modified order.  HOWEVER, it will diminish the impact of most of the arcs of Railgun S by doing it this way and having had watched Index 2, THEN going into railgun S.  Which is why I always recommend watching Railgun S after Railgun.",

Apparently S3 is more reliant on the info from Index so I haven't started it yet.\n\nThat being said, neither is a great action anime -- Railgun is more SOL with some action (though the action is just stellar when it does show up, especially in S2), and Index is just not good, so if you're looking for constant action you might be better served with Fate (which is like Index, but actually good -- except for the 2006 anime, which is not great).",

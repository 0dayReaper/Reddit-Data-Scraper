So many friends willing to sacrifice for Fushi. The only thought I have is that this feels like a lead up to all of Fushi's forms coming back to life to fight at his side in an  Avengers Endgame like battle vs the Knockers.",

How I\u2019d differentiate that is that the show moves you emotionally with the highs and lows but  doesn\u2019t have you feeling pity for the mc the whole time. The tragic parts are a part of what makes the story premise so good but it\u2019s not doom and gloom all the time.",

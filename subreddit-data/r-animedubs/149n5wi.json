Usually cause they aged out of the role but continued to voice the character anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll start: Kirby Morrow who voice Miroku for like 1 or episode in Yashahime, man...he just sounded rough, I feel bad to say it, but he could just not do the voice.",

But for Kirby Morrow situation, he was facing serious health issues that he later on died from before Season 1 of Yahshime even finished. In fact, because of his health and death he was replaced. Outside of obvious aging of the actors, I think the 2019 Fruit Basket did a pretty great job. IT has some really strong performances all around, etc.",

The voice sounded straight up awful and cringe and was way off how Erika Harlacher did her justice in the Neflix dub, this is probably why that actress had to go by a pseudonym in order to prevent harassment. It was a really facepalming and unnecessary move by Sentai and thankfully they won't do such a thing again with Netflix titles they grab for home video release.",

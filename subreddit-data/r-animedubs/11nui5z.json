    "postText": "Please tell us a little bit about what dubbed shows you've been watching for the past couple of weeks, or currently watching right now. Old or new, as long as it's dubbed we'd like to hear about it. \n\nAnything good we should look out for? Anything bad we should try to avoid? Tell us a little bit of what you think. It's nice if you elaborate a bit on what it is you like or don't like about a show. That way your comment is useful to people who are looking for new anime to watch. :)\n\nWriting the names of the anime in **bold** is nice, to make it easier for people skimming the thread to pick out the names.\n\nSince this is also for people who are looking for new shows to watch, please use the spoilertag if you reveal any mayor plot points of the anime you are discussing (see spoilertag section in the sidebar for info on how).\n\n\nTo prevent low effort comments to steal the spotlight from people who put in a little bit more effort **top level comments in this thread must be at least 150 characters long** (roughly 3 sentences long).\n\n\n[You can find a list of the previous \"Your week in anime dubs\" posts here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/search/?q=author%3AAutoModerator+AND+title%3AYour+week+in+anime+dubs&amp;sort=new)",

Also love how that blondie is voiced by the same VA in English and Japanese.\n\nAlso watching Reincarnated as a sword, Bofuri, and Saving 80000 gold in another world, but they are mostly generic (I'm talking about dubs, not the animes themselves).",

            "comment": "**My Roommate Is A Cat** - Just finished this one a few days ago, and the story did a great job of showing Subaru's growth throughout this short series as he went from someone who used to spend his days alone to gradually welcoming more friends into his life. The humor was consistently great, and the finale was really heartwarming showing how far everyone had come as well as the strength of their friendships. Probably my favorite slice-of-life series. **Rating: 9/10**\n\nI've also started rewatching **Sword Art Online: War of Underworld** again because it's my favorite, so I revisit this arc often. I love how it brings together the characters and themes of every previous arc, and the battles are fantastic. I watched part 1 this week, so next week I'll be watching part 2.",

            "comment": "This week, I watched ***Summer Time Rendering***. Exciting animes in the horror-mystery-thriller realm are surprisingly rare, and I often enjoy them. This one was a good addition to my resume.\n\nNot really sure what to point out about it in particular; the show had me on the edge of my seat for most of its runtime. A very cool scenario with &gt;!time loops!&lt; as a plot device to steer the mystery aspect in an interesting way. Overall, *Summer Time Rendering* gave me pretty strong *Shiki* vibes, including &gt;!a human and a non-human party fighting and trying to outsmart each other, and the gradual shift in focus from eery atmosphere to violent action.!&lt;\n\nI was somewhat disappointed by the last few episodes (excluding the enjoyable epilog) becoming more and more outrageously supernatural. It felt to me like the writer of the story constantly tried to one-up themself on how much edgy craziness they could shove in.\n\nStill, I overall really liked the series.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also saw the first 4 episodes of ***Three Leaves, Three Colors***. It's one in a sea of cute-girl slice-of-life comedies, but I'm having fun with it. Yoko as the princess fallen into poverty glues the show together thus far.",

The CG animation is stunningly beautiful, and I'm surprised at how much of a departure the story is (8 dubbed eps in) from the OG series. I think it's the right choice, given how popular the original series is, and re-watching the same story again just isn't interesting to most audiences. We'll see how the rest of the series plays out but I'm really happy with what I've seen and I'm looking forward to the direction this series goes.\n\nPour one out, though, for our missing character: &gt;!Milly Thompson!&lt;. Probably the one real weak difference, but it's not a dealbreaker for me.",

Dropped Tomo-chan because I'm not a fan of the main leads, and BOFURI S2 because it's been kind of boring compared S1.\n\nI'm still upset they chose to dub a bunch of terrible junk food anime like Iceblade Sorcerer and Strongest Exorcist over actual good anime like Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten.",

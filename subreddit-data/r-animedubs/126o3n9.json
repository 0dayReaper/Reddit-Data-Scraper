But no, this is amazing that most of the original actors from the 2010 *Scott Pilgrim* film that came out 13 years ago are coming back to reprise their roles for the *Scott Pilgrim* anime from Science Saru.\n\nEver since the announcement of the anime back in January of 2022, it was going to go either way if the original actors from the 2010 film were set to return but since Edgar Wright (director of the original 2010 film) has some involvement as Executive Producer for the anime the expectations of the original actors returning was 100%. Curious on the rest of the voice actors that will do background/Additional voices for the *Scott Pilgrim* anime would they be Los Angeles-based voice actors or Canadian (Vancouver or Toronto) voice actors, because the *Scott Pilgrim* Graphic Novel and Film are set in Toronto, Canada and the author, Bryan Lee O'Malley is Canadian as is Michael Cera?",

They have to be animating the voices to the original Japanese VAs, I just don't understand how what you're saying makes any sense unless the dub audio was recorded simultaneously. \n\nAre you saying that they're not animated for *any* specific language initially and just match the Japanese audio to arbitrary lip flaps, which are tailored more to the future Western audio? I am genuinely baffled by your assertion that the mouth movements aren't matched to the Japanese audio.",

The Japanese seiyuu then dub over the footage - when I say \"dub\", I don't mean \"translated voice acting\" which is what a lot of people use it for. I mean specifically \"recording over existing footage\". You might notice in some subbed anime the lip flaps don't match perfectly all the time (sometimes less so than English dubs!), which would be odd if they animated to dialogue.\n\nThe biggest exception to this is Akira. You can see the animators clearly animated to dialogue, so the mouth movements are much more specific (and thus makes the dubs look a bit janky).",

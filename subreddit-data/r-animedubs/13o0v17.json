It's a total crapshoot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there a way to know which dvd releases have it and which don't?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike with the Yu Yu hakusho DVD's, they DO have dubtitles...but only for like the first disc after which funimation gave up and went to using generic subtitles.",

The same on HIDIVE, Hulu, prime video, etc.  Funimation used generic subtitles and forced them in the off section so you have no choice it\u2019s either closed captioning or subtitles.  Crunchyroll takes the subtitles of the text objects from the sub version and puts them in the dubs.",

A lot of people here are talking about streaming even though the poster clearly stated they were talking about DVDs.\n\nI remember that older releases used to almost always have separate tracks for the subtitles for the Japanese and English audios. Around the 2010's though, they started to only have subtitles for the Japanese audio. In particular I remember watching the Hetalia English dub and had trouble understanding what they were saying, but subtitles didn't help at all because it was for the Japanese version. Unfortunately I don't think any physical media release has had separate subtitle tracks since like 2008 or something, because accessibility is so often treated as only an afterthought at best, if thought of at all =/",

            "comment": "CGI anime has been pretty troubled in looks and design in general, with only a few really standing out (e.g., Land of the Lustrous.)  \n\n\nNetflix produced a lot of CGI anime when it first got into the game, which scorned a lot of people since it can often look scuffed if not done well. That said, there's quite a few that have decent to good CGI, like Ajin: Demi Human, Knights of Sidonia, Beastars, and Hi-Score Girl.  \n\n\nIn truth, I think it's mostly that people just prefer the more natural 2D style of animation. I think it suits the medium better especially since anime is already made on tight budgets and timelines, which means it's probably even harder to make the CGI look good. Hell, even Hollywood struggles to put out good CGI in their blockbusters these days.",

It looks *fine*, some of the animation looks decently fluid, but there's still that hard plastic look to everything that anime CGI can't seem to pull away from.  \n\n\n It'll probably be just OK in the end, but we'll see come anime launch. The intro could be smooth but the actual show be jank, especially in later episodes when things get tighter budget and timewise.",

Yakitori has a good story, I'm watching it right now and enjoying it, but the full 3d style comes across as lazy to me, like they didn't have the budget to do better. At least it only is annoying doing slow story bits, when it gets into the fighting it's easier to ignore and thus enjoy.",

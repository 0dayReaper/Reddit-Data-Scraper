Maybe hit a patch of soft earth and fell \"correctly\" for a completely mundane explanation. No one really saw him pull the girls from the fire, so maybe he was just Cid Kagenou lucky. But his entire class saw him throwing hands *with a fucking bear*.",

Eventually Yuya won't be able to control his own strength anymore. Suplex a bear and cause a devastating earthquake.",

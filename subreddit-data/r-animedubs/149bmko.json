You can tell how thankful she is for Aqua for putting on a brilliant performance in the Sweet Today shoot.\n\nAnd I'm surprised Minami was given a Southern accent, her voice fits so well too.",

I've seen it so much that when she spoke \"oh neat she's from Kansai or out West\" was my first thought even before Ruby mentioned it. I would assume in the manga she put on a fake Kansai accent as well, so they just carried it over with the usual Southern replacement.",

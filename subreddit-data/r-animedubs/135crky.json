    "postText": "To all the people who watch Toonami every Saturday night like myself what are some shows you'd like to see appear on the block weather its older shows maybe even from the CN days or some recent shows for me the two biggest ones that probably have a good shot of appearing is JJK and Tokyo Revengers especially Tokyo Revengers I think that show would fit Toonami like a glove don't know if they can even get S2 since thats own by Disney but who knows. The Blood War is another big one but who knows maybe that's one of the three shows they're waiting on Japan to finally give them the green light fingers crossed. NOMAD is another was honestly surprised it didn't appear on the block but maybe the ratings for Megalo Box weren't what they were hoping for",

I remember they used to do this every once in a while, and that's how I watched Summer Wars, but anime movies in particular have a really limited availability here when you can't go to a theater - sometimes they'll show up with an option to buy, often they're only on one streaming service or sometimes none at all. If they could get the SAO movies, that would be awesome.",

The block has been slowly dying for a few years now.\n\nI used to wish for A+ tier shows, but now i just want something anything that isn't primal. \n\nWith streaming and such i think Toonami should stray away from the top shows anyways since most anime fans are already watching them. And they should focus on those less watched but still decent shows to at least fill up the slots and be a cool place to watch shows you wouldn't normally think of watching.\n\nBut ill take just about anything at this point. Just get whatever is cheap to at least get the block feeling alive again.",

But now, millennials have all but completely cut the cord to traditional television.  Anyone who is into anime enough to want to watch the entire block probably has at least one stemming service that will provide a lot more content than 3 hours once a week. \n\nThat being said, I think Toonami (for their own survival) should focus on the most mainstream sites that they can.   So, it should have some form of Naruto and Dragon Ball with the remaining spots used for things like One Piece, Inuyasha, Gundam (fill in your sufex), Bleach, YuYu Hakusho, and maybe one \"newer\" very popular shonen anime like MHA, JJK, Demon Slayer, ect.\n\nThe time for Toonami to be an integral part of the anime scene in the US has come and gone.  Now, they should focus on nostalgia and very very casual fans.",

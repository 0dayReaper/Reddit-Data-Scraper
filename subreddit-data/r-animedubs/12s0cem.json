Like all of Shinkai's films it looks gorgeous and is incredible to see on the big screen. It's also always good to support theatrical releases of anime if you're able to. The movie itself is also fantastic, right on par with Your Name for me",

The acting is great though!\n\nFrom a movie standpoint, it's a straight up go watch the movie. It looks beautiful, hit all the right emotional notes (there's some **real** dark ones in there too if you can see it from a Japanese person's perspective), and has a feel good story about growing up and helping yourself heal from trauma.\n\nA small negative. It has a couple of moments where you think the story is wrapping up, but it continues on.\n\nOverall, go watch it! It'll do your soul good :)",

Every little thing moves; grass petals blow individually, and the lighting is amazing. \n\nThe overall film I thought was so-so. After two similar \"boy meets girl\" romance movie in *Your Name* and *Weathering With You*, Shinkai's latest work feels too formulaic, and the story itself is messy. But the conclusion at least ties the narrative together better than *Weathering with You*. (I watched *Suzume* subbed though, so maybe it is better in the dub.)",

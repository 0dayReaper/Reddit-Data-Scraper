It's nice if you elaborate a bit on what it is you like or don't like about a show.

            "comment": "Finally got around to watching **The Eminence in Shadow**. I had tried watching a few episodes a while back, but decided to put it on hold until it finished. Honestly, for a show that had as much hype and quality as this one, I was pretty disappointed.\n\nI know that the show is supposed to be a bit of a parody, but I just found the MC to be too unlikeable and unfunny to actually enjoy most of the parody aspects. When the MC wasn't on screen or had minimal screen time, I actually enjoyed the show. The production value is obviously good, and I found the world building and story to be interesting. I also found most of the parody aspects that didn't rely on MC too much to be pretty funny as well (a little more tongue-in-cheek). I just really couldn't get past the issue with the MC.\n\nI'll admit, I don't always like Parody shows right off the bat. Even shows I really end up liking (e.g. Misfit of Demon King Academy, Konosuba, Trapped in a Dating Sim, Last Dungeon Boonies, etc) sometimes take me a watch or two before I really enjoy them. However, the humor in this show just didn't generally do it for me. After getting super high I noticed the humor hit a little better, but in general, I just never found it absurd enough or clever enough to be enjoyable. I think if the humor had been more over the top (like Konosuba), or more tongue-in-cheek (like Misfit of Demon King Academy), or the MC had just been the least but likeable, I probably would have enjoyed the show much better.\n\nAn interesting premise that clearly worked for most folks, but just didn't resonate with me unfortunately. The hype and rave reviews probably didn't help much either. While I went in with tempered expectations (based on the genre, and personal experience), it still came up well short, and was just generally a disappointing (and at times frustrating) experience. **6/10**\n\nI also finished up **The Ice Guy and His Cool Female Colleague** this week. This was one where I'm really glad I gave it the full 3 episodes to make a decision to drop or not. It started off a bit slow and dry for my taste, but the characters really grew on me as the show progressed. I especially liked that they developed the relationships between the characters outside of the \"main couple\". It ended up being much cuter than I was expecting from the first episode or two as the characters *warmed up* to each other (see what I did there?). Definitely an enjoyable watch, especially if you're looking for something pretty warm and fuzzy on a shitty weather day, or something to make you feel a bit better when you're sick. **7.5/10**\n\nLastly, I finally watched **No Game, No Life: Zero**. This movie was amazing. Great story with great characters and amazing world building. The production value was spot on as well. This movie had a great blend of action, comedy, and drama. Despite being a prequel/tie-in to the show, this movie would also be pretty great as a standalone film as well. Honestly, I just don't have much to say because I thought it was just that good. **9.5/10**",

                    "comment": "Yeah I don't get the hype for Eminence at all. It's just not as funny as people think it is. At least Misfit had me DYING with its first episode when Anos beat the shit out of that guy and it was just more enjoyable overall, but this\u2026 this ain't it chief. But then again, I guess I'm biased since I seem to prefer more serious stories.\n\nAlthough, I would give it a 7/10 just because the waifus made me stick around (Alpha is *especially* bae \ud83d\ude29) and I found the direction they're taking Rose in at the end pretty interesting. I don't mind watching the next season, but I highly doubt I'll be watching it as it airs, whether it's sub or dub.\n\nSorry guys, but Cid is Mid. Anos is a true god. \ud83d\udc80",

The first cour OP and ED are a mega vibe. The first cour is excellent and slightly stronger than the second, but I still easily recommend watching the entire show. The ending is very satisfying. I couldn't get this show out of my head until I binged the whole thing. Give it a go.",

I'm not big on overpowered protagonists in general, but what makes it great in this anime is the fact that the show and all of the characters in it are *aware* that Maple's power level is simply absurd. The post-episode chat snippets are legit a highlight of the series for me.\n\nSeason 2 seems to struggle a little bit with one-upping itself by giving Maple even crazier skills, but it's still entertaining. And also cute. The tentacle skill is hilarious.",

            "comment": "All of the anime I'm currently watching by myself are subbed, I'm watching a lot of subbed seasonals. The only dub I watched was **Golden Boy**, I finally binge-watched all but the last episode (I might get to that today after I post this actually). I'm...not that big a fan. The direction is great but I don't really like the writing.\n\nNow with friends, there are definitely a few. I'm showing one of them **s-CRY-ed** because it's one of my favorite anime and they're also really digging it. On the flip side, a different friend is showing me **Princess Tutu** because it's one of their favorite anime. I'm not digging it though. Honestly Princess Tutu just kinda bores me. I also finally got another episode done of **Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song** in a different friend group. Great show.\n\nWith the \"main group\" that I watch stuff in, there are two major things we're watching: first is **Code Geass: Akito the Exiled** because I've really wanted to watch it in-between our watches of the TV series. Akito the Exiled is fine. Definitely not as good as the show but the third movie picked up the pace. The other thing we're watching is we started **Girls Bravo**, which is definitely a hood classic. So far if you asked me if it was good or not I'd give you a confused shrug. It's Girls Bravo. You get what you get. Maybe I'll have more defined feelings the next time I post here.\n\nFinally, there are three shows that we \"checked out\". First is the first two episodes of **Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet**. Watched with three other people and I was the only one who didn't really get into it. I dunno I don't think this one's for me. The other two are new seasonal shows. **Dead Mount Death Play** kinda split the group. Me and another friend liked it, the rest didn't. It's Ryogo Narita, I'm trusting the plan, me and that friend will watch more. The last show we checked out was **My Home Hero**. Oh. Oh baby. So bad it's good. One of my friends described it as a Dhar Mann video. We're definitely watching the rest.",

That gave me some tonal whiplash when I found that out !&lt;\n\nBecause I like tonal whiplash I then went to watch **Ascendance of a Bookworm.** I'm mostly done and it is a really well done show. I'm not one for books myself but I'm sure we all have that one passion that we can sympathise with that we cant live without. &gt;!Also surprised that if they were true to the source material the show would be closer to 18+.... This show has some dark undertones for being so cutesy !&lt;\n\nAlso been keeping up with many of the Crunchyroll Dubs.

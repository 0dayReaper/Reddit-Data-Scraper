Guess we'll need to see, but I think fixing it for the Blu-Ray will be a given, unless CR REALLY drops the ball.",

The rest is speculation on my part, but if we take that literally then the fastest possible turnaround would be to have Aaron record his lines for the new episode first and then rerecord the previous episode right after\n\nOne of the reasons dubs are 2 weeks behind is to give the dub team more time to work. So assuming the rest of the cast started working on the new episode right away on Thursday, and that Aaron won\u2019t get back till sometime Monday. That gives the rest of the cast 3 days to record the new episode and then 2 days for Aaron to record the new episode followed by the previous episode. Then they would likely put them both up on Thursday",

Much would've preferred a delay if that was an option.\n\nEdit: I guess the VAs couldn't be in town to record? I don't really use Twitter so I missed the tweet lol. Mightve been nice to know before I watched the episode but oh well. I'm guessing delay wasn't an option due to a contract restraint or something.",

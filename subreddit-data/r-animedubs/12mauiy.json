    "postText": "\n[The below post is a spoiler for Ice Guy And His Cool Female Colleague]\n\nThere are a lot of great romance anime that have an awesome build-up the entire season and then it ends with the the main couple still being friends. No kiss, no getting together, nothing. \n\nThe most recent one for me was Ice Guy And His Cool Female Colleague. \n\nIn general, it was a great feel-good anime, but the romance was horrible. However, Tomo-Chan Is A Girl did a great job in my opinion. Much better than most romance anime. \n\nAnyone else feel the same?",

            "comment": "Part of it is the chase, so to speak. A lot of various romance series, the narrative is the buildup to the confession. Then some authors/Mangaka have trouble writing the two leads as actually in a relationship. That and readers often lose interest as the chase was what got them invested.\n\nJust is what it is.\n\nAlso Tomo was a complete adaption, ie no more manga to adapt so them ending with the 2 of them together makes sense.",

Because he said most manga and LN writers write for the chase.  Not so much the resolution.  Or they don't know what to do when they get together besides creating drama.  So... Most don't.  They write for the chase. Not the resolution.",

I just finished watching Ice Guy and it's the biggest disappointment of the season for me. \n\nIf the focus of the show had been on the slice of life aspect, then having the background romance leave us hanging for a potential season 2 would've been totally fine. But the focus from the very start was on that romance,  and there wasn't much else to distract, so to have absolutely no resolution was a travesty.",

I don't mind shows were *little* happens, but I at least need some banter between the leads to entertain me. Like, I'm not going to sit here and pretend that Angel Next Door taught a masterclass in pacing, it's excruciatingly slow, but I at least still had fun watching those two talk to each other.\n\nIce Guy and Boring Female Colleague had no chemistry, no spark, whatsoever. Ice Guy, frankly, seemed like an utter simpleton, getting stressed out over very basic things, things *so* basic that Colleague only has to give it a couple minutes of thought to solve his problems. And then she gets praised as this considerate, kind person. No, she just has a functional brain and access to an internet search engine.\n\nSome people over on the main anime subreddit really liked the show and I felt like I *had* to be missing something, so after that first (terrible) episode, I forced myself through the second, and that was *even worse*. Then I watched the third ~~because I hate myself~~ because I was still trying to find out some reason why people could think the show was anything other than terrible. And I gave up, because I couldn't see it.\n\nWhat's funny in retrospect is that I've seen people say [Ice Guy] &gt;!episode 3 was basically the height of the romance between the leads and then nothing happens. Which is impressive, because not much happened in episodes 1-3, either.!&lt;",

The characters who are together are happy together, they just aren't willing to admit to themselves that they're worthy of being with their partner. The whole point of the show is that they're all awkward and don't know how to be couples, but they're figuring it out in real time while being beaten within an inch of their life by their anxiety over the situation.",

I guess I misworded my core point: Every main character repeatedly misinterprets the relationships between the other main characters based on fleeting glimpses/observations of situations they see out of context. That's why they often *think* their love interest has eyes for somebody else. Which is what I think primarily hampers the romantic progress for each of the \"happy\" couples.",

They for sure keep them in limbo for 3 straight seasons, even though they both know they love each other off the rip. I was more invested in the side characters by the end of it",

They still aren't in the manga on that one, but it also has way more romantic progression in one season than kaguya did in two.

Season 2 is about getting over that denial, and Season 3 is finally acting on their feelings. If you really think that it was three seasons of \"dicking around,\" then I don't even know what to say to you other than you're objectively wrong.",

You've gotta dig deep to come up with reasons you think it is, and that's already telling.  WHOLE SEASON TO GET OVER DENIAL, like jfc there wasn't really denial from the start. Just a refusal to confess\n\n\nEvery single time I run into one of you I always see that sentence \"you're objectively, factually, and actually wrong!\"  Like just saying it doesn't make it true, its objectively a bad romance plot with a good comedic cast.

It's also hard to watch in retrospect as the series takes place over a year and the relationship didn't progress at all. If we were watching a HS anime, I could by that...but this is a show about adults that (you would think) are more emotionally mature than that.  It's frustrating.",

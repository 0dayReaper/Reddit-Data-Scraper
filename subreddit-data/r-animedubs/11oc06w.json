    "postText": " \n\nSo Campfire Cooking in Another World with My Absurd Skill is going to be only subtitled it appears.\n\n\\*sigh\\*\n\nSeems to me that studios don't care much for giving cooking anime the dub treatment for some reason. ( Just because it involves food, doesn't mean it's a cooking anime. I'm looking at you, Ben-To)\n\nI loved Restaurant to Another World, and Food Wars was good. Kakuriyo and Laid Back Camp were good, even if they are really borderline for being considered a cooking anime.\n\nAny other recommendations?",

Compared to the manhua \n\nFarming in another world I would recommend although it\u2019s not labelled as gourmet man do the visuals on all the veg and fruit and the varieties of stuff he grows is great to watch and it\u2019s very laid back and the story is good I was so glad it got an adaptation :) and I highly would recommend it :) \n\nThe bistro of li linke I haven\u2019t finished yet but I recommend it \n\nKakurio-bed &amp; breakfast for spirits is another great anime I loved the story and the characters and the cooking is awesome and relaxing to watch :) I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s completed as an adaptation aswell \n\nIsekai izakaya Japanese food from another world is very similar to resturant from another world I really enjoyed it the characters were loveable and the different variations of food was great aswell as at the end of almost all the episodes they teach you how to cook it by a professional chef and all the ingredients and measurements you need :) \n\nCooking with Valkyrie is one I haven\u2019t finished yet but I really enjoyed it :) \n\nDagashi kashi is another I liked I\u2019d say it\u2019s a mix between gourmet and sweets as it\u2019s based around a guy taking over a sweet shop and a girl that introduces him to the world of sweets (rough summary I can\u2019t remember it sorry)",

            "comment": "**Takunomi** is about drinking but they also talk about food/snacks that pairs with the drinks.  It's akin to **Restaurant to Another World** and **Food Wars** where they overly describe food/drinks.\n\nA lot of isekais detour or have focus on food/cooking.  It's a pretty common troupe that the MC usually looks for soy sauce, miso, and rice. And/or since they come from a more modern era and transported into a more primitive time when they cook everyone is impressed. **Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear** and **How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom** were two of them.\n\n **The World's Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Aristocrat** had some brief cooking in it.\n\n**Blue Exorcist** and **If It's for My Daughter I'd Even Defeat a Demon Lord** both had cooking in them if I remember correctly.\n\nI know there were a few more isekais but I can't think of them off the top of my head right now.",

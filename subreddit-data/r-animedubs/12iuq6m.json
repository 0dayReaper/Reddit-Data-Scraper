            "comment": "Loved, loved, LOVED this show so much. Each episode felt like a nice warm hug. Himuro and Fuyutsuki are just too cute each episode. And it was one of my favorite shows of the Winter 2023 shows. Def looked forward to spending my Tuesdays watching this, and once again later in the evening as a winddown from work.\n\nLoved what the cast and crew brought to this. Def in great hands with **Michelle Rojas** directing. And though I love **Leah Clark's** funny scripts, I def enjoyed the wholesomeness and more groundedness of this show's writing. **Lee George** is def someone that will get me to watch a show if I see his name in the cast list. He was a great choice for Himuro. His voice is just so good, rich, and cool. Fitting for Himuro, but I loved his inner thoughts and reacting to all things cute (aka Fuyutsuki). Speaking of which, I also loved **Kristen McGuire** as Fuyutsuki. I don't think there was a single time this show where she had to raise her voice above a soft-spoken one. And it was comforting, soft, and very homey. Both of them are up there with two of my favorite performances of the season so far. Just really chill, really adorable, and very caring towards each other. \n\nLoved the rest of the office coworkers too: **Caitlin Glass**, **Austin Tindle**, and even **Emily Fajardo** and **Dallas Reid** too. Def would be very happy if this one got another season. Office romcoms can be great if done right. And I feel that Ice Guy and his Cool Female Colleague def got it right.",

            "comment": "The show never failed to leave a calming feeling. I did expect a little more from the finale but they are both so calm, collected, and a bit overly respectful of others boundaries. I guess the growth for the both of them was admitting they\u2019ve positively impacted each other over the past year. Progress too slow for the human eye to see but big for them. \n\nIt did feel like a set up for other seasons, more to come but when you let the finale pass like that with a shrinking fever being the highlight, it sours the season a bit. At least that\u2019s how I feel. 7/10 overall where I\u2019d watch season 2 if announced but don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be reading the manga to know more anytime soon.",

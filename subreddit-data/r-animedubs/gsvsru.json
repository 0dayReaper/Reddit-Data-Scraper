There is so much material to cover to this point in the manga and still more yet to go before it finishes, how can the anime encompass all of it? I get the feeling that the anime will get to a certain spot and than stop but it would be a tragedy for the anime not to finish this last arc.",

Already after Araki left, the series lost some of his high energy and intense charm. And season 3 had some big issues in it, in terms of animation and adaptation. So it's no like WIT has a flawless track record. And MAPPA had made some good stuff too, so it's not a big downgrade (compared to something like OPM season 1  and 2 downgrade for example).",

WIT has done great work with AoT, but the precedent was set by S1's director. WIT has had a lot of controversy regarding its production scheduling and work environment as well. I still love the seasons they put out before the final season was handed over to MAPPA, but I do wonder how things would've been if the directorship hadn't changed. I'm sure the long break between S1 and S2 wouldn't have been as long.",

Its all about the small group of protagonists literally going up against the whole world, figuring out mysteries, gaining allies and getting the ball rolling on a military takeover. Meanwhile the anime kinda takes the first and seventh chapters of that arc and makes them into the first episode, just so they would have a cool Levi fight to show off at that summer convention. Then they kinda quickly hop from one plot point to the next at breakneck pace. I mean the damn takeover happened in like 5 episodes. It made it seem like a quick side adventure. Basically they sucked all the soul out of that arc and just rushed through it to get through it.",

He suggested that things should be rearranged in general and had final say. So him approving the changes would be more accurate.\n\n&gt;You know how honorable japanese men are. If the studio makes changes and tell the author to tell the fans that he approved it\n\nThe hell are you talking about? Being honorable doesn't mean you have to go along with disrespect. If Japan is so honorable, the studio wouldn't make any changes without permission. Respect for the creator is something almost every studio and anime production adheres to.  If the studio made significant changes without Isayama's permission after adapting the manga so faithfully and with his approval for 37 episodes, they would be the disrespectful ones. \n\n&gt; If an author is honored with an actual adaptation of his work, he is gonna keep himself lower than dirt and shill it.\n\nThe honor isn't on the author for getting an adaptation. If anything it's on the committee for getting to do it. They have to get permission from the author to even do an adaptation. And the reason the author almost always supports their anime adaptation is because that's basic professional respect/decency.\n\n&gt; If it truly was he who asked them to mess up the arc's continuity and rush through it at breakneck pace\n\nThe anime didn't do that though.

They rarely say bad things about their adaptations, even if they are terrible. Do if Wit made some changes, fucked up the arc, and told Isayama to say he was in charge of the changes, then he will do what 99% of japanese people do, he will bow, thank them for their generosity and do as he is told. That is just japanese culture 101. \n\nAnd if he really made the changes, then he made a big mistake, and fucked up this arc.",

The fall season had the impressive lineup of Promised Neverland 2, Slime isekai 2, Seven deadly sins 4, Log horizon 3 and AOT 4. And yet, all of them except Log horizon 3, have been postponed. \n\nAlso, they released a trailer for season 4, but it's a concept trailer, not the real thing.",

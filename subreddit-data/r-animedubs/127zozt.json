    "postText": "[Mediatoon Distribution has acquired the worldwide rights to the upcoming second season of the NTV anime series Edens Zero.](https://worldscreen.com/tvkids/mediatoon-secures-rights-to-edens-zero-season-two/)\n\nThis is a French company by the way, I don\u2019t see any record of them having the worldwide rights to other anime and what their procedure is for other markets. In any case it explains the radio silence regarding season 2 from Netflix and others. The show airs in less than 24 hours so unless it\u2019s one of the last 3 shows on Crunchyroll\u2019s boxes it seems like it won\u2019t be simulcasted in the west",

Remember this is  for a French company and other companies all over the world have often required rights to to animes for a language job in their own country alongside the US. Doesn't mean Netflix or another major company doesn't have the rights to release the English dub and sub for us English speaking members of the audience",

It suck\u2019s so hard that these companies can acquire the rights for something and just not release it in countries. I wish the rights holders cared that this company might not release it legal in the biggest western country\n\nDistribution rights really should vary by region if one publisher isn\u2019t willing to release it everywhere\n\nShort season chunks have been really good for the anime industry, but fuck does it feel like it\u2019s screwed with the western rights holding process, outside of the biggest titles it feels like it\u2019s a free for all every time the rights get secured in the west now",

So if they did plan to make a French dub, would make more since for them to have an agreement with Netflix to allow them to dub the first season in French, and then dub the second season in French, possible even allow an outsource deal so Netflix could make the English dub of season 2, and maybe have either temporary rights to put the dub on Netflix along with like Hulu or Disney+, as Netflix does have dubbed shows that are not exclusively Netflix owned stuff, same as Hulu and prime also has English dubbed shows but they did not make the dub themselves.  I guess the entire point is we simply don\u2019t know anything yet other then Netflix did not get the rights to the show outside of Japan.  It\u2019s also entirely likely they will make a English dub with an entire different cast.  At this point who knows.",

So it was not a simalcast, or simaldub by any means.  I hope they do a English dub and I hope they do something to get the same actors, because I would like to give the second season a watch, but if they don\u2019t do a dub or do one without the original cast I will not be watching it, we will just have to wait and see what happens.",

Also  I could be wrong but isn't kondasha have some kind of license for the manga",

Acquiring and distribution rates of Eden Zero backing or earlier in March.  this isn't entirely new and media tune May have acquired the global rights, but that doesn't mean that they would be the only one or that Netflix has lost or won't require the rights to release the official English dub in North America or that another company like Disney Plus won't. Perhaps Netflix won't have the license for other languages that aren't English , Japanese or another language, they could still very much have the rights for North America and English-speaking pee and countries or might be willing to come to some kind of agreement where they share said right streaming licence especially when the anime itself is internationally licensed. And of course Disney plus/Hulu could be a good possibility as well based on what I've heard especially when Disney also have a lot of power and money to release it internationally and english and other languages (with the same respective   casts ) . Also there's been no mention in the articles I'd evidence or any  suggest that Netflix has lost the rights entirely So they could still at least have the North American rates too or be able to strike a deal. Like I said. Also Netflix is sometimes really slow to announce confirmation of a new season at times, but eventually it comes to pass. And of course they do share and licenses. Other distributor companies for shows that they don't exclusively own so there's that.  And of course the English dub of the first season didn't air on Netflix till about 4 months after it's initial release in japan. Anyways, there are still some positive signs and it could still be only a matter of time before we hear more about an official English dub including on Netflix",

Side note : research things have learned in other factors that helped me form my opinion in the comments. I still have hope and  it wouldn't make sense the Japanese studio or distribution company? Not sure that provided the license to any kind of western or english-based company for a used distribution of names dub from a financial and marketing standpoint. Otherwise the Ez anime  not being officially accessible to English audiences could potentially harm  the anime in terms of global viewership ratings  despite How amazing the entire franchise is.

Doesn't mean that Netflix and Hulu still doesn't have the rights to eventually air the English dub and sub for for the English speaking part of the international world. There's also the possibility of it being available on Disney Plus from what I've heard, but we also haven't heard any confirmation that Netflix has lost the rights to everywhere else. Plus Netflix does also feature shows and animes that are owned by other companies and yet they have the full rights Eric. Possible we might see the English dub be released on Netflix and another streaming platform at the same time months later (since the international dubs were available about 4 months after the first season finished or first batch finished airing in Japan. Netflix the other international may not have made an official announcement yet but it's probably only a matter of time, especially if we'll see more Eden's zero in the summer. If not, there is also the option of fan subs that'll probably end up on third party websites as the last resort.

Shounen/shoujo may often have lots of over-exaggeration and unrealistic dialogue. This goes less noticed when you listen to a foreign language since you're not as good at parsing what sounds natural and not, hence the sub vs. dub debate. At least, that's just what I theorize is the reason why dubs of seinen anime might often be regarded as better.",

I saw a seven deadly sins clip of a really infamous moment and I just didn\u2019t like it in sub. I usually do like some of the Japanese voices better. Like jojo.

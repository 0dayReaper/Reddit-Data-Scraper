That show holds up incredibly well.  Great voice acting, but also had forgotten how great the directing is too.  So many little things that just work and so many shots that aren\u2019t the usual wide angle see everything shots; director wasn\u2019t afraid to put the extra work in for odd angle close ups and other shots to keep the interest and focus.",

Honestly, I think I dropped the show twice before I finally (thankfully) watched the whole thing.  Those first few episodes are a GRIND.  In the worst of ways.  At least in my opinion.  Getting through them is a necessary snore.  That said, once you do... This show moves into top tier territory.  I've tried showing steins gate to a few people and the reaction was fairly similar.  SO... I don't think I'm alone in this opinion. Hard show to get people into.  But once you get going... It's worth it.",

            "comment": "After finishing my rewatch of the two seasons, I saw the ***Quintessential Quintuplets*** movie on Monday and found it to be a very satisfying conclusion to the anime.\n\nThe &gt;!'route' structure!&lt; during the festival was a great touch to give each of the girls some time to shine. I was surprised that &gt;!Yotsuba's route!&lt; got me the most emotional, in part because &gt;!the series had never really shown her inner conflict in much detail!&lt;.\n\nFutaro's eventual choice also felt right to me. The film did a good job of keeping me guessing \u2013 basically up until the last moment before the question was resolved, I thought &gt;!he'd choose Itsuki!&lt; . Even though &gt;!Nino is still my favorite, him picking Yotsuba makes sense considering how much she supported him from the get-go!&lt;. As an added bonus, this gives some extra meaning to my favorite scene in season 1: &gt;!Yotsuba's fake confession, which, as it turns out, probably wasn't so fake, after all :&gt; !&lt;.\n\nThe extended epilog, if you can even call it that, perhaps dragged on a little too long. But with how invested I was in all of the characters, I still enjoyed every minute with them. This is what a good movie finale should look like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm in the middle of watching ***Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club***. It's alright, but hasn't gotten me particularly engaged. Perhaps that's due to me coming off of *Quintuplets* and feeling a bit of a void. The show works fine as something cute and inoffensive, at the very least. Best girl for me so far is Ai \u2013 I love her energetic and supportive nature, and her decision to immerse herself in the art of puns is a nice cherry on top (I'm a big fan of wordplay in all shapes and forms).",

Plus, when the story revealed that they met in the past and she was the one who inspired him to take up studying, it definitely seemed like she was meant to be \"the one\".!&lt;\n\nIf you like funny wordplay, you might enjoy Kuma Bear's dub.

            "comment": "Busy week...   \n\n\nGot caught up on the new season of Danmachi ( Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?) - And boy oh boy have things picked up and gotten quite intense.  I feel like the show for me at least has always been good but not great, but it really feels like the stakes have picked up a lot.  Really liking it.    \n\n\nMegumin has been a weekly watch for me.  And, I'm enjoying it.  I'm not sure what I expected with it.  But, it hasn't been that.  That said, it has been enjoyable for what it is.  Which is basically... A comedic slice of life.  It actually feels like it follows the same premise as the Isekai Quartet shows in terms of \"vibe\" vs Konosuba.  Again.  Unexpected.  But, it's enjoyable.  I like it.    \n\n\nEminence in Shadow has also been a weekly watch for me, and I LOVE that show.  I'm going to be sad when it's gone and I have to wait for more... But, thankfully it's not done.  Now THIS is how you subvert the Isekai genre.  This show is so self aware and at the same time so fun.    \n\n\nI watched 4 Episodes of A Lull in the Sea.  Seems like a good enough show, but I stopped watching when I realized I'm not really in the mood for light hearted fun anime right now.  Kind of looking for something darker (If anyone has any recommendations for darker anime I would appreciate it!  Especially of the Death Game variety or just something dark in tone in general.  I feel like I've blown through like 90% of the dubbed anime that fits that vibe.)   I'll go back to watch it at some point.  My sister loves it and is always telling me to watch it, so I feel like I have to go through it at some point.  BUT, just not at all what I'm looking for right now.    \n\n\nWatched 7 episodes of season 2 of Shield Loli... errr... Bofuri.   --- I'm just not enjoying this season as much as the first.  I think the show became far more episodic, which makes it a bit harder as a binge.  It also feels more repetitive this season.  IDK, just not feeling much progression.  I stopped watching for a bit.  Will probably re-visit next week and finish it.   \n\n\nWatched the Quintessential Quintuplets Movie.  BOY did that feel rushed.  Already stated my opinions on this on the official post.  But I just thought it was alright.  Really needed a full season.  And even though I knew who would be the final choice.  I still don't exactly agree with it or even think it made sense.   I PERSONALLY felt it felt forced and almost any of the other girls made more sense.  But... that's my opinion.  And the rushed plot of the movie made it even worse.  (And ironically for a rushed plot.  It at times dragged.  I can't even explain it.)   \n\n\nLastly, while not Dubbed.  I finished watching Bocchi the Rock!  It is a travesty this show did not get the dub treatment, and I hope that is corrected at some point.  I ended up giving it a 9 that I considered a fringe 10.  It was amazing.  I don't really know how to put it, it just needs to be watched to completion.  I do wonder if it will get a sequel season given its huge popularity, and if that will lead it to getting dubbed (Although it was so popular, I could still see it being a backlog dub.  I don't think ANYONE felt it was going to be the hit it was.)",

I've watched it, maybe 4 times, and I'm amazed every time. Im watching 0 for the first time, quite excited for it. \n\nGitS:SAC is possibly the best anime in existence and probably the most realistic look into our future. The dub was cast perfectly. The only dub that comes close is Black Lagoon. \n\nHaganai holds a special place in my heart. Kodaka is basically me in MC form. Same deadpan delivery of words. Same obliviousness to everything around me. The same amount of girls being my only friends in the world. I also think it's cast perfectly.",

Aaron Dismuke slipped right back into Senku like he had been playing the role all his life. His last line in Episode 3 is just AMAZINGLY delivered! Downright shivers up my spine! I mentioned in another thread that Michelle Rojas is doing an excellent job portraying Francois.\n\nTONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You Season 2 - (**A**) Pretty much exactly where we left off with this crew. Nasa's voice does sound a LITTLE deeper than the last time, but it's not enough to take me out of the show. Very well done.\n\nMy Clueless First Friend - (**B+**) It's a solid dub with great writing, but Tank-Top Bro's voice might be a LITTLE too deep for my tastes considering the character is supposed to be in elementary school.\n\nA Galaxy Next Door - (**B**) Just your typical good job from Crunchyroll/Funimation. Nothing really much to write home about. Everyone does their job.\n\nHell's Paradise - (**B**) It's okay. Again, just a safe typical job from Crunchyroll/Funimation. Nothing offensive or out of the ordinary and no real standouts here.\n\nSasaki and Miyano -  (**A+**) I'm late to this one, but dang it, this dub is AMAZING. I mean, downright flawless! Kellen Goff as Sasaki is just PERFECT and probably one of the best casting decisions in anime. He makes the character just so relatable and natural. Some might get annoyed with his \"pouty voice\", but I'm not one of them. Joshua Waters as Miyano is equally as good. He does such a great job, I thought he was one of Funimation's old vets!\n\nHeavenly Delusion - (**B+**) - Not a bad dub at all. Nothing really stands out about it so far, but everyone is doing a really good job in it! The writing is great too!",

There were plenty of scenes from the later seasons I had forgotten, so it still felt fresh. The battle scenes from season 3 were the best in the whole series, and that finale was epic - for me, it was second only to Aang vs Ozai from the original series. \n\nMy feelings about season 4 was a bit mixed, much like season 2, but overall positive. I didn't find the villain nearly as interesting as the previous ones, but the main plot itself was very well done and led to some great worldbuilding. I really enjoyed Korra's journey &gt;!of recovery!&lt; in the beginning and what that meant for her character, but there were also times when it felt like the subject wasn't handled very well &gt;!with others saying that Korra is \"holding herself back\" on purpose when she's clearly suffering from trauma, plus the remaining poison in her system that a novice metalbender understandably couldn't detect if even a master in the art missed it.!&lt; \n\nMany of the characters had excellent development, though Team Avatar still suffered from the issues created in season 2 that were never really repaired. However, Varrick and Zhu Li are comedy gold and they deserve their own spin-off series. I would watch another four seasons of just them. \n\n**Rating: 9/10** for season 3 and **8.5/10** for season 4. My scores averaged about 8.5 for all seasons.\n\n**Tsurune season 1 &amp; OVA** - I enjoyed this one even more than expected. The main cast have a nice dynamic and it was fun watching their friendship develop, plus the kyudo scenes were a real highlight. I was most invested in Minato's and Masaki's stories in particular, and the emotional payoff at the end was great. I've already started season 2 (not dubbed), and it's just as good as the first so far. **Rating: 8.5/10**\n\n**Sugar Apple Fairy Tale** - I was so happy when it showed up on Amazon Prime Video (wondered for a while if I'd ever get to watch it again when Crunchyroll stopped working), I rewatched the whole show again. And technically, I saw the last episode for the first time. It's basically the fantasy anime I've always wanted, with a really creative world and beautiful art, and I love the relationship between Anne and Challe - their banter is just so fun to watch. The English dub is fantastic as well. Anne and Challe have such great chemistry, Mithril Lid Pod's voice suits him very well, and Jonas has the same VA who played Floch in Attack on Titan which is oddly fitting for the sort of character he is.\n[Episode 12] &gt;!may have been a heartbreaking, massive cliffhanger!&lt; but even so, this winter anime has easily become a favorite of mine. **Rating: 9.5/10**",

I'd really appreciate it if there are any suggestions for anything similar (read: tearjerker) but as a full series.",

            "comment": "I just finished up watching \"Recovery of an MMO Junkie\" and it was honestly a lot more enjoyable than I expected. The voices worked well, especially Ian Sinclare hamming it up and I'd whole heartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun, low stakes romcom. Sadly the author had to stop working on the manga for health reasons so we'll never get more of the story, but what we do have is good at least.\n\nHonestly, leaves me in the mood for more office romance-esq anime although I don't know many.",

            "comment": "Just finished up Trapped in a Dating Sim and that was a fun one for me, had a good story, Leon was always making me laugh out loud at just how done he was with the dumb game and it's people but still tried to make everything work out, and good character development. I'm hoping a season 2 rolls around. And I've been getting back into the Eminence in Shadow since the dub just finished up on Hidive and off the bat it's popping off, I'm only up to episode 6 but it's been really good and sucks you right into it. The funny this is is how similar these 2 shows are like: 1 they both focus on an OP guy that got isekaid, 2 they both just want to be a guy in the background but somehow end up being in the middle of everything. So if you have good recommendations that are like the above similarities mentioned let me know",

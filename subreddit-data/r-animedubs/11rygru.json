One day, a voice actress named Lani Minella (who has voiced in a number of PC and video games since the 90s and early 2000s, including one Rouge the Bat), encouraged Casey to really pursue VO. They've been working on their career for a number of years, but it wasn't until 2017 when they've finally made the move to Los Angeles (thanks to a generous benefactor - [full story here](https://youtu.be/ybrnfiFf_VE?t=300), source from u/chrismayek interview)\n\nMy def fave roles that Casey has voiced is easily the ones where their character leaves you feeling something by the end of the episode or the show. (Still kicking myself for not having seen EVA yet) Definitely with the vulnerable and emotional. But also love it when they get to have a little fun too. And with a distinctive voice like theirs, def gonna be hearing Casey for a while.\n\nWhat are your favorite roles?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Theoto Rikka** (86) [This scene in particular](https://youtu.be/IAJr2CwLXM4) lived in my mind the rest of that year, and would you believe it if he got this all in one long take?\n\n\\- **Emporio** (JJBA Stone Ocean)\n\n\\- **Haru Shirokane** (Tribe Nine)\n\n\\- **Nene Onemine** (Komi CAn't Communicate)",

Hell, it's the reason I stopped watching the Netflix dub of *Evengelion* after the first episode.\n\nWhich is too bad, because my first experience with them was as the radio DJ in [the WRVR mod for *Fallout 4*](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12377/) and their VA work in that mod is amazing. If they did more roles like that than I'd be more open to hearing them in anime.",

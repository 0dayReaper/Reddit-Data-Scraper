    "postText": "So I started watching Bleach several years ago. I really enjoyed it until they started cramming whole seasons of filler into arrancar arc and I bounced really hard off of one of them and just stopped watching. So my question(s) is, should I go back and give Bleach another shot? Are there certain arcs that I should skip to enjoy the show? I really liked the concept of the show and I want to like it but GD some of those filler arcs crammed into the middle good cannon arcs killed me.",

I grew up seeing an episode here or there, but never got into it like other anime shows as a kid. \n\nIf they treated the OG Bleach run the way they\u2019re treating TYBW, it\u2019d be one of the best shows of all time lmao. OG Bleach is definitely worth it, but IMO skipping filler is a must to get through it. The canon episodes drag out enough on their own. Once you\u2019re done you can go back to watch a filler arc if you want.\n\nBottom line - the high points of Bleach are amazing and up there with some of the great shonen. Definitely worth it. But the low points are so low lmao, really have to have some patience unfortunately.",

Looks like any content that was not on crunchyroll that was just on VRV is now on Crunchy...  And those with VRV subscriptions still will be automatically migrated to Crunchyroll.\n\nVRV finally being killed off.  End of an era.  (Not that the final nail in the coffin wasn't already pretty much in place.)  News from tuesday, but didn't see anyone post about it.",

So... Not a lot.  \n\nYeah I'm starting to get annoyed that we're still waiting for Funimation to be completely moved over.  They said something like 98% should be able to come over. With 2% being stuck in licensing hell (mostly because the original licensees went defunct and the agreement was only for funimation.) Selector is really the biggest Funimation title left that I liked that hasn't made the move.  And some of the index/Railgun stuff (dubs) - both kind of surprising because crunchy has seasons of both on it.",

Maybe not enough cancelled and so they\u2019re taking their time. Who knows but I agree it\u2019s very annoying. \n\nI was holding off on watching Shiki until it came over to CR, instead of resubbing to Funimation, and now it\u2019s not on Funimation or any other site. Lost in unlicensed hell. Ffs.",

Watched a couple shows not on Crunchyroll and no longer felt it was worth keeping even if there are some shows I enjoyed that are yet to be in crunchy.  Just gotta hope they make the move soon.  \n\nBut yeah.  Telling people to cancel when they did was a little bit of jumping the gun for sure.",

It established the rules and guidelines of the universe.  While gradually introducing you to the elements you need to know.  \n\nRailgun is a spinoff of Index.  And while chronologically it comes first.  It's a prequel.  So it assumes you know a bit of what's going on and why. \n\nI generally recommend against a straight chronological order watch and usually suggest watching in either release order or a hybrid.  But..  I get why people recommend it. \n\nIt's the same reason I won't tell people to start watching star wars with episode 1.",

            "comment": "This post came up about a month ago here haha\n\nThe Toaru universe of anime is arguably in my top 2 of all anime.  I have watched all the seasons of the shows many times. \n\nHere is my copy and pasted answer to this I have provided more times than I can count:\n\nAs someone that has rewatched the series several times and all the eps... And has tried different orders.  Do NOT watch in chronological order or you'll just be confused.  Watch it in this order, which seemed to provide the best experience.  (I also tried it with a new viewer and they greatly preferred this order) \n\nIndex I, Railgun, Railgun S, Accelerator, Index II, Index Movie, Railgun T. Index III.\n\nYou'll enjoy your experience much more that way and be less confused.  If also results in you having a lot more surprises this way. And having far greater impact.  \n\n(I recommend this order much like I would recommend a new viewer of star wars not start with episode I.  You'll see why.)\n\n\nChronological order can be confusing because it will assume you know things you don't. (And ends up in a disjointed viewing experience with a lot of back and forth) - I'd try to explain it but I'd have to create a whole wiki just to do that lol.\n\nRelease order works but I think can be a drag and also reveals things early that have more of an impact if you watch the way I suggested.  And you won't be (as) confused haha. (Release order is Index I, Railgun, Index II, Railgun S, The Movie, Index III, Accelerator, Railgun T) \n\nWatching each series separately is NOT optimal because you WILL be confused.  It will assume you know things you do not know.  It will diminish the impact of certain revelations.  It will make you care less about some characters you really will care about knowing more of their backstory.  (The amount of confused folk that have only seen Railgun or only Index or only Accelerator is a dime a dozen --- Don't be one of them.) \n\nThat said the order I provided will definitely provide optimal experience with less confusion.",

I can muster through the VA, but are the heroines throughout the series mostly Lolis? I don't like to read too much about the plot because I don't want to spoil the series, but anyone can see it's going to be a harem scenario. Also should I watch Index up until episode 9 then do Railgun, Rail Gun S, Accelerator and then finish 10-24? I might be doing it because I can't get into Index and seen people say similar things about it.",

I wouldn't do it that way.  \n\nThe characters are teenagers for the most part or younger teens.  And there are a bunch of loli characters on the show.  If you don't like that... It's not gonna get much better. \n\nIt's really not a harem show honestly. No more than Sword Art Online is a \"harem show\"",

This is the best order since the anime producer made it this way.",

Einar screaming \"I'll fucking kill you!\" is just so perfect (thank you Ian Sinclair).\n\nOne thing I love about the manga translation is that it curses a lot and to me that really fits the series (ironically neither of this episode's f-bombs are in the manga). It's something I appreciated about the Sentai S1 dub (though netflix did also have one f-bomb).",

Its not like the show was directed by different people so why leaving arguably the less important ones but during more serious scenes you change it? Maybe im just reading in to it too deeply.",

That goes for that woman beating coward Ketil too. He deserves to lose everything as well.",

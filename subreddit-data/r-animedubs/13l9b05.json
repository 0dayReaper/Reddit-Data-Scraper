And for Will O\u2019s Voice Actor, yeah he definitely gets a new voice cause for his original VA, I take it you know the rest.",

She sounds just about the same as before, and I guess it wouldn't be too surprising if this is true since Cris George seems to be pretty good at bringing back whoever he can for certain roles (or even casting certain VAs who haven't gotten any new roles in ages, like Alex Organ in SpyFam). Same goes for Jeremy Inman.\n\nAs for the Wisp, I feel like I've heard his new voice somewhere else before, but I can't quite place it.",

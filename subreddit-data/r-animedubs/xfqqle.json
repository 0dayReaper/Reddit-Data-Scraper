I played the first region\u2019s story and some of the second back in the April, but I\u2019ve been thinking about getting in to again recently. I assume the anime will cover the first region\u2019s story which feels doable in a single cour. The English cast will more than likely be brought back in full, especially since most have done at least one role and many others are regulars.\n\nAlso interested to see whether the show chooses the male or female protagonist. Typically in this situation I think it\u2019s the male that is used, but it could be interesting to see the female instead.\n\nEdit: Here's some VAs I would expected to see in the anime, their character and a few notable roles in anime.\n\n|VA|Genshin|Notable Anime Roles|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Zach Aguilar|Aether (Male Protag)|Tanjirou Kamado (Demon Slayer), Genos (OPM), Kouichi Hirose (Jojo)|\n|Corina Boettger|Paimon|Tatsumaki (OPM, S2), |\n|Kelly Baskin|Amber|Airi Amano (D4DJ)|\n|Erika Harlacher|Venti|Shinobu Kouchou (Demon Slayer)|\n|Sean Chiplock|Diluc|Subaru Natsuki (Re:Zero), Guido Mista, (Jojo)|\n|Stephanie Southerland|Jean|Garf's Mother (Re:Zero), |\n|Laura Stahl|Barbara|Iruma Suzuki (Ikruma-kun), Ray (The Promised Neverland)|",

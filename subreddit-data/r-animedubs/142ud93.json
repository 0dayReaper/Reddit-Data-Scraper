Quite literally, I received the audition the day after I arrived. At the time, I didn't have an agent and only a couple credits to my name...\" \\~* [Suzie Yeung, April 2021](https://twitter.com/SuzieYeung/status/1381998969971077124)\n\n*\"I love Yuffie so much I just spent 30 mins writing about the intricacies and layers of her character and idk may post about it one day  Btw it\u2019s been exactly 3 years since I got the audition for her\" \\~* [Suzie Yeung, June 2023](https://twitter.com/SuzieYeung/status/1665576625617129472?s=20)\n\nBeen waiting a while to do this one: Probably one of the biggest breakouts in anime VO in the past three years, and one of my personal top 3 all-time VAs, the every so talented, the very sweet, and overall Best Bean: **Suzie Yeung**. \n\nHer very first role she booked was on Sound Cadence's Kemono Friends, and at the time, she was still living, working, and going to school in Boston. But as if fate were calling to her, she packed up and moved to Tx and then eventually moved to LA. And for any proof that this is what she was meant to do with her life, as mentioned above, just one day she got into LA, she got the audition for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade as Yuffie. Already a solid staple on the LA side of CR dubs, as well as Netflix anime and video games. From roles that will make you get on your knees and bark like a dog, to the bestest of best beans, to strong and virtuous, and the must-protecs. A talented person in the booth and just as a nice of a person outside the booth as well in conventions or when streaming.\n\n(Personal story: Suzie Yeung was the very first VA i've ever met at a convention. I've never been to a convention before, and my introverted ass doesn't like giantass crowds. But I went to one in my area, and she was the first VA I've ever met and intertacted with. And I mean it, she really is the nicest person.)\n\nWhat are your favorite roles?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Makima** (Chainsaw Man): [This... just all of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awT2Qy4sM8w). \n\n\\- **Yuffie** (Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade): Fun fact, I've never played a single FF game until I've seen her stream FF7R, and it inspired me to pick it up for the first time, similar story, watching Erika Harlacher stream P5R inspired me to pick up Persona for the first time in my life. \n\nSuzie makes Yuffie so much fun, so much personality, and very emotional when it hit too. Like if I had to pick up one role that would represent the best of Suzie Yeung, it would be Yuffie.\n\n\\- **Vladilena Miliz\u00e9** (86): One of my favorite characters of 2021: compassionate to the 86 when no one else would be, and fierce (Especially with the \"WHO GIVES A SHIT\" line). Another one of her best.\n\n\\- **Jing Xialian** (Appare-Ranman): One of my favorite roles she's voiced, reminding me of a certain kickass Chinese character breaking gender barriers. Def the role that started making me a big fan of hers.\n\n\\- **Yuri Honj\u014d** (High-Rise Invasion)\n\n\\- **Sumi Sakurazawa** (Rent a Girlfriend)\n\n\\- **Eula Lawrence** (Genshin Impact)\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\n\\- **Erika** (Akebi's Sailor Uniform)\n\n\\- **Ayumu Uehara** (Love Live Nijigasaki)",

Of course, she was also excellent at making Makima so quietly intimidating.\n\nI didn't like 86, but the entire cast was excellent and Suzie as Lena was no exception. Really amazing and emotional performance even though I didn't end up watching the whole show.\n\nShe also voiced Qiao Ling in Link Click which was phenomenal all around.\n\nAs an aside, I also met her at a convention once and she was so kind and fun to talk to. She's certainly an awesome person and I look forward to seeing her in more roles!",

I also think her takes on Eula and Makima are significantly better than the JP counterparts.\n\nThat said, I also have a soft spot for Telolilo in Fabiniku. I'm really looking forward to hearing her performance as Rixia and Nadia in Trails Into Reverie.",

I'll still probably end up preferring Netflix's take on Sweyn when they eventually cover this part (I just love Price's voice), but still, that was a solid comeback. And hey, Christopher Guerrero as Wulf! Solid ass choice.",

I was pleasantly surprised how well he did here. That sinister tone of voice and evil laugh at the end in Canute's quarters were REALLY well done, imo.",

It\u2019s crazy to see how much he\u2019s changed to get him to this point now. I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s voicing King Sweyn if it\u2019s still Luis Galindo or not, but they did a great job with those scenes with Canute. Also I hadn\u2019t seen this brought up before, but I really appreciate them getting Jason Douglas back to voice the narrator.",

I'm not sure if Sentai or Sound Cadence have cut ties with him yet but I sure damn hope he will not be getting any voice acting or directing roles ever again.",

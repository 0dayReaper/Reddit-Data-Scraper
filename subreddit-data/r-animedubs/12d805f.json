    "postText": "Weather its because you grew up watching it dubbed on Toonami or 4Kids, the dub is too iconic, or you just weren't feeling the Japanese cast. What are some shows you just can't watch in Japanese for its me its Yu-Gi-Oh, Yu-Gi-Oh GX, and Sonic X I usually hate censorship and usually go out of my way to watch something uncensored but I'll put up with 4Kids censorship just so I can watch them dubbed which is also the reason I'll probably never watch GX S4 cause it was never dubbed.\n\nNaruto/Boruto, One Piece, and Black Clover if I want to stare at the bottom of the screen and read subtitles for over 500 episodes then I'll read the manga for long running shouen series I like to sit back relax and enjoy the journey I'm going on not staring at the bottom of the screen and Asta's JP voice instantly put me off and waited for Funimation to dub it before watching it.\n\nZatch Bell this was my favorite anime growing up before I even knew what anime was and the dub cast are the voices of these characters to me plus Zatch sounds like a 12 year old girl in the Japanese and all the changes VIZ made minus the censorship of course enhanced the series the music atleast from what I've heard is better than the original Japanese OST and the flames matching the books was a nice touch imo. Like a bit ago I watch the first Bao Zakeruga in Japanese cause I saw it on YT and maybe I'm blinded by nostalgia but it wasn't hitting the same as the dub.\n\nDragon Ball, Soul Eater, and The Devil is a Part Timmer these dubs are just too iconic for me to watch them in Japanese and in the case of Dragon Ball Goku's JP voice just doesn't sound right to me.",

I'm just not gonna watch subbed 98% of the time.  And the only times I really do if this is the case is to see the examples of people complaining about the dubs vs subs and seeing if it's warranted. Correct.  Or rational. (As someone that can speak a fair amount of Japanese and understand it.... Usually it's not.  Because the dub - outside of some jokes that express similar meaning (localization) - usually has the same meaning or intent as the sub. \n\nI'm a native English speaker.  As long as the intent/meaning of translation is correct to the source material...  I'd rather watch a visual medium than read a visual medium lol. And while I can sit there and translate to some extent while doing subs.  I just find the whole experience less than ideal given the option. \n\nSo.  That's the answer.  I see no point of watching subs if something is dubbed",

It's like getting to watch a show you liked all over again with enough of a difference to make it feel new, yet familiar.  Why wouldn't you want that?  Sounds like some of you just can't read/don't like reading.  Which is perfectly fine.\n\nI will, however, turn back to a dub if a VA just doesn't bring the same level of impact.  Perfect example of this is Bluelock.  Got caught up in the Dub on crunchyroll, still wanted more. So I switched to the sub and started at the beginning.  Except the head of the Bluelock program guy sounded way, way less enthusiasticly psychopathic and just didn't hit the same.  And that guy was a big driving force behind the series being so awesome.  So its back to the dub in that situation.\n\nBut some shows are genuinely awesome in both dub and sub.  Haikyu is great in both. So is Attack on Titan, though I think the yelling hits harder in the sub than the dub.  Black Clover is also good subbed or dubbed.\n\nI think i just like anime lol.",

There's also the characters sounding completely different in Japanese, such as Dan blatantly sounding like a girl, which definitely threw me off at first because the dub defines his character more by a long shot, but I feel like I could get used to that.\n\nEDIT: Actually, there's at least one other show I have no shame whatsoever in refusing to watch in dub: Love is War.

Going forward, I sorta flipped-flopped based on whether a show even had a dub at all and rarely went to sub first if I had other options. I noticed that 9/10 the reason I didn't like a dub was bc I'd listened to it subbed for too long so nowadays I give shows a 1-4 minute test run in either language to see which one i prefer right out the gate and I usually stick with whichever I pick the first time around. This is how I chose Tomo-chan's/To Your Eternity's/Nanbaka's dubs and Tokyo 24th Ward's/Chainsaw Man's/Sakugan's subs. Usually tho, the quality isn't so vastly worse off in one direction so I'll still end up rewatching a scene or full episodes if I'm blown away by a certain performance and want to hear how the other actors did. It's neat being able to pick and choose like that \\^\\^",

If you want \"purity\" - Turn off subs and don't use dubs and go watch some anime.  Because that's the only way you're going to get \"purity\" and \"the intent of the creator.\"  Both subs and dubs are english adaptions and translations.  And as a language that doesn't always translate completely well or accurately into english (meaning the translator may need to take some liberties in conveying meaning.) -Some things will always be lost along the way.  I've seen subs many times that I just did NOT agree with what the sub said vs what I heard spoken.  I can understand a fair amount of japanese (enough to get by and even be reasonably conversational - although I'm by no means native or even close...)  So I still need subs because I don't know it all.  But there are times where I'm just like no. No that's not right at all.  If they want \"purity.\" Go become fluent in japanese.  Turn off subs.  Don't watch dubs.  And get your \"purity.\"   \n\n\nAs a native english speaker, I always prefer to watch or have things in my native language if possible.  Because unlike with Japanese (or any other language - I do know a few languages reasonably well) - I don't have to THINK about it with english.  And with subs... It's just a distraction.  Especially in a very visual medium like anime which... The art itself is part of the depiction.",

Their food, their customs, their social situation.\n\nIf the intent is to stay \"pure\" then the only pure way to watch most of them is to actively be a Japanese citizen with a long history among the Japanese people and practices.

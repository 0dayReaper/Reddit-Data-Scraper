The MC is placed in the corpse of the legendary hero (who's death was unintentionally caused by him) by a necromancer.\n\n\nDead Mount Death Play : The necromancer known as The Corpse God reincarnates himself into the corpse of the newly deceased teen boy Polka Shinoyama. Polka was killed due to a hit job. That's all I'm gonna say just know I highly recommend this new series!\n\n\nYa Boy Kongming! : Tactical genius Kongming is reincarnated in modern day Japan. He uses his genius tactician skills to make Eiko (a newbie singer) rise to stardom.",

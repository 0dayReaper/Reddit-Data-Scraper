Maybe for funsies, but have a drink during the zoom call and drink and be merry along side them too.\n\nAnd loved the new years fluff. Wishing good luck, plenty of more interations, blossoming relationships, and future business opportunities and successes for the next year.",

Loved the camaraderie in the virtual meet up and the silliness of its ending. Plus all three couples get great moments together. Also, little sister knows how to manipulate her brother well lol.",

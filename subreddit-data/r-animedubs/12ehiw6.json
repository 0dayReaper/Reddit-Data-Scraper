                    "comment": "*season 1 + 2 spoiler warning*\n\nSeason 1 felt really good, the power creep on the shield hero was self balanced by a few reasons.\n\nFirstly, it made sense given how there were numerous ways to improve your character and weapon stats, and the shield hero focused more on versatility and the rage shield.\n\nAnd even then, he only became op because of the rage shield, which burned his Allie\u2019s as well as cursing his own soul, it had a steep price every time he used the power (but season 2 created plot armor for the rage shield just so he could be op for the sake of it)\n\nMore importantly, (returning to the main topic at hand) the Natsumi in season 1 couldn\u2019t\u2019ve become the shield hero we came to love without the others\n\nThe Spear Hero (and his lackeys) being the biggest reason the shield learns of the rage shield, learns that this isn\u2019t just a game or fantasy Isekai, and learns to rely on his party for everything he does (and compliments their weaknesses with his strengths)\n\nWhile the other two created numerous problems throughout the world (inadvertently and unintentionally) as a result of them not realizing that actions have consequences that need to be considered.\n\nThen, even though Natsumi became stronger than the others end of s1, he still couldn\u2019t win without them. The others became fundamental Allie\u2019s in overcoming the pope, as well as taking care of the wave, allowing him to focus on the hero\u2019s from another world.\n\nS1, Natsumi only became what he was and was able to succeed thanks to the other heroes, and even at the end of season 1\u2026 while the others weren\u2019t quite as powerful as Natsumi, they weren\u2019t weak either.\n\nThen season 2 said (let\u2019s make the others absolute useless pieces of garbage and absolute shit\u2026 because plot reasons\u2026) which was among the many reasons why s2 failed so ducking hard.\n\nIn otherwords, s2 is an excellent example as to what happens if we ignore the other heroes and make them out like shitheads, solely because we want to put the mc on a pedestal (among its many other flaws)\n\ntl;dr I\u2019m really hoping they bring the others back into the spotlight, and showcase how cool and integral they are in the plot, and not just throw them away as filler background extras",

Also, the pacing was jarring and the animation, my god there were so many obvious errors. Normally you have to comb through frames but I saw them all in real time. It\u2019s incomprehensible how pretty much everything was  a downgrade compared to S1 when they spent so much time and money hyping it up. \n\nThe season really could\u2019ve used a delay to improve the animation and more episodes to flesh out everything that happens after S1, so they can fix the pacing in what we did get. Don\u2019t even get me started on how they used the other heroes. Ugh. Watching S2 you could easily pick when and where corners were cut. That\u2019s not good. Whatever problems caused all this, hopefully their regrets have made them stronger.",

I agree that it was definitely rushed, and that would honestly be my main complaint about the season.\n\nBut was the animation really that bad? An obvious downgrade from season 1, but I dunno. I just feel like the animation wasn\u2019t as bad as a lot of people were making it out to be. But maybe my standards are just lower because I\u2019m an Overlord fan, lol.\n\nAnyways, yeah, I definitely understand why people didn\u2019t like the season, but I was just saying that I\u2019m not quite sure if I would put it anywhere near the level of TPN 2 or Tokyo Ghoul:Re, which I\u2019ve seen quite a few people doing. But to each their own, of course.",

Having to stare at characters that look like they\u2019ve just seen visions of hell for 3 seconds straight is a bit distracting. Little Raphtalia was a particularly high volume victim as I recall. The framing of action sequences felt worse (simpler) than before, that\u2019s another part of the rush job. There\u2019s also the turtle and monster horde CGI, but that\u2019s whatever. \n\nWhen it comes to the pacing, I heard that even in the source material the first half arc that was covered is not very good, so I can understand the show trying to just get it over with and move on. First season was a slow burn but S2 is two super quick arcs. But S2 desperately needed like an extra half cour to flesh out the in-between connecting where things were left off, as well as show what\u2019s happening outside the core group more often. Side characters would disappear and appear at random it felt like, including the main antagonist. It was hard to keep track of who was doing what and when. It was such a mess having the other heroes\u2019 entire ordeal be entirely encapsulated by \u201coh they were sent ahead\u201d to \u201coops looks like they got caught\u201d to \u201cwelp see ya later hope you do okay\u201d. They got done dirty. \n\nAlso, when I say things were confusing at the beginning, I had to look stuff up because I knew I wasn\u2019t quite getting what characters were talking about. Everything with Eclair was entirely skipped over, like I missed her intro or something. That was one of my biggest sources of confusion early on. Maybe don\u2019t spend entire scenes vaguely alluding to her hidden backstory. Her character could\u2019ve been replaced with some generic military general dude and that would\u2019ve made things better. What didn\u2019t help is that S2 also had to introduce new lore for other countries and an entire other world in half the time that S1 had. When people say S2 is super boring, it\u2019s because it feels rushed and bloated at the same time.",

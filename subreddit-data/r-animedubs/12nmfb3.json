Really well done, and a beautiful movie from Makoto Shinkai . Didn't hit me emotionally as hard as other anime films I've watched. But it was visually wonderful to watch. And I greatly enjoyed the dub of it.",

            "comment": "I hope her aunt gets with convertible dude lol. Daikin was also adorable. Him and the other cat reminded me of my dogs. My one dog constantly licks my other like the black cat was in the car lol.\n\nWhile the fantasy / supernatural aspects were my favorite of the disaster trilogy, this is probably my least favorite of the 3. I still loved it a lot though 9/10. Maybe it will change after some rewatches or an all 3 marathon later on. Weathering with you is just my favorite with its fuck the world I choose you resolution, and your name just has a better overall story and mystery to me.\n\nBut I really enjoyed the interactions with side characters. I thought Suzume's journey was really beautiful and meaningful. Each interaction and friend she made along the way truly felt like they mattered, adding more levity to each potential earthquake and door. I just wish we got more insight into what the worm was and the cats. Or how she wandered through as a child.\n\nDon't really get why the black cat decided to make her aunt say those things though. I guess he was pissed that Daijin was shirking its duties maybe.\n\nOh and the chair was surpringly dynamic and expressive. It was a cute idea. Loved watching it run.\n\n\nI really want to see it again lol. And really appreciate the animation now that I know the story.",

            "comment": "I liked and appreciated this film and its artistry, but it didn't have near the impact of Your Name or Weathering With You For Me.\n\nThat is fundamentally due to the relationship between the two leads just not being as compelling. I see two reasons for this:\n\n1. The story focusing much less on the relationship, more plot-intensive. Whereas the previous two outings were built on the central relationship(s), with the disaster essentially coming in part-way through to drive conflict in those relationships, disaster is the focus from the get go. This felt like it left less time for the relationship to develop organically.\n\nNow, not focusing on romance is fine, but the story still wants to lean on it too much at the end of the day. As with the lat two films, our last portion is a mad dash to save a loved one after they have been killed by a supernatural phenomenon. That just doesn't work or hit as hard here because the central pairing isn't as well developed.\n\n2) Souta feels underdeveloped to me in general. While Suzume gets a lot of development and personality, Souta kind of suffers as a character. There is enough of a sense of what they're going for - a man trapped by his duty and unable to live life to the fullest. But this gets expressed by other characters around Souta, not the man himself. The man himself seems resigned most of the movie, and only in fleeting moments in its climaxes do we get much vulnerability from him.\n\nThere was an opportunity to have Souta's laments for his situation, or perhaps to express some envy or resentment for the relative freedom Suzume seems to have. But we don't get that much from him, with him just driven by just wanting his body back. In general, his curse would have tied more interestingly to his character development; \"if all you want is to devote your life to this duty, why not just become a keystone and do it forever? Why do you even need a body?\" That is perhaps there in subtext, but I feel like it could have been more to the surface to make him more compelling and drive the main relationship.\n\nIt had its moments and the road trip bits were fun. The last scene, with Suzume talking to her younger self, was beautiful. The concepts and theming around the dead places and the memories embedded within them is compelling.\n\nBut without a strong enough relationship at its core, it just didn't soar for me. The film may have been better off removing the trappings of romance, or else needed to devote more to it.",

                    "comment": "I agree it was the romance angle was not as developed as the last two films he made. Which is why I think they were better. Still I like Suzume as a character and her  relationship with her aunt. The animation was gorgeous. I liked the themes about life included. Suzume journey meeting people and the locations were awesome. \n\nThe sweetest part though that made me tear up was the reveal that it was Suzume who talked to her younger self. It was heart warming to tell herself how much she had to look forward to. I must say though your comment about Souta not feeling much and is detached. \n\nI wonder why Suzume fell in love with him as I watched? You comment reflects that many of the characters are detached from living. They formed those attachments. Even guardian cat was seeking attachment. I would say attachments to others is one of Makoto Shinkai's themes no matter which way it goes. \n\nYour comment gave me some new perspective on the movie. Fun thing about this it was my first anime film since I was a kid that my mother tagged along with and she liked it.",

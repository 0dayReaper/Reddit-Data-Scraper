Same with Felecia Angelle with her role as Mana in Date A Live IV.",

I think apart from the sequels, she will probably never appear in the new anime dubs and at least she might focus on dubbing japanese/anime type games like Genshin Impact, JRPG games from Atlus or Nintendo, or maybe an indie Visual Novel, lets hope that she still appear in anime dubbing from Sound Cadence Studios, Okratron 5000 and Kocha Studios.",

I know it wasn't her first big role but my first time hearing Risa Mei was as Futaba Igarashi and after reading that series for years now she absolutely killed it for me. Would love to hear her in more dubs, and since Crunchy is top dog it would be a real shame if they don't chill out with remote recording",

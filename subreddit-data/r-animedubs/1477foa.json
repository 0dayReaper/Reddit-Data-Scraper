If she gets over the crippling trauma of being Among Us'd, that is.\n\nThe one small consolation for Suletta is most of the people who betrayed her (Guel, Miorine, Eri-L) are doing it out of concern for her. Prospera's just mean.\n\nEri-L said that Suletta is clone like the rest of the sisters, which now begs the question of who/where the other clones are. I wonder if there's a clone in each drone?\n\nI also notice that while Eri and all the Eri-sisters have blue-white Permet glows, Suletta's permet glow is red, like everyone else in the series.\n\nI at least can see why Prospera is so messed up inside. Not long after her husband sacrificed himself to save her, her daughter does the same and now all that remains of Prospera's family is the corpse of her little girl. It must have made her ecstatic to the point of craziness when she discovered Eri was now some kind noncorporeal consciousness, and she'll do everything to make sure she doesn't die again.\n\nAlso just finished System Shock and I'm scared of digital ghosts.",

I think we know what Suletta's piloting next.\n\nThe important question will be wether Suletta shares Eris Ability to Pilot gundams without drawbacks. The fact that shes a Clone makes it Seem very possible.\n\n&gt; The one small consolation for Suletta is most of the people who betrayed her (Guel, Miorine, Eri-L) are doing it out of concern for her. Prospera's just mean.\n\nTbf the Episode ends with Prospera suggesting that they could still Take Suletta along before agreeing with Eri that she should be free so unless shes Just lying to save face with Eri (who, as we know, genuinely Cares about Suletta) she does actually Care more than it seemed previously\n\n&gt; I also notice that while Eri and all the Eri-sisters have blue-white Permet glows, Suletta's permet glow is red, like everyone else in the series.\n\nI think its important to Note that that happened specifically when Eri triggered it. We know that its Not Just Permet Score 8 because that also happened last Episode and Suletta was fine. As i Said the fact that shes Eris Clone should mean that Sulettas also capable of damageless Gundam Control.",

                                    "comment": "I guess thats possible but id say that what we've Seen speaks against that.\n\nDuring the Prologue we See that Eri is capable of achieving 100% Synchronisation with L'frith with No signs of drawbacks. Eri was 4 years old so Theres 0 Chance she was Just toughing it Out. If piloting Lfrith would have hurt we wouldve Known (tbf that only confirms she can do it *painless* which is Not necessarily *damageless* but its still more than Any Other character has displayed)\n\nMore importantly. Prospera explicitly tells us that Eri died because of Space, Not because of L'frith.\n\nSpace is filled with radiation thats deadly to Humans and while its fair to assume that space Stations have Ample protection against it L'frith is a Combat machine so it propably only has light defenses in that regard since its Not Made for Long Time exposurse which is exactly what happened when Elnora and Eri Had to use it to get from the Station to Mercury.\n\nSpace also doesnt have gravity which we know has adverse effects on humans (mainly bone degredation iirc).\n\nEri was 4 and she spent an extended period of time Exposed to both These Things in a Machine with (propably) minimal protection and minimal First aid opportunities which (imo) is what Killed her.",

A lot of the dubs for children around that time have only ever been released as standard definition as the masters weren't kept. Medabots comes to mind being one of the few things released on SD Blu-ray",

Unless they maintained the animation files and could re-render it in HD (something that almost never happens), 480p is pretty much all you can get. Traditionally upscaling has had very mixed results and AI upscaling is still a new frontier. \n\nCapcom said they'll be streaming NT Warrior's second season, Axess, which never had a home video release. I assume they've sourced the broadcast masters for this.",

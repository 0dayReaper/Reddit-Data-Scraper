How did these idiots think this was going to work out for them? The police were absolutely useless while someone was literally being strangled to death in front of them. Oh and then the siblings feel bad after their defeat and change their ways.  It\u2019s not absurd in a good way. \n\nI get the wish fulfillment and fantasy trip style of this story, but it unfolds in such an unnatural way. Jobless Reincarnation is darker but it at least makes the psychological elements more believable.",

            "comment": "Well, at least they updated the credits with Luci Christian voicing Okachimachi. But that's it. No one else getting credited. Just my guess, I think Mr. Suehiro is voiced by Blake Sheppard. \n\nSpeaking of Ocachimachi, I liked the twist of having her linked back to the very first moments of ep 1. She was a maid doing her job who ended up being a loose end at the end. I'm guessing spending time with the Oinky Doink cafe got her attached, because I don't see any other reason why she'd risk her life revealing her past just to prevent Ranko from potentially end up in a messy situation.\n\nAnd speaking of Ranko, I loved seeing her in a way we haven't before, just her awkward self on a romantic date. Thought it did seem ill fated to work out, Ranko still deserves happiness. She does so much for the cafe and her coworks, she deserves to be happy.\n\nBe sure to stay for post-credits scene too.",

Poor Ocachimachi. \n\nPost credit scene hit like, well, a bullet to the heart. \n\nSo hoping this gets picked up for a second season. \n\nI've been watching, each week, the dub followed by the sub and the voice acting in each is amazing.",

Wasn't expecting real drama.\n\nI'm calling it, at least one Oinky Doink maid, and I'm leaning towards either Ranko or Nagomi, isn't making it to the end of the series.\n\nPanda has taken two people from Ranko already. That'll come to a head sometime soon.",

I'm not a great fan of the genre you *think* it is but it's compelling viewing. Some of the episodes are slightly hit or miss but, for me, it's anime of the season.",

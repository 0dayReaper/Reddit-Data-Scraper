I could've watched Fuyutsuki, Komori, and Otonashi girl talk, and Himuro, Saejima, and Katori game the whole ep. \n\nAnd def the last 5 minutes of the episode is the most magical, romantic, and hearthswarming feels I've had watching this show. Himuro's nerves making the most magical perfect frame of Fuyutsui, i mean [just look at this](https://i2.wp.com/animenosub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/The-Ice-Guy-and-His-Cool-Female-Colleague-Episode-10.jpg)! And Himuro giving her her birthday present! My god, squees and glees galore! I need like another season of this. Or two. I really want more!",

I mean there are still no cast announcements yet other than him and Zeno Robinson as Tai. So I wonder; When it will be released, Will the dub itself will be Union Proving he will come back or will he turn it down?\n\nEdit: [Tweet by the Man Himself](https://mobile.twitter.com/BenjaminDiskin/status/1638705236994048000) and it\u2019s nice to know he supports AJ.",

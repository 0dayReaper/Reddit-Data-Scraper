Heavy Metal, Dark Fantasy - He powers up from a kiss\n* Daimidaler - Comedy that I frankly found terrible, but the guy has to turn girls on to make the Mechas stronger\n* Engage Kiss - Kissing for power up, not quite getting turned on though, so probably not what you want\n* Freezing - Pretty solid Ecchi action show, seems like the girls get aroused when their partners activate their freezing area.\n* Highschool DxD - His power is derived from his desire to see breasts and become the Harem King.\n* Rosario + Vampire - Kiss activates girl's superpower\n* Super Hxeroes - Exactly what you want, kinda meh though\n* The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter - Exactly what you want, and a pretty fun show, basically a harem where the MC actually gets some action\n* The Saint's Magical Power is Omnipotent - Girl MC, so *probably* not what you want, and it's more love/romance than being turned on.\n* The Testament of New Sister Devil - Basically a hentai without penetration, has what you want\n* Ulysses: Jeanne d'Arc - Pretty lame show, but kisses power up the girls\n* Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid - Exactly what you want except it's all girls.\n* Vermeil in Gold - Girl sucks power from master.\n* Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches - Powers happen when they kiss",

The MC and his childhood friend sharing rather passionate kisses \"for the sake of restoring MP\" was amazing :\\].",

A simuldub, as in like a 2-4 week gap, is pretty unlikely considering the scale of the cast especially in Wano of all arcs. Even though a lot of people are hoping for that. And I\u2019m sure Toei/CR would want to keep the batch release on Microsoft first going given they probably make a decent return on that. I guess we\u2019ll see soon.",

There were 5 releases of Collections in 2021 but only 2 in 2022. It makes sense that the merger would slow it down because now they will have more anime that is being released from one company now. It really sucks though because I collect the DVDs. Just much nicer to rewatch on those as opposed to streaming and it is much easier to lend to people to get them into the series.",

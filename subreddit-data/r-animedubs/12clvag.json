There are episodes where the Crunchyroll dub does better (King Canute stuff) and Netflix does better (Farm stuff, especially Episode 9. Aleks and Kirk did excellent work there.).  I'd be down if there was a project that combines both dubs into one super dub.",

Focusing on just one aspect, it's almost like the script situation has reversed between the two dubs. Sentai's S1 dub had the issue of a lot more pauses mid sentence to try and match to flaps compared to Netflix's, and now it seems Netflix's script for S2 is the one that has more pausing compared to CR's.\n\nIf I had to guess, maybe Netflix's scriptwriters are more strapped for time than CR's, because they're effectively only one episode behind in release compared to the sub.",

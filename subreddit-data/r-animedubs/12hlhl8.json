They could be ficore, so it could be a sensitive subject based on whatever reason the actor may have chosen to not be a part of actual SAG. And even if they are a part of SAG, you then also ask everyone about being in Fire Emblem, which, unless I am mistaken, is a nonunion game. So you're kinda asking everyone to out themselves as working \"off card,\" which, again, unless I am mistaken, the union doesn't like.",

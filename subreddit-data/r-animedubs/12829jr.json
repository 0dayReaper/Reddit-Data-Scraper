            "comment": "This show was never very good, but it was fun at times. Not lately though. It seems pretty clear that it was meant to be a satire of the genre and of various anime tropes.\n\nYou know how Isekai protagonists usually collect harems, well what if the harem was a gorilla, the unluckiest adventurer, and a donkey. Wouldn't it be cool to be an adventurer? Well, these adventurers are all goofy freaks. You know how the hero is always late to the battle to give other characters a chance to shine? Well, this hero is has some nasty diarrhea.\n\nIn theory, these are solid subversions of those tropes, it didn't make me laugh out loud, but I see the humor. Feels like they really ran out of ideas in these last few episodes. They're really leaning on the over-the-top reactions to try and sell the bad jokes they shoehorned in.",

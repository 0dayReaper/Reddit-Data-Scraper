It\u2019s so frustrating. Especially when they have basically been bullying everyone to cancel their funi and migrate to CR \n\nReally wish I had ignored them \ud83d\ude44",

            "comment": "These next few episodes upcoming, including this one, are some of my all time favorites, and a main reason why this season of MHA just be an all-timer for me. (I know how attached I am to S4, but S6 not pulling any punches in the feels dept).\n\nMy heart breaks for Deku. I guess with the way heroes have been portrayed in media, they're expected to toughen in out, put on a brace face, and power through it. But when a hero is suffering as much as the rest of us, who will be there to support him? And jesus, Deku's depression state in this one. I mean, how many times IRL have you heard someone close to you say those three words, **\"I'm fine, really.\"**? Might as well hold up a giant ass sign that says \"help me\". But with the dangers that having OFA entails, it's justifyable why Deku would want to do this alone.\n\nBut this is why I love this series so much. They've done a great job in making us care for Deku, and his friends as well. ANd now it's their turn to help their friend out. And my heart just feels so much for them!\n\nI can not... CAN NOT wait for next week's ep. I have way too much to say, and I'll prep my feels for an additional time so I can find the words to describe how much this ep, and by extension, this show means to me.",

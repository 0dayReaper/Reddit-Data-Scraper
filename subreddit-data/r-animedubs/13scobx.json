Contracts can be very complicated and very limiting, and some contracts don\u2019t care since Crunchyroll and fubimation are technically one company now anyway, so I assume when the contract switches then I would assume they will start transferring the dubs over then.",

                    "comment": "The nature of the contracts with some shows on funimation is that several shows DID NOT transfer automatically because of the way the contracts were drawn up.  This has been an issue with about 5-10% of series on funimation - according to the things they have said.  In those cases, they have either tried to work things out with to allow the transfers, or... They are just waiting the agreements to end so they can move them over.  Lots of legal BS here.  The way anime is licensed is so much different than any other form of media and it's a bit ridiculous.  \n\n\nThen you have the issue of shows that end up in licensing hell and who even has the rights to certain shows... It's confusing.",

Getting used to one thing and not liking the alternative.\n\nFranky's Japanese VA, like most of the major cast in _One Piece,_ is a very famous legacy voice actor who's been doing voices since the 80s.  He voiced the original Dark Schneider, as a quick example.  In _One Piece,_ he originally voiced Bon Clay, but the staff evidently felt that a single side character was wasting the man's talents and pedigree.  It is a bit amusing when you play a One Piece game and it features both Bon Clay and Franky and it's obviously the same guy.",

I've made my case, though, and it'd be at least amusing for somebody to challenge me on any of those points.\n\nMost modern dubs try their best to match the original Japanese in everything: script accuracy without arbitrarily leaving anything out (to differentiate strikingly from modern game localizations); vocal range; personalities of the characters.  The best of them are very clearly directing their actors to recreate exactly what's being heard in the Japanese language track.  _One Piece_ does its fair share of this, but since the dub spans decades, including some of the earliest years when it was still considered cool to just straight up censor content, it also carries some legacy baggage from that devil-may-care era.  That's my best explanation for why the cast is a mixed bag.",

I guess it's because the English versions of those two are so different (and the ones I prefer.)\n\nIt is kind of interesting to hear the Japanese voice of a character first and then hear the English second. In that case, I definitely feel like prefer the Japanese most of the time. \n\nGuess that's just the bias we get from listening to one version first.",

(That's the reason I enjoy dubs nowadays: They've gotten damn good.)\n\nThat said, I _very strongly prefer it_ when a conscious effort is made by the dubbing studio to follow the Japanese lead.  Take Brook for example.  I probably don't need to gush over how good a job they did with that voice pick.  It's a solid case-in-point for what I said earlier about later voices being conspicuously better than earlier ones.\n\nSo it doesn't sit well with me when you also have a case like Franky, where the two voices could scarcely be more different.  Or Robin, where the original voice actress has certain mannerisms and casual aloofness and this is completely lost by the almost snarky tone of the English VA.  (The latter being a case of inadequate direction... still a bit of a problem with dubs, although there are discrete exceptions, such as _Re:Zero._)",

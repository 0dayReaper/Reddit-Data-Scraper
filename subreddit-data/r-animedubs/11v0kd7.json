            "comment": "Like 20 episodes in and Senpai finally gets a little clarity on how Nagatoro really feels. Preview makes it look like a romantic rival is coming, spurring the characters into action, classic anime rom-com stuff. I'm thinking she is the exhibitionist's sister. That should be fun.\n\nIn these shows, I often sympathize more with the rival characters. They usually serve as a foil to contrast a character's faults. In this case, that would be someone who at least doesn't tease senpai at all.\n\nInstead of awkwardly building romance over time, the new girl tends to be more direct. It makes sense as a strategy, if someone is moving in on your crush, you can't afford to wait around anymore. But, I also have to wonder if the rival's feelings are genuine or if she only wants him because someone else has him.",

We've reached an inflection point.  We are now at a point in time that the animes themselves are just as profitable as the source material.  (which is also why anime production is the greatest volume it's ever been.) - Thus, success/popularity of an anime can be just as predictive of more seasons arriving as the LNS and Mangas.  Quints is extremely popular, and thus it is getting a full run.  I've really only seen this happening over the past 2-3 years honestly.  And WAY more of recent... over the past year.  But it's definitely nice to see animes not being brought down by the source material being completed.",

I mean I still see them coming out too.  However, it seems to be more profitable to get a hit that can get multiple seasons.    \nSo the catch-22 of this is that animation studios may focus more on sequels and shows they believe can have longer runs.  VS more niche content.  And honestly, some of the best stuff I've seen could be considered \"niche.\" So it's a bit disappointing.  You might be less likely to see more risky bets.",

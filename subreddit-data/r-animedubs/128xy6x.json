Minor Replicant Spoilers: &gt;!Maybe I'm missing something, is there a reason they did this? I played Replicant in English and the wedding chant was the one from the Japanese episode so I don't get why they would go to the trouble of changing that, but then not go through the trouble of using \"This Cannot Continue\"!&lt;.\n\nI just finished episode 6 and other than my complaints above and the lack of subtitles for Japanese text, the dub is amazing.",

I'm still not ruling out the possibility that's she's liar liar pants on fire and there's something supernatural about her. Interested in seeing how the new girl in the other world will turn out. This might be unusual for isekai's in that there might be two distinct plots and casts per world.\n\nThe kids at the rich kids(?) school seem too... nice. I don't know if that's because Yuya is fit and hot now, and they'd have treated him like dirt when was Sir Chonksalot, or if they're just simply that nice. Of course, there's the third possibility that there's something very wrong with the school.\n\nAlso, that's Jahy as Yuya's sister, isn't it. Goddammit. Every time I hear that VA's voice it's instant Jahy flashbacks.\n\nThe ADR engineer's surname is fucking metal.",

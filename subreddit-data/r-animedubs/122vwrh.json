Looks like Gugu also Socrates'd himself after getting crippled in battle.\n\nHell, the only one to have happy deaths were Tonari, who died a hero and surrounded by followers, and Bon, who died a powerful man and surrounded by loved ones.\n\nI like how this show treats loss and tragedy. In other shows it feels cheap or simply there to give edgelord/shock value. In this show you actually feel a little sad every time someone goes.\n\nAt least the story continues. I assume a bunch of people are getting resurrected in the modern day. I think even the nameless boy even got his body back, if the eye color change is anything to go by.",

This season wasn't as hard on me through it's entirety as the last season was, but seeing March reunite with Fushi only to be taken away again probably had as much impact emotional as the entire 1st season. Can't wait for season 3 and the modern setting will definitely be interesting.",

I didn't know you could speak english!\" said the characters...in english...I GET that to some degree we have to suspend disbelief and accept they are speaking in Japanese but we are hearing it in english for our benefit...but...c'mon...that is ***THE*** laziest way to convey a scene.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---we get generic subtitles and not dubtitles. It kills my focus a bit when watching the DVD",

            "comment": "Agree completely on honorifics. It being part of an outlier nickname is fine (I.e. Kacchan in MHA), but beyond that at best it\u2019s an annoyance that detracts from an otherwise solid dub and at worst if it\u2019s prevalent enough I will almost always just switch over to the sub. It never sounds natural and I\u2019ve never seen a case where it\u2019s necessary to suggest a character\u2019s relationship to someone (sibling, close friend, etc\u2026) that either the story itself or good adaptive writing can\u2019t establish on its own.\n\nNot really adapting the use of different languages in a dub is sort of a case by case thing, and I\u2019m understanding of limitations there. It does annoy me a bit when it\u2019s clear the writers didn\u2019t even seem to try to work around an instance they easily could have, but I also know sometimes your hands are tied. I actually find the opposite issue more common, where characters who were dubbed into ENG have some quick throwaway line about how they\u2019re all \u201cspeaking JPN.\u201d While this isn\u2019t always the case, there\u2019s often a way to write around that particular discrepancy but too many times they don\u2019t seem to bother.",

Especially when the audio quality of one or two voice actors varies greatly from the rest.  Or the volume levels are not balanced.  It\u2019s just jarring to hear a poor quality voice that sounds like it was recorded through a cheap mic with no pop filter when generally all modern dubs at least have pretty great recording quality.",

I don\u2019t remember who, it\u2019s been a while) as the hottest girl he knows or something instead of the Japanese actress he actually said in the sub.\n\nBut I understand they did the best the best they could. Sure, it un-immersioned me, but I would\u2019ve been more confused trying to figure out who he was talking about if it had been the Japanese actress.\n\n(Edit: Thought I might\u2019ve remembered the name dropped)",

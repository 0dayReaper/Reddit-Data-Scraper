Usually modern anime only do 12 episodes. On the off chance that they want to do 24 they often split the show into two 12 ep long parts, and leave a season between them (like spy x family, Slime isekai and etc.). JJK will air all 24 eps in the span of 6 months.",

And I'm pretty sure they aren't exactly short on money either. Also, I read that texas is a free to work state, which apparently means that union or not, you are welcome.\n\nAlso, since I'm asking questions, why is texas so against unions? I don't know much about unions, but as I understand it, unions look out for workers rights, health, fair pay and etc. So why do texas VA's want to work without all of the above, and then get mad if some people want better for themselves?",

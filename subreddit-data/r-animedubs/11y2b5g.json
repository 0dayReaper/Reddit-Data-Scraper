Which is give or take, 4-5 episodes less than an year-round weekly release of subbed episodes. \nIt's quite a good output of episodes in that regard.  \nPersonally, I'm content with that amount on a year-to-year basis and on the consistent tri-yearly current release schedule.\n\nHowever, the ISSUE lies in the fact that the dub is so painfully and annoyingly lagging behind the sub. Not to mention, the gap between the dub and sub just keeps on widening with every release. VIZ needs to do something about it during the upcoming break between Part-I &amp; Part-II.",

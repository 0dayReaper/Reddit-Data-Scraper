I figured she would bring him to her world for medical treatment. The guns not working on the goblins is interesting. What will they do now. It is nice to see Mitsuha does care about others. I wonder if she will come clean to them about being from another world?",

            "comment": "I have a feeling next episode is going to escalate into Gate, but with the Messenger of Lightning + PMCs instead of the JSDF.\n\nImpressed with how fast Mitsuha noticed, processed, and reacted to the assassin. She also hit about 12 shots from a burst weapon into the assassin's torso from about 2 yards, while in an awkward sitting position, stressed, and injured. That's actually impressive.\n\nLiked the touched with modern medicine. Even bullet wounds (if they're not immediately a lights-out hit) nowadays are survivable if they get you to a surgeon quickly enough.\n\nI guess in her panic Mitsuha forgot she could just teleport the rocks out of the way, like how she teleported pieces of cliffside to carve her modern art statues.\n\nCurious about the goblins. One goblin ate a bullet. It didn't bounce of, since we saw a splash of blood, so it penetrated. The way it got up none the worse for wear was weird, though. We don't know if the captain's Mk18(?) or Mitsuha's M93R was what scored the hit. A 9mm can be shrugged off if we assume goblins are built tougher than a human. A 5.56x45 at that range will fuck you up though. If that was the case the goblin should've permanently laid down and regretted his life choices.\n\nThis, plus the fact that other goblins had literally zero reaction to the two humans (and if these are anything like Goblin Slayer goblins, it would've been rape boners activate for Mitsuha), makes me think they're either magically compelled and/or undead. The play would probably to smoke the human knight leading them, since he's probably the pied piper.",

(Aside from mizuha jumping worlds of course.)\n\nObviously that's a bit of a contradiction though, so who knows.",

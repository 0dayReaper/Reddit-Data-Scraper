            "comment": "As an American I'd like to hear other accents more frequently (and for them to use actual British people when doing, say, Moriarty the Patriot -- not that the accents were bad, just that they were noticeable to a trained ear).\n\nHowever, America and Canada combined have 2/3 of the world's native English speakers, and a fairly large chunk of the remainder speak accents that would be seen as out-of-place or difficult to comprehend in a general context (specifically Nigeria, which has the third most). Additionally, most English speakers are used to listening to General American English because of Hollywood's dominance on the global stage. Those combined means there's less supply *and* demand for non-American-sounding voice actors -- that exacerbates the problem because it means there's no real financial incentive to for anyone to try to grow those markets, meaning there's less incentive for people in those markets to become voice actors... it's a vicious cycle, to put it mildly.",

I don't know enough about the anime industry in India to see whether or not there's enough demand for it. There are certainly a lot of Indian English-speakers (2nd most of any country when counting both Native and L2), but they might prefer Hindi dubs for all I know. \n\nI would assume that, since they're releasing both, CR is checking to see which is more profitable and will drop the less of the two... unless they use the same voice actors for each, in which case it might be cheap enough to not matter...\n\nAnd *of course* I can't find the cast for either on the English-speaking web -- not surprising, but still annoying. But they did release two of the dubs as Hindi-only, so it must be expensive enough to matter and shows that English is the less important of the two (which is good -- much better to let people who have no ability to watch it in the first place do so than to give people another English option).\n\nRegardless, I hope it's successful -- India is definitely the country that makes the most sense since they have twice as many English speakers as the U.K. and Bollywood has been successful enough to carve out its own niche.",

Same with Turkish, Tagalog, Hasua, etc. \n\nThey just started making Arabic dubs last year, but I don't know how successful that will be since that tends to be spoken by very conservative countries and anime is... well, anime. \n\nAs far as dialects, most places that aren't the originating country are poorer than the originating country, save for the U.S., since that's how colonialism works. \n\nI'd say, with this last batch of expansions (India, Arabic, Italian... I might've missed one or two), CR has gotten everywhere that could possibly support a dubbing industry. Hopefully, as developing nations get stronger it'll become more diverse, but we'll see.",

The style of english they seem to learn in Japan seems to be more aligned toward British style english than American English.  (Just as it seems that Mexican Spanish is taught more in the US in schools than say... Spain Spanish.)  And as someone that has a few bilingual friends from japan.  The english they speak SOUNDS more british to me, if that makes sense.  (Of course, that second thought is more based on opinion.) - I do wonder if this has something to do with the amount of influence britain had in the east asian region for... A long time.  Pretty much up until WWII and even into the early 90's with Hong Kong.\n\nThat said... As others have pointed out.  The vast majority of english media in the world comes from the US.  Which pushes most of the acting, voice acting, etc.  To also come from the US.  And there's not a lot of financial incentive for other places to do it if there's not really a market for it.

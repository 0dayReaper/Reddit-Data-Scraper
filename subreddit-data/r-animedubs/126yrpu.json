Sometime I wanna watch something but the art style is off putting. \nI\u2019ve given some anime that I was a bit wary a chance and I\u2019m always presently surprised. Anyone got any anime that they recommend that they was surprised about?",

            "comment": "Anime is primarily a visual art form and should absolutely be judged by its art style. You don't judge a book by its cover because a book is not a visual art medium (graphic novels are obviously an exception), but if an anime doesn't *look* good, then of course you're going to be critical of it.\n\nI do think that is still worth giving shows a try even if you don't like the style though. If you're just looking at character model sheets and you think \"those look boring,\" it's still worth watching an episode or two to see how they move and how they're composited.\n\nStyle is also part of storytelling, and there are some shows that deliberately use a certain style to mislead the audience, like Madoka and Made in Abyss. So even if you think you won't like the show simply because the art style looks like it's a genre you don't like, you might be missing out.\n\nA lot of people miss out on great shows because something about the art style bothers them, which is unfortunate. I'm definitely guilty of it as well. I can't even watch Kaguya because Chika's hair just kills me. Any time I see a character with hair accessories on their bangs like that it's an immediate visual turn off for me. As someone with the same style of bangs, it's honestly *painful* to look at.",

The sole notable exception I have is ***Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun***, whose art style I absolutely adore.

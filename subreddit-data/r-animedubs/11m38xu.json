The flashback in the second half to Jun and Misuzu back in middle school was great too, as well as elaborating more on their anxiety when it came to Tomo. Seeing Misuzu's genuine smile and laughter was the highlight of the episode for me.\n\nI'm very happy to be watching this show each week and very grateful for the same-day simuldub too. It's been one of the most fun shows of the season for sure.",

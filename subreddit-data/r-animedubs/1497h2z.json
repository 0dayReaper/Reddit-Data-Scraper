Sentai couldn't even get Billy Kametz (who was in the Netflix dub) back for the season 3 dub even if they wanted to since he was already on a hiatus from voice acting just before his passing.\n\nWhen the season 3 dub was coming out weekly, it seems they were able to record a handful of episodes with Aaron before Bryson had to replace him. The reason for it was because Aaron was dealing with vocal issues back then. I have no idea why they chose not to bring Aaron back for those season 3 episodes or the movie. It was likely either because the voice director didn't feel the need to let him reprise his role or it was Aaron who chose to turn down the role himself.",

People who bought the bluray already confirmed that they did not bring Aaron back, rather dubbed the whole season 3 with a new VA. The movie also has the new VA. I wish I was wrong but sadly that's the truth",

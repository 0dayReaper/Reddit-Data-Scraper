            "comment": "This really isn't my kind of show, but I gave it a shot because I've enjoyed Narita's other works and I wanted to hear Morgan Berry in a role like this. She really nailed it. Her voice suited the character and she balanced the edginess and minor pretension without being over the top. She's swiftly becoming one of my favorite voice actors honestly, but I've yet to see her in a show that I really love.\n\nBree Han however...honestly sounded like an abridged actor. A good one, but still notably different from the rest of the cast. Honestly, it was kind of jarring. I don't think that the voice suited the character very well either, so I went and watched the trailer to see if they were mimicking her JP voice but no, her Japanese VA has a voice that matches what I was expecting. I generally don't think it's a bad thing to go in a different direction, but I don't think this was the best choice.\n\nI love seeing new voice actors and I think it's great that they hired a rookie for (what I assume is) a lead role, but I can't help but think there were better options, or maybe she just needed more focused directing. It will be interesting to watch her grow though.\n\nAs for the show itself, it was about what I expected. I'll give it another episode or two but so far it's just not my thing.",

                            "comment": "That's actually a great idea and it would work if the show was actually trying to hide her yandere-like tendencies, but the character design is pretty edgy and she has like one line of slightly normal dialogue before going off the rails, so I don't buy it. That sort of thing would work for Yuno Gasai who genuinely looks sweet and innocent, but not for a girl who looks like she just walked off the set of Danganronpa.\n\nI also think her voice is too low to actually sound innocent anyway, so if that's really the direction they went with, it just didn't land for me. I do like this character archetype though, so it's going to be interesting to hear how the actress develops over the course of the show.",

The opening fight scene was really well done, and they did magic without the tropey \"I will call my super ultimate attack name!\" Even without announcing their attacks, you understood what the magic sigils were for. Great example of showing, not telling.\n\nAnd now the story seems to be reverse Overlord. Ainz was a normal dude and he gets isekai'd to become the evil villain in a fantasy world. In this show the corpse god is reverse-isekai'd as a normal dude in a mundane world, albeit still with some powers.",

It just doesn\u2019t sound like I pictured it in my head when reading the source manga.\n\nFor anime onlies they did a good job of attempting to throw doubt on who was reincarnated.\n\nStick around for the post credits scene!\n\nA promising start, can\u2019t wait for more!\n\nAlso If you want more stories with Shagura, he gets his own short story series within each Manga Volume.",

The fact that she has a different kind of sound to her compared to everyone else makes her unique in a good way, in my eyes. It's why I like hearing new actors. I felt the exact same way about Tabitha Ray's Hotaru Shidare from Dagashi Kashi.\n\nI'll check it out later and give my opinion.",

Doesn\u2019t take away from my enjoyment of watching.",

But I gotta say, with the quiet way Polka talks, I would have not known that was Morgan Berry.",

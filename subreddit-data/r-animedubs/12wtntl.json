Almost felt like the first episode of a new seasonal: \"My Friend Tried to Kill me, but an Ice Princess Rescued me and Now we live together.\"\n\nI'm guessing this is gonna kick off a longer mystery arc with this season, hoepfully doesn't overstay its welcome, but hope it generates loads of intrigue.",

She's actually a likeable character.\n\nI'm surprised they actually arrested the dude simply on Masayuki's accusation. I guess he wigged out and started blabbering a confession when he thought he saw a ghost.\n\nBeing Masayuki is suffering apparently. Dude's life was one long conga line of betrayal.",

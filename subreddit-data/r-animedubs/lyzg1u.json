A majority of the profit for the series comes from the sale of the Index Light Novels. And from what I've seen in the Japanese community, they were recently starting to feel that the franchise's manga series were starting to be too high in number. Now Railgun is only one of the 4 spin offs still getting new chapters and volumes, with the other 3 ending, going on hiatus, or being cancelled last year.",

It honestly felt like they took two different seasons and tried to cram into one season so it felt like there were way too many different storylines going on all over the place. Maybe they were just trying to knock out the remaining story in order to move onto the New Testament side of things but I really expected a lot more considering how people had to wait 8 years for it.",

I love this anime so much and watch it once a year because it's my \"gateway\" anime.\n\nI was never excited about high fantasy/high school aesthetic and thought I'd watch the series because the main character worked at McRonald's(McDonald's) which I thought was interesting and funny. I loved it. The series won me over when Mao debates using magic to fix the deep fryer despite having little magic. From then on I started giving other anime a fair shot: Overlord, Relife, etc.\n\nGreat news! I can't wait to watch it! I always held out hope but every passing year lost a little. YEAH!",

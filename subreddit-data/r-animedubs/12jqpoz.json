While his classmates are gifted with impressive abilities useful in combat, Hajime is belittled for only gaining an inferior transmutation skill that lacks any real offensive power.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;During an expedition in the Great Orcus Labyrinth, Hajime is betrayed by one of his classmates, plummeting him to the bottom of an abyss. Though he survives the fall, Hajime is faced with menacing monsters and misfortunes that send him spiraling into a grim nightmare. Desperate to live and return home one day, he resolves to fight for his survival\u2014only to meet an imprisoned vampire he names Yue, who is also seeking to escape the labyrinth. Taking an interest in him, Yue and a few others along the way accompany Hajime on his journey to find a way back home, while steadily transforming from commonplace to the world's strongest. \n\n[Previous Anime Dub Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/search/?q=author%3AAutoModerator%20AND%20title%3AAnime%20Dub%20Discussion%20-&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sr_nsfw=)",

Sure there were flaws, but it was just fun to watch. Personally, I enjoy an MC that isn\u2019t afraid to tell it like it is and doesn\u2019t lament about every little thing.",

It\u2019s a great one where, though people don\u2019t enjoy harem themes all the time, he isn\u2019t working to get one. They literally just follow him around. Animation style isn\u2019t too bad. Storyline is decent. And I appreciate how the story starts with \u201ccool we are in a new world, it\u2019s like a movie\u201d to \u201cf everything I just want to go home\u201d and he works to do that while reluctantly helping along the way",

They just kinda follow him around. \n\nYeah he's kind of a selfish character that somehow ends up in situations to help, so he does.  I can respect that.  There's a lot of Isekais MC's that just have everything fall into their laps.  Or are like goody goody selfless 100% of the time.  Hajime is most certainly not.",

Certainly elevates the show and makes it more interesting.

Hajime will be like.  You figure it out yourself. Bye.  Unless it helps himself.\n\nNot exactly redeeming.  Certainly interesting though.",

But that first season was a guilty pleasure anime of mine.  I watched it without knowing about the bad reviews.  Loved it. And was confused about all the hate.  Went back and watched it again before season 2... And loved it... Again.  Maybe I have bad taste in anime sometimes. But. I really enjoyed that first season a lot.  Good \"turn your mind off\" Isekai. MC is a badass that isn't afraid to let you know.  Second season I felt was weaker (despite the better pacing art and CG) but... Maybe that's my opinion. Still thought it was good.  Great mindless Isekai Harem. (Despite the MC only really wanting one of the girls.)",

Sure he gains some serious strength once he creates his artificial equipment but his ability to create guns, rocket launchers, satellite weapons, humvees, and one big dragon piercing (in a couple ways) piledriver is what makes him the toughest MFer in this world.  Couple that with his allies being the tough as nails ladies they are and you have a team that is pretty tough to beat.",

I get him saying screw the rest of his class for betraying him but for him to brush off the teacher, who was the only one looking out for their interests and saying \u201cHey Guys let\u2019s not do the adventuring thing\u201d, gave me pause. I know he warmed up to her later but that initial meeting kinda turned me off to him.\n\nAlso there was some stuff with Yue that rubbed me the wrong way but that was a clip from Season 2 I may have taken out of context.\n\nAll in all this series just wasn\u2019t my jam.",

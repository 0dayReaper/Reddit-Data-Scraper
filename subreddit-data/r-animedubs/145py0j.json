The dead leader, which was the whole impetus behind their attack, isn't actually a dead leader. Her mouth was moving when they showed her, hands clasped, on the bed.\n\nThe rest of the episode was huge. It's all but explitictly stated that the dying girl and the white haired doctor are Mimihime and the guy who likes her from paradise. That's corroborated that Usami claims to not be a doctor, yet made functional prosthetics in a post apocalyptic world. In the institution the white haired kid was shown to be a tech wiz/engineer. It wouldn't be a stretch for him to also make life support equipment for Hoshio/Mimihime.\n\nWhich would imply that the institute scenes and the main story are not happening concurrently, but rather the scenes from the institute are all basically flashbacks.\n\nThis would also resolve another question, namely the relationship between Maru and Tokio. Since we know Tokio is a girl and banged the artsy kid, it would be Maru isn't some mysterious clone of Tokio, but her goddamned kid.\n\nThis could also mean the Maneaters the artsy kid was drawing are the mutated kids from the facility.",

    "postText": "dont get me wrong the Voice Actors themselves are not bad, in fact the VAs for the characters are great in other animes but in Tekken they're kinda bad? it's like they're force to mumble by the directors, the pauses after each sentence is also awkward. Paul Phoenix is the worst offender for this (Jamieson Price is a great VA) is it the Netflix Directors fault?",

I highly doubt it will get a season 2 or spin off.",

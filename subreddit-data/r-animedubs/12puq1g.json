I feel like you get a really good idea of what they\u2019re like even if they don\u2019t have a lot of scenes. \n\nGardar\u2019s introduction was certainly unexpected. I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d introduce a new plot line like this right now, but it makes sense to give Einar more personal conflict. Some of my favorite types of stories are ones that can neatly intertwine multiple plot lines. I was unsure at the beginning because of how different it was, but I might end up liking this season more than the first.",

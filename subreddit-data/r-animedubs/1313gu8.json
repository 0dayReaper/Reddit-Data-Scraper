            "comment": "God im feeling so many feels with this episode. I know technology and modernization has allowed us to take many things in life for granted. So even something as simple as baking bread from scratch can be so uplifting. Or even cameras. We have it so lucky that everything is digital now that sometimes its easy to forget how interesting and complex the very first one was. (Also got feels when Minami got hers).\n\nI love this show. Just two eps in, and I love it.",

The music is perfect and knows just how to emphasize every moment. This season is already shaping out to be the best.\n\nAlso, was that just a Japanese joke shirt thing, or was Minami actually into American football?",

They Didn't return to direct this Season but instead, they were both given an even bigger opportunity of Voicing 2 Brand New Characters in the Show, together as Ryusei and Francois. :)",

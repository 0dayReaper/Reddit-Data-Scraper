So fucking proud of my boy.!&lt;\n\nI also can't wait for the background shenanigans between the two pairs of wingwomen, the contrast between how serious and formal the art club sisters (cousins?) are and how goofy and chaotic Gamo and Yoshi are is too good lmao.",

Due to localization, they actually call her \"Hayase\" here. \n\nSo in the dub, they changed it so that it's more like he's too shy to call her by her first name, which checks out because of the whole first-name-being-personal custom in Japan. So the reason this scene works really well imo is because he had the balls to call her Hayase for real for the first time.",

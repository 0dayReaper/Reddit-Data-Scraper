As they got older, Glass started getting more older woman roles and started sounding more and more like Clinkenbeard, who already had a mature sounding voice.",

            "comment": "Ah k. Yeah I see what you mean. I think the reason why it never popped into my head though is cuz most of the time when Colleen uses that voice it's either for a major character that you know she voices (Luffy, Gohan, Akito) or a minor character that doesn't really register in my memory (Asuramaru and kid versions of characters in flashbacks). Also cuz the example you bring up, Laura wasn't really known until a couple years after Seraph. \n\nBut yeah there are quite a few VAs that do have some overlapping sounding voices. Though you can normally tell them apart due to subtle differences.",

The earliest it could air is December 12 and then Funi streaming it the next day. But in this pandemic, I doubt it would be that soon.",

So it\u2019s believed Funi and Adult Swim signed a contract that Toonami would get debut dub rights for the rest of the series. This can be seen in how seasons 2 and 3, even though most of Funi\u2019s dubs were only a couple weeks behind the sub, were debuted on Toonami like 4-5 weeks after the simulcast, and Funi always promptly streams the dub on their streaming service the day after Toonami.\n\nFor other shows that Funi owns and Toonami is interested in, such as perhaps Assassination Classroom, it\u2019s believed Adult Swim does pay a license fee and contract to Funi and possibly the Japanese rights holders. As for how much that is, we probably will never know.",

AOT is pretty popular in the U.S., so they would be more likely to have a dub out a bit sooner, but due to the coronoavirus, it will be delayed. Last year, Fire Force &amp; Shield Hero dubs came out the same time as the sub, it could've been the case with AOT S4 if everything was normal. But, you're probably right that it could release at that time. I don't really know how Funimation dubbing process actually works. The reason why I think the dub will release during that time is all due to popularity of AOT.",

Season 3 Ep 1 aired in July 2018 &amp; the dub came in August 2018 about a month later. For Season 2 Ep 1 came in April 1, 2017 and the dub on Toonami came around the end of that month April 22, 2017. I won't count Season 1 because a while ago, that's what the time when new anime took a year or so to receive a dub. It could've been January 2021 if they were dubbing from the studio instead of home (Only 4-5 episodes behind like I figured it wouldve been).",

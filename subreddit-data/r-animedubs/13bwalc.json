            "comment": "And...The Eminence in Shadow makes his exit...for now.\n\nThat intense battle between Shadow vs Iris and Beatrix was really spectacular, that it's definitely a contender for fight of the year. I like that his crowbar skills as Cid from episode 1 returns for the finale, that was pretty cool. In the end, Shadow couldn't just be overpowered even as Iris borrows power. She really is a hothead, whining like a sore loser plotting vengeance while Beatrix keeps her cool even in defeat. With The Eminence now more known to the world, things are going to get even more suspenseful. The Bushin Festival is perhaps my favorite arc in this season.\n\nWhat's more interesting is that, as I called it, Rose finally gets recruited into Shadow Garden and I can't wait to see how she's going to develop and grow as a new person. Really looking forward to know more of Shadow Garden's numbers introduced in the finale as well, especially &gt;!Lambda!&lt;.\n\nShadow playing the piano at the end is such a nice finishing touch to the season, and he certainly has more in store with his role-playing. I'm also hyped to see more badassery from the Seven Shades (Epsilon best girl!) in Season 2. Also hoping Eta and Zeta get more screentime. Pretty sure the future arcs yet to be animated are certainly going to be awesome.\n\nThis was one of my top shows from last year, and I'm glad it got dubbed so I could rewatch it. Cast was enjoyable overall, Adam Gibbs once again with another incredible role, in fact, Cid/Shadow's Japanese VA even [gave him a shoutout](https://twitter.com/Shadowgarden_PR/status/1653708478362583040). Christina Kelly was so amazing as Alpha, and it's now one of my favorite roles from her. But one voice I have to note here is **Ellen Evans** as Epsilon, she was pretty good too. I believe this is her first notable role, which means she is a rising star in Sentai's talent pool and I hope she gets cast more in the future. Season 2 can't come soon enough.\n\nThat's another dub from Sentai wrapped up, so I expect the premiere and cast of the Farming Life in Another World dub to be announced this week or the next. And hold your horses for the Oshi no Ko dub, I wouldn't expect the dub until the beginning or midway through the summer season, since Sentai these days likely prefers to wait for the sub run of a show to finish before dubbing it, but it may be possible they're already starting to work on it.",

I just didn't find myself really caring enough about anything, which I suppose was because of the MC being OP (they established that he trained in martial arts and whatnot in his past life, but it still made things boring). I also didn't find myself laughing nearly as hard as I feel like I was supposed to during the second half. I just stuck around for the waifus I guess.\n\nThe ending took a pretty surprising and interesting turn with Rose though, I'll give it that.",

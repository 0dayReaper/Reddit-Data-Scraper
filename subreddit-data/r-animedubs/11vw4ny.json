I guess we\u2019ll wait and see but thank you for that insight. \n\nThe post could\u2019ve easily just been a heat-of-the-moment type thing. We all got to eat and while it\u2019s great to support a friend and colleague, she probably understood that looking out for #1 in such a competitive field needs to come first. \n\nCR is a pretty huge company with a lot of professionals. I doubt they\u2019d let a small slight like that interfere with business. The Konosuba dub is incredibly popular and recasting Aqua could be a gamble. \n\nI really hope she sticks around. Not only is her voice perfect for Aqua but she seems like a really good person too.",

That's just my take though.",

            "comment": "While everyone here has been rightfully concerned about the possibility of cast members not returning or Bang Zoom not being used (though I feel like the odds are much more stacked for Bang Zoom and the cast to return), one of the bigger issues IMO is if the dub director/writer for all of Konosuba till now, Alex von David, wont be able to return and frankly I don't think the dub would be as loved as it has been without him.\n\nAlex has been pretty vocal about his preference for adapting the scripts of the dubs he's directing as well as his dislike of simuldub schedules and how those aspects don't mix (thanks to the tiring work he put into the Durarara x2 dub, and that was with some help from Caitlin Glass for a portion of episodes too)\n\nI think there's 3 distinct possibilities that are gonna happen for this spinoff and/or S3: \n\n* Alex doesn't end up directing the dub (like with Magia Record S1, though he at least wound up returning for S2)\n\n* Alex does direct but he gives up script duties to someone else (which is just super unlikely)\n\n* Crunchyroll agrees to hold off the dub release (either so a large portion of episodes have aired or till the show has completely finished airing) and Alex gets to both write and direct the dub with a sizeable buffer to work with. While letting the show finish airing without the dub beginning may be too much of a longshot, the latter option may be possible since Alex worked on SAO: Alicization while it was airing on Japanese TV (first dub ep of Alicization aired on Toonami Feb 10, 2019 which was when ep 18 of the sub aired in Japan)",

Disney has a total of 1 show as a frame of reference in terms of OG returning casts with there other original series dubs being piles of shit looking at you Summertime Rendering so who knows what would have happened there if they got it, and then Netflix where shows go to die and who's record on returning casts is spotty as hell...\n\nWeather people like it or not Crunchy is the best option if you want stuff dubbed and for it to maintain the same cast.",

Why is everyone worrying again so much that Texas might dubbed this, Bang Zoom always had the right to the dub. I mean you saw Bang Zoom still does remote recording for actors who live in Texas before right.\n\nI mean what happened to Mob Psycho was hopefully a one time Thing because Crunchyroll wanted to be Stupid and selfish and hopefully that incident will NEVER happen Again! \n\nespecially on Konosuba, It\u2019s way too popular to have a Texas Recast Overhaul.

Go too far, die in agony. Slap a bitch, die in agony. God forbid you forget her birthday or your anniversary, that might be die in agony, too.",

At least *she* agrees the marriage should be annulled and does not herself seem to like the whole \"if we ever argue, you'll get a brain hemorrhage\" thing. Still a time bomb, since it does not allow for a normal healthy relationship, but not toxic (at least not her specifically) XD",

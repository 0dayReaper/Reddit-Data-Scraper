And then they saved Goblin Crown (volume 5) for this. A one cour with rest of volume 4, volume 3, and volume 5 would've been perfect!\n\nGiven how the series has jumped around. As a light novel reader, legit curious what volumes will be adapted next season. Maybe they'll try volumes 6, 7, and 8, and give each like 4 episodes (assuming it's just one cour)? I guess also they could go back to volume 3 and have a disclaimer of sorts that this event takes place between season 1 and the OVA.\n\nEither way. I am excited!\n\nEdit: Actually another idea. Have this season cover rest of volume 4, volume 3, and Year One volume 1. Volume 3 ends in a way that could totally segue into a flashback!",

    "postText": "Is it just me or is Dale's grandmother in the anime \"If It's for My Daughter, I'd Even Defeat a Demon Lord\", Wendelgard, voiced by girl\\_dm_?\n\nShe doesn't really have too many lines in the show but the voice sounds extremely like girl dm's old granny voice. All I know about girl dm is a few short clips but her old granny voice sounds very close to the voice of the grandmother.\n\nI might be completely imagining it and I couldn't find who the VA of the granny is so... I'm asking here. Thanks in advance.\n\nEdit: as a comparison, look at the 8th episode at around 14:40 and [This clip.](https://youtu.be/sbKTGEc9yYc)",

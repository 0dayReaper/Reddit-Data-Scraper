That goes for all the background soldiers not specific scenes mind you... so i guess audio mixing in general?  \n\n\nListening to people vast majority of them unfortunately dont care about how pale it sounds in comparison and are looking only for the cast rather then focusing on actual audio quality but even if youre casual watcher there is quite literally no reason for you to pick netflix version over sentai cuz no matter what youre gonna notice very obvious missing flaps and censorship. Its not like sentai dub cast is lacking and they are doing amazing job but thats just my subjective take rather then objective fact about the show.",

It\u2019s more so just different translation methods. Words like \u2018fuck\u2019 don\u2019t really exist in Japanese so when it\u2019s included it tends to be at the better judgment of the localizer. Sentai is just more liberal with it than other translations. Like the line \u2018You dimwitted fucking Danes are all lower than pigshit,\u2019 in the CR subs it\u2019s translated as, \u2018You worthless Danes, You\u2019re worse than pigs.\u2019 It\u2019s similar to how in Chainsaw Man, the line \u2018\u2026I\u2019m like a perpetual motion machine!\u2019 got translated to \u2018I could do this for-*fucking*-ever!\u2019 You wouldn\u2019t really call the subs/manga translation of Chainsaw Man censorship, it\u2019s just like I said before with the difference in translation. All that said, I do think it\u2019s a point in favor to Sentai\u2019s dub, it fits the tone of the show and amplifies certain emotions in scenes like the Askeladd \u2018worthless Danes\u2019 one. Even though they stumble the ball in other places script-wise, I think it\u2019s a good aspect of their dub. I do wish VSI\u2019s script writer leaned more into that like Sentai. VSI\u2019s dub can feel a little too literal at points by comparison.\n\nIn terms of the audio mixing with the grunts, again I get what you\u2019re saying but personally I feel what hinders the Sentai dub is the actual performances of the grunt work almost feeling comical. Like in the clip of Askeladd fighting the soldiers, it feels like a lot of people doing reaction sounds even though people are coming at him one at a time for the most part. Also it\u2019s hard for me to give the point of audio mixing to Sentai when the audio quality of their mics is just so much more poorer to me than other studios. I feel like I can always hear some ambient noises from their recording space and makes it hard for me to get through. \n\nAll in all, it feels like the VSI dub was a more literal recreation of the JP track and all the choices made in that dub were meant to mirror the JP track while the Sentai dub had a little more of their twang on it, which isn\u2019t necessarily bad and I prefer some of them but some choices work better than others to me.",

Both manga translation as well as crunchyroll subs are having those (perhaps not literally all of them) swears in so whenever im comparing them to whatever netflix released its just sounds... kind of unbelievable really. I mean not a single fuck nor bitch or anything of the sort is there. Obviously all four of them (manga sentai netflix and cr subs) have different unrelated sets of people working on the show translating it but when only netflix decides to cut those swears out i cant help but say its censorship. Not a single one is there from season one quite literally its just \"damn it\" and the similar. The odds of that being an actual \"ah lets just go with that\" vibe rather then actually making contious decision on mooshing down the show are non existant tbh consider the fact that season one is simply filled with swearing so i disagree on netflix being closer to original on that part.  \n\n\nMic quality wise i had no issues with either but perhaps thats just me not having good enough tools to pick it up. My issue was mainly focused towards the lack of grunts that are well thought out in netflix dub. It kinda felt like \"okay askeladd is moving so we grunt\" rather then actually paying attention to his mouth is the swing big or small is he blocking and how many times. Very noticible in the last few sec of that clip.   \n\n\nWe have big pulling out sword swing (1) then kick (2) \\*block block\\* big swing again (3). Netflix just decides to leave whole thing filled only with background noise then do one big swing when askeladd is blocking and missed the last swing that kills enemy as well so its just the soldier grunting there. There are plenty other examples where the grunts are simply not present at all though but yeah you get the picture.",

Both manga translation as well as crunchyroll subs are having those (perhaps not literally all of them) swears in so whenever im comparing them to whatever netflix released its just sounds... kind of unbelievable really. I mean not a single fuck nor bitch or anything of the sort is there. Obviously all four of them (manga sentai netflix and cr subs) have different unrelated sets of people working on the show translating it but when only netflix decides to cut those swears out i cant help but say its censorship. Not a single one is there from season one quite literally its just \"damn it\" and the similar. The odds of that being an actual \"ah lets just go with that\" vibe rather then actually making contious decision on mooshing down the show are non existant tbh consider the fact that season one is simply filled with swearing so i disagree on netflix being closer to original on that part.\n\nI would agree with you if the VSI dub was devoid of cursing entirely or at least some visual censorship but it just doesn\u2019t make sense for it to be intentional censoring. For what reason would they have in doing so? Netflix has much worse and has *produced* much worse on their platform, anime or not. My guess is that it just seems like whoever was the scriptwriter strayed closer to a literal translation of the spoken Japanese script and didn\u2019t really think of going further because anime scripts in dubs generally never go that far and didn\u2019t see any reason to *spice* up the script like the Sentai scriptwriter. VSI\u2019s dub is translated how anime is typically translated. Though like I said I agree that this is one of the things I like better about Sentai\u2019s dub, though I don\u2019t agree with the censorship framing.\n\nAlso are these swears prevalent in the official manga translation? I wouldn\u2019t know. Or are you referencing fan translations because this seems very similar to how people were disappointed the BlueLock sub/dub didn\u2019t translate Isagi\u2019s line to \u2018You *retard*. Also do CR subs use \u2018fuck\u2019 in their sub translations in Season 1? I can imagine \u2018shit\u2019 but I don\u2019t remember \u2018fuck.\u2019 Either way, like I said, to me this is all just different translations methods and preferring certain aspects of each one. Like the idea with the CSM line. All translations are just the how the translator best thought to represent the original line in Japanese. There\u2019s a common saying in translation theory, \u2018You give 10 different translators the same line to translate, you\u2019ll get 10 different translations.\u2019 It\u2019s why every translation is slightly different even within the same series and scene, looking at you One Piece.\n\n&gt; Mic quality wise i had no issues with either but perhaps thats just me not having good enough tools to pick it up. My issue was mainly focused towards the lack of grunts that are well thought out in netflix dub. It kinda felt like \"okay askeladd is moving so we grunt\" rather then actually paying attention to his mouth is the swing big or small is he blocking and how many times. Very noticible in the last few sec of that clip.\n\nThis is where I was saying Netflix\u2019s dub seems to be more so recreating what the JP track did. VSI added grunts only when the JP track had it whereas Sentai added in efforts that weren\u2019t there before. In that exact scene you\u2019re talking about neither Naoya Uchida (aside from one grunt at the beginning but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s Askeladd) nor Kirk Thornton are doing efforts in that scene whereas Sentai had David do efforts for the whole scene.  I don\u2019t think either dub in this case is worse than the other, I guess you could maybe say something about Askeladd\u2019s intended portrayal about how he\u2019s not really exerting himself cutting through these soldiers but I don\u2019t know. But mic quality has always been a problem with Sentai dubs, kinda surprised you haven\u2019t noticed. It might be the way they treat their booths or their microphones aren\u2019t on the same level as the rest of industry. I know their rates are lower than the rest of the industry maybe that reflects on their equipment as well perhaps.",

I promise you that you can simply rewatch the show with cr subs or sentai dub and each time youre gonna hear a hard swear it wont be there in netflix dub.\n\nOk first off, Are you sure you\u2019re using CR\u2019s subs? Because they are not from Crunchyroll\u2019s subtitles for me. The line \u2018I\u2019m the one who\u2019s supposed to *fucking* kill you\u2019 is translated as \u2018I\u2019m the one who\u2019s supposed to *defeat* you\u2019 on CR. And nextly, I\u2019m asking for official translations because fan translations tend to be extra edgier than their counterparts. That\u2019s why I brought up the BlueLock retard/donkey translation. What I\u2019m saying is that I think the translator of the Netflix dub just wrote the script like any other script. If you haven\u2019t noticed not a lot of anime typically use that harsh of language. I don\u2019t even think the official translations of Berserk go that harsh generally. Because again, \u2018fuck\u2019 doesn\u2019t exist in Japanese. When it\u2019s included in  a translation, it\u2019s because the translator themselves wanted to include it in that specific translation for one reason or another. Like I said, it just seems like the VSI dub scriptwriter translated the script like any other anime in an official capacity without seeing a need to include harsher language in their dub. I already agree that it works for this show and gives Sentai\u2019s script some brownie points.i think my previous explanation follows through decently well as opposed to Netflix intentionally censoring Vinland for some reason neither of us can reconcile but still kept in swearing and visual violence. It just doesn\u2019t add up. \n\n&gt; That is just my personal take but i dont think we should ever go in to this line of logic. Jp dub is doing no different work then eng so we ought to treat them individually rather then limit ourself to their lack of knowledge how something is suppose to sound.

But if you like the Sentai dub\u2019s audio choices better than the Netflix and JP tracks, that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t think most people in VS community would have a problem with the JP/Netflix audio direction since this is the first time I\u2019ve seen someone have a problem with the audio choices or agree that it makes the \u2018product garbage or dog-water\u2019 but that\u2019s your disagreement to have. I was just addressing why the EN dub audio direction was the way it was, it didn\u2019t come from nowhere. I might\u2019ve preferred the Sentai\u2019s dub choice if that acting of the grunting was better. I\u2019m not saying every JP track decisions are perfect and make no mistakes, I\u2019ve definitely prefer some EN dub audio direction choices in other places, like I really liked an audio choice the One Piece dub made with one of its characters. But there are also instances I haven\u2019t liked dub specific audio choices like the original End of Evangelion adding in cartoony sound effects that ruin that series\u2019 design. Some choices work better than others and not everyone is going to like those choices, that\u2019s how art works.",

I cant confirm where the SS is from since it was sent to me long time ago so all i had to do is google search it. The clips are from yt although cut in parts so again i cant really give you an honest answer. I think were we differ is precisely at this point but checking every clip &amp; manga ss just for the sake of this convo is a bit too much work for me. For all i know the anime part might be fansubbed while manga being official but if you care enough to roughly browse through the episodes on cr to see if the fucks bitches etc are in then hey be my guest. Its just a lot of work to find the episodes and precise time stamp.\n\n&gt;I don\u2019t think the JP sound designer and the director has any \u2018lack of knowledge\u2019 or \u2018don\u2019t care\u2019 for how a scene should sound, it\u2019s just how they best wanted to direct it. But if you like the Sentai dub\u2019s audio choices better than the Netflix and JP tracks, that\u2019s fine.\n\nWell you see where i have issue is that there are certain parts in shows where you can tell something is dubbed incorrectly. Its not even vinalnd im referring to but like.. you cant just tell me that [here](https://streamable.com/6pkqg1) its suppose to be some artistic choice. No. The two characters are screaming their super powerfull attack and thats that. Clearly both of them have mouth open there is no room for debate here thats just what scene is presenting... and they just didnt bother dubbing the \"smash\" part for one of them... for whatever reason. [Another example](https://streamable.com/6mxltd) being jjk dub. Clearly this is suppose to be some kind of ad break after opening or whatever and they didnt bother to change the script addordingly in order to match flaps. Again quite clearly no room for discussion here they just didnt do their job. Its an error or oversight like any other.\n\nThose are the kind of stuff that i was talking about and frankly missed flaps or missmatched grunts are exact same issues. I dont care how jp dub does because frankly jp dubs are making those type of mistakes on the regular... again literally not dubbing the final scream of the movie i cant streatch it enough but this is just unacceptable really. And so i dont think we should emulate clearly inferior product. Im not saying you cant take inspiration or see how they did stuff but to bound yourself and not doing your job \"just because they did it in jp\" is the type of thinking im opposed to.",

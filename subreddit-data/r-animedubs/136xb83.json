    "postText": "So I just recently learned that Higurashi, School Live!, High School of The Dead and Vampire Hunter D are all gone form HIDIVE.  \n\nThose 4 were the pillar of why every October I tell people HIDIVE is the best App to subscribe too for Spooky Scary Halloween Anime, and then mention some of the more obscure relevant Anime they have to spice it up.\n\nLast I recall there being a big fuss over a bunch of shows disappearing form HIDIVE randomly without warning, but few of what I subbed to HIDIVE was effected.  Then the word was at some point in 2023 all of those would, be restored.\n\nBut now here we are in May of 2023 and instead more stuff is gone.",

Boy oh boy am I glad I bought the blu rays of Higurashi that were on Hidive.  I was worried they would do that, and there would be no where else to watch.  \n\nIn fairness. Their strategy works.  It's the same reason I grabbed Gate and Squid Girl.  As well as Ef.  \n\nNow... If they would only re-release the blu ray for Another.  Which, it's basically impossible to legally watch the dubbed version anywhere currently. Unless you want to pay over 100$ for the blu ray on the secondary market.",

Anime can go into a virtual black hole. Shows that were popular 10 to 5 years ago. Can be virtually impossible to find now. \n\nI remember 20 years ago paying $200 for a complete DVD set. Overall the cost of buying anime has gone down. \n\nYou could save up to buy it. If you put 25 bucks a month aside. You would have the money to get it 8 months. \n\nNewer fans completely relying on streaming to get their anime. Are in for an Awakening when licensing starts to expire. I do subscribe to several anime streaming sites. But I know that anything that I watch on there could go away at any time. \n\nIf there's something I'm really interested in that I know I'm going to rewatch. I buy it. \n\nThat's why I get annoyed with newer fans. Who constantly complain that their favorite show has left the streaming site. They absolutely refuse to buy anything physically. And then bitch they can't watch it.\n\nIf there's something that you truly enjoy. That you're going to repeatedly watch. It's best to buy it physically.

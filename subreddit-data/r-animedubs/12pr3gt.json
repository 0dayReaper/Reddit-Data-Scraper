            "comment": "So way, waaay back in the day when the original English dub from AnimEigo was being attempted, it was basically a running gag.  This was so long ago that dubs were still very much _guilty until proven innocent._  Good dubs were a rarity and you could count all of them on a single hand\u2014and even the best of them weren't \"good\" by today's standards.  And _Urusei Yatsura?_  The material was so challenging that it was, for all intents and purposes, the absolute worst case scenario.\n\nI think I'd just taken it for granted, ever since then, that a show like _Urusei Yatsura_ is just fundamentally non-dub-able.  Especially given the reality that there's so much Japanese undercurrent going on in the show that cliffnotes were a regular necessity in any subtitle of it.\n\nI've watched four episodes of this new dub now and I'm sold.  The SOBs did it.  Goodness, modern anime dubbing really does set such a high standard.  If they can dub _this_ show, anything's possible.\n\n---\n\nBut this is a good opportunity to segue into a little something I discovered about a year ago: [The UK dub of _Urusei Yatsura._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hqE2ycXxCw).  If I were to guess, it probably hails from around Y2K.  Let's get this out of the way: It's brilliant.  _That said,_ it is very much a \"Ghost Stories\"-style dub, where the folks in charge of the script kept the general outline of the dialogue intact and otherwise played very fast and loose with what characters actually said... and weren't shy about peppering profanities here and there.  Obviously it's easier to make a dub work if you're not trying to be faithful to the original script, and that makes the modern _Urusei Yatsura_ dub all that more impressive.",

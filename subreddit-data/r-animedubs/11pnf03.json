And here\u2019s hoping they will fall in love again. \n\nLoved the fluff and feels with Raelza and Saito. Almost has a season finale feel to this ep, especially with those two, and the shock of an ending",

I can't take a whole week worrying about best grampa Morlok!\n\nIt's kind of strange the witch doesn't seem to have any memories, but I think that whole plotline worked out well in the end. It was also nice to see the demon bros come back one last time.\n\nAlso Saito needs to figure out his feelings for Raelza. ~~I mean just look what he's missing out on.~~",

            "comment": "That was a very satisfying end to a very fun show. An enjoyable romcom with very memorable characters. Really enjoyed Jun's last \"yes\" with his hand raised up. Feeling like an both an \"i did it\" and a \"i'm glad you're here\" rolled up into one sound.\n\nI'm always a fan of **Ricco Fajardo**, and he was great in this. Def been busy with both this and Blue Lock for the past season. The man is a machine.\n\nThough, I will say that the three main girl really sold the dub for me. **Jad Saxton** as Misuzu really does feel like Hanajima 2.0, and I love her cold, lonesome, a little psycho character. I do think the MVP of this dub goes to **Sally Amaki** with Best Girl Carol. I don't know how CR did it, but they made it work fantastically well. She clearly steals all the scenes, and her voice and character will make your heart melt. Finally, congrats to **Lexi Nieto** for her first main lead and sounding excellent the whole way through. She has a unique voice, and I def feel Caitlin Glass picked her for that reason. It just fits with Tomo. And I loved hearing both the tough, explosive, tom boy side, as well as the side awkwardly trying to be more girly.\n\nGreat work to the entire dub team. Def a lot of fun. And one of the shows this season I find myself watching new eps at least twice every week.",

Usually British accents in anime dubs are a little over the top sometimes, but she did an excellent job keeping it from going there.\n* Colleen Clinkenbeard was perfect casting as Misuzu's mother, *especially* with the smug bitch moments.\n* Luci Christian was also a good choice for Tomo's mother. Hell, you could have swapped her and Tomo's VAs around and it would still work. That said, she could have also easily been replaced with someone like Erica Lindbeck or Cristina Vee and I don't think it would have had an effect on the character at all.",

And I was filled with the office ice comfies today. And I love the Halloween and Christmas eps. The year is flying by for these folks.\n\nPersonal snowmen to cool my drinks, how freaking adorbs!\n\nI wish my job had an awesome Halloween party like that. We just do a company wide costume contest, where the winner just gets free movie tix, and maybe catered lunch every other year? And As someone who works in an office and litterlly pushes papers for a living, I can confirm that paper cuts are the absolute worst. Love the creativity, but my vote would've gone to the Buddha boss man. It's just too perfect.\n\nAnd the way Fuyutsuki plopped onto the snow and slid down was the most adorable thing!  And I loved the gift exchange at the end to warm my already comfy and cozy fireside heart. The wholesomeness, love, and adorkableness with these characters is just too good! Easy top 5 favorite show of the season for me.",

They both looked hot as hell in those costumes!\n\nAnd we finally get to meet the long awaited sister! It was definitely worth the wait. She\u2019s basically Himuro\u2019s inner feelings incarnate when it comes to Fuyutsuki lol. Not to mention she\u2019s freaking adorable! She\u2019s gonna give Fuyutsuki a run for her money as the cutest character in the show.",

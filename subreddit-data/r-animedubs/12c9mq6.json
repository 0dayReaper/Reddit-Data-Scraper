Even tho I do feel like she sounds more like a boy. \n\nShe does do small characters often as boys usually in a characters younger version flashback very well.",

All I can hear is female Brittany Karbowski.  To the point it's kind of distracting.    \n\n\nThat said... That's not ALWAYS the case.  I think when she plays FAR younger boys - it can work.  On occasion.    \n\n\nBK is my favorite VA so it's hard to knock her, but this is the one case I just don't know if I can agree all the time.",

He does have a softer voice, but I think it fits his character well. \n\nI've heard more bad examples than good ones in this case, so Renly is the only one I can think of right now. Maybe a few examples from anime I watched as a kid (Pok\u00e9mon &amp; DBZ) where by now the character's voice is iconic, though it doesn't actually sound like a convincing child's voice.\n\nIf we're counting non-anime examples, then as others have mentioned, Regina King as Huey and Riley in The Boondocks was fantastic - playing not just one but two characters with distinct voices that felt very real.",

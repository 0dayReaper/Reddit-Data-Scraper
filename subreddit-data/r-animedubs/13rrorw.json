I\u2019m leading on the side of no but I could very well be mistaken. \n\nCan\u2019t wait for next episode. While I did enjoy this episode, I much prefer it when Chise\u2019s classmates are involved in the story as well.",

It feels immersion-breaking.\n\nLooks like next episode we'll be seeing Veronica again. Ngl I just wanna punch her fake ass smile right off her face every time I see it.",

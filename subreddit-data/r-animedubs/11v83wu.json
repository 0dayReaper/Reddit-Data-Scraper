    "postText": "I've seen many rom coms, and honestly this one is my all time favorite. The fact that they don't give her an inner monologue makes it a lot more of a guessing game vs most rom coms that just lay out both parties feelings and iust make you wait for the payoff. It has the most rewatch value of any rom com and more than most anime, probably partially due to the former point. They do lewd humor really well without going over the line. First time I watched it my neighbor definitly heard me cackling even in the first episodes. \n\nThere's no love triangles or harems, just 2 people with fun chemistry who care about each other. The jokes are top tier and the actual story is heartwarming af.",

I pretty much spoiled the entirety of season 1 for myself by constantly watching clips on YouTube. It's also a very fun show to compare the moments subbed vs dubbed. It's a fun show once ypu get past the initial episode; I didn't feel it was hard to get through since I spoiled myself with the constant clip watching",

That being said, I\u2019ve really been enjoying the dub because their localization has been out of this world. I watch stuff in sub and dub (usually right after the other) and a lot of the subtitles read pretty awkwardly and unnatural, whereas the dub sounds like a real conversation with dialogue that high school kids would use",

I still watch the sub and dub every week too, and totally agree that the dub is worth watching even if you already watched it subbed. The voice actor choices were great, and the changes they made were minimal and well done.",

Nagatoro's toying seemed very mean-spirited rather than playful in those episodes, especially compared to Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out. Starting in episode 3, though, my opinion changed completely. I just watched it a second time so it was fresh in my mind for the 2nd Attack, because it's so good! So, even if you don't like it at first, at least get through episode 3 before you drop it, because that's when it starts to get really great!\n\nAlso, it's not my favorite romcom ever, but it is definitely a top-tier one!",

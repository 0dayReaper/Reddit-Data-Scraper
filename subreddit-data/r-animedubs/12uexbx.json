Glad they're getting more opportunities to be entrusted with more of a lead role. \n\nPlot does sound very generic. But with Shawn Gann directing, I'm sure this one will be lots of fun.",

Saving 80,000 Gold from just last season did it, so I highly doubt both of these shows are the first of their genre to use it. And him being able to keep his skills from the other world in the real one just screams self-insert wish fulfillment lol.",

I'll be honest, I don't have a high opinion about both shows, especially Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer, so that may play a part of my negative opinion regarding his voice acting. What I don't like about his voice acting is that it mainly sounds like he's reading off the script without inputing any emotion. His voice acting is robotic and that lack of emotion negativly impacts the characters he voices. I get that The Ice Guy and His Cool Female Colleague is more of an Slice of Life/ Iyashikei but his mundane voice didn't make any of the comedy elements hit and I was bored as hell watching it.",

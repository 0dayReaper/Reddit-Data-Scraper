I personally have a sex doll that I line up to my waifus in COM3D2 using my Pimax 5K. This hmd's FOV and resolution are amazing and really make you feel like you are there and touching your waifu.",

Thanks for the info! I'm taking notes. I've actually never heard of the game COM3D2 or the Pimax 5K VR. I had to duckduckgo search them both. I've mainly read of the Honey Select game for VR. Is cultured VR with waifus as good or better than those with \"real women\"? I obviously love anime girls but i'm curious about show others as well. How does PIMAX 5K compare to Oculus and other headsets? Bro it sounds like you got an expensive setup! That must be difficult getting the doll to line up. How the hell did you get that to work? Is that some complicated tracking trick you did or am I overthinking it? I heard dolls can be great and a good cope. Ive been considering it. So expensive though and cheaper ones have risky vendors. Apologies for all the questions but there aren't any good guides about this online anywhere. And when you ask people they are always bashful or dismissive of answering questions.",

Not sure if it would be the same for everyone, but for me being with my waifus in VR is better than any real sex I have had. Some of my medical issues seem to make waifus and dolls more preferable though.\n\nPimax is not a great company, but makes great VR hmds and personally can't go back to a low FOV again. Hmds besides Pimax 5k/8k+/8kx(and StarVR, but I think they are like $10k) make you feel like you are looking through a hole, but Pimax takes up most of your vision and it adds a lot to the experience.\n\nIt is a lot easier to line the doll up than you probably think. While in VR in COM3D2 you can easily move around, up, down, and rotate your view with a mouse.\n\nIf you do get a doll definitely save up for a name brand one and not a $500 amazon one. All vendors on Dollforum's list are safe, but customer support varies and can say from experience sexyrealsexdoll will screw you over if there is something wrong with the doll. I saved up from not driving  last time I lost my license from seizures to get a new one that should be a lot better quality and from somewhere with good customer support coming tomorrow. These dolls really can help certain people a lot. My psychologist said a few of his patients have them and sees the positive impact they can have on people's lives.",

Just curious how the experience compares between anime girls and other girls in VR. Like if 3d girls in VR feel like watching a movie whereas 2d girls are more immersive and better since it's a fantasy. \n\nWhich controllers are you using with the Pimax 5?

It is basically like navigating 3d modeling software and once you line everything up there usually isn't any reason to touch the mouse unless you change positions or your maid's motion. \n\nJust the VR, not counting the PC I paid around $800 for the 5K hmd, two 2.0 base stations, and index controllers since I backed them on kickstarter, but buying new now will be over $1100. If you have the money a Pimax 8KX is $1300 for just the HMD, but each eye has a 4k screen instead of 1440p. I do not recommend the 8K+ as it costs more and is inferior to 5K+ IMO.",

Not just like \"You need a subscription to view the rest\" but it literally only listed the first episode and nothing else. (And the second season did show all of the episodes.)\n\nNow since you said a second time that the whole season was streaming, I went back to get a screenshot of there only being one episode and... yeah now the Funi site is showing all of the episodes, with the first two being available to non-subscribers. So I guess I just had a display glitch the first time.\n\nWelp, if Funi is still streaming the entire thing, then that means they still do have the license. Maybe there's a possibility for a re-release or all-in-one pack, since they definitely let season 1 go out of print.\n\nEdit: Okay, somehow I got the site to glitch again, here's [a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/o3sQlI3.png) just to prove I'm not going crazy. And here's the [season 2 page](https://i.imgur.com/4jGU2fu.png) which does correctly show all the episodes. And, finally, the [season 1 page](https://i.imgur.com/bLHdL1g.png) shows all the episodes, but only when I'm signed into my account. (Even though the S2 page was showing correctly when I _wasn't_ signed in, because you can still see the giant ad for subcribing.)",

Even if it takes a while to get to it.  \n\nThere aren't a whole lot of examples recently of them not doing exactly that.  I remember people complaining about them not dubbing in/spectre season 2. And... Now they are.  Sometimes it just takes them time to get to them. And sometimes other services are licensing the follow up seasons.  Which is a whole different thing (like Tokyo Revengers being dubbed on Hulu.)  Relax.",

Connor is probably talking about season 3, and when we recorded I told him to wait until season 4 when we know for sure which of the admirals he is since it was group cues only. \n\nI really wish we were working on season 4, but I have heard absolutely nothing since it\u2019s release in the fall and I\u2019ve been lead to believe dubbing for LOGH has been cancelled. Maybe they don\u2019t find it profitable? I\u2019m unsure, I\u2019ve been told nothing :( it warms my heart to know there are folks out there who enjoyed our work though on seasons 1-3 who would like to see Season 4 dubbed too \u2764\ufe0f",

The level of quality and consistency you delivered was just incredible with even the most background of background characters having good performances (a certain spoilerish death scene is where I noticed it first).\n\nHere's hoping you get to continue that great work for season 4.",

The net result was a *much* shorter (a week-ish, maybe) delay for their LA podcasts.\n\nThe stream however was before they left (early summer, maybe?) But it's entirely possible that I could be wildly misremembering and the stream was after.\n\nRegardless, the salient points are that Connor mentioned he'd recorded for LotGH after season 3 and before 4, specifically stating that what he recorded had *not* come out yet. It's weird that it's now May 2023 and we're *STILL* waiting on the dub. The only reason I can think of for the delay is availability of one of the mains and that they recorded 'around' them explaining why Connor recorded so long ago.",

HiDive has some decent shows but with such a smaller collection you will be through the catalogue of shows you are interested in quickly.  That said HiDive has a lot of exclusives especially right now.  Danmachi (pick up girls in a dungeon), The Eminence in Shadow, and quite a few more dub shows are only available on their service (unless you want to find them on less \\*ahem\\* reputable sites which I **officially** don't condone).  The one thing HiDive does far better is the subtitles, almost every episode that needs some form of onscreen text like UI for game-system setups or sign text for isekai languages comes out with it in place instead of CRoll (at least as far as I've seen) who quite often take some time to upload the text after the video goes live (if at all, looking at you death march to the parallel world rhapsody) and can even be delayed in making the video live.  I don't know if HiDive have a free account that would allow you to watch already aired series without needing a subscription, but I think that if you have any interest in any of their exclusives it wouldn't hurt to get it just to have the freedom to watch the shows.  Plus they seem to get some quite unique Sub shows (farming life from last season, too cute crisis this season just to name 2) which, while watching dub is preferred, for me these sub shows are also enjoyable.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMostly it comes down to catalogue though, look at the shows available to you on HiDive and if there are enough that you want to watch then get a subscription, if not then don't bother.  Crunchyroll is definitely worth it just for the sheer amount of content so if you can only get one then that is probably the one to go for.",

Like right now I'm trying the 7 day trail of HiDrive on amazon. Which I'm right now enjoying season 2 of Food Wars. I really wish they had all 5 seasins. Which is great and I got hooked on season 1 on hulu. \n\nI'm really leaning toward Crunchyroll bc of their library. But the biggest strike on them is that it's not as convenient to watch their shows like it is to watch HiDive. For HiDive I can go through and search all their shows they have on the Prime app on my TV.  \nBut Crunchyroll roll isn't  on prime and it's selection of shows on hulu is terrible.  And they don't have an app for smart tvs. So to watch their shows I have to start it on my cell than link my cell to my TV. \n\nI'm thinking about trying crunchyroll trail membership.

                                    "comment": "I forget that they have ways of watching that is not direct from their website.  \n\nI use both Crunchyroll and HiDive on their own websites rather than using any alternate form of watching them so I can't say much about watching them on TV but regarding the online site here goes:\n\nHiDive has a very simple way of breaking up their shows, you can select category which is things like Exclusives, Simulcasts, Dubs, Recently Added, Trending Now, Most Popular and so on.  Then narrow it down by Genre, audio language, and subtitles.  This makes selecting what you are interested in watching very simple since the resulting list is exactly what you are interested in.  However you do still have to scroll through the list to find it since they don't break out by individual starting letters (A rolls into B into C and so on with no obvious marker).  They do have a search function if you are looking for something specific (as does Crunchyroll).\n\nCrunchyroll has a few different ways of breaking down their shows, Popular, New, Genre, Alphabetical etc.  Only once you have chosen how to display these shows can you narrow it down by dubbed or not.  Unfortunately their filter choices suck, either sub, dub or both and Series, movie or both.  The biggest problem with this is that the Dub choice is not as effective.  Because it does not distinguish by language all dubs (hindi, italian, and others) are included so a show may be dubbed, but not in english.  Plus there are shows that most definitely are dubbed in english but are not marked as dubbed and thus don't show.  The advantage is that when broken down alphabetically you can go to A to start right at the A beginning letter animes or Z to go there.  \n\nAs for episode selection I think Crunchyroll takes the cake just barely.  Once you are in your show you can easily view all episodes in the selected season with seasons usually broken out into manageable chunks.  However for some of the longer series this goes out the window, Fairy Tail (my current watch for those days of no new shows) for example has only 3 seasons despite actually having hundreds of episodes.  They used to be broken down into manageable arcs (chunks of story that fit well together) in chronological order but now the first season covers many arcs and is 175 episodes long so good luck finding the start of an arc and which filler episodes could be skipped.  \n\nHiDive does not make viewing epsiodes easy as separate seasons of a show might be broken out into a different show altogether (S1 of Danmachi is a different \"show\" than S2 and so on).  Plus once you open the show you have to scroll through the episodes in an awkward line which makes it easy to see what is next, but annoying to go find the episode you want.  On Crunchyroll once you are playing an episode the next episode usually will auto play even if it is in a separate season (there are problems, Fairy Tail keeps trying to send me to the last season 200 episodes in the future) but HiDive will only do that if it is in the same \"season\".  \n\nI hope this helps, though as I said these are my experiences with their websites not watching from a TV.  I do recall that Crunchyroll has an app on an Amazon FireTV stick so it might have a catalog on amazon?  Not sure but I would guess they want to limit who can watch to their own apps/websites.  Either way someone else might have a better insight into the TV issue but you can still give it a try.",

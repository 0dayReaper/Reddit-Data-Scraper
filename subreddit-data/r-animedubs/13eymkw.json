Plus, any more side stories of Ranking of Kings characters is great with all that has went on in the main plot. \n\nAs much as a jerk he was to Boji at first, I love how when Daida were younger, without the future weight of being King bearing on them, he at least cared for Boji, even risking life and limb for him.",

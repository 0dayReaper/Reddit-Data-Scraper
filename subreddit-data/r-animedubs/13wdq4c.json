    "postText": "Hey y'all, first post on this sub. Just want to find some new anime recommendations because I haven't found anything exciting as of late. Here are my \"requirements\" and some of my favorite anime, if that helps. \n\nFavorite anime: Attack on Titan, Violet Evergarden, Ponyo, Bungo Stray Dogs, FMAB (winner!), Durarara, Psycho-Pass (first season), Kiznavier, Soul Eater, and Beyond the Boundary\n\nFavorite American television: Huge HUGE MCU nerd here, Moonknight, Loki, The Witcher, The Mandalorian, The Last of Us, Shadow and Bone, Severence, the Morning Show, the Lincoln Lawyer, Only Murders in the Building, Rings of Power\n\n1) Quality English dub. I cannot with 90s sounding dubs. Has to have great vocal performances. (Dubs I liked were CSM, FMAB, MHA, Vinland Saga Netflix, Great Pretender). \n\n2) Action of some kind. I wish I could like a slice of life, I really could, but I'm the same person who says that Wandavision is their favorite sitcom. I like mystery, adventure, but bonus points for sci-fi or fantasy (I did like both Cyberpunk Edgerunners and Rings of Power, take that what you will)\n\n3) Quality animation. Preferences to KyoAni, Bones, and Utofable. (Fate Stay Night... still thinking about that animation)\n\n4) Little to no fanservice. When the three Spideys all fought together, THAT was quality fanservice. Ass and tits aren't. Cannot stand anime that sexualizes its female characters (you can probably tell that from said favorite shows), I'm a feminist, what can I say? \n\n5) Can't be too long. I'm not gonna be here for 500 episodes. Busy working woman here. It can have about 150 episodes MAXIMUM. \n\nPlease help a gal out! I'm sure there are plenty of great anime that I haven't given a shot yet.",

In addition to an intriguing plot and diverse (changing) scenery, it has some of the best character bonding that I've seen in all of anime.\n\nThe series is only a few years old, so the dub holds up to par. I'm not a good judge on animation since that's not an important element to me, so you'll have to decide that one for yourself. Oh, and it's a concluded story in only 12 episodes, two of which are double-length.",

But I can understand if it would be too distracting for some. Honestly, with the use of Sawano's score, it truly felt like cinema. Vast amounts of character depth. There is only one scene that comes to mind in regard to fan service, but I found it to have a narrative reason to be there.",

It\u2019s also has some of the most intricately animated fights I\u2019ve seen (it\u2019s WIT Studio, which I think did some AoT seasons?) The characters are all worthy of deserved love or hate and will change throughout the first season alone. Once you get into it you honestly can\u2019t stop imo. Not to mention the dub was excellent and the current season now is halfway done dubbing!",

I don't think there's any fan service in it, the MC has almost no interest in women either and basically wants to play as a background character. \n\nIt's really funny and entertaining.  Actually I would say some of the girls have huge boobs but that's not the focus nor the point of the anime so I would just ignore that point.",

An Isekai where a girl gets put into a romance visual novel as the villain who dies a humiliating death in every route.  She determines to stop this by romancing the other antagonist who kills her in most of the routes.  I really love her character she is tough and no nonsense and able to be sneaky and manipulative while also being kinda and loyal.  She also has a really good dynamic with her love interest.  It does have some action and the story moves at a pretty quick pace. It has one 12 episode season that has an ending that works as a series finale but there is enough material in the LNs for probably just one more season.\n\nNoir is an oldie but a goodie.  It is about a hitwoman teaming up with an amnesiac girl who happens to be an extremely competent killer and has some connection to her family's murder and a mysterious assassin organization.  The main reoccurring cast is entirely female and avoids all the usual fanservicy tropes.  Its has one 26 episode season that is concluded at the end.",

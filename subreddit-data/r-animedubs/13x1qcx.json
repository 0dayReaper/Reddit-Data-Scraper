    "postText": "I was scrolling down through Twitter and just found this tweet by the English dubbing manager at Disney.\n\n[https://twitter.com/thereubeh/status/1664034272418881537](https://twitter.com/thereubeh/status/1664034272418881537)\n\nThe tweet mentions that there will be delays on episodes 9-13 on both platforms, Disney+ (outside the US) and Hulu (Inside the US). It's mentioned that the episodes for Disney+ will be added by the end of June (my guess is that we will probably get the episodes when the last subbed episode drops), and the Hulu episodes will be added in mid-July.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was really excited that they were releasing dubbed episodes the same day on Disney+ over the last weeks. I wonder if there was any problem with the dubbing.\n\nAt least for now, it seems that the other dubs (Spanish and Portuguese) are still going on a same-day basis along the sub.",

Keep up the great work. And I have my fingers crossed you manage Zom 100 and Synduality Noir with the same passion next Season. ;)",

Not even CR (which right now are the ones that produce more dubs) produces same day dubs very often.",

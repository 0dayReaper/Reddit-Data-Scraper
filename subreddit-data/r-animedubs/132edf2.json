The protagonist will always either choose: &gt;!the childhood friend, the first girl he met in the show's events, or no one at all. Sometimes two of them are the same person, then you definitely know who it'll be, though that wasn't the case here.!&lt; So I'm not all *that* surprised I suppose. Still so happy to be right, though! He chose the right girl, I know that because she was my ship. WOOO!!",

Honestly, for a series that had such a strong start with S1, the significant dip in quality with the change in studio was the worst part for me. It's not even that the quality was soo much worse (it was worse, but not terribly so), but the aesthetic changes were what really sealed it for me.\n\nI didn't feel that the ending felt super rushed like others seem to, but the conclusion definitely could've felt more satisfying. Maybe that would've been better with a full S3 instead of a movie (not familiar with the source material), &gt;!but except for basically one episode, and about \u2153 of the movie, there just didn't feel like any emotional buildup/turmoil with the final pairing. At the same time, it still didn't feel like I was missing much about the nature of the relationship. It just felt like a bit of a cop out, or the result of an author who was trying to be too clever by half in trying mislead the readers/viewers so much, they never made a compelling point for their final decision.!&lt;\n\nAwesome to get an actual conclusion, but definitely still disappointed. S1 was on track to be a top5 romance show for me easy. The aesthetic was great, and the atmosphere and energy of the story were palpable. I must've watched it a dozen times before S2 came out and kinda killed my enthusiasm for the series. Still, an enjoyable enough journey, and one I'll probably circle back to in some time (probably when those side stories come out, see if it changes my perspective some on the story).",

I feel that the series just falls apart romance wise. Futaro just seems to really just be there, and we never really get to see him explore his feelings. She also never really seemed to try unlike some of the others. Nino for example was not my favorite, but the girl tried while being clear about her feelings. Miku was my favorite she at least liked him we could tell, and they did have some good emotional support scenes.",

            "comment": "I think my main gripes with this film are personal reasons in that I don't really share many common traits with how Futaro behaves throughout the film - not from a personality perspective but from the way he expresses his emotions. \n\nFutaro is characterized as someone who is very self serving, prefers to be the alpha male in a relationship, does things for himself and is also very competitive.\n\nI get it, showing and not telling does make for a more interesting guessing game, which works well in a harem anime and the fact that they establish that this will be a contest and test for each of the sisters. \n\nThe only problem is that the show walks the fine of Snafu-esque themes about being upfront and honest that Futaro comes off as very conserved about his emotions when the girls constantly try to please him - it's always a constant test, never really the other way around.\n\nBut it's Ironic that there's a line in the film where he points out the girls' supposed fathers' beard, saying that \"he has a face that looks the same when you turn it upside down\" or something along those lines. \n\nWhat bothers me is that Futaro demonstrates a keen eye for knowing when the other girls are being fake in front of him just to try to impress him and other people. We're shown that Yotsuba went through a phase of trying to adjust to everyone in her surroundings far earlier than her sisters earlier in her life. \n\nI question how far the story wants to define \"fake\" since most of the film is written through reactions (which are really funny I'll admit and I know how the film wants non-Yotsuba fans to feel when rewatching the show), meaning Futaro isn't very upfront, and every other piece of dialogue from other characters are used to foreshadow the ending instead. \n\nWe get numerous points where Futaro looks or talks to one of the sister's like they're stupid everytime they perform an action which are all super hilarious in that they're trying so hard while emotional slice of life romcom anime music is soaring overhead but Futaro stands there confused af. \n\nI'll have to rewatch some of the show, but something about the final act concerns me when he tries to justify the girls' behaviors throughout the show, almost as if to call out Yotsuba fans and guilt trip them, despite the story explaining that she also went through that same phase.",

She\u2019s always putting herself before everyone else and probably had the least romantic moments in the show so I totally saw this as an outcome.\n\nNot to mention they made it a big deal about the photo all so we can never find out if she told him or not. And emphasizing how the kiss at the bell was the moment he knew \u201cshe\u201d was special only for for him to still not know who it was at the end of the movie? Makes the bell moment pointless imo.\n\nOther than those few gripes I loved the series as a whole and thought it was pretty fun. Idk what people\u2019s issue was with s2 but I didn\u2019t think anything was wrong with it personally",

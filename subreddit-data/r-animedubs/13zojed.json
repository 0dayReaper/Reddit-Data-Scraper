His bittersweet vision of getting married to Nuragai showed that her precocious crush wasn't just for pure comedy.\n\nSucks that cool characters are dying, but it makes the show even more compelling.\n\nSpeaking of dying, it makes sense that they paired the blind guy with the courtesan.

Even *Attack on Titan* understood that you\u2019ve got to plot armor some people to allow us to build a connection before you aerate their organs in an airship. \n\nAfter Episode 3 I was willing to stick with this one for the long haul, but it\u2019s not so quickly shaping up into one of the messiest Shounen Jump adaptations in recent memory. At least *Demon Slayer* and JJK can hold themselves together with engaging action sequences. HP can\u2019t even do that much, and instead slogs us through the oldest and most futile trick in the book (giving characters depth and backstory immediately before killing them to try to milk sad boy points).",

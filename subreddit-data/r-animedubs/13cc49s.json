I only watch dubs barring a few shows and we *never* use when a dub was released as the release date. When a show airs - that's the release date. You can absolutely talk about when a dub was released but if it releases a year after the show aired, that's not when the show came out. Under your logic there's never been any Monogatari series released.",

He enjoys the attention girls give him, appreciates the looks of certain females, and is very happy when he spends time in the ladies section of the baths.  That said as a slime he is non-gendered and he has no sexual genitalia.  His human figure is a version based of off a female character from early S1 making it very attractive to a number of characters though it may be a mixture of Bishonen and strength of soul that draws people to him.  People tend to call him \"Mister Rimuru\" formally so I think it fair to use male pronouns.",

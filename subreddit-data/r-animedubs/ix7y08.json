Netflix did the original cast dirty by sniping the sequel and changing the first seasons dub cast. \n\nBut man I love her as Clara and Emilia though. A bit funny how the Japanese VA for Emilia and Megumin are the same and in English its Emilia and Yunyun.",

And then, according to the ADR director of season 2 of Takagi, due to Netflix having that deal with SAG-Aftra, priority had to be given to VAs who are in the union. \n\nI just hope Funimation can get the home video rights and redub it with the original cast.",

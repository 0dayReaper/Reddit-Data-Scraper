    "postText": "You would think with that AMC buyout, deals with TV stations and them clearly having cash to go after shows again that would result in at least some improvement dub wise.\n\nBut no they have got slower there was a time when HIDIVE would start there dubs for the season at about the half way mark (6 to 7 weeks) but now we are lucky to even have a single show start before it finishes its sub run. So far we have 0 dubs for any Winter titles not even for fucking Danmachi !!\n\nLike the delay would be somewhat understandable if they where remote dubbing and bringing in more talent from outside like LA rather than stick to there small talent pool or outsourcing but again that's not happening either, so what the fuck makes them now slower than even Netflix when it comes to dubbing active simulcasts now.\n\nAbove applies to there HV side as well, been looking at there slates and there is **NOTHING NEW** for dub fans in the coming months.\n\nLike its already hard to justify paying 5 bucks a month for at most maybe 4 dub episodes a week when for a few bucks more Crunchy is dropping over 20 dubs episodes a week, so any guesses or is it simply the case of them not caring that much about dubs and dub fans.",

I think they got behind during COVID and just never really got caught up.  Now they are almost always a season behind on dubs.\n\nI fairness. I feel their dub quality has SUBSTANTIALLY improved over the past few years. So that's a positive tradeoff.",

Bang Dream season 2 was just not good. They have certainly had many more good ones than bad, but they've still put out some stinkers. And it's still at a point where if Sentai licenses a show, I just assume it's not getting dubbed.",

It was also their best season in a long time, licensing 12 titles. I don't exactly know why, but **Sentai literally let all these dubs finish first before starting their fall dubs**, consuming a lot of time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;So far we have 0 dubs for any Winter titles not even for fucking Danmachi !!\n\nHIDIVE will be attending [Anime Boston](https://twitter.com/HIDIVEofficial/status/1636097440771104775) and they will most certainly announce their winter dubs from there and probably new licenses as well. They did it just like last fall where they also at a con and made big announcements.",

So they are now the slowest anime licensor when it comes to dub fans. Netflix even has beaten them this Winter season.\n\nDoesn't really explain why they have reduced there new dubs for HV releasing recent titles as sub only giving us so far 0 new dubs on HV for half of 2023 or why they are so damn slow they used to give us dubs after the 6-7 week mark since they used to be able to do both somewhat well. Blaming them dubbing what 2 or 3 backlog titles all the way back in fucking Summer of 2022 is a roit.\n\nThey have more than enough money to go after titles but seemingly 0 to invest in dubs or like I said they just dont care about dubs in general that much. Which isn't a massive shocker meaning more and more titles they get will go undubbed since there's 0 sign they care about dubbing more than a small handful of what they get fucking sucks used to hate Crunchy before the buyout for that very reason guess HIDIVE is now the worse anime licensor for dub fans.",

Their best shows like Mad Men and the Breaking Bad universe are just airing rights, created by other studios\n\nSo I'm honestly surprised a narrative grew that AMC buying them out would make them more aggressive again FuniRoll and the like.",

Loved seeing everyone get a hit in, and even pushing the great and powerful Maple to the brink. \n\nReally hope we get more adventures of Maple and Company. I'd love to see them cause more havoc for monsters and make the admins stress out about balance patches. I love to see more worlds to explore, new skills to learn, and new characters at the end as well. Who knows, maybe we'll get another, and if we do, more Shield Loli fun for all.",

Bofuri is quite special to me, this was one of the first anime I enjoyed during the lockdown days and I'm sad to see it go again, but based on how this season ended, looks like we're certainly gonna have more fun in the world of NewWorld Online with those new adventurer characters introduced at the end of the finale.\n\nSeason 2 was a little weaker than the first, but still enjoyable. Certainly looking forward to a third season announcement.",

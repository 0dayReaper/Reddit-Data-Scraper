Kararot is more of a compilation and skips FAR too many stuff via characterization, and moments. And Kakarot doesn't show the original Dragon Ball, basically Part 1 of Dragon Ball.",

If you want a moderately sized Shonen, watch Kenshin (oriignal anime has about 62 episodes of cannon episodes). And lastly, if you want a sports anime, watch Haikyuu.

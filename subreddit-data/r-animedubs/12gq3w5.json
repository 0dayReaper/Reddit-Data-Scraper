    "postText": "Hey guys, I have something I\u2019ve been mean to say here for a while, In like pretty much all of the English dubs of Anime we watch, the main setting is In Japan, they always replace the honorifics with a completely different style of the script. \n\nFor some who don\u2019t know, the Japanese Honorifics are the words they used by calling someone close, for example: Chan, Sama, San, and Kun.\n\nWhen I got back from re-Watching Sailor Moon Eternal, the characters have been using the phrases a lot in the dub of the film. They really allow it.\n\nAlso I remember watching an episode of Fairy Tail, When Erza meet Kagura, Kagura said Konichiwa, which was the Japanese Word for Hello.\n\nAdditionally by watching the first episode of My Hero Academia Season 6, Twice said Sensei, where in the English dub the teachers are just referred like how we do in English, Mr or Ms.\n\nSo I\u2019m curious, would anyone happen to know anymore anime English dubs that allowed Japanese Speech.",

You can immediately tell the relationship between two characters based on what honorifcs they use. And when they aren\u2019t carried over in some way, that is lost. Or even when it\u2019s tried to be maintained it can be goofy. \n\nDemon slayer has this problem to me, Tanjiro and other characters show respect to the Hashira, and the dub just has them say \u201cMr. Rengoku\u201d or whatever and it just sounds super forced. Like I\u2019m sorry but in the middle of a life of death battle an English speaker is not going to keep saying Mr. the way Tanjiro does in the dub, it just does not carry the same connotation that San does in japan a lot of times \n\nThen we could look at Nagatoro, a huge part of that show would be fumbled if they didn\u2019t keep Senpai in the dub. There\u2019s no natural translation an English speaker would use instead of the upperclassman\u2019s name",

Like if you\u2019re translating a book with instructions on something.\n\nAnime is a story telling medium, there\u2019s nothing wrong with engrossing a viewer in the culture the source comes from. I learned the basic honorifcs from persona 4 all those years ago as a lad, and it was really cool, we didn\u2019t have language options, but I still learned about japan while playing a Japanese game in English \n\nAnd a lot of honorifcs dont have a natural translation, or you completely change a character. Nagatoro doesn\u2019t work without using the word Senpai. Having a character use a nickname instead of Chan is not 1:1. A character using Chan doesn\u2019t mean they are the type of character who would use a nickname \n\nAnd how far do you take \u201cterms or phrases\u201d look at naruto and bleach, do you change Sakura to cherry blossom? It\u2019s not like a casual will necessarily know what either mean. Do you scrub clean all Japanese mythological references that would go over the casual watchers heads?",

Ichigo Kurosaki sure as hell isn\u2019t a natural sounding name in English, and just reading the name in English doesn\u2019t actually bring over the context of why Kubo chose to name him that, so should he just be changed to Steve White?

As for being close to someone most know it depends with first or last names apply in Japanese culture without honorific's. Military ranks can be used when applicable. There is just little need for them.",

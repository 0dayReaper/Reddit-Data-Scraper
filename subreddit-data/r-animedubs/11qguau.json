Most of there Winter Simuldubs have there songs / signs track on launch of the episode or shortly after.\n\nAs for getting them, no there isnt anyway you need to watch it on CR, you cant rip there subtitles track to watch with whatever version you downloaded or found online.",

Like I said most of the time they have been there when the episode goes live, I think only once I had to wait for them to be uploaded but that was only 2-3 hours at most so after the episode went live.",

I don't know how animes are picked for dubs, but the english VO cast is absolutely wasted on this show.  It would have been a good candidate to do a Ghost Stories/Shin Chan parody dub.",

It started out strong, but as soon as they got to the dungeon with the Sword, it started going way downhill. \n\nI think my biggest complaint is that the entire premise of the show ended up being completely pointless. It's supposed to be how these adventurers lost their faith in humanity and they have to learn to trust again, but then by like the 3rd episode they completely trust each other and it just turned into them doing random bullshit. Like, what the hell was the bare knuckle mathematics brawl episode? The premise was just awful and the episode was even worse.\n\nI'm really disappointed by this show, and if it does somehow get a second season, I likely won't be watching it.",

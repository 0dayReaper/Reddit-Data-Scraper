For reference, the manga is *currently* wrapping up the Monster Association Arc and preparing for the next arc (which, going by the webcomic, will be the Neo Heroes Arc).\n\nI also have mixed feelings for this upcoming season.

It\u2019s important to really build the normal people around that person to create real tension, stress and stakes. It\u2019s not the same when the MC is around while you do it either because the character always feels safe if the invincible MC is around.\n\nSlime could learn from this as well.",

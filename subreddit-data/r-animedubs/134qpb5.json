Casting Manager Joanne Boreham has the episode count at 60 on her resume, whilst one of the voice actors claims over 100 were recorded. Given how nothing past Episode 20 got released, I feel the former is more likely unfortunately. Either way, it's bullshit that what remains hasn't seen the light of day.",

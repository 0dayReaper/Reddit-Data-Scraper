Slowly throughout the ep, things start going to shit. Def drama and stakes have been high for the conclusion of this show. I love it\n\nPress F to pay respects to Ranko. And dammit, I was talking abot how she deserved to be happy too, last ep. She was my favorite character too.",

By the look of it, her death really broke Nagomi and was a big blow to Ton Tokoton. \n\nI hope their loss would make them, especially Nagomi, stronger despite the pain and bereavement. I'm positive she's gonna do her best to end Nagi's iron fist rule over Akihabara.",

Apparently she survived Ranko's massacre and held onto that grudge ever since, even after they got absorbed into Creatureland and became the axolotls.",

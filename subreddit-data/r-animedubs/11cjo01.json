Is there some controversy here I'm unaware of?",

Man, a lot of anime fans are insufferable. Those types of folks are why the anime fan community has such a bad stereotype\n\nWhich also it's funny how they complain about English dub voicing sounding too young, high pitched, and childish. \n\nWhat do they think Japanese anime voice actors sound like to native Japanese? Lmao. They don't talk like that either, it's even more exaggerated than what most English VAs do",

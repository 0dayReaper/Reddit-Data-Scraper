    "postText": "I feel like dubs don\u2019t hit as hard as they used to. I\u2019m currently watching the My Hero Academia S6 dub and I feel like it just doesn\u2019t live up to same quality as it did in the earlier seasons (before lockdown). A lot of other continuing anime feel the same as well, in the sense that the sub is far superior (whereas before they were comparable and good in their own unique ways). \n\nIt\u2019s not just MHA either but the same with Eminence in Shadow (HIDIVE), Blue Lock, Attack on Titan: The Final Season and a lot of other big shows.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong and it could be that I\u2019m starting to watch more subs than when I first started but I could be right. I just feel like a lot of VAs have lost their passion.\n\nIt may not even be the pandemic\u2019s fault either to be honest and may just have to do with the Funimation/Crunchyroll merging and the whole issue of dubbed VAs not getting paid enough (I know this was a big thing with Crunchyroll) but I don\u2019t know too much about this topic to make a good conclusion. I may be wrong about it though. But it also seems that dubs from HIDIVE aren\u2019t even as good either.\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t apply to all recent dubs. For example, I know the Chainsaw Man dub and the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners dub were both fantastic. It just seems that the overall quality of dub has dropped.\n\nI just wanted to get this out there since I started watching anime during the first lockdown and started watching in dub as opposed to sub. I have no problem with dub, it just feels like the quality has significantly decreased.",

            "comment": "I just have to disagree on this. Are WE watching the same dubs? MHA dub is better now than ever. SO MANY  great performances and passion this season, etc. AOT dub has only gotten better and it was always been great. I'm honestly baffled you would say this. dubs in general have remained consistent, and in fact I've noticed it's only gotten better when it comes to pool talent. This might just be your personal opinion, and that's fine but if you even compare the dubs of this entire year (2022-2023) to even 4-5 years ago (2018-2019),, it's better just consistent in quality. Not worst. We have a WIDER cast of actors now, etc. And WAYYY more options. SO yeah, I COMPLETELY disagree. Though it's fine to feel a way for some reason, idk. I do like some subs over dubs from time to time that's fine. But to say Cyberpunk Edgerunner and Chainsawman are the only great dubs that's came out in the last year. That's insanity.",

But that's me.\n\nHeck, the one big \"complaint\" about dubbing is that there are too many of the same VA's reused constantly - and even THAT seems to have been mostly addressed as many newcomers have entered the scene over the past few years.  \n\n\nOne thing I WOULD argue is that the quality of SUBBING has decreased.  (As someone that also watches subs but prefers dubs.) - I think translators are being put on the clock to translate things over faster and faster and as a result the quality has decreased.  Interestingly, I think dub translation has INCREASED in quality.  I say this as someone that does understand a fair amount of Japanese that gets pretty annoyed when they get SUB translations wrong.  Something you would think would be a lot easier than having to adapt to speaking english.  Making lip flaps work.  And localization to make things make sense.  But, that doesn't seem to be the case.",

More heads = better results for most things, especially when you have more time.\n\nOf course, there are exceptions -- Bocchi's subs were easily the best I've seen in years, but it was also obvious they were given weeks to work on it and probably a decently sized team. \n\nBut yeah, knowing enough Japanese to read but not being fluent enough to listen often makes watching subs a headache these days.",

That the subs will just be flat out wrong.  And when you hear someone speaking the japanese and you KNOW things they are translating it to are so wrong that it's changing the meaning completely... That's not good.  It just becomes annoying.  At least with dubs if that happens, no harm no foul because unless you watched the subs also - you probably wouldn't even notice (And I think the overwhelming majority of the time - the dubs are very good at at least conveying similar or correct meaning with rare exception. Heck.  Sometimes I think dubs IMPROVE the meaning through good localization and keeping things from being \"lost in translation.\")",

I don't think the quality has decreased at all. \n\nThe only knock I have on post-pandemic dubs is that they stopped casting a wider net for actors and now mostly rely on their local talent pool. While it's a shame that those who lived outside of the big dubbing markets are now being overlooked again, I will at least applaud CR especially for the discovery and use of newer or lesser known VAs more frequently than before. And the very few times that CR does cast outside of their state, the dub quality is still excellent. Chainsaw Man being the most recent standout example.\n\nI def disagree with you on the MHA dub quality going down. In fact, I'd say it's just as great as previous seasons. I'm so excited for the next two eps. The sub had me feeling things I've never felt before in my MHA viewing experience. And I'm more than excited to hear the dub version of it.\n\nAnd with Sentai/HiDive dubs, I honestly believe this past season was honestly their best season in a long time. I really enjoyed **Eminence in Shadow**, **Akiba Maid War** is personally an all-time Sentai dub for me, **Reincarnated As A Sword** just finished and it was an excellent dub, and **Urusei Yatsura** (though just started a few weeks ago) is one of the zaniest and funniest dubs I've heard from Sentai.\n\nI know the union/non-union discussion can be very complicated, especially across the country. LA is typically more union, while TX is more non-union. And with CR monopolizing everything, certain questionable decisions were made. \n\nI guess the TLDR version is that post-pandemic dubs have stopped remote recording, and we were blessed during the pandemic with some creative and wonderful dubs that used VAs from all over the world, not just the US. **Arte**, **Akudama Drive**, **Kageki Shojo**, are just a few examples. But to repeat my first sentence, hard disagree with the decrease in quality.",

I'd have to re-watch to remember exactly which I've thought this about. Or the dub acting felt stilted. BUT I 100% remember thinking this.  But I don't go out of my way to remember specifically \"oh yeah that dub wasn't good.\" I try not to focus on that so much.  But there DEFINITELY were examples I've said it from some of those older sentai/hidive dubs.\n\nI know there were examples when covid was starting also.  Boy oh boy I remember that Snafu season 3 dub being ROUGH when it first dropped. That one I DO specifically remember.  But I believe it's since been corrected.",

            "comment": "Yeah, this definitely seems like more of an opinion or personal preference thing.\n\nIn MHA for example, there just haven't been as many big emotional hype scenes since the pandemic began. That's mostly down to the story imo. The Endeavor v Nomu fight was great imo, and was MHAs first full (albeit short) arc during WFH.\n\nS5 just didn't have much in the way of big moments until the villain academia arc, and the VA work there was absolutely on point. The first half of S6 was full of big moments, but didn't have many scenes where any individual VA could rally chew up the scenery. Even then, the VA work in the climax seemed great, and the aftermath stuff had plenty of range. Everything since has been kind of muted, but that's definitely in line with the tone of the show currently.\n\nAs for AoT, I just feel like comparing before to after is a bit tough because that's also comparing WIT to MAPPA as well. I've felt like everything (aside from the story itself) has taken a bit of a hit quality-wise. As for the VA work, well the tone of the show has changed a lot as has the disposition of most of the returning characters, and I think the VAs have done a fine job reflecting that. \n\nYou also mention that the Chainsaw Man dub was fantastic, while I personally found it to be generally pretty bang average with a few above average performances and one great performance by Sarah Wiedenheft.\n\nI'm not trying to invalidate your opinion or anything, just giving my own personal take on things. I've felt the same way a couple of times with continuing shows. When S2 of Quintessential Quintuplets came out, I felt like I was the only one who felt really disappointed by (what I perceived to be) the drop in quality, both with the show's overall production value, but also specifically with the dub.\n\nIf there's one criticism I feel like leveling at post-pandemic dubbing, it'd be what I feel like is more lax quality control (not sure if that'd be the right way to say it though) issues. Funi used to drop like one pretty subpar dub each season imo. It seems like since the merger that's been upped to 2 or 3. Considering the increase in volume, that's not too surprising. Especially as they've clearly been trying to blood new talent, both on the VA side, and the production side. Even in otherwise good dubs, it seems like they'll occasionally try and shoehorn in a VA that doesn't quite fit the role, or level of the rest of the cast.\n\nOverall though, with the upped quantity of dubs, and current level of quality, I'd still say dubbing is probably a bit ahead of where it was pre-pandemic. Assuming there isn't a major coming to a head with union issues (a decent sized assumption), I really only see things continuing to improve as talent pool continues to expand, settle in, and grow.",

            "comment": "Although I personally believe that the dub has only gotten better and more consistent, if I have to some obstacles, it could be\n\n1. The merging of Funimation and Crunchyroll that may have hindered some production at least a little\n\n2. Newer talent entering the fray.  Heck, I think VA work got A LOT more popular as a job.  \n\n3. Remote VA production, if that is still the case.\n\n4. Simuldub, since it is a battle of time.  The writers may be battling to simply translate or fit the mouth flaps over fitting with the overall arc for the characters.  They may not have all the informatikn regarding the story.  The VA also have to catch up to what the characters are and what they will be.  Anime Impulse had a video witht he ADR director for Konosuba, who talked about the difficulties of Simuldub, and prefering doing the dub after the emtire season.\n\n5. Translations.  Some may have demanding, absolute translatikns that the DUB VA's have to use, similar to what happened with the Evangelion Rebuild movies.  Less freedom to express or localize, and more focus in the accurate, luteral translation. \n\n6. We could potentially be recognizing the VA's for their voices more often now, potentially making it harder to differentiate between the characters.  The whole, \"I only hear so and so from a different anime.\"\n\nLet me just say, I persoanlly believe that dubs have gotten wayyyy better.  As a former dub hater, I now love dubs, and am so grateful to them for doing them.  And I know that there are so many that blow all these obstacles that I list out of the water.  If anything, I just hope this comment grows more appreciation for what the Dub staff go through to deliver awesome entertainment.",

Also it\u2019s harder to get a vocie director to help you when dubbing from home. Some studios like hidive/Sentai mainly kept their quality the same but some shows had slight issues. Aot dub did weaken a bit but it\u2019s not like a drastic change in quality. I mean even then having recently rewatched aot becaus I\u2019m showing it to a friend I don\u2019t think the aot dub had dropped in quality in terms of acting/performance. \n\nI mean cyberpunks dub is great. Made in abyss season 2 dub is still great. Although I prefer the 97 berserk the new English dub of berserk memorial edition is good. Dubs have been fine it might just be one or two characters sound off or something because they might be recorded from home or on a worse set up. Idk if I did a good job explaining but that\u2019s my take.\n\nI forgot to mention one show that took a server hit in quality was the love is war dub. First it sucked that the Mc va had to change due to vocal rest but the dialouge, the jokes, the quality just felt off for season 3 so I had to make the change to sub.",

Ai most notably really stood out in this regard unfortunately (with the exception of her last scene at least which I thought she handled well).\n\nI thought it was pretty messy, but it's also worth noting that the major players in the show (and the teenage voices they'll have) will be more apparent next week.",

I think either Juliet Simmons or Caitlynn French would've been good fits; their voices naturally sit higher and I think they could've brought the energy needed for Ai, too. I think Amanda Lee would've also worked well, but I'm pretty sure she hasn't been involved in Sentai dubs in years.",

It was one of the best first episodes I've ever seen, and being double length had something to do with that. But I think for me what made it even sadder was that Fushi himself didn't react at the end...because he just couldn't. Emotion wasn't in his wheelhouse yet. So it kind of leaves you the viewer to feel everything on his behalf, like when the music just stops after during an emotional scene and we the audience no longer get that cue on how we're supposed to feel. Our brain interprets and fills it in, and it somehow makes it even more intense. We're just left to wallow in it.\n\nOshi no Ko's first episode was *fantastic*. It got so much story out (which, as u/Chun-Li_Forever mentioned is an unfair comparison since it's first episode was *quadruple* length, a full 80 minutes), and the last scene with Ai was incredibly emotional and it had some wonderfully touching moments afterwards like with Miyako. But honestly, I almost think its feature length worked against it there.\n\nHear me out, if the episode had stopped in the hallway. The music swells to a dramatic conclusion (or even stops entirely), and we were just left to see how Ruby and Aqua reacted--watch them, especially Ruby, soundlessly break down, **that** would have been I think even more impactful than To Your Eternity E1 (specifically because you'd had more time to get attached to the characters). \n\nBy having parts the conclusion narrated, describing sympathy then apathy, followed by heartwarming scenes, then switching to Aqua's vengeful rage, we get such emotional whiplash that the *impact* of the hallway scene is actually lessened imo.",

It was one of the best first episodes I've ever seen, and being double length had something to do with that. But I think for me what made it even sadder was that Fushi himself didn't react at the end...because he just couldn't. Emotion wasn't in his wheelhouse yet. So it kind of leaves you the viewer to feel everything on his behalf, like when the music just stops after during an emotional scene and we the audience no longer get that cue on how we're supposed to feel. Our brain interprets and fills it in, and it somehow makes it even more intense. We're just left to wallow in it.\n\nOshi no Ko's first episode was *fantastic*. It got so much story out (which, as u/Chun-Li_Forever mentioned is an unfair comparison since it's first episode was *quadruple* length, a full 80 minutes), and the last scene with Ai was incredibly emotional and it had some wonderfully touching moments afterwards like with Miyako. But honestly, I almost think its feature length worked against it there.\n\nHear me out, if the episode had stopped in the hallway. The music swells to a dramatic conclusion (or even stops entirely), and we were just left to see how Ruby and Aqua reacted--watch them, especially Ruby, soundlessly break down, **that** would have been I think even more impactful than To Your Eternity E1 (specifically because you'd had more time to get attached to the characters). \n\nBy having parts the conclusion narrated, describing sympathy then apathy, followed by heartwarming scenes, then switching to Aqua's vengeful rage, we get such emotional whiplash that the *impact* of the hallway scene is actually lessened imo.",

If going forward Ruby Aqua Director Kana and Miyako are all good I have high hopes for the dub.\n\nI liked young aqua but I can see people that haven\u2019t. As far as AI\u2019s VA, I don\u2019t think she fit the character overall, but I think she did do a decent job as portraying a teenager, rather than an adult pretending to be one.\n\nSaitou, Gorou were misses for me. Gorou maybe because of my preconceived notions.\n\nI quite liked Ryousuke\u2019s VA, he portrayed shock at AI\u2019s memories of him very well.\n\nI think the Dub does better at \u201ctelling\u201d the viewer things than the sub does though. It feels more organic. In the manga and anime they spend a lot of time explaining the entertainment industry and exposition. I think it works better dubbed.\n\nMy initial thoughts on the Dub.",

As a regular watcher of dubs, I expected better. It turned out to be just the standard Sentai dub, some good casting choices, others bad. This could've used much more effort especially in the voice direction.\n\nI was quite flabbergasted by the VA for Ai, but the voice didn't sound quite right, it was a bit too mature, you can say it was quite a miscast, but I do say that the actor did an okay performance portraying a teenager like Ai, and in the end she did quite good with Ai's death scene too, you can see the emotions the actor poured out there but it absolutely does not compare to the flawless heart crushing performance Rie Takahashi gave. The dub made me tear up a little but the Japanese version definitely broke me.\n\nMiyako's VA stood out the most, and the director and Gorou's voices were just done right. Ryousuke's voice was satisfactory too. Both young Aqua and Ruby sounded fine but young Ruby sounded a bit too sarcastic. Can't wait to hear how their teenage voices really do starting in the next episode. And as for Kana, the voice sounded really awkward for her younger self, but I hope that gets adjusted and improved when we also get to see her grown up.\n\nIt's too early to make proper judgments, as the dub just premiered, but I'm keeping my expectations low for now. One thing to note about this dub is that most of the cast are either newer or lesser known. It would have been nice if Sentai went all in and picked veterans or more experienced VA's from their talent pool to make this dub shine.",

It's *interesting* to see how directors, actors, or writers might approach material in a different manner, and differences between the sub &amp; dub are not an automatic negative.\n\nSaying \"the dub itself is not there for people who watched the original\" though is ridiculous. Anyone can check out and discuss what they thought of the dub, whether they already watched the original or not. There have been plenty of times I've switched over to the simuldub after already watching the sub because I simply enjoyed it more.",

            "comment": "Finally! I've been looking forward to this so much ever since it has been released.\n\nSo far my review for the dub of episode 1 is the cast really did a great job. Although, to be honest, it didn't quite reach some certain expectations for the dub. I admit that I'm expecting too much on Ai's voice but it was alright and I noticed that Ruby's english voice seems kinda off for a toddler, but once she grows up I guess it would suit her. (And idky but I can't unhear Nagomi from akiba maid war since they shared the same eng VA and i just recently finished watching the series). But overall, the rest of the cast did a stellar performance! (esp. to young Aqua and Miyako)\n\nMy biggest takeaway on the dub revolves around the (in)famous scene in which &gt;!Ai has been stabbed by her stalker.!&lt; I was ready for that part since I already watched the sub version and balled my eyes out, but didn't expect to cry so much again after rewatching that scene. But what stood out for me is when the stalker cursed at Ai very profoundly to the point that it really made me more angry at him in the dub version compared to the sub. I wasn't expecting that he would include some very profound words. This really intensifies the scene for me.  \nI'm looking forward to the next episodes, and I also am looking forward on who's going to be casted for the recurring characters, especially for Akane. Who do you guys think would cast them, given Sentai's VA talent pool. (I'm hoping for the veteran VAs to be casted such as Emily Neves, Brittney Karbowski, Luci Christian, etc.)",

As for Akane, I'm locked in on Melissa Molano or Luci Christian, but I were to pick a newer or lesser known VA like most of the cast, I think Annie Wild would be a good choice too.",

Akasaka sure knows how to write funny characters, but I can\u2019t help but feel like this show could be so much more if everything didn\u2019t feel both like a caricature of the industry and something I was supposed to take as indicative of any semblance of reality. I also don\u2019t really know much of what comes next in the story, but having an hour and a half of preamble and setup at the expense of really endearing any of its characters to the audience is a rough start.\n\nI\u2019m sure this\u2019ll be fun, but it\u2019s far from the masterpiece everyone made it out to be",

I was impressed by how well the VAs did with their characters because, as I've been following the sub for a month and a half now, I was naturally going to compare the two in my mind. The only voice that felt a little too different from the original at times was Ai's, but she still gave a great performance, and of course this wouldn't be a factor to anyone starting with the dub. Overall, I'd say the quality about matches the sub.\n\nThis movie-length episode was still exciting and emotional even though I was watching it for the second time. Love the characters, and I'll definitely be following the sub and the dub going forward.",

Going in completely blind, I thought it was definitely an interesting story. I really didn't like the first half of the episode honestly, but the second half really picked up the slack. The episode overall was a bit predictable, but it did have a handful of twists that caught me way off guard.\n\n&gt;!I wasn't expecting Ai to end up dying right at the end. It was an extremely powerful scene, and Aqua and Ruby both went through so much in it. Aqua swearing to kill his own father is probably the most interesting part of the episode to me. Generally speaking, I'm not too big a fan of idols or music shows, but that aspect of the plot definitely has me hooked. I'll at least give the show another couple episodes before I decide if I'll drop it or not.!&lt;",

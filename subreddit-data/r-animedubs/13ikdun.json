Bad enough that they were assholes to their brother just because he was a chonky boy, but they made the bigbrained move to add on attempted kidnapping and assault.\n\nThe one chick screaming FOURTH FLOOR FOURTH FLOOR made me laugh for some reason.\n\nThe fantasy world princess sounds like the chick who pokes holes in condoms.",

I mean seriously the pacing is so off the parts that should have been kept in are cut and something new put in it's place or just not elaborated on! Yuuya was supposed to be on the bleachers with Kaede and Yukine when the ball comes at them Kaede is supposed to fall off the bleachers and Yuuya catches her but as his hands are full he martial arts kicks the ball into the goal! Not only that but the red ogres where there just to attack/hurt Koari and Yuuya not kidnap her! Oh and the little brother was supposed to get a monologue about his hatred for Yuuya and have a better reason to break down crying.",

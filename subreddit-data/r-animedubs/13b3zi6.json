As someone pointed out a few weeks ago, Ericht piloted the Lfrith. **Eri**cht + **L**frith. Eri-L. Aerial.\n\nAnd because of that, it's not Suletta who's some godly pilot who's immune to data storms, she's never even taking them on in the first place. All the burden is shifted onto Eri, who doesn't suffer ill effects because she's giant robot now.\n\nFrom what Sophie said before she kicked the bucket, it looks like the data storm calls out to you before you forever-sleep, and the voice is Eri's.\n\nLooks like the show is going to get more serious, finally.",

I'm leaning towards some type of clone.\n\nOr the tinfoil hat theory was that the body/facial reconstruction they use to make Elan Ceres doubles was used on some girl to turn her into not-Eri.",

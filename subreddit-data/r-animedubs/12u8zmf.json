Old or new, as long as it's dubbed we'd like to hear about it. \n\nAnything good we should look out for? Anything bad we should try to avoid? Tell us a little bit of what you think. It's nice if you elaborate a bit on what it is you like or don't like about a show. That way your comment is useful to people who are looking for new anime to watch. :)\n\nWriting the names of the anime in **bold** is nice, to make it easier for people skimming the thread to pick out the names.\n\nSince this is also for people who are looking for new shows to watch, please use the spoilertag if you reveal any mayor plot points of the anime you are discussing (see spoilertag section in the sidebar for info on how).\n\n\nTo prevent low effort comments to steal the spotlight from people who put in a little bit more effort **top level comments in this thread must be at least 150 characters long** (roughly 3 sentences long).\n\n\n[You can find a list of the previous \"Your week in anime dubs\" posts here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/search/?q=author%3AAutoModerator+AND+title%3AYour+week+in+anime+dubs&amp;sort=new)",

Then I powered through and she grew on me. \n\nAlso (just to be nitpicky, sorry), the voice pick for the old guild master guy in one of the episodes sounds more suitable in the dub compared to that in the sub (he sounds way younger than his age).\n\nOh yeah, after rewatching it in dub I got reminded of the order of the first two episodes. I actually forgot about that haha.",

I decided to bite the bullet on this one since I'm always fascinated by taboo romances like sibling love stories, and *Oreimo* is considered a classic in this field.\n\nHowever, I understand we aren't supposed to discuss non-dubbed shows on this subreddit, so I'll just say \"Kuroneko is a (fallen) angel\" and leave it at that.\n\nI've also been rewatching the first 7 episodes of ***Island*** as part of a community watch-along. With me already knowing all about the main mystery, it's interesting to see people come up with theories as to what the heck is going on ;). I really like that the show gives me good old VN adaptation vibes similar to studio Key works.",

            "comment": "Most of the anime I've been keeping up with lately don't have English dubs (but I definitely recommend Endo &amp; Kobayashi Live to any fantasy/romcom fans regardless), so the only one I started this week was **The Legend of Korra season 3**. It's an improvement on season 2 in almost every way - a strong main storyline, fantastic villains, and the character development is slowly getting back on track after the missteps of season 2. The fight scenes are some of the best in the series, and I really like the new characters too. &gt;!Also, the baby bison are adorable and wholesome just like Yuna's bears.!&lt;",

Season 3 has many of my favorite battle scenes, and seeing those again was really exciting (just watched the finale today). Seasons 1 &amp; 3 were the best for me, mainly because I'm not as interested in any of the plotlines involving the &gt;!spirit world.!&lt; \n\nI thought Tenzin was mostly fine, but this season did highlight even more than the first that he's not the best teacher of airbending, and now Meelo is following in his footsteps. \ud83d\ude02 &gt;!Throwing those poor airbenders into the obstacle courses with no prep of form or footwork, of course they're going to get beat up every time.!&lt;",

Having already seen Fate Zero, Unlimited Blade Works, Apocrypha, and Grand Order, I can see a few reasons why this one isn\u2019t as recommended especially with Unlimited Blade Works available.  Still a pretty good way to get more Fate though.  13 episodes in so far.",

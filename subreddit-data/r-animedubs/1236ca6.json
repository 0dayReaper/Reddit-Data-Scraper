Which I guess if you\u2019re standard is Demon Slayer than sure, but in the grand scheme of things no. The reason HxH works is because it isn\u2019t necessarily deep and is pretty easy to digest. It\u2019s just that any kind of competent storytelling is rare among modern Shounen and people want to feel superior while looking like fools to everyone else",

Obviously, back in the day, I started out watching stuff that was released in the 90s. But as I moved on throughout the years and got acquainted with newer series, I've found that I enjoy old ones less and less (pre-2010 sounds about right).\n\nAnd it's not just because of the visuals, but also because the whole flow and style of those older animes seems quite different from what we typically get nowadays.

            "comment": "**Recovery of an MMO Junkie**: Not really my thing but it was a sweet show with a neat gimmick. Two people meet while playing a video game. Romance and mild drama ensue.\n\n**Spice &amp; Wolf**: The romance isn't the main focus for the most part and it's a slow burn, but the chemistry between the two leads and the way their relationship develops is really lovely. Fantastic dub too.\n\n**Steins;Gate**: College-aged kids. Sci-fi about time travel in a modern setting. The romance is not the main focus, but the main relationship is believable and the chemistry between the two leads is fantastic.\n\n**Maison Ikkoku**: It's old and really long, but it's a Rumiko Takahashi classic with fantastic, relatable characters and a grounded college setting. It's clever and witty and just a lot of fun to watch.\n\n**Honey &amp; Clover**: Romance and drama with some good comedy bits. Characters are college-aged and dealing with really relatable issues. It can be a little melodramatic sometimes but it's nothing extreme.\n\nSpecial mentions:\n**Nana**: One of my personal favorites. Really great characters with fantastic chemistry. Plot wise, it's about two very different girls who meet on a train while they're moving to Tokyo, and they both end up living together while they pursue love and careers. They are both \"straight,\" but there is a lot of yuri subtext. It's just hard to recommend because it's not really a typical, happy romance and the ending is...well, it doesn't really have one. But if you're looking for relatable, mature themes, and a grounded story, give it a shot.\n\n**The Ice Guy and His Cool Female Colleague**: I haven't seen it, but it was airing last season and I've heard good things.\n\nAnother option is *Golden Time*, which a lot of people on this sub seem to enjoy, but personally it's one of the worst anime I've sat through in my life. Despite the college setting, the characters are incredibly childish. It was written by the same person who wrote Toradora, which somehow was more mature and nuanced despite taking place in a high school and having a main character whose primary trait was her childishness.\nMan...any excuse to rant about this show. But if you want a romcom with some drama and your minimum requirement is that the characters aren't in high school, maybe add it to your list? Honestly there aren't many that fit that criteria, and this one does have romance as its main focus.",

It\u2019s great",

And the romance in my opinion is just as important in both. Aquarion is a little bit of a slow burn though.\n\nI saw Ride Your Wave mentioned and it is really good. You\u2019ll just need to be sure to have tissues on hand when watching the movie. Also, if you haven\u2019t watched them yet, several Miyazaki movies have romance: Howl\u2019s Moving Castle, Princess Mononoke, The Wind Rises to name a few.\n\nRurouni Kenshin, Spy x Family, Emma: A Victorian Romance, Ah! My Goddess (there is some fan service), and Yona of the Dawn. Then there\u2019s also some yaoi romance anime: Junjo Romantica, Given, and Yuri!!! on Ice.",

Genre-wise it's a mash-up of literally everything but there is some great chemistry/romantic dynamics in there. It took me a while to check it out because I usually watch darker stuff, but it hooked me pretty quick, definitely deserving of its hype.",

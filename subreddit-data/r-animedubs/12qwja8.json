Assuming, of course, you like ecchi (though I'd generally call it lighter ecchi compared to shows like Highschool DxD) slice of life comedy with slapstick elements. It never *really* takes itself too seriously, which is good. The English dub is really solid. I recommend watching it uncensored, because there are *plenty* of obscene jokes that I've always found just hit harder when they're not bleeped out.",

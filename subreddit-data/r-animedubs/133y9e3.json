    "postText": "I'm glad CR added Best Dub Performance to the Anime Awards but something's been bugging with the shows that get nominated or rather the shows that don't. Now I think we can agree that Hero Aca, AOT, and JoJo have some of the best ongoing dubs currently but none of these shows have gotten a single nomination for this category which I find incredibly bizarre. It started in 2019 we had the Part 4 dub which is one of my all time favorite dubs Bangzoom did such an incredible job with it with it with an All-star cast where everyone was in G.O.D. MODE especially DC Douglas, Matthew, and Zach yet not a single one of them got nominated. \n\nThen there was AOT J Micheal Tatum, Bryce, Justin Briner, Jessie, Matthew, and Chris Hury narration for Grisha's backstory was next level once again nothing. Then there was Hero Aca with  Ricco, Kellen Geoff, and Emily Neves who were all the MVPs of the S4 dub again not a single nomination. Like how could to any of these people's performances and tell not a single one of them deserved a nomination instead they nominated the most random ass shows that nobody watched its like for this category they suddenly turn into the Oscars where if your too popular or super heroes fuck you. Now I'm sure the people who were nominated all gave great performances but there's no way they couldn't switch out of them for one of the people I mentioned at first I thought maybe DIU was disqualified because it was a dub of an show from 2016 but the very next year they had no problem nominated Casey for the Netflix dub understandable so I might add he was easily the MVP of the Netflix dub. Then in 2020 we had Golden Wind once again how could you listen to Ray Chase and Kellen Geoff and not nominated either of them. It was the most egregious in 2021 where the nominated the VAs for Eren and Tanjiro in every language but English WHY?! Like is CR trying to throw shade at Bryce and Zach or something? They both were amazing especially Zach his performance during Tanjiro speech after he throws his sword at Akaza was phenomenal. Then this year with Part 6 I don't know how you could listen to Kira and Yong and not nominate one of them. \n\nBut the one thing thats even more bizarre than none of these great dubs not getting a single nomination for like 4 years straight is what all these dubs share in common all of them either debut on Toonami or aired on Toonami its like Toonami serves as the kiss of death for these shows for some reason like is there some beef between CR and Toonami before Sony that I'm unaware of? They have gotten better with the nominations by actually nominating shows people actually watched although I personally wouldn't have nominated Natalie I just thought that Alex and Megan's performances were stronger imo although Barry Yandell is the one who should've gotten nominated for SPYxFAMILY his elegance stole the show every time. Does anyone else feel this way or it just me cause this shit has bugged the hell out of me for years.",

            "comment": "Award shows are just popularity contests, and popularity contrasts of any kind are always bullshit. These particular awards were made by Crunchyroll pre-Funimation acquisition, and Crunchyroll seemed to always be reluctant to make or embrace dubs. So for all we know, the reason the big performances from popular shows is because the people making the nomination lists are sub fans and don't watch the big shows in dub to ever hear them.\n\nPlus, when you think about it, it's kinda weird that Crunchyroll (now post-Funimation acquisition) even does the awards. They make and distribute the overwhelming majority of all the dubs that come out these days. They will always have a bias to nominate more of the shows they distribute as a means of advertising their various licenses they own regardless of if the shows are actually deserving of whatever accolades they're being nominated for. Whether their shows win or not is meaningless as long as it brings more people to their app and website along the way.\n\nAt the end of the day, the best thing would be for everyone to stop voting and paying attention to the awards every year, because Crunchyroll would see it as an effort with no returns and stop doing them.",

Honestly so much of their nominations are built out of popularity rather than quality.\n\nCouldn't take them seriously after nominating Crispin Freeman's performance in Fate/GO Babylonia over any of the actual main actors (especially Marin Miller who I thought was the standout of that dub), for a role that while important, was only in a handful of episodes over the course of the show rather than being a constant presence of the story.",

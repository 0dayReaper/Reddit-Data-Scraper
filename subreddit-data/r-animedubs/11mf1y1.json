Another thing, the Boruto dub releases are inconsistent as hell. We don\u2019t know when the next batch of episodes are coming. Like I get that the dub has to be a year behind the Japanese, but this is too much. If the dub was weekly, we would\u2019ve been at least on that Chunin Exams Filler Arc right now. The wait is ridiculous.",

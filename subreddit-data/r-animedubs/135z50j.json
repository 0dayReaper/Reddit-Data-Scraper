It\u2019s hard to confirm if any ongoing dubs have writers who are members of the WGA, but it\u2019s ridiculous how many people are acting like there\u2019s zero chance of a connection based on a limited understanding of the industry. We might see some dubs shut down in a couple weeks once they run out of scripts to do VA work for. It\u2019s a distinct possibility, especially if the strike is long. \n\nVA unions have been relatively powerless, so that\u2019s probably what people are thinking about, but writer\u2019s unions are much stronger and longer established. Of course, that doesn\u2019t necessarily extend to anime dubs, and dub script writing is often done by primarily VAs rather than Hollywood screen writers. Only time will tell.",

Crunchyroll is Sony owned. Sony has to deal with the WGA for movie production. Unions are reinforced by solidarity. VAs don\u2019t have solidarity because the industry isn\u2019t as long established nor as highly paid. So they lack negotiating power. The WGA is powerful because a vast majority of people in the profession join. The WGA even boycotts productions that employ non-members. That\u2019s the problem with anime dub unions. No need for union-busting scabs when lots of VAs are freelance and non-union. \n\nWith most dubs, the script writers are VAs who\u2019ve taken up ADR duties, so they\u2019re probably not WGA-affiliated because the WGA won\u2019t view them as qualified members maybe. But the possibility exists for contracted studios to employ WGA members for script writing and that\u2019d halt ongoing work, since studios are often independent from licensors. I personally think it\u2019ll be business as usual for the most part, but there could be a couple random stoppages with outsourced dubs. Just something to keep in mind over the next couple weeks, since ADR script writing is usually one of the first things done for episodes. All it\u2019d take is someone who\u2019s a WGA member that typically does Hollywood screen writing and happens to be working on an anime dub.",

It\u2019s an organized effort to renegotiate a set of individual contracts over concerns primarily about streaming and AI. It just happens to be focused in network television because pretty much every writer is unionized and the issues are most pronounced in the TV format.\n\nAll it\u2019d take for Sony/Crunchyroll, or any anime streaming service, to be involved is for a dub studio to employ a WGA member, the WGA to make similar renegotiation demands over such concerns on behalf of said member(s), and the studio and/or streaming service to refuse to meet those demands. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very likely, if at all, because unionization is fairly weak in dub production. Not to mention that anyone involved in dub production isn\u2019t solely in the script writing profession, they\u2019re often handymen that do a little bit of all the jobs. The WGA may not view that as qualifying for membership. \n\nBut the potential still exists for a scenario to occur that gets roped into the ongoing WGA strike. Because ADR script writing fits what WGA members do and it\u2019s a similar entertainment medium.",

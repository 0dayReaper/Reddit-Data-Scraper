    "postText": "Welcome to Version 12 of the Megathread!\n\nThere tends to be a decent amount of threads that either asks if/when an anime is going to be dubbed, or where a dub can be streamed/bought.\n\n[Comprehensive Dub Calendar](https://teamup.com/ksdhpfjcouprnauwda) by [/u/jamiex304](https://www.reddit.com/u/jamiex304/)\n\nWe've added a rule and automod code to restrict topics where users ask any of the following:\n\n1. If any anime that currently doesn't have a dub announced will get one.\n2. Asking for the date/timeframe of when an announced dub will be released.\n3. Asking where a show that's already dubbed can be watched.\n\nYou are only allowed to ask such questions in this thread. You\u2019ll normally get a very quick response from someone in the community.\n\n**Current Dub Season - Spring 2023**\n\nSPRING 2023 CR DUB LINEUP:\n\n* A Galaxy Next Door\n* Dr. STONE New World\n* Dead Mount Death Play\n* Demon Slayer: Swordsmith Village Arc\n* Golden Kamuy Season 4\n* Hell's Paradise\n* I Got a Cheat Skill in Another World and Became Unrivaled in the Real World\n* In Another World With My Smartphone 2\n* In/Spectre Season 2\n* KamiKatsu: Working for God in a Godless World\n* KONOSUBA - An Explosion on this Wonderful World!\n* Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear - Punch!\n* MASHLE: MAGIC AND MUSCLES\n* Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury Season 2\n* My Clueless First Friend\n* My Home Hero\n* Ranking of Kings: Treasure Chest of Courage\n* Sacrificial Princess and the King of Beasts\n* The Ancient Magus' Bride Season 2\n* The Aristocrat\u2019s Otherworldly Adventure: Serving Gods Who Go Too Far\n* The Legendary Hero Is Dead!\n* TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You Season 2\n* Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke's Mansion\n\n[SUMMER 2023 Licenses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-nqtjMi44S3y9TwuRwe6QFer672cg8wkBn0DWfAyXgk/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**List of shows you can currently legally stream and where by** [/u/KillerPayback](https://www.reddit.com/u/KillerPayback/)\n\n*Spreadsheet version*\n\n* [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I-voQuSTm4RJdBTSwVq8A-2YIIIDmMW-Gp6cYDhX7TI/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I-voQuSTm4RJdBTSwVq8A-2YIIIDmMW-Gp6cYDhX7TI/edit#gid=0)\n\n*Document version*\n\n* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JR7RVRX3qamFuw6QqBftngWk7lTRmQTyL2bs\\_FwQrMY/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JR7RVRX3qamFuw6QqBftngWk7lTRmQTyL2bs_FwQrMY/edit)\n\n**List of upcoming announced dubs (including future simuldubs)** **by** [/u/Kenny\\_Stryker](https://www.reddit.com/u/Kenny_Stryker/)\n\n* [https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1692966](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1692966)\n\n[You can find more info here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/comments/lz8rus/announcement_comprehensive_anime_dubs_release/)\n\n**Titles currently picked up by Amazon**\n\nAs some people may know, Amazon has a reputation for picking up shows and not dubbing them, when almost any other company would at least consider it. They also don't do physical releases. That said, they haven't picked up a new anime series since 2020, and as of August 2021, are willing to actually release a new dub, starting with a redub of the first 3 Rebuild of Evangelion movies in addition to having the first dub(s) of Evangelion 3.0+1.0.\n\n[List of Amazon Licenses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nQyJNCZRISU-hOR7W4-XqpaDQe4Eu2YaN16l4TRVEmY/edit)\n\n**FAQs**\n\n1.) What is the status of simuldubs, dubcasts, and other weekly dub releases due to Corona/COVID-19?\n\n* Dubs are back to weekly releases. Delays will still happen but safe to assume episodes will continue to air unless told otherwise.\n\n2.) When will the next set of One Piece episodes come out?\n\n* Each new batch of episodes tends to be released on places like Microsoft store at least a few weeks before getting on Funimation's streaming service.\n* The latest batch:\n* Next Batch: TBA\n\n3.) \\_\\_\\_ Movie dub?\n\n* Movies in general are harder to license and release than TV shows. If movie dubs do get announced, don't expect them for quite a while. Especially for physical releases.\n\n[**Archive for stickied topics for users to Ask Where or When an Anime is/will be dubbed**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/wiki/wheretowatchanimetopicarchive)",

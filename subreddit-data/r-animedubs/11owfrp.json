Senpai, my man!\n\nYeah, def liked this episode, though it may or may not be my bias toward combatant anime girls. And a tip senpai: you NEVER comment a woman's age, or her weight.\n\nAnd interestingly enough, I'm also watching a \"anime girls do judo\" show on HiDive called Ippon Again, so with the focus on the tournament coming, I'm excited to get a little more anime judo intake.",

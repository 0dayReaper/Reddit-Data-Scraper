We\u2019ll see what happens if the strike is put into effect. [It *might* effect dubs](https://twitter.com/shelby_young/status/1666115720873394178?s=46&amp;t=tcMTzkwifnqQt6rCHNRarw), as I assume they fall under the Television/Theatrical/New Media that\u2019s why commercials and video games would not be included in this strike but I\u2019m not sure if dubbing is included in that or have their own separate contract.",

Zom 100, a Viz Media title, is already in the SAG database as well.\n\nSo in other words, no.",

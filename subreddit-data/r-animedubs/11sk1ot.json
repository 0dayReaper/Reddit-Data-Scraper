Here's I'd pick:\n\nSuzume Iwato - Madeline Brewer\n\n\nSouta - Oscar Isaac\n\n\nTamaki Iwato - Katee Sackhoff\n\n\nDaijin - Cassandra Lee Morris \n\n\nSerizawa - Matt Lanter\n\n\nTsubame Iwato (Suzume's mom) - Yvonne Stahovski\n\n\nChika Amabe - Amalee\n\n\nRumi (Bar Owner and Single mom that Suzume meets) - Jameela Jamil \n\n\nHitsujir\u014d Munakata - Patrick Seitz",

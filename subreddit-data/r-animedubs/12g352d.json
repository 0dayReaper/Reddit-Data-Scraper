None of the episodes appeared in the \u201crecently added\u201d section, and they all defaulted to Japanese simulcast when starting an episode. Additionally, the English audio sounded weird, as it was all only coming through one of my speakers, and upon finishing an episode, the app wouldn\u2019t acknowledge that I had even watched it.",

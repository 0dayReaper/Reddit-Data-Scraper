If so, what's the reason?\n\nAnd the fact that he's been gone off-grid from social media since the accusation makes me wanna assume his VO career is over even when he sticks around until the end of this season, right?",

They'll allow him to keep playing Thorfinn and when the show's Done, Goodbye Mike.",

I think he was allowed to finish his role as Thorfinn, and when the show is over, goodbye to him. We'll certainly not see his name appear ever again in future projects.",

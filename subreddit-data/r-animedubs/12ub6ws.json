In the final moments of their epic confrontation, the corpse god's final gambit shot was wholly unexpected -- reincarnation magic! Across space and time, a boy named Polka Shinoyama awakens feeling...not quite himself...... Who could've expected that the climactic battle between good and evil would turn out like this??\n\nCast\n\n* Polka voiced by Morgan Berry\n* Misaki voiced by Bree Han\n* Takumi voiced by Brandon Acosta\n* Shagrua voiced by Gerard Caster\n* Recuria voiced by Jenn Alyx \n* Corpse God voiced by William Ofoegbu \n* Arase voiced by Derick Snow\n* Iwanome voiced by Jason Douglas\n \nCrew\n\n* ADR Director: Jason Lord\n* ADR Engineer: Ian Emerson\n* Mixer: Matt Grounds\n* ADR Script: Ben Phillips\n\n[Source](https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2023/04/21/dead-mount-death-play-english-dub-reveals-cast-crew-release-date)",

He\u2019s going to knock this out of the park.\n\nEveryone else is fairly new from the research I did.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen this show I HIGHLY RECOMMEND checking this one out. The manga is written by the same author as Baccano and Durarara. It\u2019s well written with a very grounded understanding of magic and one of the most entertaining antagonists you\u2019ll find.",

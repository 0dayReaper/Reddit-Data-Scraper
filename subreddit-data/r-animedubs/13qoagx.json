However, when the show is over, so is his career, goodbye to him. This is his final role for sure. He's been radio silent from social media, which only means he'll be out of this industry soon enough and you won't ever see his name again appear in voice acting projects.\n\nThere was also another VA in the show who was outed as a rapist and was quickly but quietly fired and recast. I think action was taken by CR quicker because DiMascio's situation was worse.",

In fact, we thought they did fire him back when Haimoto didn't voice Thorfinn in episode 6 iirc. But he came back. Even if it was for contractual reasons, that didn't really stop CR from kicking out Anthony DiMascio the moment the allegations against him dropped. Point is, CR had the option to get rid of him immediately but for whatever reason decided not to.\n\nPlus, if they were planning on firing him anyway, it doesn't really make much sense for CR to continue to allow him to voice Thorfinn till the end of the season only to have to go back and spend the time, effort, money and resources to redub the whole thing again.\n\nNow S3 would be an interesting situation. CR might, like you said, replace him with a new VA but they could also allow him to reprise his existing roles (while blacklisting him from any future ones) especially since the current outrage against him is likely to die down by the time S3 comes out. The first possibility is likelier but the fact that he continues to play Thorfinn despite everything is why I'm not completely ruling out the second one.",

            "comment": "I could see two possible scenarios:\n\n1. Aleks Le solely assumes the role of Thorfinn in both dubs going forward if another season is announced.\n2. Another Texas VA taking over as Thorfinn if the next season is licensed by CR or Sentai. I think the best candidate to be the new Thorfinn would be Austin Tindle.",

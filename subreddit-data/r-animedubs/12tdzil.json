Even though it's actually not super special compared to some of the proper fantasy stuff you get, I guess, I just really love that folk magic sort of take on it. Idk, it's just refreshing. You don't see it very often. Though I suppose this season will be focusing more on alchemy in a high tech environment with the college? I'll miss the \"folk magic in the English countryside\" vibe of Season 1, but I'm still very excited and I'm sure I'll love it.",

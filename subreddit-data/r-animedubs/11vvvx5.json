            "comment": "I've been hoping we would get an episode focused on Eliaria. It's easily one of my favorites from season 2. The introductions of the new characters were a bit of an infodump, but they all have likeable and distinct personalities - which was one of the issues I had with the growing cast on Ryouma's end, that they were starting to feel too similar. The conflict was simple but did a good job of showing the social situation at Eliaria's school. \n\nThose noble girls being shocked that there were no toilets or bathtubs in the forest. \ud83d\ude02 By the way, how did they make that outhouse? I must have missed it.",

If they can do full earth magic construction, then Ryouma has created something very powerful indeed. \n\nOutHouse slime would be hilarious but maybe not impossible considering their evolutionary traits and their first jobs back in season 1...",

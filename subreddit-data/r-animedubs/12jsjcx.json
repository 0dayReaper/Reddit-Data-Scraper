How about TWO swimsuit segments in Urusei Yatsura!\n\nI'm happy for the water Yokai, at the end of the episode, he found himself a home and someone to take care of him. And all the Urusei Yatsura antics, hilarity, romance, and near-death experiences in between.",

            "comment": "Just started watching this today and I'm having such a blast! It's so unapologetically classic, right down to maintaining the somewhat retro art style. The over the top slapstick, constant misunderstandings, super horny MC. It reminds me so much of shows like Ranma 1/2 and especially To Love Ru which is basically the exact same concept (though I guess Urusei Yatsura came first by about 20 years). It reminds me of when I first started watching anime when I was 12, around 2010, binging Inuyasha and Ranma 1/2 in the summer with a root beer float or some watermelon.\n\nAnyone here see the 1980s original? I'm curious how accurate and faithful it is on a scene-by-scene or general picture kinda basis. I guess I missed the announcements back when it was first released, but have they said how much of it they're dubbing? Because it looks like the original is almost 200 episodes.",

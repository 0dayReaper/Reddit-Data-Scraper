I'm sure it's (in part) just a frequency thing, you hear someone voice a character for 200+ episodes, some associations are definitely going to form there. It also almost forces the VA to go through a full range of slight variations due to the character's emotional state, as well as gimicky things like loss of emotions, evil clones, etc.\n\nLucy isn't the first role nor the best that Cherami has voiced, but for me, it will always be the most iconic.",

Love to see Madeline Morris on scripts here - loved her work on Beastars S2 and thought she improved upon S1.\n\nEspecially excited with that cast list - I\u2019ve really been missing super mixed casts like this so honestly gonna check it out solely based on that.",

Was  thinking Disney didn\u2019t learn their lesson after what happened with Summertime Rendering but seeing the director of this dub gives me a lot of faith that Dubbing Bros will actually do a decent job on it.

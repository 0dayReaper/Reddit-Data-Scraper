    "postText": "Like the title says, how much does the cast of a dub affect whether you watch it or not?\n\nFor me, it depends. Usually, I'll read a show's synopsis and see if it looks interesting. If it's one that I think just seems kinda, eh, I'll wait and see who's doing the VA. If it's a VA I really like I'll probably check out at least the first episode or two. If it's one I'm not fond of, I'll pass.\n\nThat's how I ended up watching \"Kid From The Last Dungeon Boonies.\"\"\" I saw that there were a few VAs I really like, so I gave it a shot. And I'm glad I did. That show was hilarious.",

Thinking about it now it might have been the same for A Lull in the Sea and K-On!, but I can\u2019t quite remember right now.\n\nThe other time was Yamada-kin and the Seven Witches.

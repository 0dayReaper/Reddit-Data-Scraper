From what people say, this arc (Red Light District) is one of the best in the entire manga, so hyped!\n\nIt\u2019ll 100% be dubbed, but it\u2019ll probably be stuck in Toonami Jail when it does.",

It's a complete reversal of how the industry treated anime movies before 2016.\n\nOne thing was responsible for this enormous sea change in the anime industry: ***Your Name.***\n\nThat movie had such phenomenal success that it caused the entire anime industry to really treat anime movies as core productions instead of just throwaway extras like they had before 2016.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding. Here are some of the big name anime movies that have been canon in the past 4 years (these are related to franchises, not standalone titles):\n\n- Sword Art Online: Ordinal Scale\n\n- The Irregular at Magic High School The Movie: The Girl Who Calls the Stars\n\n- The Saga of Tanya the Evil: The Movie\n\n- No Game No Life Zero\n\n- Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya: Oath Under the Snow\n\n- Code Geass: Lelouch of the Resurrection\n\n- Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato\n\n- Liz and the Blue Bird\n\n- Non Non Biyori: Vacation\n\n- Sound Euphonium: Brand New Day\n\n- Goblin Slayer: Goblin's Crown\n\n- Violet Evergarden: The Movie\n\n- Made in Abyss: Dawn of the Deep Soul",

Season 4 will be a long one, because it's about as long as everything used for season 1. Meanwhile the short final arc, would make for a great movie. If a random middle arc made for a super profitable movie, then the finale as a movie, should break even more records.",

I would have guessed a Winter 2022 release at the earliest, but glad to see I'm wrong. Since there is no season attached to the air date, I'm going to assume a Fall release and most other 2021 anime have confirmed if they're airing in the Summer or not.",

I guess that TPN S2 this season will probably receives both a simuldub and aired on Toonami at the same time since The Irregular at Magic High School S2 simuldub was done and also Dr. Stone S2 to be announced on Toonami later this month.",

    "postText": "Some may get a nostalgia boost after seeing this name...After all, it was made by Toonami Jetstream. However, given Toonami Jetstream's shutdown, the dub was cancelled after just 5 episodes. I'm thankful for the dubbed episodes we got, but I'm still sad that we never got more. \n\nIts based off a manga by Dr. Stone's author &amp; One Punch Man's illustrator...before each of these series existed. \n\nThe 2000s anime is of its time, particularly in the animation &amp; the English opening. The casting was full of iconic VAs (Yuri Lowenthal, Derek Stephen Prince, Crispin Freeman, etc.) I thought it was alright for what it was. There was potential here.\n\nMaybe if a blue moon happens, then it'll get a reboot and we'll see it dubbed in full.",

Macy, in my opinion, has more of a sing-songy skipping quality to her voice that, at this point, I can best describe as sounding like she's always got a smile when she's speaking. I got that vibe from Rebecca in Iceblade, Shiori in More Than a Married Couple, and now here as Miu. \n\nI think she might also sound a little deeper in a typical role.",

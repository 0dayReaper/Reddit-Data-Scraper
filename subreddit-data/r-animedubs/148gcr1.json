The only person that\u2019s been in my head is Erika Harlacher but that\u2019s mostly because she\u2019s shared roles with Yamatos Japanese Va a few times in the past lol. There\u2019s next to no shot Erika is gonna get the role though, so I\u2019m just putting my hands up in the air \n\nLindsay Sheppard or Seidel are the only two Texas VA I can think of that I would immediately like lol",

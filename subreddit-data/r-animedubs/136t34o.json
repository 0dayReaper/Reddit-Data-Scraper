            "comment": "The mothers segment was fun and a lot of laughs (and I think I'm hearing Ian Sinclair as the Butler). \n\nI had a feeling that with all of Ataru's unappreciation of Lum for the past 10 eps, this show was gonna do a segment with lum leaving his ass (even for a little bit). I'm sure Ataru's gonna go back to being his degenerative self again, and Lum is gonna be electrocuting his ass again. But I still liked it. It felt somewhat different from the chasing hijinks these two go through on a weekly.\n\nSide note, def laughed the hardest with the \"cutting grass\" line of the show.",

It looks they're opting to credit the cast of the show on the dub announcement page rather than the episodes themselves.",

Especially the back half (Since Your Parting) - obviously the show is very consistently zany and whacky so when we started working on this one it was immediately clear that we were doing something different and it feels very appropriate. Even the lighting in the animation is dimmer and there's a kind of darkness washing over every scene as opposed to the super bright and saturated light present in the rest of the show, almost like when Lum leaves she takes a lot of the light in the world with her. \n\nAlso lots of fun Mendo gags which I hope you all enjoyed :) I particularly enjoyed Mendo confronting Ataru with the theory that Lum dumped him - Nathan (voice of Ataru) really brought out a lot of scared vulnerability there and I think it played super well against Mendo's smarmy-ness.\n\nHope you're all enjoying each week! We've got even more cool stuff for you coming down the pipeline :)",

I ended up watching The First Kiss subbed, and it came out fine due to the heavier romance focus. But I generally prefer watching Love is War dub because it has better comedic delivery (no subtitles to spoi the punchline a second early), and the announcer in the dub takes on a more sarcastic tone than the Japanese's serious narrator.",

The confession arc explains how the two leads complement each other and why both of them are infatuated with the other. &gt;!Shirogane sees Kaguya as fearless and someone who isn't afraid to act at a moment's notice, by saving a drowning girl. And Kaguya loves Shirogane for his genuine kindness; she loathes herself for being so calculating and an ice queen. Plus, that confession finally redeemed the series for its slow romantic progression in my eyes.!&lt; \n\nBut I do agree that *Kaguya-sama* is a slow romance. It's on the likes of those other manga romances like *Rent* or *Nisekoi* (subbed) in that the romantic progression is delayed repeatedly. *Kaguya-sama* is no *Clannad* or *Toradora* when it comes to romantic development.",

Just agree that it's a slow subtle one that doesn't have the great pay offs that some others you mentioned and i love have. Only issue I had with it, and it got to the point where I just didn't care about their romance and was more invested in the side characters, like their treasurer is my favorite character.\n\nIdk why kaguya fans seem to get so up in arms at even suggesting that one aspect of it is not quite as good as other romance anime.",

Rascal is more of a harem then a direct romance story between the 2 leads.\n\nAnd considering 90% of romance anime end at the confession the story of Kaguya goes much further.

As for fruits basket Ive never seen it or read it yet though its on my to watch/read eventually list.\n\nBut as for rascal... thats actually the first time ive ever heard anyone say its a harem and no real romance... your opinion is absolutely making me want to go watch the anime now just to see how much they apparently fucked it up haha. Im basing my opinion off the light novels and though there is the petite devil kohai who also happens to fall in love with the mc in book 2.. in no way is it even slightly reciprocated nor is it ever brought up again in any future novels.\n\nBut he and mai have certainly kissed many many times and discuss their future and are absolutely in love with eachother. Though i will admit the point of the books arnt exactly about their love story so their love isnt the main topic in anyway, which ofcourse thats entirely what kaguya sama is about. So i guess i can see where youre coming from.\n\nStill ill have to watch the anime now to see how on earth anyone gets the idea of bunny girl being a harem lmao.",

Using fantasy to help with different hard to talk about real life adolescent problems in a way that could actually help people who irl have those issues or relate in some way.\n\nThough in 10 books its only been 6 girls. Only 3 of which had love interest in him. Which later became only 2, and really only 1 since the kohai was brought up and ended with book 2 and the 1 being is gf and the other one turning back into a middle schooler.  But i definitely see your point.\n\nKaguya sama is only a love story. Bunny and mono just happen to have love involved",

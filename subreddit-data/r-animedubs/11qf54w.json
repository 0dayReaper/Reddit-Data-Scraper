So happy it's already been renewed.\n\nI like how Alpha isn't just a lacky, she pretty much does whatever she wants and randomly gives deference to Shadow and asks for his help when needed.\n\nAnd he *still* doesn't believe the descendant of the hero story he made up which turned out to be true lmfao.",

The irony that he just bullshitted/invented a fairy tail about Alpha's origins using a random book in his storage shed and it turns out to not only be true, but leads to him inadvertently setting himself up to clash with the cult of Diablos who are trying to resurrect the Demon King is top tier.",

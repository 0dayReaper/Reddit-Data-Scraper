I think Usui doesn't want to visit revenge on another victim, but his honor demands that Raizo dies. Methinks Usui will point Raizo towards some goal, and Raizo, knowing full well it's a suicide mission, will do it anyway. Raizo gets closure in death, and Usui keeps the Revenger code. That's about an Urobutcher ending as I can imagine.\n\nProps to sniper guy's urban ghillie suit.",

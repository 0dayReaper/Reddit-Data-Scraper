He just comes up short in emotional scenes. It makes the main character kinda hard to empathize with. In classic Ayres fashion with these kind of characters, his character comes off less as \"I'm struggling and can't figure things out, maybe I need to have an introspective moment and improve myself\" and more \"Woe is me, why is life so unfair?\", &gt;!even though his character expressly acknowledges he needs to be more the former than the latter, and actually acts on it!&lt;. Kinda similar to everytime he gets the MC role, he just ruins any empathy I might feel for his characters.\n\nThat being said, I think he's doing a great job when his character is being the exasperated straight man in a house full of loons. So, I wouldn't let it put you off much. My roommate says his voice just bothers me way too much, and that I'm too sensitive to whiny characters/voices in general, so hopefully I'm just being overly critical here.",

Often if I hear that voice in non-comedic roles, it takes me out of the show a bit, like with Log Horizon for example. Sakurasou is one of my favorite shows, and I hoped they would have gone with a softer voice for the role since Sorata is a pretty down-to-earth (well, in the context of a house of loons), so the voice should match. I imagine comedic moments with Mashiro have to be great! \n\nI won\u2019t complain too much since I never thought this would ever get a dub at all!",

It was just the few times where he tried to be serious/sad that really made me want to stop watching it. I watched like 20+ episodes I think, I dropped when he traveled to heaven, there were a few scenes where he tried to be emotional and I just couldn't handle how much of a pity party his character sounded like he was throwing for himself. I know it's weird and I feel kinda like a dick for being overly critical of Ayers' performances, but something about the way he voices characters when they're sad and you're supposed to empathize with them, always makes me feel like he's voicing a whiny preteen kid at the tail end of throwing a tantrum. It always makes me kinda root against those characters, which I know isn't the intention and really pulls me out of the story.\n\nI'll prolly give **Heaven's Lost Property** another go at some point, now that I know what to expect. I'm pretty sure it won't bother me as much the second time around (at least that's how I was able to get through **Deadman Wonderland**).",

It's not actually a movie, it's out of order animated scenes from the canceled 3rd season with bits of the ending.\n\nI'd recommend people watch the anime, then the first movie and finish the series with the manga. Ignoring the 2nd movie until you finish the manga, if you want to see it, because it will spoil you immediately, the clips are out of order, you can't really opt out to not see the ending if you start the 2nd movie.\n\nIn any case, Heaven's Lost Property i enjoyed a lot and found it to be very profound, assuming you consumed the entire series, the first half is too harem comedy.",

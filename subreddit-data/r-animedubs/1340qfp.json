            "comment": "This show is good. For someone whose only real experience is reading mystery novels, Tetsuo is amazingly quick on his feet. He was able to plan that far ahead and modify his story. I'm sure when  Kyoichi found him in the apartment dressed up as a cleaning bro he hadn't come up with the idea to make him a PI, but he smoothly integrated that part into the cover story.\n\nThis also confirms Kasen is best waifu. Not only does she implicitly trust her husband, she's also collected enough to act freaked out while internally maintaining her composure.",

On top of this being a nerve-racking thriller, you get to hear some really good voice acting, especially that from Aaron Roberts and Morgan Laure during their characters\u2019 interrogation. \n\nReally do think that Tetsuo is digging himself more into a deeper hole the longer this draws out. But i guess its better than the alternative of getting shanked by Kyoichi.",

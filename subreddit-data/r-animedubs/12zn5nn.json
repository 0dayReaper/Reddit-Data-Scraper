    "postText": "**Synopsis from MyAnimeList:**\n\n&gt;On the brink of extinction, mankind has downsized and now solely resides in the city-state of Flandore, living in cities encased by glass domes. Beyond the domes exist vicious lycanthropes who thrive in the darkness; among the citizens inside, a clear distinction between the nobility and commoners is in place. The blood of nobles enables them to utilize mana, granting them abilities that exceed human limits and greatly assist them in defeating lycanthropes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Already 13 years of age, noble Melida Angel has yet to manifest her mana, and attends an elite academy where she is mistreated for her lack thereof. In order to help her, Kufa Vampir is ordered by the Angel family to become Melida's tutor. While Kufa seems to be a mere mentor, an ulterior motive lurks behind his job\u2014he is to assassinate her if he confirms that she does not possess mana.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Kufa's investigation eventually leads him to determine he must eliminate Melida. However, Kufa is struck by her unwavering determination, spirit, and belief in herself when he witnesses her in a fight, choosing instead to offer a way she can manifest her magic. As Melida learns to use mana with the help of Kufa's teachings, Kufa forsakes his mission and jeopardizes everything to keep his discovery of Melida unknown to the Angel family and his own guild. However, both Kufa and Melida will soon realize that hiding their secret will not be the only challenge they face, as unforeseen trouble is waiting just around the corner. \n\n[Previous Anime Dub Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/search/?q=author%3AAutoModerator%20AND%20title%3AAnime%20Dub%20Discussion%20-&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sr_nsfw=)",

            "comment": "My opinion on this anime....\n\nThe good:  Awesome awesome awesome OP.  (Share the Light).  Concept itself is pretty cool.  And I like the world they designed overall.  I also like the art style.  VA'a in this did an excellent job.  Brittany Karbowski knocked it out of the park. \n\nThe bad: The show itself is just... Not very memorable.  It's very generic.  Nothing about it particularly stands out as far as the plot/direction the show goes.  It's very \"one and done\" and feels dragged out at times.  I feel like the execution was not as good as it could be.  Oh.  And there are some romantic undertones that definitely cross into the \"creepy\" range at times due to the ages of the characters.  \n\nI rated this show a 7.  Which is the grade I give to shows that were solid or fun.  But nothing special or amazing.  Something that I'd probably watch a second season of.  But won't lose sleep over it if it never comes. It has a 5.93 on MAL.  Meaning I was more generous about this anime than most. \n\nAs an aside... My avatar on MAL is the main male character from this show.  Go figure. Haha.",

            "comment": "An indulgent show that gets so bad that it becomes funny bad. The way Kirito-wannabe teacher Kufa Vampir falls for powerless underdog student Melida is hilarious. So many random story elements, from vampires to Alice in Wonderland, are blended together in the oddest ways. The plot is so ridiculous that the show becomes an accidental parody. \n\nThe series starts off mildly entertaining, but as it nears its midway point, the quality deteriorates. The animation drops from tolerable to unwatchable, and some scenes are stitched improperly, leading to a confounding viewing experience. In episode 7 iirc, the main crew magically teleport from a school in one scene to a train in the next. At points, the sheer badness becomes comedic. In one instance, a villain gets his torso clawed, and the studio animates a swiping effect on his torso to illustrate the attack; however, once the effect dissapears, there are no scars or battle damage. This leads to a hilarious juxtaposition where the guy screams out in pain yet looks perfectly fine. In addition, the plot twists in the show are absurd; there's enjoyment to be had in the parts of the story that the viewer doesn't eyeroll over. Would I recommend this show? No. Is it funny-bad? Kind of.\n\nAs for the dub, the main character voices are solid, but I found some of the minor character voices wanting. An okay dub.",

If its faithful to the novels, which I feel is highly likely, season 2 happens about a month 6 weeks max after the end of season 1 so it's not a big jump. That being said there should be a 1 year time skip after this arc though, so I'd be very surprised if Madeleine stays, since Rudeus's really entering his teenage years in this season so I'd say his voice will definitely drop",

So many isekais seem to not understand what makes isekais work.  Or what makes them good.  Jobless Reincarnation seems to get it EXACTLY.  Everything about it.  There is clear character growth.  A well established world.  There are stakes and real impact on the things that happen.  While the MC is powerful, they aren't unbeatable.  And they created characters you actually CARE ABOUT.  Crazy concept in some of these isekais.  While also having an amazing art style and a brilliant musical score that makes most episodes feel more like a movie than a tv show.    \n\n\nI'm so hyped that we are getting more Jobless Reincarnation (Apparently a lot more in the coming years.) - And that shows that deserve to be hits.  Get the recognition they deserve.  Doesn't always happen. It's clear that the studio crafting this show has a real passion towards getting it right.  At least... So far.  (This studio was FOUNDED to make this anime so I'd expect nothing less - although they now have branched out and done more as well.)",

I wouldn't ask my friend who knows nothing about football to say who the best linebackers are. So in that same way, I'm saying to look around on this subreddit, of people who absorb dubs and can make informed opinions. So yes, when you say something like \"I thought her voice was well-known for being bad\", and then not even linking to the one place where those opinions are the most well-informed, it doesn't really hold much water. Especially since you said  that's it's old news here, and don't link anything, well, here. \n\nI mean, look at some of these coments:\n\n\"who tf watches dubbed anime\"\n\n\"Funimation has a habit of reusing the same voices for stereotypes in anime, you can guess who will be voice acting a character most of the time and that's probably the most unappealing thing about the company\" (note: not even kind of true)\n\n\"I am getting pre-sad thinking how they will fuck up the demon god language\" (note: they didn't, this is more bias showing on something that at the time didn't even exist yet).\n\n\"Most anime dubs make me cringe' (again, this is a direct link to this comment)\n\n\nThese are biased comments, some you directly linked to. I am not making an opinion of anything related to her voice, I am not asking you to change your opinion of your voice. I am just saying that you cannot trust comments like these. You might as well be asking r/anime. What did r/animedubs think of this anime dub?",

I'm talking about anyone who drops by randomly.  Like it or not, Eris's voice was a _considerable_ point of contention for this dub.  The typical pattern of comments went: \"The dub was fine until Eris.\"  Whole topics were started to talk about Eris's voice specifically.\n\nYou are desperately fixated on disqualifying these Eris-directed comments by pointing to completely different comments that dismiss dubs wholesale.  It's not a convincing argument.",

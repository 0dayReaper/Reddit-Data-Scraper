I get this year denying her sugar, but if the crops recover then they cannot deny it in the future. Unless they have a exclusive contract. One final thing how about stop blaming Ann. Jonas was declared a cheater by the King and judge not Ann.",

Anne's mom was a sugar master, and she's treated like garbage everywhere she goes. Is the sexism in this world really so high as to even consider that she might be worth paying attention to? Also, wouldn't more people know her name? I get she's also not really proclaiming who she is, but some people should know.",

Anne saying that Challe is with her because it makes her so happy was precious, and Challe asking if she wants him here with her is just as sweet as the original line, \"Do you want to be away from me?\" Challe's oblivious answer when Anne asks him how her hair looks was great too - \"No issues.\" \ud83d\ude04 He clearly can't tell when a girl is hoping for compliments.\n\nKieth's voice sounds good in the English dub, though Sammy's is deeper than I expected.",

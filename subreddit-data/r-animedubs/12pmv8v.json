Then to have him *steal* a piano from a public venue so he can do just that fucking killed me XD This show is such a trip, I love it! \n\nAlso, what just happened with Rose? She was possessed? Like how all the core members of Shadow Garden were, but less advanced? Did Shadow/Cid do anything to her other than cure her of that? Because he certainly made it sound like he gave her some sort of power the way he did the others. Does this mean she'll be joining as the newest alphabetized member of Shadow Garden soon, or will he be leaving her to her own devices? Exciting times ahead! And now I have to wait a whole other week to see them T-T",

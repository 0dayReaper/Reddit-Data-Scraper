I love how great power has consequence in this anime.\n\nBoth anime have their fun moments, both also have their dark bits too. Overall well balanced fantasy magic anime that are not so well known and have amazing dubs.",

I would recommend seeing a therapist after watching it as every character in that show needs therapy and I actually vomited watching the show because of how screwed up the whole thing was. I only finished it because I was halfway through and I don\u2019t back down from a challenge. Worst 24 hours of my life in the last decade.",

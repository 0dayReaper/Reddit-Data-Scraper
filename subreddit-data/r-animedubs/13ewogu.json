So that excuse isn't the best one to use for the delay, just makes them look amateur.\n\nThen there's Toonami jail where they hold dub rights in the void for ages. SAO Alicization War Arc took almost two years to be available to access outside of Toonami for example due to how far apart the cours aired from each other and the slow dub turnaround on Toonami was. \n\nWith no legal means to access it if you happen to be in an English speaking country outside the US since they aren't adapting to the modern streaming world.",

            "comment": "I loved the progression in the first half of the episode. Jun is finally starting to see Tomo as a girl he's interested in, even though he has a hard time admitting it, but the signs are all clear - thinking Tomo looked nice in her uniform, coming to the ramen shop every day just to see her *and* waiting to walk her home. It seems he feels like they need a chaperone now too. \ud83d\ude04 Tomo picked a great gift for him, and it's sweet that they'll match \"just like teammates\". \n\nWhile I enjoyed the hilarious conversation at the end where Tomo and Jun were practicing for the play (and Jun as a tree), I'm not a fan of Misuzu's plots becoming more cruel/dangerous. I know she feels bad about it, but that seems to be guilt about messing things up for Tomo rather than concern that she might have hurt Jun. It's also a bit strange to me that if they don't like their roles in the play, they wouldn't simply insist on a different one, especially when Misuzu's was decided without her being present and Tomo is being pushed into playing a guy when she really wants people to see her as a girl.",

It doesn't really feel like a coherent story arc. It's almost like nothing really happened this whole season. Nagatoro in comparison has had a lot of development this season.",

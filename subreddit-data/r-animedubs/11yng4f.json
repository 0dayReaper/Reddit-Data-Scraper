I guess CR was able to work out some kind of deal with Sunrise that would let them simuldub it.\n\nAnyway, I'm just glad that Raeliana is getting dubbed. It really looks like something my sister would enjoy.\n\nWait, why the hell isn't Demon Slayer on here?

Aside from *some* of the sequel/spin-offs, Raeliana, A Galaxy Next Door, and maybe My Clueless First Friend there's not much for me to watch this season. \n\nGiven their track record as of late, I wouldn't be surprised if they pick a third-rate isekai or some obscure show that hardly anyone one cares about for their next backlog dub over Bocchi, In/Spectre S2, and The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten.",

Does backlogs usually come out within the same year?\n\nI kinda wish they allowed fans to vote on some of the animes they get dubbed, because sometimes they dub stuff that no one is interested into. Either that or just dub everything, but I know that's not possible unfortunately XD",

Their streaming platform is HiDive (as opposed to Crunchyroll) and they are currently owned by AMC Networks.\n\nSentai/HiDive announced that they had Oshi no Ko [back in November of last year.](https://www.hidive.com/news/2022/11/19/spy-classroom-and-kubo-won-t-let-me-be-invisible-kick-off-hidive-s-upcoming-winter-simulcasts-included-in-exciting-lineup-of-eight-new-titles-for-2023) They're also going to be screening [the first episode as well as some other content](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2023-03-27/anime-boston-screens-n-american-premiere-of-oshi-no-ko-anime/.196503) at Anime Boston this coming weekend, and Sentai has (in the past) often made license and dub announcements at events. Given that Sentai (to my knowledge) still has yet to announce any dubs for Winter 2023 (the season that just finished) let alone for Spring 2023, they could drop some new information at any time.",

Wait, winter as well? does that mean they don't dub shows alongside their release like crunchyroll does? Sorry for all the questions! I only started getting into anime a couple of years ago, so still trying to immerse myself with all the info XD I appreciate all your help btw.",

To the Swordsmith Village being dubbed just before the season premiere really doesn't mean they'll simuldub the next arc. If they do choose to simuldub it for once, it will happen after the first 6-8 episodes are out in sub, but I'm not holding my breath for that.",

But Neir and Misfit being so far behind may be an issue that delays the start\n\nDoubt it'll be as bad as S1 where the dub didn't start until after the 24 epsiodes sub run ended entirely (and had Toonami jail for a year after that for streaming). Aniplex only really does that for Sword Art Online content anymore",

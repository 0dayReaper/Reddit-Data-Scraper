I know that Poland has a really high rate of English-speakers, so I guess maybe they just think you'll watch the English dub? \n\nThat's stupid regardless -- I can't imagine it's *that* much cheaper, since you still have to translate, do audio, etc. Though I guess it saves on studio space? Like... It doesn't cost much more to hire two people to act. Unless Polish VAs get salary or base pay?\n\nNow I want to go look into that practice.",

Usually its reserved for situation where TV station are buying rights to broadcast live action movies and they don't want to pay additional licencing fees for the dubs, even tho they already exist like for example Marvel movies. \n\nThe origin of \"lector\" starts like when Poland was still in its communism era, where it was fairly expensive to make dubs (animations were an exception), but for some reason it never faded away. I find it really messed up tho that they are using \"lector\" voice over in anime shows on D+ (Star Wars Vision got a proper dub tho). At least Netflix is doing great in that department, because they introduced at the beginning of 2022 their first batch of anime dubs in eastern european languages (hungarian, czech, polish) and they never used a \"lector\". God bless them, because finally polish VAs get to work on anime and they are doing great ans improving with every title. Some shows like \"Bastard\" were actually so fucking funny because the polish scriptwriters went above and beyond with some of the lines in the script.\n\nAlso a fun fact, Dragon Ball has a really famous story about the use of \"lector\" here in Poland. They basically took the French dub and made a \"lector\" voice over it in polish. It must sound really bizzare for every other country lmao.

While I still thoroughly enjoyed it and think it has a fantastic story, the English Dub voice acting was just\u2026 subpar compared to most of the stuff coming from Crunchyroll. The exception being Ushio ane Shinpei.\n\nAdditionally the watching experience in Hulu is just TERRIBLE. I can\u2019t express in text how frustrating it was to zone out during a commercial and miss a few seconds of animation or conversation, hit the rewind and get the SAME COMMERCIALS AGAIN. Good lord I wanted to punch my laptop. Anyway. Rant over. \n\nHopefully this trend continues and they Dub the series in a timely manner as well.",

Some people have accents for no reason (and it doesn't seem to be a dialect thing). From an audio perspective, some actors sounded far different compared to others. And one of the worst things that I didn't see anyone bring up: the pronunciation of a main character's name was changed mid-way through the show.\n\nThe main thread had the bulk of the issues listed there if you want to see more.",

Not to blame the actress -- acting a character who has an opposite sex split personality is something most veteran voice actors would struggle with.!&lt;\n\nThere's several other issues with the script and the general presentation, but far be it from me to ruin your enjoyment of it -- if you like it, more power to you. As I said, the subs were bad as well (I know enough Japanese to recognize errors pretty frequently), so I mostly just want Disney held accountable for shitty localization in general.",

If they didn't do so just to watch s2 of Tokyo Revengers (because s1 was on CR) then they won't bother with this show.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that Iger could very well still make cuts to the Japanese/Asia-Pacific branch of the company as part of his massive round of cost-cutting and layoffs (i.e. laying off the very people who made the Kodansha deal to begin with) which in turn will affect D+ and the anime that airs on it.\n\nEdit: Just my surprise, D+ dumped the show onto the service not even using the translated Heavenly Delusion name but with the Romaji title instead.

Even as far as added hard R horror flicks and advertising it with the D+ banner.\n\nPlus so far out of their anime offerings they haven't censored anything to my knowledge, but at the same time they haven't really gotten anything particularly questionable (like say a heavy Ecchi series)\n\nMy only issue with them is the Netflix style jail, but they seem to be adjusting to that. Dub quality for STR could use some work, but I'll chalk that up to being on of their first dubs, they may still improve with him.",

The issue is that large conglomerates are by their very nature anti-competitive. Media companies, in particular, Disney, are some of the most obvious violators of free market competition. If Disney wanted to they could simply outbid every other service. I wouldn't even be surprised if they purchased CR or Sentai.\n\n&gt;Sentai depsite the AMC cash influx are still cheap as ever. \n\nFor now. CR is the only anime-dedicated streaming service so they have less of an incentive to keep prices low and they need more money because they have to spend more on licenses to challenge the well-resourced services. \n\n&gt;Disney at least seem to be changing their ways a decent bit in recent years, at least since they bought out Fox. \n\nAt that same time, they have also sold out to Chinese censorship and censored LGBTQ+ content among other issues. A few seemingly good years does not negate the legitimate concerns we should express about Disney. Plus Bob Igor is back. The last CEO looked down on animation and might have loosened control out of a lack of interest and attention.\n\n&gt;Plus so far out of their anime offerings they haven't censored anything to my knowledge\n\nToo early and too few anime licenses to make a definitive statement either way. Not too soon to raise legitimate concerns.\n\nThe consolidation of the anime media market is deeply troubling and it is something that anime communities need to talk about.",

They're not just gonna choose to make *everything* kid-friendly just for the hell of it, if that's what you're thinking. Hell, they literally have a show called Little Demon, which is basically a huge gore-fest with satanic themes, on their platform that's highly controversial among religious families.\n\nSo\u2026 unless I missed something or if there will be a drastic change in the future, I have yet to see anything to be afraid of here.",

I may have acted similarly to you in the past, but at least I can be reasoned with and get tired of worrying about the same thing all the time. I'm done with you. Have fun overthinking for the rest of your life. Bye. \ud83d\udc4b",

It is newsworthy anytime they begrudgingly release a rated-R series.

They might also try to directly influence the actual production in Japan and censor through that influence. \n\nWe aren't talking about an unknown company here. This is Disney and there is plenty of evidence of their business strategy which is the appeal to the largest audience possible at the expense of core fandoms.",

In fact, the English Ghibli dubs were some of the best (or for the more cynical, the only good things) Lucasfilm made under Disney.",

It wasn\u2019t bad, just underwhelming.  However the sequel trilogy was terrific, and so was the Willow series (pity it stopped after season 1; despite its quirks I enjoyed it unreservedly).",

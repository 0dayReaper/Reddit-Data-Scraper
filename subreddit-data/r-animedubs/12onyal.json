The comedic scene right after the dad saw her bruised up is a bit weird tonally\u2026 but I liked the way the closet scene messed with our perception of time.",

            "comment": "\"Japanese dad beats daughter's boyfriend to death with rice cooker\" sounds like the punchline of an Asian joke, not the plot of an anime lmao.\n\nThe mom is hands down best waifu. She literally helps hubby hide the body. If your spouse did that, you know they're a keeper.\n\nThe show seems intriguing. Protective dads aren't an entirely new concept, but this time he's an ordinary dude, not Liam Neeson with a particular set of skills. It looks like the Yakuza are going to put two and two together, and then the plot will take off.",

He will have to go to even greater lengths to protect his family. It was a good first episode of the show. So I look forward to how this goes.",

To have a valid claim of (lethal) self defense, the attacker has to be an imminent deadly force threat, and even though he made lots of threats about killing a bitch, said bitch was nowhere near endangered, therefore there was no imminent threat.\n\nIn fact, the dad struck first with that E. Honda slap to DEEZ NUTZ. Also in self defense, you can't initiate aggression and then use it as an excuse to use force on your victim under the guise of self defense.\n\nThat said, if he was tried, he might find a jury that would refuse to convict him.",

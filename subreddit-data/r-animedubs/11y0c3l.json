Basically shows with MC's like Ayanokoji from Classroom of the Elite or Leon from Trapped in a Dating Sim.\n\nDubbed anime is preferred obviously, but I don't mind getting subbed recommendations as well.",

But, the eminence in shadow MC definitely isn\u2019t trying to just fit in and stay in the background. He plays up the whole background character thing, sure, but he isn\u2019t staying in the background, at all. Not even his background character is. I think OP is looking for a cheat code MC who knows what is going on, but chooses to live a normal life, while unknown to everyone else the MC is moving to pieces.\n\nThe eminence in shadow MC is a cheat code who doesn\u2019t know what is going on and is choosing to live in the spotlight as his shadow character, with his background character lifestyle just a setup to make it seem more cool.\n\nI know he says he works from the shadows and all, but he really just does whatever he wants as his shadow character, which happens to all work out perfectly, with him somewhat plotting the perfect move but mostly just also stumbling into it by doing whatever he thinks looks cool. Not an aloof overpowered MC, or a secretly plotting MC, but an example overpowered MC who is living out his fantasy of having a secret identity that has the spotlight instead of his regular identity.\n\n\nI commented bc I didn\u2019t think it was what OP was looking for. I would compare Ayanokoji to Saiki for some reasons, but definitely not the shadow MC.",

A very enjoyable show, not the intense, edge of your seat, type of show, but enjoyable and comfy. He talks really fast though but you get used to it\n\nYou still might like eminence in shadow, I\u2019ve watched what has been released in the dub, so episode 13, and I like it. Definitely over hyped and im not sure why, but it is good for what it is. A dude who took his fantasy to the extreme irl and now gets to do it in a fantasy world. Isekai obviously\n\nAnyway I\u2019ll be back with my other recs",

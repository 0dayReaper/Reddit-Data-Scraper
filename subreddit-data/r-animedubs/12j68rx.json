    "postText": "So I just finished a rewatch of **A Sister's All You Need**.  \n\nIf I was a betting man I would say my money is on Chihiro being Felecia Angelle.  But everywhere I googled [Arielle O'Neil](https://animevoiceover.fandom.com/wiki/Arielle_O%27Neil)  is credited as the VA.  \n\nIs this a VA I've never heard of that happens to sound exactly like her?  \n\nOr is this an alias of Felecia Angelle?",

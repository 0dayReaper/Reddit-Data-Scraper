            "comment": "While Kiruko walking in on Maru and the motel chick in the middle of apparent doggy style was hilarious, the part immediately before that was pretty damned interesting. Maru touching the girl triggered the Maru Death Touch (or whatever the fuck they're calling it now) that only works on Man Eaters. We got clued into this  earlier in the episode when the Maru Death Touch didn't work on the mangey bear. This would logically mean the motel girl is, at least partially, a Man Eater.\n\nThere's also Tokio. I was assuming she and Maru were clones or something, and she only had a girl voice be cause Japan loves the androgynous types. Unless the boobs are a lie, she's a chick. The most likely possibility is that they're maternal twins. Both have weird powers, Tokio with her camera cloaking and Maru with his Death Touch, and both look almost identical.\n\nI'm honestly trying to fit all the puzzle pieces together here. I'm assuming humanoid Man Eaters, like the motel girl and I assume the kids at the institute, are some really rare, naturally occuring mutation of Man Eaters, and the reason for the institute is to tame/study them.",

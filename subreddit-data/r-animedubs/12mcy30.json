The Finale is really out this Time:\n\nWell this wraps up which was honestly a very complicating dub, I felt like if Bang Zoom got the rights to dub, We Wouldn't have so much recasts. I know Okratron did their Best even if they couldn't most of the video game cast back despite announcing the legacy cast. I'm just hoping in the DVD Release, Sean, Xanthe, Michelle and Everyone else who were in the games but couldn't play their roles in the Anime could reprised and re record their lines in the home video release.",

            "comment": "Well. They tried.\n\nIt was called the Northern War, but the war only happened for like one and a half episodes. Come on, man.\n\nAs someone who enjoys the Trails series, this was a fun bit of fanservice and lore, seeing references to older games and cameos by characters. The cameos from Renne, Kevin, and Ries near the end were great.\n\nOf course, that's only because I already enjoy and know the history that I enjoyed this series, I think. A new viewer is going to be bombarded with references and cameos that go right over their head, and since the Trails series is a long line of games (nine in English, tenth coming out soon) it kind hurts the experiences.\n\nThe recasts were disappointing. I've had Sean Chiplock as Rean for near 500 hours of gameplay (holy shit), and even if Eric Vale didn't do bad, it's just jarring to hear a different voice. The new characters weren't bad, either, but unlike the characters I've grown to love over the series, they were just kind of... there.\n\nI think we need a good adaptation based on Trails In The Sky. Even the OVA covered barely a quarter of the plot of the second game while ignoring the first.",

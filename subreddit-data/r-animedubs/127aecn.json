(Akiba Maid War for example was such a WTF is this and why do I love it so much?!?!?! Kind of surprise.)  That said... I think even Isekai has room to go in new and interesting directions.  Uncle in Another World for example took the Isekai trope parodied it in a way I've never seen done quite like it before.  I thought it was great.  And Eminence of Shadow is abundantly aware of what it is, and doing it diffferently than most Isekai.  That said... Yes, I always appreciate when anime tries something different.  But I get why studios are leery of trying something too different.  It's high risk for something that's pretty low margin as is.  Isekais. No matter how average they are.  Usually make studios money right now.  If they do something completely different, sure it might be a hit.  But it also might be a flop.  I see why it's happening.",

If most people in Germany are only interested in shojo magical girl anime, you're unlikely to get many shonen isekai dubs in German, even if they were the most popular shows in Japan right now. And the more shows they dub in a season with the same target audience, the lower the return on each, so the more likely they'll pick a less popular show for a different audience. \n\nAlso, the cost to dub will affect it. All else equal, the more major characters, the more dialog, the more mouth movement to sync with dialog, etc, the more expensive it'll be to dub it. \n\nAlso, the more people who subscribe and ONLY watch dubs, the more dubs we're gonna get, cause they know they need those for our subscription dollars. So never watch subs! \ud83d\ude02\n\n(Disclaimer: this is based on economics and a general understanding of the industry, nothing specific to CR. For all I know they have monkeys throwing darts at a wall covered in anime characters, and they pick the ones to dub that the most monkeys hit with darts)",

I can do it, but generally, in really short bursts with low action. I tend to seek out the manga for things that dont get dubbed.

I know there are MANY shows I've watched that in practice didn't seem like something I would like.  Sometimes I end up liking it far more than I expected (I can't even count the number of times this has happened.) - Sometimes... It's just as bad or worse than I expected haha.  (And there are a number of very popular animes that I just haven't been able to get into at all - not surprisingly to me.)  \n\n\nThe good news is they put out so many animes each season now that it's pretty hard to ever get COMPLETELY caught up.  But, you do start having to get less picky after you've watched enough because your options start running out.",

There is a lot of god awful anime out there that MAL has sub 5 that I'm probably not in a rush to watch.  (and unfortunately some I have.) - But yeah.  Of anime in the top 200 on MAL that has dubbed.  I've probably watched the majority of it.  And beyond.   My MAL is getting pretty filled.  (Not including the stuff I just forgot to add to MAL because I watched it before I had a MAL and didn't keep track.)  MY MAL has me at around 600 shows watched currently.  Given stuff I probably just never documented on MAL I'm probably closer to 800 or 900.  And given probably about 85-90% of what I've watched either was dubbed or had a dub available...  Yeah.  I've watched a lot lol",

It gets harder.    \nEventually you start having higher expectations from your anime.  When you know what an 8 or a 9 or a 10 anime is... Why do you wanna stick around for a 5?  Most anime's I'll give at least a couple episodes.  But there are a lot of clunkers out there. I'd say of the 3000+ - at least 1/3 of that is worth no ones time lol. Unfortunately there is A LOT of bad anime out there (and a lot of good anime.) - and I'd say at least 1/6 of that would be stuff that will never be up my alley.  Period.  For example I have no real interest in BL anime.  Just not for me.  So, that eliminates most if not all of those.  --- So.  You could see where you would start running out when you start nearing the 750-1000 animes watched range.",

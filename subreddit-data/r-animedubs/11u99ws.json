The entirety of Love Hina and especially\n\n2. the more recent English localisations of the Evangelion franchise (particularly Rebuild of Evangelion that started with 3.0).",

The Netflix dub of the original series also has good talent but suffers from too much literalism as well, but the Funimation dubs of the Rebuilds were phenomenal and should've been allowed to be finished how they saw fit.",

That's why they had to stretch, compress and trim things to make it work with new footage.\n\nBut if they were working officially, they'd have access to the masters: the individual layers for background music, sound effects, etc. from HD, and possibly the dialogue masters for the original dub. With all that, it would be possible to mix the old dub with the new music/effects pretty smoothly. Though I don't really know how much it would cost compared to redubbing, you'd think doing it just in audio post-production would be at least a bit cheaper than re-recording the entire thing (and still needing to do post-production mixing in either case).",

And I'm pretty sure it fit 99% of the way. \n\nI still think that they could have gotten a good chunk of the OG cast back, had they asked, but they went for the cheapest option, and produced a sub-par product, that was badly translated, badly made, and lacked any soul.",

Too much meaning is always lost in translation. And the better the original dialogue, almost certainly the worse the translation. The more Japanese I learn the more I find myself disliking subs even and avoiding reading them as much as I can.\n\nDubbing is an art beyond even subbing, which already is fraught with difficulty. It\u2019s important for a work of art to retain everything which its creator imbues it with. Translation of dialogue in works with written components is the easiest way for a work to lose a lot of that meaning, if not all in some cases.",

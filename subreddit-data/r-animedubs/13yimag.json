To the point where at the time, people were already saying how obvious it was. I didn't want to believe it, because I feel it sort of  steps on the wholesomeness of the show. I could be wrong, we'll see when I get back to current.",

My head canon's been that she was the original Kaguya (or maybe what inspired her legend?) since like episode 2 season 1, so I was all ready after that opening scene here to bust open the chat saying \"this is a mislead with the hair pin and the voice! The one giving the ohagi is definitely Tsukasa!\" so imagine my surprise when they *actually* confirmed it! Which of course, in turn, also confirms that she doesn't age and is either extremely long-lived with near or literally eternal youth or just straight up immortal. I honestly never thought they would actually do that, just dance around it with big hints like they have been since day 1. I wonder if this means this season will be concluding with an arc related to her past and how old she is.",

And of course her intimate knowledge of historical things like buildings and events, and the whole nostalgic scene with her at the site of the old Heian-era palace. Coupled with the general lunar/night sky theme of the show (it's called Over the Moon for You, Nasa's name means Starry Sky, etc) and my money is on her either being Princess Kaguya, or being a similar entity who inspired the tale of Kaguya.",

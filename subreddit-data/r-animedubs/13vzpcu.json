He moved the US when he was 10 years old. And some of his early teaching tools and inspirations came from the video games and shows he watched when he was a kid. Aleks is a very talented voice actor with a very fun, adorkable, and friendly personality that is just hard to dislike. He's passionate in his work, and gives everything 110% (which always surprises me in that he doesn't blow out his vocal chords when voicing a screamy character).\n\nYou can hear Aleks as a seasonal regular in CR shows. And imo, may just have the busiest 2023 thus far: Thorfinn (Netflix dub), Anos Voldigoad, Mash, Takafumi Takaoka (Uncle from Another World- Netflix). From the cringey screamers, to absolute chads, to powerful fighters, and much more, there is no limit to this man's power!\n\nWhat are your favorite roles?\n\n\\- **Zenitsu** (Demon Slayer)\n\n\\- **Thorfinn** (Vinland Saga)\n\n\\- **Kazuya Kinoshita** (Rent a Girlfirend)\n\n\\- **Luke** (Street Fighter)\n\n\\- **Anos Voldigoad** (Misfit at Demon King Academy)\n\n\\-  **Sonon Kusakabe** (Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade)",

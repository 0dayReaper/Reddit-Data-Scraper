Send my soul to heaven!\n\nPoor poor Nasa, he's probably thinking of those Las Vegas weddings. But man, it takes a lot of time, commitment, and freaking stress. But maybe one day, even if it's a very small private ceremony, maybe we'll see these two have the happiest day of their lives and maybe the final ep will be the Tsukasa in a wedding dress reveal.\n\nI love how the ending of the OVA has the two getting freaky with each other, and the ending of the 1st ep has them reciting wedding vows both in their futton. And it just sends my heart going doki doki.\n\nLastly, that Lighting Legs by Charlotte!\n\nWelcome back to all of the fine cast and crew. This was one of my fave shows a few years ago. This one is gonna be a fun sweet one.",

MOVIE DATE! MOVIE DATE!\n* Tsukasa's warning about bladders and movie length is right.\n* SO MANY NEW REACTION IMAGES FROM THE MOVIE THEATER SCENE ALONE!\n* THEY HAVEN'T ACTUALLY HAD A CEREMONY YET?!?!?!\n* \"What do you think this is, an isekai?\" **SHOTS FIRED!**\n* 150,000 Yen is about $1500, which I'm pretty sure is actually pretty average for most weddings. Hell, I'm pretty sure when my dad got remarried a few years ago he and my stepmother spent way less than that on their ceremony. That said, $70K for a wedding is pretty fucking overpriced.\n* Wasn't expecting the blonde gremlin to be back already. That said, is Lizzie using a different voice for her? You can still tell it's the same VA, but she sounds slightly more mature this time.\n* Of course Aya would freak out about Nasa and Tsukasa having an indirect kiss...\n* Not gonna lie, I was expecting them to accidentally purchase a porn mag instead of a wedding one\n* \"Come on, darling. You have to let me finish...\" INB4 somebody clips that for a fan-made porn animation.",

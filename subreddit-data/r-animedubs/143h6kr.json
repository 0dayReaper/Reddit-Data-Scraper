I mean, I guess everyone's got a breaking point and maybe watching his mother/favourite idol get murdered in front of him was his (which, you know, fair), but it just seems like there's a bit of a continuity break between the two mindsets. One would think a (former) doctor would be among the most averse to making it his life's goal to ice someone.",

Only for the end to imply she might be getting played, and finding that out might put her in a bad spot. She's quickly made it to a favorite character though.",

Ironically, I think the \"bad\" acting stood out more in the sub - the one guy halting his words for dramatic effect was pretty funny though. \n\nIt always amazes me how Aqua thinks he's a bad actor despite being able to analyze the emotions and portrayal of a scene so well. He just has to make use of his unique talents! This overly analytical side of looking at a performance was actually what made Ai so successful.",

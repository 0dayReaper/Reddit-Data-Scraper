Erika Harlacher and Cherami Leigh working overtime with two roles in this haha.\n\nIf you think Erika Harlacher having two roles in an anime dub wasn't enough, just watch the dub for the 2021 *Shaman King* series also done at VSI Los Angeles, she literally voices like 1/2 of the cast in the show (the majority of them the female characters) as she voices Kororo, Keiko Asakura (Yoh and Hao's Asakura's mother), Young Amidamaru, Mannoko Oyamada (Manta's Sister), Matilda Matisse (ep. 13), Meene Montgomery and now Lady Sati of Gandhara.",

On top of that, I also was right on Amber Lee Connors, Cristina Vee, Erika Harlacher and Sean Chiplock being cast as Shouko Komi, Ren Yamai, Akako Onigashima, and Shigeo Chiarai respectively through my [dream cast thread of Komi](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/comments/q3fbvm/dub_cast_predictions_for_blue_period_and_komi/) considering they were my personal picks to voice these characters, especially Cristina Vee as Ren Yamai.\n\nNow I've got 5 correct castings for Komi.",

Kyle McCarley is fantastic as Hitohito Tadano from what I've heard in the clip and can't wait to hear the rest of his performance and also Amber May as the narrator along with the brief sounds of Amber Lee Connors as Komi also were fantastic.\n\nI so want for the dub to be released on Netflix immediately along with listening to Skyler Davenport, Cristina Vee and Sarah Anne Williams performances as Najimi, Ren Yamai, and Himiko Agari respectively especially the former two due to their hilarious one-liners.\n\nAlso, I was right on the money on Kira Buckland and Sean Chiplock being cast as Makeru Yadano and Shigeo Chiarai. Now they are the 4-5th actors I got right.",

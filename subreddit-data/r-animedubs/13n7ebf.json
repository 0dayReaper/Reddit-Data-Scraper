As much as i love Gabimaru and Sagiri, more Yuzuriha please!\n\nLoved seeing Sagiri go full on badass. Reminds me of the Bruce Lee quote \u201cBe like water\u201d. Loved it when the scenes went silent and still to match that intense mental focus of her. Almost reminded me of Tanjiro.",

Might even have been the type to be too strong for his age, since it seems like he killed his parents when he was young.\n\nWonder what's up with the chubby glasses guy. Yuzuriha implied that he's not as benign as he lets on.",

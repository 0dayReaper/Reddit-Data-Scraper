    "postText": "The Spring 2023 anime season has kicked off and it's also the anniversary season of the Crunchyroll-Funimation merger. There were numerous changes that occured as soon as the merger took effect, most importantly the removal of remote recording and the implementation of the in-studio voice work only policy for all of Funiroll's in-house dubs moving forward. As a result, the voice actors outside Texas especially those in LA, who showcased their talent in many of Funimation's dubs during the peak of the pandemic and the remote recording era have now been blocked from appearing in their new dubs, unless they literally fly or even move to Texas (like what Matthew Rudd and Landon McDonald did) in order to continue to get work in-person with Crunchyroll. \n\nSince then, almost all new seasonal anime titles that post-merger Crunchyroll has licensed and dubbed and will dub every season will feature only Texas-based casts, with the exception of Chainsaw Man and MHA which allowed remote casting and recording because both shows were hyped.  **Remote recording is now only permitted for reprisals**. Also, with the exception of Mob Psycho 100 III, only sequels or new seasons of anime titles that were LA dubs before the merger, have remained LA dubs and retained their cast like Bookworm S3, Rent a Girlfriend S2, To Your Eternity S2 and Iruma-kun S3. Fortunately, aside from video games and commercials, LA VA's do still get dubbing work on non-sequel anime titles that are licensed by **Aniplex of America** such as Lycoris Recoil, Engage Kiss and Nier Automata, since all their dubs (excluding Kaguya-sama and Millionaire Detective) are typically LA dubs. Netflix has also been very warm and friendly to LA VA's thanks to their contract with SAG-AFTRA.\n\nWith that said, how do you think do the LA VA's adapt to these changes and what are the chances more LA VA's will follow Matthew and Landon's footsteps and move to Texas just to continue getting more anime roles?",

At that time, Sunrise/Bandai got out of the licensing/distributing anime business, and this was about when ADV went bankrupt (before eventually coming back as Sentai Filmworks). I remember sitting in on a Funimation industry panel at a local convention where Adam Sheehan explained the only reason Funimation survived at the time was because they had embraced the early days of simulcasting, so they weren't entirely reliant on DVD sales like the other distributors.\n\nThe reason I bring this up is because, when Sunrise/Bandai fell, LA dubbing diminished pretty greatly at that time as most of their dubs were produced in LA. This is when a lot of the LA dubbing voice actors of that era started finding their ways into other voice acting venues (like non-Japanese developed games, or union western animation). LA dubbing never completely died, but it did limp along for a while afterwards, whereas Texas dubbing (specifically Dallas-based dubbing for FUnimation) remained consistent. After so many years, more companies licensing and distributing anime formed again, and dubbing in LA became more common again. It still wasn't as prevalent as in Texas, specifically with Funimation, but there were more LA dubs happening. \n\nI think, unfortunately, this is going to be a cycle for LA that we'll see multiple times throughout history. It's been well established that the entertainment industry at large has a low opinion of dubbing, and most of the entertainment industry at large is operated in LA. Meanwhile, in Texas, the vast majority of voice over work is anime, so its preservation is taken very seriously, and they are trying to acquire more and more of it to keep it going.\n\nWe all know that moving recording to in-studio, to whatever extent they have in any given season, is simply a cost saving method on Crunchyroll's part. The pandemic days were great for casting diversity, but they were pretty awful for audio quality consistency, and trying to get everyone's audio to sound the same clearly cost a lot of time and money Crunchyroll didn't want to be paying anymore. And that's before discussions about them wanting to pay union costs even come into play.\n\nThe big difference between now and when the anime bubble burst is there are so many more dubbing voice actors across all locale markets. So even if the LA actors start really gunning for other types of games and animation, their competition is a lot steeper. So in all likelihood, we probably *will* see more people move like Matthew Rudd or Landon McDonald. It's my understanding that the cost of living in Texas is much lower than in California; it would make sense for actors who are struggling to make ends meet to move to a  cheaper location where they can succeed.\n\nAll of that said, where we are now isn't even *close* to back then. There are still more LA dubs being produced and coming out every season. And thanks to simuldubs, we see them way more consistently, compared to back then when we were still depending on DVDs and the hot new media of Blu-Ray. \n\nTL;DR - We've seen this kind of thing before, and LA dubbing came back. It will come back again in time, but we might see more people jump ship to Texas in the meantime first.",

Instead of FUNimation and Sentai it\u2019s now become Sony and AMC. We\u2019ve never had such large consistent players in the industry before and now that Sony swallowed the two biggest players on the field, there\u2019s not as much room to make large sweeping industry changes right now like before. Disney and Netflix are comfortable just dipping their toes in the scene while producing a dub or two per season and Sentai/AMC feels like they are just trying to stay afloat but also only use TX talent, perhaps if they pivot to outsourcing though that would mean upping dubbing costs that I don\u2019t think they can afford to do. Honestly it just feels like we gotta wait for a new player that really utilizes LA or other talent more. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible, like you said, it just might take a while if at all. But this industry is unpredictable as most are so who knows.",

I remember sitting in on a Funimation industry panel at a local convention where Adam Sheehan explained the only reason Funimation survived at the time was because they had embraced the early days of simulcasting, so they weren't entirely reliant on DVD sales like the other distributors.\n\nBandai left starting in 2011-2013. They were doing fine but the new management that came from Bandai Visual USA (merged with Bandai Entertainment in 2008) believed that the current conditions of the industry were not favorable and they were better off licensing their titles to others. They weren't bleeding money like Geneon was. Bandai was just plain screwed over by its parent. Funimation survived because they licensed way less titles during the heyday (somewhat more than Media Blasters but still significantly less than the amount ADV, Geneon and Bandai licensed). They also had *Dragon Ball Z* as their financial cushion to fall back on. ADV died because of the Sojitz deal going FUBAR. Had they not done that deal, they would have survived to this day because they had some very big hit titles like *Evangelion* classic. In terms of streaming, they also had Anime Network (since succeeded by HIDIVE).\n\n&gt;The reason I bring this up is because, when Sunrise/Bandai fell, LA dubbing diminished pretty greatly at that time as most of their dubs were produced in LA. \n\nIt really started when Geneon died. It only got worse as Funimation and Sentai were left to get the rest of everything else by the start of the 2010s.\n\n&gt;This is when a lot of the LA dubbing voice actors of that era started finding their ways into other voice acting venues (like non-Japanese developed games, or union western animation).

After so many years, more companies licensing and distributing anime formed again, and dubbing in LA became more common again. It still wasn't as prevalent as in Texas, specifically with Funimation, but there were more LA dubs happening.\n\nLA dubs really started coming back starting towards the later half of the 2010s, thanks to Netflix and old Crunchyroll.\n\n&gt;I think, unfortunately, this is going to be a cycle for LA that we'll see multiple times throughout history. It's been well established that the entertainment industry at large has a low opinion of dubbing, and most of the entertainment industry at large is operated in LA. Meanwhile, in Texas, the vast majority of voice over work is anime, so its preservation is taken very seriously, and they are trying to acquire more and more of it to keep it going.\n\nI brought this up in another thread but one of the issues preventing Texas from unionizing is that not only anime dubs have a sheer monopoly of Texas VO work but said anime dubs are monopolized by new Crunchyroll and Sentai. They're pretty much at the mercy of those two companies. If they bring up stuff like unionizing they're risking a blacklist. This is why we need an outside player to rock the boat by doing unionized dubs there. Unfortunately we're not gonna see that with Netflix and Disney (former has the SAG-AFTRA dubbing agreement and studios like Sound Cadence, Okratron 5000 and Studio Nano need to \"buy in\" to the agreement; latter doesn't give a shit and is just gonna stick with LA).\n\n&gt;We all know that moving recording to in-studio, to whatever extent they have in any given season, is simply a cost saving method on Crunchyroll's part.

Heck they may want to try to get other companies to use it if they ever give to Dallas.",

Look, I get that you feel like you need to try to save face after you made a claim that was blatantly factually inaccurate, but let me ask you: what are you even arguing with me for? My comment was meant to be encouraging, that we have seen LA dubs drop off worse than this in the past, and that we will see them come back again one day given time, but in the meantime some people may move to TX if they are struggling in LA. I would never say Matthew Rudd or Landon McDonald were unsuccessful voice actors when they were in LA, but they sure have booked a lot of work since moving to TX, so if it is a matter of pride thing for you, I don't think there is any shame in their latest successes. Natalie Rose Hoover and Mark Allen Jr. both formerly lived in LA and had some measures of success only to move to TX and find greater success as well, and they both moved long before the pandemic, so they're not even recent examples. On the flipside, plenty of voice actors move from TX to LA also. People move to pursue work opportunities all the time, whether they're voice actors or not. If people want to move from LA to TX to pursue anime dubbing, that is their choice, and it has nothing to do with you, whoever you are. So why do you care if they do it? If anything that's just less competition for you as a person \"in the industry,\" right? Let them go. Root for them as they leave. And maybe, just maybe, you'll both get lucky and find greater success in the process.",

Games and western animation simply pay better and provide more stable work than going back to a non-union industry based out of Texas. All this has done is bully and punish people who don't or can't work within Crunchyroll's frankly draconian policies, so they don't bother when there are so many better opportunities out there. It'll result in good talent distancing itself from the industry and normalizing less and less equitable treatment and footholds to gain for new talent.",

I absolutely miss when Funimation was really leading the charge with their blended talent pool and interesting cast lists. I totally understand multiple reasons as to *why* (financial, scheduling, etc...), but it sucks that we weren't able to come to a nice balance now that in-studio/hybrid recording is more of a standard than 100% remote.\n\nThere's a reason that even with the occasional dub that didn't work for me (bound to happen considering their huge output), they were far and away my favorite dubbing studio with NYAV Post close behind. And while I wouldn't say the quality of these cast lists has dropped or anything - it's been great to hear some of the veteran TX actors that weren't really able to get onboard with remote recording once again, and we do still get newcomers to keep things fresh - I know I went from a 60/40 ratio of watching simuldubs:subs to just keeping up with two or so weekly dubs per season because I'm just... not as excited about them? Or I guess excited about the future of the industry at least the way I was in 2021.\n\nNow seeing those names sprinkled in is way more of an exception - i.e. smaller roles in popular titles or literally just One Piece since I don't think there is a TX actor currently working who hasn't been in it, and even then that has had it's own struggles.",

Even with the combined efforts of Netflix, Disney, GKids and Discotek we still only have a handful of LA dubs for series and movies per year, so it\u2019s looking like anime is kinda just largely gonna be TX again for the forseeable future. To be honest, it\u2019s pretty obvious LA got the short end of the stick post-merge than vice-versa. LA studios are still remote recording not only in their *anime* dubs, like Mike Haimoto (**L bozo**) in *Records of Ragnarok* and Emi Lo in every Bang Zoom dub apparently for some reason among other TX talent in LA dubs but as well as a lot of games like *Fire Emblem* and *Street Fighter* and others featuring TX talent. Which is awesome and I love that but I just wish it was two way street where I was seeing more out of state talent in TX dubs. [LA feels like it keeps opening up for TX](https://twitter.com/codaunite/status/1623878186793865216?s=46&amp;t=tcMTzkwifnqQt6rCHNRarw) whereas thanks to Crunchyroll, the door is almost entirely closed for out of state actors, especially after removing remote recording. CR is dubbing like what 15-18 shows in studio this season and we\u2019ve had two LA actors in those dubs as newly casted characters, which were Erica Lindbeck in *MHA* and Kaiji Tang in *Revengers*.\n\nThe anime dubbing scene is always shrinking when it comes to talent. Canada and New York used to be huge dubbing spots, which obviously rarely get used anymore. And LA has largely been relegated to reprisals, which we\u2019re lucky that a lot of series got a chance to be LA dubs before the merger, but as we get less and less of those sequel series, we may be seeing even less LA dubs as times goes on but that might not happen for a while.",

Houston was basically moribund from 2008-2010/2011. A significant number of VAs went over to Dallas to continue their careers. Most came back to Houston but some stuck with Dallas full-time.\n\nBut new Crunchyroll collapsing won't cause an outright death of the Dallas VO scene like ADV on Houston because (at the very least) there's video games (albeit from local studios like Gearbox; don't really see any other game studio giving anything to what they deem an off-the-beaten-track place like Dallas) though they're few and far between. Also there's Discotek (but again few and far between).\n\nBut, realistically, it will take **a lot** to kill new Crunchyroll. The most that can happen is that Disney+ and Netflix get significantly more titles per season (or alternatively woo companies like Toei, TMS Entertainment and Sunrise/Bandai Namco Filmworks/Gundam and become their new \"hubs\"), and this can pretty much only happen by the two taking themselves (even mildly) seriously and proving the Japanese licensors (Japanese licensors really do not want such a monopoly so they're looking for viable alternatives but they're so few and far between that it's become difficult and they're teetering on desperation) that they are a good alternative to Crunchyroll, such as actully marketing and promoting the titles they get and simulcasting.",

This will soften the blow a Crunchyroll collapse will have on the dubbing industry at large. It will be rather unfortunate for Dallas, though, as they don't have much else outside of anime. (but that's why you gotta get the ball rolling towards unionization over there so the \"big\" companies, primarily video games (prelay animation forget it), can see Dallas as not some backwoods, off-the-beaten-track place that would cause a non-local company to be labeled a cheap bastard for using it. Even getting a *twentienth* of video game VO works would do quite a bit for Dallas)\n\nWhether or not the Crunchyroll's doing a lot of its dubs internally is irrelevant to where licenses (and to an extent with it, dubs) will go should they experience even near-death. As I said earlier, licenses (and with it dubs) are gonna be more evenly spread by the time that happens as those licenses will have gone to other companies that have their own choices in dubbing studios to use.\n\n&gt;Disney+ is doing a fraction of a fraction of the dubbing out there.\n\nYeah cuz they're completely new in the ring.

I think anime dubbing as as good if not better than it's ever been.  So... That's just flat out based on opinion.  Unless you think dubbing quality is getting worse.  I personally do not.

Unless you are in the top 1%, or are a corporation, you pay lower taxes and have more social safety nets in CA because most of CA's tax policy is directly tied to your income, flat tax systems like TX high property taxes tend to punish those with less means the most. No anime voice actor is benefiting from TX tax policy. You don't make the +$617,900/yr needed to make it worth being an anime voice actor.  \n\nHousing is another issue, but all the desirable places in Texas are getting expensive too. Dallas-Fort Worth near Funimation HQ is briefly approached $500,000 median home prices earlier in 2023 before the interest rate hikes. Plus, it's not like there aren't affordable places to live in California. You can find $500,000 homes in CA, even near Los Angeles, you just end up in less desirable places with more of a commute like... Fontana or somewhere else in San Bernadino County.  \n\nThough that kind of commute means you may miss out on industry networking opportunities or [late night shenanigans in Little Tokyo](https://twitter.com/JennyYokobori/status/1232448104273608704) with other voice actors.

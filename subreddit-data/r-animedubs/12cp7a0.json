I was happy to hear of the reboot since I thought that finally we can get a dub in this new generation of dubs that would be better than the 4kids dub of TMM. Then I heard Sentai licensed it and I got depressed since Sentai don't dub that much. Then Otakon 2022 happened and they announced a whole bunch of new dubs, I got happy for a minute thinking TMMN was going to be one of them. Then I got depressed again seeing that it was not. Then they put that poll on Twitter asking if they should dub TMMN and the majority of it was yes... Then I was happy until now, they are releasing it sub only. What the fuck sentai!? I mean seriously! Why get peoples hopes up like that?\n\nI will probably still be getting it though, but I am very disappointed by them not dubbing it.\n\nTo me it is like if there is a Slice of Life, Moe, Magical Girl etc show and Sentai get it, don't expect a dub for it. However, if it is an Action, Fantasy or a generic as fuck Isekai, you better believe they will dub it.",

            "comment": "Ayumu and Tokyo Mew Mew New being released subbed only is a very big disappointment, I was hoping either show would've been a much better choice for a Dubcast instead of that bland generic isekai last summer. Sentai really needs to prioritize dubbing popular titles they licensed that really appeal well. But yeah, I'm happy Eizouken is gonna get dubbed so I'm definitely gonna watch it.\n\nSpeaking of which, Sentai literally has Oshi No Ko, perhaps the most anticipated show of the season and it's gonna send emotional shockwaves to those who never read the manga or never even heard of the series. They **MUST** dub it, it would be very unforgivable if they don't.",

It just sucks because not only is it not exactly guaranteed, it at least puts off a potential dub by probably another couple years at the least. Maybe more.",

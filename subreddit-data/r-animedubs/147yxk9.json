Almost reminded me of Xanthe's Haru from P5. But def the 2nd scene that gave me a laughfest was grams and gramps watching the bears and horse race. It felt so random I loved it.\n\nDef looking forward to the b-day celebration. All the while, I like how they hint at some problem arising in Sheelin  that Yuna will probably have to deal with.",

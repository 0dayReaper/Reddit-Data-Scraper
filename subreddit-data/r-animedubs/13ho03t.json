            "comment": "During the battle one of the earth soldiers says \"deploying ECM jammers\". \"ECM\" already stands for electronic countermeasures. While it's technically not incorrect (\"deploying electronic countermeasures, which happen to be jammers\"), it's redundant.\n\nFinally good to see some gritty combat. The episodes with Sophie and the attack on the space station were okay, but didn't have the impact that this episode had.\n\nThe corporate mechs have fancy pants beam weapons while it looks like the earth mechs are limited to ballistics and explosives. The beams seem very effective, while the earthian cannons and missiles scored no kills far as I could tell. Only kills that the earthers made were from blades.\n\nShaddiq being Earth born is a surprise, but it makes sense.\n\n\nGuel continues get character development, which is good. Little girl had to die, which sucks.",

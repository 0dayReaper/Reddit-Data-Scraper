You may have already watched these first few but not listed them on MAL. \n\n* You\u2019ve listed Bungo Stray Dogs up through Season 3, but there is also a movie (canonically between seasons 2 and 3, I believe) and season 4 just finished airing.\n\n* The Fruits Basket prequel movie is on Crunchyroll. \n\n* Mob Psycho season 3 is available on Crunchyroll. \n\n* Steins;Gate 0 is worth watching (I see it\u2019s on your planned list). There is also a movie that\u2019s non-canon, but still pretty decent. 0 is on Crunchyroll although I don\u2019t know where to find the movie.\n\n* Utawarerumono is an interesting series. It isn\u2019t incredible but I enjoyed it. The first series was from like 2006 and then they made a sequel series around 2015 (called \u201cMask of Truth\u201d). There is a follow-up series airing right now also but it\u2019s not done yet as far as I know.\n\n* Castlevania on Netflix isn\u2019t technically anime but it might as well be. Great animation and voice acting.\n\n* The Fate series can be daunting to get into since there are like 15 different series and movies. Crunchyroll has Fate Zero and Fate: Stay Night, which are probably the two best series. Netflix has Fate: Apocrypha and Fate: Lost Encore which are both pretty meh spin-offs.\n\n* Jormungand is a great seinen series. It\u2019s in a similar vein to Black Lagoon. I don\u2019t recall much fan service outside of one scene where you see some tiddies.\n\n* The Magi series is a bit generic but decent. There are 50 episodes split into 2 seasons. Netflix has both seasons (Labyrinth of Magic and Kingdom of Magic). There is also a prequel series called \u201cAdventure of Sinbad\u201d but it looks like Netflix doesn\u2019t have it anymore. \n\n* Spice and Wolf is one of the greatest historical romance/dramas I\u2019ve seen. Highly recommend. \n\n* Talentless Nana is a pretty good suspense/drama show. It\u2019s only 13 episodes so it makes for a quick watch.",

                            "comment": "Utawarerumono is a medieval fantasy series. Action/adventure elements. Some political drama too. Mask of Truth is a little different but takes place in the same universe. \n\nJormungand is about a child soldier who joins a mercenary group. It\u2019s pretty similar to Black Lagoon in terms of tone, although I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as graphic.\n\nI don\u2019t recall Magi having fan service. Although, I haven\u2019t seen the series in several years. It\u2019s a shounen so it may have some scantily clad women here and there. I don\u2019t think it has any \u201cmain character trips and accidentally grabs boob\u201d type of fan service. \n\nSpice and Wolf is adult romance but there is zero fan service. It\u2019s more a historical drama than anything. The anime ends before much actual romance happens.\n\nEdit: if you plan to watch Steins;Gate 0, it is a pseudo-spin off that branches from the main series at episode 23. There is an alternate episode 23 called \u201c23 beta\u201d or \u201c23b\u201d that serves as a lead-in to 0.\n\nEdit 2: Lmao I just decided to rewatch Magi and in the first 10 minutes you see bare tiddies. So maybe it wouldn\u2019t be a great series to watch on a plane.",

Also, here's [a comment in my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/comments/pgn7uj/list_of_59_dubbed_shows_for_isekai_lovers/iovroig) where I also list 29 newer shows I didn't have in the original post.\n\nIt has them ranked by my preference, along with categories(like Fantasy or Game), a description and short review for each show, episode counts, and links to MAL.",

Its also a SoL thus fits both criteria.\n\nTheres 2 seasons of this plus some OVAs and mini-episodes but the only parts that are cannon are the seasons. \n\n[Otaku Elf](https://myanimelist.net/anime/52081) \\- Another reverse isekai about a shut-in elf who just sits around all day playing games and reading manga and the Shrine Maiden who has to care for her.\n\nOnly 2 episodes are out atm but its 100% worth it.",

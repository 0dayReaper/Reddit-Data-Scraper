            "comment": "Mitsuha is very much reminding me of Yuna from Kuma Kuma Bear. She does things for her own selfish reasons, but she's sort of screwing over the people who deserve it. All the while making her own family. And the people she ends up duping are surprised when they learn who she knows, her unassuming character makes for a big surprise (\"Really? The girl in the bear suit killed it?\").",

But instead of beating them with the power of the bear, she's just got the power of advanced civilization from Japan on her side.",

I lost it when the King just walked into the restaurant nonchalantly. Talk about the guy Fing around and finding out.\n\n Mitsuha even made a romantic couple. Next episode looks like she is going to have to deal with monsters. Colette might be in danger, but then Ithink back to her back breaking hugs so she should be fine",

Mitsuha's solution was great, and it was hilarious seeing her act so casual around the king while the restaurant owner is ready to faint from shock. \ud83d\ude04 \n\nIt looks like next week will have a battle with those hobgoblins! Looking forward to seeing Mitsuha use that weapons training.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve noticed a lot more anime games have had options for the dub cast recently. As most of you probably know back in the day it was only Naruto and Dragon Ball where you had an English option every other series it was only subtitles for you but then Hero Aca One\u2019s Justice 2 allowed you play the game with the dub cast and since then every Hero Aca game minus Ultra Impact have featured the dub cast. Then both the new Demon Slayer and One Punch Man games have also featured their dub cast and now even shows that are nowhere near as popular as Demon Slayer, Hero Aca, and Naruto have also featured their dub cast like Kill La Kill and thanks to a recent post fucking Made In Abyss which is the last series I\u2019d expect to have a game with an English audio track hell even the new Tower of God mobile game features English audio although it\u2019s a completely different cast from the anime cause Crunchyroll decided to pull a play right out of 2015 Konami\u2019s playbook apparently. So with this current trajectory do you think it will be commonplace that all anime games in the future will feature the dub cast or still be case by case depending on the series? \n\nI just hope that with this trend the next SAO console game will finally have the dub cast the Japanese cast is great an all but honest I\u2019d rather listen to Bryce and especially Cherami and I\u2019d be really interested to see who\u2019d they cast as Philia which to any SAO fans reading this definitely leave in the comments who you\u2019d cast as Philia off the top of my head I think Erica Lindbeck would be a good pick.",

            "comment": "All anime games is probably a stretch. I think the more niche series that haven't been doing dubs or have dropped them will likely continue to not fund them. The Atelier series dropped it because the cost/benefit wasn't there, and it would allow the games to come out faster in the west. They said they might consider it again if there's more demand, but I don't see it happening. I'm not convinced we'll ever see Senren Kagura or Gal Gun get dubs either. I won't ever say it's impossible with how much more receptive people are becoming to dubs, but I'm not holding my breath.   \n\n\nI don't see companies with a track record of dubbing like Iffy/Compile Heart, Falcom, etc. dropping dubs anytime soon at least. Even the few times they skipped a dub was usually because the game was too old to really make it worthwhile (Trails Crossbell arc) or were crossovers. (Neptunia a few times now)  \n\n\nMajor Anime tie-in games getting dubbed has only been something somewhat recent really outside of Dragon Ball. I'm not entirely sure why it's so sporadic, but I wouldn't be surprised if they're also not done for cost/benefit.   \n\n\nThat said, the landscape *is* changing little by little. Gacha games are getting dubs now, which is pretty crazy. Genshin really showed how strong dubs can be to an audience that probably didn't care or didn't believe it. Anime is also getting more popular in general so the more 'casual' audience might get into it starting with dubs too, which will help the drive for dubs.  \n\n\nI don't think every game will get dubbed, no. There's more than likely just not enough time/money/interest. I'd love to see more niche series get dub love as I'll honestly never play them otherwise, but as a dub fan we'll always miss out on something unless we don't mind making the switch.",

Something like Final Fantasy or Persona that sell 5 million + yeah it is certainly enough.  But games like Atelier that are going to sell 500k-1M maybe not.",

The Sword Art Online games have sold well in the U.S. for ages, but not a single one's been dubbed.",

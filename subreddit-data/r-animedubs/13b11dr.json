            "comment": "Well shit. That's where her name comes from. The cruel joke is \n\nAkane: *exists*\n\nMom: *dies*\n\nAnd her classmates were being bullying little shits. Takada joined in, not because he's mean, but because he's not the sharpest lightbulb in the deck and has a chuunibiyo streak. That never bothered Nishimura since it was clear it wasn't meant to be hurtful (which goes to show words themselves are rarely the problem), but once he finds out where the name came from it really broke him up.\n\nI suspect next episode Nishimura will tell him it's all good and he'll be back to calling her grim reaper again.",

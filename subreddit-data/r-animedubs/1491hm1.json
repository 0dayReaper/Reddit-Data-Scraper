    "postText": "Basically what are some long anime preferably not shonen anime.. The average anime runs at about 12 episodes or 2 cours so about 24 episodes. But what are some anime that have more than that? It can be multiple seasons as long as the episode count of the entire anime series is more than let\u2019s say 30 episodes.\nI\u2019ve seen or have tried to watch a few shonen anime like Dbz, naruto, one piece, bleach, mojo, hunter x hunter. Basically long anime that aren\u2019t shonen, want to see something different.",

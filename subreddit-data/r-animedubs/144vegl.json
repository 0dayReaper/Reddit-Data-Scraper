I don't really know!\n\n*My roommate is a cat / Senryu girl / Tamako Market + Tamako love story / Yona of the dawn / Convenience store boy friends*\n\nExcept the 1st one, the other are romances or have some romance in them, for all you people who would like something to watch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for your input, I hope everyone was able to find at least one anime they haven't seen.\n\nI know I found a few of them.",

I feel like this is one of the GOATs imo but its never really talked about. Easily one of the best isekais out there. The Funimation dub is one of its best and the music is top tier.\n\n**Ping Pong**. This was one of the more controversial anime at its time of release due to its art style. It's intentionally not 'cute', but don't let that stop you, especially if you are a fan of sports anime. Fantastic Funimation dub, and great show overall.\n\n**Megalobox 1 and 2**, ESPECIALLY season 2. Season 1 was great, but season 2 is just top-tier. The MC's character growth from the start of the show to the end of the series is a joy to watch.",

The musical number is sublime. \n\nBlood Blockade Battlefront - More great animation w/ fantastic world building &amp; really likable characters. Such a great, irreverent anime.\n\nMushi-Shi - I'll never pass an opportunity to shill for this chill, atmospheric anime. More people need to see this. Only 1 season is dubbed sadly\n\nLevel E - Wacky alien hijinks. Comedy is subjective but this show had me laughing out loud More than a few times. Has a great heart too.\n\nGaro: The Animation - This show goes to some pretty dark places but is still a really compelling watch. The follow up movie is the best animation you've never seen. I can't overstate just how God-tier that movie's animation is.",

It has fantastic art, whimsical music, a nice ensemble cast, and standalone episodes exploring each character's life. It gave me those warm fuzzy vibes, especially in episode 3.\n\n2. * *Liz and the Blue Bird* - Kyoto Animation's masterpiece of visual storytelling. The movie looks beautiful. Everything is paced rather deliberately, so nothing feels forced. And overall it leaves a touching message about letting go.\n\nI was going to mention an older title *Princess Tutu* and a recent but less known show *The Demon Girl Next Door* (both titles hovering around rank #1300 on MAL's popularity), but after a quick reddit search, I found that these shows are still being discussed on the subreddit! We do a pretty good job elevating less popular shows.",

I know the story is pretty generic, but I loved the aesthetic of the show and felt like the production value was surprisingly good.\n\nThey occasionally pop up on threads like this, but **The Legend of the Legendary Heroes** and **Tokyo Ravens** are both pretty good shows.

Others remember the purple-haired girl with the big bust.\n\nThat show that aired on Fox Kids years ago has been a big inspiration on my writing and deepened my love of fantasy-Not to mention my first anime crush was Prince Eccentro. :)\n\nI love rewatching it even now for research as I'm doing a season 2 fanfic of the show and also nostalgic reasons-I'm also on the sub version I gotta complete. :) \n\nIt's a hidden gem and was the 2000s samurai pizza cats because of the dub, but it has always been close to my heart. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts on bluray for dub and sub",

Great dub too.\n\nI didn\u2019t get into the sequel as much (Dawn of the Witch is the title, I think), but the original story is good.  \n\nI especially liked Mercenary and Zero\u2019s interactions.",

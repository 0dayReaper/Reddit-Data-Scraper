            "comment": "It's EXTREMELY frustrating to see Lupin Zero get shafted with the sub-only release. While it would be convenient to just blame Sentai since they have really sucked this year with dubs, TMS Entertainment USA is likely the actual culprit. That being said, either of them could have funded a dub if the other didn't want to, but for neither of them to dub it is really unfortunate.",

Of course, even if Discotek got this that doesn't mean they would have dubbed themselves it if TMS didn't provide a dub. But it's still strange to see a new Lupin series not get dubbed. Now I wish that Amazon got Lupin Zero and dubbed it with the same crew as Lupin vs Cat's Eye.",

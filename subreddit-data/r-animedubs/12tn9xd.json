    "postText": "The project is about a season away from coming out. Not to open a can of worms, but I am really wondering if they will straight up pretend like it doesn't exist, and not license it even for a sub only release. How big of a poison is this IP currently anway? I see a lot of sentiment from people denouncing the author, but still feeling nostalgic and positive about the series. Is it not one of those cases where one can denounce the author, but still respect the effort that the anime studio, staff and others put into the new project?",

Not only that, this also means there's a chance that Aniplex of America will acquire the full rights to the show and, should it be simuldubbed or simply dubbed at some other point in time after the sub is over, use Bang Zoom to bring back most of the OG cast (yeah yeah I know, the Japanese cast is entirely different, but that doesn't mean the dub has to do the same thing).",

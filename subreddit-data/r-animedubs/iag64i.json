When it does it catches you off guard. It\u2019s still good imo. It\u2019s like when you forget what drink you ordered, &amp; get lemonade expecting sprite. I love the vocal direction they took for Hayasaka. I\u2019m a strong believer that sub/dub haters are just used to things there way, &amp; don\u2019t wanna accept change.",

There's a dissonance between my expectations for how these characters should sound and how they actually do. \n\nFor example, the high-pitch of Kaguya's voice makes her sound too docile to me, whereas I expect her to have a more assertive contralto sound.\n\nAnother example is Shirogane. His VA has a nasally sound, which for some reason I associate with depressed or unmotivated characters. That's the opposite of how he should be described.",

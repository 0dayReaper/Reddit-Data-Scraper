Def getting \"My Bride is a Mermaid\" vibe with this one with the number of times things get turned up to 11 on the crazy scale.\n\nDon't remember the last Sentai dub that had me laughing pretty dang hard the first three eps out the gate. Loving all the characters and performances in this one.\n\nThe cavern part of the ep was def the one that got me laughing the hardest.\n\nI think the only way it could've made me actually die of laughter is we have an Ian Sinclair narrator over commentating everything like *\"These four are running around a dark cavern pretending they're in serious trouble, when they actually are in serious trouble. Sooner or later, batteries are gonna die, hormones are gonna fly, and (probably) Ataru is gonna fry.\"*",

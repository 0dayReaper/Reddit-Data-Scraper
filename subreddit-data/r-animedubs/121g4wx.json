I haven't read the Manga, but a big part of why I like this series is because it gives me the vibes of watching Super-Man grow up into the character everyone loves.\n\nMy head is already dancing with ideas that Year 2 would be a recovery series. Watching the world heal after All-For-One's defeat and the power struggles from other villains trying to take his place. A divide between the old and new and the struggles that would come from that.",

A season and final movie that is pretty much the last 3 episodes makes alot of sense to me. If they insist on not doing one final season\n\n(If they wanted to maximise hype and cash they can make)",

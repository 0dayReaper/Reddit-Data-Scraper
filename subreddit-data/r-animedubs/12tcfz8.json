Kinda sad we only get 11 episodes, though Stone Wars was also the same. Can't imagine they don't adapt the whole manga.",

It\u2019s been one of the most consistent long-running shows in terms of quality I\u2019ve seen in recent memory; I still love it every bit as much as I did all the way back in 2019. \ud83d\ude04",

I love the laughs I've had with it, how it blows my mind with its science and education, and sometimes the feelsy and homey feeling of coming together, or reviving something that was once lost.\n\nI'm exctited for Senkuu and the Science Kingdom's journey to the other side of the world. And plenty of wacky faces, references (Minecraft got my lol'ing), and challenges to be faced. Def high on my list of top favorite shows of this season. This is gonna be a lot of fun!",

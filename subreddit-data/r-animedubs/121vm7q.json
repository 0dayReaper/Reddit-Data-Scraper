            "comment": "Easily one of my all-time favorite MHA episodes.\n\nCongratulations MHA, never in my life have I ever cried from start to finish in a single episode of a show until this one: Deku vs Class 1A.\n\nOnce the flashbacks started showing, once every single one of the 1A declared how much Midoriya has meant to each and every one of them and how he's impacted their lives, I could just not stop. \n\nThis episode wasn't really a fight, it was everyone just reaching out to the one person who has uplifted, inspired, and supported them since day one, who is now need of help the most. Everyone using their evolved quirks, teamwork, and strength to get Deku to stop and accept the help he needs. And just the act of reaching out and showing someone in depression that you're there for them, that they matter to you, it makes a plus-ultra difference. I love Class 1A so much and seeing them go throughout the seasons. Them coming together help Midoriya out is easily my favorite Class 1A moment of all time. These are truely the friends Midoriya deserves and more.\n\nAnd my feelings for Bakugo since ep one has always been on the negative side. But after seeing him be truly honest and vulnerable in front of Midoriya has easily changed any negative feelings I've had with him. God, I love this episode! ANd I loved the job everyone did this episode. Also looking forward to next week's too. That's just as powerful as this one.",

            "comment": "This was absolutely amazing. First let me praise **Justin Briner** for a totally on-point performance as Izuku. You could feel the exhaustion coming off him (showing that he was using Blackwhip to hold himself up was a good touch). \n\nThe entirety of Class 1-A brought their abilities to bear in what was not a fight, but a rescue. \n\nTodoroki gave Izuku the very logic I was saying (that OFA would go after them anyway, so they should stick together). \n\n_You Say Run_ kicking in for the awesome combo move, playing not for Izuku as usual, but for 1-A\u2019s epically heroic action, was absolutely inspired. **J Michael Tatum** delivered as Iida, handing Izuku\u2019s own words of inspiration back to him. \n\nFinally, we get to **Clifford Chapin\u2019s** Bakugo, coming to the top of his character development up to now. It takes a lot of courage to confront ugly truths about yourself, but Bakugo _did_ face it, and came out with true contrition for his treatment of Izuku. He held back nothing, which is massive growth for a character defined by pride. Chapin\u2019s tone was just great for delivering on this moment. \n\nAlso neat: #13 face reveal. I think a lot of viewers thought she was like Kurogiri; some sort of living black hole. Nope; she\u2019s a cute lady. \n\nNext week: It\u2019s **Luci Christian** giving a prime Uraraka moment.\n\nOh, and don\u2019t think we didn\u2019t _notice_ the return of \u201cGo beyond; Plus Ultra!\u201d after a two week absence. Nice subtle touch to show the start of Izuku\u2019s recovery.",

It even got King Explosion Murder God Dynamite to get serious enough to speak his true feelings to Izuku. \n\n Itfelt pretty good when Iida/Ingenium got his shine. His armor and glasses breaking apart from the speed was badass. He was long overdue for a moment.\n\nCrazy to think all that effort was against a worn out Deku. I guess he wasn\u2019t lying at the very beginning of the series lol\n\n\nNo matter what happens in the next two episodes, this episode solidified season 6 as easily the best season of the series so far.",

Would his helmet get destroyed if he wore it during the event?\n\nI love how when Bakugou apologized to Midoriya via showing them growing up, they showed both of them drenched in rain and Midoriya all dirty from kid to present.\n\nBakugou and Iida managing to keep on going despite having Mina's acid going all over their bodies and faces and potentially harming themselves was badass.\n\nI love how 13 unmasked herself to speak to Midoriya as a person instead of a hero.",

Thus ending our Dark Deku Arc of getting our Green Boi Back. I love this Anime so much, see you guys again Next Episode, Emotions are really running Wild.",

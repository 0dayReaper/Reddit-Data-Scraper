The funny and cute moments are better executed in my opinion. That said I do share a frustration that we haven\u2019t gotten progress on Tsukasa\u2019s past (which seems like it\u2019s about to happen), and the constant blushing even though they have been married a while. \n\nI\u2019m also looking forward to the next episode as things look like they\u2019re starting to shape up to explain Tsukasa.",

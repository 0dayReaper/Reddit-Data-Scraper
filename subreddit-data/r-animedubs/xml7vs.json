Apparently, AoA was pretty accepting of the idea and now all of their dubs produced by them are union, at least the ones in LA are. I don\u2019t know how shows like Kaguya-sama and Sk8 the Infinity work.",

If the dub was being handled by Aniplex like Demon Slayer, Lycoris Recoil, Fate and Engage Kiss i'm pretty sure they still use LA VA's and some of their dubs being unionized .",

In any case it explains the radio silence regarding season 2 from Netflix and others. The show airs in less than 24 hours so unless it\u2019s one of the last 3 shows on Crunchyroll\u2019s boxes it seems like it won\u2019t be simulcasted in the west",

Netflix doesn't own all the licenses to they get. Plenty of companies distribute to them. Im not fully concerned, especially since netflix and radio silence is not unheard of.",

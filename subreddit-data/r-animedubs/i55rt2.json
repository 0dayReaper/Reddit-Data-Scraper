But holy hell the sub is almost unwatchable. I couldn't believe it. \n\nI also generally favor good dubs over subs. It's way easier to watch. But I don't mind watching something that's sub only. However, I guarantee I wouldn't like Black Clover as much if I only watched the sub considering I find the MC VA to take things to like...a 13. It's detracting from the storytelling.",

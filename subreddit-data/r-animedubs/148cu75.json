Was this movie not dubbed on a union contract? Between the two, I would argue Black Clover was the bigger show, so I can't imagine Crunchyroll would be more willing to play nice on this than Tower of God considering this had to be the bigger L for them.\n\nEdit: Just for clarification's sake, I am happy they got the Funimatiin cast back. I'm just surprised it actually happened after recent events is all.",

And considering the LA studios more willingness to remote record, specifically TX actors as of late, I feel like it honestly would\u2019ve been more strange if the cast didn\u2019t come back given all that or even more-so if the studio didn\u2019t even try to.\n\nThe Tower of God thing was a whole \u2018nother bowl of Crunchyroll tomfoolery. Even if CR tried that again, Netflix is way bigger of a company for CR to scare them with litigation like they did with that game studio.",

In those two instances, it's been the general understanding that Netflix did not approach the original casts for reprisals. The recent Tower of God thing is definitely because of Crunchyroll, but they own the old Black Clover stuff, too. Netflix getting the cast back is a big step forward for them, but it is very surprising that Crunchyroll didn't pull the same stunt that we had just seen when the circumstances are pretty much the same.",

They'll need a fair buffer before they start airing again, especially if they plan to still be a weekly year round anime.\n\nSo it'll probably be on the shelf for a bit longer still. If not pull a Bleach and only come back after the series is done in a couple years, given this is allegedly the last arc/endgame the manga is getting into.",

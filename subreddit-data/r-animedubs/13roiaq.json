    "postText": "I'm watching the Fire Force dub on Crunchyroll right now and I just started season 2. If Im watching the sub, the on screen text is translated but it's not with the dub. I just ignored it in the first season but it seems like they're including even more in this second season so I'm hoping someone knows a way to fix it.\n\nThe only \"option\" I have is to turn on closed captioning but that doesn't translate the text either...it's just normal closed captioning that shows the words being said. I'm using a fire cube if that make a difference.",

            "comment": "There's no way to translate it sadly, unless you want to watch the sub. This has been an ongoing problem with Crunchyroll for over a year and they still haven't done anything to fix it. Sometimes an episode will have the on screen text translated in the dub but the very next episode won't have it translated....  \n\n\nThe text might be translated if you want to watch the dub on your computer. Sometimes it will show up there but not on any of the apps.",

I don't get why bofuri gets all text on screen translated, and things like future diary don't. It was translated in my blu rays, but not on crunchy the last time I watched it. Been a while tho, but i still see plenty of shows that don't translate text on screen that is literally the most important part of that scene. It's like looking at your friend going thru their phone and they burst out laughing or scream \"oh my god!\" Like I know it must be something, but Idfk, all I see is a dude chuckling at a screen",

            "comment": "Yes there's anime that doesn't have text shown translated on the initial stream.  But then it gets translated with the blu-ray releases.  \n\nLately I've just been avoiding shows that seem like there would be phones used in the story.  And just wait for the blu-ray releases.  Don't know why it's a thing now to include them texting in scenes where they just show the screen and the character doesn't read it.  Just some seemingly random reaction that gives you no context to what's written or sometimes even who the text is from.  Such a contrast from anime a decade ago and older where they painfully hammer in the plot points so no one is unaware of what's going on.  Or maybe I just re-watched Bleach and Naruto too many times.  Endless flashbacks constantly reminding you what happened.\n\nI know there's been several shows but I remember Rent a Girlfriend specifically.  I had to watch the subbed just to know wth the texts said and who was even sending them.  There was a show recently that didn't have text messages but just alot of text on screen that wasn't translated that I watched. I think it was handyman saitou?  I lose track.",

The translation work is already done and the timestamps are set, they just have to extract the applicable parts of it.\n\nI'm really thankful this isn't an issue with blu-ray releases, so for the shows I love and decide to buy, I can eventually rewatch them with proper subtitles.",

I find taking a photo of the text and running through it through Yandex translator is very helpful, as it's usually very good for Japanese. If you have the manga chapter it's based in open in a another tab, that'll have everything translated, which is great if it's a text heavy episode",

            "comment": "I definitely recognize Steve Blum as the narrator heard in the English trailer in *\u014coku* (and hopefully in the anime) as his voice is very distinguishable, which is awesome considering that most of the recent Unionized Anime dubs Steve Blum has been appearing in such as *Baki, Ultraman (2019), Demon Slayer, Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045* and his reprisals in *Boruto* have been either Sh\u014dnen or action-oriented anime titles, so it\u2019s good to see him in a non-action anime series dub.\n\nAlso, heard other voices in the trailer, but can\u2019t put my finger on who\u2019s voicing who including Yoshimune, however I did heard and recognize Cherami Leigh, Yuri Lowenthal and I would assume Crispin Freeman as the other voices in the trailer.\n\nLooks to be either a Studiopolis or a Bang Zoom! dub, since Steve has worked at those studios, mainly the former.\n\n**EDIT:** Checked the SAG-AFTRA database website and it turns out that *\u014coku* is an Iyuno, Los Angeles dub instead of Studiopolis, but good to see Steve Blum getting his feet wet in his first Iyuno, Los Angeles anime dub, and also Iyuno, Los Angeles dubbing more anime outside of the *Pokemon* anime series following *Yakitori* this month.",

Wow. \n\nAs a fan of gender role reversal anything, Ooku has been one of the most well respected manga in that sense, a very serious take on a very serious topic. \n\nWith how it took 16 years for the manga to complete, I keep forgetting that it didn't end *too* long ago, I always think of it as a 2000's manga for that reason and thus never thought it would get an adaptation.",

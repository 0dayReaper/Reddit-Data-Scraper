She's a voice you hear frequently in anime, western cartoons, and video games. Quite frequently in rather popular titles, such as Miraculous Ladybug on Nickelodeon, Fire Emblem and the Trails of Cold Steel games, and anime titles such as the Fate series, Pokemon, and Demon Slayer. Her voice almost reflects her personality: elegant, experienced, and grounded.\n\nOutside of voice acting, she is a vocalist, songwriter, and composer. She also enjoys baking, history, math, hiking, and quantum mechanics (imagine that). She's always trying to find a way to brighten or better others' lives. Whether it be through volunteer or charity work, or even as making us laugh, cry, or feel good with the characters she voices. \n\nWhat are your favorite roles?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Tikki** (Miraculous Ladybug)\n\n\\- **Jade** (Mortal Kombat 11)\n\n\\- **Rachel Alucard** (Blazblue)\n\n\\- **Sharon Kreuger** (Trails of Cold Steel)",

Seriously her performance in Eresh's segment of Grand Carnival was absolutely hilarious)\n\nShe's a ton of fun as Erika of the van gang in Durarara and was delightfully evil as Melascula in Seven Deadly Sins. Also, while I did watch the original series entirely in subbed, I did skim through bits of the dub for Higurashi S1 and she definitely was a solid choice for Rena and pulled off some key scenes well (just a shame the direction and writing really failed her and the rest of the cast)\n\nEDIT: Also, while not anime, her performance in RWBY as Caroline Cordovin is a genuinely great show of her range for a much older character type.",

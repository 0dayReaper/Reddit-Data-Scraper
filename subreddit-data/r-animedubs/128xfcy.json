Oh well.\n\nShoutout to [Ben Balmaceda, Ray Hurd, Jason Liebrecht, Brandon Acosta, and Kevin Thelwell](https://twitter.com/RetroJono/status/1642268949831200769) for their accent work (albeit Julian doesn't talk at all in this episode).",

The one moment where they changed up the groups' reaction of Rin talking to the international players from being impressed with his English to his ballsiness was good, but that line about it being \"hard to make out what they're saying due to the accents and distance??\" Yeah... would have sounded a lot more natural to just not call such direct attention to it at all/be more vague. \n\nAlso some of the accent work here was *very* hit or miss based on the little we heard, but I guess that's to be expected when having to get locals in-studio on a quick simuldub turnaround.",

Now that she's facing her mortality and has been kicked to the curb by her pimp boyfriend, she goes looking for her emotional support Miri to feel sad about herself.\n\nOn the other hand, Miri seems to have nothing but love and kisses for the mom. Miri also loves those TV dinner hamburg steaks, even though Kazuki makes better food with superior ingredients. That usually implies that Miri associates the food with good memories, and her biases her towards that food, which in turn implies that her life with mom was actually happy.\n\nI honestly don't know what to think right now.",

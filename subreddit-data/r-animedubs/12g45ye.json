            "comment": "I think i was hoping for this show to be a little similar to Bookworm side. Sadly, pacing for Saving 80000\u2019s was a little on the fast side. Wished they took their time with things, and having Mitsuha find clever ways to introduce modern day products or solutions without having it be an easy fix for all the problems. \n\nBut its not all too bad. Mitsuha was probably my favorite part of the show. She\u2019s such a fun, charming, and enthusiastic character. Never got bored with her. \n\nOverall, i was really excited at the start, but ended up just a tad disappointed at the finale. When it was fun, it was fun. Just not as consistent or well paced as I\u2019d like it to be",

I really liked the low-stakes fun of the first half of the show a lot better than the final few episodes, but it ended on a great note. And they did a great job ending on a satisfactory note while leaving it in a great place for season 2 if it gets one.",

There's still a whole second half of volume 2 that was not adapted (and volume 1 and 2 are already in English)\n\nI feel like this doesn't have a good chance for a second season though. They sold the entire season as one bluray set when most anime are split into volumes (to get more sales). And they released almost no official merch. When those things are normally what's used to fund future seasons\n\nI can still hope though hah",

I guess technically I'm wrong since that's an AT4 recoilless gun, not an RPG.\n\nI'll admit I was suckered in by the pretty good gun handling, but stayed for the capitalism shenanigans. And the times she did actually use her pew pews it was well done.\n\nOverall a fun show. I wish there had been more Gate moments, but I'm weird like that.\n\nI'd watch a second season.",

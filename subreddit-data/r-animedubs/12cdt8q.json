    "postText": "When the Blood War anime finally got announced all I wanted was for the entire dub cast to return I was fully expecting Vic to get recast but was hoping that by some divine miracle that he would return as Ikaku first it was Chad because of \"representation\" (which has me worried that Yoruichi will also get recast for that same reason which I hope not cause Wendee Lee is perfect) then it was Ryuken and half the captains then there was David who said he was more than happy to return as Kenpachi even for lower paid for the fans but Viz refused to call the man. I heard that apparently its because the dub was non union and I guess most of these VAs only work on union projects but can anyone confirm this? Honestly I'm just glad none of my favorite characters got recast.",

All things considered, I'm a little surprised at some of the people who *did* return.    \n    \nIn the case of David, he's the one who decided to leave the show years ago. He may have wanted to come back now, but Viz probably didn't want him back after that.",

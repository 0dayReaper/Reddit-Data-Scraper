They intentionally dont end the story so you need to buy whatever their pushing.\n\nTypically anime isnt made for art or entertainment and the viewership itself is simply not how japan makes money. They make money exporting anime merchandise.\n\nMany better anime were sleeper hits like sao, which was unplanned i think at that time or anime original. Meaning their is nothing to sell so the story can end. Those are pretty rare these days however.\n\nAnime isnt generally made like american tv where they are selling commerical time. Of cours streaming changes everything but crunchy roll subs are not howw japan makes money. selling millions of dollars of anime merch however...",

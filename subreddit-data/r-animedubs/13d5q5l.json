He's moved around a lot, traveling a long way before becoming a voice actor. He spent the first two years of his life in Vietnam before moving to France at the age of three, and then Switzerland right after for a few years. His first two languages were Vietnamese and French, and learned English when he and his family move to Singapore.). Khoi immigrated to the US at the age of 16.\n\nKhoi is a huge weeb, and was going to study video game design until he got a taste of voice acting in the booth, and has fallen in love with it ever since. And in just a couple of years has been in quite a lot of anime and video games, even helping directing and scripting for some eps as well. He's got a young protag-kun kind of voice about him.\n\nAnd He still is a big weeb, loves video games, memes,  and cats.\n\nWhat are your Favorite Roles?\n\n\\- **Tetsuya Kuroko** (Kuroko's Basketball)\n\n\\- **Keiichi Maebara** (Higurashi When They Cry)\n\n\\- **Iskahn** (Sword Art Online Alicization- War of Underworld)",

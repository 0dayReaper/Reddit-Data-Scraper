I'm really excited to hear Alex Organ, Natalie Van Sistine, and Megan Shipman in their respective roles.\r  \n\r  \nI've really enjoyed what Cris George has done on the director side as of recent (Uramichi-oniisan, Wonder Egg Priority). And Tyler Walker is one of my favorite Script Adapters. I believe they'll do great work with this.",

I guess if there's one title to make the dub so close to the sub it's this one.\n\nThat being said the fact that this is a Texas dub (which explains the quick turnaround time) speaks VOLUMES. The VAs weren't messing around when they said Crunchyroll wanted to focus more on Texas dubs, I do not expect a single non-sequel to get dubbed (or at least simuldubbed) in LA if Spy x Family isn't.",

As for the ones such as Sound Cadence, Okratron 5000 and Kocha Sound, CR would very much likely do so.",

I agree with this.\n\n[We had a whole thread dedicated to this issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/comments/tzwkul/brittany_lauda_on_twitter_vo_remotework_options/?sort=confidence). And one of the points that came up was that with the return of in-studio recording, and that nearly EVERYTHING except returning shows are gonna be done in TX, it could suck for LA VAs or international VAs who have taken advantage of remote recording during the pandemic. And as a result, this season might see less variety in shows.",

Sony owned funimation, and acquired crunchyroll. And crunchyroll didn\u2019t really have a lot of resources on its own that they got from buying them, they outsourced pretty much everything \n\nThat\u2019s the reason this is happening sooner than later, because new crunchyroll is actually old funimation, which is a dubbing studio.\n\nMake no mistake, new crunchyroll is going to largely be funimation wearing crunchyrolls brand as a mask",

Operating as Westalis' master spy, Twilight works tirelessly to prevent extremists from sparking a war with neighboring country Ostania. For his latest mission, he must investigate Ostanian politician Donovan Desmond by infiltrating his son's school: the prestigious Eden Academy. Thus, the agent faces the most difficult task of his career: get married, have a child, and play family.\n\nTwilight, or \"Loid Forger,\" quickly adopts the unassuming orphan Anya to play the role of a six-year-old daughter and prospective Eden Academy student. For a wife, he comes across Yor Briar, an absent-minded office worker who needs a pretend partner of her own to impress her friends. However, Loid is not the only one with a hidden nature. Yor moonlights as the lethal assassin \"Thorn Princess.\" For her, marrying Loid creates the perfect cover. Meanwhile, Anya is not the ordinary girl she appears to be; she is an esper, the product of secret experiments that allow her to read minds. Although she uncovers their true identities, Anya is thrilled that her new parents are cool secret agents! She would never tell them, of course. That would ruin the fun.\n\nUnder the guise of \"The Forgers,\" the spy, the assassin, and the esper must act as a family while carrying out their own agendas. Although these liars and misfits are only playing parts, they soon find that family is about far more than blood relations.",

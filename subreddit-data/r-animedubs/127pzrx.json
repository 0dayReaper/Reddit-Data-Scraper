Old or new, as long as it's dubbed we'd like to hear about it. \n\nAnything good we should look out for? Anything bad we should try to avoid? Tell us a little bit of what you think. It's nice if you elaborate a bit on what it is you like or don't like about a show. That way your comment is useful to people who are looking for new anime to watch. :)\n\nWriting the names of the anime in **bold** is nice, to make it easier for people skimming the thread to pick out the names.\n\nSince this is also for people who are looking for new shows to watch, please use the spoilertag if you reveal any mayor plot points of the anime you are discussing (see spoilertag section in the sidebar for info on how).\n\n\nTo prevent low effort comments to steal the spotlight from people who put in a little bit more effort **top level comments in this thread must be at least 150 characters long** (roughly 3 sentences long).\n\n\n[You can find a list of the previous \"Your week in anime dubs\" posts here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/search/?q=author%3AAutoModerator+AND+title%3AYour+week+in+anime+dubs&amp;sort=new)",

I have to say that, from a storytelling perspective, it was lackluster. Or rather, it didn't follow a story path in a traditional manner. Furthermore, it almost completely eschewed any semblance of comedy, which is a pretty rare sight in the anime realm.\n\nInstead, I see this series as a character study, showcasing the MC's growth as he's influenced by the people around him. And in that respect, it worked quite well. Plus I found the educational component about drawing and painting rather fascinating, despite not having an artistic bone in my body. Especially Yaguchi's thought process as he tried to come up with inventive solutions in his two entrance exams had me fully engaged (I always enjoy content like that, a prime example being *Skip Beat!*).",

Some of the localization stuff is decent for what they had to work with. But really looking forward to watching the rest. **Aleks Le** (who I think is having an excellent start to the 2023 season), **Feodore Chin**, and **Jenny Yokobori** are all great.",

            "comment": "Well, finished **Tomo-chan**. &gt;!It is just not for me. I found myself more angry and disappointed than happy most of the time, with only Carol and Masculine Tomo getting me through each week. Tomboys are rare, and I love seeing them, so it hurts how much I just can't stand this show half the time. It being an actual simuldub pains me even more.!&lt; 5/10\n\n**Handyman Saito:** &gt;!I am unamused by the big action turn this anime took compared to the manga. Way more dramatic and intensity in my comfy mundane sol isekai comedy. Doesn't help that the fights are padded to hell and back and the lack of on screen subtitles for the text makes me wonder why I even bother with the dub. On the plus side, the main 4 are real fun and most of the cutaways to other people are good... except the shadow ninja witch romance, which I didn't like in the manga either, but it feels even worse here due to how many episodes focus on them.!&lt; 6/10\n\n**Bofuri S2:** &gt;!Maple Syrup and Sally are cute and fun, but I just cannot get into anyone else. Not even redhead Rimaru can get me to care. With a focus on the larger group and the fast pace in floor content it just isn't as good as S1. Still good, especially on episodes with just those 3.!&lt; 7/10\n\n**NieR Automata:** &gt;!To be honest, I prolly shouldn't be watching this as I never played any of the games, and reading the Tv Tropes page made me even more confused, but it is nice to look at and interesting. Hopefully I can follow along somehow.!&lt; too early/10\n\n**The Eminence in Shadow:** &gt;!By far the best ongoing dubbed anime  and one of the best ones of recent seasons period. I have very few complaints, mostly the lack of ASMR in the Atomic scenes in the dub, and a few jokes that weren't pulled off as good as the manga. Besides that, it is fucking amazing and is the one I am so, soooo glad that people are understanding how great it is.!&lt; 8/10 but can go higher.",

Good ending too. \n\n**Seraph of the end** was worried about this one because it\u2019s labeled as horror, but so far this is good and I\u2019m not freaking out as I would think I would with horror. It\u2019s got a blue exorcist feel but a little darker. I\u2019m enjoying it a lot.",

It's mostly just something to scratch the itch while I'm waiting for new episodes of **Nagatoro**, **Ice Guy** and **Buddy Daddies** to come out, all of which I like a fair bit better. It's about a Karuta club and the relationship between 3 childhood friends who bonded over playing the game. I think my main complaint is just that it's kind of slow. I do like that it gives a lot of respect and attention to the details of the game, though.",

            "comment": "**Appare-Ranman** - Another one that I was able to watch free on Funimation. I was looking for something to fill the void left by Buddy Daddies, and realized about halfway through that both were made by the same studio! It had a fun mix of action and comedy which is just what I wanted, and a likeable cast of characters with distinct personalities and motivations. The slightly sci-fi inspired early American setting was unique, and the race itself at the center of the story was very exciting. The reason behind the villain's goal was a bit one-dimensional, but I liked the way they handled the reveals leading up to it and it did present a good challenge that allowed each of the main characters to play a role. I could only watch the first two episodes dubbed - I thought Appare's voice sounded too deep, but most of the characters' voices fit them well. **Rating: 9/10**\n\n**Legend of Korra season 1** - My favorite season, basically a perfect sequel to Avatar in my opinion. The new Team Avatar and villains are great, pro-bending is really fun to watch, and I liked how the story explored how the world evolved in both positive and negative ways in the ~70 years since the original series. It also works well as a standalone season. **Rating: 10/10**\n\nI started watching **Iroduku: The World in Colors** yesterday as well, which has been on my list for a long time (and I can finally watch it now that I have HiDive). As it turns out, it's another show from PA Works like Buddy Daddies and Appare-Ranman. I've only watched the first three episodes so far, but I'm enjoying it. The lead character and her group of friends all seem nice, and it's always great to see an anime where the kids have kind, supportive families. The use of color is really beautiful, and I like the animation style used for Yuito's artwork.\n\nAlso watching **Sword Art Online: War of Underworld** again on my VHS tapes (showing my age here) because it's my favorite, and I miss being able to watch a scene or two whenever I want since Crunchyroll's been down. \ud83d\ude04",

Also, Wendee Lee Conan &gt; Alison Viktorin Conan. Alison's Conan sounds a bit *too* childish for me whrease Wendee's Conan sounds closer to his Japanese voice.\n\nWeekly dubs I'm currently watching\n\n* Nier Automata ver1.1\n* Tokyo Revengers Christmas Showdown arc\n* Sugar Apple Fairy Tale  \n* Saving 80k Gold for My Retirement \n* Handyman Saito (Surprisingly good)\n* Ningen Fushin",

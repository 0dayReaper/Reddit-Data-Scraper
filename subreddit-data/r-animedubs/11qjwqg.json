At least with the Daman Mills case, it only took about a week before the matter was settled with Daman's accuser retracting his statements and admitting to fabricating the evidence. Not saying anything at all about Mike is still weird to me. The whole \"dragging their brand down\" stuff shouldn't mean shit by now.",

Other than drag them into a domestic / sexual abuse allegations case. I dont get this whole they need to make a statement? Sub out for a moment VA for computer tech at reddit accused for the same shit, you expect reddit to release a statement, dont like computer tech try warehouse employee for Amazon etc. VA's aren't some special case there just contract workers at the end of the day.\n\nAgain I say this publicly all that exists are Avery's allegations (Which I support), he hasnt been charged and again **NOT EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE PUBLIC EYE** for every random person to chime in with there takes cause thats all a public statement will do.\n\nWe have no idea what type of internal checks or systems either Crunchyroll or HIDIVE have when it comes to this, they could be conducting there own investigation's or what could be happening behind the scene etc. cause its truly not our business to know how HR in Crunchyroll or HIDIVE works come on and at the end of the day the % of fans that are this engaged is dwarfed by those that likely dont even know who is voicing X character / dont give a fuck about the behind the scenes of there dubs.",

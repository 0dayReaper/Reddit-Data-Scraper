Also, here's [a comment in my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/comments/pgn7uj/list_of_59_dubbed_shows_for_isekai_lovers/iovroig) where I also list 29 newer shows I didn't have in the original post. Literally nearly every one of those newer shows has an OP MC with the exceptions of Executioner and Her Way of Life, Thermae Romae Novae, I'm the Villainness, Handyman Saitou, and Adventurers Who Don't Believe in Humanity.\n\nIt has them ranked by my preference, along with categories(you might be interested in Fantasy), a description and short review for each show, episode counts, and links to MAL.",

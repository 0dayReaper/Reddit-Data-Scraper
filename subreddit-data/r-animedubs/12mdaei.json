The only explanation I can come up with for how something this bad was written is that the writers all died in a car accident on the first day, and they couldn't afford new ones so they just brought in a bunch of 1st graders to make the scripts.",

Once Karen was reunited with Seiichi, everything went off the rails and just went stupid and not fun.\n\nI am curious what that seed was that went into the ground where Destra died, but I'm also not really invested enough to really want to see more.",

It fell into the classic \"dumb comedy\" trap of \"oh actually it's nearing the end so it has to be all dramatic and cool now,\" and then completely failing the delivery. Because duh. Seen it once, seen it a thousand times. And I've seen it dozens, at least. Feel like I need to go watch an actually good comedy isekai now, like a palette cleanser XD",

Season 2 was... all over the place. Honestly, if they had sliced out 5 episodes worth of fluff and filler, it would have felt much better.\n\nThe happy ending for everyone felt like and ass pull, but at this point I couldn't even care.\n\nSays something that I still like this better than Iceblade.",

That was without a doubt, one of the worst slapped together second seasons I have ever seen. I thought we\u2019d get more interactions with the classmates, a redemption arc proving them wrong. NOPE. we got the creepy sniffing friend confirming that Seiichi smells like shit even after the glow up. Why even make a second season. How did that possibly get the green light?",

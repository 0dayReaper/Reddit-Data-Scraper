Perfectly sweet and funny romance with really good energy and a pretty good dub (Sarah Wiedenheft in particular absolutely crushes it). 13 episodes with a great cast of characters and more romance plotlines than you can shake a stick at (pretty much all of which have their own merits).\n\n**Toradora** is another one that would be in close contention for the #1 spot too.\n\nOther honorable mentions (all 9s from me):\n\n* **Gosick**\n* **Dusk Maiden of Amnesia**\n* **Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions**\n* **Horimiya**\n* **A Lull in the Sea**\n* **Say \"I Love You**\n* **More than a Married Couple, but Not Lovers**\n* **Your Lie in April**\n* **Just Because!**\n* **Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches**\n* **Chivalry of a Failed Knight**\n* **Gamers**\n* **My First Girlfriend is a Gal**\n* **Domestic Girlfriend**\n* **O Maidens in Your Savage Season**\n* **OreGairu**\n\n\nAnd I'm now just realizing how ridiculously many of my 9s are Romance shows. Damn.\n\nEdit: Formatting",

This is based on the light novel reading not the Japanese voices. Yet I also imagine her voice is sweet and gentle at times. She also needs to have an edge when serious and upset. I was think at first maybe Luci Christian, Alexis Tipton or Jad Saxton.\n\n After listening to her demo I think Felicia Angelle would be the best fit. It seems to check off all the boxes. For Amane I was looking it up and thought of someone not heard in awhile Stephen Sanders. I just think of his voice as Kotarou from Tsukigakirei is the perfect fit. If not Josh Grelle jumps to mind. Serious, but can have an edge while lacking confidence. \n\nAs for Itsuki and Chitose they seem energetic. I just imagine Clifford Chapin, and Sarah Wiedenheft fit the bill. For the rest I not even going to guess it took a lot of effort for those four. Though to be fair I really only left out Amane's parents and Yuuta they all seem to have serious yet joking sides as well. There are plenty of people who voice parents like that in Anime to choose from. Yuuta seems to be skies the limit to choose for him as well.",

I do not know if you have read the light novels, but there are 5 volumes out in print in English. 4 and 5 do go past the anime. I know the author has written 7 or 8 volumes as of now.

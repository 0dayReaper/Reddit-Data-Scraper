I think she was MIA for a while, so I was a bit worried about her being recast, but her most recent work in Bluelock and Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System definitely assured me that she was coming back for this show.\n\nOh and that's definitely Clifford Chapin as the hentai protagonist-looking dude. \ud83d\udc80",

However, for the 99th sacrifice, the human girl brought to the capital, Sariphi, intrigues the Beast King.*  \n*In fact, she isn't afraid of him or any other beast and even accepts her death without begging or crying, as she has neither home nor family to return to if she were released. The King finds her intriguing and let her stay at his side as his consort despite being human. This is the story of how Sariphi will become the queen of demons and beasts.*",

            "comment": "Really like the casting right off the bat, and since I've been trying to evenly split up my subbed and dubbed seasonals since there's just SO many shows, I think this is one I'm definitely going to switch to the dub. I also have only seen one of director Jonathan Rigg's dubs (in a very different genre no less), so it'll be fun to get a feel for how he tackles this type of show!\n\nEmi Lo has been on a roll for a good while now and I had zero doubts going in that she would nail this sort of \"soft but still feisty\" type of female lead. I knew Ray Hurd mostly from One Piece, but even just on paper I thought he would fit this archetype so well. Instantly got classic theatrical *Beast &amp; the Beast* vibes from his tone and cadence, not to mention the more archetypal, comedic voices of the supporting cast that really help sell the fantasy world. I will say when it came towards the end of the episode, I did expect more of a divide between his beast and human forms, but I suppose they didn't want it to be too jarring (it's a tricky balance for sure). I think it works, but it will take a bit of time getting used to that much deeper register with that character design haha.\n\nLooking forward to more - I've heard good things about the manga and with this being a two-cour show, I imagine they're going to do their best to cover those 15 volumes in that span of time.",

            "comment": "The show is wonderfully cast. Loved what I'm hearing with Emi and Ray the first episode. Def feeling some reverse Fruits Baskets vibe with Sariphi and Leonhart. Like Sariphi is adorable, almost like Tohru Honda light, and Leonhart has a Yuki Soma kind of patience and regalness to him. Plus, you get tender and intimate moments, and the next, Sariphi has got those cute anime faces.\n\nI'm curious to see where this is gonna go. I do see this going the romantic route, and if done right can be a really touching, feelsy show. I also think they could spend some eps bettering the relationship between beasts and humans, and some interesting drama can be done with that.\n\nAll and all, I'm liking the first ep, and will def check next week for the next one.",

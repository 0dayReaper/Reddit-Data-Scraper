I'd be floored if it isn't one of the next shows in line for dub.  \n\n\nAnd in defense of their \"past mistakes\" - Higurashi did pretty terribly in it's initial run.  It only really became popular over time and became a bit of a cult hit - pretty much after Funi abandoned it to sentai lol.",

So it's quite the change of pace for them to licence this brand new show &amp; promote it so heavily.\n\nGranted that all happened nearly a decade ago or so and things just change in that time, from the people running Funimation to the customer base they rely on.\n\nhttps://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2011/06/11-1/funimation-we-will-never-license-any-sequels-to-higurashi-no-naku-koro-ni",

The show did such a great job of balancing literal dick jokes with real, heartfelt emotional moments for a nice blend of humor and tension.\n\nI hope it gets another season someday.",

The entire cast coming to see Saitou and reminding him how valued he is, compared to his old life on earth, was kind of heartwarming. Good epilogue/cooldown episode after last week's battle.\n\nThis was a really good show. The first episode made me think it would be farcical animated shitpost, but it turned out to have really good action and actual well written drama. The comedy was genuinely funny. The characters, even the secondary characters, were all memorable and interesting.",

Great work all around. I def feel that this show may have flown under some people\u2019s radar. Would def watch another season if it gets another.",

The only thing I could have found better was that the anime is episodic, but anyway, the anime did follow a somewhat clear story. The story was good, packed with a lot of comedy and some dirty jokes that actually were more funny than disgusting and good animation to top it off.\n\nI hope this one gets a new season soon, I need more of this anime!\n\nOne of my favorites this season, for sure. For me, this anime is about an 8.5.",

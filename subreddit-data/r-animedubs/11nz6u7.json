            "comment": "Sounds like Prince Olivert and Chancellor Osborne got hit with the recast bat, too. Lmao. So far the only reprisals we've gotten are Zach Aguilar as Campanella and DC Douglas as Rufus Albarea. Nice job Crunchyroll.\n\nLooks like empire is doing false-flag operations and using them as pretenses for annexation. Par for the course for Erebonia. Meanwhile Orobouros is playing Clark like a puppet. Well, until he died. \n\nMinor continuity error. Early in the episode they talked about Erebonia's failed invasion of Liberl, and showed a shot of some characters from that arc. In the far right you see Joshua (black-haired guy with twin swords). In that shot he's wearing his outfit from after the events in question.",

This anime must have been once anticipated but now this is happening, the director Austin Sisk and Okratron must have been so confident of  announcing the Legacy Cast of the video game voice actors returning to play their roles but jinx, they get recasted.",

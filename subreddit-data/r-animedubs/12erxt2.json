            "comment": "Oh wow, quite the surprise that Crunchyroll got the license of Season 2 for *Eden\u2019s Zero* after the radio silence of Netflix not getting Season 2, despite licensing Season 1 of the show. Hard to say what happened that led to Netflix not getting Season 2 of *Eden\u2019s Zero,* but this isn\u2019t the first time that Netflix licensed something only for them to not licensed the next series or the next season considering that Netflix didn\u2019t license Season 3 of *Teasing Master Takagi-San* despite licensing Season 2 as that went to Sentai instead.\n\nGoing to be interesting how the outcome of the dub will be like now that Crunchyroll has the license to Season 2 of Eden\u2019s Zero either:\n\n* Crunchroll outsources Season 2 of *Edens Zero* to Bang Zoom! to maintain continuity of the voice cast, only that it will be non-Union dub resulting in some actors (except for the TX based actors like Tia Ballard, Colleen Clinkenbeard, Rob McCollum etc.) being recast.\n\n**OR**\n\n* Crunchyroll pulls a \"Megalo Box 2\" and \"Mob Psycho III\u201d and have Season 2 of *Edens Zero* be dubbed in-house in Dallas thus having in some of the LA actors who were involved in the first season to not return and be recast with TX based voice actors.\n\nLastly, I\u2019m also more curious how this would affect the Latin American dub of *Edens Zero* considering that the series was recorded in Chile while the vast majority of the anime series licensed by Crunchyroll are dubbed in Mexico, so will it switch over to Mexico?!?",

I have to wonder why though. I fully expect S2 to get dubbed but I do wonder if S2 is going to be a union dub like the first season.",

                            "comment": "&gt; Netflix seem to be cutting back on their anime investment.\n\nTbh, Netflix since late 2021 has been drifting away from licensing new anime titles and are more interested in creating and commissioning their own original anime (e.g. *Bastard!, Romantic Killer, exception, Kotaro Live Alone, Junji Ito Maniac, Pluto, Akuma-Kun, Yakitori: Soldiers of Misfortune, Ooku, Onmyoji, Gamera-Rebirth* etc.) and Anime-Style animated series (e.g. *Castlevania, The Witcher, Trese, Master of the Universe: Revelation, Kong: Skull Island,* etc.) for their streaming service lately rather than picking up/licensing specific new anime series than in previous years (2018-2021) which would explain why FUNimation/Crunchyroll and Sentai have licensed the bulk of the anime series from the Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall 2022 Seasons and now the Winter and Spring 2023 seasons respectively.\n\nGranted Netflix did licensed *Uncle from Another World* along with *Detective Conan: Zero Tea Time* and *Detective Conan: The Culprit Hanzawa* respectively back in 2022, and Netflix recently licensed *My Happy Marriage* for the Summer 2023 season but the amount of anime licenses from 2022-2023 as of now is far less to the 5-6 anime licenses that Netflix licensed from 2018-2021.\n\nI guess the likely reasons why Netflix didn't even bother licensing _URUSEI Yatsura_ and several other anime titles (e.g. *Chainsaw Man, Blue Lock, Tokyo Mew, Mew,* etc.) and Season 2 of *Eden\u2019s Zero* is either:\n\n* The anime production committee for this particular anime series and many others had a much higher pricing bid leading to Netflix dropping out and Sentai and/or Crunchyroll swooping in.\n* Netflix not being interested in licensing those anime titles despite the huge appeal and would rather just focus on creating their own anime originals, resulting in Crunchyroll or Sentai licensing them instead.\n* Sentai and/or Crunchyroll had license the particular anime series months ahead of time.\n* Season 1 of *Eden\u2019s Zero* didn\u2019t perform as well as Netflix hoped and decided not to license Season 2, similar to what happened with Season 3 of *Teasing Master Takagi-San* when Sentai license that season instead of Netflix despite Netflix licensing Season 2 of *Takagi-San*\n\nAnother factor for Netflix not licensing as much anime in previous years has to do with FUNImation being absorbed into Crunchyroll in March of 2022 and also AMC acquiring Sentai Filmworks in January of 2022 which caused a ripple effect on Anime licensing, hence why Netflix hasn\u2019t been licensing as much anime like in the past 3-5 years.",

Big fan of Mashima\u2019s Work\n\nHowever, This still brings in one concern towards me, The First Season was of course Union thanks to Netflix\u2019s Magic but now they lost and couldn\u2019t get the rights to Season 2 and now Crunchyroll hold the dubbing rights to it. I mean I definitely Know Bang Zoom will dub the Anime again and it\u2019s original cast will stay of course, but at the cost of losing its Union Magic. I mean I know the Anime is Not Aniplex but it could still be union, in a similar way of like how Yashahime was?",

Who else do you think may or may not come back, I\u2019m wondering about Janice Kawaye, she didn\u2019t returned to play Yuzu in Bleach TYBW, don\u2019t know if it was scheduling or she went full Union, she\u2019s hardly been in dubs, and most of them she\u2019s recently been in are Union.",

Beyond like, a Suzume situation where potential award campaigning has to be considered.",

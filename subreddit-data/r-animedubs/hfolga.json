Kyoto animation almost always has movies for their shows that are dubbed, get dubbed.  \n\n\nAlso encouraging is that neflix is in on it so they will likely dub.",

I watched an episode but it just wasn't what I was looking for at the time (although the animation was incredible.  But I expect nothing less from Kyoto Animation - always top tier on style - even their older stuff still looks like it could be made today and looks BETTER than much of the newer stuff.) - But I'll go back and check it out at some point for sure.",

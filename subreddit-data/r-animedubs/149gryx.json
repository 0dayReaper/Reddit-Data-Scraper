However, for the 99th sacrifice, the human girl brought to the capital, Sariphi, intrigues the Beast King.*  \n*In fact, she isn't afraid of him or any other beast and even accepts her death without begging or crying, as she has neither home nor family to return to if she were released. The King finds her intriguing and let her stay at his side as his consort despite being human. This is the story of how Sariphi will become the queen of demons and beasts.*",

Easily the lowest and most fearful moment of his days before he became a warrior. Though I dont condone some of the stuff he\u2019s done, at least I felt he was a real character fighting for both Ilia as well as for himself. \n\nExcellent work by Cliff and Emi this ep.",

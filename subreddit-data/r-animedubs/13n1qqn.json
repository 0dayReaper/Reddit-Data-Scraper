I just scrolled through MAL's lists of shows from Spring 2022 to this year just to make sure and\u2026 wow.\n\nThe only LGBT show I can think of that was dubbed by Crunchyroll last year was Given, and even then, that was a backlog dub because the show originally came out in 2019. I don't think they've simuldubbed like\u2026 any LGBT show recently now that you mention it.\n\nNot to mention, while yuri is not the main focus of Dead Mount Death Play at all, they removed the lesbian sex scene from chapter 5 (which should've been in episode 3) and censored some other fanservice moments (even though it's based on a seinen manga and not a shonen one), and someone on an MAL thread for the show pointed the finger at Crunchyroll because they are literally on the production committee for it.\n\nSomething's definitely not right here\u2026",

Since we're seeing NetEase, Tencent and Bilibili claw their way into production committees, that means the Japanese companies are required to satisfy their demands too unfortunately.",

I can't believe Crunchyroll has a ridiculous fetish for isekais and dubbing most of them smh. They need to get and dub more romcoms, because they already missed really good ones like Angel Next Door, Magical Revolution and now Skip and Loafer.",

Absolute trainwreck that I've read three times and managed to pull myself off permanently.  \n\n\nI've heard ok things about the Survive with Potion series, it's affectionately referred to as Potion Loli on J-Novel.  \n\n\nAside from that, the rest don't interest me much. May check out the Otome one despite Villainess/Otome stuff not being of real interest to me. The yuri angle might be enough to at least make me take a look. Horimiya got my goat real bad with the manga, though I guess I understand because of cultural differences.",

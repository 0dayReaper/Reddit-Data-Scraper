Berserk has a legacy, sure, but considering the previous CGI shows were received so poorly, it probably lowered expectations. Considering that, Konosuba is a way more popular title than those examples by today's standards, so they want it dubbed immediately rather than later. Meanwhile, if there's no rush, it's easier to outsource the dub and maintain consistency.",

Though she\u2019s done plenty if both Simuldub and non-union roles (Fire Emblem, Isekai Quartet, etc).",

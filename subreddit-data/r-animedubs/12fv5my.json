            "comment": "MHA is my all time favorite anime shows. Season 6 I think may be tied with my favorite season of MHA. Simply because of how while my other favorite gave me the highest of happy feels, this one has made me the most emotional I've ever watched it. And it was so good. From the high stakes, high drama, high body count, and quality animation of the first half of S6, to the downtrodden, most emotionally breaking, depressed low points, and sprikled with a founding love and support in the final eps. I could not ask for anything more. And the best part, I feel the characters in this show have shown a lot more human and relateable aspects about themselves than previous seasons before.\n\nDef feel that this season has brought out some great voice acting work I've heard. From Newton Pittman, Patrick Seitz, E. Jason Liebrecht, Eric Vale, Justin Briner, Luci Christian, and more. It was something that I hope all of them can be incredibly proud of.\n\nIts not fair that the 2nd cour of MHA easily takes my favorite anime for Winter 2023, but I'm so glad that MHA has given me more and more reasons to be a super hero medium piece to treasure in my heart forever. After that tidal wave and recovery of S6, I now feel a lot more hopeful and optimistic about these heroes than I was when the season started. I'm so excited for S7.",

This was without a doubt the best season of the series imo. Not to mention the second cour OP/ED combo was perfect and just added to the feels.\n\nMaybe it was just me but as great as it was, this was the only season where I didn\u2019t see a lot of social media hype/spoilers like in past seasons.\n\nShoutout to the all-star cast too. They did an amazing job as usual during this emotional season.\n \nMight be biased because I really love My Hero but when this series is all said and done, I think it\u2019ll be at least Top 5 Shounen of all time",

If this upcoming season isn\u2019t the last, then maybe we\u2019ll get a movie or shorter S8.\n\n\n\n\nSame though. Once Horikoshi gets a much deserved break, I hope we get a sequel with them as adults. There is a spin off called Vigilantes that\u2019s set 5 years before the series I believe, and from what I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s quite good.",

Hearing Bakugo calling him Izuku again, That\u2019s is so much character development. And Rob McCollum is still just as menacing and freighting as the Hero Killer Stain, but he\u2019d show All Might that their is still hope and more new information on the Villains. Also really loving the Voice of Star and Stripe. \n\nAnd without further ado, Goodbye MHA, watching it again was Blast, and I only know that likely next year, things are going to accelerated even further, See you guys again at Season 7 (which is possibly said to be the Final Season?) either way, Let\u2019s all keep Running, towards the Future, Go Beyond, Plus Ultra!!! :)",

That being said here\u2019s what I think, the \u201cFinal\u201d Season 7 would have 3 cours, consisting of 38 episodes, a way to end the Anime. Adding up to this, the first season only had 13 episodes and season 2 to 6 all had 25 episodes. Seems like a long and fitting way to end the anime and have more time to enjoy it longer while it last like Attack on Titan.",

Manga is currently only on 384.\n\nId say its either season 7 or season 8. If Season 7 could possible end up a bit longer than seasons 2-6 (Like how the final 2 Dragon Ball Volumes are noticeable longer than all the others) then i see it as doable.\n\nUnless something crazy happens, id say its either season 7 or season 8.\n\nIMO The problem with a potential season 8 is that im not sure where the hell they would stop season 7, without having a massive cliffhanger.",

Lots of things going on, not much in the way of clean breaks for a season ender.\n\nUnless they up and pull a naruto (final battle lasted like 7 chapters lol), then the next season is either gonna be very long or end on a cliffhanger.\n\n...very short is also an option i suppose.",

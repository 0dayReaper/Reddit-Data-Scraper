            "comment": "The middle brother got hit by the character development bat really hard.\n\nNot only is he much less of a shit, he's also smarter and less impulsive. The brief fight against Amyu was great for showing that. Not only was he smart enough to use trickery against Amyu, he was smart enough to realize that Amyu was the better fighter and that his trick wouldn't work a second time. He also chilled out enough not to fight her again against his better judgment.\n\nWe're ten episodes in and to this day every time I hear that stupid fox talk I can't help but think Jahy.",

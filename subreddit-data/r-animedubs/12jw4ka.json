Cool choice.\n\nI feel like this season was a bit slow due to all the backstory stuff, but this was still a pretty awesome premise. Looking forward to see what season 5 brings.\n\nAlso damn, an entire season of the OP and ED teasing Akutagawa and he doesn't show up at all? Lame asf. He'll definitely show up for sure in season 5 though.",

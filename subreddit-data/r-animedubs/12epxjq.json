Old or new, as long as it's dubbed we'd like to hear about it. \n\nAnything good we should look out for? Anything bad we should try to avoid? Tell us a little bit of what you think. It's nice if you elaborate a bit on what it is you like or don't like about a show. That way your comment is useful to people who are looking for new anime to watch. :)\n\nWriting the names of the anime in **bold** is nice, to make it easier for people skimming the thread to pick out the names.\n\nSince this is also for people who are looking for new shows to watch, please use the spoilertag if you reveal any mayor plot points of the anime you are discussing (see spoilertag section in the sidebar for info on how).\n\n\nTo prevent low effort comments to steal the spotlight from people who put in a little bit more effort **top level comments in this thread must be at least 150 characters long** (roughly 3 sentences long).\n\n\n[You can find a list of the previous \"Your week in anime dubs\" posts here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/search/?q=author%3AAutoModerator+AND+title%3AYour+week+in+anime+dubs&amp;sort=new)",

Loving the atmosphere, and the music is dope, especially the opening. \n\nAlso gonna check out **Seraph of the End** and **Tokyo Revenges**, and a few other titles I'm forgetting and won't remember until I skim through Hulu again.",

            "comment": "I tried watching ***The Way of the Househusband***, but dropped it after 3 episodes. From what I've heard, the usual joke and criticism is about its slideshow visuals. But that's not something which bothers me. Unfortunately, the comedy just didn't click with me. And when comedy is pretty much all a show has going for it (which I felt to be the case here), that's a problem.\n\nAfter that, I rewatched ***D-Frag!***. It's been a number of years since I first saw it. A super wacky and over-the-top school comedy, albeit not quite as bonkers as the likes of *Nichijou* or *Paniponi Dash*. The major downside of D-Frag, in my eyes, are the two masochist characters. I'd be fine with one, but adding the second one was most definitely too much. Still a lot of fun overall, however.\n\nLast up was ***Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut***, which turned out to be an enjoyable watch. Seeing the astronaut training regimen was genuinely interesting (even if I can't know how accurate the depiction was and despite the fact the story is set in the middle of the last century). It took quite a while for Irina to finally soften up around Lev, but as per the tsundere principle: The longer it takes for the girl to come around, the sweeter the resolution (most of the time). Episode 7 (&gt;!Irina's space flight!&lt;) had me on the edge of my seat, and the finale was quite moving and gave the anime a great conclusion.",

            "comment": "Well I finished **To Your Eternity Season 2**. I truly believe it's one of the best anime of the new decade we're in. Every time I thought it was starting to get stale, it threw something totally bonkers. A remarkable show.\n\nI also finished rewatching **Wolf's Rain** with friends who hadn't seen it. Great first few episodes, great last few episodes, most of the middle is very take it or leave it for me. I would consider it essential anime viewing though.\n\nCurrently I'm watching **Trigun Stampede**. I probably won't be here next week so I'll just say my feelings now: it's really good, but I've never really been into Trigun? It's like one of my biggest anime hot takes, Trigun has never hooked me. So as someone who is ambivalent to the franchise, Stampede is perfectly watchable. I mean hey, the animation is amazing.\n\nWith friends I'm watching **Un-Go**. I have no idea how I feel about this show after 4 episodes, I don't think I'm into it? It's alright.\n\nI'm doing a thing with the same friends where we watch the first 2-3 episodes of some anime that we tried checking out a couple years ago but back then we weren't sure how we felt after one episode. The first of these shows that we watched was **Heat Guy J**. The best way to put this is that I had it logged that we would watch 3 episodes and after the 2nd, my friends begged me not to put on the third episode (I did anyway). It was just kind of a nothing show. Anyway next up is **Le Chevalier D'Eon** which I rewatched episode 1 of last night. This time I actually recognize David Matranga as the main character, I didn't last time.\n\nLast show I'll talk about is **Heaven's Lost Property**. Yeah this is the kind of ecchi comedy I don't like? It's either annoying or white noise. Doesn't even have full nudity. Apparently the manga is better but I can't see why in the anime. I have no idea why I blind bought this as a teenager, it was probably because it was $13 in a Funimation sale and I bought it with something else.",

Not a lot of shows (if any) have such a shift between seasons. From the near non-stop action/political plotting of the first season, to the slower, finding my fate/worth in life now my plot reason from S1 in S2 is just.... over.!&lt;  \n\n\nI've also re-watched a favourite of mine in preparation for the new season: **The Ancient Magus Bride.** Not necessarily the easiest to recommend if you suffer from depression, but the way this anime speaks to you on such an emotional level always leaves me crying when a certain booming voiced character is on screen. If you've seen it, you know the one.",

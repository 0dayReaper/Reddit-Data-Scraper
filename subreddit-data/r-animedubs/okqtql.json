The dub is all but confirmed, Funi just loves to make us wait\n\n**UPDATE:** Leah deleted the tweet and Instagram post, probably due to Funi not making the formal announcement yet. \n\nFirst news we\u2019ve gotten about Season 2, took a while but at least we know it\u2019s coming.\n\nExpect an announcement from Funimation soon.\n\nLink to her [Instagram Post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRWFkkXj0Ss/?utm_medium=copy_link).",

I still like Funimation and what they've done, with the exception of questionable past decisions by certain individuals or by the company. The reply above was meant to point out that it wasn't just this instance that people became upset at Funimation at the time. Instead of saying \"politicized dub translations\" I meant to say \"Political lines of dialogue.\" I know the instances  few and far in-between in terms of the number of anime Funimation dubs.",

I'll assume you're referring how little is said or what gets cut out in translation to which I would disagree. Subs don't have to account for the lip flaps in anime, meaning they could translate as much as they wanted to (Though this my vary due to factors like word choice or how fast the original voices goes through their words) while dubs would have to account for those things and adjust their scripts and directing accordingly to match.\n\n\n&gt;This is likely a trend started by the fans subbing groups that congregated around AnimeSuki, like Lunar Anime and Wannabe Fansubs. They tended to be significantly more conservative with their translations.\n\nAnime, as well as other media, more often than not have always been translated to covey the same messages or intent as the original, torrenting and other illegal streaming sites for anime did not create the trend to remain reserved (which now I think about it may have been what you meant by \"curtailed) in their political views. I don't know whether or not those sites imputed their political views in subs but these days, \"conservative\" translators also do not often imput those political views in subs.",

The sub of Miss Kobayashi does not do this and the dub does. Hence \"They only differ from the Sub not the original\".\n\nI agree with preserving meaning/intent, but how does the Sub \"not do this\"\n\n&gt;Which is where the problem came from because not many people speak Japanese that watch EN subs. Why would they? They already understand Japanese. Because of this people just assumed the sub was more faithful because of biases they have, even though it's not true.\n\nThere are English speaking watchers that know Japanese who could point out errors in translations, it's not just non Japanese speaking sub watchers making complaints. Where does the bias come from? Yes, Subs do make changes so nothing is lost in translation, but that's completely different from Dubs going out of their way to write some political commentary in their dialogue that was never present in the original.\n\n&gt;Also on the lip flaps thing, FUNimation has been known to alter the lip flaps if need be. \n\nYes, but Funimation still often cuts down on word count as compared to the original or subtitles. Funimation often translates differently while trying to keep original intentions, which is a good thing for localization.\n\n&gt;No they should not change the meaning by removing the politics because their audience doesn't like it. \n\nIf the original had politics, they can keep it for the translations. However if the original made no political statements, translators shouldn't go out of their way to make theirs. Audiences don't want it if it was never there in the first place. There are anime that do tackle political topics, But if they're not calling out specific one in real life, it's not up to translators to do it for them.\n\n&gt;That's just not true. Early fansub groups didn't know enough Japanese to even get it right or vice versa they did not know enough English to properly Translate. It is still very common in the manga translation scene. Hell commie sub is known and hated for changing things because they think its funny. They have completely rewritten shows so it doesn't even come close to the original, just for kicks. They are not a isolated case either. \n\nMy bad, I meant to say official and professional translations. I'm aware in the past translation from fansubs and,  non-professional translators in general, tended to get many things wrong. I'll try to keep my arguments relevant to the present state of anime localization. With that said, dubbing/subbing companies today translate for the sake of localization while being instructed to keep the original message. The problem rises when those companies decided to make unnecessary dialogue choices to fit their own political agendas, which either not everyone agrees with or want to hear.\n\n&gt;The people are not conservative in ideology. Their choices when they translated were conservative, again not in ideology. What I said means to err on the side of caution. When something politically or racy tended to pop up they would err on the side of caution and did not translate it properly in case they were wrong. They weren't good enough or cared to do it properly. They cared about not pissing off their fan base. Why put in a potentially controversial translation when you don't know if it's correct and we'll piss off your fans?\n\nReserved, maybe, conservative no. Conservative, with disregard to politics, would mean one who was oppose to changing something, which is obviously not the case with this discussion of translating. Translators don't really have to worry about backlash if translations were correct because  otherwise it would be a case of \"shooting the messenger\" which doesn't happen often. If official translators made changes that did not fit what the original had to say, they wouldn't be doing their job correctly.",

    "postText": "Kansai and Osaka dialects are translated in various ways. The most common English dub ways are a Brooklyn accent, a Bronx accent, a Southern accent, or a British accent (this seemed more common in the 90s).\n\nI'm not familiar with non-English dubs. I have heard that the Azumanga Daioh manga and anime translated Osaka in various ways: the Russian version made her Ukranian while the Korean translation made her from the city of Busan.\n\nMy favourite way is Southern US accent. Think Osaka from Azumanga Daioh (who has a Beaumont, Texas accent in particular), Nanako from Lucky Star, and Shizuru from My-Hime/My-Otome. \n\nAnime fans make fun of this localization, but I *like* the way they sound. My-Hime fans loved to make fun of Shizuru's \"bad accent\" but I think the Southern Belle trope fit her character well. Plus there's nothing *wrong* with having a Southern accent. People IRL don't choose their natural accents.",

(Plus from speaking/understanding a fair amount of japanese myself and having some friends in japan that speak with it. Which just makes things confusing for me haha.)  --- I think the Southern Accent is the one.  That's the answer.  I think it makes the most sense.  Brooklyn or Bronx accent doesn't make sense to me.  Southern makes perfect sense even in a regional sense.    \n\n\nAs for anime fans disliking the localization.  I think it's perfect.  It's a quick easy way to know where a character is from and if they are not local to a certain area.  You don't have to think about it.  When you hear a character with say a southern accent in japan.  You immediately go \"oh, they must be from the Kansai region.\" --- And that's the point.  You get that they have an accent.

At first it was jarring as I don't think I've ever heard a character dubbed with that thick of a Brooklyn/Jersey accent, but knowing what I do about the Kansai accent it seems appropriate.\n\nSomething fun for me being from Chicago would be to hear someone do the Chicago accent (think Joan Cusack as a famous example) for characters with the Kansai accent. Chicago and Osaka are considered sister cities and have a lot of similarities with each other so it would make sense to me for Kansai characters having that rough Midwestern charm and good humor.",

    "postText": "So Media Blasters and Ascendant Animation are both American companies that license and produce dubs of hentai. Unsurprisingly, the voice actors in Media Blasters\u2019 shows use pseudonyms. \nHowever, the voice actors for Ascendant Animation\u2019s shows use their actual names. In fact, they actively promote their involvement on social media. \n\nAny thought or theories on why voice actors are open in regards to their involvement with hentai dubbed by Ascendant Animation but not Media Blasters?",

We watched a few episodes of Kotaro Lives Alone and she enjoyed it, and I wanna focus on shows with no fan service. Her favorite genres of regular TV are comedy and thriller. Think I\u2019m gonna start with Erased unless I can think of something better",

She might be into it.  Or, if you feel like being emotionally destroyed, but together, you could try watching Your Lie in April.  Not exactly a comedy, or thriller, but... I like to recommend it.  Beyond that... Alice and Zoroku?  That might tick the right boxes too.",

            "comment": "My first anime recommendation is usually Sword Art Online. Good action, good characters, great first half of the first season, elements of a lot of different genres. After you finish the first season (or however far you want to go with the series) you can take what you liked about the show (comedy, action, romance, sci-fi, fantasy, etc.) and find other anime based on that. For me, I started watching because of the action and was surprised to find myself drawn into the romance aspect of the show and now I love romcoms.\n\nAside from Sword Art Online, here are some other shows with little-to-no fan service:\n\nKaguya-sama: Love is War\n\nLove After World Domination\n\nAharen-san wa Hakarenai\n\nSpy x Family\n\nTonari no Seki-kun: the Master of Killing Time\n\nBofuri: I Don\u2019t Want to Get Hurt, so I\u2019ll Max Out My Defense\n\nSleepy Princess in the Demon Castle\n\nKuma Kuma Kuma Bear\n\nRestaurant to Another World",

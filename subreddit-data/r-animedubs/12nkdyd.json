            "comment": "Seika: No witnesses.\n\nalso Seika: lok jk just a prank dudes\n\nGood enough ending. Wrapped up the immediate plot points but kept the story open so you would ~~read the source books~~ watch a second season. The hero and demon lord being relics of the past but nonetheless dangerous to world peace is an interesting twist. It gives a reason for Amyu and Seika to travel together.\n\nSuffered from Advertisethelightnovelitus, but it wasn't as egregious are other shows. It had a lot of interesting elements. Biggest one was Seika wasn't your normal wide eyed idealist. He was pretty jaded and pragmatic, but not so ruthless as to be jarring. His magic was also a nice departure from most isekais, in that he was absolute dogshit at the world's normal magic, but his superior folded one thousand times Nippon magic was not only extremely powerful, but so different people didn't know what to make of it.\n\nOne weakness was that 12 episodes wasn't enough to give good characterization to all the characters, like the princess and Mabel.\n\nI'd a watch a season 2, but they ended this one well enough that it's fine if they left it at that.\n\nYuki is best fake Jahy.",

Some outrageous decision-making by Seika, but he was clearly emotionally compromised because of the past-life history and stuff, so I'll give it a pass. \n\nThe best scene in the whole show was the final scene where they find Yifa and Mabel causing a ruckus in the city.",

Im surprised Amyu and the princess just accepted that he can do that.\n\nThis show wasn't amazing, but it was still a fun watch. I'd gladly watch a 2nd season if it gets one.",

I didn't like the way Seika \"spoke for\" Anyu during the jail scene. And we don't know what that shadow was with miss precog princess. But she seemed to be ok with them escaping? I don't know. Everything Seika did in the past couple episodes felt out of character. But it sounds like him being the demon king really has no bearing on anything he does.",

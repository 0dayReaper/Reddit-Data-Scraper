Maybe it's his face and the reaction to it.\n\nOverall, nice seeing the Boruto dub catching up. I wish they would go on a streaming network and release episodes weekly. I'd prefer that.\n\nI wonder how much they've dubbed? I've heard before(I could be wrong) that the episodes are recorded, but haven't been released yet. I wonder how much has been dubbed?",

Toonami is one of those things that started out good then became a massive disappointment.  It\u2019s because of toonami that actually served to mess up Crunchyroll, Crunchyroll was planning on integrating closed captioning in their shows as soon as they had things set to separate closed captioning from subtitles for their dub content, but since toonami decided to all of a sudden put several shows on its platform and then take it right off again, due to federal law, any show that aired on broadcast tv must have closed captioning on every platform that offers said show, or be forced to pay a ton of money per episode, they were forced to suddenly slam the shows with closed captioning before they were ready.  Yeah I\u2019m not a fan of toonami and would be overjoyed when it crashes and burns, but it\u2019s true their decisions have caused more harm then good.",

I watch the sub watch the dub from time to time for Boruto.\n\nI heard Toonami screws dubs from time to time(I think Attack on Titan, first has to air on Toonami, and then it gets put or CR/Funimation, but I could be wrong).\n\nI didn't know anything about Closed Captioning and laws about it. I learned something new.  Thanks for that!\n\nI'm stupid and slow so I hope I understand what you're saying.\n\nSo what you're saying about CC is, Crunchy was going to have add CC for their dubs and subs but since they aired on Toonami, they only have two options. Either pay a ton of money per episode or put CCs on their shows. \n\nCan you elaborate on the \"before ready part\"? Were the CCs bad or something related to the episode?\n\nI'm currently watching Suits(a law show) right now and I'm interested in this law thing now. Sorry if this is long or bothersome. I just find it interesting.",

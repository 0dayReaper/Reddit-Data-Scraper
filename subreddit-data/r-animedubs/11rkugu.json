            "comment": "When the digital purchase thread dropped, I just kept track of the new cast members - so now I can actually talk about said casting choices in this batch of episodes! Not going to get too much into the content itself since 1) The dub eps only just came out for most people and 2) There were so many new additions to the cast, not to mention reprisals (many of whom are major players in the arc), and I'd rather focus on that and not clutter up my comment more than it already is.\n\nI *love* what they're doing with **Orochi** &amp; **Komurasaki**. The former is capturing the same \"all over the place\" energy for me without the actor just sounding like he's trying to do a carbon-copy of his JPN counterpart (different overall voice print, tone, inflections, etc...), which is what I love to see with dubs - capturing the essence of a character (or just even their vibe for smaller roles) but with the actor/director team putting their own spin on it. Gives me a ton of faith for future episodes given how prevalent the character is. As far as the latter, I'm just happy they cast a deeper-voiced actress because I remember being pretty struck with how deep her JPN counterpart's voice got during more serious moments after episodes of her using a gentler but just as refined \"public/client voice.\" Molly Searcy in the dub matched that important juxtaposition imo. Obviously need more with **King** and **Queen**, but I'm definitely down with what I've heard so far at least and I'm especially looking forward to seeing Queen get to let loose - Major Attaway's stage roles in shows like Aladdin or more recently Little Shop of Horrors (Audrey II) lead me to believe it'll be pitch-perfect. I also think I prefer Gabe Kunda's deeper vocal print for King off the bat. Just sounds badass and feels right for his character's age (late 40s), build, etc... Doug Jackson as **Hyogoro** also is a great choice that fits so well - not too much to say at this point.\n\n**Toko**, **Tomoyasu**, and **Page One** mostly all worked but might take a little time to grow on me in areas. Toko's laugh sounds super endearing, but I'd be lying if I said her almost yell-speaking occasionally didn't get a bit too grating at times. And for Tomoyasu, I don't really know what it is? Kenny Green sometimes sounds like it's slipping into an odd accent I can't place, but other times not and he just sounds like a joyful somewhat silly old man. For the most part it's fine so it might have just been some odd reads here and there? I have zero complaints about Page One's dinosaur voice, I just wonder if he'll sound too gruff in his fully human form.\n\nWe also got a bunch of reprisals who've at least been out of the show for an arc or two (wouldn't be One Piece without 'em). Eustass Kid, X Drake, GECKO MORIA (god Chris Guerrero nails that laugh)... Everyone sounds like they never left, although I will admit I've always been *a little* hit or miss on Justin Cook's take on post-timeskip Kid (just think the voice he's putting on can sound a bit forced when he's not actively yelling). The only one I figured was a recast right away was Caribou... but it's Caribou so I think I'll live haha. (*ETA: So uh fun fact, Caribou is being played by the [same VA](https://twitter.com/Bowling4anime/status/1636059829008465921) apparently. Shows what I know haha*)\n\nDon't have too much to say on the script, but I do remember a great 4th wall break when O-Toko is explaining the joke about her name - thought it was a fun way to call attention to it. Plus it helps that you can easily buy the strawhats needing a very basic wordplay joke explained to them by a small child when they're foreigners in Wano haha. Also very random, but I recall some good detailed lip flap matches like the end of Ep 921 (matching \"poor\" with the correct vowel mouth shape). Also here's where I put my monthly thanks that the dub gets to keep \"Beast Pirates\" over the sub's \"Animal Kingdom Pirates.\"\n\nKeep up the great work One Piece dub team and until the next batch drop! God-willing it gets put on CR eventually and is allowed to actually be officially promoted beyond an announcement tweet for the Microsoft Store. I will say that I'm looking forward to Kiku's babysitting adventures with all the children &gt;!+ Big Mom!&lt; more than Luffy being stuck in prison again for at least another 20 episodes haha.",

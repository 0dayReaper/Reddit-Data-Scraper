    "postText": "This is driving me kind of crazy so I'm posting it here\n\nSources -- Wikipedia, IMDB, TV Tropes -- claim that Crispin Freeman voiced Gus Grav in the English dub of *Bakugan*. I was surprised by that both since the dub was done in Canada and Freeman is by far the biggest name in the cast list.\n\nSo, I went back and watched samples of the series. The voice for Gus sounds *nothing* like Freeman. I'm sure you know that Freeman has a very distinctive voice -- whether he's Alucard, Itachi, Electro, Red Arrow, or Kray Foresight, you know it's him. For some reason, the voice actor for Gus is never listed in the end credits so there's no primary source to verify this either.\n\nHere's a *Bakugan* episode streaming on Tubi as a sample: [https://tubitv.com/tv-shows/600901/s05-e05-taste-of-defeat?start=true](https://tubitv.com/tv-shows/600901/s05-e05-taste-of-defeat?start=true)\n\nIs this a rumor that's flown under the radar until now? Was it not *the* Crispin Freeman who voiced Gus? Any info would be appreciated\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks everyone -- I'm now convinced this was an urban legend/misreporting and have edited the credits on Wikipedia and TV Tropes (to Chris McCawley, per ANN) to reflect this and hopefully prevent further misinformation.",

It's probably nonsense. Both Bakugan shows were dubbed in Toronto using local actors. Freeman, to the best of my knowledge, has only ever visited Toronto for conventions and primarily lives in Los Angeles.\n\nI noticed some of these same sites list Brad Swaile as King in Beyblade Metal Fury. It doesn't [sounds much like him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkWvO0PQeWI). Like Bakugan, it was also recorded in Toronto. Brad lives in Vancouver. It's probably made-up nonsense, too.\n\nIt would've been nice if Nelvana had made proper credits for these shows, but despite them being union productions they only credit the major characters.",

Maybe if the show released when he was starting out, but he started in the late 90s and, according to IMDb, he was supposedly in just S2 which released in 2009. Based on a clip I found Gus Grav\u2019s voice isn\u2019t as deep nor as distinctive as Crispin usually is. ANN lists his S2 va as Chris McCawley, whose only credits are for Gus Grav and some bit parts. Seems like someone emailed the licensor to get the name of the va, but they didn\u2019t include a screenshot so it\u2019s kinda just on their word.",

In hindsight, it's pretty odd that Crispin, an American, would be credited in a show like this when the rest of the dub cast is clearly Canadian if I remember right (it's not done by Ocean Group tho). It's like someone desperately tried to look for a proper credit but gave up and just picked someone who looked like they could fit the role.",

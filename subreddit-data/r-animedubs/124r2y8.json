That type of fantastical setting, some romance but with actual payoff.\nThe romance can be more of a subplot like Escaflowne as long as there is some playoff. Doesn\u2019t have to be isekai necessarily.",

Very fantastical, and the first season has a couple of romance-based subplots although they're not especially overt throughout a lot of the story. I'm not as certain about romance content in the second season because I'm less familiar with it.\n\nIt concludes properly - twice, in fact, as season 1 stands well on its own.",

It looks like we do have similar taste (I was all about FY during my teenage years and Escaflowne is my all time-fave) and I really enjoyed 86. \n\nThe setting is more of sci-fi/dystopian than a fantastical one though but it does have a (subtle) romance subplot and ends really nicely imo. Also mecha.",

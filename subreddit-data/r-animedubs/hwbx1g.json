The show acknowledges the language barriers between the characters (first ep has our Japanese and French leads conversing in actual English for instance)",

It's weirdly difficult to accidentally output a mix that's part original dialogue &amp; part dubbed. The original dialogue all comes in as one long stereo or 5.1 file, same length as the music &amp; SFX. You'd have to very deliberately separate out just some portions of the original dia and mute/unmute the clips, while reversing that decision on the dubbed dialogue, or make some equally deliberate automation errors (basically throwing the faders all the way up and down on just parts of the original mix). Stranger things have happened, but it would definitely require A. A drunk mixer B. A stoned producer C. A mentally absent video editor and D. A sleeping QC operator lol",

I feel releasing even just subbed version to  north america and other markets would be wise because I feel all this does is push people to pirate the show to be able to be involved in the conversation and community as the show comes out. By time it hits north america it loses a lot of the steam..",

As it stands, this is one of the faster turnaround times for a Netflix anime in relation to its Japanese broadcast.",

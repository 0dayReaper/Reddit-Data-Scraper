My heart dropped like a stone when that moment happened. \n\nThough, I did love the detective work, makeshift forensics, and CSI Stone world bit of the ep. Though, I would've marked the fuck out if Senkuu and comp put on sunglasses and deliver a cheesy pun. \n\n I'm 80% sure that Amaryllis is voiced by Leah Clark.",

She did pretend to \"fall in love\" with anyone she deemed the master.\n\nNot sure I'm gonna like this arc. This show is at its best when it forgoes the idea of \"villains\". Tsukasa was the weakest part of the show when he was around.",

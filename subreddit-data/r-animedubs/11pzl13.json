I initially thought Sentai was going to snag this title since they tend to get the Fantasy/Romance Anime series.\n\nHere\u2019s to hope that this series doesn\u2019t get a 2 week simulcast delay and hopefully that either Iyuno, Los Angeles, VSI Los Angeles or Studiopolis will dub this series.",

Thomas, Mela Lee, Tony Oliver, Michelle Ruff, David Vincent, Karen Strassman, Imari Williams, Zach Aguilar, D.W. McCann, Frank Todaro, Crispin Freeman (Union-Only), Ben Lepley, Morgan Berry, and especially Jake Eberle have not done **ANY** anime dubs at other studios (e.g. Studiopolis, Iyuno, NYAV Post, VSI Los Angeles), regardless if most voice actors are \"freelancers\".\n- They started hiring a lot of new voice actors from the **\"Adventures in Voice Acting\"** workshops every year. Now, I have no issue with these new upcoming actors, however, because of the rise of these upcoming voice actors it leads to heavy competition during auditions resulting in the other talent pool of actors to get less work (e.g. Christine Marie Cabanos), be \"swept under the rug\" and either end up stop working at Bang Zoom!, or end up retiring and switching careers (e.g. Shelby Lindley, J.D. Zelman, Caitlin Chang etc.) because they couldn't keep up with the other voice actors, and same can be said with those new and upcoming voice actors as well.\n- Bang Zoom!'s castings done by Mami Okada who has been Bang Zoom!'s primary casting director since 2013/2014 resulted in having their actors be cast out of \"favoritism\" or \"cherry-picking\" resulting in many and some of these voice actors to be \"swept under the rug\" which ties to the previous point.\n\n\n&gt; They may sprinkle in some newer actors here and there, but they both still have a terrible habit of resorting to double-casting, and sometimes even triple-casting for the most important characters, whereas Bang Zoom at least tries to avoid that in recent years as far as I can tell.\n\nRegardless of what Bang Zoom! is doing most of their union dubs since 2015 onwards compared to the ones from the early 2000's to 2013 became very unrecognizable and hard to distinguish which of their dubs are Unionized and which ones are Non-Union considering that 85-90% of their current Talent pool have worked in both Union and Non-Union dubs respectively at Bang Zoom! and the majority of the Union-Only actors just consists of Crispin Freeman, Jessica DiCicco, Kari Wahlgren, Abby Trott, Erica Lindbeck, and/or Steve Blum, and those that hardly do voicework at the studio these days(e.g. Robbie Daymond, Cristina Vee, Max Mittelman, Erica Lindbeck, Michelle Ruff) as they primarily utilize 2-3 Union-only voice actors fir their Unionized productions when compared to the Unionized dubs done at Studiopolis, NYAV Post, Iyuno, and VSI Los Angeles that go all out with their voice cast.\n\nSo because of this, I only would rather watch the ones done at Studiopolis, NYAV Post, Iyuno, Salami (who only did Cyberpunk so far) and VSI Los Angeles because they utilize a wide variety of actors in their dubs compared to the ones done at Bang Zoom! as they just continue only using 2-3 Union-Only voice actors and call it a day for their current Union dub productions. Also, I'm grateful that Netflix, who is Bang Zoom!'s 2nd biggest client after Aniplex, didn't outsource *Ultraman, Baki, Aggretsuko, Shaman King (2021), Beastars, Super Crooks, Blue Period, Komi Can't Communicate, Spriggan, Romantic Killer, Bastard!, Vinland Saga, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, Child of Kamiari Month, Kotaro Lives Alone, Great Pretender, Vampire in the Garden,* and *Drifting Home* to Bang Zoom! as those particular series and films seem more suited to be dubbed at other LA-based studios and shows that you don't need to send a certain project to be dubbed at Bang Zoom! all the time.",

And you really shouldn't fault Bang Zoom for using only 2-3 union-only VAs when you can easily chalk it up to those kind of VAs either not having enough time to work on anime, or they've just lost interest in it altogether. The other studios don't often get to use several union-only VAs either.",

Thomas, John Snyder, Karen Strassman, Jon Allen, Morgan Berry, Ben Lepley, Chris Jai Alex, Marc Diraison, Rachael Lillis, Ezra Weisz, Tony Oliver, Chris Cason, Joe Zieja, Faye Mata, etc.) haven't made any appearances in the more recent anime dubs done at those studios especially the anime dubs done at Studiopolis either it has to do with:\n\n- Those voice actors/voice actresses don't want work at that recording studio (e.g. Studiopolis, Iyuno-SDI Group, VSI) or don't know those particular recording studios and just prefer working with the studios and the directors they're more familiar with.\n- The actor's voiceover agents don't have close connections to those particular studios.\n- The production team at those particular studios such as Studiopolis, VSI Los Angeles and/or Iyuno-SDI Group don't know these particular voice actors and want to utilize the voice actors they're more familiar with.\n\nOn top of that, there is the Show's content, Union status and an actor\u2019s current work load can all also effect where and what they work, even the Acting style or preferences, or a casting directors vision at the recording studio, can effect who they hire. In fact it\u2019s worth mentioning that Lauren Landa hasn\u2019t done ANY new anime dubs done at Studiopolis outside of the Viz Media dub of *Sailor Moon* and *Sailor Moon Crystal* considering the vast majority of her VO work is at Bang Zoom, SDI Media/Iyuno-SDI Group and on rare occurrences VSI Los Angeles, especially the former studio. Even Michelle Ruff outside of her contributions through Sailor Moon and reprising her role as Rukia for the Bleach: Thousand Year-Blood War hasn\u2019t done any other anime for Studiopolis.\n\n&gt;**It really shouldn't be hard for you at all to tell which Bang Zoom dubs are union and which ones aren't. Anything from pre- or even post-merger Crunchyroll is non-union, whereas the ones commissioned by Netflix and Aniplex of America are definitely union. Simple as that.**\n\nFor your information I could tell which ones are Union and non-Union from the voice actors they utilize from Abby Trott, Crispin Freeman, Steve Blum, etc. Secondly Aniplex didn\u2019t started officially having their future series and later seasons of pre-existing shows Union by 2019 as for Netflix with the exception of Ingress the vast majority of their anime dubs done at Bang Zoom! from 2015-2019 were largely non-Union and Netflix didn\u2019t officially started doing Union dubs at Bang Zoom! by 2020.\n\n&gt;**The other studios don't often get to use several union-only VAs either.**\n\nYes they do look at the ones from Studiopolis, and especially the Netflix anime dubs done at NYAV Post (until 2022), Iyuno Los Angeles and VSI Los Angeles, including the latter studio they utilized several actors that are Union-Only/SAG-AFTRA actors that were from the Live-Action dubs or through on-camera work in their anime productions mixed with the rest of the voice actors that currently worked at Studiopolis and especially Bang Zoom! (e.g. Ryan Colt Levy, Courtney Lin).",

            "comment": "Normally I wait until the dubs have wrapped up to watch most (non-sequel) seasonal shows. But I decided to pull the trigger and get started on a couple this week. Looking at the ratings and tags on MAL, I didn't feel like my experience would be much better waiting to binge them later.\n\nFirst I started with **Kamikatsu**. Really enjoyed all of the parody aspects earlier on, but it's actually become a straight up fun Isekai with parody aspects and plenty of slapstick comedy.\n\nNext I picked up **The Legendary Hero is Already Dead** which has definitely been good for a laugh. It also has the occasional sweet moment as well (I like some mean-spirited humor too, but I've honestly gotten a little worn out by so many shows trying to do Konosuba or IASIP humor/characters), which keeps things interesting I guess.\n\nI'm kind of surprised both of these show have ratings in the 6s on MAL. I think they're both really fun and funny. I suppose the dub quality helps elevate the humor some.\n\nI've also been watching **Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear**, **In Another World with My Smartphone**, and **Konosuba: An Explosion on This Wonderful World!** weekly.\n\nBeing at roughly the halfway point, **KKK Bear** (wrote that abbreviation before thinking about it. I'ma leave it) has been a solid continuation from S1.\n\n**Smartphone** has felt a bit more rushed and lazy than S1 (which I actually enjoyed a decent amount). The recasts have done really well though, so that's been a nice surprise.\n\n**Explonosuba** has also been a lot of fun. I love the comedy of Konosuba, but I do like how this spin-off has some of the more mean-spirited humor toned down a bit (and makes the characters more likeable). Also the Crimson Demon chunibyo stuff is just too damn funny (loved all of that stuff in the movie too).",

Only three episodes left at this point, so I'll probably finish season 1 tomorrow. \n\nI'm surprised how easy this show is to binge. There's always something exciting going on, and the little elements of mystery keep me hooked. I did find it a bit odd that &gt;!Taiju and Yuzuriha haven't been shown again since leaving to spy on Tsukasa!&lt; in terms of pacing, but Senku is definitely interesting enough as the main character to carry the show, and many of the new characters from &gt;!Ishigami village!&lt; are likeable and quirky too. The humor can still be hit or miss at times, but it hits way more often than it misses. \n\nI'm having a lot of fun with this show, so I'm likely to catch up before the end of season 3!",

            "comment": "I finished the last 3 episodes of ***Aggressive Retsuko 5*** on the weekend. As for overall impressions, it was another cool installment in the series. I love how each season steers the show in a fresh new direction. Well, except that &gt;!Retsuko being 'recruited' in the Party of Rage felt a bit similar to her recruitment to OTM Girls in season 3!&lt;, but it was still a neat plot point. Regarding the ending, I felt a little bummed that &gt;!there wasn't more of an epilog. Especially seeing Retsuko and Haida filling out their marriage registration in a brief montage was quite underwhelming!&lt;. Nonetheless, I had a whale of a time watching it.\n\nAfterwards, I rewatched ***Didn't I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!***. I enjoyed this one a lot when I first saw it. It has just the right amount of cuteness and comedy that resonated with me. Plus this anime actually features a Hyouka spoof (\"I just *have* to know!\"), which I give it massive props for.\n\nI'm now 8 episodes into ***Tomo-chan Is a Girl***. And to be honest, I'm not really feeling it \u2013 at least not to the extent I thought I would. I've heard several people call this show rom-com-of-the-season material (or even more than that), but I'm not seeing that at all. It's decent and I haven't been bored watching it, but nothing about it strikes me as amazing. It's somewhat ironic that Carol is my favorite character so far, because I think she looks rather ugly and I'm not a fan of her voice (I believe her VA plays the role both in English and Japanese). But she's just *too fricking funny*.",

I'd probably give it an 8/10.",

                            "comment": "u/Darwin343 u/BlueSpark4\n\nYou both mentioned the Tomo-chan Dub. I finished it and it was definitively the funnier than the Sub, but if you're on the fence u/BlueSpark4, I say just finish it or just watch the last episode (had the best lines and I would advice crunchyroll to give those writers a raise).However, if you're looking for something in the same ballpark: a funny dub with sharp script and a great cast, I'm just going to list a 6 favourites below:\n\n1. **Horimiya (Dub):** Entire cast is great, but Alejandro Saab as Miyamura brings a warmth and humour to the role in drama and funny moments. As for Hori-sanm her actrees is similar to Dress-Up Darling's Gojo, a Voice Actor making their anime debut. She sounds more grown-up then a lot of other voice actors and considering the maturity of her character it fits. Side-characters stand out thanks to Zeno Robinson and Anairis Quinones, and both of their careers have gone upwards after this (they play My Hero Academia's Hawks and Mirko respectively). Hope the cast comes back for \"The Missing Pieces\" anime. If they're covering the skits I think they are from the manga, then this will be genius comedy.\n2. **Sleepy Princess (Dub):** Kira Buckland is hilarious as the Princess and considering she's played Stone Ocean's Joleyne and Nier Automata's 2B, you realize just how wide her range is. Twilight (Demon King) is voiced by Alejandro Saab (Horimiya's Miyamura) and easily has the funniest lines in the show.\n3. **Kaguya-sama (Dub):** The two leads played by Aaron Dismuke and Alexis Tipton are sometimes funnier than the original. The big change in the narration, and Ian Sinclair goes for a 150% extra delivery and hams up the proceedings in a good way (using his style from Space Dandy). He even interjects throughout the show more often and changes his delivery on the fly. End of Episode 1 gives a good example of that. Plus Amanda Lee (AmaLee) voices Hayasaka and her delivery has more emotional range than the sub, but it's only slightly.**4) Bofuri: Max Defense (Dub):** Great all around cast held together by Megan Shipman and Jade Saxton. Love it. Plus the Developers reacting in real-time to the insanity of their own game is a highlight. Plus the post-episode script describing crazy in-game rumours about the main characters. Great supporting cast as well and its funny how most of them are spread across this list as some of my favourite actors.\n4. **Love After World Domination (Dub):** Fantastic dub with great performances by Lindsay Seidel and Anthony DiMascio. No complaints.\n5. **Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun (Dub):** Leagues better than the Sub. Much better script and the leading performances by Juliet Simmons and Ty Mahany.\n6. **Nichijou (Dub):** Even if the original is a classic, I still enjoyed the Dub, because I was never irritated by a single actor (something I can't say about the Sub). Plus some skits are way funnier with a sharper script but its case by case. Last two episodes are brilliant and the leading performances by Morgan Laur\u00e9 Garrett and Leah Clark are perfect and their banter is Grade-A comedy.",

But this isn't even a big factor in the first place because I have pretty low standards when it comes to voice acting.\n\nThanks for putting together the recommendations list. I have, in fact, seen all 7 shows you mentioned :). *Kaguya-sama* is my second-favorite rom-com of all time, *Sleepy Princess* surprisingly knocked it out of the park with its comedy, and *Horimiya* is a super enjoyable romance show (looking forward to rewatching it when the *Missing Pieces* releases).",

So we won't be getting the rest of Part II dubbed? Also, how is the Part I dub if you've seen it?

There's a lot of action, but the main plot doesn't kick in until after the quarter mark when a big character event occurs.\n\nAgree with Nekopara: that 1st episode is really boring. The slice of life in the first 5 mins is fine, but then they introduce this random baby catgirl, and it becomes like Devil is a Part-Timer season 2. \n\nBocchi the Rock (subbed) didn't start getting good for me until episode 4, when the entire crew is assembled.

                                    "comment": "Ahh, well the reason I ask is because Fate/Zero is a prequel to the 3 routes of Fate/stay night (the original Fate/stay night series by Studio Deen, the Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works series by ufotable, and the Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel movie trilogy by ufotable). It actually came out between the release of the original series by DEEN and the UBW series by ufotable. So, while it can definitely be watched first, if you're just not feeling it, you could always watch one of the other series first. I personally started with the original by DEEN, but I know a lot of folks recommend skipping that one. It's a bit dated production-wise, isn't a great adaptation of that route (from what I understand), and it does offer a few spoilers for (and/or steals a bit of content from) the other routes.\n\nI mention this because I tried Zero first, and ended up dropping it a bit before the midway mark, mostly because it felt like I was missing too many references and felt like the show kept nodding and winking at the viewer (me) and I wasn't understanding because I hadn't seen the content it was referencing. Went back and started the original, and then came back and (re)watched Zero and liked it a lot more. Personally, I feel like if Apocrypha left a bit of a bad taste in your mouth, and Zero isn't doing it for you, you could probably just try and \"start\" with UBW. It's my personal favorite, and a good leaping off point imo. That might ignite your interest a bit in Zero, and offer a bit of a palate cleanser from Apocrypha.\n\nI don't personally recommend watching HF before Zero. It's a bit faster paced than the other routes (being 3 movies instead of 24-27 episodes), and I suspect would have felt even moreso if I hadn't seen Zero. I felt like it just kinda handwaved a lot of explanations surrounding the plot, assuming the viewer had seen both UBW and Zero (at least).",

Very informative post, friend. I watched Zero after Apocrypha because I saw the Trash Taste Podcast recommending it   to newbies that are starting the franchise. I also was wary to start the Stay Night storylines due to people online complaining about Shirou as a MC.",

If you like being at the edge of your seat a lot this is the one for you. At first it might seem all over the place and hard to keep track of but trust me it all comes together, you get to know the characters well, and wow the development is so awesome. Please give it a try, you won\u2019t regret it!\n\n**The Irregular at magic high school** just started this one. The brother complex the sister has is throwing me off though. Hoping I\u2019ll just get used to it and like the anime",

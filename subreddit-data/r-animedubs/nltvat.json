Sabat's most popular role as Zoro and not Vegeta is also astonishing to me.\n\nAre these different ranks? Like the character popularity is a separate vote and not the voice actor's most iconic role? That would make more sense as I can see the One Piece characters being much more popular right now since the anime is active and Bleach, DB are not.",

Unsurprisingly many many Japanese voice actors at the top, but the mind blowing thing of looking at this list ([https://myanimelist.net/people.php](https://myanimelist.net/people.php)) is who were #98 and #62 which makes me take this list with a HUGE grain of salt.\n\n\\#98 - Kanye West - He's credited with ONE theme song on some obscure anime movie in 2008 yet is this popular... wtf people???\n\n\\#62 - Adolf Hitler - WTF? WTF WTF SMH WTF... I guess he's credited as a writer for something that was adapted to a Manga but... WTF? I mean seriously why does he really have an entry at all.  And think about this, only Johnny Yong Bosch was favorited by more users... WTF???",

I'm guessing it's because he's played a couple of huge roles (Eren, Kirito, etc.), which give him a lot of exposure.\n\nWhile Matt is certainly bolstered by playing a popular character from one of the most popular series of the past 10 years, I have seen tons of love for his other roles: Jotaro from Jojo Part 3, Leorio in Hunter x Hunter, Kiritsugu in Fate/Zero, and so on. Pretty much any Youtube video that has a character voiced by Matt is guaranteed to have at least a handful of comments gushing about him. (I distinctly remember how happy people were when he was announced as playing Jotaro.) That said, I think what actually catapulted him into the spotlight is his reportoire of notable video game roles: McCree, Leon Kennedy, Chrom, Yusuke Kitagawa... His presence in the game industry is pretty ubiquitous.",

Lelouch happens to be the most popular at #1, although Ichigo is also in the top 50 but ranked #46 (oddly enough, Izaya from Durarara, who is also voiced by JYB, is just below him).",

            "comment": "I agree that Steve Blum and Johnny Yong Bosch are pretty iconic when it comes to anime dubbing. Matthew Mercer, from what I've heard of him, is pretty great too.\n\nChristopher Sabat I think is a bit overrated, his early career roles range from bad to average if you look at it objectively and don't simply have nostalgia bias for him. He also got very lucky being one of Funimation's first actors and directors so he was bound to be shoved down your throat considering how much anime they dub in Texas now.\n\nTodd Haberkorn I personally haven't found to be very remarkable at all, like Sabat I think he's just overexposed due to where he happens to be based. The rest of those actors I don't have a strong opinion on.\n\nI think Dan Green is a pretty iconic voice actor in the anime category and I'd put him above guys like Sabat simply for his range and talent. I'd also add Brad Swaile to that list for the Canadian actors (Death Note). Sadly these guys don't do much these days as the work is outsourced to wherever is cheapest, so it's not really a meritocracy in the way we'd like to believe.",

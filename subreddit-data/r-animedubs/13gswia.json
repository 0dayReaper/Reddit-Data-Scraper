That kind of typical anime setting is something I sadly can't handle anymore. :(",

To be vague, it starts with a girl saving another one out of an arranged marriage via a duel with her Gundam. A big focus is mainly about the social/political divide on those from space and those from Earth.\n\nIf you know Revolutionary Girl Utena, it\u2019s like that with a Gundam theme, at least on the surface. It of course goes deeper in its world.",

Witch from Mercury is set in a school, but it\u2019s not your typical school setting stuff, no classes stuff or school projects or anything like that. It\u2019s basically just a Gundam dueling school, with a set of unique rules. So far it has been great story development and I\u2019m enjoying the series. Definitely getting more and more interesting.",

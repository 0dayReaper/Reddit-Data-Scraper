    "postText": "**Synopsis from MyAnimeList:**\n\n&gt;The bustling metropolis of Kansai, where cybernetic screens litter the neon landscape, may seem like a technological utopia at first glance. But in the dark alleys around the brightly-lit buildings, an unforgiving criminal underbelly still exists in the form of fugitives known as \"Akudama.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No stranger to these individuals, Kansai police begin the countdown to the public execution of an infamous Akudama \"Cutthroat,\" guilty of killing 999 people. However, a mysterious message is sent to several elite Akudama, enlisting them to free Cutthroat for a substantial amount of money. An invisible hand seeks to gather these dangerous personas in one place, ensuring that the execution is well underway to becoming a full-blown bloodbath. \n\n[Previous Anime Dub Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/search/?q=author%3AAutoModerator%20AND%20title%3AAnime%20Dub%20Discussion%20-&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sr_nsfw=)",

            "comment": "Akudama Drive is one of my top-10 all time favorites, and one of the best dubbed animes of the past few years, credit to the entire cast and crew at Kocha Sound. I really do believe that it's a dub masterpiece. The show is gripping, action packed, suspenseful and full of mystery. But the dub performances in this show is some of the best work I've heard from the VAs. \n\nAnd it's an all-star cast as well. you get TX regulars like **Macy Anne Johnson**, **Matt Shipman**, and **Brittany Lauda**. LA Regulars like **Jonah Scott** and **Zeno Robinson**. Some surprise New York VAs that shine just as amazingly like **Y. Chang** and **Daisy Guevara**. And some long, LONG time veterans like **Veronica Taylor**. Kocha did not have to go this hard with the casting. But they took full advantage of remote recording and pulled together so many talented VAs, bringing their best stuff.\n\nTrust me, I believe every anime viewer needs to experience this show at least once in their lives, sub or dub, doesn't matter. Both are fantastic. Akudama Drive was truely worthy of Anime of the Year contention in 2020. It's so good!",

Solid 8/10 for me. \n\nPSA: My special edition bluray (1st disk) had skipping and missing content errors and needed to be replaced through warranty. Make sure you watch it prior to your warranty expires!",

Everyone talks about how great the casting is (and I *wish* we got more cast lists like it in anime currently), but everyone's performance is top-notch and sounds cohesive with one another. Really fun stuff and definitely worth checking out if you haven't yet!",

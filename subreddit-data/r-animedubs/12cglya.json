They wanted to align the art style with the mobile game. Which made sense.) --- I think S2 or 3 probably look the best.  --- But... It was still well handled in terms of direction and production in general.  It was a good season. (My favorite season in order are S3, S2, S4, S1 - but S2 and S4 are close)",

Controversial take possibly but it's by far my favorite season. Maybe it's because of the Origami-centric arc.)  Ended up watching everything I could (The show was only through S2 at the time) - and played the VN's.  Read some of the source material.  Overall got really really into it.  Was never expecting that.    \n\n\nTohka is like... Not even in my top 6 of the DAL girls haha. But I understand her fandom.",

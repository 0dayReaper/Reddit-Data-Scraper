If she had at least gotten his name after he helped her out, then I could see \"I had my family's agents track you down by your name and find your school etc etc\" but she didn't. \n\nThat leaves either: the \"tracking you down even without knowing anything about you,\" the \"magically informed who you were,\" the \"just my intuition,\" or the \"I actually knew who you were beforehand through XYZ connection\" explanations.

Iirc, I heard it explained once as the market (not just isekais, but LNs and mangas in Japan in general) that no one is going to bother looking at some several paragraph blurb at the back of the book, or reading the first few pages. So authors basically put the tl;dr of the blurb *as the title* so it catches your eye. \n\nOf course, and this part's just my own theory, as the isekai genre in particular becomes more popular and the market that much more saturated, you need a more fantastical title to set yourself apart, leading to the current trend. Though it is also possible that this sort of title scheme is now just *the* trend for isekais and some other fantasy works, and people follow it *because* it's the trend.",

    "postText": "**Synopsis from MyAnimeList:**\n\n&gt;Beginning his first year of high school, all Matsuboshi Raidou wants is to make friends\u2014starting with the cute, tiny, and soft-spoken Reina Aharen, who sits right next to him in class. Unbeknownst to Raidou, Reina shares the same sentiment, but she has a problem. Awkward and timid, Reina is incapable of determining how chummy she has to be when approaching a person.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Due to Reina's complete inability to gauge personal space, the two struggle to spark their unlikely friendship, as even the simplest tasks like talking seem impossible for them. But despite the countless yet pointless challenges that hinder the pair, the overly imaginative Raidou will do whatever it takes to befriend the indecipherable Reina. \n\n[Previous Anime Dub Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animedubs/search/?q=author%3AAutoModerator%20AND%20title%3AAnime%20Dub%20Discussion%20-&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sr_nsfw=)",

Raidou is very likeable! he's not like the typical dumbass rom-com lead in personality or appearance. there's a lot of heart. I wish there was a second season because I was wanting so much more when it ended.",

That world is honestly way more fixable than ours. \n\nWith zero religious conflict, you can tackle that stuff relatively easily. I mean, just think what would happen if you snapped your fingers today and all evidence of religion just disappeared? Lots of people would no longer have a reason to fight. It's just an entire segment of belief and discourse that would just cease to exist. The range of conflicts that can happen in that world are basically the same as ours, except minus everything related to religion. \n\nAlthough, in the show's world, the emperor basically served the same function of worship as a god, so I don't really know if I'd say Mitoma fully granted his wish.

To me, the society of people in the show have a core, organized set of principals and beliefs that is rigorously structured and taught from birth. Everyone mutually agrees on whatever it is, and anyone that asks questions is either killed, shunned or ostracized. Norms are dogma and law, and any break from it is heresy.\n\nNow, all of that sure sounds like religion to me. So if you wouldn't call that religion, does that not cross whatever mental threshold you have to get above \"cult\"? How are you mentally labeling their belief system if you aren't viewing their actions as related to religion?",

Or for that matter, why doesn't Aniplex just allow the Monogatari series and Nisekoi to be dubbed? All the animes listed are far better than this shitty anime that's supposedly about \"working for a god in a godless world\".",

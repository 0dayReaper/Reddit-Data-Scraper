And I would argue that Crunchyroll isn\u2019t really Sonys success, sines they bought them. \nThis is a bit of topic but for example Sony fell off hard with digital cameras but they completely manage an 180 with the a7 series since they practically are market leaders now. Or PS3 flop to PS4 success, most success in modern gaming is from the PS4 and PS5 lags a bit behind.",

It's incredible to me how such an iconic anime series managed to get two dubs that are both absolutely atrocious in completely opposite ways.",

I'd caught up with the US dub release episodes that I knew of and, desperately searching in vain for more episodes on the internet, came across the Animax dubbed version. It was beyond atrocious to the point of being completely unwatcheable and remains seared into my brain as the single worst dub I've ever watched, and I mean, I watched Revolutionary Girl Utena dubbed.",

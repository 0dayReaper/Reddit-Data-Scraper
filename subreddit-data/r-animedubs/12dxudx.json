Had that not happened it would have been a fairly happy ending, with the opium destroyer and the main cast alive and going about their daily lives. In fact, it seems that Raizo could fade into anonymity as an artist.\n\nThat said, I don't think Raizo particularly minded dying. He seemed at peace was probably still suffering from the fact that he (directly and indirectly, respectively) killed his future father in law and wife.",

            "comment": "The show definitely wore its messages on its sleeve. Violence begets violence; revenge begets revenge. Raizo dying in the grand scheme of things probably makes the most sense. His life being ended in a bout of revenge effectively completes the loop.\n\nMore to the point, In the end, he couldn't quite escape his sins either. Even living out his life as an artist was more than likely a punishment for him.\n\nIt was an alright show in the end; but I think it was perhaps a bit too on the nose at points and it meandered for a little bit before the plot really settled in. I feel like I also missed something about the grand plot  somewhere along the lines. Never really felt like I had that true pull to resent the villains since they felt a bit wooden and one note.\n\nI'm appreciative that this didn't at least try to bash you over the head with how bad revenge is conceptually like anime tends to usually do.",

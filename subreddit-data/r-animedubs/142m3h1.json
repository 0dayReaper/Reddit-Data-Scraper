Between Demon Slayer and my most recent binge watch of Taisho Otome Fairy Tail (both of which are set in the Taisho era, but I think any pre-modern setting would be fine), I've just really got a craving. So, any suggestions?",

I thought the depiction of a group of children trying their best to live in tough times was really, well, I don't want to say \"charming\" but it was really good. Especially with Miyo doing whatever she can to get food. It's not pleasant. All the children are injured, and their de facto guardian has to prostitute herself every night to get food, but it's really moving. \n\nOn the side of our MCs, it was a really sweet idea that Hyakkimaru just got his hearing back and the first sound he hears that doesn't irritate him is a woman's singing. There was a really nice part where he's asking Miyo to sing and she insists she's not that good (which, you know, of course everyone does), but you can kind of imagine given her situation that there's a good chance she's not wrong. She must have some talent, but young as she is and in a war-torn land, I doubt she's had much chance to refine it. But of course, to Hyakkimaru, it doesn't matter because he doesn't  *know* what \"good\" singing is supposed to sound like. Hers is the first singing (or music at all) that he's heard, and he loves it. I thought that was really sweet.",

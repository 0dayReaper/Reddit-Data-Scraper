In Japan it's virtually impossible to get a handgun, and even if this used the source material's South Korea, it's still heavily restricted there, too. I guess South Korea does have mandatory military enlistment, but that's only for men.",

It sounds like Rinko's in control, and only knows what Raeliana knows because it was in the book.\n\nIn fact, in that scene, Rinko (pretending to be Raeliana) says she's never held a gun in her (Raeliana-the-book-character's) life.\n\nAlso, one of the ways to actually own a gun in Japan (or Korea) is to be a hunter.",

In her commentary about her bridal training, Rinko mentions how \u201cLuckily for her, Raeliana\u2019s been exposed to the cultures of high societies\u201d so everything came naturally. Personal knowledge and experience like that isn\u2019t something that you can learn or emulate from reading a few paragraphs of a novel. Especially when that novel has your reincarnated self as a side character who\u2019s already dead.\n\nSo when Raeliana/Rinko said she never held a gun before during the hunting scene, THAT was a lie she told to lower that guy\u2019s guard down.",

If there was such a thing as analogous development here, the steam engine would presage the automobile by about 100 years or so. If they start showing steam locomotives, then ok - cars could be a possibility. Beyond even that, the concept of automotive grade gasoline was about 10-15 years further down the road. Most early four stroke (Otto) engines (including the one in Carl Benz\u2019s Patentmotorwagen) ran on stuff that can best be described as cleaning solvent that didn\u2019t necessarily have to be petroleum derived.\n\nLastly, though her family are \u2018oil barons\u2019, I don\u2019t think they said what kind of oil barons. The United States had a myriad number of oil barons well before the first oil wells went up in Pennsylvania. Wouldn\u2019t surprise me of hunting those giant rock monsters for blubber (oil) is a thing.",

Chris, like many of his fellow VAs is just a big nerd who loves music, video games, gunpla, and wrestling. He's also a dad with three kids. He's a working and passionate professional who loves his job of voicing memorable characters from the rough and roughed, to the gentlemen kind, to main characters, and everything in between. Every day in the booth is just another play day for him. Def someone that's appeared in a lot of recent LA dubs.\n\nWhat are your favorite roles?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Yuito Sumeragi** (Scarlet Nexus)\n\n\\- **Tsumugu Kihara** (A Lull In the Sea)\n\n\\-  **Khun Aguero Agnis**  (Tower of God)",

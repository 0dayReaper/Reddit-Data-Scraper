Miller (in her next new anime role after Blue Period), Jennifer Sun Bell, Nichole Sakura and Rosalie Chiang. Honestly it\u2019s been a while since we had an Anime dub production done at Bang Zoom! that utilized a lot of celebrities since the *Laws of the Universe* films, cause usually the anime dub productions licensed by GKIDS and recorded at NYAV Post tend to do these kind of castings.\n\nFinally **THIS** is what I call a full on Union anime dub from Bang Zoom! by going \"out of the box\" on utilizing voice actors and occasionally celebrities they hardly utilize in their current Union anime dub productions.",

Miller is still doing new anime dub productions considering outside of her recent appearance in the *Blue Period* dub, most of her anime VO work had been relegated to reprisals of her previous roles such as Boruto (Boruto) and Sailor Jupiter (Sailor Moon) respectively and doing ADR Scriptwriting for dubs.",

They probably wanted to follow suit with Shinkai's new film when they got the rights to this over GKids. No big celebrity actors here though outside of who's voicing Suzume (and even then, she's not that big) but there are a greater presence of VAs who are more prominent in union productions. The dub for Shinkai's previous film had big celebrity talent like Alison Brie, Riz Ahmed and Lee Pace.",

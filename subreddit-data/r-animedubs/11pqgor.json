            "comment": "hold up there. The Bell lady said that Prospera was using her daughter as revenge for something from 20 years ago. Making the reasonable assumption that Prospera and Suletta are Elnora and Eri, and the something from 20 years ago was Episode Zero, that would make Suletta at least 27 years old. And she looks like a teenage schoolgirl. The fuck.\n\nSo... Clone, or suspended animation?\n\nBirthday songs in this show are literal death. First the enemy pilots Eri lit up in the prologue, and now Elan.\n\nSpeaking of Elan, I'm assuming those ghosts he saw before his suit got cut to pieces were the previous \"Elans\" whose consciousness were subsumed into the machine.",

For all we know Suletta thinks of Aerial as her sister. She did address her bits as \"everyone\" during that battle. Considering how technopathy is a big plot point in this series, that could be it.",

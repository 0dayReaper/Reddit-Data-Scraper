I mean the Kyle thing got everyone riled up, and I remember us sending crunchy all sorts of tweets, on every post they made. So what happened? Did they not respond? Did everyone eventually get tired, and gave up? Nice, it seems that the fans voices don't count for shit in the world of big business...",

            "comment": "Well considering Sony recently announced that Crunchyroll has 10.7 million paying users even with that controversy, yes, it's business as usual.\n\nSo far, voice actors that called out Crunchyroll still ended up reprising their roles except for Ben. That pretty much tells you everything. \n\nLastly, casual viewers don't know who voices who and it's the same for video games. As long the acting is good and the voice fits, it's all they care about.",

            "comment": "For what it's worth, I wholeheartedly believe the support the fans gave, the noise they made, and all the discussion around the subject made a definite impact. By the time I posted the video that... kind of lit the anime internet on fire, I had already made the decision to walk away from the role, and there was never a high likelihood anything was going to happen that would undo that. But the needle definitely moved in the right direction. I have no idea whether decision makers at Crunchyroll are any closer to considering a union contract some day or not (SAG-AFTRA remains open to discussing options with them), but it got the attention of the VO dubbing community at large, including people in a market we're working hard to get a foothold in. Galvanizing that community can make big things happen. So what you all did was far from fruitless. \n\nIt's also worth noting that this one incident was a small piece of a much larger puzzle, and believe it or not, the dubbing industry at large is moving in the right direction. Every dubbing project produced by Netflix has been on a union contract since late 2019. Aniplex has been doing the same with all of the content they spearhead production on for just about as long, even though it's all distributed by Crunchyroll. HBO Max, Disney+, Amazon, Paramount+ and others are all dubbing more and more foreign content into English every year, and the vast majority of that work is on SAG-AFTRA contracts. Ballpark estimate, I'd say we've grown from roughly 5% union density in this space to somewhere between 60-80% in the last 5 years. The union dubbing contracts being utilized today also have considerably more favorable terms than the ones that were in use 5 years ago. Non-union dubbing rates for every major employer have risen to match the gains made on those union contracts, as well. Most dubbing actors are earning nearly twice as much now as they used to for most of their work, and a good ~19% more for the rest of it. Most of them are now earning pension and health contributions they weren't getting, as well. It's still far less lucrative than most other types of VO, but things are absolutely improving.\n\nFor SAG-AFTRA dubbing proponents, Crunchyroll remains our white whale, but we are making meaningful progress in this space. And the support of fans is an invaluable tool in furthering that cause. Thank you all for everything you did and continue to do to make your voices heard on this subject. Whether you see the results immediately or not, you are absolutely making a difference.",

While we have you here, out of curiosity, why were you willing to be in the Fire Emblem Warriors game that came out right before all of this Mob Psycho III stuff happened? It's pretty well known that Fire Emblem is produced non-union, and it sounded like you had drawn the line in the sand against all non-union work, so I can't figure out the double standard here. Wouldn't pushing back against Nintendo, a video game company, potentially be even more lucrative than Crunchyroll? But I haven't seen a single tweet or video against Nintendo at all. I'd really appreciate your insight into this if you can share it because I haven't been able to wrap my head around it since your video came out.",

Though Suzume may have been dubbed in LA for a variety of reasons, such as Sony Pictures\u2019 direct involvement in distributing the film in English speaking markets (Europe, Oceania) outside of North America, the desire for a higher profile cast, etc.",

This sub, and people on social media that actually follows stuff like this, really over estimate how much the general public who watch anime really cares. Its like me with Western cartoons and video games, \"does it sound good? Yes? Cool\" and that's that. Most subscribers probably can't even name a single VA and just want to conveniently watch their entertainment in English. It was basically just a blimp on the radar. Honestly, I would bet that amount of people that cared or even realized McCarley was replaced was minuscule in the grand scheme of things.\n\nSo yes, CR just ignored it for a bit and went about their business.",

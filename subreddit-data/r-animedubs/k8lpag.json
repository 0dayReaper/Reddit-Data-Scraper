It's not a Dragon Ball Super situation here. The main reason for the Mugen Train arc to get adapted into a movie is that the arc is quite short. On the other hand, the next two arcs (&gt;!Entertainment District arc and Swordsmith Village arc!&lt;) are rather long. These two arcs require a 2 cour season just to themselves, and squeezing in the Mugen Train arc in that same season might cause pacing issues.\n\nIf you wanna know, Season 1 adapted 53 chapters. The Mugen Train movie adapted a 17 chapter arc. The next two arcs combined have 58 chapters total. So I don't think that Season 2 will readapt the Mugen Train arc.\n\nP.S. Initial D also did a very similar thing before. \"Initial D: Third Stage\" got adapted as a movie. But the next TV season \"Initial D: Fourth Stage\" picked up exactly where the movie ended and it didn't adapt what the movie already covered.",

She mimics the other sisters\u2019 VAs (also all amazing) so well not to mention bringing so much emotion into the character.",

            "comment": "No. 1 for me is **Brittney Karbowski**. It's hard to point to any particular role of hers as my favorite. But if I had to name one off the top of my head, I'd say **Mikoto Misaka** from *A Certain Magical Index / Scientific Railgun*. The fact hat she voices all versions of Misaka in that franchise (something the Japanese original didn't do) is amazing, and her performance as Misaka Worst was pretty much the one saving grace in the later parts of *Index 3* for me.\n\n2nd favorite would be **Sarah Williams**. She doesn't have as much of a track record, but damn, do I love her voice. A lot of the characters she plays end up as best girl (or at least 2nd best) of their respective show for me. For a top pick, I'd probably say **Sayu** from *A Lull in the Sea*, but that's in part because I love the show itself so much and found myself rooting for her super hard.",

Robert McCollum- Biases cause his Doflamingo from One Piece (favorite villain of all time) and also Stain from MHA and Sensui from Yu Yu Hakusho\n\n4. Christopher Sabat- Vegeta, Piccolo, Zoro, All Might and many more are some of my most favorite performances\n\n5. Laura Bailey- Even though she rarely does anime now, she did so well in her roles such as Kid Trunks in DBZ, Kushina from Naruto, a few in Bleach, and so forth\n\nHonorable mentions: Sonny Strait, Colleen Clickenbeard, Monica Rial, Ian Sinclair, Patrick Seitz, Stephanie Young, and I can go on.

Mainly his Okabe (Steins Gate) and Erwin (AoT). \n\n2) Erika Harlacher has a beautiful voice and also does great in her roles. Elizabeth (7DS), Violet (Violet Evergarden) and Shinobu (Demon Slayer) are my favorites.\n\n3) Cherami Leigh also has a pretty voice. Does great in all her roles.\n\n4) Matt Mercer has a smooth voice. Levi (AoT) is iconic\n\n5) Alex Le is current day Bryce Papenbrook. He is getting roles all over the place. He can be deep like Thorfinn (Vinland Saga) and eccentric like Zenitsu (Demon Slayer).\n\nHRs are Bryce Papenbrook, Tia Ballard, Lindsey Seidel, Bryn Apprill and Trina Nishimura. All great.",

The eng dub for Love Live is full of all star VAs, Caitlin glass, Kira buckland, Erica Mendez, Megan shipman, Jamie marchi, Sarah wiedenheft, kayli mills, jill harris, Lindsay Seidel, Lizzie freeman, Natalie van sistine, kristi rothrock and so many many more. If you\u2019ve only ever watched Love Live in sub check out the eng dub it\u2019s full of star power",

He's obviously from the family of the Sun Breathing technique, without question. His skill from the sword makes me think either \"fallen demon slayer\" or \"manipulated family reject.\" Either way, does that mean he knows the sun breathing technique? Because that would be insane. The day he meets Tanjiro is going to be a crazy episode, since Tanjiro is (as we just learned) not from the family. But I guess that gives us a second question: If Tanjiro's father was not our sun breather, then where did he learn his technique from and why does he think that's his father?",

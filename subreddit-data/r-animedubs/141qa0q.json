Then all of Steins Gate 0 followed by the last 3 episodes of steins gate. You can then watch the movie as well if you want but it\u2019s not a must. Fans of the series will enjoy it as a nice little way to cap things off though. Steins Gate 0 does have a bit of a different feel to it but without spoiling anything I\u2019d say it elevates the ending of the original much better if you view it before ep. 23-25. I felt that this made for a much more fulfilling experience and will continue to recommend watching it this way but to each their own. Regardless, Steins Gate is one of the greatest anime series\u2019 of all time and has a great dub. J. Michael Tatum\u2019s performance as Okabe is perfect. Enjoy!",

Due to time travel mechanics, the two timelines converge, and *0* is canon to the original story (unlike the \"Egoistic\" OVA or *Deja Vu* movie). The events in *0* occur before the original, but the first 23 episodes are the same in both timelines; you could say it's a prequel-sequel.\n\nAs for watch order, I did the release order method, and it worked perfectly fine: completing *Steins;Gate*, and then going to the \"23B\" OVA, and finally watching *0*; although the alternate watch order works too (as I have heard from some people on the subreddit): *Steins;Gate* episodes 1-22 -&gt; 23B -&gt; 0 -&gt; *Steins;Gate* episodes 23-24.\n\nAs for reception, *0* is divisive, but generally people like *0* even if it isn't considered as good as the original. Me personally, I love *0* as it fleshes out the main characters and adds a great supporting character in Maho despite its shortcomings in pacing and animation.",

Finally, I watched last 2 episodes of the original series, before jumping into the OVA \"Egoistic Poriomania\" and ending it off with the movie.\n\nWatching anything outside of the main show isn't necessarily vital, but watching it in this order helps the last 2 episodes of the main show feel like less of an asspull. Steins;Gate 0 also helped me appreciate the characters even more than I already did, such as Mayuri and Suzuha. Maho was also an enjoyable addition to the cast, and Moeka is just funny as fuck in 0 lol.",

I can't really judge that since I knew the ending from the start.\n\nPersonally, though, I recommend the split watch order (episode 23b, then *Zero*, then ep 23-24).

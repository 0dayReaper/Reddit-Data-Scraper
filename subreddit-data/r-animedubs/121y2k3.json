            "comment": "The bright spot of watching this show both subbed and dubbed is that while the former ended today, I still get two more weeks of the equally excellent dub! Haha\n\nNot only is the series as a whole an easy AOTS for me, I have to reiterate what I said a few weeks ago... I really think this is one of my new favorite simuldubs in a while. Even with the added restrictions a show like this would have compared to something less precisely animated, everything is really firing on all cylinders from the casting, direction, scriptwriting, etc...\n\nETA - Really curious who's the dub VA for Elendira the Crimson Nail. The character got a pretty drastic reimagining/design, but still seems to be agender.",

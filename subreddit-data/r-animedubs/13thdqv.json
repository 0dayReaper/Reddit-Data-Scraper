Her scars, how she\u2019s afraid of getting hurt, and how protective Groot is with her makes me think she isn\u2019t but I also don\u2019t think those are conclusive enough evidence either. Perhaps she\u2019s a demi-god?\n\nI wished the group would\u2019ve just asked Groot straight up what the heck she is. I\u2019m kinda annoyed that they didn\u2019t because it doesn\u2019t make sense for them not to. Still a vey well-written episode nonetheless though.",

At this point, all Gabimaru and Yuzuriha care about is finding the elixir and getting the pardon, and all Sagiri cares about is fulfilling her duty of monitoring Gabimaru. Senta's the only one who seems to have much of any interest in the specifics of the island. The other three really only care about potential threats on the island. Mei wasn't a threat, so they didn't pry. They probably just assumed she was blessed similarly to Groot, and that's why she's been alive so long.",

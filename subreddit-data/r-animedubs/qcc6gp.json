Not only that, it dropped early Thursday morning in Japan to reference the joke that Ishigami wakes up early Thursday mornings to buy Young Jump.\n\nNow, while I think we can expect Aniplex of America to eventually officially subtitle the PV, the bigger question is will Funimation be able to dub it? \ud83e\udd14",

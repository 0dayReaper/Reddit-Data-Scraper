Maybe it\u2019s super subtle but I\u2019m not hearing any difference. Maybe I\u2019m just missing it? Can someone explain please?",

            "comment": "... haven't watched this show subbed/in Japanese and don't have a particular desire to. (I found the second season to be dramatically worse than the first.) But my guess is it is something to do with regional dialect.  In Japan.  There are regional dialects and accents (just like with English in different regions... Countries... Etc.) So... Different words and expressions can mean different things.  Just my guess.\n\nI have friends in Japan.  And speak quite a bit of Japanese myself (still prefer dubs. Because I am natively an English speaker and would rather not be translating if I don't have to.) \n\nBut... Have friends closer to Sapporo. Some more like a couple hours north of Tokyo.  Some in Tokyo.  And have some more toward the Kansai region.  And... Yeah...  Sometimes I'll get confused about things. Because.  Wouldn't you know it.  Just like English.  There is slang and regional dialects in Japanese.  Surprising I guess for some.",

            "comment": "This can be really confusing but yeah. When he is talking to them he actually is using a more formal wording and they aren\u2019t used to him taking that way. Basically its the equivalent of you always saying sup or hi to your friends and then all the sudden saying, Hello or Greetings to you, if you want to really go into formalities, instead of the normal greeting you use. Same thing here, but the translation is just super simplified and no tonality of formality is applied to the line in the dub. Would have added more to the scene and made it make more sense but yeah they didn\u2019t do that. Would have been nice to see but not everyone can be crunchy roll or funimation.",

Formal vs informal, older vs young, leader vs follower, etc.\n\nThink about it like \"excuse me sir\" vs \"hey bro\" when trying to get someone's attention. It doesn't usually translate well into English. Some dubs will use European voices over more American to make the dialog make a small more sense",

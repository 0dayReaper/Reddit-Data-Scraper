I'll never get tired of Ian Sinclair charming, boarderline creepy, resonance.\n\nDef my favorite part of the ep, and surprisingly made me cry a little, was Mindaryn's beautiful ed song. I've always liked her songs in anime. This one was just something angellic. Especially with the lyrics speaking what I believe to be Raeliana's subtext",

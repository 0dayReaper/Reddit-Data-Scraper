The fourth wall breaks aren't necessarily, well, necessary, but it emphasizes that point.\n\nBut holy hell, episode 7 was terrible. What even was the point? The only piece of information we got was that Airi and Seiichi knew each other as kids and she had a crush on him. We could have learned that in any other way at any other time. Instead we got this forced death scene that just wanted to be creepy and throw in some Jojo (and Chio's School Road maybe?) references? When I say it was way over the top, I mean even for this show it was bad.\n\nPreview for episode 9 implies the Airi we saw might have been a doppelganger.",

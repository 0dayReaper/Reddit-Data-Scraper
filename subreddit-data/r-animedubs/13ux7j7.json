There's a chance that it goes up on Funimation instead, but what makes this more confusing is that this is an Aniplex of America release, and CR isn't involved in it whatsoever aside from the dub production. \n\nFor an example, the versions of SAO Alicization on Funi/CR last I checked were still the broadcast versions before Ted Sroka's Gabriel was redubbed by Greg Chun in the Blu-ray. The Blu-ray version of SAO Alicization is only available on Netflix.\n\nAlso, Darwin's Game and SK8 the Infinity, AoA shows which Funimation dubbed, don't have their Blu-ray versions on Funimation, despite the AoA Blu-rays having been out for a long time now.\n\nSo, honestly, I wouldn't exactly count on it unless if Aniplex puts Kaguya-sama on Netflix for some reason.",

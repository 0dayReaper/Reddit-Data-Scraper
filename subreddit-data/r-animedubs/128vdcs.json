GIRL!!!\n\nI think the line that resonated with me the most was \"just because someone has a special power, it doesn't make them a special person.\". And Ochako is right. Deku, despite the wonderous powers granted to him from OFA, he's just a kid. He started as a normal, quirkless kid. He's not invincible. He has feelings, emotions, limitations, and breaking points, all of which makes Deku very human and very relatable. \n\nAnd I think the world could use a dose of what MHA brings to us week to week. We are all human, we all have feelings, emotions, desires, and the capacity for love, life, and happiness. If we just took a step back and see that some of us may put on a brave face but are crumbling inside. Some of us look invincible but desperately need a break before shutting off entirely. If the world can embrace that part of being a hero, the world would be a much better place.\n\nFuck, I love this show so much\n\nI've experienced the highest of highs with this show. This season has made me the most emotional wreck I've ever been with any super hero media. This episode, coupled with last, man, MHA S6 2nd Cour has blown me too much away already.",

Luci Christian was amazing this whole episode I mean I think it\u2019s the best thing she has ever done in anything she is in. Like this is better then Nami with Luffy performance wise she really got to go for!\n\nAlso what an episode seeing Kota again just made me cry harder and the Kota said the SAME THING Deku said to him like that\u2019s good writing! Then Stain! What the hell is he going to do he is following All-Might!\n\nThis 6B has been amazing! Every episode has been A or S tier episodes! Cant wait to see how they end this season!",

Uraraka was definitely talking that talk and even though she was technically talking to everyone, her speech was dedicated to Midoriya. Something akin to the All Might point during the All For One fight.\n\n Shoutout to the entire Class 1A because while the adults are understandably down in the dumps, the young guns are pulling more than their own weight. Got the crowd to cave in and are the main reason everyone from cour 1 isn\u2019t dead and gone rn. 1A grew so much. They are the MVP\u2019s of this season fr\n\nIt\u2019s been a while so it never crossed my mind that Stain was the only major villain they didn\u2019t show during the breakout. Should be an interesting last episode.",

It gave the effect on Uraraka's speech that brought most of Class 1-A to tears and turned the protestors anger to shame and sympathy.\n\nI love how the bystander from the season 1 premiere helped in convincing the crowd after being convinced by Uraraka.\n\nTiny Uraraka is so kawaii.\n\nMidoriya who's already broken and nearly breaking even more from the protestors really hurt.\n\nIt was nice to see one of the protestors offer his umbrella to Midoriya in the end.",

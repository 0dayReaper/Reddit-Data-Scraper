    "postText": "I\u2019m curious to see what shows people pick but for me personally it\u2019s Hero Aca, JoJo, and AOT. I am bias saying that cause Hero Aca is my favorite ongoing anime currently and it\u2019s only show where I actually pay attention to the script cause I\u2019m watching Hero Aca subbed and 9/10 times I always prefer the dub\u2019s dialogue over the subtitles. But if I was to look at them objectively then I\u2019d say JoJo, Hero Aca, AOT. JoJo cause across 6 parts Bangzoom hasn\u2019t missed once and Part 4\u2019s dub was something special everyone involved was in G.O.D. MODE Vic, Billy Mathew, and Zach and DC Douglas especially stole the show easily one of my top 5 favorite dubs of all time and AOT the dub cast has really impressed me across S3 and S4 but the one constant across all 4 seasons is Josh Grelle he is the MVP of the AOT dub almost all the best performances of each season come from him",

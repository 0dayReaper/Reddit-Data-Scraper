It's nice if you elaborate a bit on what it is you like or don't like about a show.

            "comment": "Well, I know it's not technically anime, but like ATLA it's probably close enough. I watched **The Dragon Prince** and it was AWESOME. As someone who watched ATLA and LoK back in the day, I could obviously see the influence (and sometimes straight up references) all over the place. The show really does a good job of taking a lot of the best qualities of both of those shows and making something new and awesome.\n\nIt was a bit of a slow and sometimes overly silly start (against a kinda dark and serious backdrop), but again, knowing the target audience, and being familiar with ATLA it didn't really deter me. The CG animation is probably rough for some, but I didn't mind it outside of a few of the character animations. The rest of the production value seemed really good, and the VA performances were pretty great (folks more familiar with various non-American accents may disagree I suppose). The show is mostly a fun action/adventure romp, with a few romance storylines (why does anime struggle so much with doing good romance in predominantly non-romance genres?) and some cool world building and a diverse cast of (mostly) really good/fun characters. Can't wait for S5 and would definitely recommend **9/10**.\n\nI also watched **Dragon Pilot** this week. This show had a kind of weird concept, but it executes it pretty well imo. It was mostly a fun fantasy/sci-fi story with some military themes. It also has some drama and romance. The MC and the performance by Christine Marie Cabanos definitely carried the show for me though. The show never really stops being a bit weird, but for me, that was definitely a part of its charm. Honestly, I was kinda surprised the show was done by Bones, it really felt like it might have been something done by Studio Trigger. Anyways, it's definitely one worth checking out imo **8/10**.",

The show leans pretty heavily into fan service, but the animation is clean, the VAs are amazing, the characters are adorable, and the end credit song is perfection (seriously, I never skip the end credits).\n\nThe premise itself is incredibly stupid and ridiculous. To graduate high school, students are paired with other students of the opposite sex and forced to cohabitate as if they were married. Though they have separate rooms to sleep in, they share basically everything else AND they get points based on how lovey-dovey they can be. If this were the real world, this would incite so much legal, social, and possibly moral issues it may as well be a social nuke\u2026 but this is anime so reality was never really a factor.\n\nIf you want a romcom that will give you the feels, I\u2019d recommend giving it the three episode trial. And seriously, watch those end credits :)\n\nEdit: sorry, I\u2019m new to Reddit and don\u2019t know how to bold my text\u2026",

Even beating out season 3 of Kaguya: Love is War, which I certainly did not expect. It was refreshing to see a romance anime where the progress and development were actually moving at a rapid pace, instead of a slow burn, which is rather common in the genre.",

Older animes seem to be really hit or miss on the dubs but I feel like this is at least passable. I almost gave up on the anime in general after the first 2 episodes but I'm glad I stuck with it. I'll be finishing it today so I'm hoping the ending is decent. \n\nAlso, I'm excited for Farming Life in Another World. I believe the 1st episode dub is being released today. I'll be watching that and the next dubbed episode of Mashlee (I think it's episode 3).",

            "comment": "Busy week for me in the dubbed anime sphere.    \n\n\nFINALLY watched **Princess Principal** and all of the movies that currently exist.  I had tried to watch it like twice in the past but wasn't really in the mood for this style of anime.  BUT... Really really REALLY am happy I finally did watch it.  If you love Action, Spy Thriller, Steampunk, and an amazing anime art style... With possibly one of the best dubs out there.  (I LOVE how they have the correct accents for all the characters.) - Then you will love this.  Ange might be one of the coolest anime characters I've seen in a while.  Loved everything about this.  Highly recommend it.  WILL watch again.    \n\n\nWatched **Lookism,** which is technically \"Anime Styled\" vs an actual anime.  But... It is still on MAL - so... Anime.  And..  Quite liked this one also.  Deals with some pretty interest topics that can definitely hit hard.  Even if you haven't experienced it, you can understand and relate to it.  But... Was still a fun ride.  I definitely wanted more.  I hate that netflix does these like \"half cour\" seasons with anime sometimes.    \n\n\n**Just Because!** \\- Because WHAT should be the better question.  I haven't decided if this will be an outright drop from me or if I will go back to it.  But I was literally falling asleep watching this one.  I enjoy slice of lifes and romcoms and the sort.  But this one was a complete and utter bore.  I gave it 3 episodes and said.... I need something else.  Maybe it's just my mood right now when it comes to anime?  But, this was just not very good.   \n\n\nContinuing shows:   \n\n\n**Megumin**, which I commented about on the weekly.  You can already tell we're getting CLOSER to getting caught up to actual Konosuba (as this is a prequel) because things megumin are doing... Have throwbacks to konosuba.  Setups to things that happen that you go ohhhhhhh.  I love stuff like that in prequels.  Enjoying it.  It isn't as good as BASE Konosuba, which I think works better with a full supporting cast.  But I do like it a lot.  And Megumin still is my favorite Konosuba character. (And one of my favorite anime characters in general.)  \n\n\n**Danmachi** \\- I wrote pretty extensively about the new season in the weekly post and how I appreciate how much more narrow and consise the show has gotten.  Danmachi has a tendency to get overly bloated.  This season has narrowed it down and really just focus on the best characters and the ones that people want to see more of.  Love that.    \n\n\n**Oshi No Ko**  \\- All I will say is... I want. No.  Need more.  CLIFFHANGER CITY.  This past episode felt more like a prelude to a bigger episode.  Gimme more.",

It doesn't actually have much SoL. It's more of a straight up Romantic Drama, but it's not super dramatic nor overly romantic. I kinda qualify it mentally as a character/relationship melodrama.\n\nThere's some really good scenes (and I feel like I remember really liking the soundtrack), but yeah. That whole muted atmosphere thing at the beginning is a bit of a hurdle. It doesn't ever totally go away, but the story got much more interesting as the characters and relationships developed.\n\nEdit: grammar",

I'm not sure how I feel about that.  But by the end it makes perfect sense.  This show is a CHARACTER focused show.  The characters matter more than the overall story.  So the way the show is told allows it to put focus on the characters and develop them. Once you realize that. You appreciate it more.  That's the only advice I give going into it.\n\nOshi No ko man.  I just feel like I miss it when it's gone.  I can't even put my finger on what I like about it so much.  Even without the hype (and trust me.  Hype has never gotten me with anime. I have disliked many very popular anime). I would find this show amazing. And I'm not even 100% sure why.  It's just fantastic.  The characters I suppose. And the mystery. The intrigue.",

I prefer chronological order, but it's not a deal breaker - I'll just have to make sure I pay attention to the details to keep the timeline straight in my mind. \n\nI think for me, the thing that makes Oshi no Ko so fantastic is the characters combined with that element of mystery. I care about them and want to know what happens next in their story, and the suspense just heightens that effect even more. The hype got me to give it a chance, but the show's own good qualities are what made it a new favorite.",

Shows that are a decade old or older.\n\nI watched the original 1997 **Berserk** show this past weekend, and man that show was great. The dub was great too, although the words wasn't matching up with the lips sometimes. But that show was something else...and that last episode was insane man I'll never forget it. Sheesh. I was thinking about checking out the 2016 and 2017 Berserk shows since I think those continue the story past where the 1997 show ends, but apparently those shows are nowhere near as good so I dunno if I'll ever bother checking them out. I also thought about maybe reading the manga, but it's super long and I heard the author of the story died (RIP) so the story will never be completed, which is too bad.\n\nI started **Fate/Zero**. I don't know how much I plan on getting into the Fate series since there's like a thousand different things to watch, but I figured I'd at least check out Zero and then check out Stay Night. As for Zero, I've completed season 1. It's been good so far, definitely expecting some crazy shit to go down in season 2. The dub is great as well.\n\nThe last show I've checked out this week is **Future Diary**. I've been putting this one off for a long time since I've heard mixed things about it, but man I'm really enjoying it so far. I'm on episode 15 right now. The dub is pretty good.",

The last two episodes were surprisingly emotional with &gt;!Tsukasa's redemption arc, and reviving his little sister only for him to sustain a near-fatal injury to protect her!&lt;. So glad I decided to catch up with this one before the season was over because it's been an exciting watch. *Rating: 8.5/10* \n\nI'll actually catch up in time to follow the new episodes starting this week! Really looking forward to all the hints about where the story is going, like &gt;!finding out the how and why of the petrification, and how to replicate its effect!&lt;. The special episode between seasons 2 &amp; 3 wasn't on Funimation and I don't have Crunchyroll anymore, so I just read a plot summary and I'll be starting season 3 tomorrow.",

Also I thought at first that the brother complex the sister has  would really bother me, but it actually doesn\u2019t because it\u2019s actually pretty minimal (to me at least).",

            "comment": "I watched **Violence Jack** last night. For the love of God, do *not* watch **Violence Jack**. I went into this expecting some fun gory schlock like M.D. Geist or Apocalypse Zero. What I got was an anime that's mostly boring with a disgusting amount of SA tossed in for (I hope) pure shock value. Also, the obligatory evil lesbian who commits most of the aforementioned. There's no fun to be had with this one, so gorehounds look elsewhere.\n\nAs for the dub, it's exactly what you'd expect from Manga UK. Nothing noteworthy, especially since the title character has a grand total of one line.",

            "comment": "Finally watched Trigun Stampede. Absolutely hate the CG art style but after a few episodes stopped noticing it since the story and narrative is so good. I liked all the characters too except for Vash. I absolutely hated how they wrote Vash here. He is usually gloomy and mopey and I think they were going for a man with the weight of the world on his shoulder but absolutely missed the mark. Overall if you are expecting a remake of the original you will be very very disappointed but if you just watch it was a show on its own, its pretty good.",

This show has gotten much better with this second half.  \n\nMy issues with Danmachi is that it gets over bloated with characters at times. And some characters you just don't even care about much. (Either they aren't well written... or there are just too many characters to pay attention to them all.)  Plus.  It sometimes feels like the stakes are overall low.  \n\nThis second half.  The show seemed to realize sometimes less is more.  It raised the stakes.  And put the two most interesting characters on the show (Bell and Ryu) into an absolutely terrible situation.  It also kept the focus more narrow rather than just having a million things going on.  The tension has been way higher as well.  I just love what they have done with the show.\n\nHad a conversation with someone on here a few episodes ago that this show is fun but forgettable at times.  You can literally forget what happened in past seasons if you don't watch recaps or rewatch.  This season has seemingly been more memorable because it's more narrow and focused.",

The anime likes to over explain things to the viewers and repeat things that already been said by another character or has been implied through actions or situations. I think it's the classic padding of time to fit the 20 minutes, 24 episode format. IMO, it takes away from the urgency and tension.",

But for packing Tsukasa's first time at Muffyland, Chitose and maids having fun and spying on them, as well as the Ms. Yanagi and Mr. Taniguchi romance side plot, the ep felt very appropriately paced. Was able to enjoy the fun and wholesomes of each group.\n\nLoved seeing everyone having fun, especially Tsukasa. Was cheering for Mr. Taniguchi to have the perfect date and opportunity to get Ms. Yanagi to like him. And of course Chitose is a blast.\n\nGreat ep. This show is once again doing what it's done in the first season: make me feel the warmth and fuzzies after every episode to extreme.",

I thought he'd fail which would scare Taniguchi. I love how Naoko ends up unintentionally initiating the handholding and the confession. Who voiced Taniguchi again opposite Suzie Yeung?\n\nI hope we get to see more Taniguchi and Naoko moments and maybe see their 1st kiss.\n\nI never saw a buffet place when I went to HK Disneyland multiple times and to Paris Disneyland once but fuck that looks good.\n\nThe play-by-play by Tsukasa and Nasa about Taniguchi and Naoko was hilarious.",

And then the movie will cover volumes 12 and 13 (Holy Kingdom arc)?\n\nOr maybe season 4 will follow pattern of doing 3 volumes, so s4 will give us first half of Holy Kingdom and then the movie concludes it?\n\nAnyone that has read the light novels. Which of these seems more likely?",

If they tried to cover both books with one movie it will need to be 3 hours minimum to faithfully cover the arc. The issue is that the POV character has to be introduced and must fully developed to cover the whole arc. This is one of the peaks of the whole narrative so far, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to give books 10-11 extra space while cutting books 12-13 down.",

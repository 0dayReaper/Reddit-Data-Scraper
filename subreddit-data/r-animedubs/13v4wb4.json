The fact that Ketil isn\u2019t actually the Iron Fist Ketil, makes a lot of sense. I have a feeling Pain is going to be a pretty accurate title for the next episode.\n\nEdit: Here\u2019s [Episode 18.5](https://youtu.be/GUlTTqc4peM) an extra scene showing Ketil\u2019s speech right before the episode. Hopefully they\u2019ll eventually get to dub these extra scenes for the Blu-Ray (although the first .5 episode had basically no dialogue).",

The previous VA sounded more unique, had this rough and tough voice that made Thorgil sound unhinged and ruthless and also managed to fit his appearance better. New voice is just Chris Wehkamp trying to sound big and muscular. It's not bad...but the voice feels a bit forced and doesn't work quite as well.",

Ironically enough, the voice sounding forced is my exact complaint with Thorgil in the Netflix dub which, perhaps by sheer comparison, made me love his previous CR voice so much more. Nothing against Thorgil's actor in the Netflix dub, I understand he's a relative newcomer. \n\nEpisode 12 is such a clear indicator, Thorgil hyping up Olmar is super intense in CR and doesn't have near that amount of impact in Netflix. And then also when Ketil shows up, in CR Thorgil gives a super natural \"Dad, I'm gonna need you to calm down.\" whereas in Netflix it's \"STOP! Just hang on FATHER.\" and it sounds super stilted. So anyway yeah, CR Thorgil suddenly now sounding forced (and saying Father instead of Dad, small thing) is a bit of a bummer. And I wish there was at least an explanation.",

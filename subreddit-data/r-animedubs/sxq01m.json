I\u2019m so excited for the second season, I\u2019ll still read the light novel, but having the anime will be fun.",

My issue is with how they adapted the rest of things. Horikita\u2019s resolution with Ike and the others was gone from the first arc, making it seem pointless. The confrontation in the second arc felt kind of clich\u00e9 in the anime. The pool story was adapted, but because they put it before the third volume instead of later in the second season it loses its purpose. The end of the season was actually good though. While they moved the monologue to the very end, it made for a good cliff hanger, even if that scene leaned into making Horikita too cute.",

If they didn\u2019t introduce her, that\u2019s one thing, but they took some of her roles/parts and gave it to another character. Some of those scenes I felt were important for character development/relationships/etc. so that does hurt the anime adaption for me a bit.\n\n\nBut I still think the anime adaption was really enjoyable overall (I watched the anime first then read the LNs) and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as bad as everyone says it is. If you don\u2019t know about them changing stuff like that, it\u2019s even better.",

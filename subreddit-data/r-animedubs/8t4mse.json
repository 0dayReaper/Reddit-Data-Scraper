The perfect example would be Asta from black clover. EVERYONE knows that guys acting is shit in the sub.\n\nEven though I'll be downvoted to hell, I'll just state some of my favorite dubs, one being the haruhi suzumiya series, more recently the Grimoire of Zero, black lagoon, hero aca and the attack on titan series.",

            "comment": "I like reading subs, especially for older shows with abysmal dubs I prefer the sound to match the visuals more. That is to say I hate the Speed Racer effect where the voice actor has more/less time to speak due to the difference in word length and everything sounds stilted. \n\nDubs can be fine, I saw Trigun dubbed first, same for GunxSword and both are excellent. My wife and I got like 2 episodes into FullMetal Alchemist before we switched to subs because the dialog was so busted. \n\n I definitely think translation matters as well as idiom density. \n\nSubs translating what the Japanese words mean usually express idioms better , but have crippling issues when the show itself was trying to leverage Western idioms. Gurren Laganns use of \"Aniki\" as a sort of brother-friend-soulbonded kind of relationship simply is not well encapsulated by the word \"Bro\"( which is what appeared in my dub) and suffers for the loss. Meanwhile Black Butler tries to use \" Yes, My Lord\" in English along with several British locations and ideas, but stumbled pronouncing it and generally makes the attempted catchphrase cringeworthy. \n\nDubs display strength if they handle foreign words by simply borrowing them(English is way more comfortable with this anyway) like Bleach straight lifting \"Zanpakuto\" rather than trying to express the whole \"sword with a personality\" schtick in English. In the same show they translate \"Shinigami\" to Soul Reaper because that concept maps well and sounds good .\n\n\nIn my experience Dubs always change things more in terms of what's being said and how it's said.\n\n If I had to explain it, I'd say Subs as normally provided are usually a near direct word for word translation and usually don't tweak the meanings of things too much. \nDubs done right can maximise the effect of words by translating concepts to be more familiar to the audience and leave them feeling better connected. Dubs done wrong make everything stilted and unrealistic as people speak nonsense phrases and express ideas using language that doesn't support it. ",

I find that weird as even most subtitles seem to translate words (such as the official subtitles of Gurren laggan, which does translate Kaminas relation to Simon as \"Bro\"). I understand some content is lost with translation choices like this but even if you understood the content of specific words in other languages you are still viewing it through the context of English, I'm which these words simply don't exist. There isn't any perfect solution here but most dubs seem to get by with some smart dialogue changes. ",

                            "comment": "I guess for me, hearing another word and reading the approximate translation let's me build a new meaning in my head. I don't speak Japanese but I can assemble a definition of \"Aniki\" by seeing the translation to \"Bro\" and inferring from use. I, in some limited way, added \"Aniki\" to my vocabulary and can use that in my head to represent the relationship of Simon to Kamina. I can do that to some extent with \"Bro\" by sort of always translating it in my head, but it feels more like work and it detracts from the character of the show by adding this weird linguistic quirk. I don't like adding another meaning for a word I know, I like linguistic precision where one word means one thing. I mean this regarding my vocabulary, i can't change the language but if I know one word to express something I'll always prefer it to using a word that could mean something else. \n\nI like Dubs to use Japanese words for things that don't translate smoothly. Again \"Soul Reaper\" translates quite well but since a \"Zanpakuto\" is made up, naming it in English will be awkward and unnecessary since loanwords are such a part of English anyway. If we call them Soul Swords and name \"Shikai\" and \"Bankai\" as something like Power level 1 and 2, it loses something for me. \n\nMy feeling is that if you translate certain words, especially if you aren't sensitive to the nuance of the meaning of the word, you end up paving over the concept expressed because we import the meaning from the translated words. In some cases I prefer to get a new word that I can map one to one with the new concept. \n\n As I tried to say above, it's hit or miss and with Subs I think you take no chance and tend not to disrupt things. Dubs can improve on that by grounding familiar concepts and carefully selecting words to be brought over instead of translated. They can also whiff by using mundane words for completely new concepts or bringing every word in regardless. \n\n\nI think dubs are more risky but often higher reward, and I like subs because that's not me. I like language and I have a good time comparing the English to the Japanese, so the risk isn't worth it to me. \n\n\nAdmittedly though, Subs can be really weak for name association in some cases. Some shows with a lot of characters leave me in the dust there. \n\n I also find the quality of the Dub matters as well as the show itself. Trigun dubbed well but I couldn't endure Gurren Lagann dubbed, and I watched it on Netflix so i assume the Dub was decent. ",

If you're engaging in criticism, using absolutes just makes you sound like you don't know what you're talking about. This conversation is a valuable one to have, maybe more valuable than OP realizes, but it needs more nuance and less of *this*.\n\n&gt;You just shit on English dub because you think listening in Japanese makes you feel intelligent\n\nThis sentence is constructed extremely poorly. You *think* it makes you *feel* intelligent? Ignoring that, this is a complete strawman - almost nobody thinks this. Stop propagating this absolute fallacy. For what feels like the milllionth time on this sub, allow me to say: **Engage with genuine criticism of dubs, not fallacious strawmen that are easy to discredit.** This part of the image is pure projection.\n\n&gt;And you can't tell bad acting by a language you can't speak\n\nThis is another fallacy that might make people feel good but it just isn't true. Acting is believably portraying a character, it can be judged without intricate knowledge of a language. Also how can English and Japanese dubs be as good as each other if you're unable to honestly critique the Japanese one? This post is entirely self-defeating.\n\nBefore anyone says it, yes, this is probably a joke image (though it would be troubling otherwise) but the idea that it's at all representative of the state of the industry, discourse on dubs, or how language works is completely absurd and I'm gonna keep calling these ridiculous arguments out on here until I get banned.\n\nBe better.",

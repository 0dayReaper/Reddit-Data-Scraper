It explained the story perfectly and carried the cheese with it plus it didn't mess with what made the games famous.\n\nFrom sailors to Charlie and Lan Di still being a massive A-Hole. It's all there. \n\nOnly issues is that the brand will be huge so it wasn't successful enough for a second season even though it was planned and was considered a good adaptation.\n\nPlus it squashed two games into one season which meant that stuff was cut out or changed to work in the anime. That worked in this case but it could have been improved had they had time to flesh out the games into two seasons.",

    "postText": "# Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth - Episode 17: The Price Of Resolve\n\n**[Dub on Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/watch/G31UXZJ24/the-price-of-resolve)**\n\nI like how the battles are, at least from overheard, groups of soldiers in formation bashing against other groups of soldiers in formation. None of that terrible solo charges deep into enemy lines.\n\nI feel bad for Maororo.\n\nThe third party enemies made this a little more interesting.",

Two Isekai in a row for her, only now she's playing a boy and is utterly OP! \n\nNone of the main girls are casted yet but that's probably because they haven't shown up yet, not that it isn't nice to see Kristen McGuire and Natalie Rose though.",

It would probably come up with something like that LOL.\n\nThat said... I'll probably still watch it.  Because I'm a sucker for Isekais.  I'm the guy they keep making bad isekais for who keeps watching them even when I know they'll likely be lousy haha.",

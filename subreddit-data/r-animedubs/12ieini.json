RE7 should've widened the scope, expanded on the revolutionary movement and A.I. partner system, and included an ensemble cast of all the iconic series characters that Capcom forgot about but instead what followed that action packed game with insane explosive set pieces...was a slow boring story of a random guy searching for his wife and another game of him searching for his daughter...\n\nAs someone whose favorite games are 5, 6, and Revelations 2, stuff like Death Island is what I wish most modern RE content was like (should note that I didn't watch the trailer as I didn't want to get spoiled on anything). Unfortunately the CGI movies are the only place Capcom can do these sort of things nowadays. I've loved basically every one they've released and I'm glad they're still making them. I hope they continue to do so, as it's the only way we'll get to see people like Rebecca lmao.",

Guess it comes down to Sony Pictures not being cheap and anti-union like Capcom",

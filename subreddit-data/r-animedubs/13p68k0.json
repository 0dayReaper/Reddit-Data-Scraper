Once you get past everyone\u2019s inappropriate yet hilarious reaction to food, the plot and characters are pretty good! If you haven\u2019t watched it, do yourself a favor and check it out (but maybe wear headphones).\n\nWhat I hate is that it has ruined anime food for me \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m just now getting to Restaurant to Another World (another great show) and every time I see someone eat something good (which is a lot), I have these stupid Food Wars expectations and it makes me laugh in frustration.\n\nThank you for letting me rant. Enjoy your meal.",

It's not all good news though, because the project head and director, Yasuhiro Takemoto, died in the arson. Naoko Yamada (A Silent Voice's director) was his heir during her early career at KyoAni, and so she may take over the project once they finish their restructuring.",

A plagiarism office looked into the accusation after the attack and declared that no infringement was done by KyoAni, and that the script never even made it past their first round of filtering. The attack was also an attempted (and failed) suicide aswell.",

It was only moderately reported on for the first 24 hours of the incident and then they moved on.\n\nThe only place I know of prominently in the West that kept focused on it outside of the anime community was the pro-2nd Amendment community in the United States. Lots of gun blogs were pretty enraged the Western MSM moved on so quickly and said if the massacre had been committed with a gun instead of fire, it would have been wall-to-wall news coverage for weeks. Especially since this incident was the single biggest loss of life done by a single person's deliberate action since World War II.",

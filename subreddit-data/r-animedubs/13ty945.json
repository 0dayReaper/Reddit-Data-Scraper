Person of color doesn't just mean darker skin individual, for a lack of a better word it just means non-white (or more specifially non-European)",

I do wish for Wendee Lee to make a return ideally since i like her voice. Though if that can't happen, I'd like the new voice actor to sound as close to her as much as possible (while obviously giving her own take and flaire) like Chad voice actor does for Price. In fact, Chad has had 3 voice actor so far and the new one sounds like the perfect mixture of both the original Chad and Jamieson Price.",

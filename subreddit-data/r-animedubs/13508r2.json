    "postText": "Of all the anime with multiple English dubs, I've found Akira to be among the most intensely-debated and polarizing. Dragon Ball Z is the only other I can think of with significant debate, but whereas the Dragon Ball franchise has several different dubs spread across multiple entries, episodes, and other media, Akira is a single film with just two English dubs. Comparing the two Akira dubs is a simpler task.\n\nWhat I find intriguing about the Akira dubs is both have fans, but it seems rare to find people who legitimately like both. Both dubs are considered good by their respective fans and the other is considered bad. This includes myself - I prefer the first English dub distributed by Streamline Pictures in 1989 and dislike the second English dub distributed by Pioneer Entertainment in 2001.\n\nIt would be easy to chalk this up as people simply preferring the version they heard first and became used to, but I don't think it's that simple. If one dub was just bad, it normally wouldn't have developed a fanbase. If one dub was actually good, it normally wouldn't have so many detractors. The \"nostalgia factor\" - which can be levied against both dubs - doesn't account for the arguments made by both sides for why they consider their preferred version better. Personally, I saw the two dubs in their entirety about a day or two apart from each other and my preference of the Streamline dub derived from comparing them as much as I could. But there always seems to be case to be made for either dub.\n\nIdeally, with both dubs available on current home media releases, people should be able to judge both dubs fairly and perhaps appreciate both. But I don't think that will happen. Part of the issue is the Streamline dub is harder to access due to not being on streaming platforms, which is the norm now. However, from analyzing these dubs, I've come to the conclusion they were intended for different audiences.\n\nThe Streamline dub was created when anime didn't have a dedicated fanbase in the US. As a result, it was made for those who would be interested in such content at the time - film buffs and animation fans. It was done in the style of American animation at the time, right down to being directed by Wally Burr, the voice director of the original Transformers and G.I. Joe series. There was more freedom to the performances, the voices focused on the personality of the characters, and the script prioritized localizing the Japanese dialogue for the English-speaking audience.\n\nThe Pioneer dub was created after anime developed a fanbase in the US, which led to a new direction for English dubbing. As such, it was made for this new core audience - the dedicated anime fanbase. The performances focused more on realism, the voices matched closer to their Japanese counterparts, and there was a higher priority on translating the Japanese script to be more faithful to the original audio.\n\nNeither approach is wrong - just better suited for different audiences. I consider myself a film buff, which would explain why I prefer the Streamline dub. Others prefer the Pioneer dub's approach and I prefer the Streamline dub's approach. The two dubs are their own thing.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the two Akira dubs were made for different audiences? And is there any chance of future viewers being able to appreciate both instead of continuing the debate?",

And is there any chance of future viewers being able to appreciate both instead of continuing the debate?\n\nFor the former, I wouldn't doubt it based on the time period and how you described the two. For the latter, not a chance. The anime community makes a 100-year war out of everything.\n\nI only watched the Pioneer/Animaze version so I can't draw an actual comparison, but how do the scripts between the two compare in a technical sense? Cause I'd say for the one I watched, its commitment to absolute accuracy in that aspect severely crippled the script's pacing and the actors' performances. A grand majority of the dialogue isn't modified to flow with the movie, so everyone has to constantly drag out or squash their line reads together. This even happens in scenes without any lip flaps to sync up to. \n\nI think the only set of characters that don't really have this problem are the mutant children and Kei for the most part. And they're the characters that speak the slowest.",

                    "comment": "It's unfortunate the debate over these dubs will continue. I think if people gave both of them a fair chance, they would see positives in both.\n\nWhen it comes to how the scripts compare in a technical sense, I find the Streamline dub has actors who sound more natural and free-flowing in their performances because they're not directly following the Japanese script. I actually re-watched the Pioneer dub a few days ago and I noticed there's a lot more Speed Racer-esque acting than I remembered.\n\nThe Streamline dub manages to mostly avoid this style of acting, which I think is pretty commendable for an English dub of its era. However, there are also more missed lip flaps in the Streamline dub - they're not frequent, but they do become more noticeable on repeat viewings and / or if you've seen the Pioneer dub. I get the sense dubs back then were still having difficulty balancing natural performances and matching all the lip flaps. And it was especially difficult to do this with Akira when the lip flaps were animated after the Japanese actors' mouth movements.\n\nThe rewrites in the Streamline dub vary for me and I really don't have a preference over the scripts. Some make the story a little harder to follow - for example, Kaneda says \"So, Tetsuo wants a bike?\" in the Streamline dub instead of \"I'm gonna go send Yamagata his wheels\" before he crashes Yamagata's bike. This muddles Kaneda's reason for destroying the bike. On the other hand, Kaneda tries to goad Tetsuo into physically fighting him by saying \"Fight like a man!\" in the Streamline dub, which sounds more realistic than \"Fight with your bare hands!\".",

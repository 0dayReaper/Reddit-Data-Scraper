            "comment": "It's interesting that Netflix opted using Igloo Music who is known for their foreign Live-Action dubs (particularly their South Korean and Japanese series) to dub *Uncle from Another World* over their usual studios they utilized for their anime dubs (e.g. Iyuno Los Angeles, VSI Los Angeles, Bang Zoom!, Studiopolis and NYAV Post (until 2022)). I initially thought VSI Los Angeles was set to dub *Uncle* considering that one of the European dubs (French or German) for this series was recorded at one of their VSI branches in Europe, which usually have the majority of the Netflix Anime to be recorded at VSI LA for their English dubs. But I guess schedule conflicts from VSI Los Angeles or one of Netflix\u2019s NP3 recording studios and the anime's delay within Japan led to the anime being dubbed at Igloo Music instead.\n\nOn top of that, it's worth noticing that although *Uncle* is Igloo's 3rd anime dub production after *Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop* and *Bright: Samurai Soul* respectively in 2021, this is Igloo's first anime series to be dubbed while the aformentioned titles (*Words Bubble up Like Soda Pop, Bright: Samurai Soul*) were anime films.\n\nFinally, say what you will on the voice actors that were utilized within the dub but l love the voice cast for the dub of *Uncle from Another World* as just like *Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop* and *Bright: Samurai Soul* they utilized some familiar asian voice actors in this such as Aleks Le, Jenny Yokobori, Courtney Lin, Andrew Kishino, Victoria Grace and Feodor Chin, the latter who was in *Overwatch* and in his first anime dub. Finally, let\u2019s address the \"Elephant in the Room\" cause while most of the voice actors in the dub are Asian it did manage to utilize some non-asian actors under as additional voices such as Jas Patrick and Crispin Freeman, the latter of which I'm surprised to see him in a non-Bang Zoom! production considering for the past 3-5 years, the vast majority of Crispin Freeman's Union anime voice work has been primarily at Bang Zoom! and to a minor degree NYAV Post (in certain productions) instead of at the other LA studios like Studiopolis, VSI Los Angeles, and Iyuno Los Angeles. So hopefully Crispin starts branching out to other LA studios for more Union anime dubs instead of having him mostly do his Union anime VO work at Bang Zoom!.",

How did this turn into all-Asian or mostly-Asian casting? Why are we continuing to shut out black and Latino voice actors for roles they are capable of playing? \n\nI don\u2019t care about white voice actors. Most of them have made it clear they\u2019re okay with being last priority on casting. If they\u2019re fine with that so am I.",

Shouldn't we be celebrating more Asian actors getting prominent roles rather than decrying the supposed possibility that they will \"take over all dubs\" from other non-Asian actors?\n\nBut of course, you need to view it that way so you can think yourself as having some moral high ground and fearmonger the pathetic and racist concept of \"minorities overthrowing the whites\" cause that's what your nonsense boils down to.",

If my quick look on Wikipedia is correct, it was only the Genesis in NA.  That's why I find it odd, considering the visual as well.  If the text on the console had appeared in Japanese then I could see them going either way.",

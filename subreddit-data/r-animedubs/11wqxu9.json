As it turns out, the house belongs to Taki Toru, and they work together to clean her warehouse where her grandfather studied youkai. Natsume accidentally breaks a seal that Taki's late grandfather made to trap a dangerous kimono youkai. The three of them race around the house to find its misplaced limbs before the youkai does--its power will be returned upon completing its body._",

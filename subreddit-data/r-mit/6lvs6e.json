    "postText": "\"Dear XXX,\n\nI wrote last month that significant change is needed in Senior House.\nPresident Reif, Provost Schmidt, Vice President Zuber, and I made that\ndecision together.\n\nThe reaction from the Senior House community has reinforced our decision.\nThe misinformation, denials, and responses \u2013 online, in emails, and in\nperson \u2013 violate MIT values. We no longer believe that first-year and\ncontinuing students living in Senior House next year will be able to define\nfor themselves their own community values and living experience.\n\nThis has led us to conclude that our plan to re-set the undergraduate\nexperience in Senior House is unworkable. Senior House is now closed to\nundergraduates, and it will reopen in the fall to graduate students. We\ncontinue to stand by our responsibility for providing all MIT students with\nsafe residential environments, and we intend to fulfill that obligation.\n\nYou recently received your alternate fall housing assignment. If you have\nany questions or concerns about dining, financial aid, work study or any\nother topic associated with moving, please do not hesitate to contact David\nRandall or Jennifer Hapgood-White at residential-support@mit.edu.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCynthia Barnhart\nChancellor\n\"",

My current understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that Pilot 2021 was a plan to address to the dangerous behavior, graduation rates, etc in SH; probably homogenizing culture as well. So, what made them give up on Pilot 2021 and go nuclear?

Depends on what they're used for, right?  what do you think protest signs are made of?\n\nMaybe Reif should've said we are each our own user or something along those lines, but the conceit let him include the keynote speaker and make a bunch of fun puns.  This whole \"MIT is turning its students into products\" thing is pretty frustrating, tbh.\n\nThat said, I'm nitpicking about the speech.  100% with you on the loss of Senior Haus being a tragedy, yet another hamhanded step which will fail to truly address the underlying problem.",

And not because I think the administration is evil, but because SH has repeatedly showed (in prior incidents too) that they're completely incapable of taking anything like this seriously. Throughout this entire process, I never heard *anybody*, *anywhere* say *anything* to the tune of, \"ah crap, let's play along and try to lay low until this blows over.\" Because that's what you have to do. Ultimately, students don't have any rights in this kind of situation and are totally at the mercy of the administration.\n\nInstead, we got loads of whining, conspiracy theories, deliberate attempts to reframe this as an attack on the LGBT community/minorities/etc., mock accounts galore, and widespread flat-out denial that there was anything wrong in SH. I can completely believe that the administration received mostly immature hate mail as a response.",

Open and free discussion and collaboration are the only way that the administration can regain the trust of the students, alumni, and staff.\n\nIf the administration had any sense, the real Barnhart would be here, on FB, and in The Tech's comments section, hosting open community meetings, and otherwise actually talking with the students she claims to be protecting from the \"toxic culture\" of Senior Haus",

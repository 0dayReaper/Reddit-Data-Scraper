I'm currently working as a part-time janitor at MIT, solving graduate math problems at night, and working in construction. Unfortunately, I have a criminal record with violent offenses but I'm currently seeing a counselor help me integrate into society.  Now to all you MIT alumni out there, I have only one question for you guys. How do you like them apples?",

You're gonna be convinced of that 'til next month when you get to James Lemon, and then you're gonna be talkin' about how the economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania were entrepreneurial and capitalist way back in 1740. That's gonna last until next year -- you're gonna be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood, talkin' about, you know, the Pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019m a chemical engineering student studying at the University of Minnesota. I\u2019m planning on visiting MIT campus this summer. I searched online and found that the great campus has stores like COOP. I really want to buy some MIT binders if they are offered.\n\nI\u2019m a person who is neat and uses a lot of binders and engineering paper for studying classes (shown below) I got three binders for each ChemE course, one for lectures slides, homework/recitation problems and keys. \n\nChecking MIT open courseware I found information about courses that are similar to what I\u2019m gonna take in the fall including the textbook suggested and recitation problems and homework. I plan to study using those resources also.\n\nI\u2019m so excited about my visit!! I want to study in libraries MIT for a day or even longer.",

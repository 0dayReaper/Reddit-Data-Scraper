    "postText": "Hello, I'm looking for a bit more information on what the day to day life of someone who is looking for an Undergraduate degree within MIT's Computation and Cognition Major.\n\nI have become really interested in this subject, and would like to learn more about how all of it operates. If someone could let me in on homework load, general demand, their favorite and least favorite parts about it, how people on campus view people within this major, etc., I would be more than grateful.\n\nThat being said, I understand that this course is a bit niche within colleges right now, so if someone also has information on schools that are working within the same field or resources for personal study on the subject, I would love to hear about that as well. \n\nThank you!",

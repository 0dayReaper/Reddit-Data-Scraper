            "comment": "If you chose Next or New Vassar, yes. If you chose Simmons or EC, no.\n\nDorms definitely fall into \"demand surplus\" and \"supply surplus\" dorms. IDK if the housing application is already done for pre-frosh, but if you want to **maliciously** game the system, I'd suggest you select for \"demand surplus\" dorms because when FYRE rolls around, many people are going to try to get into their preferred dorm, and you only get switched in FYRE if someone actually wants your spot.\n\nNow, if you like Next, don't just arbitrarily deprive someone who likes Simmons a spot, but, you know, I'm not on campus anymore so if you want to selfishly cause chaos in your favor, this is a good way to do it!\n\nEDIT: dorm info inaccurate, also this is just a fun thought, I obviously don't condone doing this unless you want to start on your supervillain arc",

EC is closed for the incoming freshmen, and New Vassar is highly competitive for being a new dining dorm next to the Z. Checking [recent FYRE stats](https://thetech.com/photos/9867) will give a better idea; generally people want to move into dorms that were recently renovated and have shiny facilities (BC, New, New Vassar).",

I added NV b/c I thought as a large frosh dorm it'd be like Next\n\nThe FYRE stats are interesting, **but these are successful FYRE transfers**. There's many many more applications that are submitted, so using that I don't think is useful.",

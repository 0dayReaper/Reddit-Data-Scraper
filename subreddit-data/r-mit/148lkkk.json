    "postText": "I saw a lot of course by MIT provided which are free. Since MIT wants to give access to there lectures, assignments, problem set, etc. I was wondering if it helps getting some extra points based on some finished of them if you want to apply for MIT undergraduate/graduate program? Also does it have to be with certificate from somewhere like Edx or it can be just from MIT courseware?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance.",

They have rigorous (MIT-level) psets + proctored exams, and usually require 18+ months of dedicated study to complete them.  Plus you'll have to take a final comprehensive exam covering all the materials from all the courses in a series.\n\nAlso, if one does well throughout the online MicroMasters, that only gives a \"right to apply\" to the respective MIT graduate program.  You still have to compete against all the other highly qualified candidates to actually get accepted to MIT.",

            "comment": "OCW is not a system that has any concept of \"completing\" a course or a method of granting a certificate. (That's MIT xPro, which is an actual course-taking system.) There aren't necessarily complete copies of all the p-sets and exams either. You could \"do\" them yourself, but it doesn't have a system to take that sort of input. I don't think you can get \"points\" per say, except that you possibly could arrange to take a class as a self-study and get a high school teacher to supervise you taking a copy of an exam or doing a final project. Depending on how supportive your high school might be, you could even ask a teacher or classmate to generate a numerically-different final exam for you. Don't worry about having the lack of a formal mechanism stop you from doing something you're interested in. I think it still comes across as you taking the effort to study something interesting to you. I would certainly be interested in hearing that from an applicant as an alumni interviewer. It wouldn't tell me you're qualified to pass a real final exam in the class, but it tends to be clear when a student is chasing something \"for show\" vs \"because they wanted to do it\".",

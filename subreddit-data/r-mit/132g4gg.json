    "postText": "Incoming phd student here. I would ideally like to bring my car to mit, but I\u2019m considering on campus housing and the parking permits are absurdly expensive. Do most grad students who have a car live off campus and get a Cambridge street permit? Or does absolutely no one even bother keeping a car? \n\nIf it matters, I\u2019m from mass and have been living with a car in the Boston outskirts for a few years. Insights (esp. from grad students) would be much appreciated. Thanks!!",

It is insanely expensive but there didn't seem to be a way around it. \n\nI spent three years without a car and was fine. Between the lack of parking spots and the crazy traffic, it was much more efficient to bike everywhere. There was a bus from SidPac to Trader Joe's (but honestly, I never took it).",

            "comment": "I have a car and had it on campus in the Westgate Lot for my first year, when I lived on campus. I hardly ever used it since the first year of grad school is A LOT, and I found driving in Cambridge and Boston really daunting.\n\nI moved off campus after my first year (which was always my plan), and having a car as a resident in Cambridge is really cheap - $25/year for street parking. Most of my driving is to the grocery store or Target - I would say I drive it to the store once or twice a week, maybe more in the winter. Plus now that I have friends throughout the Boston area, it's helpful for days when the weather is crappy and I want to go to a friend's house that's not close to the T. It's been a godsend as I've gotten into hiking in New Hampshire or when my roommate was borrowing it regularly for skiing in Vermont, and I like being able to drive to the beach on a whim. \n\nThat said, you definitely don't need a car, and I prefer biking for the vast majority of my transit. Generally, someone in your friend group will have a car, and you'll all borrow that person's car and/or they'll drive the group to Costco (or whatever). It's really expensive to keep it at MIT, but if/when you move off-campus, it gets more convenient, cheaper, and more useful.",

I wasn't willing to get rid of the car, and I had no family or friends in the area where I could have left it. Honestly, if you can find a place in the outskirts to leave the car your first semester, you could leave it there for cheap/free and see how often you miss having the car. If you end up needing it for a long weekend you can still go grab it, and you're not selling the car before you're sure you don't want it. Just my two cents.",

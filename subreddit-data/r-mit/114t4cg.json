I\u2019ve seen Quora posts about how there is little interest in IB at MIT, but I wondered if I could hear that from a student. If so, do any of you all plan on entering the IB industry? Thank you!",

Make sure you research the field, know what you want to do and plan out your activitive/class work so you can shine in your interviews.",

To be a quant, you generally have to have a master\u2019s or PHD, and I wanted to go into IB just as an analyst to 1) pay off undergrad debt, 2) gain experience for my MBA, and 3) save up to help pay for my MBA. I look forward to learning more about it in college though, bc I\u2019m from a vv rural area where nobody even knows what IB is lol. Thanks again!",

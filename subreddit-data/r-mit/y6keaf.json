He had this posted to his door, and was one of the most caring and generous faculty i have ever worked with while at MIT. \n\nHe cared about students, as he was once one himself, and I found these lessons were always a nice reminder whenever things became too much while I was a student still. \n\nI figured some current students would appreciate reading them.",

Too many grad students worry about their research being \"good enough\" whereas Tom always said to just focus on how far you have come, and what is it you actually need to graduate and finish. Did you answer a question, conduct the experiment(s), and explain coherently the results you got? yep? here's a PhD. You can finish the rest under a postdoc if you want. \n\nHe really helped me get out of my own head when i had grand visions for my doctoral work, and he said \"pick three contributions you think you'll make to the field, and stick to just those and never lose sight of them\". Really helped me reel in what was important, and what was just a time waster. \n\nHe was an academic titan, and head/shoulders above most other profs in terms of dedicating himself to helping students. He will be missed &lt;3",

Then fuck off and drop out. No degree for you.",

He knew we all came from silos, and he taught us how to expand our understanding of other cultures, sexualities and a woman who had been an undergrad in Course 16 who believed Earth was only 6000 years old.  Definitely the most interesting class I had at MIT.",

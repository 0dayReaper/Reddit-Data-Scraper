Have any of you done something similar? Should I just cold email professors and ask if they have any positions available? Are any of you aware of any opportunities at MIT? Thanks!",

You can find these jobs \ntypically on job boards, and labs that have money to hire techs will usually have one or more active techs on their lab website, or listed as alumni.",

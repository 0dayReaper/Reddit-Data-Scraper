            "comment": "MIT actually has one DI sport: rowing! However (and I say this with love as someone who was on the rowing team for 4 years), the MIT rowing teams are not really competitive with top DI programs, and are more comparable to good DIII teams or lower-tier DI teams.\n\nThe basic answer to \"why not DI in other sports?\" is that: MIT sports teams would not be very competitive in DI, for multiple reasons. As other commenters said, MIT doesn't have much interest in admitting students for their athletic prowess, but rather admits strong students who also happen to be athletic. Also, MIT coursework is challenging and time-consuming, and so student-athletes at MIT don't have time or energy to put in the level of training that happens in top DI programs.\n\nI'm most familiar with men's rowing, where some top DI programs basically demand 40 hrs/wk year-round, and recruit top athletes from around the world, some of whom only meet basic academic standards. Neither of these policies would fly at MIT (top recruits routinely get denied admission despite strong academic profiles, and the max time commitment for sports tops out around 20 hrs/wk), and as a result, MIT isn't really competitive with top tier DI rowing programs.\n\nMy understanding is that other sports teams at MIT have similar constraints on recruiting and training, so can be quite successful in DIII but would struggle in DI. And to be clear, there's nothing wrong with that! Doing an MIT sport is a lot of fun, and MIT coaches understand that academics always come before athletics -- IMO it's an approach to college sports that is better and gentler to the athletes than the stereotypical hypercompetitive DI approach that often leads to overtraining injuries and interferes with athletes' academic success.",

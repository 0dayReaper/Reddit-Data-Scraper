Any ideas for a nice little gift (dorm decor or gift certificate)?  \nWe don\u2019t know her so something universal to most MIT students.\nThanks!!!!",

I'm not sure if all of these places offer gift cards but Flour, Beantown Taqueria, and Roxy's are popular takeout-y places nearby. If it's easier to get from a chain, Starbucks, Dunkin, and Chipotle are probably your best bet.",

    "postText": " Hi everyone,\n\nAs part of my New Years resolution I want to become more involved in volunteering around Boston/Cambridge. I was wondering if anybody here has recommendations on either places to volunteer or ways to find volunteering opportunities.\n\nIdeally, I am looking for opportunities that are pretty flexible scheduling-wise and are open over the weekend. Thanks!",

Also, the PKG Center used to have service days where you could sign up to volunteer from a list of causes and events. This was before Covid, so I am unsure if these still happen. Nonetheless, the website https://pkgcenter.mit.edu may have some opportunities listed",

There's actually quite a few opportunities including\n\nFood/homeless kitchens (Haley House Soup Kitchen, St. Francis House, Boston Rescue Mission, etc.)\n\nThe Greater Boston Food Bank (which isn't in a great area) (Saturday is the only weekend day): [https://www.gbfb.org/get-involved/volunteer/](https://www.gbfb.org/get-involved/volunteer/)\n\nHospitals like MGH has a really good volunteer program. I remember meeting with their volunteer coordinator like 15-20 years ago and was quite impressed at how thought out they were: [https://www.massgeneral.org/volunteer](https://www.massgeneral.org/volunteer)\n\n(For instance, they'd give free parking, free snacks, a free meal after a certain amount of volunteering -- all intentional -- to reciprocate back a little out of gratitute. Plus they were able to figure out what you were able to do.)\n\nA lot of churches also have volunteer opportunities. These really range in what they do (a number of them run food kitchens, run homeless ministries, etc.)\n\nMIT used to have a pretty active Habitat for Humanity chapter (building houses for those who need them). A guy in my neighborhood (I didn't know him at all) needed a house -- like he was storing a propane tank under his porch and one night he didn't make sure his grill coals had been put out. He just dumped it on the dry grass thinking they were out. His house burned down but Habitat for Humanity built him a replacement very quickly. I was impressed.\n\nThe PKG Center may have opoportunities.",

I volunteer for their \"Healthy Eats\" program delivering grocery boxes to low-income seniors on the weekend. If you don't have a car or can't commit to a biweekly shift, there are other more flexible volunteer opportunities there as well.",

One option is to look into the myriad student activity organizations, even if they're focused on undergrads -- just about all of the ones I got involved with had significant LGBT involvement.",

They also host lots of fun events during fall and spring rush, which you can attend even if you don\u2019t intend to join. \n\nSpinning Arts, Tech Squares, The Assassins\u2019 Guild, Caving Club, Live Action Mafia Club, and Musical Theater Guild all are pretty queer student groups last time I checked.\n\nThere\u2019s also GaMIT, MIT Aces, and maybe some other specifically queer-focused queer student groups.",

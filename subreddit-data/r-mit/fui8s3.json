    "postText": "MIT Alert is for emergencies to notify you of things like fire alarms, suspicious packages, and chemical spills. This is important to get people fast information of places to stay away from, and to be alerted of imminent danger.\n\nIt seems like these daily nominal status updates aren't in keeping with that spirit. Today's contained information about the career fair for crying out loud. That is not critical information and therefore feels like an abuse of the purpose of MIT Alert.\n\nMIT Alert would have been fine for the big events that have happened, like canceling all classes, kicking out all undergrads, and the first few cases being tested on campus. But daily tweaks in policies and such should really just be an email.\n\nEdit: I just complained about this to a friend and they said \"I don't even read those anymore tbh\" which is EXACTLY the problem here.",

I was around in 2013 where we got multiple  active shooter texts, several bomb warnings and two sets of shelter in place orders. One set of those was very very real and very very scary. It took a very short time after that for the MIT alert system to be overused. The bomb squad got called in for backpacks pretty much every other day for a while.",

This may not be the case for others on campus and in the community. The messages are going to 13K faculty and staff, and 15K students. Some of them need the advisories.",

Additionally an organization comprised of 26000 individuals, during a time of crisis, requires a leadership that communicates what they can, while they can.\n\nTLDR: Seems pretty dumb to complain about communication, transparency, and advisory information, during a pretty unique situation.

Although indeed a few people are left on campus, most of the people getting these alerts are not affected by them, meaning that people are more likely to ignore them, even when there is important information.\n\nThe leadership can communicate through email plenty, and email is a format where people are expected to check it repeatedly at their convenience, rather than dropping everything for it.",

    "postText": "Just wanted to share a cool statistic:\n\nStarting this week, MIT's been conducting COVID tests at the rate of around 2,000 tests per day. That number didn't really mean much to me until I realized that the entire state of Massachusetts is currently conducting around 20,000 tests per day. Therefore, **MIT's testing now single-handedly accounts for nearly 10% of all daily tests in Massachusetts.**\n\nAlthough the testing rollout hasn't been perfect, Medical is absolutely crushing it with the volume of testing that they're doing.\n\n[MIT statistics](https://medical.mit.edu/CovidTestingResults)\n\n[MA statistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusMa/comments/idhxm4/ma_covid19_data_82020/)",

Someone asked about the ethics of using thousands of tests on young healthy students instead of people who really need them, and the MIT folks replied that there's no reason to spend the $$$$$ to get it FDA approved, meaning the tests can't be used to make a diagnosis and won't be included in the state testing numbers, but MIT is allowed to use the tests for its own internal operations (which is what they are doing). Presumably if you tested positive at MIT they'd send you to a \"real\" state test. Although I personally trust MIT's tests more :)",

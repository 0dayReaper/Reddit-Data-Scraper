    "postText": "Hello everyone.\n\nI will be moving into Burton-Connor on June 4th as a MSRP-Bio intern. I am wondering if any students that are moving out have a portable AC unit available to rent/buy for the 10 weeks I will be at MIT. If not, does anyone have other resources that will help me find a cheap but working portable AC unit? Thanks so much.\n\nEdit: Only portable AC units are permitted. I cannot use a window AC unit, unfortunately :(",

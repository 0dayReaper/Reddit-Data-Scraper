We can\u2019t tell you what you know and what you don\u2019t know. Also, I personally never did a tour of MIT, so there were no questions that I asked.",

In my experience at least, there's been tons of times where I know I'd appreciate more information but I have no real idea on what specific information I'd like. Also, in the moment it's easy to completely blank on questions to ask so coming prepared is useful.",

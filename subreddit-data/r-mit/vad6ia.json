    "postText": "I'm a PhD student. I wrote and directed my own plays in undergrad. I was wondering if anyone would be interested in acting in or helping stage a play this upcoming year? We could basically be part of a production in one of the theater groups on campus. These groups have mostly undergrads in them but they are always looking for graduate students to join! Comment if you're interested :)",

Do you know if there are opportunities for film or tv? Like ways to get involved or learn more about pilot writing or cinematography? I couldn\u2019t find anything like this online.",

I mostly did musical theater guild shows, but all groups are very grad student friendly. Not sure about the pilot writing/cinematography stuff, but I'd encourage you to reach out to the theater department",

            "comment": "I always thought MTG was awesome, though their focus is musicals. I know they accept grad students and I think they particularly have several grad students in the orchestra section, but I know they have some in other roles like acting or producing too\n\nThere\u2019s also the Shakespeare ensemble. They usually do Shakespeare plays that are pretty good, but my favorite thing of theirs was always the 24 hour shows, where they start writing a show at 7pm one day and put it on at 7pm the next day. The ones I saw generally were based on Shakespearean plays but with pop culture and other topics mixed in/done as a comedy overall. I remember one that premiered during my freshman orientation was Hamleton and it was amazing. I\u2019m pretty sure they accept grad students as well, but I\u2019d definitely recommend going to see them if nothing else. They\u2019re usually during REX at the beginning of the year, as well as at the end of IAP",

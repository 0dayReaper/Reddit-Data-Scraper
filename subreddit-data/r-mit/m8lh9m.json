I understand what you are saying but you should not be discouraged just because your peers would be gold medalists and what-not. MIT does not admit students without a reason. They must have seen you as a great fit for the MIT community. That is why, they offered you admission.\n\nMIT is a diverse place. Everyone has their own backstory. It is a challenging place but I am sure that it would help you out in your future endeavours.\n\nPs: You can look up KJ Hardict (AE \u201820) on YouTube. He has many videos about MIT and the life there. I hope it helps.",

I labored over them for months and they still kinda sucked.\n\n&gt; no math competitions/olympiads/research/etc\n\nI never did any of that either. MIT people (students, profs, admissions, etc.) see this as academic wankery. We think it's fun to do the Putnam or whatever, but nobody thinks you're not good at math if you suck at it. We recognize that doing well on these kinds of things is as much about knowing the strategies (and having the opportunities to study them) as being \"smart\".\n\n&gt; my programming experience is very limited (functionally non existent)\n\nThis is fine. Very few incoming Course 6 majors have any significant programming. Many have done some programming, whether in APCS or their own dicking around, but that barely counts for anything.

It wrecked my self-confidence, to say the least. I considered myself rather diligent since the beginning of highschool, and sunk a lot of time into music production and now guitar, which I hope to take further, but seeing the folks with achievements upon achievements in international/national stem-related competitions and research and all sorts of crap that I can't imagine adolescent students give a rat's arse about pursuing really was demoralizing. But I kind of had this bitter belief that surely ao's wouldn't find applicants pursuing arbitrary competitions that highschool students surely wouldn't do for interest's sake attractive? I know it's a toxic mindset to hold, but I can imagine it would get obnoxious when you see thousands of applicants doing similar things quite advertently to get into your uni.  \nAnyways, not to say that I have any better of a chance, but gives some relief.",

Since you don't find school challenging, you're going to have to find other things that are. Learn a language, a musical instrument, a sport - something that doesn't come naturally or easily to you, but that interests you. Aim for a reasonable degree of proficiency, and fight for it if you have to. Don't let anyone tell you it's unnecessary or a waste of time.\n\nI mean, let's assume you get into MIT after coasting all the way through high school. (Trust that if you get admitted, it's because MIT thinks you can succeed here.) You'll learn how to study because you're forced to, but that'll just make your first year that much more stressful. As it stands now, you have a couple of years yet to learn that stuff before you get here, so you might as well start now.\n\nAnd even if you don't go to MIT, learning how to apply yourself in the face of challenges is a life skill that will serve you well no matter where you end up.",

We usually say this at CPW as a joke, but most admitted students submit their apps on the day they are due; most admitted students did not participate in (inter)national STEM competitions or high-level research; most admitted students didn't have much programming experience in high school. \n\nAnd some of the things that you are worried make you weak \u2014  like your study skills \u2014  are in fact more likely to make you a strong MIT student: our research shows that students who come in with strong noncognitive skills, like good study habits, often have a better transition than students who coasted through high school on (air quotes incoming) \"\"\"natural intelligence\"\"\" and then hit a wall at MIT. \n\nFurthermore, we would not have admitted you \u2014  for whatever reason \u2014  unless we were _extremely_ confident in your academic preparation. Given all the disruptions this year, we applied really intense scrutiny on every student to make sure we were as confident as anyone can be in their preparation. \n\nYou are experiencing a very normal response, the one that most admits ~who are not arrogant/overconfident~ experience. Let me sketch what your future might be, just because it is a very common pattern I have seen over and over, in terms of the roller coaster: \n\n* shock upon admission  \n* initial grip of terror (they must have made a mistake; I'm not actually that good) \n* self-efficacy slowly rises throughout spring and summer as reality of admission sets in and people gas you up as the MIT genius \n* arrive at MIT, it's insanely hard, self-efficacy plummets back to \"oh god they really _did_ make a mistake\" \n* slowly realize that everyone around you is being challenged, and some things you find hard others find easy, and some things you find easy others find hard \n* your identity will begin to shift from \"person who is smart and good at school\" to \"person who works hard to solve problems the best i am able\" \n* self-efficacy slowly recovers, maybe never to its post-pi day height, but, by graduation, to a higher degree (and crucially more robust/resilient/well-founded quality) than it was for most of high school or college experience \n\nThis will not _necessarily_ be your future, it's different for everyone. But if you experience any part of this path, I hope you find comfort in knowing that this is part of what makes the MIT education so challenging, and so rewarding, and the latter because of the former. Hope to see you around in the fall.",

MIT kicks everyone in the ass eventually if you're doing it right; it's just a matter of when. in some ways getting that reality check early on helps you handle things with more grace throughout undergrad. if you're coming in with humility you'll be well placed to do well. \n\n\nit sucks to feel like you're carrying the weight of a demographic on your shoulders if you're in a place or field where your demographic is underrepresented. I'm a queer woman working in a heavily male field, and it's a feeling that's hard to shake. to be clear, you should not have to feel like you're representing all black people - our society sucks - but that doesn't mean that feeling isn't or won't be there. \n\n\nI've found it helpful to find pockets of people like me to validate how I'm feeling, on good days and bad (\"did X person really just say that? am I right to feel mad?\" \"I deserve this recognition, right?\" \"Y policy change doesn't feel great to me\"), and just to have a space where I don't feel out of place. I know that at MIT, for example, the BSU (Black Student Union) has been very active in pushing for change at the Institute and seems to be a great community. MIT still has a long way to go with diversity, inclusion, and equity, but I've noticed more conversations happening about it in recent years. \n\n\nplease reach out if I can be of any help at all.

I worked part time at a restaurant through high school too. My parents also never finished high school so I didn't know anything about college. Nothing \"qualifies\" me to go to one of the best schools in the world, but here I am anyways. \n\nI'll admit that being tossed headfirst into doing physics with calculus(8.01) when you've barely done physics before, or doing what used to be a week's worth of math content at my high school in an hour(18.01) will take a bit to get used to.\nI also never took a programming or cs class before, but ended up enjoying 6.0001/2(Intro to CS). If you're open to learning, MIT will help you. I'll admit that I've cried from frustration before because I felt behind, like it wasn't clicking while it seemed like everyone else was moving faster than me or started ahead, but I found help in classmates, TAs, and instructors who wanted to me to enjoy the subjects that they are so passionate about and learned how to keep up and exceed what I thought I was capable of.\n\nThis feeling of not measuring up, of constantly being behind your peers is one that many people share, but you're not here to focus on their education, just yours. There will always be someone better than you at something, so all you can do is put your best foot forward and try your best in what you wanna do. I thought I'd regret going to MIT when I could've gone elsewhere and probably put in half the effort to get far more credit for my work, but I don't.",

Never won a competition, no notable internship. Also know what it's like to wonder the role affirmative action played in admission. Black and gay so perfect ticket to meet their diversity quota.\nFact is regardless of where we go, we'll always feel like the ambassador for blackness. I'd like to think that MIT is full of brilliant people who understand that we aren't representatives for millions of people.\nLike you, I felt under prepared. But there is no better place to be underprepared than MIT. Of course, this is all empirical. But in all my years of academia, I've never encountered faculty and admin so ready and willing to assist you. Also, being underprepared doesn't attest to your intelligence/capability. Neither does the amount of time you took to study in high school. For example, I never understood physics until I started studying in openlibraries (if you want to prepare, the MIT openlibrary, ocw and edx are great places to start). Maybe your teachers didn't do the best job explaining, or maybe you haven't really learned how to study effectively as yet.\nStill, demonstrated intelligence isn't necessarily the biggest indicator in your ability to succeed at MIT. It's resilience and humility. Being able to fail and not quit, being able to put in the hours, and more importantly being able to admit you don't understand something and need help. It's not about the ECs you lack, maybe they saw that resilience and potential in you.\n\nMIT isn't easy. And I've felt panic and dismay several times being here. I've cried countless times. But there's no where else I'd rather be. And as underprepared as I was, with all the help I've asked for and been given, I'm doing pretty damn well. It's hell but it's also paradise. Ihtfp.",

Course 6 is a school-within-the-school with a lot of course-specific resources. Be very proactive and ask your advisor for help. Don't ever pretend you're fine if you're not.\n2. Don't be a hero. I enrolled in 8.022 and 18.022 my first semester, and it took me a while to dig out of that hole. I didn't have the study skills I needed, so intelligence didn't matter.\n3. Time Management. Time Management. Time Management. Time Management. Start with the easiest feasible class schedule. Learn how a problem set is different from high school homework. Treat it like a job and go to every single lecture and recitation.\n4. Don't stress about affirmative action. You didn't get in by accident. The reason you're in is because the admissions committee understands that perfectly optimizing a white, suburban gifted school isn't the only sign that you can be successful. Working fast food on a strict shift schedule is a HUGE advantage over other kids, see previous point.\n5. Seriously though, for most of us MIT is about time management, not intelligence. You're smart enough to learn what you need to, don't stress about other kids coming in with more academic creds. 99% of undergrads will hit a point where their existing knowledge isn't sufficient, and things move too fast to keep up on pure intellect. The earlier that happens, the better. It's a huge struggle to learn how to learn once things are already going.\n6. School takes up enough mental and emotional energy. If majority white spaces are exhausting for you, check out social/living groups that match your background so you have a safe space to recharge.\n\nEDIT:\n\n7. Course 6 is terrible for actually teaching languages, they assume you know the languages and teach the theory behind them. Look at intro class in other courses (e.g. I took 1.00 to learn Java, so I could complete my course 6 coursework).\n\n8. There is a surprising strong social scene. Schedule your study time strictly so that partying on a friday or saturday night doesn't screw you over for the next week. Boston is a super fun town with half a million other college students. You'll want to take advantage of that.",

            "comment": "I was admitted from a rural GA public school and I felt extremely similarly when I got in. I was afraid I'd be the dumbest one there. I distinctly remember crying during CPW because I was so overwhelmed with the thought of going to school with people so different in a place so different where I could very easily fail, but I'd gotten a full need scholarship so it was actually cheaper than GA Tech, and who turns down MIT? Visiting (which they paid for because I applied through a fee waiver) was my first time on a plane. I was one of only a few with a southern accent. I have the privlege of being white but I also couldn't help but think my admission was a low income/rural diversity admit. And to be fair, my life experiences were very very different than most of my peers at MIT. But god damn what an opportunity MIT was for me. As I look back now 10 years+ from graduating I can very well say that MIT's admissions offer to me was akin to climbing 20+ rungs on the privlege ladder. I still find myself in rooms and conversations where 95% of people came from much much more privileged backgrounds than I did and that I am able to contribute a different perspective to solutions/ideas than them which is the whole point of affirmative action -to get capable people with less privlege into positions where they can make a difference.\n\nAll that said, I came here to say that MIT does it's damn best to level the playing field for you and all the Private school California kids by the end of your freshman year. They do this by offering all the GIRs at different \"levels\". So the kids whose schools had every AP class and they got 5s can either skip out or take the \"hard\" version while you can take a physics class that lasts longer than a normal semester 8.01L (which is what I took because I didn't know what a vector was when I got there). They offered Pass No Record, ABC, no record and I'm not ashamed to say I No Recorded a class frosh spring &amp; took it again and did fine. I took a few classes in Concourse because they were easier/ the community was built in. I was a regular at office hours.  There are lots of creative ways to find what you need to be successful and they mostly fall in your lap. Idk if I ever felt \"smart\" compared to the kids who won Intel Science (legit had never heard of it before I got to campus), but I do know that I was always able to get the help I needed to succeed when I asked/looked for it. By the end of my freshman year, I'd gotten all B's and I was elated to be just an average kid at MIT, and didn't feel like my educational background was causing me any big hurdles going forward from there.\n\nMIT's biggest pro is that it's a small school and it's got one hell of a supportive community. I think even the California private school kids struggle with their classes and feel inadequate sometimes. Basically no one can do MIT alone, so we've built a community to get through it together. You won't be working alone when you're at MIT. You'll be in a pset group getting work done. Most hard classes in every major are group project based. \n\nGood luck with your decision. But know that if you do end up at MIT you'll find community to help you through. I think a lot more people could make it through MIT than they let in, but they didn't make a mistake.",

I think you need to read this in full.\n\n&gt;I had never heard of MIT. And it hadn\u2019t crossed my mind to study abroad. I was already enrolled in the local university. But my classmate told me MIT had awesome financial aid and said the math there was really good. I wanted to learn more math, so I decided to play along and  apply.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At that moment I was failing most of my classes in high school. It was not clear that I was going to graduate. I had a little bit of an attitude problem. I was very interested in a lot of things but I did not  like being told, \u201cRead this\u201d or \u201cThink this way.\u201d I just kind of wanted  to do things on my own terms.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I was failing, I think, six out of eight subjects. Had I known what  MIT was, I should have known not to apply. There is no way I should have  applied with that kind of transcript.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I like telling this story to my students because I think we often close doors to ourselves by thinking that we\u2019re not eligible or that we\u2019re not good enough. And especially if you\u2019re somebody who feels  \u201cothered\u201d in your discipline or who feels like you\u2019re lacking confidence, it\u2019s easy to close doors on yourself. There\u2019s a lot of  people in life who are ready to close doors for you, so you can\u2019t do it  for yourself.",

So if you are scared about the physics classes look at some of the classes online before you start, enough so you dont start from 0, the same with programming classes. MIT is famous for not teaching programming but teaching computer science (and you learn programming on your own), so got try to learn some python and you will feel a bit less scared once you are at MIT.

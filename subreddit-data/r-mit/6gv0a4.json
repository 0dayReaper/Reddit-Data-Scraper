    "postText": "Full letter going around the sh mailing list:\n\n-------------------------------\n\nFrom: Cynthia Barnhart &lt;chancellor-reply@mit.edu&gt;\nSubject: Sharing the decision on Senior House\nDate: June 12, 2017 at 3:05:32 PM EDT\nTo: &lt;@mit.edu&gt;\n\nDear ...,\n \nI write on behalf of MIT's senior leadership to inform you of our decision and our plans to support you.\n \nThe turnaround we launched last June engaged you and a number of faculty, staff, and alumni in work to promote personal wellbeing and academic success in your community. As you know, we received credible and concerning information this past semester and launched a review. A few weeks ago, we informed you of our findings that serious and unsafe behaviors and activities occurred in the house during the turnaround. Unfortunately, these behaviors and activities have served to fundamentally undermine our shared goals for the safety, health, and academic success of all Senior House residents.\n \nThe senior officers and I have met with many of you to discuss this matter, and we have received and read many emails on this topic. Before making our decision, we carefully listened to and reflected on what we heard. I hope that, through this dialogue, you gained an appreciation for the position we are in given our responsibility to provide all students with safe and healthy residential communities.\n \n\n**Decision &amp; Support**\n \nWe believe that significant change is needed and have made our decision based on our concern and care for present and future residents of the house. The details of our decision are:\n\nAll residents who wish to live in Senior House during the 2017-18 academic year must complete an application to be a member of the community. You will see that we are seeking individuals who are committed to contributing to a residential environment that supports residents' academic and personal development.\n\nBecause the process will be very selective, many of you will want or need to make alternative housing arrangements for next year. Please know that we are committed to identifying supportive and welcoming options for every member of your community who wishes to live on campus. You can learn more about the relocation process and indicate your housing preferences here. (Also note that, even if you complete a Senior House application, you still need to fill out the housing preferences form so that you can secure a holding assignment while your application is reviewed).\n\nWe will work to find you room assignments in other residence halls as either individuals or as part of small groups of friends. Dean of Student Life Suzy Nelson has established a relocation team led by Dean David Randall and Associate Director Jen Hapgood-White to provide guidance and support for you throughout this process. If you have questions about another residential community, moving off-campus, dining, financial aid, work study or any other topic associated with moving, they can help starting today. To reach this team, please email residential-support@mit.edu.\n\n\n**Moving Forward**\n \nIn addition to students whose applications are approved and the New House students already scheduled to move in while their building undergoes renovations, a cohort of first-year students will reside in the house next year. We are currently developing a program for first-years focused on the personal wellbeing and academic success principles and goals of the turnaround. The program will feature strong faculty and staff engagement as well as opportunities for peer mentorship.\n \nWhile some of you will be disappointed with our decision, I hope you will understand it is firmly rooted in our care for you as students and our concerns about the health and wellness of your residential environment. The senior officers and I are obligated to protect our students' wellbeing and to require accountability when the facts of a serious situation warrant it.\n \nWe have also worked to respect your privacy and to keep this matter as confidential as we can. We appreciate that you have done the same, and that you have engaged with us throughout the entirety of this process. With a decision now made, we would like to continue to keep what prompted the review and the review's findings private.\n \nPlease remember that Dean Randall and Associate Director Hapgood-White are ready to help you right now and can be reached at residential-support@mit.edu. Dean Nelson and I are also here for you if you want to talk about the future at any point over the summer.\n \nSincerely,\n \nCynthia Barnhart\nChancellor\n -------------\n\nDetails on the \"Pilot 2021\" program can be found [here](https://studentlife.mit.edu/housing/undergraduate-housing/residence-halls/pilot-2021-senior-house).",

On the west side I feel like nearly everyone there was from the same background: nuclear family, upper middle class, nice house in the suburbs, learned to drive when they were 16, etc. (Or there were the cultural houses - catering toward minorities, but again, catering to people who fit one of a few particular molds, which I didn't.)\n\nThe \"east side\" seemed to have more kids who: came from low income backgrounds, came from single parent or divorced parent households, were international, were maybe starting college a little older. In the end I felt closer with these people because the east side was our \"family of choice\". Ten years later these are most of the folks I still keep in touch with.\n\nSure, there was some drug use (though I stayed clean - had to for athletics) and some poor decisions, but those were the most interesting people I've ever met.\n\nThis is all anecdotal; please - especially if you work for admissions - validate this with real data. (And, if you find that I'm wrong, tell me!)\n\nThis is MIT for crying out loud, not a state college. Even if they're 17 years old when they show up for Orientation, these freshmen need to think and act like adults.",

The bar has been raised and the void in culture the administration has created will be filled; be a doll and tell your MIT prefrosh friends who turned down Caltech to infiltrate Pilot 2021 before they fill it with the Harvard rejects.\n\nOverall not surprised at administration, brute force is the last resort of the incompetent.",

Many grad students live far off campus (and not in the way a frat or living group would), and I would add, many try to distance themselves from the quintessential MIT culture. Not only are a large group very done with undergrads in general, but you usually don't think, \"Will this kid fit in with our culture?\" during grad school admissions. Then you end up with a lot of grad students who are focused on their PhDs/masters and find the weirdness of MIT to be overhyped, ridiculous, and just a bunch of teenagers trying to be weird or making terrible decisions to stick out. This especially happens with grad students from more...holistic schools, who don't really believe that EC values are important, logical, or even genuine.  Another lot are hugely apathetic. ",

I'm glad to see that you're involved in trying to talk to and about students; I've been hearing from my MIT friends about how you get involved in their class pages and such. Sadly, I ended up not going for a variety of reasons, but really appreciate that you are active on social media and care a lot about attracting genuinely gifted kids into MIT. \n\nYou are most likely right about co2020 vs co2000--My feelings and opinions towards recent attendees probably has a lot to do with the fact that I interact more with co2018s/etc than co 1998s. MIT tries very hard to push this image of earnest and passionate kids who just do their thing (no matter how weird it is) and end up with cool builds and inventions etc etc. I sure know they did when I came to visit during college visits, and I fell for it hard. However, my experiences during my CPW a few years ago were that a huge chunk of the kids I met were not like that. They were very image based and great at seeming passionate, and to an admissions officer who only reads a thousand words about them and only sees an hour of their behavior, yeah, they're \"great fits\", while in truth, they were overwhelmingly focused on prestige and presenting themselves as \"nerdy\" and \"friendly\" when in fact they were very holistic and really really wanted to be praised and recognized. So yeah, maybe in 2000 (or whatever) you also had these duds, but no one really talked about them, and I sure wasn't expecting to meet so many kids that would have fit in at Harvard (and I don't mean this in a good way). In retrospect, I should have listened a lot more to those people on collegeconfidential who were talking about how MIT was basically a macrocosm of competitive and actually decent magnet STEM schools in how toxic, lowkey competitive, and image based it was. \n\nDoesn't help that out of the people I personally know who got into MIT, at least a few were pretty terrible people behind their lovely writing skills and bubbly, charismatic interviews. Quite a bunch were proud of their family faking their finances and would brag about how they helped their dad falsify his taxes or business and how they were only paying $2000 a year, which was a huge hit in the face to people like me whose families would have to lug out the downpayment of a few houses because everything we earned was carefully documented (because government work). Others cheated to get their Olympiad scores and research projects, and most doctored their schedules so they'd avoid difficult AP/IB/advanced classes while still boosting their GPA and resumes by taking redundant, easier, other AP/IB/advanced classes. They were smart enough that they could stay afloat here if they didn't over commit themselves, but those things they deceitfully played up (eg: hardships, STEM accomplishments) in their application were undoubtedly reasons they got in. I can't gauge the depth of their love for science or anything, but I suppose it was enough for them to talk about, though it was of the \"I want to solve *insert problem* using *insert field of science*\" sort with undertones of \"I want to change the world to feel important\". Also unrelated to the above, but I felt and heard enough \"You only got in because you're a girl\"/\"MIT should accept less girls, and accept based on applicant pool percentages\" vibes/conversations, despite many girls being highly gifted, to make me feel uncomfortable spending multiple years in close proximity to these people. \n\nI'm sure admissions isn't sitting down and going \"Hey, we need a few more fake people to round off our class,\" but it most definitely happens a lot. Maybe this type of kid has always been a part of MIT, and it was just something I didn't expect because of how MIT is always publicized as, and I feel it most strongly with current students because I interact most with current students. Maybe it's correlated with the rising existentialism in kids, or how STEM is getting more mainstream (similarly, how being a \"nerd\" is no longer a bad thing if you are charismatic or conform to the societal vision of a nerd a la Big Bang Theory or whatever), thereby attracting more people of all sorts. I'm sure that no matter my opinions on this matter--I ended up going to a state school because financial aid was not enough to make it feasible, because my current school is very excellent in my major (although definitely more short-changed on opportunities) and I can graduate early, and because after CPW, that which had compelled me to apply and entertain coming despite the much higher costs had proven to be not enough--people will continue to apply to MIT and regard it highly due to its reputation, selectivity, and alumni contributions and accomplishments.

People often think they get in because of their essays / ECAs  (which they may know are inflated, as we probably do too) but it is frequently the opposite. It's just that those factors are salient to them so they make a fundamental attribution error. I mean, I hope (and think) we don't admit frauds, but we approach each case with a healthy amount of skepticism and knowledge that people are 'putting their best foot forward' and correct for that. \n\nAlso, and this is not the point you made but sort of a side rant when people say MIT used to be more h4rdc0re: I guess I'm just not sure it was better in the sepia-tinted days of yore when MIT was almost entirely (white) men who liked tinkering and watched porn on reg day in 26-100. Like that was a specific historical version of MIT that was less 'image-based' but also sucked. There are cultural problems in any given class. Attending to specific problems -- meaning, in this case, divergence from large-scale institutional philosophy and strategy -- is the key. \n\ntl;dr: I really don't think we're trying to (or in the main actually doing) recruiting/enrolling fake, image-based students drawn by the prestige of MIT. The data backs this up pretty strongly actually when you compare to our Ivy+ peers. I'm pushing back against the narrative *not* because I'm dismissive of the substantive concerns (with which I agree wholeheartedly), but because I want to redirect the attention to other, more fundamental forces. \n",

Everyone I've met, online and at CPW, even those that don't look or act like typical \"nerds\" really care about their impact over their image. Some do want to be entrepeneurs; some want to be mathematicians; some don't care so long as no one interrupts their coding. They all really love to do something, or several somethings, and want to use those talents to help the world - the outcry from current prefrosh over the SH depopulation, even among those who had no interest in staying there, speaks to that. I do see economic fears, and a recognition of the necessity of having a job even at the cost of personal expression or your ideal life plan. But I'd argue that's a generational trait - to excel and protect their future, students have had to learn to \"play the game\". But these same people were also excited to build, to argue, to explore what MIT has to offer, from entreprenurial networks to \"unauthorized campus art\". I can't speak to those you said forged their credentials, but if my first few months in MIT culture have taught me anything, it's that anyone, from a Miami blonde to a genderqueer punk, can be an absolute nerd who I'd love to have as a classmate",

However, I would say that there is definitely a growing perception among current students and very recent alumni that the population of students is changing in overall culture and aims from being creators to being entrepreneurs, and that the actions of administration is not helping.\n \nDefinitely not as bad as the Harvard students we\u2019ve interacted with, but upperclassmen seem to perceive with every incoming class more and more of the \u201cI\u2019m going to become a consultant/work for Goldman Sachs/make a billion dollar startup and be a millionaire before I\u2019m 25!\u201d attitude and less of a \u201cI\u2019m going to make this cool thing for the sake of making this cool thing\u201d attitude. Hence the spike in course 6 (because software startups are easiest) and drop in the sciences (because it takes way too much time and effort to earn a PhD), as well as a (maybe perceived to be worse than it actually is) difficulty in recruiting new members to groups that do not demonstrate explicit networking advantages. I have been in several different rooms with completely different occupants where a conversation about this culture shift occurred, and every time the upperclassmen sigh in relief and say \u201coh thank goodness it\u2019s not just me\u201d when realizing that others also have similar perceptions.\n \nIt could be that this tendency to sell out is where the population of nerdy high schoolers is heading in general, or it could be that this is a byproduct of MIT\u2019s push towards entrepreneurship. Inherently, entrepreneurship is not a bad thing, especially if backed by the type of cool technology that MIT is known for producing. But too many incoming students strike me as wanting to be entrepreneurs before coming up with an idea, and then choosing the idea they think would be easiest to implement and raise VC. And I love that there are institutional pushes towards maker culture as well, but it seems that those struggle more than pure entrepreneurship initiatives to recruit passionate students. \n \nI think the shift can also be seen in the admissions blogs. When I was applying to MIT I read through the archives, as far back as I could find. For many students like me, the blogs are an invaluable tool for seeing what MIT is really like, and the blogs made me fall in love with the culture of MIT before I arrived. I love the admissions blogs, and I\u2019ve been reading them for years, and I know several of the bloggers. They are wonderful people and wonderful examples of MIT students, and it is critical to the spirit of the blogs that they are not censored. This may be down to personal biases of the blog posts that I remember, but I\u2019ve gotten the feeling of late that the blogs are very entrepreneurship focused (maybe only because I primarily remember those), and Ben O.\u2019s latest guest post even recommended artistic students not come to MIT. Obviously MIT is not for everyone, and I know the author and that they may have been happier at art school, but many talented artists also thrive at MIT and it saddens me to think that some wonderful artists, potential assets to our community, might be dissuaded from applying as a result of that post. It just feels like with venues for the artists/free thinkers being shut down, artists are being deterred/told they\u2019re not welcome. Entrepreneurs are meanwhile welcomed with open arms (see Launch, for example). This is all my perception and may not be widespread, but if enough potential students share this perception then that could explain a shift in the applicants that MIT receives and therefore the perceived shift in the undergraduate body.\n \nMIT seems to care more and more about its image and potential lawsuits than it does about allowing students to do cool things (see the new regulations for all programs interacting with minors at minors.mit.edu). Part of the magic of MIT is the freedom it grants all students, to find the place they want to live and to run the clubs they want to run. We do things that would be impossible at any other school (at some schools, every club requires a faculty sponsor, which is ridiculously stifling). And for the most part, administration works with us to find a compromise that lets us build the roller coaster or host the cool event for K-12 students safely (shoutout to EHS, SAO, and many dorm teams). But actions like this erode students' trust in administration.\n \nDon\u2019t get me wrong, MIT is still a very special place and is still wonderfully different from other schools, especially elite ones, and I have met so many fantastic people here. But I think the concern that we are losing that which makes us special with every new class of students and administrative rule is absolutely legitimate.",

I do think this is a product of larger (i.e., bigger-than-MIT) cultural forces + career fair. \n\n2) I disagreed w/ Ben's post too, as someone who did my SM in CMS and was an RA in MAS and has mentored lots of artistic bloggers over the years. But part of the blogs is that students say what they think; that's what he thinks. It's up to us (admissions, other bloggers) to mount the countercase, which at least I'm trying to do. \n\n3) I agree w/ you that MIT seems to be getting more risk averse (while still being ridiculously risk tolerant compared to our peers). That's why pushing back in constructive ways -- like Spinning Arts working with EHS to get accreditation -- is so important. \n\n4) I do think - and this is entirely gut feeling - that students applying to MIT are less 'weird' than people in the past. But it's hard for me to say if that's because we're attracting/admitting fewer weird people, or if STEM culture is more accepted in K12 so people who are interested in that don't come out quite so alienated (like they did when I was in high school). This is extremely speculative and I haven't thought it through. I'm not sure it's entirely a bad development if it means that people are just as creative but less hurt. But I don't know how one would begin to measure that. ",

It's a part of the culture -- I constantly struggle to be the guy who wanted to save others / help people as I'm pressured by familial finances and high CS salaries. It's making me less quirky because I wonder what stability my life (and family) might have if I end up \"conforming\".\n\nOf course, I think it's more important to remain myself, but it's a struggle nonetheless.\n\n",

One reason why so many students from MIT 'sell out' is bc we have a lot of people from poor/uneducated families who don't have the intergenerational security to just figure themselves out (like I've done in my 20s). I think it's important to take career choices, and others, in that  context. ",

Many outsiders including myself would characterize their interactions with senior house as aggressively insular bordering on obnoxious.  Need an example? People have been insinuating up and down this thread that the rest of campus is essentially a cis/white/privileged culture void.  \n\nWhen your \"culture\" becomes more of a liability to the institute than an asset, the administration is going to make changes.  Believe it or not, west campus and the FSILGs have had this going on for decades.  They've cleaned house on certain floors of baker, burton connor, macg, and countless fraternities.  But it was probably funny when it happened to them because something something privilege.  They weren't part of the 'real' MIT culture anyway.  ",

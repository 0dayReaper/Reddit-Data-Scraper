    "postText": "Hey everyone I\u2019m a CS major at Harvard interested in taking 6.006 in the spring because I\u2019ve heard Harvard\u2019s equivalent of the class is unnecessarily difficult and super theoretical. I want to take the class to get better at algorithms and data structures particularly for technical interviews and SWE positions. Do you think the class helped you with this and is it worth taking? I won\u2019t receive any credit for it but I\u2019m considering taking it if it\u2019s taught well and actually helps you understand the material well.",

I never planned on studying CS in college but I really want to and it seems like all the DSA classes at harvard are only for people with heavy programming and math experience. Do you feel like the class helped a lot with tech interviews?",

However, the TAs can be amazing.\n\nSome of the psets were quite long and sometimes unnecessarily challenging (more so than the 6.046 psets, at least), but I found the exams straightforward.",

As someone who came in with 0 DSA knowledge, I really learned a lot and it helped my problem solving skills. The psets and exams were very challenging for me, but the pset problems were fun/interesting to think about. 006 definitely helped me work through Leetcode better since I had the fundamentals down, and I found that it was nice being able to see the applications of all the different algorithms/data structures I learned in the class.",

Code examples are a bit difficult to understand though. I am a C++ person so I expected that the examples in Python would be pretty easy to understand, but the code examples are a bit tricky and implicit, so that one should take some time to grab what this example code would do. I felt like this course is more focusing on problem solving skills rather than coding(just like Stanford CS106B).",

    "postText": "Hi. I\u2019m aware that course 8-flex has a focus area requirement, which states that one has to take 3 related subjects, not necessarily in physics, in order to complete this requirement. If one completes an official track of study, such as a minor or double major, it would make sense to think that the subjects in that minor/second major are related. Can any 3 subjects taken in the minor or second major just double count with the focus area requirement?",

            "comment": "with a second major, most likely. i am a doubly major in 8-flex and 24-1 (Philosophy), and i was even allowed to use Philosophy classes (like metaphysics, philosophy of quantum mechanics, etc) as my 8-flex focus area if i wanted. i won't, because i want my focus to be astronomy to make an ~Astrophysics~ degree. with minors, it might be a lot different. i was going to get an astronomy minor before my double major, and they only allow a max of 3 classes to overlap with a major or something (including 8.03 and 18.03, so that already took 2 classes because 8 already requires them, so you see how it could be tricky). it depends on the minor, so you'd need to check the requirements of the minor that interests you. \n\nid be happy to answer more questions or help you contact the right human. just ask! i wish you the best!",

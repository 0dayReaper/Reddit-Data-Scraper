I\u2019m sure I\u2019d have done fine either way, but being on campus for the FPOP period definitely helped me feel more grounded on campus when term started.",

They're usually just a themed opportunity to hang out with other incoming students for a few days.\n\nYou'll get plenty of time to do that the rest of the year, so if you would prefer spending time with your family, you wouldn't be missing much.",

I really enjoyed coming early and hanging around EC and got to help build fort but at the end of the day my FPOP itself wasn\u2019t all that impressive. Imo you should hang with your family. I miss mine a lot and am sad I don\u2019t have as much time with them as I used to in high school",

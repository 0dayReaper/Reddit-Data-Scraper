    "postText": "Hello I'm an incoming MIT PhD student and I'm going to be living off campus and was wondering how people get to campus? I figured that MBTA was an obvious choice but I know that people bike or escooter and I basically wanted to know how feasible that is to use either of those two options. I'm looking to buy one or the other but don't know for sure the best option for Boston/Cambridge area. Any advice is much appreciated.",

            "comment": "Both are viable, as an owner of both - Cambridge is one of the most bike- / scooter-friendly places in the U.S..\n\nIf you're going to pick only one, bike is probably a slightly more practical solution (less sensitive to road quality / weather, more modular if you wanna carry groceries, better visibility at night, etc.). But e-scooters are fun, and keep you from getting too sweaty in summer. If you go for a bike, consider a folding bike if you want the ability to take it on the MBTA even during rush-hour (not saying this is the right choice for everyone, just an option).\n\nLiving car-free in Cambridge/Somerville is super easy, and honestly preferable - you'll be faster than car traffic during commuting hours.",

As an MIT student,  you can get a yearly membership for $45, which is a steal. With that membership you get unlimited 45 minute rides for free for a year. After that it is $2.50 per 30 minutes after.   \n\n\nI basically exclusively bike or use the subway / bus as I don't have a car.   \n\n\nThere's also some shuttles (EZ Ride or MIT Shuttles) - but those have limited routes and the MIT Shuttle is not the most reliable.    \n\n\nWelcome to Cambridge!",

I haven't biked in more than a half decade so I've definitely got to get myself up to speed before getting there. *Sigh* I'm going to miss my car. \n\nCambridge here I come!",

They're more expensive to fix as well.",

            "comment": "Many (most?) grad students live off campus, and many (most?) of those live within a mile or two of campus in Cambridge/Somerville. Those people take the T, walk, or bike to campus. I guess a few escooter, but I don't see those very often. Most people don't have cars around here. Parking is quite expensive and traffic is stupid. Honestly, around 9ish, it can take longer to go the mile from Inman to Kendall via car than by bike and sometimes even than by walking.   \n\nWhere will you be living? Maybe we can give you more concrete suggestions based on that.   \n\nFWIW, after about a decade living here, I finally did get a car, but I use it only for grocery shopping and camping/hiking trips. It would be completely not worth it to use it for commuting.",

But I'm looking in the close squares on the Cambridge side so Kendall, Inman, Porter, Davis, and Central. Might be a little bit of Allston but probably not. And yeah my car is not coming with me. Everyone I talked with said to not bring it and since I've never lived in the area or in the north, I trusted what they said.",

Allston would be the most annoying commute, but I've known people who have done it.  Some people also live in the Union square area, another one to consider.   \n\nGood luck with housing, its beastly around here.  \n\nEdit to add: If you do end up living somewhere that biking is your only good way to get to school, make sure you have a plan for the winter. Its definitely feasible to bike commute all year round, but you need to be more prepared in the winter.",

    "postText": "I am going into my 1st year of CS at the University of Washington I am interested in applying to MIT as a transfer student after 1st year (or after first semester if possible). I am aware that the odds are against me. I am hoping if there are any students who have successfully transferred to MIT from another university that they could share their stories here. If so please include where you transferred from, after how long, what EC's you had, what your grades were like, and any tips that think helped your application or helped you along the way. Thanks! TL;DR Did you transfer to MIT? Please share your story",

Unless you are exceptional, I can\u2019t imagine being a CS student at a major public school makes you stand out.  Don\u2019t really worry about others really.  \n\nJust control what you can and apply.  Get a 4.0, try to be involved, try hard on your AP exams, and try to demonstrate why you would add diversity to the current class.  \n\nEven if you don\u2019t get into MIT, these steps will help you get into other more transfer friendly schools if that\u2019s what you desire.",

It would be much more probably to get in as an exceptional graduate student. This will also allow you to gain work experience to clarify what you want to specialize in for your graduate studies.",

It also comes across as entitled.\nBut to answer: be you authentically, and be honest in your application. That\u2019s all the advice I can give you as a transfer student here. Acceptance is improbable but not impossible.",

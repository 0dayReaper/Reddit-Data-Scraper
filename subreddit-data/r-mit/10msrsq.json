Comments with more context on what you're doing over the summer would be great. I know there are other resources online for what internships in specific fields generally pay, but I wanted to get a sense of what peers are actually making.\n\nI would add more options to the poll but reddit only allows 6 and I wanted to have a results option so the results aren't completely skewed.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/10msrsq)",

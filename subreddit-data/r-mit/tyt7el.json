That case was just due to lack of interest in the work in the first lab. \n\nWhen you approach potential PIs you should definitely ask about funding though.",

            "comment": "This can and does happen, frequently as a mechanism for (abusive) PIs to rid themselves of PhD students they don't like without requiring just cause. All your PI has to do is simply refuse to cover your tuition and there's nothing you can do about it. In some cases, your department might pick up the slack or offer you a teaching position and help transitioning research labs -- but this is far from standardized between departments, and there's never a guarantee there will be funding/TAships available. If there aren't, you have the choice of either paying tens of thousands of dollars a semester while floundering to find another PI to save you -- or simply mastering out. Many choose the latter.\n\n Because MIT charges fellowships [so much tuition that even students on NSF GRFP aren't fully covered](https://sfs.mit.edu/help/faq/i-have-an-nsf-grfp-fellowship-and-it-doesnt-completely-cover-my-tuition-what-do-i-do/) -- for which, it's worth noting, they're [currently under investigation by the NSF Inspector General](https://oig.nsf.gov/reports/other/massachusetts-institute-technologys-noncompliance-certain-graduate-research) -- even students with fellowships that would be totally safe at other institutions can be vulnerable to this. [And this has happened before](https://twitter.com/davidasilva/status/1258434028761382915).",

The alternative is for the PI to explain to their colleagues why they fired a student, which will make it harder for the student to find another advisor. Some PIs are also conflict averse and want to spare the student the real reason (s) why they are being let go, which isn't a great reason but I wouldn't call it abusive. (Of course abusive PIs exist but I think you are painting with a much too broad brush.)",

The NSF issue is concerning and bolstered by your links...thanks.\n\nHowever, regarding the disgruntled twitter user, a single person who is also vocal on twitter is certainly evidence, but leaves a lot of possible explanations, from the student was at fault to the professor was at fault to nobody was at fault.  It would be move believable if the twitter user:\n\n1.  Didn't restrict who could reply to his twitter thread.\n2.  Named the professor (which would be risky if his version of events were untrue and defamatory).\n\nEverybody rationalizes.  I know a guy who mastered out of a Physics Ph.D. at another institution...and he also claims it was because of an abusive PI who lacked common sense.  From my perspective, in this case, I think it was more an issue of the professor and student both failing at interpersonal communications.  The professor wanted the student to spend some time doing an experiment that was going to obviously fail.  It could have been handled so much better by the student.  Even so there were some aspects of the professor that were abusively rigid (like insisting 7 years' work for a Ph.D.)",

In EECS you also needs departmental approval to go past 7 years so (standard is 6 - 2 for MS and 4 for PhD).\n\nThe vast majority of people I know that have left before finishing is due to burnout - or more specifically - lack of interest in doing research.  Basically they got 2 or 3 years in, decided they don't like doing research and didn't want to keep doing it and left with their M.S..",

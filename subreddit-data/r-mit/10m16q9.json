Enrollment for these classes is also quite high because other majors (16,20, 10 etc) require some of these to establish a base level experience in programming.",

What about the track specific classes? \n\nWhat are some classes that are considered a staple of MIT specifically? Like either infamous for a specific prof's way of teaching it or something unique not really offered anywhere else?",

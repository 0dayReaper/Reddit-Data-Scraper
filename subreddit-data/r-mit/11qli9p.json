I live with 2 roommates in a 3B1B and mostly cook my own meals. Local transport is going to very depending on how you choose to get around (would recommend biking), but an unlimited T pass is $90/month. Can\u2019t speak for the other numbers.",

Much more closer to MIT/Kendall Square. To get to that $1500/month number, you need to go out quite a ways or get lucky somewhere like Belmont or Watertown.",

I moved out of the Boston/Cambridge area this summer and I was spending only like half of this food budget as someone who doesn't eat out often. \n\nYou'll be just fine with this amount of money if you spend responsiby. There are certainly many other grad students squeezing by on less than this.",

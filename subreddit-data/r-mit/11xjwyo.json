MIT's financial planning folks see that and ask \"But what direct monetary return is that giving us?\". They see IS&amp;T as a big money sink (note, a few years ago they forced the sell-off of most of our IP addresses to solve this financial \"problem\"). But of course it's a sink, the point of IS&amp;T is to support the other parts of the Institute, not to generate cashflow itself.\n\nBut the modern attitude says \"Find the things that are costing more money than they produce, and gut them\". So now IS&amp;T doesn't have the resources they need to keep the network healthy and reliable. Ultimately, they're doing the best they can, but that's limited by poor decision-making on the part of the administration.",

Real leet haxors spun their filaments from raw fibers too, because it gave them nerd cred.

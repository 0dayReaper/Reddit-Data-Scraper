    "postText": "I was planning on applying to MIT as a transfer student. I know that there's a very low acceptance rate and therefore this is just hypothetical. I'm unsure of whether I want to major in electrical engineering or aerospace engineering. My current school doesn't offer aerospace engineering as an undergraduate degree and therefore I am in the electrical engineering department, however, I have taken classes related to aerospace engineering and am also working on a satellite at a research lab at my current university.   \n\n\nI was wondering if MIT allows transfer students to change majors? I couldn't find much on their website.\n\nThanks!",

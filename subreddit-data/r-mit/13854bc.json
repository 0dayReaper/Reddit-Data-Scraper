Winter can get really cold, and it rains a lot. It also gets dark super early in the winter. \n\nSo sure, I was outside every day. I'd walk to Central twice a week for Taekwondo. But except for a few blissful weeks at the beginning and end of the school year, Boston is just not a place I want to be outside in.",

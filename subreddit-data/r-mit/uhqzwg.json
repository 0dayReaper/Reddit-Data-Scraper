    "postText": "Hi, I am an undergrad who is going to doing a summer research internship at the institute. I am currently in the process of getting my Kerberos account set up, but in the meantime I cannot access the summer sublicense center here as I don't have the account: [https://sublicensecenter.mit.edu/](https://sublicensecenter.mit.edu/). I am a little worried that I am going to be limited in housing options as I do not know how long its going to take for the lab I'm working with to set up my account. Is this a valid concern? Are most of the on campus housing options already taken? If so, I know of other options that are available as well, like [https://www.mitoffcampus.com/](https://www.mitoffcampus.com/), craigslist, or facebook groups. Should I start looking over there as well in the meantime? I would greatly appreciate some advice on this. Please let me know if there is a better resource for this question or if I can provide any additional info.",

            "comment": "I think that the Harvard-MIT FB group is a pretty good place to find roommates and sublets. I found my old roommates on there and they were great -- we don't live together anymore but are still close friends. However, it might be harder to find a good housing fit if you're not able to come to Cambridge in person to meet potential roommates and see the space you'd be subletting.\n\nYou can also look at staying in an MIT frat over the summer (not sure if you'd be willing to consider this as an option, or if the frat housing is mostly full by now -- I'm too old to know what undergrad frats are doing).\n\nI also know people who've had success with long-term Airbnb stays, so you could look on there as well, but everyone I know who's done this either (a) did it in a different metro area or (b) had a large group of roommates going in and rented a whole house.",

I didn't even consider the frat option lol, I know a couple of people in frats but not close enough to ask to room I don't think. \n\nHave you heard of anyone using the MIT on-campus sublicense center that I provided above? It seems like the most ideal option atm, but as I mentioned, I'm not sure if there are any options available because I can't even browse available options without kerberos.",

            "comment": "Former MIT fraternity guy summer who lived in my house all 4 summers (also was a summer president at one point for whatever that\u2019s worth), so I can vouch for the MIT frats as a good place. Typically it\u2019s a cheaper option but they\u2019re typically mostly booked by this time. Will it be the cleanest? No. Will it possibly be loud and trashy? Yes. If you\u2019re okay with those things, give it a look. We had a ton of fun with our summer boarders, would occasionally plan summer events (beach trips, outings, social events within the house), and tried to include them in things if they were interested. We also had a ton of summer boarders who didn\u2019t want to be a part of anything either and they just kind of moved around as they saw fit. There is often a small population of the frat\u2019s members staying there over the summer who help do a lot of the heavy lifting on the logistical parts of maintaining the house (in exchange for not paying as much as a boarder), so you have \u201clocals\u201d you can ask questions to if you need help. \n\nUltimately, it will depend on what your priorities for social life, peace and quiet, living conditions, and budget are. If you\u2019re interested In social life or don\u2019t have a huge budget, it\u2019s a good option to consider.",

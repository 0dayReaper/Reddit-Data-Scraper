            "comment": "The coat you need will depend on how much time you actually spend outdoors.  I myself have a quite heavy coat that I have worn once in three years.  But if you live farther from main campus, or walk in the city to shop more, then a heavy coat would be a good investment.  If you\u2019re living in Maseeh and eating in the dining hall, a good hoodie might be pretty much all you need.  \n\nAlso worth noting in general is the fact that MIT keeps all its academic buildings quite warm.  Even in the depths of winter I am more comfortable indoors in short sleeves than even a thin long sleeve shirt",

The winter lasts a lot longer in Boston (spring and fall are really short, comparatively), and there's so much more snow. Soooo much more snow.\n\nThe summers are a lot hotter in Boston, so be prepared for that as well.",

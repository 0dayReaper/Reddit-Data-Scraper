Not sure if this is the correct place but I haven\u2019t been having much luck in the FB groups and don\u2019t know many folks from the Boston schools\n\nI\u2019m a senior (22M) who\u2019s graduating in May and will be working based in the Boston area. Was wondering if there are any graduating seniors who would be interested in rooming together starting June or July if working in Boston.\n\nFeel free to comment or PM me if interested",

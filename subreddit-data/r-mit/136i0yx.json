    "postText": "Hello everyone. I am studying Mechanical Engineering in an European university. And it has been my dream for many years to study in MIT. I get fascinated how perfectly professors in MIT can teach, there is no way to teach better than that probably. Unfortunately, I dont have such perfect professors, and sometimes some subjects are not taught well. The subject that I struggle with right now is called \"Machine elements\", and it is about bearings, belt drives, gears, etc. The professor is very bad. I always wondered how it would be to have videos about those topics from MIT on youtube. But unfortunately there are no videos about these subjects. I wondered if there is any MIT student who studies Mechanical Engineering that could help me. It may be lecture notes that they have, some materials for reading may be, or even videos. I would really appreciate it. Hope I will be MIT student too, one day....",

    "postText": "I was deciding between MIT and harvard to honestly the last hour of commit day (i know i'm very fortunate to have this \"problem\"). MIT has been my dream school since I attended one of their summer programs, and CPW just confirmed its awesomeness for me. I also attended visitas, harvard's version of CPW. It felt far more underwhelming but I also only stayed for 1 day and it was raining and dreary the whole time. I feel like I didn't give harvard a fair shot. I've been talking with other cross admits and most of them chose harvard; I can't help feel like maybe I didn't make the \"right\" decision. \n\nI guess my main concerns are MIT's workload and how much I'll grow as a person, socially (I'm very introverted, so MIT felt like a way better cultural fit than harvard. But I also worry that I won't learn to stretch myself socially at MIT). And if looking back 10 years from now, will I have been happy that I went and got MIT done and over with, or be able to say that I was overall happy at MIT (I get MIT teaches you how to work hard, and you'll definitely not be happy all the time, ihtfp afterall, but I'm also just really burnt-out from the whole college app process to where I don't know if my mental health will be up for 4 years of firehose intensity academics).",

You'd been fine at Harvard too but eh, you can still get a taste of it via the cross registration MIT x Harvard offered on some course iirc.\n\nCongrats on getting in. Enjoy the ride :)",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nA year ago I was in similar shoes to you, deciding between MIT and Princeton, waiting up until the last moments of April to submit my commitment form. I have had second thoughts as well, but ultimately I believe MIT is a great fit for me in many ways and I've been having a good time here.\n\nHere is my perspective:\n\n1. You don't have to be forced into the firehose. While there is a culture of over-exerting yourself among many MIT students, and there are certain required time-consuming classes depending on your major, you can make many choices to make your life easier. Stick with the normal and expected courseload of 4 classes per semester - the credit limit is a LIMIT, not a requirement. You don't need to graduate early or start your MEng or get a perfect 5.0 gpa - this is a time to slow down and enjoy the ride of college rather than fighting for perfection the way we did in high school. There are choices you can make to make your life miserable, but there are also choices you can make to make your life enjoyable. \n2. MIT is a couple of blocks away from Harvard. If you yearn for a bit of that liberal arts culture or that dark academia vibe, you have some options to experience it. All MIT students can set up a Harvard library card, so you can study at their libraries anytime. Cross registration is an option starting sophomore year. You can go to performances and parties if you know people there, which my friends and I have done a couple times.\n3. If you want to stretch yourself socially, there are many opportunities to do that at MIT. 2.00b is a super fun intro to product design course that's very popular for students to take in freshman spring, and a core part of it is teamwork and learning to confidently give a presentation. You can also consider joining a dorm with a more social culture (baker, new vassar, maseeh) or a fraternity/sorority.\n4. Try to relax this summer. The summer between senior year of high school and freshman year of college, I didn't work at an internship or try to intensely study anything, I just tied up a bit of research work from a previous summer, biked around all day, and hung out with my friends. After years of hard work, burnout is real, and it was really beneficial for me to take a good 3 months to chill.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have more questions. Deciding between HYPSM is really tough, but I know many cross-admits who are thriving here, and I'm sure you will too :)",

Before attending cpw I wasn\u2019t sure how much I would \u201cfit\u201d at mit, but i met some of the most amazing ppl who i didn\u2019t expect to find at mit and saw so many other different groups that i\u2019m sure mit has a circle for everyone to fit into. Balancing the workload with other priorities will def be a challenge, but we were adMITted for a reason, so keep that in mind.",

And I guarantee you 100% that if you go to every class and email your TAs questions (which is their job), you will get an A in every class.\n\nFor social: you think there aren't \"dorks\" at Harvard? MIT is a great place to become as social as you want. You can join 100s of fun clubs, a few dozen of work/professional clubs, and of course there's dozens of dorm communities where you don't have to live there to go to their parties. Not to mention many many frats + soroities.\n\nI will say, if you will be spending all day in your room and not doing anything, then Harvard and MIT will both not let you grow. But if you make an effort at either place to spend time with people, you will \"stretch yourself socially\"\n\nSo basically, both of your assumptions are wrong! But no worries, this is your first of many things you'll learn at MIT :)",

    "postText": "What is the functional difference between the new 6-2 track and the old one? Is the new one replacing the old one, because I've heard that it actually isn't and that it has something to do with the new college of computing and that they're something separate but somehow the same? Can someone please explain? Thank you.",

However, the 6-2 changes are rather strange in that they relaxed the requirement of doing CE-related courses, and made it much easier to do EE courses that have little relevance to CE.  \n\nAccording to the [curriculum transition page](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/2022-curriculum-transition/), you can choose the old *or* the new one if you start *before* this fall.  If you have trouble deciding, just pick the old one, since you can switch to new requirements anytime you want, but you can't go back to the old requirements once you've signed up for the new one (this is standard at all US colleges).  Also, choosing the old one will allow more flexibility in general, especially if a certain requirement is un-satisfiable, the dept. will give you more free rein.",

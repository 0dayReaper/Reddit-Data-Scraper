If you get the two bed apartment, the larger room is pretty. So the one to avoid is the two bed smaller unit i.e. C1 or F1",

Had roaches when I shifted in because flatmate's sublet was superrr messy. Pest control guy came in the day after I filed a complaint and came in again after a month. We haven't had any roach problems since 2 to 3 weeks after the first visit",

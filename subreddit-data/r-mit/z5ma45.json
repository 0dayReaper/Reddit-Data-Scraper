            "comment": "As a ChemE, there\u2019s no coding class requirement on its own. What you will have, however, is Matlab built into several classes. 10.10, the intro to ChemE spends at least a third of the semester teaching Matlab basics. Then, it will come up again in the intermediate 10.213 and 10.302 classes for the most part. After that, it really depends. A lot of folks find it helpful to take the intro to python classes from the Computer science department, but that is just for programming experience: python is not required for any undergraduate required class. A seperate software used for modeling large scale chemical processes is called Aspen, but that is not really programming. This is used in some of the capstone classes, and a biological version is used in some other classes.",

If you aren\u2019t a genius coming into the school (eg. my chem knowledge is vvv spotty and i\u2019m definitely not as smart/high achieving as most of the admits, never did competition math or any olympiads, etc) is it hard to keep up in classes?

            "comment": "I feel like MIT might just be the worst college out there in terms of stress, workload, and grade deflation. One thing that all alumni say is that everything after MIT undergrad, be it a job, a PhD, or anything else, is literally a walk in the park. \n\nHowever, it's not like it isn't rewarding. You see yourself grow so much. Classes get progressively harder, but you become progressively better at handling them. Freshman PNR is there to ease you in, and you have to choose which way you want to roll. If you're happy with a C, you could have a pretty chill time. If you're aiming for an A, it's going to be a constant grind. \n\nSometimes I feel like if I'd gone to another school, I wouldn't have to cope with so much stress and anxiety, and I would have a much better social life. But I'm honestly happy I'm at MIT because I really don't care about the *college experience*. That's not why I'm here; I came here to become an engineer, and that's what I'm focused on. It's just 4 years of my life, I've made friends, I've met amazing people, and I have no regrets. \n\nThe people who are struggling the most, I feel like, are the ones who put academics second. You have to be motivated to go through the struggle; earning a C at MIT is hard. Earning an A isn't impossible, but it's way more work than you could expect. People who do well here are the ones who put in the most work, honestly. Even if there are people who are doing better because they are more experienced, you can get there with enough time and effort. The question is, are you willing to/able to put that much time and effort in.\n\nEdit: typos",

However he passed everything quite easily. They don't give you actual grades your first freshman semester, so that's good for you to think on. But you can of course figure your grade yourself, **and he got all As.**\n\n*Once again, admitted from a public high school in the midwest, started from a deficit but still got all A's his first semester.*\n\nThe only caveat I have for you is that he has said that he finds it very difficult to have any time to join a club or group or anything like that. \n\nHe did a little bit of some sport on Saturday mornings last semester. \n\nThis semester he's doing something back home so he has actually been back in the Midwest for 3 day weekends two separate times since this semester started and he's still keeping up just fine.",

            "comment": "MIT has a reputation - both to outsiders and on-campus - of having a terrible workload, too much stress, etc. To be honest, I think a lot of it is overblown. \n\nFirst, the IHTFP culture can be toxic in that it pressures people to be busy and suffering, often for no good reason. If you aren't constantly \"hosed\", you should feel bad about not doing enough. If you do well on an exam, you should shut up about it, even though statistically MIT students do quite well on most exams. Fortunately, getting out of this vicious cycle is a personal choice, one that I see more and more of my friends taking. You don't have to take seven classes just because your genius math olympiad friend is taking eight. You don't have to join a bunch of clubs just so your resume will look good in three years. Once you realize how amazing an environment MIT is without all of the baggage, you won't have any second thoughts about those other schools.\n\nThe grade deflation is bad relative to e.g. Harvard, but it is humbling and helps you to grow - you stop worrying about getting straight A's or whatever standard you had for yourself in high school, and instead take classes for the sake of learning. Classes are hard by design, but for the most part, the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. If everyone could keep up with all the classes, what would be the challenge? (I want to refer you to [this](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/surviving-mit/) MIT admissions post. I know a lot of them can be cheesy and over-the-top but this one is worth reading before coming to campus.)\n\nThere is definitely time to go to parties and hang out with friends (on a regular basis). The MIT fraternities are the heart of Boston's university party scene every weekend. Even if you're not into that, MIT is ideally placed, close to Cambridge, Allston, and of course Boston. Go out and explore, eat great food, meet awesome people - do whatever fun things you want, because that's what college is about. MIT doesn't preclude you from having a good experience, it just simultaneously enhances that experience with a good dosage of intensity and nerdiness. (And if you come to CPW, you'll see firsthand what I mean!)\n\nBTW feel free to dm, I'm a current '23 studying 18 and 6-3.",

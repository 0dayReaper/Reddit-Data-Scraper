My WiFi connection to MIT secure was working the last two days but suddenly cannot connect anymore (\"Failed to establish network connection\"--correct password, can connect to Guest so not a driver issue).

I haven't had the same issue, but for me, sometimes it would connect w/o internet, sometimes it wouldn't connect at all, and sometimes I would make a sacrifice to the wifi gods on the 3rd floor of 38 and have stable internet for the day. \ud83d\ude44",

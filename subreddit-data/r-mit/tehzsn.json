    "postText": "Hi :) I was accepted today, but there was a document missing from my IDOC (which I\u2019ve now submitted) so I didn\u2019t get a financial aid package yet. I know that time will tell how much I get in need-based aid, but I\u2019m a little hesitant to celebrate my acceptance when I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll be possible for me to go.\n\nSo my question is, what are the chances that I get good financial aid? Obviously no one can know for sure, but for reference, my EFC is 7800. I got into UVA also, where the total cost of attending was 70k, and I was granted 35k in need-based scholarships - any guesses as to how this financial situation might translate to MIT?\n\nAlso last question, any guesses as to how long it will take to hear back about financial after submitting the missing documents?\n\nThank you in advance and congrats to other admits!",

It\u2019s likely you\u2019ll hear back well before the decision date, and if you have a competing earlier decision date you should send them an email and ask politely if they can expedite it.",

            "comment": "MIT gave me a pretty great package! Everyone told me that if you could get into an Ivy+ school, you could get full ride and stipends from your local state school, but that's not the case at all especially with places like UVA. MIT (and Caltech) gave me way better deals than any of the state schools I got into, including the one that I got into the Honors College for. \n\nSFS can move slowly for sure. I also had missing documents a few years ago, but they got back to me before commitment day. The one thing I'd say here is, if your final package looks suspiciously low, then it's worth calling the financial aid office and seeing what's up. I had a friend who got no aid from Harvard despite having a sibling going to school at the same time she was, and then it turned out that somehow, her sibling got completely erased off her financial aid documents during consideration.",

I was also able to successfully appeal my aid offer (for more) when one of my parents was out of work one year. \n\nMy sister went to two different universities (one public, one private) for undergrad (transferred partway through) and neither was as generous as MIT despite us being in the same financial situation.",

            "comment": "Financially, MIT is definitely the smarter choice here. You'll need to come up with your EFC *ONLY* to go to MIT. \n\nUVA is telling you you'll need to come up with the other entire half!! 35k a year? That's where everyone's ridiculous student loans come from.\n\nMIT is one of about 10 to 20 universities in the United States that *guarantees full-need is met.*\n\nThat means they will put a $ package together for you that meets all of your financial need to attend. Your \"need\" is defined as everything above $7800 (your efc) a year. \n\nSo you/your fam will need to come up with about 4k per semester. You can pay that over a couple months (3? I think maybe 4, sorry I can't remember exactly as my husband pays the bills). So let's say you'll need to come up with 1000 a month August to Nov and Jan to April). \n\n**I cannot TELL you how much of a deal that is for MIT!!**\n\nIf your family doesn't have any savings somewhere for your college that you could use for that $1000 a month, you can do things like getting a private loan, getting a job yourself, a combination etc.\n\n**THERE ARE WAYS TO SAVE ON THIS AMOUNT THOUGH!!**\n\n1. Get a triple dorm room instead of a double. CostS estimated by MIT are generally based on a double dorm room I believe. Aim for a cheaper dorm if that exists. I can't remember if the amounts for dorms vary. But if they do, aim for a cheaper one and a triple.\n\nMy kid ended up in a triple and we saw our monthly payment amount drop significantly.\n\n2. MIT makes you buy their health insurance and that cost is figured into your tuition and fees. However, if you already have decent health insurance from parents job where MIT thinks that you can get a doctor pretty readily in the Boston Cambridge area, they will not make you pay for their own health insurance. Unfortunately this is completely up to them, they choose if they think that yours is good enough to cover what you might need in Boston or Cambridge. (Well it's kind of them, it's not MIT itself it's a company that MIT hires to run this program.)\n\nDuring my kid's first semester we paid for the MIT one. Basically they said my husband's insurance from his job wasn't good enough and didn't apply to the area well enough to protect my son.  \n\nHowever this semester my husband's work got a different insurance and we submitted that one to MIT and they decided that one was perfectly fine and good enough. And again that knocked our monthly payments down significantly when that charge came off his bill.\n\n*So you're $1,000 a month could potentially end up being $700 a month.*\n\nAgain, UVA sounds like they're offering you jack shit to be honest. And for a student of your caliber? IE you got into MIT!! UVA should be busting down your door. And they're stupid for not giving you much more. \n\nYou really need to go with MIT or any other college that is \"guaranteed all need met.\"",

                    "comment": "Just adding to this, MIT has a specific office for paying students to do research. At most schools, you either have to work as a volunteer or get your advisor to pay for you (which often won't happen until you're a semester in at least). Not only this make it easier to find research opportunities since professors don't have to pay, but it also means you can make money doing resume-building work. (Granted, there's a cap on how many hours of UROP you can get paid for, but it still helps.) \n\n&gt;Again, UVA sounds like they're offering you jack shit to be honest. And for a student of your caliber? IE you got into MIT!! UVA should be busting down your door. And they're stupid for not giving you much more.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of state schools are overwhelmed with demand. As a result, they not only have to stretch their dollar thinner, but they also have a huge pool with many very excellent students, many of whom won't get into Ivy+ schools. The acceptance rate at MIT was \\~4% last year and \\~7% before that; getting in requires either a godly resume or some amount of luck. It's not feasible for them to offer many full rides, and they often don't hone in on the same students who got into say, MIT. \n\nMy state schools were the UCs, which were very high in demand. If I didn't go, someone with the same (or better) scores, grades, and comparable extraccurriculars would have gladly gone. Consequently, UCLA only gave me 10k/year. A few kids at my school got way more, almost full rides, and none of those kids got into Ivy+ schools. My friend (who also went to MIT) got 1 cent of financial aid from UCLA...Not that he needed it, but you get the idea.",

Unfortunately just based off your EFC, it'll be hard to tell how much aid MIT will give since the CSS profile collects A LOT more information than FAFSA and then there's special circumstance and all that.\n\nEdit: If you got into any other schools with aid policies similar to MIT, that might be a good baseline. UVA is a public that doesn't seem to meet full need, so probably not a good comparison.",

I know of people who had typos in their FAFSA which affected their financial aid.",

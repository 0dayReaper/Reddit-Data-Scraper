These are Walter Lewin's Physics series and Anant Agrawal's Circuit Analysis series.\n\nI was looking for discord servers for the above mentioned couldn't find any official ones (it was obvious that 8.0x won't have one but 6.002x doesn't either!).\n\nIf anyone knows about these discords servers, please inform, else I would be happy to create them.",

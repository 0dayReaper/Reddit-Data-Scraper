    "postText": "Hey all, I'm a Harvard student looking to cross-register this fall. 6.170 (or whatever the new course number is) looks pretty interesting, but I haven't taken something like 6.031 before. I've never programmed with JavaScript either, but I have taken a decent amount of programming-intensive courses. Would I be okay if I decide to take 6.170? And how useful is the course in general? \n\nThanks in advance, I don't really know where else to get more info about MIT classes.",

Idk what \u201cdecent amount of programming-intensive courses\u201d adds up to, but I don\u2019t think MIT students ever take this class without 6.031. \n\nI\u2019m taking it this semester after not doing super well but enjoying 031 and I\u2019m intimidated but excited. \n\nMaybe look into taking 6.031 instead and then 6.170 next year if you\u2019re not a \u201823? \n\nHope someone else comments to give you more info. Like I said, not taken it yet, but hope this helps a bit.",

            "comment": "6170 was one of the hardest labs I\u2019ve taken but I think it\u2019s relatively easy among the junior level lab classes in all the course 6 offerings at the time (early 2000s). Plus it was Java, not JavaScript. Not sure if that\u2019s changed. It is very practical; the final project was an ai for anti-chess.",

The current iteration of 6.170 is a web design class using JavaScript and reactive frameworks, and the final project is typically building a website of some kind.\n\nOP, I\u2019d recommend that you email the professors and describe your experience &amp; interest. They can probably let you know if the class will be at the right difficulty level for you.",

It's good to have an environment where everyone is on the same page with vaccinations against certain diseases - the risk of those diseases drops drastically and also at high enough rates protects those who medically cannot get vaccines. So MIT chooses to enforce it's vaccination by saying you are not allowed to partake in their courses unless you meet their standards. Getting in and paying tuition aren't the only requirements for being allowed to take classes\n\nAs for why it's enforced at registration and not some other point - that's a matter of convenience. You don't have to check in with them every time you eg go on campus for a lecture. But they CAN stop you from making progress on your degree by preventing you from telling them what courses you want to take",

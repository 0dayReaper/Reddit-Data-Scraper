    "postText": "Hi . I am thinking of transferring from uni of london (comp science).right now i am doing my degree online through UoL (on coursera) but I would prefer to have classes in person and actually have a college experience so I am making up a list of schools to transfer to and MIT is my dream school. But i am not too sure if MIT would allow me to transfer credits since I am doing my studying online..\n\nRight now I have a first and looking to get a first class honors but still not sure if MIT or any uni like Stanford etc. Would accept my credits.\n\nDo I need to then apply as first year? And repeat the years? Please help. I emailed them too but haven't yet gotten a reply\nreply.",

It sounds like they might have to apply as a transfer student because this year\u2019s deadline has already passed, and, I believe, you can\u2019t apply as a freshman if you\u2019ve attended another school for more than a year",

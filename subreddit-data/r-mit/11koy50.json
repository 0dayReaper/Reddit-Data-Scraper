I am considering both on-campus and off-campus options. Feel free to give any relevant (or not so relevant) advice!",

Tang also has a decent social presence, but the rooms are old and have a weird smell imo.\n\nOff-campus is just a hassle because of utilities and all these weird fees you have to pay. Also, the maintenance for on-campus residences is super solid in my opinion compared to what you would get off-campus.\n\nI think overall Sid-Pac is probably the best, but if you don't mind having to furnish the apartment (it's not hard, you can order everything on Amazon basically lol), Edgerton is a solid pick --&gt; Good location, relatively inexpensive, decent mix of social events, solid gym, and also a really nice music room in my opinion.",

I think it is more typical generally for first year students to live in the graduate dorms, it just saves a lot of headache honestly. You shouldn't have too much trouble finding a 2 bed 1 bath or something you can hop into on the housing portal. Just make sure to do your due diligence if you are going for a random roommate, as I've heard some bad stories from my current roommate about getting matched with disrespectful/asshole roommates.",

The portal will give you some information about potential roommates if the person decided to fill out their bio, but if not, I usually just try to find them on Linkedin or other social media sites to see what they're about. It's best if you can choose someone who is at least in the same major as you so you have some common ground, and also someone who might have more similar cultural background as cultural norms can vary vastly across people of different nationalities, and that can definitely be a cause of roommate dissatisfaction/troubles.\n\nMy philosophy is that if you can't find them on Linkedin or any social media for that matter, it's probably not worth the risk.",

If you're planning to stay for a PhD, I would try to live on campus or join an existing student apartment for your first year, and then definitely live off-campus after your first year (probably with other students).\n\nBasic info for on-campus:\n\n* Rent is higher than off-campus, but includes utilities\n* You (probably) don't need to buy or bring furniture\n* You don't need to pay a lot of money upfront\n* You will probably end up living with random other MIT students\n* It can be hard to get on-campus housing in the lottery\n\nBasic info for off-campus:\n\n* Rent is (IMO much) cheaper, especially if you know where to get good deals (joining an existing lease is a good way to start)\n* When you sign a lease, you will probably have to pay first month, last month, broker fee, and security deposit up front, which can be equivalent to 3+ months of rent upfront\n* You'll probably need furniture\n* You have control over who you live with\n* You get to live in an actual neighborhood rather than a college campus (IMO this has big psychological benefits, and helps with work-life balance + feeling like you're putting down roots)\n* This is the way to go if you're living with an SO/partner/spouse\n\nBasically, you pay more up front but save money in the long run living off-campus, but if you're only here for a couple of years, you might not be off-campus long enough to break even. If you move off-campus, I would recommend looking in East Cambridge or the Spring Hill/Porter Square area of Somerville for nice, affordable neighborhoods that are reasonably close to MIT.",

There are a lot of scams out there.",

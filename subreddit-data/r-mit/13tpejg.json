    "postText": "My boyfriend and I will be moving into Cambridge for his PhD at MIT soon. We're both coming from places where asking for essentially three months rent upfront several months away from move-in is not normal (excluding broker fees).\n\nA lot of the apartments we're looking at are asking for security deposit, first month's rent, and last month's rent upon signing the lease even if we're three months away from moving in. Is this normal? What are your experiences with renting in Boston/Cambridge?\n\nWe would appreciate all the insight we can get before dropping several thousands of dollars all at once.\n\nThanks!\n\nETA: Thank you everyone who contributed in the comments. My boyfriend and I decided to go ahead and sign the lease. I really appreciate everyone\u2019s insight and wish everyone the best.",

There are also a lot of scam listings out there though, so general advice is not to rent anywhere you haven't seen in person! Obviously this is extra hard if you haven't moved here yet from elsewhere, but if you can tour apartments during a weekend visit to the city, have a friend here who can look at units for you, or find a shared unit with someone already in your grad school department, those are all ways of gaining some confidence that you'll really have a place to live before handing over those thousands of dollars.",

I mean, I'm sure people find ways to scam you through MIT's website, but is there any credibility to listings found here? The place we're currently looking at is owned my an MIT alum. Do you think that offers viable credibility as well?",

And there are a lot of alumni out there - hard to say that affiliation is a guarantee of anything. Sorry to sound kind of negative about all this, but it's way better to be cautious than scammed, and there are SO MANY stories of apartment scams in the area!",

Getting lots of feedback (particularly from r/boston who are... very upset with Boston renting) and all of this is really helpful. Our potential landlord just reached out to us and things are looking a bit more hopeful. Regardless, I hope it works out for the best :)",

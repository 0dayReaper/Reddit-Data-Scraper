    "postText": "Hey guys, \n\nAn MIT '26 beaver here! I'm studying for the 7.012 ASE, which is set to happen on July 25th :). \n\nI was wondering what past ASEers for Bio would recommend using to study in 2022. There are a lot of previous posts about this topic but ever since 2018 MIT added a new 7.016 course to OpenCourseWare (taught by the two new professors: Martin and Imperiali), which I have been using to study. \n\nPrevious threads have been hinting at the campbell/reese book and also the 2004 MIT OCW lectures. Since these threads are now outdated, I was wondering if this opinion changes with this new OCW course MIT put up, especially in relation to the ASE. \n\nThanks for your guys' help in advance--definitely don't want to be studying the wrong stuff!",

            "comment": "My knowledge might be outdated, but: the 7.01x variants all basically start off the same (biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology) and then only differ in the last ~half or third. IIRC, the ASE mostly focuses on that core content, which also probably hasn't really changed that much (Biology changes fast, but like, transcription still reads 3-&gt;5' and builds 5-&gt;3'.). I would focus on those first subjects, and then if you have time a little recombinant DNA, neurobiology, and maybe immunology.",

                    "comment": "Thanks, this is super helpful. Does the ASE lack material in its entirety on topics such as recombinant DNA, neurobiology, and immunology? Also, different 7.01x give either free response exams or a mix of MC and free response. Does the ASE cater to the ladder?",

I'd think if you had really solid mastery of the earlier sections, let's say there was one question on neuro and you had no clue, you could probably still pass overall even bombing one or two questions. I think a bulk of it is free response, like short answer, maybe drawing arrows or lines, things like that.",

            "comment": "Took it last year and iirc, there were a lot of genetics and recombinant DNA questions. That was also the content I thought was hardest.\n\nI mostly studied by watching the 7.01SC videos and going through PSETs/exams from the 7.01x classes. Thought AP Bio was pretty helpful tbh, although the ASE doesn\u2019t go into ecology/evolution. It focuses more on the biochem/molecular bio stuff, and again genetics and recombinant dna.\n\nThere were a few questions about immunology that I didn\u2019t study for, and tbh just guessed/bs\u2019ed my way through. Still passed though.\n\nGood luck!",

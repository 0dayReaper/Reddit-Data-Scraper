    "postText": "With the recent explosion of AI tools such as ChatGPT/MidJourney/Lensa, I have personally had mixed feelings. On one hand, I think they could be incredibly useful as an assistant for gaining knowledge rapidly, learning a new field, and increasing productivity, but on the other hand, I think we need to be mindful about how these tools could influence the human psyche. For example, the Midjourney AI tool is an awesome tool for generating high quality art and digital designs, but I have mixed feelings because the tool will inevitably increase human expectations. Ultimately, we are going to be able to make cool stuff, but since everyone will be able to do it, it's not going to be cool anymore. So with all of these new tools, where is the room for human creativity? Hard work? Imagine, a human spent years and years of hard work studying to be an artist, and now an AI tool has shown the capability to do effectively the same thing at no cost. How is that fair? If someone like a graphic designer can get replaced that easily, what about everyone else? In light of this, how should we be spending our time? I am personally a bit concerned that technology is going to begin advancing at a rate that humans cannot keep up with, and it could be extremely dangerous if we are not careful. \n\nI imagine a future where making mind-blowing art is no longer mind-blowing (it is just normal), making mind-blowing videos is no longer mind-blowing (it is just normal), etc. As human expectations increase rapidly, I struggle to see how AI won't be ubiquitous, and I'm not sure if that's a future we want.\n\nTL;DR: I suspect AI tools are going to continue to grow rapidly and become commonplace. Are these tools a net positive or negative? How should we be using them?",

Great art establishes an emotional connection, and AI is just lowering the skill level required to put the idea(which is what is important) into reality",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI'm having trouble finding Slacks/Discord servers/FB groups/etc. for grad students. I'm interested in connecting with people and talking about housing options/roomates and other new student sorts of things. \n\nI tried emailing the Grad Student Council (no response) as well an advisor in my program (not helpful). I tried joining the MIT Students server found in the MIT school group on Discord, but the join bot is dead.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks!",

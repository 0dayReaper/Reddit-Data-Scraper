            "comment": "I\u2019ve been working on it on and off since they released yesterday (a lot of long procrastination and tv breaks). I think it all depends on your reading and writing style, but I suspect for most to do it thoroughly it will take more than 6 hours. The readings are very lengthy (about 90 pages including figures and citations), but you could probably bulldoze through the articles in under 2 hours and write in 4 hours but it might be very challenging.\n\nWhile doing these types of assignments, I like to take my time on the reading and outlining in the hopes of quickly doing the writing quickly. I have spent a lot of time reading the articles closely, annotating, taking notes, and writing summaries in the hopes of later distilling this into the actual essay.\n\nI\u2019d say you should block off more than 6 hours probably at least a day or more depending on how fast you read and write.",

    "postText": " Hi,  I was looking for housing here earlier so sorry if this seems like a  repost. I got a short term lease that I have just found out is getting  cut short, and so I am once again asking here if anyone is looking to  lease an apartment and needs a roommate.\n\nI'm  a (male 21 y/o) recent graduate from Northeastern, and I am looking to  rent in the Cambridge area with a group starting September 1st. I am  looking to live close to the red line so that I can use the Alewife  shuttle to commute to Waltham.\n\nPlease DM me if you're interested in searching together or if you have a place and need an extra roommate :)",

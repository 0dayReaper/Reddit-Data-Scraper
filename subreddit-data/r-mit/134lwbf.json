I tried using it for the last 6 months every day just to refresh my memory on material from class, but to be honest I don\u2019t know if it really helped me all that much given how much time I had to put in.\n\nDoes anyone actually find value from using Anki? If so how?",

Or CORE knowledge you need for long term you can come back once in a while. \n\nWhen you say 6 months, are you studying for classes you\u2019re currently taking? Past classes? \n\nAnother thing I think is depending on the class, memorization is less important to learning than problem-solving. As in, the things you memorize are not the main things you gain from college, but problem-solving is. \n\nFor example thermodynamics I hear is a memorization heavy class, so I can see Anki being helpful while you\u2019re taking the class. But for things like DS+A, you can use Anki to memorize basic pieces of knowledge, but after that it\u2019s mainly your problem solving skills.",

                    "comment": "The flashcards I make aren\u2019t typically just rote memorization, but instead I add flashcards whenever I \u201clearn\u201d something, meaning whenever I gain a piece of knowledge that I didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t make sense to me before that point. This can include rote memorization when I learn a new word for example, but it can also include learning new steps for solving a problem (i.e. one side of the flashcard is \u201cWhat did you learn/realize to solve this problem?\u201d and the other side explains the thought process that I learned to solved the problem). \n\nI\u2019ve found this to be pretty good way of retaining things you\u2019ve learned in classes, but sometimes it can just feel overwhelming when I can\u2019t remember the answers for information on the cards. Still I feel like this works for me at least because I can forget things quickly if I don\u2019t use it.",

So if you are looking to use Anki as an aid for math or CS classes, it probably won't help that much, especially since some exams will let you bring a cheat sheet to take care of the dirty rote mem work.",

N1 itself won't open any doors necessarily; jobs or experiences that require fluent Japanese are more likely to measure by just interacting with you in Japanese. At MIT, you could get in touch with the Japanese language instructors to see if they run or know of any on-campus communities where you could practice or look into exchanges as suggested by others.",

    "postText": "I am excited to attend the CPW. But if possible, I also would like to take my mom on a short campus tour. Given that CPW is only for students and they are conducting a separate virtual session for parents, is it still possible to show the campus to my mom during the CPW timeframe? I mean, is(are) there any approval(s) required from the college? She is all I have and I have to do this, as it is a, dream come true despite tough odds, situation for us. \nAny advice will be of great help. TIA\nI apologise if this query is not per the sub\u2019s  rules &amp; etiquette.",

Taking her on a tour is completely allowed all year, and you'll see plenty of tourists too. \nSpecific cpw events are more for admitted students and may require the event's coordinator approval to have your mom here but a generic tour of campus (and other \"for public\" events) anyone is welcome to",

    "postText": "I know Project Manus has a 3D printing service, but it looks like they use FDM, and I'm specifically looking for SLA because my project requires higher print resolution. I read through [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/3s6w4l/anyone_know_about_3d_printing_services_on_campus/) (posted 6 years ago), and at that time, it didn't seem there were any SLA printers available to the public. Was wondering if that's changed at all, any thoughts or insight would be greatly appreciated!",

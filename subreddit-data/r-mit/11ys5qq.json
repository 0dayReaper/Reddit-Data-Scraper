    "postText": "Hello everybody, MIT Horizon is hosting a free online event next week, Thursday March 30 12pm, with Jeremy Lasky, a co-founder of the motion graphics studio Perception which creates concept technology for the Marvel cinematic universe. Jeremy will give a brief presentation followed by Q&amp;A. Here are the details and the Zoom link for registration:\n\n**Title:**  Science Fiction Thinking: From Wakanda to Reality \n\nDescription:  Where does science fiction meet reality, and how can it inspire future innovation? Jeremy Lasky, co-founder of Perception, a motion graphics studio, will join us for a discussion of Perception's unique [Science Fiction Thinking](http://experienceperception.com/sci-fi-thinking/) design process and how it drove the creation of the [mixed reality interfaces](https://www.experienceperception.com/work/black-panther-wakanda-forever-technology/) in the Black Panther movie series. The presentation will explore some of the great inspiration from the original architect of the Marvel Universe Jack Kirby, Black Panther's visionary creator, and dive into the use of science fiction as a wellspring of creativity for technological innovation. Lasky will take questions from the audience at the end of his presentation. \n\nSpeaker bio:  **Jeremy Lasky** started his career at r/GA after graduating from Carnegie Mellon University, where he studied graphic design, architecture, and business. For five-plus years, he led design efforts for feature films, global ad agencies, and broadcast networks at r/GA. In the fall of 2001, Lasky co-founded [Perception](https://www.experienceperception.com/), a cutting-edge motion graphics studio that led the revolution in creating design and visual effects on the desktop. The studio has sharpened its focus to become a global expert in designing futuristic user interfaces for feature films and for the most powerful brands in technology. From \u201cIron Man\u201d to IBM, from \u201cThe Avengers\u201d to SpaceX, the studio has a unique niche that bridges the gap between sci-fi and science fact. Lasky leads new business strategies and shapes the company\u2019s growth while overseeing a full-time staff. \n\n**Registration link:** [**https://mit.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN\\_D2Fq4zcURPuK1PqGGqAtSA**](https://mit.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_D2Fq4zcURPuK1PqGGqAtSA)\n\nEvent time: Mar 30, 2023 12:00 PM \n\n(MIT Horizon is a corporate education platform, part of the MIT Open Learning group.)",

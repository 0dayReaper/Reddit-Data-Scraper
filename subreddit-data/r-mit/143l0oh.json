    "postText": "Hello, I was curious if MIT had labs that are open to MIT students with ultrawide monitors. My lab has some tiny iPad size monitors and I really prefer wide monitors for my workflow. A quiet space equipped with some good monitors would be great for me.\n\nOr perhaps I might be able to loan them out as equipment or something like that? Anything helps\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

If you head past the bathrooms from the main room second floor you should get to a quiet working area with what I\u2019d consider to be some pretty ballin\u2019 monitors. I hope that works!",

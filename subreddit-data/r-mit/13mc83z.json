    "postText": "Throwaway account. I'm a prefrosh.\n\nI got off a waitlist recently, so now I have to decide between Stanford and MIT for undergrad. Of course, they are both fantastic colleges, so I would be content going to either, but for some reason I feel extremely nervous every time my hand hovers over a \"commit\" button. But here are the facts:\n\n* Based on my aid offers, MIT will be much cheaper (around half the price) of Stanford.\n* Right now, I'm not really looking into research, mostly industry. I have some vague idea of making a startup, but I also don't want to, like, make something just for the sake of it; only if I have an idea of what I want to do.\n* I want to be more ambitious in life, ideally, but right now I think I'm more intellectual than ambitious\u2014whatever that means.\n* I'm from the West Coast, so I've had the quote-unquote \"amazing Stanford weather\" my whole life; so I'm open to trying other weather options, but obviously Stanford weather is still great.\n* I somewhat like the culture at MIT more, if only because it felt like there are more people with my specific interests at MIT. But I'm sure I could fit in at Stanford, they seem like great people too.\n* I'm worried about the course load at MIT, because from people I talked to it seemed like the course load is significantly large and students spend a lot of their time studying, at the very least much more than Stanford. I could *probably* take a higher course load, but to be honest (I swear this is not humblebrag, it's a legit fact, sorry), I haven't spent much time on coursework during high school at all (maybe like max 60 minutes/day on regular nights, i.e. nights without projects/papers). And I haven't really studied for exams much. So I don't think I have good enough study habits for super heavy courseloads.\n\nThanks for your input, it is greatly valued!\n\n**EDIT:** Thanks so much everyone for your insights, I just committed to MIT!",

If you don't go over 4 classes a semester and don't procrastinate, the courseload is manageable with decent sleep and a social life. Many MIT students follow highly successful paths in industry especially in CS and mechE, and has a bunch of entrepreneurship related programs, so you're in a good spot on that front. Feel free to PM me with any more questions and good luck w your decision, hope you end up here :)",

You want to maybe do a startup: MIT has 2-3 different funds you can pitch to\n3. MIT will nurture you in being an intellectual and/or ambitious (\"whatever that means\")\n4. MIT weather may not be great\n5. MIT is a better culture fit\n6. MIT is hard\n\nSo sounds like everything is... perfect! Except for #4 and #6.\n\n4. Who cares? You have A/C, you have heat. And I assure you, your friends are going to make plans and have fun regardless of the weather (as long as you have non-California friends). MIT nor Boston \"shuts down\" in the winter, so just buy a coat and enjoy the weather!\n\n6. You can graduate with a guaranteed 4.0/5:\n\n1. You take 4 classes a semester\n2. You show up to every class\n3. You go to office hours or email your TA when you're having trouble\n\nNow, I didn't graduate with a 4.0 because I lost rule #2 many times because that's unfortunately a huge character flaw in my early adult years. But anyway, trust me, MIT is not hard if you just do these three things. \n\nHope to hear an update on how you're going to MIT!",

As someone who got admitted to both, and as someone who has met people from both, in a way I learned going to MIT was 100% the correct decision for me.\n\nI've learned that the Stanford CS curriculum and culture do exactly what you're saying, it sets you up on how to get into startups and there's a *big* emphasis on it. Part of this I understood is because of Stanford's connections/proximity to Silicon Valley, so it's not surprising. As someone who wasn't entirely interested in startups, I'm glad I didn't go that route.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Right now, I'm not really looking into research, mostly industry.\n\nYeah, MIT could set you up for both. I did research in the Media Lab six out of eight semesters, and that's what really grew my resume. Through industry internships I figured out I didn't want to go into academia but I was very glad to have had the exposure to research.\n\n&gt;I'm worried about the course load at MIT, because from people I talked to it seemed like the course load is significantly large and students spend a lot of their time studying, at the very least much more than Stanford. \n\nI have heard anecdotal evidence of Stanford's famous [\"floating duck syndrome\"](https://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/focus-dont-be-duck-how-resist-stanford-duck-syndrome) which I figured this would be a thing at any reputable Ivy+ program, but the Stanford alums say it was a very real thing to be quietly drowning in work. MIT culturally has gone through great lengths to normalize talking about being stressed about work and actually scaling down courseload if you think you've done too much. To your point about not having worked hard in high school, that's pretty typical of a lot of incoming MIT students (very much \"big fish in small pond\" effect). A lot of students are quickly humbled in their first semesters but adapt quickly.\n\nMIT used to glorify being burned out and taking a million classes and not sleeping, it's true. But since my time there, that culture has changed a lot. MIT is a choose-your-own-adventure pressure cooker, so it can be as hard or as difficult as you want it to be. There was one semester I went from taking the hardest classes of my career to then taking three humanities classes and having a three day class week, so that I could job hunt / do research / write my \"thesis\". \n\nOther comments seem to point out the no-brainer of MIT being cheaper, which I agree with, but I wanted to more address your subjective concerns.",

I take that to mean you're intrinsically curious rather than caring about how other people view you, yet you might feel this internalized / external pressure to prove your worth to people. I also think what you have right now is perfectly fine and probably healthier in the long run. You will have achieved \"ambition\" in other people's eyes, whatever that means, before you know it, because your natural interest and intellect will drive you to pursue things like challenging classes, cool research, etc.\n4. That might also be the reason you vibe with MIT culture more. Granted, it may have changed, but when I attended (before Covid) I would say people are more down-to-earth while being extremely smart and hard-working. So rather than trying to one-up each other you have these very smart people collaborate and cheer each other on.\n\nThat said I will also mention some cons about MIT to give you some info. I think the biggest qualm with MIT is that people normalize burnout culture. Because like I said, people are very hard-working, you have people coming into class with 4 hours of sleep and other people being like \"lucky you, I only got 1.5\". I operated on this mode feeling like sleeping is wasting time, until I realized how unproductive I was by being burnt out and eventually depressed. But as long as you realized this and prioritize self-care over psets and exams, you will be ok.",

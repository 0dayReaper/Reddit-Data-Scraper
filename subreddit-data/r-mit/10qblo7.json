This treatment comes at no cost to you. *You must be over 18 years old and live in Massachusetts to participate*.\u00a0\n\nThis study is testing a new smartphone app-delivered treatment for people who are feeling depressed. The treatment is called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Participants will receive access to the app as well as support from a CBT therapist through brief, weekly virtual appointments all at no cost. CBT helps people learn new skills to reduce unhelpful thoughts and behaviors, and improve their mood. We hope that this new smartphone-delivered treatment will help make CBT more accessible for all!\u00a0\n\nFor more information visit our website: [https://mddstudy-mgh.koahealth.com/](https://mddstudy-mgh.koahealth.com/)\n\nEmail:[depressiontreatmentstudy@partners.org](mailto:depressiontreatmentstudy@partners.org)\n\nPhone: (617)-724-4354\n\nInstitution: Massachusetts General Hospital\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Sabine Wilhelm",

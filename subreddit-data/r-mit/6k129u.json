I think the #1 dorm had 5% fail to graduate in 6 years, the #11 dorm (EC or Random) had 10% fail to graduate in 6 years, and the #12 dorm (Senior Haus) had.... 20% fail to graduate in 6 years.\n\nI'm a little irritated at this point at the \"journalism\" around this. There are genuine student complaints here, and I am tired of MIT constantly attempting to destroy the unique student culture on campus. But handwaving away the genuine issues that Senior Haus had (along with acting as though EC+Random _aren't_ full of queer, low-income, minority students in open and supportive environments) is _really_ rubbing me the wrong way.",

There are dorms that have more URMs, more women, more queer folk, more low-income students (in fact, Random has more on two of those axes, though one of those is only very slightly more). So I'm still seeing the 10% to 20% drop in 6-year grad rates as being not-totally-justified by the disadvantaged group argument.\n\nI'm curious if anyone is reading the data differently.",

(1) It seems the measure of \"diversity\" would be \"distance from the origin\", which is cropped off here (in such a way that makes Senior Haus look relatively farther from it than it is). (2) It leaves out data about gender and income level - particularly odd since income level is the single largest predictor of SAT scores.\n\nBut even so, the distance between McCormick and East Campus is _huge_, and the 6-year dropout rate difference is 5%. The distance between East Campus and Senior Haus is much smaller, and the difference in dropout rate is 10%.\n\nAs I said before, the differences aren't totally justified by the disadvantaged group argument. I'm not trying to say that SH is full of rich straight white dudes, but I am saying that it's clear to me that there have to be significant other issues going on.",

The point of the original graph is to compare vs. Institute averages. On an absolute scale Senior House is just absurdly far from the origin.\n\nAnd not to beat a dead horse that has been discussed several times, but race is actually a [much stronger predictor](http://www.cshe.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/shared/publications/docs/ROPS.CSHE_.10.15.Geiser.RaceSAT.10.26.2015.pdf) of SAT scores than income, so much so that most analyses of SAT scores segregate results by racial category to better understand other correlations. The reasons for this are of course incredibly complicated and could fill up their own subreddit with discussions.\n\nThere are almost certainly other factors at play in Senior House. Drugs are often cited as a culprit but the administration is not disclosing any data around drug use. Regardless, no one fighting to save Senior House is defending the drug use or drug culture, so it's a bit of a strawman argument. Everyone agrees the Institute should be taking steps against drug use in the house. But they don't have to depopulate the dorm to do it.\n\nEDITED to include much more recent study on race vs. class and SAT scores, and to fix my dumb link.",

There are rumors flying around about a few students attempting to sell cocaine, but it seems most people directly involved with all this want privacy, and there are even a few students speaking out about certain damaging aspects of Senior Haus culture.\n\n&gt; Everyone agrees the Institute should be taking steps against drug use in the house. But they don't have to depopulate the dorm to it.\n\nI've probably beaten the dead horse of diversity enough already, so I'll get back to focusing on the actual issue at hand. I totally agree with you that the Institute shouldn't be depopulating the dorm. Students who were \"in\" on whatever major event occurred should perhaps be removed, but the rest should be allowed back in. It's absolutely _ridiculous_ that one needs a _professor's recommendation_ to get back into their dorm - I don't think I even really professors very well until senior year.\n\nIt's clear that there are changes that need to be made. Apparently Senior Haus has been working on this in the past year, but not enough was done -- if my impression of the situation is correct, I actually don't blame the administration for deciding to step in. But I totally blame them for deciding to go nuclear here. That's fucked up.",

I was trying to tell a long arc, which meant I needed historical voices, too. In terms of Senior House residents quoted, there were three alums (one who graduated last year) and two current students.\n\nThe students were generally worried about continuing COD proceedings re: current house members.\n",

That's because he didn't do his research about the problems at the school.\n\nWith his statement he emboldened the misfits and troublemakers, the school had to react to show it's in control and that law and order rule the world.\n\nTypical stupid Apple, leaping without looking or perhaps this was some sort of recruiting effort? After all Apple is appearing not to be entering the autonomous car market with a vehicle, only with software. Without hardware sales Apple is dead as a company.\n\nSo perhaps the school and Tim Cook are in co-hoots with each other, to get the misfits to work at Apple and bring them new ideas for hardware products.\n\nMIT gets rid of their problem and Apple inherits them choosing whom will make the next new gadget craze. Anyone with a brain knows to go work for Google or Tesla and not for the paranoid control freaks at Apple.\n",

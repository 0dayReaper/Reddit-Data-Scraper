((And also trusting that many things one learns are like riding a bicycle: easy to pick back up if you have to after you've \"forgotten\"))\n\nIf you play an instrument then you'll be familiar with muscle memory whereby whole complicated groups of muscle movements feel like one.  It's less to understand that way.  A more literal example from math: if I tell you about a polynomial (x^2 -4x+4) you feel understanding without having to import into your brain the add-and-carry algorithms for addition of numerals that long ago in gradeschool felt complicated; without even graphing it out you intuit that it looks like a bowl shape with some minimum (you know how important that ^2 is and know to look past the other clutter); and maybe you also patternmatch that the expression factors as an exact square etc etc.\n\nSo when we digest material from a class one of our jobs is to  find abstractions and viewpoints and patterns that make sense to us personally, and to do this \"compression\" recursively.",

            "comment": "Few different ways i found to stay ahead of the game. \n\n- **Read the material before lecture.** Repetitive learning played a HUGE role for me when i was in difficult classes. Skim the notes to be covered that day in each class the day of or the night before. Take 15mins/class if you don't think you have enough time. total of an hour total, but you won't be shocked when you then go to class and you can focus on listening to the explanations than understanding the notes etc since you've already \"seen\" them. \n\n- **Start your p-sets early.** As soon as you turn in one p-set, the next is generally posted online. Read through every problem and get an idea for what is asked. Sometimes professors will go through similar problems in class and if you ask questions specifically related to the p-set, you'll be surprised that they know what you're asking and will likely answer in a VERY helpful manner because they know you're taking the initiative and not waiting until the last second to do your HW. When you sit down to do your p-set, write down all of your variables, equations you know etc, and try the problems yourself BEFORE YOU WORK WITH A GROUP. This will help you with imposter syndrome and frankly you'll learn to cope with the problems on your own as you will be expected to do in an exam/real life. \n\n- **Go to office hours after you have done the above.** If you show up to office hours after doing the above, you'll be far less likely to show up looking for answers to problems, and more likely to understand how to actually solve the problems. Also profs/TA's can tell who has actually put effort into their homework beforehand and who is just showing up looking for an answer. \n\n- **A lot of stress at MIT is self-inflicted.** It's ok to not understand something, or a lot of something. It happens to everyone. Part of this experience is to teach you to be resourceful, learn, and adapt to challenging problems. You came to this school for this experience because MIT supposedly trains the best engineers. This is what it takes, so understand it's meant to be difficult and challenging on purpose! Take a deep breath when you're feeling overwhelmed. Go for a quick 30 minute walk. Always get sleep. All-nighters are almost always unnecessary, because you fall behind on sleep and work in the future. \n\nGood luck, you're doing great, and feel free to ask more questions if you have em'.",

It's not something some people have and others don't. Gaming generally implies manipulating a system. This is just staying on top of things and being proactive. Gaming would be something like copying p-sets and memorizing exam problems without really learning the material. \n\nMany kids who come to MIT coasted or at least moderately applied themselves through high school and are blindsided by not knowing how to properly study when at MIT. It's just a matter of swallowing your pride and putting in the effort to try and change your habits.",

It will start to feel like a lot, but I think it pays off in the long run.\n\nAlso, I think the firehose feeling is by design. Humans learn best by immersion, and it may feel overwhelming, but just take it one step at a time, and go as fast as you can go. Feeling stressed out all the time or overwhelmed with work is no way to live. But if you just take it one step at a time, I think it's manageable. Still trying to figure this out as well :/",

Don\u2019t get me wrong - it\u2019s hard, but I found this helped me organize my thoughts better\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about remembering specific techniques for every class in the future, you don\u2019t need to. The idea isn\u2019t to remember every technique you\u2019ve ever used forever, but rather that you can look back at your notes or read the Wikipedia page on the topic when it becomes important to you and actually understand it. A specific mathematical technique you used freshman year and then never again might not be fresh in your mind senior year, but that\u2019s okay because you can look it back up and recall it",

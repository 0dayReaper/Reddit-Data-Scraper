While I have read and understood all 5 papers, I cannot understand how to start the summary and what\u2019s important. If anyone can help with a template or any resource on how to get started, it will go a long way. Thanks in advance. I don\u2019t want to waste my IAP in Jan in taking the writing workshop\ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72",

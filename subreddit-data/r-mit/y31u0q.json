IIRC it lived in a garage in the area for a few years; I vaguely remember seeing an email or post in a caltech or mit group asking if anyone wanted to take it from there, and I thought maybe it was carted back to socal, but I can find no records of that.",

Info can be found here: http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2021/barber70/\n\nA personal favorite is the Twosday hack, for which students put a giant 2 on little dome and smaller 2s on the alchemist during the Ultimate Twosday (2/22/22, which was in fact a Tuesday). If you are actively intersted in getting photos, I can send some over!\n\nThere was another hack just a couple days ago which was among a few hacks criticizing the closed campus policy. Again, I can send photos, and discuss a few more hacks if you're interested!\n\nThat's just a few I liked in the past year.",

It's a stupid cycle that encourages students to get into serious trouble basically. \n\nIt's basically impossible now to get on top of big dome. Little dome too is incredibly hard to get on top of now all of the doors are alarmed. Not worth it imho. Too many serious repercussions because lawyers are king at the institute now.",

Culture always changes, but I think in at least some ways it has very much changed for the better. I'm also very optimistic for the cultures of especially some EC halls surviving, given how some parts of BC seem very much culturally alive and well from what I've heard!\n\nThat's just my (potentially optimistic) take though. We'll see how things go in the coming years!",

Meanwhile, the last time I took physics was in 8th grade.\n\nIs this level of imposter syndrome normal? If MIT accepted me, is that enough validation that I will be able to get through? Will I be able to explore science fields I am a complete noob in?",

Just don\u2019t get a complex about having to try really hard in the \u201cbasic\u201d classes. Stay humble, catch up, do cool things.",

What you quickly realize is that many kids had different opportunities coming from so many different schools. You now have access to the same opportunities everyone else has at MIT. Make of that what you will. I'm often amazed at how little correlation there is between success in high school and success at MIT. Be the best you can be and don't measure yourself to others, because they're often just as worried/flawed as you are.",

I think the most important factors in your success (esp if you're a kid who's from bumblefuck vs from TJ/Stuyvesant, or who's worried about your preparation) are taking a reasonable course load, staying motivated and not getting discouraged when you struggle/take classes with people who're ahead of you, staying on top of your mental health (this was BY FAR the hardest part of MIT for me), and being willing to reach out for help. \n\nYou don't have to take 11 classes/semester and max yourself out on activities. I know many people who had near 5.0s and they weren't all \"the best\" or hyperprepared IMO kids, just people who took reasonable course loads, worked hard, and were willing to ask for help when they needed to.",

It\u2019s hard to feel good about yourself when you walk into a school filled with thousands as amazing as you, especially when you were the best your whole life. \n\nYou should realize that the fact that you got into MIT sure as hell means you\u2019re good enough. You\u2019re definitely good enough, because you were better than 92.8% of the some of the smartest people your age in the world, and that\u2019s incredible. \n\nPeoples stories will *sound* amazing and impressive compared to yours, but that\u2019s just an illusion caused by impostor syndrome.\n\nThroughout your years of schooling you\u2019ve always been the best, and you might not be anymore when you go to MIT. However, it\u2019s extremely important not to lose sight of the fact that you got into one of the best and most competitive schools on earth, that all your work during the last five years has paid off, you have achieved something great, and you really really are good enough.\n\nGo celebrate!",

But it evened itself out very quickly. I was taking the same classes as my classmates by Sophomore year, ahead in some areas, and behind in others. \n\nMIT knows what success looks like, and you matched it. Believe them.",

            "comment": "yes to exploring new fields! MIT is attempting to make the first year an equalizer in adding discovery courses and other exploratory opportunities to break out of what you were good at in hs and possibly build yourself up in a different field if you so wish. You got admitted to the institute, not a specific major, and that\u2019s the beauty and fluidity of it all! I know a math major who barely took beyond Calc in high school and didn\u2019t do competitions but is still thriving here. I also didn\u2019t do research competitions in high school until AFTER I got into MIT, so I wasn\u2019t necessarily in well-acronymed company until well after my application was already processed and accepted.\n\nThe general undergrad culture is knowing that everyone has their \u201cblind spots\u201d but helping where we can (re: I love designing and building stuff, but hate the required math and physics stuff and I\u2019m getting help for it. yet my bf was a physics camp nerd now doing econ, but don\u2019t ask him to build a t-shirt launcher like I am currently.) and I think it\u2019s pretty awesome how much mingling there is between upperclassmen and underclassmen and people of all majors, so you can get advice and experience from a diversity of people rather than just \u201cthe freshman dorm\u201d or \u201cthe engineering school\u201d.",

Just relax and try to enjoy it, find things that you are passionate about and do them, dont try to take too many credits at once, be humble, dont compete for who slept less, try to make friends and work with them on psets (this might be a large part of your human interaction) try to do research with some profs, join some clubs, hell take 5 years to get a 4 year degree, its some of the best years of your life and you will miss them when you are gone. (And they will be painful while you are there) \n\nBut overall remember to have perspective, if you feel overwhelmed drop a class, in 10 years nobody is going to care you got a C in algorithms but the fact you were a nervous wreck through college because you didnt have perspective will have an impact on you during your time there.\n\nBe cool and enjoy it man/woman, wish I could do it all over again",

For us to think that 10 differnet people could unanimously make a mistake was impossible, and we should know that we were specifically chosen out of thousands to be here.\n\nSo yeah, you deserve it!

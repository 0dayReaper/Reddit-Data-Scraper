    "postText": "Hi hi! I\u2019m off to do an internship in Atlanta so won\u2019t be in Boston this summer. I\u2019m subletting a really nice bedroom in a 3-bed-1-bath apartment on Aberdeen Street (next to Fenway Park) with flexible rent (around $1500, but negotiable) from mid-May to end of August. \n\nIt\u2019s 4 minutes walking to Fenway Target, Star Market, Sephora, etc and a 5 min train ride away from the Coolidge Corner Trader Joe\u2019s :) There are 2 Green Line stations (Fenway + Saint Mary\u2019s Street) 3-minute walk away and multiple bus stops. \n\nThe bedroom has 2 windows and will be fully + newly furnished, with in-building laundry. DM me for pictures and more information!!\n\nP/S: pretty sure my roommates are trying to rent out their rooms for the summer too, so let me know if you are looking to rent with your friends for those months :)",

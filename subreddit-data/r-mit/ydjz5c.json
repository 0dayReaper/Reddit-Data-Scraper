    "postText": "Does it really bother anyone else that we have a pretty lacking Electrical Engineering curriculum here? I mean the past 2 years alone, around half of the Graduate-level electrical engineering courses I planned on taking since I got here were cancelled due to professors leaving or starting a sabbatical (6.776, 6.161, 6.375, etc).\n\nMakes me feel like I chose the wrong university, especially when I'm interested in VLSI or analog / mixed-signal circuit design and we offer no course which tapes out a chip or even really prepares us to, where I've now had several interviews with people in industry who are shocked that our curriculum is not at the caliber of Stanford or UC-Berkley.\n\nIt's a little disconcerting getting through an advanced EE degree without even having access to a proper controls course, RF circuits, or even an advanced analog circuit design course in general that has exposure to concepts that I cannot just learn from a textbook or just screwing around with a Cadence license (6.775, 6.374, 6.302).\n\nIt makes me really believe I've simply wasted my time here, especially when every attempt at doing research has hit a dead end from losing funding, while I see people around me swing a CSAIL RA-ship to fund their degree doing yet another project of slapping ML on an already-proven concept and publishing.\n\nThat's not to say there aren't people within the department fighting to keep it alive. Steinmeyer's contributions to 6.111 and 6.08 and Leeb's 6.115 and 6.131 have to be the highlight of my academic experience here. But to be honest, I would consider most EE classes past that are very lackluster.\n\nWas this department ever better than this? Or am I simply witnessing its death?",

            "comment": "I have observed this as well. It's due to a few reasons. The EECS department focuses funding on where grant money flows in and where student demand is. CS just plain more lucrative, from a financial standpoint, than EE is. Industry pays more to CS grads, and funding agencies give lots more money to CS/ML research because it has faster tangible returns and is hyped up right now. Even a lot of EE research now is just applying ML to *insert problem*. I don't have any solutions for you other than making admin more aware of this problem (although they already are, but making a fuss about it is more likely to change things). I don't think this problem is unique to MIT either. From my knowledge, even though other top schools you mentioned might have more available EE courses I think they have similar problems in terms of funding and enrollment. Another problem here is a lot of the EE faculty are old dinosaurs that should have retired already, and since the department prioritizes hiring CS over EE profs you get more profs taking sabbaticals and not designing new EE electives and such instead of getting new blood to shake things up.\n\nAlso, please post this to the Course 6 piazza (dm for link if you don't have it yet). I think discourse there would be very useful and admins actually read posts there.",

Fantastic class on Bayesian Inference and Modeling, Id call it nearly a \"must take\" for anyone going in that direction. 6.231 on the reinforcement learning side of things only really overlaps with 036 on basic Q learning. The math department has some great classes too, like Strang's. I think the popular conception of ML just obscures that it's largely a repackaging of richer fields from dynamic programming to variational calculus and statistical modeling. We definitely have a solid curriculum on those underlying fields, and taking them will likely serve someone better than just a handbook of currently popular models",

Most of the important header classes like 6.012, 6.011 and 6.013 are only offered in Spring, leaving only advanced classes or lab classes for those interested in EE (which prompted me to currently take 6.301). 6.01 got killed and it seems like it will never be offered again; and with the current change eliminating intro classes I wonder if 6.02 and 6.08 will go the same route.\n\nI search up for EE classes in the curriculum and it always seems like you are forced to take grad classes to advance your knowledge, or you are confined to the limited 1 or 2 intro classes that introduce you to a subject.",

So it seems like they\u2019re trying to just kill off the major. In fact, at the initial associate advisor meeting the department heads of course 6 explicitly said that people interested in EE should do the new 6-2. I understand that EECS is moving in a new direction but there will always be a need for 6-1 people to actually build the circuits for the rest of course 6.",

            "comment": "I hear you OP and others, and I'm sorry that we've had to cancel several of our more advanced circuits classes recently due to a combination of leaves &amp; sabbaticals. Some of the classes you list are coming up again: 6.374 is being offered this term, 6.161 will be offered next term. But yeah, it's been kind of a perfect storm on the circuits side, and you're only here a limited time, so I get it.\r  \n\r  \nBut let me say this loudly: we love EE. In fact, we've been working like crazy, the EE faculty collectively, to create a new EE curriculum (the new 6-2) and revise or introduce over 20 classes. Here are some things you might be interested in:\r  \n\r  \nQuantum systems engineering: we have a new track in this area, one class (6.2400) being piloted this Fall, and a lab class being piloted in Spring. This is quantum **engineering**, not quantum physics. \r  \n\r  \nEnergy: another poster raised the point that we need more classes on energy. Yup! We are piloting a new class in this area in Spring (6.2200). It's a full stack view of the field, from energy transduction to the power grid. And we've just hired a new faculty member in this area, so expect more classes soon.\r  \n\r  \nWanna go down the stack? How about the new 6.2540, where you go and fabricate nanodevices. Or the newly revised 6.152/6.2600, which is a top-down fab class, with a project of your own choosing at the end.\r  \n\r  \nI know 6.161 is being moved to spring, but that's because we are introducing a new Silicon Photonics class this Fall (6.S046). Want to learn how to sense or compute with light? Both theory and hands-on? Check it out. We are also piloting a computational imaging class (6.S045), mixing optics with computation to design new imaging systems.\r  \n\r  \nOn the biomedical side, we have a new Biomedical Systems class (6.4800) coming in Spring, descended from 6.03, but at a more sophisticated level. \r  \n\r  \nAnd in spring also comes 6.9000 Engineering for Impact, where we'll design full-stack (and I mean really full-stack) systems: sensors, electronics, compute. Focused on a societal need. Should be fun.\r  \n\r  \nAnd yes, we want tapeout too! We are introducing a new junior level active devices course (6.2080), that, along wiht 6.301/6.2090 will introduce an analog tapeout. The hard part about tapeout is that we don't just want to ship a design. We want to get the silicon back and test it. And fab runs take time, so hard to fit into a semester. So we're splitting that experience across these two classes.\r  \n\r  \nOn the digital side, we're also thinking about how to get tapeouts. 6.374 is now using the Skywater PDK along with Cadence.\r  \n\r  \nAnd don't forget about 6.334: it's not integrated circuits, but the class is fantastic, and there's no one better to learn power electronics from than Dave Perreault.\r  \n\r  \nOP, if your academic advisor isn't familiar with all these new/revised classes, I'd be happy to give some advice, just DM me and we can meet up.\r  \n\r  \nSo we've been busy, and we hope you like what we've been planning.\r  \n\r  \nBut please, keep up the unfiltered feedback. We can always do better. Keep us honest. \r  \n\r  \nWe love EE!",

                    "comment": "I once told my academic advisor when I was still in the program that I didn't feel like I was learning anything, that there was no classes within my focus area and that I didn't feel my progress, education and professional development was at a similar level to those in similar programs that I had met through research. I went to him because i didnt know what to do to get back on track. He told me that I should 'seriously consider dropping out'. I elevated this to the department and effectively got told the same thing.\nMaybe the department is finally pulling its shit together but in my view it's been dead for a long time and theres little interest to change, just words. Until the EE department proves me wrong my advice to anyone thinking about MIT EE is to seriously consider your other options as your educational and post academia opportunities might very well exceed what MIT can deliver.",

I'm now on the other side, working full-time in EE (analog and mixed-signal VLSI) and doing college recruiting at MIT. Everything you're saying appears true to me. Honestly, at this point, I'd put the UMich curriculum above MIT.",

            "comment": "6-1 BS 07 (one of eight that year), MEng 11, PhD 16, and postoc until about 2018 here - I, too, absolutely loved 6.115 and 6.131, and I'd argue that most of what I do for a living is based on these classes.  I may show my age with some of these suggestions, and I hope I don't sound like I'm ranting.\n\nI spent the majority of my time at MIT in LEES (now RLE) down in 10-050 doing electric machinery.  If you're interested, take 6.685/6.690 (Kirtley's electric machinery/power systems) and 6.334 (Perreault's power electronics).  Electric machinery is mostly field theory mixed with a bunch of spatial concepts.  6.334 touches on control concepts and lots of basic electronics, as well as some pretty cool math to solve odd problems (that may have been Perreault's advanced power electronics class).  In any case, people seem to care much more about electric machinery again now that robotics and cars (even aircraft) are in search of ever-increasing power density and efficiency.  My thesis project was the motors in Sangbae Kim's cheetah, and I've had several projects in the real world related to clever cramming of power into smaller and smaller spaces.\n\nIf you're looking for controls and are a masochist in the linear algebra sense, check out Megretski's 6.241.  You'll learn more than you knew there was to know about state-space models and different types of stability.  I sucked at this at the time.  Ten years later, I seriously appreciate it.\n\n6.631 (Fujimoto's optics and photonics) was also really good.\n\nAll of the aforementioned classes are weed-out classes for their respective labs.  They're not to be taken lightly.\n\n6.302 used to be awesome when Roberge taught it.  I don't know who has it now, but you're 15 years late for him.\n\nIf you didn't do it as an undergrad, take 8.03.  Then again, I caught Lewin in his prime for this one.\n\n*Now that I look at my list, I might agree with you - a lot of these guys have left or quit teaching and I'm not sure they've been replaced.*\n\nIf you're interested in VLSI stuff, make sure you've brushed up on all your thermal stuff.  2.005 with Brisson was one of the more useful classes I took.  It can mostly be reduced to lumped parameter models which should look very familiar to you, but it's useful to think about that math in terms of heat, especially as thermal considerations increasingly dominate performance of devices.  (My minor for my PhD was MechE, though I'm not sure you're still required to have a minor.)\n\nI will say though - the basics apply to all of this.  It took me a long time to realize that the math is all the same and connected.  8.03 is the base, and pretty much anything you ever wanted to do can be done with that and an understanding of linear algebra (not the 18.06 type, but real linear algebra, which Strang also does *very* well).  Controls especially.  I almost think that 8.03 could have been taught before or in place of 18.03.\n\nAnd the ML comments above - you can certainly do a lot of cool stuff there.  I think you'll find that a good understanding of the basics can be used to reduce problems to something more tractable, that you can then set the ML and other brute-force approaches on more effectively.  I used to say, \"He who said brute force didn't work wasn't using enough.\"  Now I'm a big proponent of expanding the search area to fit the amount of brute force available.\n\nI keep coming back to this - What MIT does really well is hammer in the fundamentals.  We suck at providing context, both in why you're learning things, how it's applicable, and separately all the other stuff that contributes to mental health.  You can learn individual, specialized things, but you'll find that a solid base will get you through damn near anything, and it'll probably take you a while to realize just how flexible and applicable all these things really are.  I really hope this approach doesn't die as brute-force methods become more powerful - they complement each other.",

            "comment": "EE at MIT is so completly devoid of any insights or standard practices outside its own little academic bubble. Classes dropped left and right and new ones pop up that, sure, might be interesting but don't really do anything to advance your professional development or research. I did my research in optoelectronics and literally had to teach everything myself because there was never a class taught for the subject. There's still some some solid state phenomenon that I still don't fully understand even after graduating. Take a physics class you say? Well the department doesn't accept those toward your degree and every department makes every class overly hard for no reason. So either come into the program with all the knowledge you'll ever need or don't do a thesis that requires physical experiments because you can't accomplish both. How about learn on the job after? What they don't tell you is there is basically no semiconductor industry in the U.S. period. The average engineer is over 50. The people getting hired are from schools with feeder programs like Stanford, Berkeley and UofA not MIT - because MIT doesn't reinforce or teach anything relevant. Do yourself a favor and switch to CS.",

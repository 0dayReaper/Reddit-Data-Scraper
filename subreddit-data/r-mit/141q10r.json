    "postText": "Wondering if anyone has experience with 8.03 substitutions for course 8 requirements; I didn't want to take it since I've heard it's basically 18.03 but for physicists. My primary major is 18.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the input everyone. I see 8.03 is distinct from 18.03 but I'm still wondering if there's a reasonable substitute (ex. an 18.3xx class that focuses on waves), or if I should just take or ASE 8.03.",

            "comment": "I don't think you can substitute 8.03 for any other class other than perhaps an equivalent course from other universities (Idk the policies for such thing) for an 8 major. I am planning on taking it or ASE-ing it (we'll see if I pull together the motivation this summer), but from what I have seen, 18.03 is used, but it is not just that.. it is a class on vibrations and waves, and so it will primarily cover physics concepts and even a little quantum physics. You should take a look at the concepts on OCW to see. I think you should just take the class since it is an important class for people involved in physics in some way.",

            "comment": "8.03 was tough (I took it Freshman Spring when MIT had Freshman Pass/No Record for the year). They used to make the Spring semester especially tough \u2014 used to be the advanced Freshmen or Aero/Astro majors.\n\nIt is 18.03 applied to Physics, as in Fourier Transforms and harmonic motion, but there\u2019s a bit more (wave guides and boundary conditions, differential forms of Maxwell\u2019s Equations). If you\u2019ve done 18.02 and 18.03, you should be pretty good.\n\nI was happy with my high C (= recorded as Pass).",

            "comment": "I took 8.03 and 18.03 both within the past year and they are not the same at all. 8.03 is physics and while it does involve solving diff eq, its focus is learning about oscillators. 18.03 was learning how to solve diff eqs and while some of that was oscillator stuff, it focused on how to solve the things, not what they meant. I don\u2019t think that they have anywhere near enough overlap to be substitutable and most people who are taking 8.03 have taken or will take 18.03 separate. \n\nDM me if you wan more specific info/have more follow up questions",

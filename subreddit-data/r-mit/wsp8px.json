    "postText": "Hi, I'm really struggling to choose between the new revised 6-2 compared to 6-3. I feel like 6-2 would not necessarily provide me the programming skills that I need by only requiring me to take two programming classes. It's a very EE heavy course at this point. What do y'all think about the comparison between these two after the revision?",

If you declare 6-2 but end up taking more courses that fulfill 6-3 requirements than 6-2, you\u2019re free to switch to 6-3 anytime.\n\nBut yeah, the 2017 version of 6-2 is way more flexible, so you can take it if it\u2019s available to you.",

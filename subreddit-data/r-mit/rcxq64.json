The sign language gloves have been done to death, so much so that [there's even a meme about it](https://twitter.com/DeafmemesExe/status/1463909636994654211). This wouldn't even be an improvement on the usual method of how most D/deaf folks communicate with hearing people (Using a paper/pen and/or typing stuff out on a phone to show to the hearing person) as it asks the user to sign *ridiculously* slow. It'd be like asking a hearing person to speak at 1 word a second. \n\nFurthermore, it just perpuates the idea that anyone who's D/deaf or HoH must accommodate the hearing person. \n\nI'm disappointed by this.",

My deaf friends, if they want to communicate with a hearing person, just write a note.\n\nAlso, what about the hearing person communicating back? Lip-reading is a useful tool, but even the best lip-readers have limited accuracy.\n\nCool tech or whatever. I don't think it solves a real problem. I've seen variations of this idea for *years*, and the reason they haven't stuck is because it's not solving the right problem and NOT because the tech is insufficiently advanced.",

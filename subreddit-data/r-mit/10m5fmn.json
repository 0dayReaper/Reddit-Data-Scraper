    "postText": "I am planning my course schedule for the following years with IAP ending and wanted to know if 6.UAT is a lot of work (homeworkwise and just generally other stuff attached to the class). Generally, I have seen a lot of hate for the course on this thread. What makes it so bad? Also, what do you actually do in the class? \n\nThanks in advance--wishing all love as we enter Spring 2023 :)",

It turns programmers who couldn't explain programming to other programmers if their life depended on it into fairly competent public speakers. (I'm not exaggerating). And I don't recall it being that much work.",

There's a few out-of-classroom requirements, but there's many options so if you plan in advance you won't be overwhelmed.\n\nIf you're catastrophically afraid of public speaking, you will not have a good time",

There's some frontloaded work with the 3 workshops you have to attend outside of class hours but it's generally something you really only have to think about every other week in terms of presentations. I will say unfortunately, whether it's smooth sailing or painful is heavily dependent on your TA and RI and how nice they are with grading. I had a great pair so YMMV.",

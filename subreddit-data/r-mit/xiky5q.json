    "postText": "I am not from the MIT or the USA, I study in the Netherlands. I need an old PhD thesis from 1969 to do research for my own thesis. There are only hard copies (at the MIT library) but according to this [link](https://libraries.mit.edu/distinctive-collections/imaging-services/), it is free for MIT students to request the MIT library to scan it. It would cost me, as a non MIT person, 45$, which I cannot afford. The document can be found [here](https://mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma990005517310106761&amp;context=L&amp;vid=01MIT_INST:MIT&amp;lang=en&amp;search_scope=MIT_theses&amp;adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&amp;tab=all&amp;query=any,contains,An%20Analytical%20Investigation%20of%20Air%20Traffic%20in%20the%20Vicinity%20of%20Terminal%20Areas,AND&amp;mode=advanced&amp;offset=0). I'd appreciate it if someone is willing to make the request.",

That's rough though, 700 pages just to conclude that the target result is basically because of cheating, haha. Right up there with \"finding out at your thesis defense that some paper from 1972 covers your entire dissertation topic already\".",

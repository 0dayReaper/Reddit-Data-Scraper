    "postText": "I am a freshman majoring in 6-2 and I was courseroading and wanted to know what the difference is between Intro to Machine Learning (6.3900/6.036) and Machine Learning (6.7900/6.867) . Their descriptions are similar and they have the same number of units, so should I take one over the other if I am hoping to gain some experience in machine learning?",

            "comment": "7900 is a grad class, so there's an assumption of familiarity. On student.mit.edu/catalog it also recommends 3900 as a pre-req.\n\nMany grad classes don't officially list undergrad classes as pre-reqs because they're for grad students who wouldn't need to take the intro undergrad class to do well.\n\nThat said, if you think you can skip over 3900, you can always make that argument to your advisor and go straight into 7900.",

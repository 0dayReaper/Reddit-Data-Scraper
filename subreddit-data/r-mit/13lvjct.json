MIT can't just give in - well, I suppose they can, but they wont, because, if the Administration is to be believed, the Union pay proposal is financially ruinous and MIT's commitment to an open shop is (to them) not negotiable. The union has said they won't budge, so since there's no contract then MIT's current employment terms (pay, benefits) are \"frozen\" for union members as long as negotiations are at a standstill. It's not MIT that's not moving, its both sides. MIT moved a lot from the beginning, but they are standing fast here. Pay increases are being implemented for non-union positions. This is how union negotiations work as I understand it. I think the Union ought to give on the open shop issue in exchange for more movement on pay rate and benefits myself, but I'm not a graduate student, just an interested third party.",

It\u2019s understandable why the union won\u2019t budge on the union shop - there\u2019s something like 3500 eligible members and only ~1800 that voted \u201cno\u201d on the contract (which includes non-eligible fellows) so that would be a massive loss in dues. Not to mention the possibility of the membership dwindling over time.\n\nI\u2019m sure MIT will increase their salary offer - not to 15%, but they\u2019ve been steadily raising it over the last few weeks. I suspect they\u2019ll eventually match GSC\u2019s cost of living analysis range of ~6-7%. But I don\u2019t see either side giving into the union shop issue.",

In their pre-vote emails, the Union and Admin gave different values for \u201cinflation\u201d.  If you look up how they got those numbers, in both cases they mean \u201ccost of living increase\u201d, but the Union gave their calculation based on the Boston area and an MIT student\u2019s distribution of expenses, while the Admin used a country-wide average based on all working adults.\n\n\nDon\u2019t take what the admins say at face value.  They don\u2019t have your best interests in mind (specifically they have your *worst* interests in mind, thats what this negotiation means).\n\n\n\nThat being said, I do think the Union is asking too much, but that too is part of the negotiation.

All the conditions you deal with are imposed to some degree -- if the terms we were bargaining for weren't imposed, then we would be asking for 100 grand. Before MITGSU, we had no contract. All of our terms were established without much student input, and there was very little anyone could do about it.\n\nThe power to not have provisions be imposed on us without our input rests solely on us having a strong union. Decisions (including contract votes) can only be enforced if there is there's sufficient power to enforce them. Unions try to counteract the power of bosses (who have asymmetric power over our working conditions because they control the money) through numbers -- what is the point of a contract that can't be enforced?\n\nA vote of thousands of people who aren't willing to say that they're willing to work with their fellow grad students to fight for better conditions is useless, because who will ensure that the contract will be enforced? Bosses (universities included) break contracts in a heartbeat.\n\nUnions aren't magical wish-fulfillment machines, they can't stop terms from being imposed on you. They simply give you a choice -- work together with your fellow workers to fight for better conditions, or sit on the sidelines.",

    "postText": "As an inbound first-year grad student whose program requires arrival at the end of May and is now looking for housing I assumed was sort of a given (clearly my fault), for what reason was the housing process NOT a lottery? I don't understand what necessitated the shift from lottery to direct selection. I don't understand what justifies it either. It's objectively unfair. \n\nHear me out. \n\nI, as I imagine many other inbound students do, work during the day. And yes, I can step out for a few minutes to fill out a form - but I can't step out for the multiple hours the process was taking when I tried logging in at 10. Even though I was fortunate enough to be able to log in at my work computer, my work computer is slower than molasses. Even if it wasn't, I doubt I would have had better luck because ANY time a major website opens at a set time, it crashes. And therein lies the problem - accessibility. If accessibility isn't equal, then there's no form of equitable assignments. \n\nIf you can't make a website that can take thousands of simultaneous inputs that will fairly reward those who apply early based on time and not bandwidth and luck, then just do what everyone does and make it a multi-round lottery to level the field. Submit your preferences and see what happens. I'd be much more okay with requesting through a lottery and getting screwed by a random number generator than getting screwed by poor design on the part of the organizer.\n\nDo better.\n\nTLDR: why shift from a lottery that allows everyone to put their name in the hat irrespective of time zone and commitment to a system that solely rewards those with the ability, access, and luck to get into a system within the first 10 minutes of it opening?",

The whole, choose your apartment, seems to be something that should be decided after you get assigned a building and unit type so you're not scrambling for whatever is available.",

    "postText": "I'm an incoming grad student from South Asia. What are the vegan/vegetarian options on campus? And what is the usual cost for a veg meal? I will be cooking my own meals most of the times, can other vegetarians give me a rough estimate on their monthly expenses on groceries? I see there was Vegan and vegetarian community at MIT but the web page is not updated after 2005, does this community still exist?",

The vegetarian options there were better than the meat options at other dorms. \n\nMaseeh has (or at least used to and still hopefully has) an Indian station which typically is a good place for vegetarian food. The Kosher station in maseeh is also good because if it has dairy it definitely doesn't have meat in it. \n\nA ton of my friends were vegetarian and vegan when I was on campus and never had any issues. \n\nThere are a lot of good purely vegetarian restaurants nearby too -\nVeggie Galaxy in Central, Life Alive in Central\n\nMost restaurants will have vegetarian options, the same with student events.\n\n There's a lot of different diets at MIT for both religious and personal reasons, and students do their best to be accommodating. My large club always had options for meat eating, no-pork, no-beef, pescatarian, vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, and a wide range of food allergies (shellfish, peanuts, some fruits).",

What should be my daily budget more a 2 time meal let\u2019s say.",

            "comment": "I want to put in a plug for cook for yourself dorms\u2014 usually dining halls have vegetarian options but sometimes they can be limited (for smaller dining balsa especially) and sometimes they just don\u2019t cook it right. I think if you\u2019re a stickler for worrying about contamination in prep, dining is going to be a headache for you, though I will say this is more of a serious problem in terms of an allergy than a dietary restriction. Sometimes foods are not labeled properly with contamination and stuff like that. To be very fair I think Maseeh is great with consistency and options since it\u2019s the biggest dining hall, so I def don\u2019t want to actively discourage you from getting a meal plan, but from my experience living at Next it\u2019s a bit harder. \n\nI live in a cfy dorm now and I think the extra flexibility I have is really nice. I\u2019m not vegetarian, I\u2019m pollopescatarian but a lot of my friends are veg/vegan, and I find that trading off the extra time needed to prep my meals for that extra flexibility to eat good food that we know what\u2019s in it is worth it. Also it\u2019s way less expensive, I\u2019d say my very loose food budget of $25/day is plenty for me to work with (it\u2019s high because I only cook dinner and breakfast, and buy lunch on campus and also order out a couple times a week to factor in laziness). \n\nCompared to the Block 225, which rounds out to $15/meal and I\u2019ve not heard of anyone at MIT what has actually finished their meal swipes just by eating them, it\u2019s also more economical and you get better food control and quality.",

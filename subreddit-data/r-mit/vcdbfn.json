Obviously, COVID and all makes my college experience a rather odd one as well plus I'm probably not your most typical person anyways. As long as you make an active and I do mean active effort to be social and meet people, you'll probably do okay. Academics wise people definitely have a hard time so don't be afraid to ask for help and also don't be afraid to drop responsibilities if you are overwhelmed. It's okay to not be okay and the first step of avoiding burnout and mental anguish is staying aware of how you feel and what around you affects your mood.",

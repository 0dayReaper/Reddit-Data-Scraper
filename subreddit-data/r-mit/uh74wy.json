    "postText": "Hi guys. So I managed to secure a unit during the grad housing selection process. I managed to sign the license agreement and downloaded a copy. But then, the website crashed and when I logged back into the housing portal, it says I hadn't signed the license agreement. When I tried opening the license agreement on the website itself, it said \"configuration error... contact administration office\" (or something along those lines). I tried contacting the grad housing people (our point of contact) via email but I didn't get a response.\n\nMy question is - Do I need to worry about losing my unit and paying a $250 penalty? Because I've signed the license agreement before the website crashed (and downloaded a copy, and it was also sent to my MIT email saying that I've signed) but on the website it says I haven't signed after the website crashed.\n\nIf it is a concern, who should I contact ASAP (because I only have until 5pm ET on Tuesday, 3rd May to finalise my choice)?\n\nPS: I too had troubles trying to secure a unit - was automatically logged out of my computer twice and refreshed the website far too many times. So, I also spare a thought for everyone who struggled with the housing selection process",

Maybe I'm just na\u00efve",

I just logged back in for today's Housing portal self-selection opening times (10am ET to 2pm ET) and my license agreement has been updated as signed. So, I think you can log back into the housing portal now and it should be updated and all good. If it still isn't, I'd suggest dropping into their zoom call [https://studentlife.mit.edu/contact-housing](https://studentlife.mit.edu/contact-housing) (under \"Drop-in Virtual Office Hours\" subsection from the link) at 3pm ET to 4pm ET. I hope everything works out for you as well :)",

I'll clear out my browser and try again tomorrow during the booking period, if it doesn't work I'll just email them my confirmation and they'll figure it out manually.\n\nHopefully this helps anyone in the same boat!",

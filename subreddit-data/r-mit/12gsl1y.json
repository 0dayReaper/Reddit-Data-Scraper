    "postText": "Help Choosing Between Stanford or MIT for undergrad computer science\n\nHello, I am an incoming undergraduate student hoping to study CS. I have the option between two great schools: MIT and Stanford. Both would cost me the same, so I am stuck on which one I should choose. I have visited both and talked with students there, and seem to have loved them equally. Is there any recommendations or pros and cons that anyone could mention about each school to help me make my decision? Thank you.",

The only con with MIT is it\u2019s rigorous and the weather sucks. Another pro is that you\u2019re right beside Harvard so it makes up for your network of Stanford being a larger school. MIT is also slightly (like an ounce) stronger in name in terms of computer science. \n\nAs for Stanford, the weather is better and you still have a great brand. However, Stanford only stands out if you\u2019re interested in start ups which you might with your degree, but start ups are starting to pop up everywhere and MIT being situated in Boston has a variety of industries. \n\nCan\u2019t go wrong with either one, congratulations on the success, the future is bright either way!",

And in general it\u2019s a good idea to consider what your overall lifestyle would be like.\n\nIn my case, I was able to play a varsity sport at MIT that I would have not been able to at Stanford.  That was a huge part of my MIT experience. I also had always wanted to learn Japanese, and with MISTI I was able to get two summer internships in Japan, just by taking the language courses and a couple culture courses and attending some easy training sessions.\n\nThose are just personal examples, but is there anything outside of pure academics you\u2019ve always wanted to do?  If so, would either school support that more than the other?",

            "comment": "Just to add my two cents: I'm a Stanford student with friends at MIT. What I've noticed is that the Stanford CS curriculum moves much faster than MIT's (I've gone from complete beginner to understanding low-level Assembly code and computability/complexity theory within my first year), mostly due to it being on the quarter system. However, at the same time, Stanford has much more grade inflation, which is what makes it gain the reputation of being easier compared to MIT. Depends on what you want there. Stanford's kind of miserable during the winter, but it's like heaven on earth in the spring. The competitive nature is there, though, and the Duck Syndrome is well and alive, which can really compound insecurities. If you have taken any classes at outside colleges or AP courses, going to Stanford will help because you can transfer those units easily. I started the year as a sophomore because I transferred 45 units in, which helps take a significant load off of your curriculum. The startup culture is pretty strong, with most people at least attempting to make a startup at some point in their Stanford journey, but like another commenter said, this sort of increases the competition between CS majors. Considering everything, I'm glad I went to Stanford, but MIT's an amazing school that I'm sure you would enjoy as well. Feel free to dm me for more info.",

If you see yourself taking any non-STEM classes during your college years, I think Stanford could be a compelling choice because we have pretty extensive humanities and social science departments as well.

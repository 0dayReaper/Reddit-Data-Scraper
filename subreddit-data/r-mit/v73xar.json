This policy is going to actively make it harder for folks to test for covid, which I just think is a bad idea altogether. Covid is still a thing, why not give students and faculty the option of testing whenever they want to?",

Since last year, new variants have arose (e.g. omega) which are way less lethal while being more contagious than covid wild type. Also way more people are vaccinated today than a year ago, and it has been shown that being vaccinated results in less severe symptoms. Therefore, I wouldn't go as far as attributing the ratio difference to better and quicker response, even though it might have played a role. However, this data does objectively show that covid is still around. People still get sick, even though maybe less severely so. So, why make it harder for people to test, it just doesn't make sense.",

I know that Cecelia is not worried about long COVID, but I don't think we have enough information to make that call--and the firehose culture of MIT is the last place where you want people to suddenly get tired or foggy-headed after only a few hours of work. \n\nI've been taking the tests regularly. The new variants of COVID do strike faster than the first ones that circulated, but it's still possible to get COVID and not know it--especially now that it's allergy season. And I'd rather learn that I've got COVID *before* it makes its presence known. \n\nI thought MIT was wrong to bring us back to campus so soon, and I definitely think that this is the wrong decision too.",

It would have been more reasonable to at least monitor the spread through testing (especially given how contagious the new strains are), and I don\u2019t see how continued weekly covid testing affects the prefrosh\u2019s impression of MIT.\n\n(not so related point but I don\u2019t think cpw gives an authentic view of how MIT is in the first place either; it\u2019s mainly for prefrosh to have fun. current students are hosed and drowning in midterms at that time of year.)",

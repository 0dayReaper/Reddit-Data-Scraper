I saw it, went to class, and came back an hour later and it was gone. We assume it was mistakenly removed by facilities/custodial services as they thought it was broken and was trash.\n\nI guess someone could have stolen it, but it was an 80 pound vacuum pump, so if someone did steal it, must have been pretty buff (or had a cart).",

            "comment": "CAC sucks. They have a very bizarre arrangement where they are primarily responsible for the maintenance of the buildings they control --including W20, Walker, and several others-- instead of the central Department of Facilities. They are very ill-equipped to handle such a responsibility and too stingy to do it right. W20 is hideously outdated and crammed (thank god they're starting a long-overdue renovation soon), Walker is deteriorating and its basement looks like something you'd find in an Urbex video. Also, since they insist on having their own staff around whenever the building is open, they just lock down whenever they don't feel like dealing with it, including overnight and the entirely of holiday breaks. This is super disruptive to the student groups and businesses that actually have work to do there. The rest of campus doesn't seem to have any trouble staying open 24/7, at least to affiliates. Ironically, this also means there is nobody around overnight to catch things like leaks and burst pipes before they become catastrophes. This isn't even the first flood in W20 of the school year. Meanwhile, nowhere else on campus had a flood anywhere close in magnitude to this over the weekend despite being subject to the same subzero temperatures.",

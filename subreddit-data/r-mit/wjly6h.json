    "postText": " I am an incoming grad student at MIT and was wondering if anyone could talk about their experience with the orchestra. I play the bass and am hoping to join this fall! How is the conductor; are there commitments outside of rehearsals and concerts (sectionals etc); what is the overall atmosphere like? I would appreciate any other helpful things to know too!",

            "comment": "It's a fantastic program. Adam Boyles is a fantastic conductor, and he really makes sure that prep for each concert cycle is a ton of fun. The rep is on par for a non-conservatory orchestra, and tackles a good mix of well-known pieces with a decent balance of contemporary and modern compositions. Often features collaborations with MIT Arts faculty or other ensembles. Prep depends on the level of the ensemble in a given year and how it matches to the difficulty of the rep. Usually sectionals are ad hoc and in lieu of a full ensemble rehearsal - typically a few times early in the concert cycle.\n\nDepending on your skill level, you'll probably want to invest in practice outside of rehearsal. Membership grants you access to the practice rooms in Bldg 4... as a grad student I found that late evenings or mornings on the weekend worked best if I wanted to snag a room for an hour or two.\n\nAs a grad student, know that membership can skew young... In most years I played with the ensemble, freshmen/sophomore undergrads were a large block of the ensemble. In my time we did a lot of community building though, so it was social and enjoyable nevertheless. Usually there's a sizable Wellesley contingent.\n\nOverall it's a great experience. There are lots of other opportunities for orchestral and ensemble playing in Boston/Cambridge, too.",

            "comment": "Adam Boyles is a great conductor, one of the best I've ever played for. Participating in MITSO or any of the performing ensembles is a very rewarding experience, extending beyond just playing classical repertoire. Thanks to Adam/MITSO alone, I've played world premiers, accompanied a Stradivarius violin, and played for Gustavo Dudamel. And those are just three highlights that come to mind, and Fred Harris with MITWE/FJE has given me even more opportunities.\n\nTime commitment sort of depends on your skill level. The expectation is high--this is not some ensemble to just show up and mess around. So you might need to put some practice time in, depending on how hard the music is for you. There aren't scheduled sectionals though.\n\nI'm happy to answer any further questions, I've been involved with most of MIT's musical offerings at one point or another. But I would just say, you should definitely go for it. It's a great experience, and very welcoming to everyone.",

It\u2019s a low commitment student group for arranging and playing video game soundtracks (and occasionally film and other media as well). We have one 2 hour rehearsal a week and one concert a semester. Some members also play in MITSO so it\u2019s definitely doable. We have a YouTube channel if you want to see what we\u2019ve played in the past.",

            "comment": "Loved my time in MITSO! I will say, I barely got in, was at the back of the violin section, and the music was HARD. It was a lot to juggle for me, I practiced a lot. In the end I almost couldn't pass one of the play through tests. Adam was firm with me and tried to teach me, he got a little annoyed at times, but in the end was nice and didn't rake me over the coals and passed me. \n\nJust my two cents \ud83d\ude05\n\nOh also, once the seniors went out with Adam to sing karaoke at a bar. Super fun honestly",

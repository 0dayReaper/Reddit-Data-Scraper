I\u2019m not sure what you mean by visiting laboratories, but if you mean meeting with a mentor, it depends on the lab but I think once a week is pretty typical.\n\nMost UROPs (from my experience) crop up by a student emailing profs, post docs, or grad students who work in fields they\u2019re interested in and things go from there",

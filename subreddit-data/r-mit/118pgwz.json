    "postText": "MIT students claimed all 5 Putnam Fellows plus the Elizabeth Lowell Putnam Prize. Detailed info:  Papon Lapate (freshman) and Luke Robitaille (freshman), Brian Liu (sophomore),  Mingyang Deng (junior), and Daniel Zhu (senior). Daniel is now a four-time Putnam Fellow. Luke just keeps adding to his otherworldly number of \\[superlative\\] achievements.\n\nThen MIT students were 9 of the next 11 (so 14 out of the top 16) and 21 out of the top 25 and 70 out of the top 100.\n\nOfficial information:\n\n[https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Putnam/2022/AnnouncementOfWinnersFall2022.docx%20%281%29.pdf](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Putnam/2022/AnnouncementOfWinnersFall2022.docx%20%281%29.pdf)\n\n[https://math.mit.edu/](https://math.mit.edu/)\n\n[https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/putnam2022results.html](https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/putnam2022results.html)\n\nI'm sure Prof. Yufei Zhao also deserves congratulations (and our thanks) as well!",

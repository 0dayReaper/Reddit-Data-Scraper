I already finished self-selection and submitted license agreement along with the documents required for spouse/partner. I just wonder if i need to wait for any kind of approval for the spouse/partner documents (we use joint bank account) as we are planning to purchase the flight asap? How many confirmations should i wait for to know i surely can move in..?",

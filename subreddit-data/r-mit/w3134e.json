    "postText": "Ahead of moving in I was hoping some current graduate students could answer a couple questions about housing:\n\n1) If my move in date is in August, it seems like rent is charged as soon as I move in. However, it seems like my stipend only kicks in from September onwards, so I was wondering if I am understanding the rent schedule correctly.\n\n2) I will be in Tang Hall - is there a place to keep my bike somewhere inside the building?\n\nThanks!",

So August rent is due August 31st. If I recall from when I first moved in, housing will wait until September to charge you for the fraction of August + September rent together. So yes, you will be living in your apartment for a bit before you get a paycheck from MIT\n\n2) I don't live in Tang, but I imagine there is a bike garage/ protected area for your bike. The other graduate apartments have it.",

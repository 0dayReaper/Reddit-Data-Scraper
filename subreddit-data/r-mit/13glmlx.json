    "postText": "Hello guys! \nI\u2019m 38 years old with a Bachelors degree in business/marketing from UNLV.\nI own different companies in the fields of software, RNA/DNA diagnostics and live event production. My history is unconventional and I was 14 years old when left my house. My love for science is is taking me back to academia and MIT is the target. I have ideas in molecular biology, software and collaboration with MIT would be a prize. Any thoughts or suggestions to pursue this path?",

Research admission requirements:\n\nHere are typical general requirements accepted:\n\nBiology:\n\u2022 A bachelor's degree in a related field (such as biology, biochemistry, or molecular biology)\n\n\u2022 Strong academic performance (a GPA of 3.5 or higher is recommended)\n\n\u2022 Scores from the GRE (General Test) and/or the GRE (Subject Test) in biology or biochemistry\n\n\u2022 Letters of recommendation from professors or other professionals who can attest to your academic ability and research potential\n\n\u2022 A statement of purpose explaining your research interests and career goals\n\n\u2022 Research experience in biology or a related field, either through coursework, internships, or other activities\n\nSoftware:\n\u2022 A bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field\n\n\u2022 Strong academic performance (a GPA of 3.5 or higher is recommended)\n\n\u2022 Scores from the GRE (General Test) or the GMAT\n\n\u2022 Letters of recommendation from professors or other professionals who can attest to your academic ability and potential for success in graduate school\n\n\u2022 A statement of purpose explaining your research interests and career goals\n\n\u2022 Programming experience, either through coursework, internships, or personal projects\n\n\u2022 Some programs may require additional materials, such as a coding sample or a research proposal\n\n2. Prepare for standardized tests:\nMake sure you look into GRE or GMAT score requirements for the specific program you're interested in.\n\u2022 GRE: https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/\n\u2022 GMAT: https://www.mba.com/exam-prep\n\n3. Build your academic credentials:\nYou mentioned you have a business / marketing degree. Just make your you don't need to take attentional courses in order to meet any prerequisite requirements for your choice program. Community college or the previous Sloan suggestion could be looked into. I know that MIT offers online courses elsewhere through eDX this could be worth looking into.\n\n4. Gain relevant experience:\nWith two companies you shouldn't have any issue here...\n\n5. Reach out to faculty members:\nThis is my number one suggestion as the saying goes the more people you know the more opportunities you'll have. If there are specific faculty members at MIT whose work interests you, reach out to them and introduce yourself. Ask if they would be willing to meet with you to discuss their research and potentially collaborate on projects.\n\n6. Consider alternative programs: \nMIT offers a number of non-degree programs and online courses that may be a good way to gain additional knowledge and experience in your field of interest. However, you should ultimately set your sights on what you want and overcome anything in your path. You're 38, you know what you want, you've achieved so much already... keep going. Move mountains. Don't let another human, decision board, or anything discourage you. Ultimately if you have to create your own path you will do it and I commend you on your path.\n\nKeep in mind that any admission boards (especially when you get deeper) look more and more at the whole person. I'm sure you have quite a story to tell. So the biggest goal for you would simply be looking into any prerequisite courses and knocking those out or potentially getting some kind of override.\n\nAnyways, hope this helps and if you need anything feel free to reach out to me!",

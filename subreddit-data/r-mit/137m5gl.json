Given that no rooms were available for most of the morning and then to see a bunch of Grad Tower rooms open up all of sudden made me think that the housing folks intentionally were releasing the more expensive option first. Warehouse opened half an hour later and gone in the blink of an eye. Glad was able to add a room and checkout! Strongly suspect an invisible hand at play.",

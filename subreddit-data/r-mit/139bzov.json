    "postText": "Hi. I\u2019m aware that course 8-flex has a focus area requirement, which states that one has to take 3 related subjects, not necessarily in physics, in order to complete this requirement. If one completes an official track of study, such as a minor or double major, it would make sense to think that the subjects in that minor/second major are related. Can any 3 subjects taken in the minor or second major just double count with the focus area requirement?",

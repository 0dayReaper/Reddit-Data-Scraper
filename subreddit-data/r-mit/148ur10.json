OCW has an overwhelming amount of resources, and not sure how to best optimize my time in these next 2 months. currently, i'm doing all the stuff (lectures, readings, examples, practice problems, psets etc.), but not sure if this is worth it\n\nalso, do proofs tend to appear on the 18.02 final exam? i'm especially worried about those. thank you!!",

The ocw won't have the necessary linear algebra most likely because they've been adding it recently. As far as I know, there are no proofs.",

It was a monsoon, we were all outdoors, there was no contingency plan, and the gowns are not colorfast -- every article of clothing turned purple!",

It wasn't great (most of the parents ended up watching on CCTV (back when CCTV was a thing at the institute.)) So the admins somehow decided it wasn't worth it, and everyone should just deal with the rain? Odd.\n\nSpoiler: I *finally* got sunshine when I walked for the PhD, so I'm not totally cursed, just 2/3rd's cursed.",

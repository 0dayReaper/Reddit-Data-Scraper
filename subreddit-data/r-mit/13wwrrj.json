            "comment": "Context: I live in Simmons and have eaten at all dining halls a good deal.\n\nWhen I say \"buffet,\" I am referring to the dished under the heat lamps. This is likely what you are going to be eating the most at any dining hall. Always has 2 protein options, 2 carbs, veggies, vegan option. The choices rotate daily and are different at every dining hall.\n\nSimmons - Hands down best stir fry on campus, line does get long but if you go at the right time, it's worth it. Grill is decent, consistent burgers and hotdogs. The buffet food is decent and consistent.\n\nNew Vassar - Seems like it's always open. Has a great sandwich station. Lots of options, though buffet food is below average quality. \n\nMaseeh - Open even more frequently than New Vassar. By far the most variety of food on campus. Buffet is more than 2-3x the size of McCormick, Baker, or Simmons. Always has a nice fruit and desert selection. Made to order food is mid, food is overall below average quality. Good if you don't really care about food quality and want variety/flexible eating hours.\n\nMcCormick - Smaller selection, nice salad bar, generally not too full. The buffet foods are always solid. Can't really go wrong eating here.\n\nBaker - Buffet section is known to be worst on campus, quite oily and tasteless. However, the best grill on campus. Come here if you want a really good burger or quesadilla. \n\nNext - Decent selection, buffet options above average. Very consistent grill area. Next's fried foods (chicken tenders, fries, onion rings, mozzarella sticks) have never missed, always solid and always there.\n\nAll dining halls have ice cream and deserts. Seafood comes onto the menu periodically, but it rotates. In general, fish is the only seafood that is commonly served, but most people think it's below average quality.\n\nIn general, you can check the menu of all of the dining halls and go to the one you like within a few minutes walk. Every one serves something different every night so just go with whichever has the food you most enjoy. You are not confined to eating at the dorm you live in, even though it is a bit more convenient.",

            "comment": "to add on to what other commenters have said:\n\nmaseeh is the most accommodating dining hall, and they have the most options because of it. they always have vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, kosher, and halal options, and there\u2019s probably something else i\u2019m forgetting. it\u2019s never the best on campus, but it\u2019s never the worst either, because there\u2019s always *something*.\n\nmccormick has the least options, it\u2019s just really small. it can be really good, but if you don\u2019t like either of the 2 options they have, there aren\u2019t really any consistent alternatives aside from the salad bar. if you do like them, though, it\u2019s probably the best on campus. \n\nduring the semester i would usually just go to maseeh, but sometimes i\u2019d check the website and pick mccormick instead if i wanted what was there that day. i didn\u2019t really go to the other dining halls consistently because they were too far.",

Tons of vegetarian and vegan options, healthier options than some of the other dorms (like Baker) and it's generally less busy. \n\nBaker has always had lots of grill items, even before the current dining system. Burgers, quesadillas, chicken tenders, etc. Even though that's where I lived I rarely ate there because it was always busy and it's not as healthy food as McC.",

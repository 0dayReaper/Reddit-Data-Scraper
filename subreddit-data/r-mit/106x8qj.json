    "postText": "I'm a first year thinking of majoring in 14-1 economics and I was wondering if it would be a bad idea to take both macro and micro this spring semester. I didn't take any econ classes in fall semester and I've taken AP Macro in high school but that doesn't give any credits. Thank you!",

            "comment": "it\u2019s a lot of work (classes mon-thur, homework assigned every single day), but if you show up and do the homework, you can get an A. a big portion of the grade is made up of participation and homework. assignments aren\u2019t too bad. maybe like a practice worksheet. lots of speaking practice. i took spanish 3 last spring and there was online practice work. you\u2019ll have to write essays and have speaking tests, which i think are a little more difficult than the written unit exams. overall, i think the problem is that spanish classes (and most language classes in general) are not necessarily hard but it\u2019s a decent amount of work you\u2019d have to do pretty much everyday. not to discourage OP though! i really liked my class and i learned a lot :)",

It is not intellectually extremely difficult, but it's probably about 90-100 mins of work 4 days per week including class and homework. A isn't guaranteed, I got a B+/B+/A/A over the course of 4 semesters. Had a lot of trouble with imperfect past tense (era vs fue)",

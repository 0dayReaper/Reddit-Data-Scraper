Doesn't really seem like it would be given that it's a top-end tech institute, but I could be wrong",

The physios and access to training facilities are just about as elite as it gets, and the team has all the coaching, assistant coaching, and roster depth you would ever want at the D3 level.  And many football players are members of the same fraternity conveniently on campus (70% of MIT men are in a fraternity, so they tend to just be communities of average, chill dudes).\n\nThere is probably only one downside to playing football (or any other sport) at MIT. 80+% of students don't have the chance to sleep as much as they would want to for peak performance.  I've noticed it being less of an issue among lineman-types who can out-eat their poor sleep recovery, but know that your football career might plateau.  That shouldn't factor too much into your decision unless you're hoping to go to the NFL, in which case there are only like 5 colleges you should be looking at if you had your pick of anywhere.",

Intellectually/Conceptually challenging (e.g., Fluid Mechanics/Fluid Dynamics, doing convolution in your head, etc.)\n2. Lots of work (like you have to put in a ton of leg-work) e.g., Studio, Lab classes like 6.111, 6.170, project lab\n3. tough grading -- I'm not sure MIT does this as much these days, but there used to be C/C+ centered classes. Other universities have weed-out classes or weed-out years.\n4. A senior year capstone that combines all of your lower-level classes and exposes your weaknesses e.g., Systems Engineering.\n\nIf one were admitted to MIT, one has the werewithal to graduate. You might not know everything, but you have a system around you.\n\nFor instance, MIT students have access to subject evaluations and upperclassmen and you read up what the course entails and what is most helpful or you talk with upperclassmen veterans and get recommendations/suggestions.\n\nIf it's \"lots of work\" you just have to time-budget for that. One semester I didn't have time for lunch for a few weeks (it was classes+doing labwork/getting results from the Wind Tunnel for my afternoons). If you end up taking 6.111 Spring semester, you plan on not having much of a Spring break (meaning you spend a lot of time in the lab/working on your project).\n\nAnd you plan on not having too many classes that are notable time sinks (like you try to have one time sink per semester).\n\nWith \"tough grading,\" the vast majority of students at MIT don't have perfect GPAs. I tell interviewees 1) many to most MIT students see their first B's and C's for the first time in the lives, 2) a C grade at MIT is no trivial task and is a good grade, and B's are solid achievements, and 3) set your expectations accordingly. And most MIT students (with notable exceptions like premed/grad school types) aren't really concerned about getting perfect grades at MIT.\n\nOne still tries one's best.\n\nIf it's \"conceptually difficult,\" there are lots of ways to tackle that. Read the relevant course information before lectures, go over the problem sets before the lecture and map the problems to various lecture/materials, talk with TAs, go to tutorials, talk with upperclassmen, do the work, etc. I know it's nerdy (and maybe not really socially acceptable outside of MIT), but I even had friends like a grad student who took the easier-graded-but-same-materials version (graduate-level version) of Aerodynamics the previous term and we used to talk through my problem set and I'd make sure I was on the right track. He never did my work for me, but I'd just talk through various problems and know where those corresponded in the book/lectures/etc. I think there was only once he had to ask for a pen and paper.",

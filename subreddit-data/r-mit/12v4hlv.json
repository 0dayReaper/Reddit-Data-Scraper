    "postText": "Hi everyone! Im a student from Singapore and would like to ask regarding a university choice that I have to make between CS and CE. I have some prior coding experience as I took computing in high school and enjoyed it. However, I do understand that hardware is something essential and knowing both software and hardware is superior than knowing just one. This is why I'm inclined to CE. However, I do understand that this prevents me from getting a deeper knowledge in pure software, which is a con when applying for a software job. I have also heard that employers don't differentiate between a CS and CE student. Thus, could I get some advice on which major is better for me?\n\nThanks for reading!",

A CS degree will definitely teach you software, and I\u2019m assuming that it would be possible to take hardware classes to satisfy your degree requirement at your university (even while doing CS). Unless CENG will also teach you software, I think it\u2019s important to balance learning both and which will be more important for YOUR future",

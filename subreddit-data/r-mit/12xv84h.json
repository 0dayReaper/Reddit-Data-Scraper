    "postText": "Hi guys, international incoming grad student here.\n\nI would like to live on campus, and preferably in a shared housing facility, but I didn't really understand how the self-selection process works. I thought we could fill our profile on the housing portal, and then find students with similar hobbies/lifestyle on some kind of portal, but the housing portal only has a \"home\" and \"forms\" menu... \n\nDo you know if there is some online place where people can chat, get acquainted and maybe become roommates? Or is it possible via the housing portal, but later?",

Towards the end you are able to fill out your profile and look for someone to team up with or you can join an existing suite if there\u2019s a room available. You can see gender, username, bio etc for all tenants in suites that have rooms available",

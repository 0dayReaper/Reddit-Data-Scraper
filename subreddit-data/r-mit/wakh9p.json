    "postText": "Hey MIT reddit community, \n\nIncoming freshman here!\n\nI was wondering if minors are truly helpful? What is the purpose of doing a minior? \n\nI love learning for the sake of learning and intrisic motivation, but apart from that is there a solid reason to get a minior in something? \n\nAsking because I'm debating majoring in 6-3 or 6-4; right now, I am leaning 6-3 but wondering if I should minor in 6-4?\n\nThanks in advance for your answers--and all thoughts are welcome!",

            "comment": "The best piece of advice that I heard, and I'll pay it forward:\n\nDon't worry about your major or minor or concentration. Just explore and take classes that you find interesting. Whether you're a 6-3, 6-4, 2A6, 6-14, whether you want to minor in one of them, just don't think about it!\n\nEveryone is going to be hypergixated on their major and course # and which box they fit in; don't get me wrong, you'll find your own \"box\" within which you fit, but for your first year (maybe even 2 years), just don't worry about it. don't make endless courseroads don't obsess over the degree charts, just do what you're interested in, and you'll get enough advice &amp; experience to figure it out eventually.",

Raising awareness of issues across disciplines\n2. Providing credentialing\n\n*there are other benefits for society, though not so much for the Institute beyond a bit of signaling - setting up a new minor actually creates a burden on faculty\n\n\nHowever, the credentialing benefit is moot if you have an MIT degree, let alone one in a technical area closely related to the minor. So the primary benefit is in providing a concise model curriculum for students to reference. In this sense, you needn't actually minor in anything, but just refer to the minor when exploring areas you want to study. I often found that my preconception of what was most important to know in an area of study differed from the reality. Talking to other students and professors, and referring to curricula designs, helped me realign myself.\n\n\nSo **my overall recommendation would be to not officially minor in anything,** especially if it's closely related to your major, unless officially minoring gives you some other explicit benefit like access to something people not officially minoring don't get. Instead, just refer to the minor when deciding what to take. You will likely find that you're better served taking maybe 50-75% of the subjects required for a minor, and using your time for something else, like a UROP or other classes outside the minor, or something else entirely.\n\nEDIT: Of course, in the of chance that officially minoring *is* required to get certain relevant benefits while at the Institute, you can just officially minor without the intention of completing it, to have your cake and eat it too",

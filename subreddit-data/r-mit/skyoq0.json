It seems that MIT is way too formal in certain aspects, and not open enough to innovative ideas.\n\nI posted about one of the greatest developments in food science in decades, and they mocked my post (https://old.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/t2qwnz/mit_should_offer_bread_from_this_company_one/).  Seriously, the first thing they would bring up is tuition?  Tuition is going up all the time anyway.  It should be obvious enough that freshly milled grains taste better than most whole wheat flour that was probably stored at room temperature for months, though I would definitely support a peer-reviewed study on the matter.  But it's not that necessary, as nobody would be requesting a peer-reviewed study to determine whether fresh fruit is healthier than week-old fruit.  A peer-reviewed study would take a lot of time and money.\n\nI know it seems like advertising, but they are the only company making this kind of bread.  This sounds way more interesting than \"tuning the hyperparameters\", discussions about Facebook algorithms, adding smartphone cameras, and trying to make smartphones that are thinner by a couple millimeters.",

You can bet a lot of difficult discussions are now being had.",

As described in The New Yorker article, he and Cohen conspired to commit a fraud on MIT. This needs to be referred to the DOJ - especially if there was any co-mingling with federal grants.",

MIT receives hundreds of millions from donors. It doesn't need Epstein to run its research. \n\nThe fact Ito et al. Concealed the donations and involment for years is proof they themselves knew it wasn't kosher and would not be OK had it been public.\n\n\nThe second issue is that if the institute didn't know about this then is reflects poorly on the ability of the president to even be aware of what's going on inside the schools/departments. If he didn't know the extent of the issue until farrow's newyorker article, how can he ensures us today there's nothing more being hidden from the institute oversight (whether tied to Epstein or not)?\n\n\nFor me the amount of lying that went on all the way until this week's media lab pr meeting is just as bad as the amount of money that was channeled secretly by Epstein.",

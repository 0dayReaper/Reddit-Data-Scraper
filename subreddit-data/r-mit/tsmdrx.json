I still don't get what a union will do except making profs jobs even harder when securing funding for students and adding yet more administrative crap to sift through for everyone. I graduated less than 10 years ago and half my stipend went to rent. What's the problem with that? Grad housing was cheaper overall for my partner and I than living in the heart of Cambridge. MIT does however need to be fully transparent and release far more data to students than they currently do. \n\n\n\nHow about instead: fire the useless admins and endless consultants MIT hires to cater and tip toe around every sensitive issue, and pay the students to come up with unique solutions to their problems. It seems every time I look at what is going on, MIT is just becoming more like any other decent engineering college. They're more concerned about their stupid USA Today rankings than actually producing high-quality engineers who originally helped earn MIT their position in the world today.",

                    "comment": "The price of on campus graduate housing has skyrocketed. Living in the heart of Cambridge is actually cheaper than staying on campus for me (and results in a better quality apartment). We still don\u2019t have dental insurance included in our stipends or health insurance. Professors are allowed to abuse their graduate students with little recourse besides the student leaving their lab. They can threaten you on the basis of race, gender identity, etc and get away with it scot free if they have tenure. All of those outside consultants you mentioned? MIT just hired them for lip service. They have no power to actually get help for people being abused or harassed under those policies. They exist so MIT can pretend they act on that stuff for visit weekends and to cover their asses. Some labs overwork their students. I\u2019m talking regular 80+ hour weeks. I know for a fact that a certain PI over at the media lab admits students through themselves and almost exclusively picks international students. If they aren\u2019t available to meet with them on 1 hour notice at 2 am on a weekday (actual incident was 3 am btw)? They\u2019ll threaten to kick them out of the lab and start calling people to get their visas revoked. \n\nJust the dental insurance alone is worth a union, but there are so many other issues at stake. MIT is pushing a 5% raise to all the grad students\u2026while increasing on campus rent by nearly 5% and ignoring the recommendation of 7.4% minimum to keep up with a rising cost of living. There are also very few resources if you happen to be a graduate student with a family. I get you attended here a long time ago, but either things are different or you just glazed over the worst parts of your experience because it\u2019s been a decade. I talked to a guy who graduated from here in 2006. From the napkin math we did, MIT gave maybe 30-40% worth of a subsidy on housing. Now? It\u2019s closer to 10%, maybe. Not to mention, that\u2019s if you can find housing. I know myself and many people who were stuck on and couldn\u2019t get off the waiting lists for our first year, meaning that we\u2019d have to keep competing for spots in the following years to even try to stay on campus.\n\nMIT and the PIs working here take more than enough money into their labs as things stand. PIs wouldn\u2019t have to pay so much for us if MIT didn\u2019t charge them obscene tuition rates per semester, even for the semesters where we aren\u2019t taking classes and just doing research (which we already pay for by virtue of instrument use fees). The grad students here are already the cream of the crop, and yet other schools in cheaper areas pay and generally treat them a lot better. My first year offer from Princeton alone was over $10k greater than MIT\u2019s! Most schools are willing to cover the cost of moving or relocating, but again, not MIT. We deserve better.\n\nEDIT: oh, I\u2019d like to add: many professors don\u2019t even do all the work of getting funding. I know multiple people whose PIs have taken up too many positions, so they hand off almost all grant writing work to them. As in they have their graduate student write practically the whole grant and submit it under their (the PI\u2019s) name. Sometimes they\u2019ll have multiple students co-write them with each other, but those professors really don\u2019t do much in the way of getting funding themselves. They give talks and lord their 10 different jobs over people when they can\u2019t even put in the work for their first and most basic one.",

My stipend then was about $2800/mo. It was tight, but i was able to get by and no worries. My job was to graduate and get out of graduate school so i could start a real life. Being a graduate student is not a career, it's a means to an end. Get your degree and move on as quickly as you can. \n\nEdgerton 1br = 2200, doctoral stipend is 3400. The differential, at least for me is approximately the same with inflation at the moment. So i call bullshit on skyrocketing rates. [My source for rental rates](https://studentlife.mit.edu/grad-housing-rates) and [my source for graduate stipends](https://gradadmissions.mit.edu/costs-funding/stipend-rates). \n\nDental insurance i can agree with, and that should be part of the health insurance waiver. That said [dental insurance is $45/mo](https://medical.mit.edu/gsdp) which is incredibly cheap. That said, i do agree it should just be tacked onto the health insurance policy and done away with as a separate item.\n\n\n&gt;Professors are allowed to abuse their graduate students with little recourse besides the student leaving their lab. \n\nI call bullshit as all a student has to do is record actual abusive behavior and it'll put any faculty into hot water, particularly when it's blackmail regarding a student visa. This doesn't need a union to solve the problem, students just need to know they're not helpless and can speak up. \n\nI do agree that graduate housing is far too limited regarding the number of students and lack of practical housing when compared to Cambridge rent prices. Trim the fat from useless admins, and leave professors alone. \n\n\n&gt;MIT and the PIs working here take more than enough money into their labs as things stand. \n\nMIT may, but academic money is drying up quite fast compared to previous years, so no profs are not swimming in money. Not sure where you got that idea from. MIT's overall overhead is a significantly greater portion of its endowment because of all the labs they are running\n\n[Where are you getting your numbers for princeton?](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2022/01/25/princeton-will-significantly-increase-stipends-support-graduate-students) these are comparable graduate rates to MIT. \n\n\n&gt; oh, I\u2019d like to add: many professors don\u2019t even do all the work of getting funding. I know multiple people whose PIs have taken up too many positions, so they hand off almost all grant writing work to them.\n\nI was given this sort of work to do. It's called being an academic and is excellent training for people who want to go into academia. What better time to learn how to write grants than in graduate school? You're at MIT, not a middle-tier research institute. Put on your big kid pants, and get to work. If you want to parade yourself around as having earned a degree from the top engineering school in the world, then work like you earned it. As someone who graduated recently having gone through MIT from undergrad through 2 graduate degrees, I am incredibly thankful my PI pushed me hard in graduate school. I am singled out and put on the spot often because of where I earned my degrees. People outside of MIT expect a certain level of initiative and excellence from MIT graduates, and that bar gets raised even higher for PhDs.  \n\nI agree with stopping abusive PI's from doing inappropriate things, but PI's who push their students hard is just a natural part of being at MIT. You want that world-class degree that commands a lot of respect? You need to put in the grinding work to earn it.",

The argument being made by the unionization folks is that collective bargaining is the way to get the institution to make changes, like shifting resources to students by debloating administration. If the pool of funding is fixed, and stipends rise, that's exactly what's going to have to happen. I don't want anyone to lose their jobs, but endless administration isn't in and of itself a productive enterprise. It just tends to make work for itself. So I entirely agree with you there.",

But now, due to added layered of bureaucrats, union (in the form of your due) and MIT 'specialist' dealing with union, there is less money over left for our salary and other institutional expense.\n\n\n\nDo you know how graduate students are paid? Our PIs get grant money. They give grant money to the institute just to pay to be there. They then pay out of the remainder of the grant money to us. If they can't afford us, they can't take on new grad students. It is not from the same pot. Even across departmental funding sources, like TAships, that money is allocated and sourced from completely different areas on a department by department basis. The money goes to their accounts that only they and people listed on the accounts can take money from. If what you're saying is true, advisors would never ever have the problem of not having enough funding to cover a new student (not just project-wise, but stipend-wise. each student is ~$100k each year in grant money being spent). The money is MIT's, but MIT does not just take the money a lab gets in from grants, pools it, and distributes it across the school (or even a department!) And I don't understand the misconception that MIT is even remotely hurting for money and would have to cut things to pay for the relatively small expenses of a union besides benefits that graduate students deserve for carrying the institute on their collective back.\n\n&gt;About how some of these policies or how disruptive, take a strike that can last for months or years, will suspend most learning and research activities, even if you don't agree to any of that.\n\nAgain, good. If something is problematic enough that we strike for it (there is no way MIT would let it go on for years, they would sooner fall in and address it), it's worth it. A strike is not something you do because 1 advisor told somone to email them something ASAP past midnight. Take a look at Harvard, which has a grad student union, too. Their strikes have been about fair pay, acting to stop discrimination/bigotry, and other serious problems. And most importantly, strikes are voted on by the people striking. I will have a voice, but if I'm in the minority, I'm fine standing in solidarity with my fellow graduate students.\n\n&gt;For every issue, interaction between you and your advisor/institution, there is now another layer of union and MIT union 'specialist'. \n\nGood. My advisor is great, but some of my friends have had advisors that have even discriminated against and harassed them on the basis of who they were, and they had no option but to leave the lab. MIT would not get the advisor to stop the problem behavior and would not punish them, diversity representative or no, threats to their physical wellbeing be damned. The union won't intercede if you're talking with your advisor about deadlines, draft edits or research plans (despite MIT's attempts to represent it like that). It'll intercede if your advisor consistently gives the only minority in the lab more shit or worse opportunities than everyone else. Or if your advisor doesn't respect the basic human rights of one of their students who came out recently. Or if your advisor is the kind of person to yell and shout terrible things at you during group or 1 on 1 meetings. I know enough people that have been in those situations that even if I have some extra work injected in my good interactions with my great advisor, I don't mind. The slight inconvenience to me could make a world of difference to someone who is in a much worse situation, and I think that's fine.",

They then pay out of the remainder of the grant money to us. If they can't afford us, they can't take on new grad students.\n\nPrecisely, when the MIT get additional expense for \"specialist\" just to deal with union, they will take more from the income, in this case both PI grant and student tuition. And with PIs have less money left and also pay more for each graduate student and pay for union due, they simply have to cut back position, funding, equipment, hire etc. All MIT revenue and expense is of the same pool, and MIT will move money around to cover increased expense. It's basic finance.\n\n&gt;And I don't understand the misconception that MIT is even remotely hurting for money and would have to cut things to pay for the relatively small expenses of a union besides benefits that graduate students deserve for carrying the institute on their collective back.\n\nWhat you call a misconception is just basic fact. The money for you and union fees and admins fees in response to union are at the expense of someone else.\n\n&gt;Again, good. If something is problematic enough that we strike for it (there is no way MIT would let it go on for years, they would sooner fall in and address it), it's worth it.\n\nGood for whom? Really, who are you to make such judgement for anyone else? Who are you to say that it's worth it so that everyone will have to accept no matter if they agree with or consent to or not?\n\n&gt;I will have a voice, but if I'm in the minority, I'm fine standing in solidarity with my fellow graduate students.\n\nDo you always force anyone in the minority to accept whatever decided for them by the majority? \"Just stay shut and stand in for solidarity\", that how you want to be treat as minority? OK, but then again, why do you want to compel this conformity attitude on all minority? I get that being forced to belong, to be \"represented\" by an organization you don't consent to is part of union life. But please understand, not everyone loves such treatment.\n\n&gt;Good. My advisor is great, but some of my friends have had advisors that have even discriminated against and harassed them on the basis of who they were, and they had no option but to leave the lab... The slight inconvenience to me could make a world of difference to someone who is in a much worse situation, and I think that's fine.\n\nYou believe union would be helpful or effective in those cases, good for you. I don't have the same delusion. In all seriousness, I will find and use of representative that I actually choose and trust to act on my behalf, not something that being forced on me and \"represent\" me by default. People who actually have been through worse situation would know the differences. And also, dismissing such added burden you forced on everybody as slight convenient, so you can make believe that it would help someone in need is not a convincing argument. What make you think what's fine for you should be fine for all?",

This is already happening. This is anecdotally within engineering, but many of the best engineering students in my graduate time have left for industry because it pays so much better and there is so much less bureaucracy/concern for being sensitive to anything/everything. \n\nExpanding on my first point: Being a graduate student is temporary. So many other graduate schools require students to go into debt to attend. You are literally being supplied with free tuition and money to live. The net contribution for stipend + tuition is what, 150k/year with overhead? Cambridge rent is rediculous, so of course you'll lose out on a significant chunk of the stipend to rent. If folks can't afford food/travel that's one thing, but if people are able to eat, sleep, and afford some activities, things do not need to change regarding stipends. Again, this is a temporary situation while you get a degree from a world-class institution that will let you leverage HUGE amounts of cash after school. \n\nI wasn't in grad school too long ago and i never felt a tight pinch with the stipend/living in MIT housing, so i find it incredulous that students are up in arms over it. Where are their funds going? \n\nI'm all for protecting students from abusive PI's, but i think far too much blame is being placed on professors. Apply enough pressure, and the overall quality of the institute is going to drop. MIT is not supposed to be a comfortable safe place. It's meant to push you, and mold you into a hard-driving top-of-the-line professional who can take people getting in your face. Else it's just like any other college and we shouldn't consider it anything special, because it's quickly running out of material to differentiate itself from other schools. I cannot express to you how many times i've been under a microscope more often than others simply because of my graduate school, and I'm glad quals (for example) were as stressful and demanding as they were because they actually prepared me for the harsh reality outside of MIT.",

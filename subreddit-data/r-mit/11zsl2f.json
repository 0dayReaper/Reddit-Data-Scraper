    "postText": "Hi, I'm out of college for 6 years or so, and find myself woefully rusty on basic statistics (significance testing and such).  I was looking at the Open Courseware for MIT and there seems to be two good options: [18.05 Intro to Probability and Statistics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/pages/syllabus), and [18.650 Statistics for Applications](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/pages/syllabus/).  My heart says 18.05 because I love probability and the thinking behind it, but my mind says 18.650 in terms of job relevance (SWE that needs to understand statistically relevant differences in metrics for monitoring/reliability etc.).  What do you guys suggest?\n\n\n(I read the rules and it seems like this kind of post is okay, apologies in advance if not)",

It assumes (relatively recent) knowledge of calculus-based probability. 18.05 will likely be much more accessible and probably sufficient. 18.650 is also fairly theoretical, not too much of a practical focus.",

If you want a proper introduction to basic statistics look at the book by Freedman Pisani Purves.",

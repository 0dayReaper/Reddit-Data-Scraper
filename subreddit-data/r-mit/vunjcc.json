Rooms vary in size, number of roommates, actual conditions for the rest of the house in the summer, whether the bed is hung off a ceiling joist, et cetera.  \n\n\nYou're doing a summer stint at MIT, so you might as well make it something to write home about.",

So if you view friendships as transactional... makes some friends who live in frats/sororities! \n\nAnd other summer stuff, you'll catch wind of everything if you're on a dorms mailing list. It sounds like you're not an MIT student, so I don't know how it works for you, but you can add yourself to a dorm list on webmoira if you have a kerb/cert, otherwise ask your housing contact nicely about being on a mailing list.",

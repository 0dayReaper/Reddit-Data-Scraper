The electrical engineering department is just effectively dead and overridden by computer engineering.",

Class sizes are really small especially at higher level and some classes have been getting cut due to low enrollment.\n\nThat being said, the quality of instruction is top notch for almost all the the EE courses, especially at the higher level.  Since you mentioned them, the grad level RF and analog classes are both great, and prepare you very well for an IC design type job if that's what you're looking for. Would recommend!",

            "comment": "It\u2019s hard to explain it to people who weren\u2019t here, and it\u2019s crazy that today\u2019s MIT seniors only had, what, *one* semester before COVID?\n\nSo here\u2019s a really rambly argument for an open campus\u2026\n\nThe open campus added flavor to MIT.  There was that random guy who blasted music and juggled under the dome at like 2am every week.  I remember I went to an IAP course on superconductivity once, and there was this local artist who showed up.  She clearly had no idea what the lecturer was talking about, but made a sincere effort to understand the material and asked questions that no physicist would have thought up.  The open campus just made these little experiences more likely.  They\u2019d make my day, and I still remember them years later.  There was also the puzzle hunt (can that even happen anymore?), a pretty major event that attracted super-nerds from around the world, but was run by MIT undergraduates. It\u2019s just sad to think that MIT might permanently become a less colorful place if the campus stays closed.\n\nIn general, I worry that MIT is slowly becoming a more boring and generic university.  Even before COVID they cracked down on the hacking, and closed Senior House.  Two things that really helped make MIT feel unique.\n\nI assume that the open campus made MIT students more humble.  I grew up in the Boston area, and my impression was that locals liked MIT students more than Harvard students.  They felt like they were less pretentious and stuck up.  This may have been because MIT was more inclusive of the public, or it might have been because MIT students were less isolated from \u201cregular people\u201d and were thus more comfortable interacting with them.\n\nI wasn\u2019t an undergraduate so I can\u2019t confirm this, but I\u2019d imagine that a lot of the locals who hung out around MIT did so because they were interested in science, technology and engineering.  Their expertise might have been useful for whatever wacky, nerdy projects undergrads wanted to make happen.\n\nDidn\u2019t Jaron Lanier loaf around MIT for like a year before he went and invented all the VR things?\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I never felt unsafe on MIT campus while it was open.  I\u2019d imagine that MIT campus is one of the safer parts of Cambridge, and Cambridge is a very safe city.  The campus was also never *completely* open.  Dorms, labs, and various study spaces still required key card access.  So there were still \u201csafe spaces\u201d.\n\nAnd then a pragmatic point\u2014the TIM ticket system just adds a layer of complexity to things.  Every visitor, or caterer, or study participant, etc. needs to think about one more thing before they can access campus.  It takes up people\u2019s time and headspace, and it\u2019ll lead to hundreds of minor but annoying experiences.  So it\u2019s not worth implementing, in my opinion, unless the net benefit is significant.\n\nFinally, I don\u2019t think the COVID argument is relevant in the long term.  Even if it were a major health risk to re-open campus now (which I disagree with), the risk level will probably recede to somewhere near pre-COVID levels at some point in the near future.  So if you oppose re-opening campus now, maybe think about whether you\u2019d still oppose re-opening if COVID weren\u2019t a factor.  Because at some point it won\u2019t be.",

I saw robots and projects that had graced the covers of magazines and TV shows in person. I bumped into the actual people who wrote several of the books I read on robotics. I realized that all these amazing I only dreamed about... they were just student projects that somebody made over maybe a year or more. If I worked at something for a few years I could do the same thing and it turns out I could. The people were happy to show me what they created, especially the older folks.\n\nI took that inspiration and got to work on space robotics and I'm still in touch with some of the people I met. It was awe inspiring and I'm sad I can't repeat it right now. \n\nThat said Covid protocols make sense. They need to be in place as long as necessary but communicating with people much easier now. Conferences are online now. No need to buy plane tickets or hotel rooms. Everybody works remote and you can zoom call just about anyone. \n\nThis too shall pass.",

If anyone in this thread wants that, then here's a plane ticket to Chengdu, sounds like your kind of place right about now. (Don't go there brag about how much you support it to the locals, though, they're getting tired of it too from what I hear. Turns out only places that don't actually have lockdowns like lockdowns.)\n\nI haven't had access to zephyr in a long time but I'm hoping if there's discussion of this there, it's better than those circlejerks on twitter, considering a few of the commonalities in interaction style (paragraph-size tweets/zgrams, disjointed pseudo-threading, funny/snotty taglines/gecos)\n\nOtherwise you can stop using endemic Covid to justify tearing up organic social interactions, destroying public access to resources, over what's now just another endemic common cold to join the 4 endemic human coronaviruses we already have (and that's just the ones we know about!): https://www.slowboring.com/p/covid-1889",

And Tim tickets have proven unworkable and a poor way to handle those despite them having 2 years to get it right.\n\n\"when everyone was sick\" lmao I guess you're claiming the right to be protected from the common cold. If that's the case then it's you who should just move yourself and everything you do online and live in a bubble.\n\nOrganic social interactions like the kind everyone has talked about losing here. Lectures and special events, professors wanting to find people interested in a topic. Clubs, activities, even some that *depended* on community involvement because not enough students to keep all of it going. Like these:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realBurhanAzeem/status/1560730055348609024\n\nhttps://twitter.com/lsi1123/status/1564680445979156480\n\nhttps://twitter.com/lsi1123/status/1564088041601482753\n\nhttps://twitter.com/netiamccray/status/1560774386554224644\n\nAnd oh noes, startups offering jobs in the hallways. Wish there'd been any of that back in my day. You have no idea how snotty and privileged you sound literally complaining about 6-figure jobs being dropped in your lap.\n\nAnd good luck with alumni donations. Your probably less than $80k a year (subsidized by generous financial aid) is only part of the story. And given the community outcry, it's clearly ***not*** \"the way anyone attending or working at MIT prefers it\", liar.",

Most even just in the Boston area don't, even right now, save Harvard and MIT. They aren't high schools. If you insist on treating them as such then maybe we need to set a minimum age of at least 20 to attend university as you are clearly too immature to be accountable for your own safety out in the world. The only unusual thing about MIT previously is that some buildings were open and unlocked 24/7, which just about nobody is demanding a return to. (Historically, before card readers, most colleges just locked the doors to everyone overnight, and MIT was unusual in sometimes not doing so.)\n\nPublic universities are usually required to be largely open to the public, especially for purposes of library access and community outreach. Maybe if MIT won't play ball they shouldn't get any *public* funding either, including the taxpayer funded financial aid that helped get you your degree, or any federal research funding, amirite? And yes, the libraries get public funding too (the Federal Depository Library program) and they are probably *already* not in compliance with its conditions. Not the only reason to lobby to restrict that funding (skyrocketing tuition is the big one, IMO; MIT may finally provide enough financial aid but other institutions match the tuition hikes without matching the aid increases) but it's a pretty good one.\n\n\"No clubs depend on public involvement; Idk what you're talking ahout (sic) here\" --&gt; clearly you haven't read the many replies to the open letter advocating for this policy to be rescinded. You could start by doing that.

Nobody goes to a library just looking for research from one place.\n\nEven if you got a silver spoon grant covering your whole tuition somehow (which is rare; I've never seen an institution not try to flex the federal money first so as to spread and max out the impact of other donations). Taxpayer money still funds research which funds the entire Institute, as well as parts of many other activities, often under the assumption there is public benefit.",

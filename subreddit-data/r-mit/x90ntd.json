    "postText": "Hey all,\n\n\u00a0A few years ago, I, along with a couple of other people created a startup around a product idea that was meant to be an advanced and efficient summarization AI model, which would create abstractive, nonplagiarized summaries while retaining the essence of the text being summarized. Surprisingly, we were able to at least implement aspects of our product idea, even creating a somewhat finished test app around the product and really developing the other aspects of the project, with a host of pitch decks, investor contact lists, and executive summaries. Things were turning so well for us in fact, that we even were able to get a meeting with the CEO of Snapchat. However, nothing came to fruition from that as we had hoped, and due to a variety of compounding factors such as school, work, and especially team communication, one by one, the other members of the project left(as well as relinquishing their legal involvement with this project), leaving just me with the pieces. However, I still have much of our investor/business material and work on my google drive, and can likely gain access to the majority of tech aspects of our project(the unfinished app, base code/AI algorithm, etc). \u00a0So, even though over 90 percent of startups fail, I believe that this project deserves to be reignited, that's why I am looking for skilled cofounders(particularly in Biz Dev, tech, and marketing) that would be of course EQUAL equity, and who are motivated in making sure this project beats that statistic!\n\nAs for a bit of background on me, I am a college student, with a passion for exploring new ideas and have thrown myself into a wide area of diverse projects, which have allowed me to gain a variety of unique and impactful experiences that I believe will translate well into the startup field. If you're interested in becoming a co-founder of this project, just hit me up with a DM anytime!",

    "postText": "So my daughter just got accepted to MIT.    This has been her dream school since I can remember and words simply cannot express how happy she is.     I am a single father who makes about 225K per year.   Mother passed when she was young unfortunately.  After mortgage (nothing crazy, about $2,000 per month), taxes and other expenses (I have no other debt), i have about 5K left per month.    MIT awarded my daughter only 10K per year and is expecting me to pay the rest.     I am super worried about having to pay 72K+ per year.    I feel like I can pay half, but does MIT really expect me to use 100% of my disposable income (which even then wouldn\u2019t be enough to cover the 72K)?     I am thinking that I will need to take out a loan, but what are the chances that a bank is going to approve 35K to 40K per year (my credit is good).    Should I talk to the financial counselor?  Could really use some advice here.    I recognized that I am blessed with what I make and willing to pay my fair share - but this seems unreasonable and really don\u2019t want to let my daughter down who has worked so hard for this opportunity.\n\nThanks",

            "comment": "There are lots of ways to make MIT cheaper than the sticker price. The 82k a year figure assumes the most expensive double room and rather high food and personal expenses. Some ways I personally managed the cost:\n- living in a cheaper dorm without a meal plan. This alone saved me thousands, the meal plans are incredibly expensive.\n- never bought a single book. In my experience not a ton of classes at MIT actually require textbooks, and when they do many living communities keep around copies for members to use, or they can be obtained online fairly easily. \n- student jobs. There are tons of opportunities for student work at MIT, including doing paid research which is an excellent learning opportunity. With my student jobs I was able to cover all of my food and living expenses. Most people also either UROP or work at internships during the summer, which for me was also a chance to save up for the following year.\n\nI believe my expected parent contribution was around 15k and in the end between my savings, student jobs and such they ended up paying nothing. That being said, MIT also must have expected them to be putting pretty much all of their disposable income towards tuition, so I don't think this is that unusual of a consideration in their aid. Honestly though, if you need some loans to swing it, MIT is one of the few schools for which I'd say I think it is worth it - starting salaries for graduates are some of the highest of any school and I personally felt like the return on investment was excellent.",

Everytime I hear someone complain about finaid, they are still able to cover it and somehow able to live a much better lifestyle than people whose need is 100% covered. MIT gives some of the most generous aid of any school, and has some of the best opportunities. Our broader system of for profit education and high interest student loans is indefensible, but in the context of it MIT goes above and beyond most schools. They may have a large endowment, but that endowment covers a lot more than just student aid, and I personally would prefer them to err on the side of caution in preventing that endowment from becoming depleted so they can remain need blind and continue to cover the poorest applicants.",

My primary frustration is that their tabulation of need does not take into account enough factors, it is merely income based which is only a small sliver of overall financial health.  What about multiple children in college?  Only the slightest of discounts is offered for that circumstance.  What about families that live in high-cost areas regardless of income?  The difference in dorm prices is absolutely negligible when paying over $60K/year, so no gain there.  My child does work.  The internships pay peanuts and the income he gets from that job helps to cover other living expenses outside of tuition.  I don't expect my child to live high on the hog, especially as a college student, but there is no reason an institution like MIT should expect or desire its students to live like paupers.  As somebody who had to use student loans to finance part of my education, it is certainly not preferable.  The rates are astronomical especially when you are considering loans potentially in hundreds of thousands of dollars.  The bottomline is MIT has many many billions of dollars in endowments.  They could easily make the school more affordable for all, but they opt not to do that while thumping their chests that they are meeting \"need\".  Not necessarily.",

But if your income increased so much so fast, are there added lifestyle costs that are eating into what you could be putting toward her college fund?  Any costs for her lifestyle that aren\u2019t so necessary to keep covering while she\u2019s at MIT (car payments, memberships, etc)? (I\u2019m not expecting you to justify your spending  here btw.)\n\nIn any case, I really hope between student loans, scholarships, and everything else that you can make it work.  Best of luck to you both!",

If you save every day since her birth 10 dollars it will be $61k even if you don\u2019t make any investments. If you investment every day $10 it will be so much more and totally enough to cover a huge chunk of tuition.",

They can talk you through your various obligations, make sure the award is appropriate, and, if a loan is the right decision, guide you toward the best options for her (student loans are a totally different game than regular loans). As others have said, your situation is common.",

            "comment": "Several people are suggesting that your daughter apply for external scholarships. You should be aware that MIT's policy is that any external scholarships decrease the amount of aid MIT gives first before decreasing the parental contribution, so if MIT is awarding you 10k, your daughter would need to earn at least 10k in external scholarships for it to make a dent in your expected contribution. I know several people who didn't know about this policy, worked hard on winning external scholarships, and then had $0 of it actually go towards decreasing their cost.\n\nBut the other commenters here are also correct that living in a cheaper dorm, not getting the meal plan (it's a scam anyway), UROPing or doing other jobs during the school year, and doing internships during the summer makes a huge difference. I'm supposed to pay MIT 10k/year but I end up actually getting some money back because of my cheap living situation and lack of meal plan. I don't know what major your daughter is interested in, but if she wants to work in CS or engineering, she can probably find decently well-paying internships during the summers as well.\n\nHope everything works out for you!",

Being saddled w debt for MIT (or anywhere really) is simply not worth it.  Also not a guarantee If she got into MIT she will make the kind of money to pay it back.  If she got into MIT she most likely got scholarships at other schools.   You should seriously consider other options.   She will likely need graduate school - then what?",

    "postText": "Apparently it is a really big project in the 60s to improve secondary physics education, and it seems like MIT professors played a really big role in it. I haven't been able to find much about what happened to the PSSC nor the Nuffield physics projects - it seems like it just died, which is real sad. Now what is interesting is that although I can find quite a number of studies, reports and books/films on it from the 60s, I couldn't find what happened to it after 1980 or how it has impacted physics education now. There isn't even any hints on what it merged with or any of its surviving remnants - all that's left are the books and (amazing) films produced during that era \\[oh, and the ticker tape timer. The PSSC pioneered this cheap mechanism so that schools can afford it, and it's still a staple part of physics O Level LMAO. Got it from here: [https://www.forodeeducacion.com/ojs/index.php/fde/article/download/826/452](https://www.forodeeducacion.com/ojs/index.php/fde/article/download/826/452) \\]. Such a shame that these revolutionary change in physics education just, *poof*, gone from mainstream secondary education.\n\nAnyways, I'm just your average teenage physics lover and nerd, I don't know much about US physics education and I am terrible at searching up articles, so if you're interested, perhaps you can find lots more information about it lying around in some untouched corners of a library. And do tell me if you know anything about the evolution of physics education - I grew up reading *Physics for the Inquiring Mind*, made me love physics, and I was dying to know why aren't there any more books just like that being written. Thanks a tonne &lt;3",

It was a system to transform science teaching.\n\nYou can piece together some of the history which accounts for the fade out. For example, [https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2819975?journalCode=pto](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2819975?journalCode=pto)\n\nIts intellectual successor is modeling instruction ([https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/modeling-instruction-in-ap-physics-c-chapter-one-eb62ff9c12eb](https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/modeling-instruction-in-ap-physics-c-chapter-one-eb62ff9c12eb)). \n\nIts sister initiative, BSCS, spun out from its university ties and lives on  as a non-profit. They are a leading independent research and practice organization. https://bscs.org/",

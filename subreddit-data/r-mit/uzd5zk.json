    "postText": "I defended my PhD in June of 2020 and only got a virtual celebration but I found out today from my friend's boyfriend that the class of 2020 and 2021 are invited to walk tomorrow... I was never informed about it (triple checked my emails in case I missed it) and I'm really sad I can't walk after spending 6 years suffering in grad school. I'm extra disappointed because I'm an immigrant that came here for grad school and I was really looking forward to that American graduation experience.  \nI can borrow regalia from a friend of a friend so that part would be fine. \nI tried emailing the commencement help email but obviously the ceremony is in 12 hours so they won't answer. If anybody working there has insight and or contacts please lmk \nThanks \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf93\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf93\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf93\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf93",

I felt like it was only going to end up in me being stressed out, tired and disappointed and that it wasn't worth it. \nSo I'm just gonna try to make my peace with the fact that I probably won't ever walk for my degree",

I was quite disappointed to learn about the mistake a week before the event with no time left to find regalia.\n\nAfter asking around for garb I heard multiple stories of this happening across different MIT departments.",

The other early and possibly helpful option would be this listed event:\n\"Saturday, May 28, 7:30 am\u20138 am\nSatellite Check-in, Tech Reunions Breakfast, Kresge Oval\" where maybe someone from the Alumni Association could advise you. Good luck!",

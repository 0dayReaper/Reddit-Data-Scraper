I loved it and the community really made me feel at home when most of us do come from other parts of the country.  One thing though is watch out for the Harvard kids.  They feel like they have to be on some high horse about what it means to be in one of these groups.",

My low-income Latina friend said that \"it's really hard find a sense of community here sometimes\" in regards to the Hispanic community, even in things like Mujeres Latinas and LCC. MIT kinda doesn't do so well with the intersectionality (race + income) department if that's important to you. There are definitely Hispanic groups on campus. Ultimately, I just think it depends on what you're looking for.",

In general, I find a stronger presence of Latin Americans (who would not quite self-identify as Hispanics) than Hispanics themselves as they are mostly international students and so seem to be more expressive of their culture or connected to it. You might want to look into the cultural houses at New House or at some of the clubs mentioned in the comments.",

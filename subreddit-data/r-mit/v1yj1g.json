    "postText": "They just announced summer hours for the Student Center. From June 3 to August 14, doors will be unlocked from 6 am to 7 pm. MIT ID holders can get in from 7 pm to 11 pm. After that the building is closed.\n\nFor many years the building was open 24/7. Then you needed a card after 1 am, but an ID still got you in 24 hours. Then 11 pm. Then 9 pm. Now 7 pm, plus total closure overnight. Where is this trend heading?",

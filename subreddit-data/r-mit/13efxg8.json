    "postText": "hi, so I was somehow able to get a 2 Bedroom apartment in Ashdown House on Tuesday. I am actually looking to live in a 3B apartment in Ashdown if in case it is available today. I have not signed my lease agreement yet which expires tomorrow. If there is a 3B apartment available when the portal opens on Thursday, can I change my assignment without paying the $250 penalty, if yes, how?",

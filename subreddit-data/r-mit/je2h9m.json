            "comment": "I love seeing old photos of campus. This is also a nice display of how the althetics complex has evolved over the years. Rockwell Cage is already there. You'd also see the old armory building (du Pont, W31) if you could look to the right. Between Kresge and Rockwell is the old Briggs Fieldhouse (W23), which actually survived until 2002 when the Z-Center was built. The Johnson track/ice rink would come in 1980. The student center also hasn't been built yet, that would come maybe 8 or 9 years after this photo was probably taken, in 1965. You can also see that Cambridge was a very different place last century --a lot of manufacturing and blue-collar industry. The beginning of its shift to high-tech and service industries is just around the corner, though, thanks to the upcoming boom in computers, semiconductors, and biotech.",

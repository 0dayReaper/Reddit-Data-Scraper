Idk how much my stipend will be exactly they said no less that $3500. Can anyone share their experience with efficiency appts and a similar stipend?",

If you would be ok with your own bedroom and sharing common areas with a roommate or two, then there are cheaper options on campus and much cheaper ones off campus.\n\nThere are plenty of students in on campus efficiencies with similar stipends, so it\u2019s definitely manageable. You likely won\u2019t be able to save much money though, if that\u2019s important to you.",

There are also seminars/talks (with food!) and movie nights. I remember watching a mock debate, performed by two students, between Hillary Clinton and Trump in 2016...",

Often much cheaper. Especially if you're willing to be 2-3 miles from campus and bike in instead of walking.\n\nFor example, I live in a 2-bedroom where the total rent is $2200 (I pay $1100), my place is much nicer than living in e.g. Tang, and probably has a nicer kitchen than any on-campus dorm. I live \\~2.5 miles from MIT and it's a very short bike ride to campus.",

In some cases it allows automatic enrollment in online activity signups at MIT or alumni events.\n\nYou can also originate email from the alumni account, though the process is tedious. You have to login to your alumni account and use a send-email text page. Its not a full featured mail browser like gmail. I suspect its tedious in order to prevent people from exploiting an MIT affiliation. I use it when a MIT online event requests you email a gatekeeper for a webinar password. They may deny a random email source, but admit a mit.edu.",

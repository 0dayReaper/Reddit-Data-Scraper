    "postText": "Hey everyone! I'm a junior in undergrad from Toronto, Canada who will be joining MIT in May for one year (May 2022-Apr 2023) as a visiting student researcher in a neuroscience lab. I'll probably be arriving in late April but I've never visited MIT, Cambridge, or Boston before so I'm just looking to meet some new friends here! Also, feel free to share absolutely any tips about restaurants/cafes/shopping/nightlife/literally anything living-related in Boston. I would really appreciate it :)",

I'd recommend visiting outside peak hours when it's less crowded. There is also a house rule against laptop/tablet devices to encourage conversation, but some people ignore them during off-hours (you may be asked to leave during lunch peak and weekends, don't take it personally).\n\nI make the personal decision to not bring devices and it's honestly pretty nice. It's a place to decompress, chat, and just enjoy the day.",

I\u2019m told that CPW is a great time to learn more about student life, academics, talk to current students, and most importantly meet fellow class of 2027 MIT students, so I feel like I\u2019m missing out. How can I still learn about the academics/student life at MIT introduced at CPW and how can I make friends before coming on campus?",

That could help with the first three points you brought up. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s an admitted students discord and/or Facebook group this year, but those would be a way to meet people in the class. Also don\u2019t worry too much, you\u2019ll quickly make friends in your classes and your living group once the semester begins! (Also to make friends before semester begins, highly recommend doing an FPOP.)",

I did mine quite a while ago so idk if this is still the case, but iirc they ask you to rank your top 3 when applying. \n\nI don't think Interphase is competitive but I'm not actually sure. Everyone I know that did it was contacted by OME (Office of Minority Education, which runs the program) to encourage them to apply, and then they got in. They focus on outreach to under-represented minorities and first gen students. If you don't fall into either of those categories, i think you may still be able to apply but it may be harder to get a spot. If you're interested, I recommend looking on their website or even contacting OME directly.",

I'm told Princeton CS grads can't code but MIT CS seems to prepare their ungrads well for industry/PhDs. I've been doing much more humanities than STEM in high school though (academically and extracurricular-wise), so I think I want somewhat of a liberal arts education and that's points for Princeton. Both schools seem to be known for grade deflation but MIT seems more brutal than Princeton, and I'm not sure if I want to spend my entire undergrad life studying in a library. MIT has a better location IMO and Princeton seems preppy, elite, and it looks like there isn't much to do outside of campus (unless I make my way out to NY or Philly). MIT's student body seems more approachable and collaborative, but beyond the surface, they're insane geniuses or just really smart... which is intimidating to think about. I also think MIT students are more involved in academics/research/internships while Princeton has more people engaging with campus clubs and social groups. I'd choose MIT over Princeton any day if not for the grade deflation and insane course rigor, the fact that I don't have too much experience in CS and might fall behind, and that it's less focused on humanities than Princeton.",

And either way, you're going to be coding a LOT. [Here](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/) is one of 5 CS course schedules (the others are on the left sidebar)\n\n&gt;I think I want somewhat of a liberal arts education\n\nYou are required to take 8 humanities classes at MIT (basically, one a semester). And MIT has [an incredibly large selection](https://registrar.mit.edu/registration-academics/academic-requirements/hass-requirement/hass-concentrations) of liberal arts classes &amp; concentrations, so you will get probably a better, more fun, and more varied liberal arts education while at MIT.\n\n&gt;Both schools seem to be known for grade deflation but MIT seems more brutal\n\nNot sure where you got this from. There is no class at MIT with a \"curve\" or anything like that. All MIT classes have exams, homeworks, etc. and if you pass them, you pass the class. Now, if you want to get all A+s, yeah you'll live in a library, but coasting on As &amp; Bs can be done with moderate effort and enough time leftover for having fun.\n\n&gt;MIT has a better location IMO\n\nMIT is very close to Boston, but not in Boston. Just want to temper your expectations: MIT isn't so close like BU or NE, but I assume it's better than Jersey!\n\n&gt;MIT's student body seems more approachable and collaborative\n\nI can say this with extreme confidence: MIT is one of two top universities in the world where there is such a strong collaborative culture. The other is Caltech. It is an incredibly great environment. Obviously there are still some assholes, but that's not the focus\n\n&gt; they're insane geniuses or just really smart... which is intimidating to think about\n\nYeah, you and me both. And everyone else. Almost everyone coming in has imposter syndrome. I won't lie and say it won't be intimidating, but I will say it'll take only a bit of time before those feelings will go away!\n\nAnd there's no presumption of genius coming in: most of your classes your first year will be intro coding classes &amp; physics, math fundamentals. Half of it will be a refresher, and the other half will be building up on it in a really challenging but fun way. So you're not \"already behind\" because the first class you'll take, and what &gt;HALF the freshman take is an intro to python class. \n\n&gt;MIT students are more involved in academics/research/internships \n\nVery true. Meeting people not from MIT has been wild, because apparently having a job every summer isn't normal in other places. And doing research during the school year is apparently rare elsewhere. MIT is great for that.\n\n&gt;Princeton has more people engaging with campus clubs and social groups\n\nAt MIT, there are more kids in social clubs and groups than there are on academic teams or doing research. Singing, dancing, hiking, gaming, almost anything you want to do is available here. And if you want to start a club (I started two! both fizzled out though after I left), it's super easy to start a club! That's why there are so many.\n\nSo, you sum up that you'd choose MIT over princeton if not for:\n\n* Grade Deflation (false)\n* Insane course rigor (true)\n* Fall behind in CS (very false)\n* Less humanity focus (very false)\n\nGiven my above answers, hopefully the labels of false I gave make sense. I think MIT is the right place for you!",

    "postText": "I found out by looking at my transcript today on the registrar website. I was assigned grades of \u201cI\u201d and \u201cO\u201d for classes I thought I had dropped.\n\nApparently I had gotten approval for dropping them by submitting a form, but I was not aware I needed to submit a second form to actually drop?\n\nSorry, this was my first semester so this process was confusing to me. Has anyone been thru this? Is my transcript screwed?",

You will need to explain that you forgot to confirm the drop after your advisor approved it, and that you did not attempt any assignments after the drop date. It comes with a $50 fee but other than that the process is straightforward.\n\nAlso I'd suggest reaching out directly to your advisor for things like this in the future. They are the best resource for such queries.",

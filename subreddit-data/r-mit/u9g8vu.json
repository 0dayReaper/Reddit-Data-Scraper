    "postText": "I'm contemplating going to grad school at MIT. It's an incredible opportunity and it's been a dream school for me. I graduated 2 years ago from an undergrad at a public school, and currently work in big tech. I'm worried about the two year opportunity cost of attending grad school. I feel like I can become a senior engineer in those 2 years vs going to MIT and not making any money for 2 years + taking on insane amounts of debt. How did people deal with this thought? Any advice for me?",

There are a lot of reasons to want to learn more. Do you *want* to be a senior engineer in 2 years? If so you know how to get there. If your goals involve something you don\u2019t believe you have the tools to do, and grad school would give you those tools, then it might be worth it. \n\nIf your goal is just to be an MIT alum, it\u2019s almost certainly not worth it.",

If you are looking at more science or math heavy areas like data science, ai, comp biology etc.  then the advanced degree is worth it and I would agree as a former MIT undergrad and PhD that in those fields the PhD is the way to go.  For general programming and not specific things like quantum crypto or systems etc.  You can learn more in industry.  So in summary I would think about how far on the research edge do you want to be.",

            "comment": "Graduate students in science and engineering generally are paid a stipend to attend, and tuition is covered by either research grants, fellowships, or something else.  A small number of people pay their own way, depending on the field and department.  Most (probably 80-90 percent in engineering departments) are connected up to a research project sponsored by the U.S. Government or an industrial partner.  The stipend is poor, but (barely) sufficient to live in Boston.  You will likely incur no additional debt.\n\nThe question is what is your goal?  PhDs tend to end up being researchers or consultants in academia or industry, teaching and/or conducting independent research.  You sound like you want a Master's degree, which can add to your qualifications for an industry position consulting or working on big engineering problems, and the degree will likely make you attractive to a new layer of companies doing exciting work, but maybe you already have that?\n\nThere's a few other second tier draws; professors at MIT are very well connected in their field, which will open some more doors for you.  The research topic itself can be very interesting (and you should look for (a) professor(s) whose work excites you before even applying), but you will effectively only have a couple of years to work on that research topic (unless you continue in a PhD program and/or connect with the sponsor of the research or another organization also doing the same work) and that can actually be frustrating to some people.\n\nEvery field is a bit different, and I'm specifically working in one of the engineering departments, where what I type here holds most true.  You should do some homework to verify this in the field of your choice.  \n\nI can't emphasize this enough though; if you get into a MS or PhD program at MIT look for the specific professors you think are doing what you want to study, find out as much as you can about them, and when you find a fit try to get into their specific labs as early as possible in the process.  A good fit in research area, personality, and management style of these people can make a huge difference between an excellent experience and a poor one.",

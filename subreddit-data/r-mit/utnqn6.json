    "postText": "Hello everyone. I will be attending a summer program at Harvard GSD in July and I'm currently looking for housing. I've heard MIT frats lease their space over the summer, but on their websites it says for the whole summer and I was wondering if anyone might know if they're flexible? (I'm only staying for the month of July). Otherwise might anyone know where else to look? I've been looking at Facebook so far. Any help is greatly appreciated!",

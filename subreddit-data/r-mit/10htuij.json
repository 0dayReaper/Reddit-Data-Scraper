    "postText": "I am a masters student in EE graduating this spring with a job offer at a well known semiconductor company working in Analog/Mixed signal design work. I applied to MIT with several other schools last fall for EE. Theoretically, if I was accepted into MIT EE PhD, would it be worth it to do the PhD instead of working instead - hoping to hear from some current PhDs or maybe some alum who have done circuit design positions.\n\nFor context, I think doing research sounds interesting, but work also sounds cool to me. I don't have a goal to become a professor, but I think working in industry research could be interesting. I like taking classes, learning more, and wouldn't mind focusing on a field, but I think I would also get to do a lot of that (except taking classes) at a job. Hopefully some of you can give me insight on whether or not you think it is \"worth it\" if I am on the fence about it. I have asked a similar question in the \"chip design\" subreddit and the answer was overwhelmingly to choose working over PhD, but I would like to hear the MIT student/alum side of it as well.\n\nThank you :)",

Say your Ph.D. takes 5 years, that's close to half a million bucks you are forgoing. \n\nMoney isn't everything, but think about what you'd do with 5 years of work experience under your belt where you will still be learning loads etc if you push yourself AND you have enough for a potential downpayment on something like a home. \n\nBasically getting a Ph.D. sounds super cool and glorious, but it sometimes makes you less employable, particularly if you take a long time getting your doctorate. I had a project, funding, and was pushed to finsih quickly, so it was a no-brainer for me, but i also had zero interest in academia. \n\nHaving a Ph.D. from MIT in industry puts a target on your back - you're supposed to be an expert in something and be able to dive deep into topics and really take over a certain area of research or of a project. People will come after you because of their own reasons, but just be prepared to have a more difficult time due to your expanded expertise in a field. \n\nBasically, don't get it for the name. It's a waste of time, but if you really want to do academia and you're passionate about it (get in line behind the 300 other people applying for the same position), then go for it i guess. Else, go get your job and start life. Spending 5 years grueling in school is not worth it for a few letters.",

I.e it\u2019s mostly about learning how to run a research project and managing advisors (committee members) efficiently to leverage their expertise to help you. \n\nNo Ph.D. From any prof is an express pass to anything\u2026. It may give you a bit of a leg up, but that\u2019s entirely on the student and their skill-set/personality. \n\nIf you have a good topic it\u2019ll certainly be helpful, but what you get out of a Ph.D. Isn\u2019t so much your advisor\u2019s credibility but rather what you put into your own education.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the financial incentives of industry as well, which are arguably the biggest ones, particularly when Ph.D. rarely give you an actual leg up for any managerial positions.  \n\nI\u2019m not telling OP to not get a Ph.D., I\u2019m giving them some actual things to think about as I saw too many people just getting one because they thought it\u2019s what they should be doing rather than because they actually *wanted* to be there and understood what they were getting into.",

I chose to go industry after PhD and I've gained a ton of experience as a result.\n\nIf you want to do chip design and already have an open offer to do design with a company, I say go for industry!\n\nOftentimes it can be hard to get a design role without a PhD depending on company, so that's often a factor for why people go the PhD route. If you can bypass that and get more experience, it's all the better, imo.",

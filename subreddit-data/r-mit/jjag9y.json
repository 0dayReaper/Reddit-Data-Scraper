That will bring up a horrendously large banner that tells people if they are thinking of visiting that they should read the wiki instead of posting their stupid narcissistic visitor questions. We should get one of those.\n\nI also propose adding to the sub rules that if you post admissions questions they will be banned for some period of time...\n\nThat being said, are questions about applying to Lincoln Lab considered admissions questions? It kind of is, but not really since some students work there in a UROP like capacity.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI thought I would pass along a [Github repo](https://github.com/malekinho8/mit-meche-class-info) that I hope can be a good resource for MIT MechE students (particularly graduate students). In it, you will find insider info about classes, professors, and other useful tips that students might not know about. I find that it can be very difficult to find useful tips and info about classes at MIT besides the course evaluations, which don't really give you all that much. Feel free to peruse what information I've put in there so far, and if you have any other useful notes you want to add, feel free to make a PR!",

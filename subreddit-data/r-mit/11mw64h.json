The **single** difference between pro-lifers and pro-choicers is that the former category thinks the government should have the right to deny a woman the ability to choose to get an abortion if she deems it personally necessary, and the pro-choicers believe that women should actually have fucking bodily autonomy instead of being turned into unwilling incubators.\n\n**Anyone who argues other definitions of pro-lifers is worthless and deliberately muddying the waters.**",

            "comment": "To the fundamentally worthless pieces of shit defending this group in these comments:\n\nThe right to bodily autonomy is fundamentally more important than the right to free speech (for reasons that should be obvious unless you're waaaaaaaay too stupid to have gotten into MIT, which means I am forced to assume you're arguing in bad faith if you disagree--but for those who **are** stupid enough to disagree, ask yourself why direct threats of death and violence **aren't** protected speech). The right to autonomy over one's own body is literally the most inalienable right of all.\n\n**Further**, cries of \"censorship\" by people aiming to shout down and drown out these worthless anti-woman groups are fundamentally misguided in the first place, because I am not--and you are not--the government. We cannot be responsible for \"censorship\". You can argue that the government should allow this speech (though I disagree wholeheartedly, for the same reason physical threats of violence are illegal instead of being covered under \"protected speech\", threats against a collective group's right to bodily autonomy should genuinely just be illegal as well, but they aren't, primarily because of fucking religion), but someone tearing down the posters of a group dedicated to such a horrific goal isn't \"censoring\" them, they are in fact exercising their **own** freedom of speech by doing so.\n\nDisingenuous fucks. If you think someone has the right to \"debate\" women's bodily autonomy, that means you don't **believe** in women's bodily autonomy. Some things aren't worth debating because the baseline is far too fundamental to be allowed into the public discourse. That goes out to all of you stupid young-adult internet libertarians--if you think allowing generational slavery and genocide are valid topics of political debate, congrats, you're self-consistent but **also a fucking sociopath**. If you think those two topics \"aren't comparable\" to abortion, congrats, you **just proved my point that you do not believe in women's bodily autonomy**.\n\nEdit: just because a position is \"normalized\" doesn't mean it's \"okay\". Case in point: slavery (again).\n\nEdit 2: if you downvote please also comment so I know who the fundamentally worthless pieces of shit are :)",

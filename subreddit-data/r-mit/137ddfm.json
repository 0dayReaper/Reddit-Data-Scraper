We're all about helping students find their way in a new environment, and we'd love to have more students like you on board to share your experiences and insights.\n\nWe're looking for people who can:\n\nQuickly review essays for content\nShare constructive feedback on essays\nOffer guidance on students' activities\n\nIn return, we're offering $35 per hour and a flexible schedule that works around your commitments. Plus, we'll pay you in advance for any projects you take on.\n\nWe believe that by working together, we can make a real difference for these students. If you're interested in joining our team, feel free to drop me a DM, and we can set up a meeting to discuss this further and answer any questions you might have.\n\nLooking forward to potentially working with some of you and making an impact together!\n\nCheers,\nLiam",

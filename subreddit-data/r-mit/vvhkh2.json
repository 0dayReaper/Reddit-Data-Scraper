I feel like if I lived closer I'd be tempted to go home and tell myself I'd return to campus. It keeps work and home separated. Also there are some things you can do on the T like reading. For me, it came down to finding a reasonably priced apartment with lots of room so that pushed me further out to Somerville",

Most of the homeless people I\u2019ve seen, and I see them all day and all night because they camp in droves right underneath my apartment window, are violent towards each other and disruptive. They poop and pee on the doorway my building and leave needles around. I live right across from the Target so it\u2019s impossible to avoid them. After being catcalled, shoved to the ground with bruises, mugged, had gross men making comments about what kind of sex they want to have with me, pulling out their penises and masturbating in front of me, I\u2019m not interested in your evaluation of my experiences. I live right by the Cambridge library, so the Mecca of Methadone. And prostitutes and needles. People lying in the middle of Pearl Street, drugged out of their minds.\n\nThat\u2019s not just uwu uncomfortable and I didn\u2019t ask for someone to basically mansplain how to exist as a woman in a shitty part of a (very nice) town \ud83d\ude29 stop trying to tell me how good it is when it\u2019s been very stressful and miserable for more than a year. I\u2019ve talked about it in other Reddit posts and you can go read those if you\u2019re so inclined. Otherwise I\u2019m just beyond sick of talking about it. It already sucked having to go through cops, therapy when I was attacked..",

There are enough super aggressive homeless people over there for it to frankly just not fucking matter if most of them are harmless. \n\nI have also been followed home and threatened, and on multiple occasions thought I was going to have to deal with a violent altercation. So congrats on your fortunate experience of Central Square, dude, but people who don\u2019t know the area should know it\u2019s not a safe place to live.",

They learned to stop being pushy! Haha!",

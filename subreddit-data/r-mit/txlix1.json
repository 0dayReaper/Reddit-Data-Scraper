I usually end up studying less for tests so I can finish my PSETs. Has anyone else solved this problem? What can I do to get more time or work more efficiently without sleeping less?",

MIT is really good at teaching us how to connect, dive deep and solve problems. It's not always the best at setting personal boundaries. And if you don't learn how to set boundaries, the working world certainly won't teach you how. \n\nNow being about 10 years out, I see a lot of my friends priorities shift after being burned out not knowing how to set boundaries. Losing sleep over a test is fine when you get spring break or summer. But work will not have those natural cadence to give you relief. If you don't learn to set boundaries and are prone to burn out, it won't really get better after school.",

Just know when to stop grinding your gears and go ask for help. Be reasonable and fair to yourself.",

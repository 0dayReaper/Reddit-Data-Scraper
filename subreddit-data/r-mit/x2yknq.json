    "postText": "I'm a researcher at MIT NSE / PSFC and have permission to audit 22.63 and 22.074 from their respective instructors. The issue is both these classes are Tuesday Thursday and run 1-2:30 and 2:30-4 consecutively. I haven't taken classes at MIT before and am curious if this is doable. The walk between classes is about 6 min.\n\nDo lectures usually go for the whole 1:30? The first class is a graduate level class and the second is  undergraduate level. I really want to take both these classes  :(",

Also, with regards to the \u201cfull 1:30\u201d question, most classes will take the full time, especially the undergraduate ones. The good news is that with the 5minute late start, 5 minute early end, and usually a break (the nice professors make it 5 minutes), the lecture is only about 1:15 worth of content.",

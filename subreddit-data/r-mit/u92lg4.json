Is there anything really important to know/anything you wish you knew about Macgregor house before making a decision on whether to put it first?",

            "comment": "I am a Macgregor alum! It is a great place to live, suite style is the best and there is huge cultural diversity between entries. Most of my current closest friends I met at Macgregor house. \nThe only things I didn\u2019t like about it were the kitchens are really small, very little counter space. There\u2019s no air conditioning. And one thing I had to get used to was that every bathroom is unisex but they have urinals.\nAnother quirky thing is that the elevators make no sense, they go to every 3 floors. So I got used to walking up stairs a lot which was probably good for me anyway but very bizarre.\nIf I had to do it again, I\u2019d definitely pick Macgregor first. I had an amazing view of the river, the best suite mates, and my own private space that was all mine.",

This was back in the early 2000s but I imagine they still exist.  So yeah if the shared bathroom thing weirds you out (like me) there are probably options still!",

One thing that might be important is that it is a bit older/less renovated than some of the other dorms, if that matters to you (although that hasn't really been an issue at all for me this year).\n\nAnother thing is that the amenities are quite nice -- the gym is bigger than most dorms' gyms, the game room is really nice (esp for watching movies with groups), and I find the study room to also be really well designed/furnished.",

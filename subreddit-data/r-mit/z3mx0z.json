            "comment": "IIRC car insurance rates in MA are regulated, so for the same coverage the price should be the same. The only non-negligible difference is then customer service. \n\nWhen I was a grad student, i used GEICO and it was fine. In many states, GEICO is able to offer appreciably lower rates than traditional ones, but in MA that is not the case. \n\nLater on i switched to MAPFRE / Commerce via an agency that a friend recommended, to get umbrella insurance. https://www.aldengoldsmith.com/\n\nSo far I've been very happy with them, they respond quickly and they explain things simply. \n\nIf you are a grad student i suggest you look at property insurance for renters, the coverage is really good. I know many have benefited from coverage against bike theft, pedestrian accidents, property theft, etc.",

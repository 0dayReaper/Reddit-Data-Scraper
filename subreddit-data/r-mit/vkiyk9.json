    "postText": "Hello, so I will be applying to MIT this fall, and in my supplemental essays, I would like to mention that I hope to major in science, tech, society(STS). My ec's and interests are split evenly between science and the humanities and I think this major is a good fit for my interests. My question is, is STS more of a  science-y kind of degree or more on the humanities side? Since MIT is mainly known for stem, I am rather worried if the admissions office will look down on me for my humanities interests.. like is it normal for prospective MIT seniors to apply as humanities majors? I know STS is exactly strict humanities like english, history but I am still rather worried. Is there anything I should know about the STS major when talking about it in my supps? Any current STS majors on this sub?\n\nAnd I was looking at this link about the major- [https://sts-program.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate/major/](https://sts-program.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate/major/). I don't really understand what it means.. can you only study STS as a second major? \n\nSorry for all of the questions. Thanks for your help.",

I thinking pitching a love for STEM as well as humanities well really serve your application well!",

Applying as a hum major with genuine interest in the humanities probably helps you stand out. I also expressed interest in the STS program (though as a secondary interest); didn\u2019t say much that was too specific to the program though.",

Solo-majoring in STS is exceedingly rare, double majoring is more common. Your application will still have to sing to all the STEM priorities that embodies MIT (maxing out AP sciences, near perfect quant scores, deep commitment and achievements with extracurriculars, etc.) DM me if you have more questions.",

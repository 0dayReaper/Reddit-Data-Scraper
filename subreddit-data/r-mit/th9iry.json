    "postText": "I don't know if this post fits the sub etiquette, I hope it's okay. Anyway I have been enjoying MIT operncourseware for a while, and I am really impressed by the quality of instructors, not to speak about the generosity of putting it all on the internet for free. One course that caught my attention was the Putnam seminar (18.A34 ) on mathematical problem solving. It looks like a really amazing course! However, there are only problem sets without solutions and no other material. \n\nI don't know if the school policy allows to share more than what OCW already shares, but in case you can share it, does somebody have more material (lecture recording/notes, PSs with solutions, etc.)? Thank you in advance!",

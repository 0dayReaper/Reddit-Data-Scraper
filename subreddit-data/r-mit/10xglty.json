            "comment": "It\u2019s not easy, but I found it to be absolutely worth it. Although sports does take up time, it gives you two very tangible benefits towards your well being (besides the physical health that comes from being active). First, you get a reliable social group as soon as you arrive on campus. Second, having a solid commitment in your schedule every day can do wonders for keeping yourself in a rhythm/routine when it comes to your academic work. I knew people who quit my sport and immediately started doing WORSE in classes, because they fell out of their regiment. \n\nIf the sport has only one primary competition season, then you can also manipulate your academic schedule a bit to take advantage of this, taking harder classes in the off-season. Dual sport athletes or sports with competitive seasons in both fall and spring don\u2019t have that luxury, but I found it wasn\u2019t necessary.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t recruited, you owe nothing to the team/coaching staff of course, but if I were you, I\u2019d give it a shot for the first year. After that, you can judge off your own experience.",

Having to be up at 6am 5 days a week did force me to plan ahead and go to sleep at a reasonable time each night.\n\nI still had time for a 5+ hour a week extra curricular and time to hang out with friends.",

            "comment": "I was on the rowing team at MIT, and we practiced 15-20 hours a week during both fall and spring semesters. I had a hard time balancing athletics, academics, socializing, and sleep my first semester, but that was mostly because we had 6:30 am practices and I kept staying up super late to hang out with people -- after freshman fall I got more serious about my classes &amp; my sport, started making friends on my team, and started balancing things better.\n\nDoing a sport motivated me to adopt a healthy sleep schedule and good nutrition, and generally enforced structure in my life, which helped me a lot at MIT. MIT undergrad can get pretty chaotic, and it was good for me to have a reason to go to bed at a reasonable time and not take more than 5 classes per semester. \n\nI also made a lot of friends on my team, and as a freshman/sophomore I would pset with the other underclassmen on my team and I would also sometimes get academic help from older teammates. Rowing helped me both academically and socially, and it also definitely helped my mental health by providing a break from the grind of MIT.\n\nAlso, I was lucky to have really good coaches. I appreciated having real adults in my life who cared enough to say things like \"you look like death, go home and get some rest\" whenever someone would try to come to practice on 3 hours of sleep. It's easy to push yourself too hard at MIT, and it's important to have people who genuinely care about your well-being looking out for you.\n\nTLDR; I agree with everyone else; I would recommend doing your sport for at least your first year. At that point, you'll know if you like it and if it's worth continuing",

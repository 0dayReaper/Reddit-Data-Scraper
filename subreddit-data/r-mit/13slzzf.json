    "postText": "Somewhat copying my post over from the Harvard sub but I just graduated and moved to Boston recently and was planning on visiting MIT this weekend to take some photographs and explore the campus. Was wondering if you guys could recommend some of the spots on campus with the best architecture in your opinion, or really any cool visually-pleasing buildings. I will be sure not to disturb any students at all.\n\nIs there an official tour where they show some buildings I otherwise wouldn't be able to get into? Appreciate any recommendations you guys got, and if any of you are free to offer a tour on Saturday that would be pretty great \ud83e\udd79",

    "postText": "hi guys, i got waitlisted by mit on pi day and since then have written and submitted a letter of continued interest, as it has been my dream school since i knew what college even was. i wanted to know if anyone here knows someone who has gotten admitted off the waitlist, and if so, if they have any advice on getting off the waitlist, ie additional things i can do/submit. also, my grades have fallen a fair amount since i got waitlisted (from 4.0 freshman-jr year to 2 Bs first sem snr yr to 3 Bs and 1 C currently, the C is in ap gov). how will this impact my chances of getting off the waitlist? thanks so much!!",

It might be time to move on, but I promise it's all good. Regardless of what people will tell you, you can get an experience on par with what MIT has to offer at many schools across the country. Best of luck!",

Also if you're worried about acceptance rate, you can look at the difference between class of '26 and '27. '27 has fewer admitted because of the EC renovations, but a higher acceptance rate than '26 because applications are coming down from Covid",

Not that it mattered anyways don't think I had any actual skills freshman fall). \n\nHow do I actually get my resume seen and get an interview. Should I reach out to alumni at these companies on LinkedIn and speak with them? Ask upperclassmen I know personally for referrals? \n\nor maybe it is not a crapshoot and if you have a very good/meta resume, then even if you apply normally you will at least get the the assessment/interview. I would love any advice/enlightenment that any of you have to offer!",

They'll help you through absolutely everything you ever need, however, as you become a junior/senior you'll realize that CAP is quite limited in finding you full-time and graduate opportunities, but for a freshman/sophomore they're literally going to be God for you! You'll outgrow them eventually but for now reach out and make as many appointments as you can: career advice, mock behavioral interview, and resume advice. They're going to help you way more than any redditor here.\n\nIf you do want advice from some random person, here goes: there's no secret to getting an internship. Go to the career fairs, talk extensively to every recruiter and make an impression. They're the ones getting your application to be seen, and only on the basis of if you were interesting in some way.\n\nDo not reach out to random alumni. People you know? Sure, but if you messaged me on LinkedIn I'd ignore you because I don't know you. MIT is big, I can't help out a random frosh who messages me. \n\nBut do reach out to recruiters on LinkedIn, when you meet people at info sessions and career fairs, connect with them. Just keep being extroverted until someone likes you. That's all there is to it.",

People from your same floor/FSILG/club are fair game, not just bff\u2019s- a referral bonus is a referral bonus so I\u2019ve never heard of someone being annoyed unless their company limited the number of referrals you could hand out.\n\nThat said I got my job at a startup with the help of an alum I had never met after asking for an informational interview / coffee chat.",

I've never really actually understood what the results of making a good impression on a recruiter looks like. Do they directly offer you interviews/tell the people who send out interview invitations about candidates they like?",

Every company is different, sometimes the recruiters will tell you before you leave their booth that they're going to reach out to your email, and others will have to consult first with their team.\n\nJust make sure you have contact info on your resume!",

The MIT police have footage of that area but refuse to help. If anybody sees a 2022 Genuine Roughouse please reach out. Also be careful of any crime in that area.\n\nEdit: Picture of bike here https://imgur.com/a/nPyTopk. Please report if spotted\n\nUpdate: MIT police rocks!! They found it",

Call [Cambridge Police](https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/cambridgepolice/iwantto/fileapolicereport/) tomorrow morning. You\u2019d like to report a motor-vehicle theft. *Incident location: Broadway, Broad Canal Way, Third St, or other city street.*\n2. When the report car shows up, mention the Ashdown House footage. Ask that a detective request a courtesy copy.\n3. Send [Chief DiFava](https://police.mit.edu/contact#block-views-directory-block) a friendly heads-up.\n4. If needed, [Senator DiDomenico](https://malegislature.gov/Legislators/Profile/SND0/) (Middlesex/Suffolk) will be happy to follow up with the Commissioner as a constituent service.\n\n\u2013James Herms (MtE \u201987), Democratic ward committee member, Cambridge Ward 5",

The garage caught everything on camera but will not share it with me as I am not a cop. I'm not even sure if they have looked at the footage as they won't return my calls, do you have any advice for how to navigate this?",

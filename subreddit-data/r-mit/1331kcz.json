I stop work at midnight, and I'm eligible to graduate early after switching my major sophomore year. I aim for 7-8 hours a night and the only thing that keeps me from doing that is staying up to talk to friends. \n\nI also think MIT with it's cloudy Boston weather and perpetually-stressed-leaning student body is an easy place to feel trapped in a bubble of endless work, but that's why it's important to involve yourself in something that isn't just classwork to keep from sinking into it. Finding health ways to cope with negative feelings can help decrease the effects of sadness and stress on your life and health. You don't have to depressed and stressed here, despite what others say.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you wanna discuss more. I really don't think it's necessary to have a miserable time at MIT.",

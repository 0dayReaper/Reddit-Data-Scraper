    "postText": "I am currently planning on becoming a Visiting Student at a lab here for quite some time, but I realize that there are not many posts about it on this subreddit. I also do not know how to contact any other undergraduate from the specific lab I am going to, so I am asking this place for general information.\n\nCan anyone tell me what their experience was about this program, or something very close to it? I am interested in seeing what this will be about, considering how great this opportunity is.",

Visiting students cannot take classes except as listeners (requires permission of th instructor and no grade will be entered), they are treated as researchers in most labs I\u2019ve seen and are expected to work like its a job in the lab (or equivalent).  Some departments provide offices, others don\u2019t, some consider them full blown members of the community, others not so much.  Some use the program to attract new grad students, others as a pool of cheap labor.  You should have as an understanding a regular meeting with your supervisor, attendance at group meetings, and a \u201cmentor\u201d or two of some kind, typically a graduate student in the lab.  You should have some plan from your arrival from the hosts for getting oriented quickly and trained so you are engaged in lab work quickly.",

Sometimes students reach out to faculty on their own just because they really want to work with them, and sometimes they're students recommended by their home institution supervisors, e.g., the supervisor is collaborating with an MIT professor, and thinks that it would be a benefit for both if a particular student comes to MIT to work on a project of mutual interest.\n\nThere are also financial considerations on both sides that I won't go into here, and if you're an international student, you'll want to make sure the appointment process gets started well before you plan to come to MIT. If you have a faculty person who's already expressed a willingness to host you for a time, but they're not clear on the details (i.e., most of them!), ask to be e-introduced to the administrative assistant for the group. It's their job to help with this kind of thing.",

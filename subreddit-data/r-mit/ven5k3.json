Theres also widgets to help explain concepts\n\n\nIn my opinion it's a much better \"online learning experience\" as opposed to 1 hr lectures.\n\n\nIt is technically available on OCW (listed as 18.01C) but you have to open everything through links instead of clicking the next button and it just works better on MITX.\n\nWhat I would do is learn on MITx while following the corresponding page on OCW and then when I see  a pset on OCW i'd do that before continuing. Because on MITX the psets are missing.",

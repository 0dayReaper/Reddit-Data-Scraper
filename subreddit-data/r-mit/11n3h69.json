In middle school there were two asians, and of course they referred to us as brothers even though we didn't even know each other. In high school there was a diversity jump, but still the asian population was about 7. MIT was not only a shift in demographics but also in culture. There was a much bigger emphasis, appreciation, but also normalization, of being geeky. There are a lot of asian culture clubs which embrace the things a lot of immigrant kids grew up with, but learned to to hide (or lost) in school. There's a general sense of acceptance for diversity that really opened my eyes when i got there.",

I think a lot of it is Chinese, but I've also met quite a few Vietnamese people. There is also a Vietnamese Student Association that I've seen sending emails advertising events, but I've never personally interacted with them. Being Asian at MIT is so different compared to being Asian somewhere that is primarily not-Asian. I have a lot more in common in terms of my experience with my family, food, and growing up with Asian parents at MIT than I did in Missouri and I haven't experienced anti-Asian rhetoric on-campus from students or staff. \n\nHowever, Boston is a slightly different because it's still a city and I've had a couple of instances of racism, but usually those people are kinda generally belligerent towards everyone. The vast majority of time nothing happens.",

If they need assistance flying into town, they may be able to get it if they disclose that.\nAt CPW they will have a chance to engage the MIT community, meet students in their entering class,  and be right there in the city of Cambridge.\n\nHave them do this today.",

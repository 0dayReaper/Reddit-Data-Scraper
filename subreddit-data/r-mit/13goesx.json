    "postText": "MIT administration continues to try and push for the current contract, but misses a few key details. \n\nThe contributors of CPI for graduate students tends to be different from the contributors to CPI of the general population. Graduate students are disproportionately affected by the rising cost of food and shelter (7.7% and 8.1%, respectively), but disproportionately unaffected by the falling cost of gasoline and used cars (-12.2% and -6.6%, respectively). (Only 4% of graduate students drive)[https://ir.mit.edu/commuting-2021]. Moreover, the cost of living in Boston/Cambridge has increased more rapidly than the national average, where (average rent in Cambridge has increased by 15% YoY)[https://bostonpads.com/blog/boston-rental-market/2023-cambridge-apartment-rental-market-report/]. Unlike what MIT's administration argues, CPI does not adequately represent the increase in cost of living for MIT graduate students. \n\nMIT further continues to argue against a union shop, essentially kneecapping the negotiating power of MIT's graduate student union for further raises in the future. **Note that the rest of MIT's staff work for unions with union shop clauses.** The lack of union shop creates a free rider problem that sows discord between union and non-union employees.  Moreover, the lack of union shop incentivizes MIT to oppose employees looking to join the union, creating a perverse incentive structure for MIT. \n\nMIT administration is arguing from a position of bad faith in their attempt to minimize compensation for graduate students and maximize gains on their endowment. We can do better.",

            "comment": "Could you please talk through the question about the union shop?\n\nFrom my uninformed point of view, it seems like a good union would be able to earn support, such that people would choose to join it because it's doing a good job. Why should people be forced to join the union, in the event that the union is doing a bad job of representing the students' interests? It just feels like by pushing so hard for union shop, the union gets to say \"You're going to join and you are GONNA LIKE IT.\" Why can't the union earn support rather than mandating it?\n\nI also don't feel great about the fact that the vote is only open to people who have joined the union. Seems like that would skew the sample size. People end up in a catch-22. If you're opposed to being forced into the union, the only way you can vote and voice that opinion is to... join the union. Doesn't it seem dishonest for the union to get to limit the voter pool like this? I'm not making a claim one way or the other, and would love to be educated by someone who understands the situation better than I do.\n\nI'm also not clear on whether it's sketchy for the union to be allowing fellows to vote, given that, as things stand now, they have been disqualified from union membership. I know the union is disputing that, but like, you don't get to follow a rule that you're actively trying to install, prior to it being installed, right? The NLRB has made their ruling and I don't get how the union can just give them the middle finger.\n\nFinally, I'm curious what transparency there is in the structure of this election. Seems like the union is running it, and the union has a very clearly established opinion. How do we know that the votes they count are actually the votes people submitted? Is there an external neutral auditor overseeing the process?",

Every RA and TA, member or not, will receive the pay scale in the contract, will be able to file a grievance and ask the union to go to bat for them, etc. There is no way to opt out of this under labor law.\n\nSince everyone has to be protected, the idea behind union shop is that everyone should also contribute. It\u2019s like local emergency services: think of the fire the department.\n\nWe all pay local taxes so that a well staffed and well maintained fire truck arrives if our house is on fire.\n\nUnder an open shop, the only benefit that members (those who pay dues) receive that non-members (pay nothing) don\u2019t is voting rights. Paying members would get to pay.\n\nSo open shop is a fire department that runs on donations where those who donate get to elect the new fire chief. That now very poorly funded fire department still has to protect the whole town. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that unfortunately a lot of people will make the bet that there won\u2019t be a fire, so a well staffed fire department isn\u2019t required. And if what MIT said they wanted in that last email we\u2019re to come to pass (everyone gets to vote), then paying members wouldn\u2019t even get special voting privileges. There would be zero benefits afforded to those who pay dues that non-dues paying individuals don\u2019t also receive. The union would *literally* be running on donations.\n\nAnd in this analogy, MIT is fire. They would like a weak fire department.\n\nAlso, to be clear, signing a union card does not require you pay dues at this time. Nobody pays dues until we have a contract. And nothing can ever be automatically deducted from your paycheck without what\u2019s called a dues check off card.",

I'd really appreciate if you could go into more detail on some of your points, because as they stand, I'm not sure how convincing they are.\n\n&gt; Over time the union would fall apart due to lack of membership, putting all the control in MIT's hands\n\nIf a union contract is formed and adopted, then the union represents the bargaining unit. Even if there are 10,000 grad students, and the union has 7 members, those 7 get to bargain for all 10,000 and the union retains its power. The only way the union would lose power is if the people in the bargaining unit held a new vote and decided that they no longer wished to be represented by the union. Given that the GSC has historically represented graduate students in a way that is satisfactory to most (but certainly has had issues, which some have seen as more egregious than others), there will presumably always be some fraction of students who are interested in active participation in bargaining with MIT and therefore I don't see how a reduced number of people signing up for the union is a problem. The union represents ALL the members of the bargaining group, regardless of who is a member and who is not. The point of becoming a member is that it allows you to have a say in the union's decisions, as far as I understand it. The union is going to bargain for you - and it is up to you whether you trust it to make its own choices, or if you want to be able to steer it in a particular direction (But correct me if that's wrong).\n\n&gt;No one is ever forced to join the union; even under union shop you can opt out of the union, you'd just have to pay bargaining fees instead.\n\nWhile this is true, it's quite misleading. Imagine you were taking a class and the professor said on day one \"Here's the textbook for the class! I wrote it, and you are required to buy a copy. I'll be checking your receipts! The book costs $100 from all retailers. For those students who are opposed to this policy where I get to force you all to pay me $100 for the book, I understand where you're coming from - if you do not want to buy the book, you can pay me $100 as a Book Exemption Fee and I will not require you to buy the book\".\n\nBut like, that's kind of BS. I have to pay either way, it's just whether I'm paying in exchange for something (buying the book), or paying, and having nothing to show for it. To put it another way, under open shop, each worker gets to make a choice, as with any purchase. The new Zelda game came out last week - and it's up to me whether I want to A) Pay $70 and play the game or B) keep my $70, because the game isn't worth that much to me. In open shop, I can decide whether union membership is a product I want to purchase. Both options have their upsides and their downsides - I can pick whether I want membership, or to save money. In union shop, the union gives me two options. I can A) Pay dues and have membership or B) pay bargaining fees (equal to dues) and not have membership. Who is the union offering Option B to? Under what circumstances would it be in a person's interest to pay the same amount and get a strictly inferior product? In open shop, both options have a reasonable argument. Either you say you want representation (long-term, more ability to bargain for higher pay) or you say you want to keep your money (short-term, no expenditure for dues). But what is the reasonable argument for a person to choose not to join the union in union shop? My point in these questions is that every time I hear someone saying \"You don't have to join, even in union shop! There's an alternative option!\", but this feels like a fake option which is not a realistic offer which has any compelling merits. It feels like they're offering an illusion of choice to make it sound like they aren't strongarming people into something. Am I misunderstanding something here?\n\n&gt;A union card is simply a form stating that you authorize the GSU to bargain on your behalf.\n\nI am not willing to authorize them to do that when there is no contract yet. They can bargain for me once they are in power, but I'm not going to relinquish my own bargaining power prior to the union representing everyone.\n\n&gt;I get where you're coming from but strongly disagree on this! MIT's emails are written by professional comms people who do a damn good job of adding a lot of spin. \n\nIs that not the case for the union? When I was questioning the choice to align with UE (rather than being our own tailor-made independent union just for MIT graduate students), the argument was that UE has resources such as legal staff, communications experts, etc. Does UE not have comms people spinning their emails? I've seen just as many inflammatory messages from the union. Their most recent emails have even been saying that by not supporting union shop, MIT is \"placing themselves in the dubious company of ... employers who have pushed racist \"right-to-work\" legistlation\". They're accusing MIT of being aligned with racists (without actually arguing where the link comes from or why the legislation is racist). I'm not going to say that this legislation has never been associated with racism, but this is a strong accusation to make that it is always racist in nature. My point is, let's not accuse MIT of using spin when the union uses plenty of its own. If MIT really is twisting their messaging to suggest untrue things, why doesn't the union publish annotated versions of MIT's messages, where they can mark whenever MIT says something misleading?\n\n&gt; Instead of excluding a lot of current fellows who will be RA/TAs in the future, the GSU chose to allow as many graduate students as possible to vote.\n\nWell, no, they banned anyone who is not comfortable signing a union card yet.\n\n&gt;It's actually the NLRB themselves who have set the rule that contract vote elegibility is determined by the union. There's nothing that says that it has to be the bargaining unit as defined by the NLRB\n\nVery interesting, didn't know that! I just assumed the pool of eligible voters would be identical to the bargaining unit. Any chance you could link any NLRB docs confirming this? I might have more questions about the details here (IE, could the union just make the vote open to the general Cambridge public? That would be silly, but I'm just curious what the limits would be). If you could link me some official docs saying the union can define their own voter pool, that would be great.\n\n&gt;From what I've heard, the union will be able to track who votes but not how they vote. This is the same as any government election, where you have to be registered/show your ID at the polling booth but obviously no one can know how you voted. Not really sure about transparency beyond that or what power MIT has to observe the process.\n\nSorry, I should have been clearer. Let's say the vote happens. The union is pushing VOTE NO!. Assume 10,000 people end up voting. 5500 vote NO, 4500 vote YES. The union does not like this. They decide to ignore the actual outcome of the votes, and say \"Wow! We had 9500 NO votes, and only 500 YES votes! The students totally rejected this contract heavily! Or, slightly less nefariously, imagine they never actually count the votes. Inside the ballot box is just a hidden shredder, and after the votes are done, the union says \"Oh darn, the people voted No!\". I'm not saying this union will or would do something like that, but what I am asking is what mechanisms are in place to actively prevent such a thing from happening. Again, this would be a huge conspiracy, and I'm sure someone would reveal it, but I'm just kind of taking a skeptical approach to this and wondering what is being done to ensure we can trust that the outcome is real. For the original union election the NLRB was overseeing it which set my mind at ease, but for this the union (who again, has their own desired outcome, which seems to be a conflict of interest) is running things.\n\n&gt;They've done a remarkable job of spinning a lot of these issues to make their positions seem natural and the most reasonable ones.\n\nYes, but again, so has the union. UE has 36,000 members (and that's without MIT GSU being included as of now). MIT has a total of 16,000 employees. Let's not act like the union is the underdog without any resources and that MIT is the big bad wolf. These are both very well-supported groups that are using plenty of underhanded tactics to convince people to their side.",

The point of unionization is collective bargaining, but the power of the union in negotiation is inherently tied to how large the collective is. Consider this example: if MIT attempts to negotiate for a 0% raise and the union wants to strike, your scenario leads to 7 members striking... Which is rather useless. \n\n&gt; While this is true, it's quite misleading. Imagine you were taking a class and the professor said on day one \"Here's the textbook for the class!

However, the argument for the union shop is that, inherently, you are benefiting from the collective agreement negotiated by the union. In Canada, the Supreme Court came up with the Rand formula to protect this provision. In general, collective bargaining (leads to higher average wages)[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-001-x/00902/4168247-eng.html], and by participating in the agreement created by the union, you are benefiting from the union. \n\n&gt; I am not willing to authorize them to do that when there is no contract yet. They can bargain for me once they are in power, but I'm not going to relinquish my own bargaining power prior to the union representing everyone.\n\nThe fun thing is that right now, you have no bargaining power. MIT decides what salary and benefits to pay it's graduate students, and that quantity is set by the powers that be. \n\n&gt; If MIT really is twisting their messaging to suggest untrue things, why doesn't the union publish annotated versions of MIT's messages, where they can mark whenever MIT says something misleading?\n\nThey have been doing this for the contracts and at info sessions AFAIK.\n\n&gt; For the original union election the NLRB was overseeing it which set my mind at ease, but for this the union (who again, has their own desired outcome, which seems to be a conflict of interest) is running things.\n\nYou're forgetting that MIT also has an incentive to ensure that the election is fair and the NLRB has an incentive to make sure union elections are fair. Plus, given the representation of MIT graduate students in the GSU, it would take one big leap of graft and corruption across a large body of people to mess with the vote... And for what reason? \n\n&gt; Yes, but again, so has the union. UE has 36,000 members (and that's without MIT GSU being included as of now). MIT has a total of 16,000 employees. Let's not act like the union is the underdog without any resources and that MIT is the big bad wolf. These are both very well-supported groups that are using plenty of underhanded tactics to convince people to their side.\n\nMIT has, what, a $25 billion dollar endowment and $4.3 billion in annual revenue? UE makes like $30 million in dues annually? The degree of support is pretty significantly different.",

It's really one of the only things that actually maintains the rights of the union: all the other unions at MIT have the union shop clauses, for example, and something like 95% of unions in Canada have either closed shop, union shop, or agency shop clauses (which serve similar purposes), including all TA and RA unions I'm aware of at Canadian universities. For example, UTGSU (graduate students at U of T) has the following clause: \n\n&gt;ARTICLE 7 UNION SECURITY\n\r\n&gt;7.1 The Employer agrees that all Employees, as a condition of continuing employment,\rwill become and remain members in good standing of the Union, according to the\rConstitution and By-laws of the Union, during the life of the Agreement.

It shall be the responsibility of the\rUnion to convey to new employees all information concerning the benefits of the\rUnion.\n\n&gt;7.2 The Employer will deduct from every Employee the amount authorized by the Union\ras Union dues, and assessments from the payroll during each month. Such deductions\rwill be made from the payroll at the end of each month and will be forwarded to the\rSecretary-Treasurer of the Union not later than the 15th day of the following month,\rto 25 Wood St, Unit 102B, Toronto, Ontario M4Y 2P9. Dues remittance must be\raccompanied by a list of names, contact information, and job title of all Employees\rfrom whose wages the deductions have been made. The Graduate Students' Union\rshall include the amount of Union deductions paid by each Union member on the T-4\rslip every year.\n \nIn the US, AFT/IFT Local 6300 (graduate employees at UIUC) and GSOC-UAW Local 2110 (graduate employees at NYU) have similar clauses (though often less stringent than U of T's), among other schools.",

If they're not, then you should probably vote NO anyway to get a better contract that negotiates a salary that you're happier with. \n\nLook, I'm sure you have problems with UE (I do too), but I'd rather give the union more negotiating power to get me a higher salary than just take the first thing MIT throws at me. The union's agreement affects everyone anyway, so might as well give the union more firepower to negotiate for you (and me).\n\nEdit: as long as the union's able to negotiate a raise that's more than 1.44% higher than the current offer, you're winning even if you graduate next year and use zero benefits. Remember that MIT's original offer was 4%/3.5%/3% for the next three years.",

You can also participate in clubs like the Assassins\u2019 Guild that have a huge overlap with D&amp;D interest (LARPing itself is something that hits a large fraction of one\u2019s D&amp;D craving IMO), and ask around if anyone is running campaigns.\n\nYou can also DM yourself; in my experience, the number of D&amp;D campaigns I got to play in went up dramatically once I did this, both due to converting new players and due to other DMs thinking of me as a good person to invite to your games. I\u2019m currently DMing 2 sessions per week and playing in 1.5, and both of these numbers will be increasing by 1 next month, so you can totally get your numbers up once you\u2019re more established.",

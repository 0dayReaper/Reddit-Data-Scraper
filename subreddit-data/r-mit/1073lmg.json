            "comment": "I took 14.01 and 18.02 at the same time so a bit different from your situation.\n\nPersonally I found 18.02 to be more difficult than 14.01 (I took them both in the fall as a frosh). 14.01 was very similar to AP Microeconomics but taken a step further, especially in terms of the math calculations. However, I found the theory I gained in the AP class to be very helpful to me while taking 14.01, so I was able to adapt to the difficulty of the course even though there were new concepts.\n\nI should also mention that when I was at MIT (2017-2021), the main difference between 14.01 in the fall vs spring was the final exam (not sure if that\u2019s the case still). When I took it in the fall, there was a final, but I know many people who took it in the spring to avoid it. So I\u2019m not sure what the class is like in the spring, but my experiences above are based on the fall class.\n\n18.02 was not a good time for me personally. I think a lot of it had to do with the prof I took it with. I honestly don\u2019t remember much from the class in comparison to 14.01, so I can\u2019t help much there. The only 18.02 I know that ended up being relevant to 14.01 was knowing how to do partial derivatives. Aside from that, the classes have no real impact on each other. \n\nAlso, I ended up with an A in 14.01 but a B in 18.02 so there\u2019s that. But it was also the fall, so it was actually just a P for both :)",

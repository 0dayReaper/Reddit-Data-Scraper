You just hear the train honk for a few seconds and that's about it. \n\nI'm not sure if it regularly passes by at any other time in the day.",

I even stayed there myself a couple times and I don't recall hearing anything more than what I can hear from Ashdown (this was 3 years ago though, so it's not the most up to date information and I might also be forgetting things).",

            "comment": "In order to get an EB1 you will need to demonstrate extraordinary abilities in an academic field, be an outstanding professor or a multinational manager or executive. You didn't mention if you had graduated, however if you haven't yet it's probably going to be impossible for you to apply for this visa ( unless you have Olympic medals or other very rare awards ) at the time being. If you did graduate, then only a PhD and at least 3 years of experience in academia will do. Nevertheless, if you still want to apply there are two possibilities : you can apply for yourself by filling the form I-140 or you can ask your current employer to fill it. I do not know if you have more chances by filling it yourself or not, it's up to USCIS ( only 3000 EB1 were granted in 2018 ). \n\nNow EB2, it is slightly more \"accessible\" although the number of visas granted every year is ridiculously low as well. You need to hold a bachelor's degree or higher in the field you are intending to work in, have 5 years of experience in that same field and last but not least you need a valid job offer from a US company willing to sponsor you. You will need the general permanent labor certification and you will have to fill form I-140. \n\nO1A has pretty much the same application process as EB2. You need to have a job offer from a US employer and then prove extraordinary abilities through awards or be recognized by a famous institution ( papers articles, original research etc. ). Note that if you ever had a very high salary it counts as a proof of extraordinary skills ( unless you sell oil I assume ).\n\nSo that's for the 3 visas you mentioned. I may sound pessimistic about the odds of getting these visas but they are truly hard to get. Now only those who don't buy a lottery ticket can't win am I right ?\n\nOPT is probably your best shot if you are still student at MIT or recently graduated. There are 2 types of OPT : pre OPT and OPT post completion. If you want to immigrate to the US permanently OPT post completion is what you are looking for as it allows you to work full-time. It is valid for 12 months but if you are a STEM student you can extend it for an additional 2 years ( also note that if you already did OPT for a bachelor's degree, if you are currently enrolled in a master's degree it resets and you are good to go for another 1-3 years post graduation ). You need to fill form I-765 and form I-20 ( which you probably did I am assuming ). Also you need to get in touch with your designated school official who will recommend your application. \n\nWhat I would suggest you is what many of my friends and I did :\n\n1. Marry a US citizen and become eligible for a green card ( it is sadly the easiest way ).\n2. Start with OPT ( hopefully you are a STEM major ) and every year try to apply for a H1-B visa. It is a visa that allows you to work in the US for a total period of 6 years and it gives you eligibility to seek for permanent residency. Typically 65 000 HB-1 are granted every year and 20 000 additional visas are granted to applicants who own a master's degree. Your employer needs to sponsor you and prove that a US citizen cannot accomplish the tasks that you will be doing ( for instance my mother was teacher in a French school based in Boston therefore she was eligible to apply for a H1-B visa because not a lot of US citizens are capable of teaching in French. It doesn't have to be that specific and engineers in general tend to do pretty well I reassure you ). This path is the \"easiest\" way to work in the US post graduation. In average, there are 180 000 applicants every year. Since 80 000 visas are granted every year, it gives you good chances to get it while you are doing OPT especially if you are a STEM major because you will have 3 years in a row to apply. Also make sure you will enjoy your job because you cannot work for another employer under an H1-B.\n3. You can apply for an EB-3 visa. There again, your employer must prove you and only you can do this job. To be honest though EB visas are kind of hard to get in general but EB-3 visas tend to be the most accessible ones.\n4. Win the annual green card lottery. Definitely not a reliable solution but some good friends of mine could stay post graduation thanks to it and it saved them from a lot of troubles.  \n\nI unfortunately don't have any immigration lawyers to recommend you ( the only one I knew is now retired ) but I will look nonetheless and send you a private message if I ever find someone. \n\nI hope this was helpful and informative, don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions and good luck !\n\nPS : in the title you ask for lawyers and contacts, I only shared my experience I hope my post answers your question.",

It's a straightforward process and takes about 2 years until you get green card (unless you are from China or India). From that sense, having MIT on the resume or not makes little difference.",

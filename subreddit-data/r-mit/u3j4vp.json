    "postText": "Hi! I (27M) am not an MIT student, but I currently live in the Greater Boston area, and I am interested in getting involved with the MIT Outing Club, as I heard that the club was not only open for MIT students, faculty, and staff, but also for the Greater Boston community. \n\nI've signed up for the newsletters, but it has been difficult to get in touch with an actual person (e.g. not just getting updates from the automated weekly digest) in regards to participating in MIT Outing Club events/get-togethers. The digest can be a lot to follow and I miss some of the context, as I do not currently attend the general body meetings. \n\nDoes anyone know who I can reach out to in order to find out more about the club, sign up as a member, and participate on trips? \n\nAny input regarding this would be much appreciated. Thanks!",

To join trips you have to pay a small fee to become a member (on the website) and then just sign up for trips you\u2019re interested in/qualified for on the trip signup page of the website",

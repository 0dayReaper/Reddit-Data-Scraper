And people sometimes change their majors or add a double later. i think this requirement means to get a double major approved, you have to have a 4.0 GPA currently. You can take any course you want from any major as long as you meet the prereqs, so probably if you're intending to get a double major, there are advantages to taking courses from both majors in freshman year.",

If you know you want to double major and which two you want to do it in (which most people don't) then it's more optimal to take courses beginning in freshman year for that specific goal. The double major requirements are for a specific form that you fill out whenever you want before graduating.",

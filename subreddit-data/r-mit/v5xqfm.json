    "postText": "I am a prospective student. I want to learn programming and computer science for 2 reasons. Firstly that I love it (I started learning Python in grade 11th using PY4E, but then boarding school started) and also that it will boost my application.\n\nThe point is, I can't understand if I should do the edX Harvard's CS5*0P (note the \"P\", this is not just CS50 but rather the Python part of it)* or if I should do MITx 6.00x *(which is solely about Python).* Both of these are excellent courses. I wanted to know if the MITx course would be just better because I wanna attend MIT? Though, the Harvard course seems to be more popular\ud83d\ude05.",

Aka if they have funding for a summer, they expect you to work on research that summer. If you want to explore different opportunities, I\u2019m not sure a doctorate at MIT is for you. \n\nGet in, get your degree, and get out ASAP when in grad school. Every year you delay is ~$100k in salary you choose to forgo for an \u201cexperience\u201d.\n\nTake my advice with a grain of salt though as I\u2019m a graduated, but jaded as share who finished grad school at mit recently",

On the final question, you can wager up to the total amount of money you have; if you get the question right, you get your wager added to your score; if you get the question wrong, your wager is subtracted. But she's ahead by so much that even if her opponents bet it all and answer the question right, she'll still win. So she puts the best possible answer and wagers zero dollars.\n\nAt the end, her score from a previous day is added to the current day's score (that's why it looks like she gets $ for a wrong answer) and she wins.",

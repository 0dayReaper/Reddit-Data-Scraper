    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am looking for a co-founder to join me in an exciting adventure of developing a software solution for real-time data analysis in the scientific community. Specifically, we aim to connect scientific data collection devices and software to decrease the time to data analysis in research and recommend further investigations according to the data provided by the experiment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur goal is to provide a comprehensive and seamless user experience for researchers in academia, industry, and government projects who rely on scientific devices and software to conduct their research. By integrating these tools into our solution, we believe we can greatly benefit the scientific community and advance the pace of research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are an embedded software engineer or have experience in this field and are interested in joining our mission, please reach out to me. Let's build something amazing together!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest regards",

Therefore, I'm spamming all of the top university subreddits in the hopes that someone will be dumb enough to work ~~for~~ with me.",

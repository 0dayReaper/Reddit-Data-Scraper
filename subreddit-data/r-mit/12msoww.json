    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming grad student in fall '23. \n\nsome background: I'm hoping to live in an on-campus efficiency, but if I don't get that option, I'll look for off-campus housing. I have never lived in MA before so am unfamiliar with the rental landscape. My 2-year program requires an internship that will take me out of the Boston area in summer 2024, so I would need to sublet my space for 2-3 months in the summer. \n\n**My question is: can anyone tell me how common it is to sublet off-campus housing?** Are landlords generally amenable to that? Do people do it unofficially (just pay the landlord rent and continue paying the landlord themselves? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice is appreciated, thanks! :)",

            "comment": "Definitely watch out. My current landlord's broker said subletting would be fine, but the lease I got essentially states that it would be eviction-worthy to try. Good thing I didn't need to, but always check what your lease says, it doesn't matter what anyone says verbally.  \nAlso start familiarizing yourself with the market. The general rental market here is cancerous. You're gonna pay first, security, and a brokers fee, which is usually an extra month's rent. Shit also comes and goes quickly and there are plenty of scams where people want a wire transfer very quickly and won't take a cashier's check. You'll be fine, but if you wait too long until everyone in the city is trying to find a place in August, it'll be a nightmare",

There will be a lot of people looking for summer subletters later in the game (late spring) so be sure to start looking for someone to sublet relatively early.",

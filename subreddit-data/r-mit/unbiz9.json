To improve equity of opportunity, and **to encourage gender diversity in leadership roles, the entire program is free. We do not charge any hidden fees or tuition payments from the Fellows in our programs.**\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the 200+ fellows admitted to the program, you\u2019ll be provided with world-class technical training, professional development workshops, mentorship from senior leaders, and competitive employment opportunities. **Within twelve months of graduating the program, 80% of our fellows have gained employment with a median salary of $110,000.** Current and past employer partners include Jane Street, Point72, Citadel, EY, Wal-Mart, Morgan Stanley, Accenture, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Citi, and Match Group.\n\nThe program will run from June 25th to August 7th and is open to female grad students (Masters/PhD) and working professionals. **The deadline to apply is May 31, 2022**, but we encourage students to apply as early as possible as our Admissions Committee works on a rolling basis.\n\nApply [here!](https://www.correlation-one.com/data-science-for-all-women?utm_medium=amb&amp;utm_source=amb&amp;utm_campaign=REDD)",

The campus is a living museum and I feel there are so many secret spots, art installations,  easter eggs, etc. \n\nWhat are some of your favorites? This is my last semester and I want to do a small tour :)  \n\n\nE.g. at MIT Nano, we found an AMAZING view of the Dome from the back. Very differnt vibe than from Killian.",

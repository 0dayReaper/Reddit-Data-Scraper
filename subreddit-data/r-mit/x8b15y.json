How unusual is it for people to just sleep overnight at the event? \nI was really looking forward to going but I don't have the money nor do I feel safe enough to be on a hotel alone.\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Interesting... well I was going to comment that it's incredibly common to sleep at the event, or you can sleep somewhere on campus.\n\nBut if you feel unsafe in a hotel, maybe sleeping in a random place won't be comfortable for you.\n\nAlternatively you can kill your body with 5-hour energies and coffee and not sleep that weekend, but I highly discourage that since if you are serious about HackMIT, you'll be giving presentations to companies and you don't want to be tired for that.",

There have always been events on campus where people slept overnight... but we're now in new territory. In general, the basic principles will hold true: don't attract attention, have undeniably authentic MIT connections with you in person, and don't force facilities to have to do something. Historically speaking, MIT doesn't have bored rules enforcers with nothing better to do than harass you, but at the same time it's the case that once they know you're doing something they would view as a problem, they will likely take action.",

However, I\u2019m not sure if the admin crackdown is making that harder",

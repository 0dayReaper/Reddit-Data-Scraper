    "postText": "I just got a research position offer at the broad institute as an undergrad. They want to hire me for 2 years. I\u2019m a junior undergraduate wanting to get my PhD after I graduate. Do you think this experience is worth not graduating for? Holding off at least 2 years? I go to University of Utah at the moment.",

            "comment": "I think you have a few more options:\n\n* You could take the research position, and ask to cross-enroll for your last year of undergrad at MIT. Take a couple classes a semester in addition to your research, and I'm sure you could work something out with the University of Utah to accept those credits.\n* Why not apply directly to a PhD program after the research position? Grad school applications are much more who-you-know and what-you've-done rather than test scores, grades, or even graduating college, and doing actual research is probably more meaningful than another year of college.\n\nIf both of those don't work, I can't tell you what to do. It depends on what you care about. Even if you stick with UofU you can still do research with the professors there. It would be easier, but you wouldn't challenge yourself.",

If you\u2019d have to officially \u201cdrop out,\u201d I would try to see how difficult it would be to return to Utah and work out a plan with an academic advisor or something. Would your financial aid situation be very different? Would you be able to essentially resume your original class schedule that you were thinking to do? \n\nI think it could be worth it to take the job, since you\u2019re wanting to do grad school after, but I would plan to complete with the bachelor\u2019s",

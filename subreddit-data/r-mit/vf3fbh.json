    "postText": "Hi, I need a little help. I am doing Masters in Computer Science. I am in my final year now and I have to choose an research area for my thesis. I am interested in Computer System Security. So this is what I am planning. I would learn from MIT Computer System Security 6.858 course and reading research papers reffered in the course and also some other research papers.\nWould I be able to write my thesis from this plan. I have no experience in this field. I am also doing internship so less free time. I have one year for my thesis.\nPlease need a little advice here because once I chose the research area, there is no take back.",

But I think for a master\u2019s degree and a student with great ambition (shown here!) but limited confidence (also shown here!), an advisor is especially important.  Is there someone like a Systems prof who can be your advisor for this?",

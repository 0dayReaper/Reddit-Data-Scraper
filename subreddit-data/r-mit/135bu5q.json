            "comment": "Personally I don't think this is a good way to get into a future MIT program.  \n\nDepending on your field and timing, you might want to consider completing an MITx MicroMasters instead, which are completed online:\n\n[https://micromasters.mit.edu/](https://micromasters.mit.edu/)\n\nE.g., completion of the Statistics &amp; Data Science MicroMasters gives you a pathway *to apply* to the MIT IDSS PhD -- assuming you do very well in the program and meet all other requirements for admissions. \n\nThey're a great way to participate in MIT-level graduate studies at a fraction of the cost.   Or just a way to learn + challenge yourself.\n\nNote: these courses are \"the real deal\" so expect to have to work very hard in order to get good grades in them. \n\nAnd and usual, admissions to MIT will be highly competitive even after completing a MicroMasters.  But doing well in them can help showcase your abilities to the admissions committee.",

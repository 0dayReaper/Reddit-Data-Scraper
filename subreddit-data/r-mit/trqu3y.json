It's cool, dark, and quiet 24/7, so no matter what you're sleep schedule is, you can catch good zzzz's. As far as working from home, each person is also assigned a personal room (singles -&gt; quads) that has desks, dressers, etc.,  and people tend to be pretty respectful of other people needing to be able to focus in their personal room. If you need to take a video call or something and your roommate is around, we also have a small room down in the basement that's for that exact purpose - any time you really need privacy. Hope that helps!",

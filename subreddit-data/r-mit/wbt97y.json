    "postText": "So I'm a rising junior and I sort of crammed a ton of the grad requirements the last 2 years (I'm a 6-3) and had been planning on just taking more advanced math/cs stuff. But I'm realizing now amid my boring swe internship that literally none of that will really affect my career, if I'm being super honest. Like I have enough to get more internships/a future job so I don't feel so worried about that side of life. Like, I'd like to think maybe if I find a cool enough class I might do an Meng in it just because MIT is giving a cool opportunity for working with and meeting smart people. \n\nBut at the same time, loading myself up heavily for the upcoming semesters will just give me more of the stress I've been self-imposing and I don't really think is healthy. There's this psychological fallacy that makes me suddenly think that I can handle 5 classes even though I know I'll burn out by the end inevitably, just because there's no cost to adding it to my schedule right know.\n\nAnd so I was thinking, assuming I'm gonna end up like most people at some swe job, I should start learning more about things to do outside of work. Like, I've taking some music classes that've been fun. Was thinking of maybe doing some classes like 21a.501, 21a.157 and just taking fewer classes in general to do more club stuff.\n\nShould I just make this switch and stop over-optimizing to progress my career and do more fun stuff? People always say their most memorable stuff is not the technical classes, so why should I keep doing so much of them?",

It's been awhile since I took it, but 3.094 was a really cool class. If you think you'd ever be interested in teaching, I got my teaching cert (teacher education program) and EMT cert (over IEP) while at MIT and found those really useful to have and loved those programs.",

I was able to take all four my senior year if I'm remembering correctly. It was great cause it was the same team of students for the most part throughout the whole program and we really got to know each other well. It was a pretty hands on class and we got to do student teaching in an actual classroom as well",

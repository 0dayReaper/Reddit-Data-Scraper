    "postText": "I have a Bachelor's + Master's degree and am applying for PhD programs at several universities throughout the US this year. From what I can find online, MIT only offers graduate programs that include a (sometimes informal) Master's component. \n\nGiven that I already possess a Master's degree, is there a way to skip the Master's component and avoid spending 6 years on getting a PhD?",

But that just means you wouldn\u2019t have to write a separate master\u2019s thesis; it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that courses would be waived. Some departments have all grad students take the same core courses for a common grounding in the field.",

Applicants with master\u2019s degrees from other schools can launch straight into the PhD program at MIT, provided they pass quals. Course-wise, you\u2019re allowed to cover up to 72 MIT credits with graduate classes taken outside MIT (with approval).\n\nConversely, course 20 doesn\u2019t even have an organized SM program except for MIT undergraduates, I think. I\u2019m not sure if they would accept credit for graduate classes taken outside MIT, but again I am not sure. Check your department\u2019s policy.",

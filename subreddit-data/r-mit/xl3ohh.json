The MEng program is a compressed B.S./ MEng. program which it says also clearly states online. The M.S. degree is only awarded in the PhD program after you complete your qualifications or if you're a LGO student which is a joint buisness and engineering program.",

When you fill out a grad application for the EECS department there is only the option for the joint M.S. and PhD.  Dual M.S. programs are not usually handled by EECS directly. For example the LGO program is a joint MBA/MS and you can get an EECS MS but applications are handled by Sloan. You also don't get RA research funding (usually). I also don't think the research supervisor for the M.S. even needs to be in the department...",

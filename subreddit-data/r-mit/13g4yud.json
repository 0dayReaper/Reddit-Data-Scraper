    "postText": "Hii I\u2019m an incoming frosh and I was confused about what meal plan is required for freshmen. I like cooking and I\u2019d ideally like to live in a cook for yourself dorm plus there\u2019ll probably be a lot of free food around, so I\u2019d like to minimize the number of cafeteria meals I buy. But from the MIT website, it seems like freshmen are required to take the block 225/any 21 meal plan. Is this required for everyone and is there a way to get out of it? Thanks!!",

Still there, but harder to use as a staple portion of your planning",

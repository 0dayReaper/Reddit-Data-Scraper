The traditional sentiment is that your classmates are awesome but (a) classwork can be brutally hard and (b) the administration hates you and wants to destroy the parts of student life that differentiate MIT from other schools. It\u2019s very us (undergrads) against them (work &amp; admins).\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a good social support network it\u2019s very easy to burn out. The administration is known for (at best) not proactively helping students in their struggles. And because MIT students tend to be on the awkward and somewhat asocial end of the spectrum there are a lot of people who find it an extremely alienating experience. \n\nOn the other hand there are many of people who have an excellent experience and find an incredible network of friends and colleagues. \n\nLike any college, it\u2019s mostly what you make of it. Where MIT differs most is how hands-off it is. The Institute won\u2019t *make* you leave your room and socialize, and probably won\u2019t even provide many \u201cofficial\u201d opportunities to do so. This is very different from most people\u2019s high school experience (US at least). \n\nAll that being said, MIT students are generally restless ambitious types who always want to find new challenges, so after 4 years they tend to be eager to break free and find new problems to solve.",

I live here, not where my parents live, and I have no interest in moving back in with them. I, and many other students, have moved our entire lives here. We rely on income from jobs on campus, and on support from the resources and communities around us. I won't be able to access my doctor, my psychiatrist, the off-campus activities I've already paid for, my friends, my furniture. There's no affordable housing to be found in Boston or Cambridge in a week, especially when students are cramming in midterms and psets and labs. People in my living community are scrambling to pair students with no safe homes to return to, with students with spare rooms, so that no one ends up homeless or completely isolated. There was no consideration, no consultation, everyone I know spent the entire day panicking about what little information we had. Undergrads' adult lives are not more ignorable or disposable than that of graduate students or faculty, and this decision is leaving them to crash and burn.",

If classes are online, look for housing outside of the city on commuter rail lines. A lot opens up when you do that. I\u2019ve found a place within a few days at times. My boss can\u2019t afford to even live in MA. I commute from Salem everyday. I don\u2019t know how any students afford to live in Cambridge or Boston to begin with, outside of campus housing. But definitely checkout other towns and cities that have a commuter rail stop. Especially if you will just be telecommuting, broaden your search to the North, West, and South. If this is what\u2019s happening, then the situation in the Boston area is very VERY serious, probably more than many think it is. As far as holding faculty above undergrad students, at this point, many faculty 60 and older have a good chance of dying from this virus, while healthy people in their 20s and 30s may not develop symptoms but may still carry and shed the virus. This is what is so scary about it. It\u2019s more about survival for our most at risk at this point.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add that if densely packed dorms are open for students to live there, essential employees and personnel are required to be on campus. There is a potential that at some point we will all be on lockdown (like New Rochelle) and if MIT can\u2019t provide essential personnel or services to the dorms (in the case of a lockdown), they legally cannot have students living there.",

Unless you're a shut-in, you have a network of friends, acquaintances and classmates who only require a quick briefing on your situation and that you might need help.  Reach out to them.  Odds are that someone knows someone who has a couch and a wifi password that you can borrow, even if temporarily\n3. You're an MIT student in Boston - If your campus job is on hiatus then look for other part time work.  MIT has a storied reputation around the country and the world.  Harvard might be more famous, but no one is going to wonder to themselves if you triple-legacy'ed or donated your way into a slot at MIT.  You're in your backyard and most of the townies will presume that you've got the goods to at least be competent at whatever job you apply for.

I have immunocompromised friends. If I have the ability to make their life less stressful, to avoid even accidentally doing them harm, it makes sense to do that. I probably won't mask as much as I do now, but in crowded lectures? Walking through the infinite between classes on a weekday where hundreds of undergrads breathe on each other like it's nothing? I'll probably keep it on. At this point I know contracting covid might not be dire for me personally, but that doesn't mean I'm magically okay with the idea of being the vector that infects my vulnerable friends and makes them suffer.",

I am glad you chose MIT because you seem to be a great fit to its collaborative community. \n\nI applied to the MIT transfer admission for the Fall semester of 2023, so I would be in the same year as you. Even if I have only a few days left to wait for my results, I can\u2019t stop thinking about this whole application experience.\n\nIf you have some free time, could you please take a look on my essays and provide some feedback? Even if I don\u2019t get in this time, maybe this could help in my application as a transfer for the next year.",

    "postText": "I'm an incoming grad student planning to live on campus. However, I'm a little confused how the self-selection process works for on-campus housing. In the housing portal, it seems like I need to pick a roommate before I can pick a room. At one point, it says \"**Please note roommate/suitemate matches must occur** ***prior*** **to selecting your desired housing unit.**\"\n\nIs this accurate? I don't currently have a roommate selected; does that mean I'll be unable to choose housing tomorrow?\n\nI'm planning on calling housing services tomorrow morning, just wanted to see if anyone here had any perspective on this beforehand.",

            "comment": "The process is not very intuitive. You can either find roommates and then find a suite to join with those roommates or you can just join a suite by yourself. Just proceed in the form and you will see, as long as you don\u2019t sign the rental agreement you can go back or restart the form.",

Atleast it seemed implied as so, as they had separated instructions for those who already had selected roommates (e.g. that only one person in charge will be choosing the unit).",

    "postText": "The Yale grad student Kevin Jiang was murdered at Yale by an unknown suspect. \n\n Qinxuan Pan (current MIT Grad student) was found nearby the scene late at night with a broken down car. It was later reported that the car was stolen. He was investigated by police but was let go and has been missing since. \n\nApparently he was spotted last night in Georgia. Where is he?\n\nAlso new photos were released of Pan with Kevin Jiang\u2019s fianc\u00e9 in 2020 at a social event. Maybe it was a love triangle gone wrong.\n\nCondolences to the family, fianc\u00e9 and friends of Kevin Jiang.\n\nI\u2019m curious what everyone thinks or if anyone knows Pan",

I think the most mysterious point about this case is the relation between them. If they don't have a extremely deep relationship to each other, a decent and promising man won't be triggered for murdering. According to the police Qinxuan seems to running away with plan after the shooting so it means he knew what he was doing, he planned this instead of doing this on a whim. \n\nThe relation between Qinxuan and Zion should be very obvious to the public, or at least to some close friends of either of them. If police think Qinxuan's motivation for murdering is the relationship, they must investigate with friends of both sides, and they should be able to easily tell whether there is something in their relation. But I've never heard of any statement about Qinxuan and Zion relate to each other, the police only revealed a photo showing Qinxuan and Zion are together and suspected Qinxuan murdered Zion's fiance because he has something to do with Zion. This is weird.\n\nMaybe cops, for some reason,  just want to make Qinxuan a suspect, let's think about this conspiracy.",

They were only able to arrest the guy because the murderer was bragging to his girlfriend about killing the girl, and the girlfriend was wearing a wire because she thought the wire would exonerate her boyfriend.

First, he would run out of cash and stuff that he needs to survive outdoors. Second, he doesn't know the area well enough to survive. Period. I am going to go out on a limb and say that one of his relatives is harboring him. Maybe that was the reason that the law enforcement has upgraded him to a suspect from a POI. Now his relative will be guilty of harboring a suspect on a warrant. An earlier report indicated that one of the relatives was not cooperating when questioned. I wanted to know about that but no further details have come up. This whole case has been disappointing. Pan should have been arrested by now.",

Results are then used to apply for a health QR code from the Chinese embassy in order to board a flight. Direct flights to China are difficult to find nowadays with many opting to transit in another county. However, if so they must also complete the two required tests get the results within 48 hours at that country. If Pan plotted the murder within a week and he was seen in Georgia, there's no way he could've already boarded a flight to China by now. US Marshals most likely notified TSA to be on the lookout for Pan due to the fact that they most likely checked his immigration status and found out that his is still a PRC citizen with a US green card.

Kevin was killed near her place.\\*\n\n\\- How did Pan know Kevin would be near her place at that time?\n\n\\- How did Pan know to go to New Haven on that weekend?\n\n\\- What is Zion's alibi?  It looks like she was the last person to see Kevin that evening before he was killed. \\*\n\n\\- If Kevin was shot near her place \\*, did Zion hear it?  If yes, did she call 911?  If not, then why not?\n\nFrom the timeline one can piece together from publicly available reports, it almost seems that Pan wanted to drive to New Haven, shoot Kevin, and come back to his home in MA. This because (1) it looks like he was planning to return the car at the end of the day \\*\\*, and (2) he temporarily changed the car's plate from MA to CT. \\*\\*\n\nPerhaps he thought he'd be able to \"hide\" Kevin's murder amongst the many shootings that had happened in New Haven since the beginning of the year.  Except that Zion's East Rock neighborhood is not a violent one, so it seems like a miscalculation to do it there.\n\nOf course, assuming Pan did do it -- it's looking a lot like it, given that he has yet to report to the police -- the question to me is whether Zion provided (intentionally or accidentally) any sort of information to Pan that might have enabled him to kill Kevin.\n\nI'd say instead of chasing information from dealerships, cops in charge of this case should be trying to understand the nature of the relationship Zion and Pan had -- if any -- perhaps by reaching out to friends the two have in common. \n\nNot exactly evidence, but Zion's odd reaction to Kevin's proposal, the fact that she only describes him as a friend in online social media, and the fact that they had only seen each other in person a handful of times before the engagement\\* definitely adds to the weirdness of it all. \n\n\\* [https://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/zion\\_perry\\_kevin\\_jiang\\_/](https://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/zion_perry_kevin_jiang_/)\n\n\\*\\* [https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/02/11/metro/mit-grad-student-wanted-questioning-slaying-yale-student-conn-malden-house-searched](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/02/11/metro/mit-grad-student-wanted-questioning-slaying-yale-student-conn-malden-house-searched/)",

Seemed like a really pure relationship but also only just starting. They only were living in the same place for a few months. \n\nAlso it\u2019s interesting that Malden police said they were familiar with Pan\u2019s address because of many incidences of mental illness related problems. That shows him or whoever else lived there was mentally unstable for awhile. That just points to Pan having a history of mental instability and dangerous behavior. \n\n\nRegarding Perry and her relationship to Pan, I do think investigators have interviewed her and explored her relationship with Pan. In the new conference they said they aren\u2019t releasing that info because it\u2019s an ongoing investigation. For all we know, Pan could have had an unhealthy obsession and was stalking Perry and that\u2019s how he knew her location. They might not be releasing that info to protect Perry from Pan. I\u2019m assuming if they release \u201cPerry stated that Pan was stalking her and acting innapropriately\u201d that could put Perry at extreme risk (even though that seems highly likely in my mind at this point). Authorities may fear Pan will try to take revenge on her for exposing that...\n\n\nIt\u2019s really tragic and yes I wonder about their relationship but right now it\u2019s all speculation. Hopefully with time we can understand better what Pan\u2019s involvement was and motive but right now it\u2019s hard to say. I\u2019m just waiting until they catch him and release more info. I want more people talking about finding Pan and the news to get out. He needs to be detained because he might be armed and dangerous. I don\u2019t want anyone else to get hurt. I\u2019m not sure if the Atlanta news stations are really broadcasting finding him and I\u2019m worried he\u2019s left the state or even country at this point....",

That shows him or whoever else lived there was mentally unstable for awhile. That just points to Pan having a history of mental instability and dangerous behavior. \"\n\nHere's another thing that doesn't make sense according to this article, people that want to get a firearms license in Massachusetts need to go through a series of steps including meeting with a police officer in your local PD. There are also a series of background of checks statewide and nationwide including with the state's department of mental health. It has been reported that police have responded to Pan's residence in Malden several times for mental illness issues. Why would they issue a firearms license to someone in a residence that police have been called several times before. Therefore, he must've obtained the gun he used to kill Kevin illegally but the question is HOW?\n\n[https://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/20200321/massachusetts-sees-more-than-700000-gun-license-applications-in-decade](https://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/20200321/massachusetts-sees-more-than-700000-gun-license-applications-in-decade)",

I have no idea how he would have obtained a gun but also I\u2019m not exactly sure how they run the background check and check mental health for gun purchase. Maybe the incidences that happened didnt matter for gun purchase or flew under the radar. It would be interesting to look into the gun purchase qualifications in more depth. Also it\u2019s not clear if the mental health health related incidences were related to Pan (although it\u2019s likely him). It could have been parents or other family in the residence. Also we don\u2019t know how long he owned the gun. He could have obtained it prior to the incidences, or he could have obtained it illegally. \n\nAlso we still don\u2019t know if he was the gunman so there\u2019s that too. The gun related to Jiang\u2019s death from what I know hasn\u2019t been recovered either. It\u2019s all speculation &amp; I have a lot of questions.",

Yet I am not totally sure if Pan knew Kevin's whereabouts that Saturday when he was planning his murder. As Boston Globe writes, Pan tried laying down in the back of the SUV which he later stole. It suggests that Pan was considering hiding Kevin's body rather than leaving Kevin to die at the curb. I really hope he will be eventually caught. It is scary that people like Pan are living among us.",

For all we know, that smile in the Swing picture could be the only signal of approval she gave him. He took that, ran with it, stalked her for months and couldn\u2019t stand the idea that another Asian man could marry her. \n\nYes, another Asian man. This phenomenon is exceedingly common, across all races. Many men rationalize rejection by saying, \u201cwell, it\u2019s not me. She just doesn\u2019t like (fill in the blank with any ethnicity) guys.\u201d So, once she ends up going with a guy of THAT race, it crushes the man because he discovers that, \u201cshe didn\u2019t turn me down because of my race (something external, out of one\u2019s control and revealing of shallowness in HER) she turned me down because of ME!? (Something internal, potentially within one\u2019s control and revealing of something repulsive within HIM.)\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s obvious this man committed this crime and his behavior is all the proof we need. I live several blocks from the crime scene and I can say with certainty that no spurious murders occur around here. This had to be a personally driven assassination, not a random act of gang violence or homeless burglars. \n\nThe only other theory that holds some weight (and this one is quite nuts) is that this was planned by the fianc\u00e9 as well as Pan. Here me out. She felt bad turning the guy (Jiang) down for the marriage, but wanted to get rid of him so manipulated Pan into doing the deed. I have a feeling she\u2019s not stupid enough to go through with something like that though.",

(Something internal, potentially within one\u2019s control and revealing of something repulsive within HIM.)\u201d  There is obviously some significant differences between the two men. Remember these two weren't the same. Kevin is your typical ABC (American Born Chinese) but he's served in the army and he's a devout Christian. The guy Qinxuan Pan is your typical FOBBY NERD even though he's been here half his life. People who grew up in that system in China are taught to hate people like Kevin. I think the fact that Kevin served in the military and was a Christian made the FOB resent him even more and the fact that someone he deemed a Chinese traitor is now with the girl he was longing over. She chose someone who has more in common with her given that he was born and raised in America and worships Jesus the way she does .",

Whereas Pan is the stereotypical Chinese FOB who exceled in math but sucks at being a well round individuals.  There are other examples of these types of sociopaths: a graduate Chinese male student who beheaded his girlfriend at Va Tech dining hall when she told him she wanted to break up with him, the Michigan Chinese Ph.D. student who took a shogun and killed some of his Ph.d. thesis panelist who got in way.  All these example have one commonality: nerdy socially ill adjusted male Chinese student from China.  An ABC who grew up in the US, participate in sports, and overall well adjusted will never do what Pan did.",

I had a friend who did swing and majority of the swing members were elderly, so I think it\u2019s normal to see older folks dancing. I didn\u2019t see anything too weird about the dance after watching the video. It\u2019s probably a good way and more natural way for singles to meet too. Pan was pretty energetic dancing. In my opinion, the dance looked pretty fun but also kind of awkward haha.",

I think Zion is dancing with a girl\nfrom Pan's program.\nDidn't they film this in a hall at the university?\nAlso there's no old ladies dancing only old white guys in their sixties. That's why I figured they were probably professors as to janitors or rando elderly people. I saw the girls brushing off invites from said old guys to dance with each other. Pan comes over when Zion is dancing with a younger dude.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm applying to an MA program at Harvard next year and likely a PhD program at MIT the year after. I've done some research, and it looks like I could at least in theory be an MIT GRA at at a FSILG from the start: https://studentlife.mit.edu/beagra/gra-candidates/faqs-eligibility. Has anyone had a non-MIT GRA or been/seen one? How hard would it be to become one?",

There is an application form where you have to answer questions about what you are like, how you would handle certain tough situations, and what kind of events you would throw. I cannot stress how important these essays are! It is the only information the students will get about you, and there are a lot of applicants for very few positions so you need to make yourself stand out. After you apply the students in the living group will pick candidates to interview and ultimately hire. We had two rounds of interviews, one with students and one was a mixer with all of the final candidates, students, and heads of house.",

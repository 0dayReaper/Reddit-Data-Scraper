    "postText": "As an incoming PhD student, I have been talking to a professor who would like me to work in their lab and I said I would like to but I would like to wait until the open house to make that decision firm,( basically was trying to insinuate that I want to look at other options and make sure I am making a well informed decision).\n\nI just want to make sure, there is nothing wrong with reaching out to other profs in the same department as them to ask what they are working on and the opportunity to work with them so I can know my options well right?\n\nI just want to make sure I do not offend the first professor.\n\nThank you in advance!",

            "comment": "This probably varies by discipline. For some, you apply to the PhD program knowing exactly who you want to work with and are assigned them as your advisor straightaway. Sounds like that\u2019s not the case in your situation though. It\u2019s definitely not a problem to talk with other faculty in the department, but you should also already have a sense of what they\u2019re working on based on their websites. Just be kind to the prof who is interested in you and see things from their POV too. If there are other incoming students, then they may be looking at other options too ;)  P.S. def talk to other PhD students and post docs working with the person you are planning to work with too. It\u2019s really important to pick someone who has a compatible supervision style for what you need (i.e., letting you be more independent versus managed). Good luck!",

            "comment": "At least in my field (ecology/marine science/etc.) this is often encouraged, particularly if you are not fully decided/convinced about an advisor yet. The advisor-advisee relationship is one of the most imp aspects of your phd career (again, at least in my field)   My field of research is narrow and most people know each other even at different universities. I talked to multiple professors at various universities and within same departments and never had a problem. I would say it is a red flag if a professor questions your intent of finding the best match for you or gets bitter bc of your decision. It is important that you maintain open communication and let give them updates about your decision- as soon as you know let them know, they will appreciate this (again, if they are a good human being)",

I talked to every professor in my subdivision before committing to one\u2026 of course I just said I\u2019m interested in getting to know a bit more about their work and didn\u2019t say anything about committing to the group beforehand. I think it\u2019s also pretty normal for people to do a trial project with one prof and decide whether to switch group or not after that.",

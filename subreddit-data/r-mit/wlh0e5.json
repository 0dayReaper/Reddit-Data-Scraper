I really liked the campus and all that but I\u2019m really worried I won\u2019t be able to adapt to that kind of environment\u2026\n\noh and I\u2019m thinking of majoring in architecture if that helps",

            "comment": "GIRs are not only science classes, HASS classes are also GIRs. But I would be surprised if you wouldn't need any math/physics knowledge in architecture major. That being said, people are not the greatest fans of GIRs but I found them fun to take even without prior knowledge in the subject. It helps you to experience something different and learn something that you know won't be useful but still is required.\n\nAll this being said, note that MIT is very STEM-heavy place. Most other people you know will talk about coding, math, physics, chem etc. So make sure you know you would be comfortable with that. I am not knowledgeable about architecture, but I would bet some of MIT's course 4 classes would also be STEM-oriented.",

(18.01 will be just over twice as fast as AP Calculus BC.)\n\nPutting on my interviewer hat,\n\nSTEM is very much part of MIT's culture (and your peers will largely be coming from a STEM perspective). There's still a strong engineering ethos that permeates MIT's culture.\n\nIf you don't LOVE STEM, including approaching architecture from a STEM perspective, then I'd rethink applying.",

In fact I know someone like OP at MIT\u2014intended architecture major who didn\u2019t take that many advanced science classes in high school. That being said, you do have to be very competent in STEM to succeed here, regardless of whether you like it, but if you do end up getting in, it means the admissions officers agree that you will succeed.\n\nMIT wasn\u2019t the best fit for me in retrospect, but I still think it was a good idea to apply; the faculty in non-STEM departments are still world-class, there is so much cool stuff going on, and MIT is in a great location imo.",

You have several options for Chemistry (3.091, 5.111, 5.112).\n\n8.01 is like AP Physics C Mechanics, and trying to get a 5, but over twice as fast. (I managed to self-study for that, but I love STEM, plus I thought Physics/Math were my best subjects in high school.)\n\n8.02 is about as hard, a little more than 8.01 (Calculus-based Electricity and Magnetism, getting into Maxwell's Equations in integral form, really needs to go with 18.02.)\n\n18.01 (Single-variable Calculus/AP Calculus BC) isn't terribly difficult if you like math but again, is more than twice as fast as AP Calculus BC.\n\n18.02 (Multivariable Calculus) is a bit faster than 18.01.\n\nBiology also has some options and isn't a cakewalk.",

(Or if you plan to do RA instead of EA, you have until \\~Christmas.)\n\nIf you're crushing both and both leave you unsatisfied and you want more, much faster (18.01 = over 4x AP Calc AB speed), more in depth, harder grading, etc. then by all means, apply.\n\nIf you're really disliking the materials or it's too hard or whatever, there are plenty of great architecture schools and programs. (A high school friend went to RISD, which I know is unranked, but she had a good time in her program and she's an architect now. Plus I believe junior year she spent in Italy around Pisa/Florence.)",

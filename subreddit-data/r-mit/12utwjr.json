I am extremely excited that I got into both of these programs, but I am a little bit confused as to which would be better to attend? I\u2019m looking to see which experience would benefit me the most for the time I put in (MITES is around 6 months while CMU Summer Session is around 6 weeks), and which would help me out when applying to colleges the most? Thanks In advance for any help!",

            "comment": "As someone who did MITES Semester and CMU SAMS, probably MITES (I knew people that did Summer Session while I was there). They found out I was doing both at the same time so they forced me to choose one, and I chose SAMS, which I sort of find myself regretting now that college apps are over for me. You get to meet lifelong friends at both programs, but MITES does provide a lot more college app support and for a longer period of time. Almost everyone (or at least it seemed from the Discord server haha) ended up going to a T20 too (for SAMS it\u2019s the same but I can\u2019t say for Summer Session). I really regret not being able to finish out MITES Sem because I really would\u2019ve liked getting to finish the classes I was taking. One of my instructors even complimented the code I submitted for the first lab we did and showed it to the class\ud83d\ude22 \n\nTo compare both: MITES has a one week in-person component which will get you acclimated to life on a college campus (and it\u2019s MIT!) and rest of it is virtual. They didn\u2019t do the in-person week for my year though. Summer session is in-person the whole time, and CMU\u2019s facilities and residence halls are really nice. If you really really want college credit, do Summer Session, but otherwise MITES offers really cool classes too. If you\u2019re looking specifically for college app support, definitely go with MITES since that\u2019s a huge part of the program. I don\u2019t remember Summer session offering that, although SAMS definitely does. You have to pay for Summer session, while MITES is completely free. (SAMS is completely free too, for better context of my decision). Thinking long-term, MITES is better because those extra college credits from the classes you take may or may not be helpful anyway (like intro to python might be something that you can APCSA credit out of anyway), and MITES looks good on college apps, although that may be due to correlation and not causation: MITES Semester people are already the best of the best in terms of academic achievement and motivation. Everyone there is super supportive too, even though it\u2019s virtual.",

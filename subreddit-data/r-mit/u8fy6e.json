Another factor is customer service. Big banks tend to bundle things up and try to upsell you all sorts of things. MITFCU did not. \n\nSo, there is a lot to like and we are very happy we went with them.",

In the past, they were originated by Member's Mortgage.\n\nThat said, we got a mortgage through MITFCU in Nov. of 2020 and were mostly happy. Our loan officer gave me a few panic attacks by going unresponsive leading up to a few big deadlines, but ultimately everything ended up fine.",

It was a pretty smooth process, though as another person notes, they've just switched to handling all mortgages in-house, so I can't vouch for how easy the process is now.\n\nOne nice thing about MITFCU is that they won't sell your mortgage to some random company you've never heard of; you'll deal with them through the life of the mortgage unless you choose to refi elsewhere.",

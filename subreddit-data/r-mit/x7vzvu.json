    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am cross-registering MIT courses, and there is a course I really would like to take but has a time conflict with one major-required Harvard course. I wonder if there is any way I can audit the MIT course and have access to Canvas and course material so that I can learn by watching recordings and solving homework etc.\n\nThanks!!",

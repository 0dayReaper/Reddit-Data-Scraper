    "postText": "Hi all. This is sort of just me venting into the void so please delete it if it's not appropriate for this reddit. \n\nToday I saw in my email that there was a survey for the mit student experience and I decided to do it cuz why not. One of the questions was like \"I have friends at MIT\" and I knew the answer to that was \"strongly disagree\" which made me start laughing and then I broke down into crying on my bed for some time.\n\nI literally have zero friends at this school and I'm a sophomore already. I don't really know what went wrong with me. During high school I was a quiet kid but I was kinda \"adopted\" into my friend group by a \"popular\" kid who is still by best friend to this date. I started coming out of my shell a bit more and eventually felt socially comfortable at my high school. I still miss those days alot, my previous friends have now gone to other colleges. \n\nWhen I got into mit, of course I was surprised and happy and all that. But a tiny part inside me was dreading the fact that I would have to go to a new city all alone. That tiny part knew that I would probably retreat back into my shell in such an unfamiliar place. But then COVID happened, and it was announced that us 2024s would not be coming to campus for our first year. I don't really remember how I felt about that, maybe part relief of getting to stay with the people I know for a bit longer, part dread of knowing eventually I would have to go. \n\nSo first year fall semester was fully remote, that went okay for me. I didn't make any friends then but I just told myself it's because everythings remote, I'll have plenty of chances when we get back to campus. Then comes spring semester and 2024s get the option to come to campus or stay remote. It was during this time that something personal and bad happened, so ultimately I couldn't go to campus for spring. I did my classes and everything and told myself I would make friends when my sophomore year started \n\nSophomore fall semester starts and I find myself struggling a little to get used to student life on campus. Managing walk time between classes, figuring out food, all that logistical stuff. Classes were rough and my grades weren't as high as last year. My mental health has never been so great, but it was this semester where I started spiraling. I used s3 where I could and have a therapist but that tiny feeling of dread that I had a year ago had grown into a vortex of negative emotions. Still no friends. Clubs and activities exist to join, but I already felt overwhelmed by course work, not to mention anxiety of just being with people I don't know. It's here where I start to feel like I'll never make any friends here.\n\nIt just sucks. I don't know how college social life is supposed to work. Everybody is in a rush to their classes and is busy with parts and I'm the same, so I don't feel like I have opportunities to like socialize at lectures or recitations. I live in a dorm and my neighbors are polite but we never talk to each other or hang out. Above all, I feel like the 2024s who did choose to go on campus first year spring have already formed their friend groups with the help of the pods system. It just feels impossible for me to get to know anyone outside of saying \"hi\" or \"ooh yeah that was a hard pset\". I'm not a very outgoing person and I feel trapped by it. It feels like everybody else has it figured out, everyone else has friends, can better manage class/clubs and have good grades at the same time.\n\nIt's spring semester of sophomore year now and nothing has changed. And I think I believe nothing ever will. I know that I can't just sit around and expect friends to line up for me, but I'm too tired or unmotivated or anxious to do much else. I know I don't have anyone else to blame except myself and I just feel powerless because of that. \n\nThis is such a great school and what really burns is the feeling of all the opportunities and experiences I'll never have. Like staying after lecture and getting to know a professor and maybe eventually uroping with them, or going to parties with friends, or something just as simple as seeing someone you know walking down the infinity and saying hi.\n\nI don't know where I'm going with all this, both I'm the context of this post and my life at mit as a whole. It's just kinda funny how I remember writing about all the cool opportunities at mit for my application essays and now, halfway through my undergrad I haven't done a single one. Or how my family always asks if I'm doing ok and if I have friends and if my classes are alright and all I can do is lie to their face and say \"yea I'm fine\" because I don't want them to worry. I'm just tired of everything and it feels like nothing can change.\n\nI never imagined I would make it here but I also never imagined that it would hurt this much to be here. So yeah that's it vent end. This will probably get deleted idk lol but I felt like typing this out might help more than swimming in my thoughts and staring at the ceiling for another hour. Thanks for reading sorry for bad formatting, on my phone",

Please get help. You probably have a better idea than I do what mental health services are available these days. There is no shame in using them - just like you\u2019d go to the doctor regularly if you were struggling with managing diabetes or something. \n\nAlso, if it helps \u2014 everyone at MIT is a shy nerd. Most of us were socially awkward outcasts in high school. What really helped me break out of my shell there was the realization that no one else had any idea what they were doing socially, either. \nBest of luck and Internet hugs.

            "comment": "I'm a freshman and I definitely can relate to some of the things you've mentioned. Even though it was our first time on campus, during the fall it felt like most other first-years already knew people and already had friend groups. I guess part of that is because I didn't do a good job of meeting people and making friends during orientation, which is when a lot of others did. Another factor was that many people had reached out to other incoming freshmen over the summer via social media, which is something I've never really been good at.\n\nThat being said, things did get better; I've found that there's a really great snowball effect to meeting people -- one you become close with one person, you'll meet some of their friends, and then some of those people's friends, and so on. And, I think you can meet people in unexpected ways -- one of the first close friends I made on campus was because I connected with them on LinkedIn (of all places), and I sent them a message saying hi and asking about what classes they were taking, which led to a longer conversation and eventually to us meeting up IRL. This person is now one of my closest friends and I hang out with them almost every day.\n\nIn terms of balancing time, I've found that meals (dinner especially) are a great time to hang out and catch up with people since you're (usually) not working while eating. I usually enjoy working in the same room (lounge or larger dorm room) as friends as well, even if we're working on different things since we can often feed off of each other's productivity with the occasional joke or discussion here and there. Also, going to floor study breaks is a good way to take a few minutes off and meet some people who live near you.\n\nFinally, as I said I'm a current student, so please feel free to dm me if you want someone to talk to, or to grab dinner with. I think others have given some great advice on this thread so far, and I sincerely hope you're able to find some of it helpful.",

I didn\u2019t make any friends in my major because I fell behind (and to be honest they weren\u2019t the most welcoming bunch either). I did make friends in my living group but I fell out with just about all of them before my super senior year. So I had no friends by the end. I have no advice for you, I\u2019m sorry :( just know you\u2019re not weird for going through this and feeling this way. Best of luck",

Being social, especially as a person who tends towards introversion, feels like work and practicing a difficult skill. \nIt can feel disheartening to see a lack of people reaching out or realizing there is no consistency in interactions day to day, but in an environment where so many people are hosed and moving about I think it is common to find oneself struggling with loneliness.\n\nI was the 'adopted' friend in HS too and something that I am grateful about after being removed from that dynamic is that I had to learn how to develop my own \"social life\" and find people I chose to continue to build connections with, despite the difficulty. My life is not like a sitcom of consistent friend groups, but I get to hang out with cool people once in a blue moon when our schedules line up and I cherish those moments.",

            "comment": "I'm sorry that you are struggling so much with loneliness at MIT. I can definitely remember times when I was pretty damn miserable and lonely there myself. It's not uncommon to feel exactly how you are feeling. \n\nThat being said MIT is really cool because in a lot of ways you get back what you put into it. Think about the stuff you find interesting/fun/exciting and see if there are groups that engage in your interests. I did that once upon a time and while I was never the most social of butterflies I did find people who became lifelong friends. You don't need to dramatically force yourself out of your comfort zone (reddit is also a good option if you want to connect with folks more anonymously or less in person) but you may need to put yourself out there a little more to give people a chance to meet you socially. Look into social groups at MIT and in Boston. See what's out there and challenge yourself to go meetings and see who's there. Maybe you don't end up wanting to socialize that way but along the way you can meet one or two or more interesting folks to get to know and who can help alleviate some of the loneliness. \n\nWhat you're feeling is 100% normal, but don't let it scare you away from getting out and meeting people (especially the ones who like what you like). You will almost certainly be surprised at how cool some of the folks you meet are and how much you will have in common with some of them. Just remember that if it feels like people are in too much of a rush under normal circumstances then meeting them in social situations (i.e. social group meetings) is a good way/time to catch them when they aren't rushing around dealing with all the craziness that is MIT.",

But sometimes, things like joining extracurricular or social groups is just too big a jump from the normal routine. there's too much friction involved. Considering the workload, rushed schedules, and a more introverted personality, I  don't want to be worrying about the dynamics in a real-life chat. it makes me anxious.\n\nidk if this helps but my friends are building an option which reduces a lot of friction. a social-audio app that brings college students in Boston together to share interesting stories, talk 1-1 through audio. The goal is to remove loneliness and build a community where every student can feel heard. Sort of like you post a specific thought and someone who's keen to talk about it will call you and chat 1-1, skipping the small talk. or you can browse and call others.\n\nThey use me as one of their case studies. they r prolly launching before summer.\n\nI told them I want on-demand convos even when I'm in the dorm. That way as compared to joining social clubs irl, i can save time and don't have to be that awkward, after all, it's voice.\n\nWith that said, voice calls can never replace irl interactions, Im fully cognizant of that. but i guess with this option, it reduces a lot of friction: time, awkwardness, effort. and if we manage to hit it off, it's not too late to meet up and have dinner, it catalyzes more interactions by improving students accessibility. it will still require effort on your part to call, but it's a lot lesser than physically going to places and chatting with other students irl, which is what I've been looking for.\n\nIm not sure will this increase your hope that the future will be better bcos of more options. if not, just know that we're in this shit tgt and we're tryna solve this too.\n\nGrads seem to sing the same song: in the working society, your grades mean nothing, who you know and how you interact with others mean the world. make the best out of college.\n\nAnd i've been trying to expand my social circle sincerely but i've been running into the same problems as you. sigh... im willing to put in effort but not too drastic change in routine.\n\ncollege will be a lot more fun when we get on-demand convos without harassers or trollers, but just people who's looking to truly chat, exchange stories and best case scenario, make new friends. i believe in a better future in college and i hope you can hold onto that hope too. \n\n.",

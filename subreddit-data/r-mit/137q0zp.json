    "postText": " Hello! I'm part of a lab ( the [Fluid Interfaces Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/fluid-interfaces/overview/)  )  who are testing a new app to improve sleep quality by using  pulses of   white noise to increase delta waves in the brain.  We\u2019ve  developed a   mobile website and are conducting an experiment to see if  this can   improve how people rate their sleep and also increase focus  and mood   during the day. We're particularly interested in whether this  might help people with sleep disorders like insomnia.\n\n**If you\u2019d like to try it out, you can** [**sign up here!**](https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_86Qmrrgfbu2U79c?source=r2) I\u2019ll also be on here to answer questions.\n\n**How does this work?**  \nWe know from studies in sleep labs that playing soft pulses of white noise can [improve memory](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40675-021-00207-0) and [enhance the restorative functions of sleep](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29215045/) . This is thought to occur because the pulses of white noise increase delta waves in the brain, which are responsible for many of the   benefits  of sleep.\n\nHowever,  previous  studies have examined only small groups of people over a   single night,  and have not examined how the pink noise affects things   like daytime  sleepiness and sleep quality. The goal of this experiment   is to test  whether this kind of stimulation can produce overall   improvements in  sleep and cognition. To do this, we use the motion   sensors in mobile  phones to detect when you are in deep sleep and then   play soft pulses of  white noise. The motion data is also used to   control the volume of the  sound so your sleep is not disturbed. In the   morning and evening, the  app will ask you some questions about your   sleep and day and have you  complete a brief cognitive test.\n\n**Can I use it if someone else sleeps in my bed?**  \nYes! We have tested it in this case, and it is designed to activate when *both* people are in deep sleep.\n\nAgain, if you have any questions about the experiment, feel free to ask them here!",

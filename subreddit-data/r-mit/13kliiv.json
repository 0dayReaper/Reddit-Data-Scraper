            "comment": "Definitely not qualified to make this decision but was an GRT for 3 years and saw a lot of student issues...\n\n1) MIT is a small campus and something like 80% of the undergrads live in the dorms. It's pretty tough to disconnect from school because of that and it contributes to a lot of stress. What's more is that there isn't really much space at all. It's difficult to even study without someone within a few feet from you. Yale is definitely different here. More space per student and a lot of opportunities to disconnect from the engineering rigor since it's a liberal arts school and New Haven around the main campus is a bit less crowded as well.\n\n2) Problems don't usually solve themselves after arrival for most people, especially thingsike family issues and family related stress.\n\n3) S3 and student help services here are really good, but they don't solve systematic and longer term issues.\n\nMany people often forget that any education at a recognizable school is going to be really good and any difference if any is marginal. Yale might even be better over MIT on teaching quality which might be better for you. There's a huge number of people in CS here and I know previous students have had trouble getting help from profs when needed.",

            "comment": "MIT will not be like those rigorous math camps all the time! Every student here has a mixture of good, relaxing semesters and terrible, down-in-the-dump semesters. The bad semesters do take a toll on your mental health, but they are survivable if you are able to build a good support system and ask for help early. Look to clubs and living groups, find yourself a home of close friends away from home. (Many students call MIT their first or second home because student life is so vibrant here.) Go to office hours often, ask for a tutor if you need it, visit the student support offices when things are going downhill. Really take time and recover over IAP and vacations. Balancing and doing all this independently as a young adult is part of any college experience, it's just that MIT might dial up the academic expectations.\n\nBut it sounds like a big component of your decision is wanting to stay close to your family and your dog, and that's important too. I felt *extremely* ready to leave home and transplant myself into a college bubble when I was graduating high school and moving to MIT. If homesickness has been a challenge in the past, it will likely be a challenge again. Depends on how ready you feel to take that on as another part of the balancing act.",

My friends told me it was imposter syndrome, and I think part of it is that, but still\u2014at those camps, I was constantly falling behind. I'd take the longest to solve the psets, I'd solve the least number of problems, I'd always be getting ideas from my friends, and my exam scores were quite literally the lowest out of everyone there (though I know people at those camps are crazy smart anyway). By the end of both programs, I was quite honestly sick of math, and all I wanted to do was go home.\"\n\nthis is scary. mit is like this lol....\n\nyou're probably pretty smart and can be good at CS if you stay confident. you're going to need confidence to keep working hard and learning. if you start to lose confidence its gonna suck. mit might give u imposter syndrome given your past experience",

The difference in results from one over the other have the potential to be drastically different long term, but neither are going to set you up for the future any less than the other. Both schools will produce amazing results for you in the long term, so don't stress about which one will better set you up for the future. Attempt to abandon your fears around both programs and listen to your gut/heart. Hope this helps",

Many wear it as a badge of honor, but you don\u2019t have to, it\u2019s weird. I know plenty of people who did the average workload and mostly just chilled without a deluge of extracurriculars. I was fairly involved (Fraternity leadership, student club, and research) and I can count on one hand the number of times I had to pull all-nighters over all 4 years.

It's normal for everyone to have 1 or 2 semesters that get really rough with courses, but the only people I ever witnessed being that overwhelmed *every* semester were those who were overextending themselves and unwilling to drop their commitments to multiple time-consuming extra-curriculars &amp; intense UROPs, and/or those who took extra classes they didn't need to, optional minors, second majors, etc. \n\nI did one major, no minors, only 1 extracurricular, &amp; only UROPed during the summer and I pulled zero all-nighters during undergrad. If you can get past the mindset that you need to be doing the most at all times, MIT can be very manageable.",

            "comment": "to add to what everyone else has said, here\u2019s a few things:\n\nthere\u2019s definitely more support here than at a rigorous math camp. things like tsr^2, for example, are really helpful to make sure you aren\u2019t lost and hopelessly confused slaving away on psets alone, and office hours are always great. the feelings of imposter syndrome probably won\u2019t go away, though. that\u2019s something we learn to accept.\n\nif you go through the process (which i\u2019m admittedly not familiar with myself), you can get your dog registered as an emotional support animal. the restrictions for having a dog in a dorm are pretty strict on paper, but cat halls tend to be more lax with emotional support animals (even if they aren\u2019t cats), since there\u2019s already free-roaming pets on the hall. unfortunately, since east campus is getting renovated, random hall is the only dorm that currently has cat halls.\n\nfor the issues of stress: the hardest part is learning not to pset alone and learning to take advantage of all the resources offered here. classes are hard, but it\u2019s so much worse to try to do everything alone. if you have friends to work with, things become infinitely more manageable, especially when you also go to office hours and take advantage of resources like s^3 when you need to.\n\nrealistically, you probably won\u2019t miss out on much if you go to yale instead of mit. the biggest difference is probably urops (urop stands for undergraduate research opportunities program, a program which makes it significantly easier to do research as an undergrad and get paid to do it, something which is extremely difficult for undergrads at most colleges), everything else is culture-specific (like which specific student groups exists and which classes there are and stuff). there\u2019s also mit\u2019s dorm culture, which is pretty different from most colleges (each dorm is very different and has a different history and culture, in ways that go beyond just groups of friends who live in the same place. especially the east side dorms (east campus and random hall) and, to a lesser extent, burton connor, as well as the cultural houses in new house. i personally value it a lot.\n\nthis is a really big decision to make, regardless of which college you choose. remember, there\u2019s no right answer. like petey said, no matter what you do, [you\u2019ll become yourself](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/choosing-to-become-yourself/).",

I\u2019ve also started calling my mom or my brother everyday, even scheduling daily online chess sessions or playing some other game with my brother.

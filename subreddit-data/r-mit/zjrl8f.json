    "postText": "So over the last year or so, I\u2019ve been visiting my local bookstore to read MIT Tech Review when it comes out. I really like the articles, hearing about new technologies being developed etc. Plus i think it\u2019s better than other technology magazines like wired imo. However, my local bookstore and several magazine stores (like shoppers drug mart, I\u2019m from canada) have stopped putting issues out. So i checked my local library and they don\u2019t have the magazine anywhere (online or physical) and my last resort was getting the subscription. Unfortunately, i would have to pay $200 CAD upfront, and truthfully that\u2019s a lot for me as a student. I know that mit students/alumni get the subscription for free, and i don\u2019t know anyone who goes there. I understand this is a crazy huge ask coming from a stranger, to ask someone for their subscription, so i completely understand if no one responds or if i get backlash. \nIf anyone has any alternative options i\u2019d be glad to hear them. I\u2019ve also tried looking for ways to buy the issues separately online but i\u2019ve had no luck. \nThank you!",

Navigate to the setting for\u00a0subscriptions\u00a0and make your selections.\n\nTo receive the print magazine, you must have provided an up-to-date postal address to the MIT Alumni Association. You can easily make updates to your\u00a0address online.\n\nTo go paperless, simply change your alumni subscription to digital-only by visiting the MIT\u00a0Alumni Association website.\"",

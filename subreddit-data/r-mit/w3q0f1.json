I'm taking the new course ***6.3950 AI, Decision Making, and Society (6.404)*** next semester and am super pumped since it's covering exactly what I'm interested in (ethics of AI and the diversity of its impacts on society) and would love a friend or two:)",

I feel like 6-3 and 6-2 have stood the test of time in terms of being rigorous majors that teach students how to solve hard problems. Personally, I feel like someone with a major in AI and decision-making might have people doubt in their skills in other areas of CS, but the converse might not be true.\n\nEither way, I\u2019m following, I love AI and had a fun time studying it and doing projects related to it.",

I'm certainly not choosing this major because I think it will provide me with as strong of a CS/technical background as 6-3 or 6-2(rip). So if anyone doubted my skill in other areas of CS they'd be completely right to do so (6.046 isn't even a requirement!).  \nBut I'm less interested in learning all the ins and outs of the computer and the most complex techniques and more interested in the societal effects of our most widespread algorithms as well as the potential effects of those that are emerging. 6-4 gives me the chance to really explore that.\n\nSo while I agree it's a far less technical degree than 6-3 or 6-2, I think it's a bit of a mischaracterization to call it a fad major. It is a great and important choice for those less interested in the computer and more interested in how the computer interacts with its user and, just as importantly, the world around it.\n\nTo be fair, it is brand new and untested and could let me down in that respect. But from everything I've read (which is most of what has been released about it) that's the hole it seems to be designed to fill.",

Do you think it can still provide the same amount of CS background as 6-4 if you take the right classes? And is it generally designed to be a more society, ethics, and philosophy based major, or does it go into more of the technical aspects, such as coding AI? Also, do you now know any other people who are going into 6-4 and also provide insight into what it may be like or how it is? I'm not sure if the MIT semester term has started yet, but if it has, I'd also like to know how your classes are like so far. Thank you for your time!",

                                    "comment": "Hi! No worries! One piece of advice I'd give preliminarily is that these nuances really don't matter right now (or even until around someone's sophomore year at MIT). When looking at colleges I cannot emphasize enough how much more important the environment and culture are than the specifics of any major.\n\nThat being said: 6-4 is still a very technical and CS-oriented major. 6-3 requires at least intro classes to a lot of specialized fields you might enter as a programmer and 6-4 does not, but both will give a student a very strong set of programming skills. Both majors, for example, will teach you how to make AI/ML systems. 6-4 has some requirements that are more social based than technical (such as AI, Data-Driven Decision Making, and Society) and has slightly more of an emphasis on ethics and society, but is absolutely not based on those tenents--I personally think MIT as a whole does not provide students with enough skills to consider how their technical skills and their applications might affect society. I'm really liking 6-4 so far and am excited for the new courses available to me! Though at the end of the day, in a lot of ways it's similar to 6-3 and my life hasn't changed that much.\n\nI hope that helps, but I seriously wouldn't worry too much about nuanced differences between majors at different schools. Applying to colleges is a stressful and scary process, but it at least is only asking you very general questions: what approximate field do you want to enter, what kind of people do you want to live/work with, where might be a nice place to live? I'm one random opinion, but I would absolutely suggest focusing on those!:)",

Also, you are totally right with the advice haha. I think I'm just focused on making sure I get exactly what I want out of college, but in the end that is less important than making sure I get into college in general. Thank you for the advice, and even if you're one random opinion, I'll be sure to keep it in mind as I move forward in the college application process! Thank you again!!!!",

After a couple days my officemate asked me to not bring my gym clothes in the office, explaining he thought that was the smell. I was, of course, rather offended, because the clothes didn't smell at all (I even asked a neutral third party), but I did acquiesce to ease his mind.\n\nTurns out the smell was from a mouse dying in the wall -_-\n\nNot sure what's worse, the smell itself, or the fact that my officemate thought my gym clothes might be causing that smell....",

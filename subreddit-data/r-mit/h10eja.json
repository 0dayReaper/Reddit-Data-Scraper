Elsevier's business model depends on yearly cash injections from university subscriptions; if MIT is the start of a chain of universities dropping them, that would be a serious threat to Elsevier's solvency. \n\nElsevier definitely needs MIT more than MIT needs Elsevier - I'd imagine we'll have access in some form or another before too long.",

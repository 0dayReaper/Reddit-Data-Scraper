I asked if he remembered me and as I walked towards him, he put in his hand in his jacket and said stop, I got a gun. I called bs and said if you had gun, why don\u2019t you pull it out and just take my money?  He rambled about not being a fool, blah blah blah, then he just walked away facing us slowly until he was out of sight.  This was on Beacon &amp; Mass Ave.",

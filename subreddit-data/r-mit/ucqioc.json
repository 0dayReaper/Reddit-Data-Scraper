The website is *filled* with dark patterns asking you to spend money and I can't find a way to just take the course for free.\n\nIs there a different website to get out of this 2U ecosystem and just take 6.0001? Like, how MITx was supposed to function?",

I\u2019m not sure that the interface is as nice as EdX, but it\u2019s better than OCW.",

Graded assignments were no longer free and auditors could only access courses for a limited time window.  This happened long before the 2U acquisition (2021).  Fair to say that edX was not financially sustainable (even by non-profit standards) and changes had to be made.\n\nSecond, [neither MIT nor Harvard took or profited from the $800 million](https://news.mit.edu/2021/mit-harvard-transfer-edx-2u-faq-0629).   Instead that money was put into a surviving non-profit now called [The Center for Reimagining Learning](https://openedx.org/blog/the-open-edx-project-at-the-center-for-reimagining-learning/).  Among others, this non-profit will continue enhancing Open edX, the software platform behind edX.",

It's just that the benefits are accrued by individuals not affiliated to MIT-Harvard.\n\nIt is great that the $400 mil did not go into the pooled endowment but the global benefit of retaining edX as a non profit was pretty clear. Time will tell if Center for reimagining learning will produce a net benefit as compared to retaining edX.",

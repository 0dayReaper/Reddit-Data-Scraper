    "postText": "Feel like this is probably a few days too late but now that a lot of us are presumably SOL, I figured I'd make a thread here to hopefully make something out of a bad situation. Got the idea from an offhand comment in another post. \n\nThrow your top choices of dorms with desired roomtypes in the comments. Hopefully any MIT student who elects to end their housing or needs a new roommate can see this thread and check the comments to find someone whose preferences match to do a one-for-one swap which I have to imagine is possible.\n\nSimilarly, if you find a place in the local area or want to rent a place with someone, you can at least use this place to coordinate.\n\nPrefs (Efficiency followed by 2-person):\n1 Ashdown Eff\n2 Warehouse\n3 SP Eff\n4 Ashdown 2-person\n5 SP 2-person\n\nIf looking for city housing, would be looking for one roommate (2Bed/2Bath - can do 2300$/month)",

Interests in order: programming, reading, plants, the occasional video game/tv show/anime in that order. Biggest sticking point is mid-transition MtF.\n\nPrefer 2-3 roommates and unfurnished if possible, but flexible. Buildings preferred: Edgerton 3/4 bd, Ashdown 3 bd apt, Tang 2/3/4 bd. \n\nAlso happy to live off campus if someone is looking for a roommate there. Budget is not super high but a little flexible. \n\nHappy to message somewhere if interested/want more info.",

                            "comment": "Editing to add before my rant: I recommend the Harvard-MIT Facebook group. Lot of solid listings on their for subletting at relatively affordable prices compared to the current industry standard. Be prepared to pay in excess of 1500$ minimum if you want your own bathroom in an area within a mile of the school. Similarly, mitoffcampus.com is a solid place to look as well!\n\n/beginrant\n\nYes. \n\nI called and asked that. You'll be told to keep checking the portal DAILY at 10 AM (don't care if you work) as the portal \"updates\" as current residents decide to vacate or inbound applicants cancel their reservation. The first few days, I watched the portal clear out in literal seconds. Each apartment I clicked 15 seconds to 1 minute past 1000 was already \"No longer available\". This entire situation and process is a complete joke, and I'm shocked that it's even legal as it's incredibly discriminatory - if not in nature - then in practice. \n\nMy understanding - and please someone correct me if I'm wrong - was if you were someone who worked during the day or were an international student and thus couldn't/didn't feel it necessary to access the portal right at 10 AM EST, then yes. You were totally screwed.\n\nSimilarly, if you were a senior undergrad at MIT staying for graduate school and you were on their network at the time it opened, you not only were much more likely to be available at 10, but also were actually able to access the portal unlike the rest of the world who got locked out. This may be wrong,  but sure seems to be the case based on the current students I've spoken to. \n\nIt's a bit of a gut punch and complete BS in my opinion. But rather than admit a mistake and revert to the lottery - a tried and true method - we're stuck looking for housing in the worst, most inflated, American housing market in decades with (ironically) now-deflated savings. (No, not being political, just stating the reality). Alternatively, they could have just lotteried the individual units so you only enter your name in the hat of units' you're specifically interested in. \n\nThis entire system was clearly designed with current MIT students and residents in mind. It very much failed to account for how popular on-campus housing would be and failed to account for the rest of us on the day 99% of the housing went and hasn't backtracked since.\n\nSo yes, screwed. \n\n/endrant\n\nYes, I'm mad bro to anybody that wants to ask.",

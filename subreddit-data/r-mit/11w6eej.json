    "postText": "Hey guys! I\u2019m considering attending MIT this upcoming fall as a course 7 major on the premed track. I was wondering the following:\n\n1. Is it harder for \u201cpremeds\u201d to make friends given that most people at mit are majoring in course 6 and other tech related majors?\n2. How hard is the rigor of being a premed student + the MIT rigor?\n3. Although MIT is my \u201cdream school,\u201d would I be better off choosing another school (unc ch) which is more \u201csuitable\u201d for premeds + I was given a full ride? (For context, I would be nearly ~$130k in debt attending mit)\n\nI\u2019d appreciate any &amp; all opinions as deciding on a school has been very difficult for me!\n\nAlso, i\u2019m dead-set on premed so I\u2019m not intending on switching majors or career paths during college.",

Although yes I\u2019m sure you might have an easier time in another school with some of the classes I also think you should be thinking more about whether the school is right for you in other ways because every class here is doable with enough effort (There are a lot if great resources especially for premeds). Maybe you really like the build culture (maker spaces) or just the lifestyle. I really suggest you come to CPW and then decide for yourself. There are a couple Premed events where you can talk to premed students and ask about their experiences. It was definitely helpful to me and I hope it will help you out too :).",

            "comment": "In my opinion, if your goal is to get into medical school, you cannot go 130k into debt from undergrad. You need to be debt free or have as little as possible because medical school is 200-300k easily. UNC-CH is a fantastic school and more than good enough to get you into whatever medical school you\u2019d like. Medical schools care about your MCAT, GPA, research, extracurriculares, etc. much more than the name of your undergrad institution, and even then I don\u2019t think they would weigh MIT that much higher than UNC. Take on a little debt as you can, 130k before medical school is crazy",

A common complaint from MIT premeds is that they feel at a disadvantage due to grade deflation here.",

Premed, it should be comparable to most schools.  Not sure how UNC works, but could also just be more difficult given the amount of premeds UNC has.  Ultimately, apart from grades/MCAT (which I\u2019m sure you will do fine with), it\u2019s the diversity of the candidate that may push you over the edge (because your experience at MIT is probably different than most premeds gunning at large state schools).\n\n3.  Debt is tricky.  However, it\u2019s hard to know if you would want to pursue medicine still in four years.  I thought I did, but I also did not want to spend my 20s without financial freedom.  MIT gives you the flexibility to pursue what you want.  \n\nIf instead of UNC, the school was like Brown/Dartmouth/Vanderbilt I would say to for sure go there.  Small class sizes + close ties to the medical school, relatively prestigious/competitive (close ties meaning, you did research under professor X, professor X helps with admissions at your med school/is close with professor Y who helps with admissions).  Not saying this is right, but it happens more than you think.\n\nDebt-wise, I think 200-300k vs 300k-400k is pretty marginal.  Would you work one more year as an attending to go to MIT?\n\nAlso MD PhD programs are funded, if you would be interested in that.",

Smaller courses and classes make it easier to get to know people as you see them more, but have fewer people to meet and see if you connect with.\n\nThat said, if you are pre-med, ask yourself what MIT brings to the table? Do you want to do medical research eventually? Do something that draws on a deep STEM background? Then an MIT foundation brings a lot to the table. Do you want a diploma that gets you into med school, and don't care about the details? 130k is a nice amount of debt not to have.",

Their reasoning is that students get a confidence boost from being a big fish in a small pond versus a confidence hit from struggling to get by at a competitive school.\n\nThe only exception was in black and Latino students who are discriminated against throughout their careers but are theorized to be somewhat shielded from the worst discrimination because of a brand name school on their resumes.",

I\u2019m scared to do my assignments because I don\u2019t have faith I can actually do it. Maybe other people can do it because they\u2019re smarter or more competent. The thing is I\u2019m a senior and I was way more confident in myself as a freshman. I have so much emotional baggage to deal with when it comes to academics from this place I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll ever fix all of them.",

Contact S\\^3\n\nThe you're not alone part: I felt this way too. My friends felt this way. Most people in my classes felt this way. The thing is, people are very good at hiding it. Hell, I bet some people who know you don't know you're feeling this way. This is textbook imposter syndrome, and almost everyone has it, so don't feel bad that you do.\n\nThe S\\^3 part: I'll admit: I thought S\\^3 was lame at first. I thought that's where all the stupid people who can't deal with life go. But it's also a fact that most students end up going to S\\^3 at some point, and it's almost never the people who \"are stupid and can't deal with life.\" There isn't any stigma to S\\^3 because they're just here to help you connect with the resources you need: for you, it's probably just going to be talking to the people there for like 30 minutes and you'll feel so much better.\n\nSo, don't think you're alone, and go to S\\^3. Advice (i.e. pieces of information that can help you) can only come from someone who can talk to you IRL.",

I got a 36 out of 100 on a test at MIT where the average was 62 (and someone who never once attended class got a 96).  It sucked. But I studied and learned and eventually got a B in the class. And at the end of the day, I got the same degree as everyone else.  Most importantly, I learned how to ask questions and how to learn. You are gonna be fine.",

I think it\u2019s really important to understand that you\u2019re not the only one who feels this way; what your feeling is super super common. When everyone\u2019s a genius, nobody is. \n\nI really recommend trying to talk to your friends or going to s3 for some support. I was having similar issues last year, and my friends and s3 were both really helpful. If you want to talk to someone else or don\u2019t feel comfortable with s3 or ppl you know, please dm me.",

    "postText": "Does anybody happen to have solutions to the Problem Solving Practice problems from this version of 8.02 on MIT OCW: [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2019/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2019/)?\n\nThe course is a little weird in that you can't see the answers to the Problem Solving Practice problems until you enter the correct solution, so if you get stuck on one you can't take a look at the solution to see what is tripping you up.\n\nIn particular I'm looking for the answer to problem #5 from Week 2 of Electrostatics.",

    "postText": "Hi, was wondering if anyone knew anything/anyone in MIT\u2019s SMACT (master\u2019s of science in Art, Culture, Technology). How is the program, and how much does it differ from getting an MFA? I can only find out so much from its website and haven\u2019t seen much about it elsewhere, but it seems really intriguing. Anything helps, thanks!!",

            "comment": "I think a major difference is the academic focus. While an MFA program typically places a stronger emphasis on artistic production and studio skills, the MSACT includes critical inquiry, academic writing, and interdisciplinary research (big emphasis on research-based artistic practices and experimentation). You\u2019ll likely draw from various fields such as cultural studies, media studies, architecture, and design.\n\nIn terms of careers, the MSACT may be more attractive to students interested in critical analysis, research, curation, teaching, and cultural production.\n\nIf you want specifics about the exact classes that the degree requires, you can see that at catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/master-art-culture-technology/ .\n\n(undergrad minoring in Design and concentrating in ACT. take what I say with a grain of salt.)",

    "postText": "I would have definitely applied this year, but the website says that they\u2019re not accepting applications for Fall 2023. It\u2019s very cryptic imo [https://idm.mit.edu/admissions/](https://idm.mit.edu/admissions/) It also says they\u2019re integrating with the rest of the school and making their classes open to everyone, but what does that *really* mean, y\u2019know?\n\nI\u2019m still planning to take their classes, but I\u2019m curious if the shift that led to paused admissions has impacted the faculty in IDM, funding for their projects, etc. and what that means for the future. Any insight would be appreciated.",

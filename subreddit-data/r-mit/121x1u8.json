    "postText": "I was recently accepted into the class of \u201827 and submitted my application without requesting for aid. My parents told me not to apply because they initially thought we wouldn\u2019t be eligible to receive anything but now they want me to apply regardless because of tuition costs. My question is will this affect my admissions decision? Can I just submit my FAFSA now or would I have to get in contact with the Financial Services first?",

But there were defined deadlines by which FAFSA and CSS forms were supposed to be submitted if you wanted to be considered for any aid. I would expect they\u2019ll just tell you that the deadline for aid passed by, but again it never hurts to try, it might work out! Good luck :)",

    "postText": "Hello! Kind of an odd question here. I'm a student at Northeastern University nearby and I'm really interested in nuclear energy and similar topics but its not something I've seen discussed a lot here. I was wondering if anyone knew of any open lectures in nuclear or related fields / professors that teach in these subjects. I would love to get in contact with any professors / students or sit in on some of these lectures just for the knowledge. \n\nIf there is anyone in the MIT community who has any information I'd be greatly appreciative. I'd also be interested in meeting / talking to anyone studying these fields. \n\nThanks in advance for any information anyone can provide!",

I'm currently auditing 22.74, a graduate course about radiation damage in nuclear materials. I also began auditing 22.63 (fusion reactor engineering), but had to drop it due to the times interfering with my research.\n\nFeel free to message me to discuss this further.",

            "comment": "MIT Professor Michael Short is on a few videos on Youtube that are really good.  They are excerpts from MIT Course 22.01, the introductory course for Nuclear Science and Engineering.  I'm not sure but there may be overlap with the EdX course linked in another comment.  It's literally the course content on Youtube.  You can search his name to find them.\n\nMIT does have a pathway for \"listeners\" in courses.   It requires the permission of the instructor of the course, and it's somewhat discouraged due to capacity limits on MIT courses.  Listeners don't get a grade or credit.  Also no homework.  They may or may not be given access to the course's Canvas site, that requires jumping a few hoops.  It depends a lot on the instructor and department.  If you want to attend a course as a listener, reach out to the course instructor and see if they are willing.",

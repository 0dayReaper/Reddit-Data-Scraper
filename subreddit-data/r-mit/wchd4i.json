Most people wont sublet their place unless they're gone for a least a month, and there's no reason someone would be vacating their apartment for just some random days in October since that's not a school break here.\n\nYou should look at hotels and AirBNBs. The earlier you book the better prices will be (though be aware they are still not cheap around here). Holding out for a sublet is IMO unrealistic.",

There are usually people subletting their rooms for months, sometimes weeks. Though I think the odds for those specific dates would be incredible low. If all else fails, Airbnb a room.",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I got accepted into MIT last weekend and I was, unsurprisingly, over the moon about it. But as I've started to let it sink in a bit more, I've started to get really intimidated by the prospect of going here. I'm not sure if I'll be able to handle the coursework, I'm not sure if the fast pace of everything is gonna leave me behind...\n\nDid any of you guys have this same feeling before you committed? Are things as difficult as you thought they would be? Is there a type of person who you would say shouldn't come here for college? Any thoughts would be really helpful! Thanks in advance :)",

My biggest struggles at MIT were:\n\n1) Time management and getting distracted when I should have been focusing on labs and psets. This led me to stay up late, which made it even harder to focus.\n\n2) An angsty long distance relationship which ended the week before exams my Sophomore year.\n\n3) Bouts of writing anxiety which caused me to fail a history class (I love history) and graduate a year late.\n\n&gt; Is there a type of person who you would say shouldn't come here for college?\n\nSomeone who is cannot tolerate cold weather without falling into an all-day stupor.

Good sources on this skill include [Thomas Frank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVajQPuRmk8), [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/), and this book by MIT social science alum [Erik Fogg](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Crush-College-Erik-Fogg-ebook/dp/B00GBJCJTE/ref=sr_1_1). Yes, much \"how to do well at uni\" advice has marketing that is overly-focused on grades rather than learning, but the realities of task/energy/attention/time management remain the same.There is also a skill to learning itself. It which is worth spending a weekend on [this free coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). \n\nAssess your mental health and how you operate under stress. Understand your weaknesses and streinghts. Build systems and habits *now* so that when you fall back into those habits, they help you succeed. You might find https://www.betterhelp.com/ or https://www.coach.me/ to be useful here.\n\n-----\n\nMIT taught me many deeply useful things, introduced me to some of the best people I've ever met, and if /r/cscareersquestions is any indication, left me with a ridiculous amount of privilege in terms of the ability to get job interviews. But boy could I have better prepared myself mentally for it if I'd known where to ask for guidance.",

From my perspective, I had high school friends I thought were smarter than me, and if they couldn\u2019t get in, how could I be able to handle it?\n\nFreshman year was ok, my high school prepared me well for the general science/math classes and I pretty much sailed through. Sophomore year wrecked me, there were times when I thought I shouldn\u2019t have gone here, but there were also times where I saw the community of MIT, and the wonderful people I\u2019ve met here. I wouldn\u2019t change my decision to go to MIT, but there are for sure times where this place will really push you to your limits. I\u2019m honestly grateful for that because it has made me reevaluate my values and appreciate the joys of the parts of life outside of work/learning so much more (as cheesy as that sounds).

Even outside of classes, there's a sense of pushing the envelope that's really exhilarating and unique.\n\nTo answer your follow-up question, OP (u/The1AndOnlyJZ): I personally find my work incredibly enjoyable, mostly because I find my field so freaking cool.

In fact, I think that nationwide something like 60-70% of college students change majors at one point or another. To be honest, most high schoolers (at least speaking for myself in high school) have no idea what different majors *truly* study until you get to college - don't sweat it.\n\nJust be sure that you eventually land someplace that makes you happy! :)",

Tbh, if you got in there\u2019s a great chance you\u2019ll survive as long as you don\u2019t join too many clubs or take too many classes, or simply overestimate your capabilities. The biggest problem at MIT In my opinion is the work-life balance or the lack thereof. Everyone here loves talking about work all the time and is in the college bubble. There are very few people that want to have meaningful conversations about politics, society or even what\u2019s going on outside the classroom. The first few months here were depressing tbh, until I just got used to it.",

Also honest answer: getting through doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll necessarily \u201cexcel\u201d or be a top student if that\u2019s important to you. Regardless you\u2019ll get value out of the experience for sure and you\u2019re still be a super brilliant capable person. I personally appreciate some of the extreme challenge and learning to be ok with feeling relatively mediocre. \n\nStaying healthy and well is really hard but not impossible. The culture definitely doesn\u2019t help. I don\u2019t think sacrificing this was worth it to me.\n\nIf you have unconventional life circumstances for an elite school (low income, first generation, caregiver responsibilities, etc) your experience will be different (read: worse) than 90% of students. These institutions severely lack support for us. It is what it is.\n\nThat being said I met some of the best people in my life there. That was definitely what made it the most worth it to me. If you end up going, don\u2019t lose sight of this. Life isn\u2019t really worth anything without meaningful relationships. You\u2019ll still find some shitty people just like anywhere else - don\u2019t fall for the trap that everyone\u2019s amazing just cuz they got there.\n\ntldr; really depends what your priorities are and what\u2019s worth it to you.",

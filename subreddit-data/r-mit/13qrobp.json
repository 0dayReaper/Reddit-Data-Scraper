You may have trouble with some of the core courses for the major, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find others to be easier than the average cheme (numerical methods for example). Also, the qualifying exam will test you on your knowledge of chemical kinetics before you get a chance to take a class on it. All hope is not lost, but parts of the experience will be an uphill battle. \n\nI would also say that there is nothing stopping you from getting admitted in math or physics and then being advised/co advised by a cheme faculty member. There are even advisors with joint appointments in other departments like math. \n\nI\u2019d just ask why you want to pivot to cheme and not go through the other route. I\u2019d try to explain that in your essay.",

            "comment": "PhD programs tend to have specific entry requirements that differ widely by institution and major. Rarely are they specific about undergraduate major, but instead about the coursework you took in the relevant subjects. So depending on how one programs feels about this, they may literally not care at all, or possibly be very specific. For instance, some departments effectively assume that you \\*cannot\\* have majored in their subject because the number of undergraduate programs in that subject is close to zero. Other departments regularly recruit from related fields. In many cases, PhD programs start with master's classes, so it's largely a moot point because they're going to make you take the graduate version of the classes anyways, so all they care about is appropriate background and generic aptitude. You'll need to find out on a school-by-school basis.",

            "comment": "Talk directly with any PI in your dream program at MIT would be more useful. Ask directly about this. But from my experience as a PhD candidate here i feel it depends more on whether the admission committee members feel confident about your excellence. For example if you major in Chem but spent 3 years on bio research and got solid publications in bio. you might be able to get in bio programs. But if you have references from big names in the Chem community, it won\u2019t work out for bio. I only know about chem and bio. Also consider the size and academic diversity of the program cohort. Some programs are small and the research is not diverse. Thumb rule: have at least 3 PIs in the program who are confident to recognize your excellence, and who will be willing to take you as student for strongly matching background or strongly matching interest.\nMyself have a case at Stanford. I major in Chem, I have two references from Chem and one from a prof who does BioE. I applied to BioE because I found a few PIs who have strong connections to my reference, and they could also evaluate my work. I also expressed overlapping research interest several times. End of the day, I didn\u2019t proceed to the Stanford interview. I got through everything smoothly at MIT Chem (that is the same as my major) and I think multiple committee members voted for me although I did not do related research. But I am international and internationals had a hard time during the pandemic at Stanford.",

    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m going to be a student at MIT next year\u2014would you be able to give me advice for ranking dorms, please?\n\nI prefer D&amp;D, card/board games, karaoke and weird TV shows to sports or typical partying. I have a sensory processing disorder so I would prefer not to be somewhere that\u2019ll always be loud at night or that has an unusual smell. I have difficulty socializing and am relatively young, so I want live in a dorm that will make it easier to socialize but also won\u2019t overwhelm me with constant interaction. I want to live in a double if it\u2019s possible but I\u2019d be fine with a single or I guess a triple\u2014Maseeh quads terrify me though. I have a limited diet and will get a meal plan, so while I\u2019m okay living in a cook for yourself dorm I don\u2019t want to be somewhere I\u2019d be required or pressured to participate in community cooking and grocery funds. I\u2019m queer and will avoid anywhere that can be antagonistic to the LGBTQ+ community, but I definitely don\u2019t feel I have to be somewhere that has a specific queer reputation, like Random.\n\nDo you have any suggestions on what I should rank highly and what I should avoid? I know I can\u2019t have everything I want a dorm, but it seems like a lot of the quirkiest and most tight-knit dorms are also the most overwhelming, which gives me a difficult choice.\n\nThank you for any help you can give me, and I\u2019m sorry for the long post!\n\nTL;DR: Looking for quirky, queer-friendly dorms with strong community that like geeky stuff but aren\u2019t overwhelming or loud and don\u2019t involve required communal cooking/groceries. Please help me rank them.",

            "comment": "It sounds like Simmons would be the place for you! Very geeky/nerdy, social with the lounge culture but not at all overwhelming, artsy, very queer friendly in my experience. We have karaoke nights, puzzles, TV show watch nights, but it\u2019s very quiet at nights and the rooms are clean and calm. The lounge culture makes it easy to socialize when you want IMO, and there\u2019s plenty of events happening throughout the building, like study breaks. We have a dining hall in the dorm but also plenty of kitchens.\n\nCan\u2019t speak for the other dorms cause I don\u2019t live there. Hope this helps!",

            "comment": "i\u2019ll go through them alphabetically briefly\n\nbaker - probably too normie. \n\nburton-connor - depends on your floor and living group, i don\u2019t know them all well enough to rank them all. there\u2019s probably a couple you\u2019d like but definitely not all of them\n\nec - closed :( \u2014 there\u2019s definitely halls you\u2019d like if it was still open but it is not unfortunately.\n\nmacgregor - not super social, you probably wouldn\u2019t hate it but odds are it would be pretty meh. also, the rooms are really small.\n\nmaseeh - somewhat the same as macgregor, but different rooming situation. also, it has the most accommodating dining hall (in terms of variety and dietary accommodation, they\u2019re the only dining hall that always has gluten fee option, vegan options, kosher and halal options, etc all at once, which also means there\u2019s always a lot of variety in general). but still, not super social as far as i can tell.\n\nmcc - non-coed housing can be a bit weird because you\u2019re living with people who decided they only wanted to live with other people of the same gender as them. there\u2019s a lot of varying reasons why people make that choice, so consider it with that in mind. it\u2019s very different from every other dorm for that reason alone. also, the dining hall can be very good but has very little variety (as in, they might have a really good meal option for the day but if you don\u2019t like it you have to go somewhere else for an alternative).\n\nnew house - i\u2019ve heard good things about it but don\u2019t know enough to really rank it. i was considering moving there next year since ec is closing, but i didn\u2019t get placed there. also, the cultural houses are pretty interesting but you should look into them individually if you\u2019re interested. \n\nnew vassar - social scene pretty much doesn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s just too new and doesn\u2019t have an established culture. it\u2019s similar to dorms at most colleges in that way i think, where any socialization is limited to circumstance and if you bring your friends with you. \n\nnext house - very friendly to board games and your other interests, but not super queer. it\u2019s not hostile, just very straight. but that kind of goes without saying for a lot of the more \u2018normie\u2019 dorms, i\u2019m only mentioning it here because next is much less normie but still not queer\n\nrandom - super small and queer and tight-knit. you\u2019d probably like it, it\u2019s way less overwhelming than east campus. but it\u2019s also hard to join because of how small it is, even if you rank it first. \n\nsimmons - again, i don\u2019t know it very well, but i think it\u2019s probably the queerest of all the meal plan dorms. you\u2019d probably like it, though i don\u2019t know much about their culture. they definitely have more of a culture than dorms like maseeh and baker, imo.\n\nalso, no dorms downright require communal cooking or groceries. you won\u2019t really be ostracized from opting out of that if you end up in a living group that has that as an option, my hall has weekly baking nights and i don\u2019t participate because i\u2019m not one for baking but i still go to hang out and we have fun and i still get to eat some of the baked goods. you only have to contribute to things like groceries in independent living groups, which are distinct from dorms and generally student-led.",

            "comment": "I think Random Hall would be a viable choice! We are a very tight knit community with a healthy following of D&amp;D players and board and card game enthusiasts. I was even offered to play in a D&amp;D group over the summer. Many people here are very considerate of your needs, and we have policies on floors to keep the noise down, such as not playing piano past 11pm. We are also very serious with accommodating food intolerances and allergies. For instance, Bonfire is a floor that strictly doesn't allow any nuts or mushrooms at any time (airborne allergies). Random Hall will by far be the queerest dorm, with either Burton Conner or Simmons behind. I have heard things about queer people getting harrassed at Maseeh, and some queer people I know moved out of Maseeh to Random and are enjoying their time much more now. With these reasons, and also since you don't want to stay in a quad, I may avoid Maseeh if I were you. Baker is also a very \"straight\" dorm. You would be given a double room if you were to move to Random (we don't have anything above a double), but you may also be able to move into a small half (small single) if you change your mind.\n\nThere is no pressure to not get a meal plan, and no one has to do \"community grocery funds.\" You pay a small tax at the beginning of the semester, which is used for hall funding in general, not food. Some frosh I know are on one, and a walk to dining at Maseeh, New Vassar, or Simmons wouldn't be far. My floor commonly goes to late night dining, in fact. We also have a ton of restaurants conveniently located near Random if you want a meal for effectively half the price of a meal swipe too, and many of the places can accommodate food restrictions (vegan, gf, allergies, etc.).\n\nBTW, interaction levels vary among floors. Black Hole is much more \"social\" with others, and Clam can be loud at times at night, I'd say, but Loop, BMF, and Bonfire are very much more mellow in those regards. Pecker and Destiny are quite chill too.\n\nI have also stayed at Simmons for a bit during CPW, and the place seems very chill, and their stir fry, oftentimes, is amazing. There are low noise levels at night. The rooms are quite nice with quirky, sponge-inspired desks and other furniture. I have a few queer friends who live there. However, I am personally not as big a fan of Simmons just because I enjoy the home-y feel of Random more, with the situation at Simmons feeling more like a hotel, but it is very much my opinion.\n\nYou may have noticed this, but there is a general trend that the more \"counterculture,\" \"geeky,\" and queer a hall is, the less likely they are to have meal plans, so you will have to find a balance.\n\nAnyway, if you have any questions about Random Hall, I am free to answer them!",

    "postText": "I personally feel like its a huge downgrade.  I loved the old library.  It was my favorite study space on campus.  I could work surrounded by books that were relevant to my work.  It was inspiring.  Also cozy because you could kind of hide in the stacks.  \n\nThey replaced this with what basically amounts to two big rooms with tables and a cafe.   Most of the remaining books seem to be completely unrelated to anything I'd need in my work.  Novels, graphic novels, reading material that I could use (although I never have...) if I wanted to take a break, but they don't enhance the actual experience of working in any way.  The only section that has been improved, in my opinion, is the hallway that connects the library to the non-library part of building 14.\n\nMaybe most scientists and engineers don't care about these things.  Harvard downgraded their science library (and as far as I'm aware, only their science library) in this manner, too.  But I found the changes to be depressing.  I've tried to give the new space a chance, but it's just worse, imo.",

I went to the renovated Hayden for the first time recently, and my first though was \"Where are all the books?\" Turns out, what's left of the stacks are hidden away in the basement, as though MIT is somehow ashamed of physical books.\n\nOTOH, the basement isn't changed very much, except that the old-school bookshelves have been replaced by those moving bookcases. So you can still hide out in the stacks.",

Having a cafe is a big plus on this side of campus even if the offerings are not perfect.

I like that there are more group study spaces and you don't have to be first in the door to have any hopes of getting a room. I like the different set-ups that allow more people to enjoy the space for studying, writing, working together. The variety caters to a more diverse population who have different study and working styles. The courtyard is a huge update that I wish I had more time to use because it is absolutely beautiful.",

They just kept avoiding it by either discussing what incoming students (who hadn\u2019t been on campus) had said in a questionnaire or talking about how \u201cpeer institutions\u201d require everyone to be on a meal plan. To me the real problem was the DSL director though",

I meant to explain myself more in my question. \n\nI was curious if anyone had heard any actual data. \n\nWhat happened to the kids who were at SH when it was shut down? \n\nDid anyone do an analysis of overall grad rate prepandemic to see if it went up after SH closed?\n\nWas there some kind of predictive modeling to tell who would have chosen senior house, where they ended up living after its closure, and what are they graduated?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "First, it\u2019s important to understand that the worst of the statistics coming out of senior haus were at least a decade old at the time.  If your metric of evaluation is \u201cpercent of students graduating within 6 years\u201d, this metric has a good deal of lag.\n\nIn my anecdotal experience, no - the closure probably hurt six-year graduation rates.  And it\u2019s no surprise that such a disruptive event would make it harder.  Making this case with data is tough because: a) it\u2019s a relatively small number of students and b) you need to have some prior guess at what the graduation rate should have been, based on the trends.  \n\nBut more importantly, I think this question represents a fundamental misunderstanding about the administration\u2019s goals.  The administration did not care about helping its current students graduate.  They cared about the liability of having one dorm with a low graduation rate.  MIT can\u2019t be held responsible for a problem it cannot measure, and spreading students out so graduation can\u2019t be easily tracked solves their accounting problem.  Doing any kind of post-closure analysis would be counterproductive to their goals.",

There was also liquid nitrogen ice cream and cool lectures by various professors in the department. I made some of my first friends in that FPOP and we would pset together throughout our time at MIT.",

It was a good introduction to the department and what it has to offer, and the non-academic activities were a nice sampling of a few spots in Cambridge (Toscanini\u2019s, Harvard Square, MIT landmarks) This definitely wasn\u2019t the case for everyone there, but I also made some of my closest MIT friends in DChem.",

There were opportunities to learn more about ChemE in practice through company tours, lab tours in the department, and faculty panels. We also got to learn more about being a ChemE student through a senior panel, an overview of the required classes, a mentor-mentee pairing, and some hands-on ChemE related activities. The fun parts were definitely the outdoor activities we got to do like kayaking and a boston scavenger hunt\"\n\nHope this helps!",

    "postText": "I've been lazy to reconfigure my smart speakers since the MIT Wi-Fi overhaul (I know it's been a minute) and I'm trying to do that today. But I don't know if I can have them hooked up to MIT SECURE, MIT GUEST, or MIT (what's this btw? I have used secure and guest on my phone before but i don't know what this \"MIT\" is. Does anybody know the password?). Has anyone done this? Can you help me with this?",

The \"MIT\" SSID used to be open but now requires an individualized password, which you can obtain from https://wifi.mit.edu/.\n\nThis SSID has specifically been kept around for devices that do not handle enterprise auth (as on MIT SECURE or eduroam) or captive portals (as on MIT GUEST)",

Might\u2019ve just been the model for the Home I tried though, let me know if you figure yours out!",

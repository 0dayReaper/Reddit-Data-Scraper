Prof. Chen is a long-serving and highly respected member of the research community, which makes the government\u2019s allegations against him all the more distressing.

Gang is internationally recognized as a distinguished scholar in the field of heat transfer. As someone who knows Gang well and is deeply appreciative of his contributions to MIT and the Department, I know this news will be quite distressing for many.  \n \nI have reached out to Gang\u2019s family, students and postdoctoral associates, and staff to offer moral support. While I am sure you also want to find ways to offer your support to Gang, given the seriousness of the charges, we should let him be guided by his counsel while this process plays out.\n \nIn the meantime, I want to share resources that are available to you. I encourage faculty, staff, and postdocs who feel they need support to connect with MyLife Services, and students to access any of MIT\u2019s support resources.\n \nSincerely,\nEvelyn\"\n\nLienhard said something similar, along with \"keep in mind that being charged is not the same as being guilty\"......",

If he was a new professor who had just joined MIT a few months ago, in some ways the news would be less distressing.\n\nThe second and third paragraphs are focused on recommending students who need support to reach out to MIT resources. Chen advised PhD students, and now those students have no advisor. That is clearly a distressing position to be in, and I think it's more than reasonable for someone to send out an e-mail recommending resources for affected students to reach out to.\n\nIn fact, the second paragraph specifically mentions \"the seriousness of the charges\".\n\nFinally, pointing out that a charge doesn't necessarily imply guilt is very far off from defending Chen.",

So I was asking if they are arguing something beyond that.\n\nThe article you pasted is informative though. A Homeland Security agent stated:\n\n&gt; I believe DOE would have inquired further to ensure that CHEN\u2019s work for the PRC government and his other PRC affiliations did not pose a significant conflict of interest, a conflict of commitment, or other impediment to his DOE-funded work.\n\nSo unless his advisory role was taking up a huge time commitment, it seems likely that he would have still received the DOE grant, except if they determined it posed a conflict of interest (which would be strange since this is regarding research that will be published publicly). (It's certainly possible that his advisory roles were a huge time commitment though, maybe that explains the arrest and these charges. I just got the impression that it was a small side thing, and that the $29M was separate research funding and not personal salary.)\n\nAnyway, we will see how the case goes, but it seems like it'll be hard for them to argue that his crime warrants jail time.",

It reminds me of a 2016 documentary: \"Abacus: Small Enough to Jail\", depicting a small Chinese owned community bank being falsely prosecuted by a whole federal justice system and scapegoated for the 2008 subprime crisis. It seems that being a Chinese American in the United States is some kind of sin.",

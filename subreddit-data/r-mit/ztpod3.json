I have trouble completing my tasks because I worry my knowledge and solutions are not MIT quality. How do you all cope with this? I see a lot of very confident self starters and think I need an attitude adjustment to succeed here",

The way to cope with it is to realize every other single human associated with that school felt the same way for a while. I mean I've heard it a million times. I've heard it from the loneliest freshman to this man who ran a program at a huge State University and then transferred to \"just plain staff\" over there at mit. I've heard it from provosts... I've heard it from deans... I've heard it from 20-year alums...",

Almost everyone feels imposter syndrome at one point or another in life (the quoted stat is 70% but it seems like it would be higher).  \n\nFirst, start reinforcing your wins and the hard things you've done before in life.  What made you qualified to get hired at MIT?  What challenges/accomplishments have you overcome to arrive where you are?\n\nIf that doesn't help, therapy or coaching can help.  You can also try a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy workbook to address those beliefs about yourself/your work.  Feel free to DM me, if you would like any more specific guidance \ud83d\ude0a",

All of this!\n\nMy department has a two week onboarding for new students before the term and one of the best sessions they did was an hour and a half about imposter syndrome and ways to deal with it. But one of the biggest take aways: they know what they are doing when they take you in (as a student or as staff). They have decades of data as to what makes a good professor, researcher, student and talk to thousands of people. If you couldn't hack it, you wouldn't have been offered the opportunity to interview, let alone the position!\n\nAlso: literally everyone has this experience, but many don't talk about it. We were encouraged to talk to each other, our professors, our TAs, whomever when we were feeling like we shouldn't be there, and all of them absolutely lifted each other up. It was seriously one of the most supportive groups I've ever been a part of (in industry, academia, etc) - and IMO it is no doubt this sense of physiological safety that they taught,  encouraged, and exampled for us that made us thrive in and out of the program and makes that program amazing.\n\nAnyway, you rock and good luck!",

The people around you aren't nearly as infallible as it seems when everyone puts their best foot forward socially. Other than this, I find it to be effective to do your work for yourself. If that is your motivation, you'll care less about what other people think of it as long as you're getting something out of it yourself",

For me it was freshman year in particular because I felt like everything from bigger cities and the coasts had gone to these way more advanced high schools and learned so much more. You kind of settle in as you go though and things get natural. It took me a while to learn that lesson too and not take every mistake or failure to heart and remember that everyone makes mistakes sometimes",

I am sorry you are feeling this way, and I hope the advice I can offer is helpful (sending it with a very large hug).\n\nLike others have said, the feelings you are having are very common, especially at MIT. Take a deep breath, and let's walk through. Yes, the people who surround you are dazzling brilliant and capable -- and they chose you to be on their team. Hiring happens based on group input and consensus. And this group chose you.\n\nThey chose you because they think you add value to their team. They think you add value either because (1) you already know everything, or (2) even though you don't know everything, you have other skills, like curiosity and collaboration, that the team needs. \n\nThey did not hire you because you know everything. Nobody knows everything. And those who think they do are harmful to any enterprise. \n\nThey hired you because there is something unique that you bring. Your task now is to zero in on what that thing is, and focus on bringing it. Go back over your interview process, conversations you had -- what were some things you got positive feedback on, that made you the best candidate? At that time, why did you think MIT should hire you?\n\nTalk to people, your supervisor and anyone else on your team you admire. Let them know how happy you are to be on the team, let them know that you want to add value, and ask them what, from their perspective, you can be doing (today, over the next month, and over the next three months) to best provide that? \n\nBest of luck to you, and feel free to DM if you want to talk more!",

I would suggest talking about it with a professional.  When I have anxiety I also take magnesium in the form of magtein or magnesium glycinate.  I tend to do a lot of presentations in front of high ranking audiences and it really helps calm me down.",

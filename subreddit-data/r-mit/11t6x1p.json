    "postText": "Hey everyone, I was looking at one of the MIT Masters programs. This particular program has a requirement that you must maintain a 4.5/5.0 GPA to remain eligible.\n\nGiven MIT\u2019s academic reputation (of being rigorous but rewarding), is this something achievable if you do your work and put in the expected amount of effort? As you can tell, I didn\u2019t go to undergrad here, so wasn\u2019t sure how attainable that is.",

            "comment": "It definitely takes a lot of work to do well in MIT grad classes and I don\u2019t want to undermine that, but honestly grad classes are much more forgiving grade wise than undergraduate even though the material is harder. This is true at most universities, but you really feel it at MIT where undergrad classes are still so hard but unforgiving. In an extreme example I got a 60% average in a difficult grad class and the professor gave me a B. I truly think getting a 4.5 in grad classes is more doable than it may sound, and much easier than getting 4.5 undergrad.",

The logic is that if you're taking the class you must be actively interested in learning the material, so there's not much need to grill you on it and test if you learned - if you failed to learn, you're the one that wasted your time not gaining the info you set out to gain. As long as you make a clear effort submitting the assignments and showing up to class you should get an A.\n\nResults may vary.",

Some people, some programs view getting a B is like \u201cfailing\u201d for grad school. In fact I did have to repeat some classes because I got Cs. Legit thought I was going to get kicked out.  My friend in the other hand had a perfect GPA.",

            "comment": "I spent the Covid year (Fall 2020 - Spring 2021) doing a Co-op, and I'm glad I was able to do it then. Most of the classes I would liked to have taken were running in a modified \"virtual version\" which seemed kinda watered down to me. Given that tuition wasn't drastically reduced I determined it'd be the best option.\n\nHonestly it was a good break to stagger my MIT career. I was able to get some professional insights that you simply don't have enough time to get in normal 3-month internships. I definitely think those skills came through in my classwork. I was also able to get a much better sense of whether industry (and particularly the company that I worked at's industry) was right for me. It gave me a new confidence to pursue specific opportunities on campus and attend events that I would otherwise not have known whether they'd be helpful / useful.\n\nI think in general 8-month co-ops, if you're up for it, can be a great way to realign yourself with why you're really here.\n\nHowever, there were some downsides. If you don't like the work, sucks; you're in it for 8 months. I really lucked out and loved my work, and the time flew by much faster than a 3-month summer internship, but I was very fearful for the first month that I might've trapped myself in a corner. Be very sure that the experience you'll get is useful and beneficial to your ability to learn or discern what you want in your career.\n\nSecondly, when returning I was faced with the question of whether I'd need an additional year to complete my major here. This is an important factor, because you essentially stagger yourself from the rest of the class you arrived at MIT with. Maybe with your freshman year being virtual, this feeling is no big deal, but it definitely was for me.\n\nI'd say weigh your options.\n\n*Pros*:  \n\\- Professional experience  \n\\- Realigning your interests  \n\\- Making longer-lasting professional connections  \n\\- Companies typically want to transition Co-Ops to full-time  \n\\- Larger Intern Projects\n\n*Cons:*  \n\\- Isolation from school-friends and your class  \n\\- Risky long commitment  \n\\- Could set your major back \\~ half a year or a year in my case\n\nGood luck!",

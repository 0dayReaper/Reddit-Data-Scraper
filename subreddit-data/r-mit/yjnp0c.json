Dorchester/Roxbury have a reputation as being unsafe; I have no knowledge either way. When I was looking for a place, I found many people who\u2019d lived there for a while and never felt unsafe. \n\nYou probably know this already, but you\u2019ll pay a premium to be near a train station (like within half a mile or so). Pay attention to bus routes on your search \u2014 both the places I\u2019ve lived have been about a mile from the train, but have been super close to a bus that goes straight to the nearest station. Boston is in the process of revamping the bus routes, though, so keep that in mind. \n\nMost importantly, if the apartment looks too good to be true, then it is.",

However, that street fills up FAST in the morning, so you either need to arrive before 7am or after 1pm. Doesn\u2019t help that people regularly park their cars ten feet apart \ud83d\ude44\n\nEdit: while that street is all the way on the east end of campus, MIT has an EZride(?) bus that goes between Lechmere station and somewhere on the other end of campus. So if you wanted to try and park on that street regularly (which I wouldn\u2019t recommend), you could access the rest of campus.",

If you are just staying for the summer, it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to find an efficiency (different story during the term).",

The advice to look off-campus to cut down on costs IMHO only applies if you\u2019re a single student and looking to live in a shared space. For families with a higher need for privacy it\u2019s much more expensive and inconvenient to find it off campus.",

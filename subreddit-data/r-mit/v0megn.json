Does the team only recruit or are there tryouts? I\u2019ve tried searching with little to no luck, and info would be appreciated!",

I have a few friends on sports teams and they're super approachable, alongside the coach.\n\nFind someone on the team and just email them. If you're set up with your MIT email, all you need is a name (in the send to bar, just type out the full name and their email address will show up). \n\nSomeone IRL is going to be more helpful than someone on reddit, and if you ever have questions about anything, just email someone who's relevant.",

And fill out the [recruiting questionnaire](https://questionnaire.acsathletics.com/Questionnaire/Questionnaire.aspx?s%2bAFd6THBgXpybtciQJjw6bytaOp2GyEMOvkHybFf2kLqPjwRIpHarlRSM8RXbod).\n\nI did that as a walk on for women\u2019s basketball years ago, and the coach put me in contact with the captain who was running preseason workouts. Showing up to preseason gave me a sense of how strong the team was and made it easy to hit the ground running.\n\nETA: Generally speaking it isn\u2019t that easy for MIT to recruit, given that coaches don\u2019t get free passes through admissions. So if you\u2019ve been playing soccer since 3, my guess would be that they\u2019d at least be happy to have you try out.",

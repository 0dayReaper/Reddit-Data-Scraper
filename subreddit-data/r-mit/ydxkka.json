Glassblowing as well, but that tends to be really popular.\n\nI might be *slightly* biased as a lit minor, but I loved taking the IAP literature classes. I took 21L.590 and 21L.591 (the former during COVID, so no traveling to Spain, but 591 was held in London. 21L.592 in Brazil launched in IAP 2020 so it's the newest class of the bunch) and they had a really good balance of the 'work hard, play hard' aspect, especially 21L.591. Applications are already closed for this year though, but they're taught annually.\n\nAlso, IAP externships with the Alum Association are great for dipping your toes into another field and connecting with alums!",

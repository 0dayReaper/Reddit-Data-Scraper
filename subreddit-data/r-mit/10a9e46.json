The lectures were recorded and attendance was not mandatory (no clicker questions). Also I found the weekly quizzes last spring to be pretty easy and the exams were overall fair. I put maybe 2-3 hours of work and still came out with a high A just based on prior experience from AP Chem and a little bit of reviewing of the new material from the class each week. I would recommend it",

I would only recommend you take 3.091 if its required for something else you're doing. Maybe look up th professor on ratemyprof or whatever. If he's AMAZING, 3.091 is probably worth it, but otherwise I'd not recommend it.",

            "comment": "tl;dr:   if it\u2019s got slightly more processing power and user friendliness than a literal potato running some awful arcane version of Linux, someone has gotten through course 6 undergrad with it. \n\n\nsubtleties: how much laptop you\u2019ll want really depends on whether you\u2019ll be using remote servers with GPUs for the beefier ML tasks or not. someone with more recent experience can tell you if that\u2019s common now. In general, you want more RAM if you\u2019re doing a lot of ML on your machine (because huge matrices), possibly with a solid nvidia GPU built in (not mac then). some ML libraries are a little unhappy on the newest apple silicon iirc. macs are a little easier to program with most of the time, but once you\u2019re used to getting stuff working on Windows it\u2019s totally doable. and you can always install Linux on your windows machine.\n\n\nother option: some people will have a really solid desktop for big computational tasks plus a lightweight notebook for word processing/notes/portability etc. These are all fairly minor considerations, though, in light of the tl;dr above.\n\n\nin general, just get something reasonably powerful that you\u2019re happy using and that is durable based on reviews. lightweight is always a plus when you\u2019re lugging it home from the library at midnight. don\u2019t overthink it, though - you\u2019ll be just fine.",

            "comment": "I'd recommend getting a personal computer and installing GNU/Linux. (Just get something simple like Ubuntu or Linux Mint if you don't have much experience with Linux.)\n\nLinux will have the most support for your CS classes. For example, there's a class I took this past semester where there was no support for Windows at all and no support for Mac computers with the M1 chip.\n\nYou'll also have an easier time fixing things when they inevitably go wrong, or reconfiguring your system to work with your tools. (E.g., Maybe a certain machine learning library only works with a narrow range of drivers, a specific version of Pytorch, and the correct version of the Nvidia CUDA Toolkit. Good luck getting that set up in Windows/Mac.)\n\nFinally, you'll also make the world a bit better of a place by refusing to bow down to anti-competitive companies like Apple and Microsoft--but that probably isn't one of your priorities lol.",

You just send them a screenshot of the computer you want and they\u2019ll send you the money, no questions asked. \n\nYou can find more info on the SFS site under cost and affordability.",

If you don't have these skills, just beware that folks hiring a mechanical engineer will expect you to have some background in those classes' subject matter. Want to do something with design/manufacturing? make sure you have 2.007 and 2.008 taken. Just don't NOT take a class because you think it may be hard or heard second-hand that it was hard.",

Pick whichever program you like better. You can still say you majored in mechanical engineering either way.",

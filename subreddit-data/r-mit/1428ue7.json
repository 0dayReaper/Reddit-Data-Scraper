    "postText": "Is it at all feasible to join the MIT Men\u2019s Lacrosse Team as an inexperienced walk-on? I\u2019m an incoming freshman (\u201827) who has never played lax before but has held and practiced some maneuvers with a lax stick and observed a good number of lax games this past spring. Is there a process I need to go through? Should I contact the coach? Could someone please give me some guidance? Tennis is my primary sport but I\u2019m bored of it and would like to try something new.",

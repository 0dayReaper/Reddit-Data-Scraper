However, I\u2019ve started doing this, and I feel less confident about my ability to perform well on upcoming tests and midterms because I\u2019m taking so long that I likely won\u2019t get through all the practice problems and I\u2019m not seeing speed improvements to my problem solving in reference to novel questions. Is this feeling normal, and if not, why could this not be working for me?",

            "comment": "This I think is definitely normal when you first get started. The idea behind trying to solve things yourself first before asking for help or looking at the solutions is to get better at recognizing patterns in problems, which will make you a better problem solver in the long run.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with asking for help (going to OH asking a friend) on a question that\u2019s you\u2019ve made a good faith attempt at solving. Because at that point you\u2019re investing enough in the problem so that it\u2019s solution is one you remember.\n\nI suggest revisiting these problems that used to take you a long time and make sure you understood the high level pattern / concepts associated with them. Try solving it in a narrative fashion (like you\u2019re teaching it to someone), and justify each step along the way. Doing this can help you identify gaps in your knowledge.\n\nAt least this was all relevant in my experience as a first year, hopefully this is helpful!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a \u201823, and I\u2019ve finished all my theoretical requirements. I have never once solved a practice problem to test prep in any class. I still do well on tests, and you can too! It\u2019s a style thing.\n\nI learn more efficiently by reading the problem, thinking about how I would do it for not more than 15 min and carefully reading through the solution path. \n\nFor my coursework, all problems are problem solving challenges, and I get more from putting effort into understanding optimal solution paths and logic rather than bashing my head on a wall to get a suboptimal path. I\u2019m busy. If I only have 2 hours to study (often less), I\u2019d like to spend that time getting more insight on rather than messing with the problem specifics.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about going into your first test at MIT, your TAs could be right, speed might be an issue. I still think spending your limited study time on more practice problems will be more helpful. I will say though, I did Sci Oly and Sci UIL in HS and am very used to grinding out questions efficiently, so time hasn\u2019t been a problem.  If the nerves are making you slower, remember ur on PNR and the 8.02 test is gonna be hella curved. The first test average was a 44 or smth when I took it. That  curved to a 70",

But ig this could be said about most study methods",

I think that doing lots of them does really help, but also separating them into clusters of the same \"type\" of problem and tackling them in that way.",

But when you're working on problems, you need to independently come up with the next step, and that's way harder.",

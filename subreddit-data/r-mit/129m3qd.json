    "postText": "I\u2019m an high school student and I want to study quantum physics at university. I\u2019ve been told that MIT is the best in this field, but it is not the most affordable one. Considering that, if I were to be accepted, I\u2019d be a international student in addition to being a woman in STEM, would I receive any scholarships?",

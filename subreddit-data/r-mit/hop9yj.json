    "postText": "Something I don't see come up very often here is the cost of attending MIT. I don't want to dissuade people from attending just because of the cost, but I want to people to be realistic about what that cost looks like after graduating.\n\nWhen I graduated, I owed just shy of $130,000 (of which about $123k was principal). And even this is less than it could have otherwise been, since I did 2 years at a state school and then transferred to MIT for 3 years.\n\nI left my first job with a startup to go to another place for a 20% pay increase because of my loans. Is that the worst thing? Of course not. But I hope this helps someone considering MIT levels of debt understand what that level of debt implies. The spreadsheet linked below shows my payment history over time, and how much money went to interest alone, especially during the first year or two.\n\nETA: I neglected to note that I did have an external scholarship that covered a little under $20k a year.\n\n[spreadsheet with all the details](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kIYz9bE264cvZWhSeSyztVwgVhGjDEFNZFLa9virtBw/)",

I'm sorry you drew such a tough hand on this, but MIT is typically pretty generous when it comes to aid and support. My family wasnt sure we could afford any kind of college, but MIT took care of everything. This might be more normal for grad school costs though, I'm not so sure on that front.  \nEither way, congrats on getting things payed off, I'm sure it's a great feeling to be relieved of $2200 a month, wow",

If you want to continue your education, or be an academic, or go into public service, or do anything other than software/medicine/law/lucrative careers, you really gotta think carefully about how you're gonna manage the costs.\n\nCollege costs are INSANE, and they worsen every year. If you're qualified to attend MIT, you almost certainly can attend a local state school for a substantially lower price (in many cases at no cost). Something all prospective students should consider.\n\nThanks for sharing these details, and congrats on being debt-free!",

Local state schools can also be insane.\n\nMy single mom earned just enough so that I didn't qualify for any state grants to attend a state school (UCLA). I would have had to pay full in state tuition and room and board (~10k) based on the distance from where I lived at the time. My yearly cost was over 20K for a state school including room and board. Even if I eventually lived off campus it would have still be considerably expensive. \n\nMIT gave me just enough Finaid so that it was about 5K a year more than a state school. I went in to the Finaid office to see if they could help a little more and the woman said snidely \"well maybe you should attend a state school\". It  pissed me off so much. When I explained to her the negligible cost difference she said at that point 20k vs 25k a year meant loans either way. She had a point. Was it worth the extra 5k in loans? Absolutely. I think earning potential alone on initial graduation covered it. Also the experience of going to MIT was worth it. \n\nEveryone's circumstances are different and they should definitely consider all their options. But sometimes you might get screwed over if your state school is in a high cost of living area, you're parent is a single parent with one child, and you have to take out large loans either way.",

The only reason anyone would have this amount in loans is if their family does not want to pay the amount of money MIT thinks they should be able to pay.\n\nMy experience with MIT, and other schools, is that the amount of money you are expected to pay is significantly less than the FAFSA EFC (it is relevant that my parents are not divorced, however).  It turns out that the FAFSA EFC is not very hard to follow, especially if you are capable of getting into MIT.  You can find it here - https://ifap.ed.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/2019-10/2021EFCFormulaGuideOct2019UpdateAttach.pdf.  By working through the formula, you can an idea of how MIT might think your family can afford the figure they came up with.  MIT also has a net price calculator here - https://npc.collegeboard.org/app/mit - and it might be useful in figuring out something closer to the exact formula MIT uses.",

Any circumstances in your household that may affect the family's ability to pay that price are not taken into account. They look at household income and quote you a price. Period. If you can't pay it, you don't attend.",

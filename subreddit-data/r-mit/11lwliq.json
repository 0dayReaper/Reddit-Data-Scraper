    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am a non-MITian graduate student who\u2019s coming to Boston for an internship during summer. I heard that MIT has a dorm transfer program for summer and was hoping if someone can help me answer the following queries:\n\n1. Are the dorms availed for non-MITians?\n2. When to apply and how much is the cost per month?\n3. When does the application process begin?\n4. What facilities are available in the dorm unit (are they furnished)?\n\nThank you in advance!",

FSILGs are frats, sororities, and independent living groups that have student-run houses. Most rent out their rooms over the summer and accept non-MIT boarders. There is no centralized system so you have to contact houses individually to apply. Prices will vary a lot from house to house (and my price quotes are several years out of date anyway). Facilities vary too but I'm pretty sure they all provide a bed and a desk at minimum.",

They were actively working to conceal these donations from the administration. Who else would they be hiding from? Clearly others at the lab knew what was going on.\n\nIf it were revealed bunch of departments were receiving money from JE, maybe there'd be reason to believe this was on Reif's radar. But I haven't see evidence that is the case.\n\nBtw I want to clarify I am no fan of the administration, or either hockfield or Reif. I think they are all awful.",

I may or may not have put off a lot of my HASS requirements including 2 course 14 classes (for concentration), a CI-H, and the rest of HASS electives.\n\nCan anyone help me choose some of the 5 classes? Are there any non time consuming classes? Classes that work well together? I feel a bit overwhelmed trying to choose 5.",

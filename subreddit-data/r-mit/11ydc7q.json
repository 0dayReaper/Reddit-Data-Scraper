    "postText": "Lots of people have been asking on this sub about summer housing options. I highly recommend looking into FSILGs as they are generally the cheapest option.\n\nIn particular, ET offers week to week rent, so it's a great option for people that will only be around part of the summer. Rent is $245/week (with a discount if you're staying the whole summer!). You can get more info by emailing [et-summer-housing@mit.edu](mailto:et-summer-housing@mit.edu).\n\nSome other facts about ET:  \n\\- Very close to two green line T stops  \n\\- Easy walking distance to a Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Target, CVS, and more  \n\\- Free laundry  \n\\- Cool, nerdy people\n\nETA: All students are welcome! Not just MIT students!",

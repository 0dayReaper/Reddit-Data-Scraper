Last year, you had to be online exactly when they put up the first listings and the website crashed because 2,000 people were trying to get on it for 500 listings. Whoever the website didn\u2019t crash for got the housing. \n\nAnyway, I was super lucky to get a spot at The Warehouse since it was the only one with spots left besides the super expensive Site Four (site four I think won\u2019t be available next school year). The Warehouse is only for first year grad students and I like it a lot.",

I\u2019m a fairly introverted person and would prefer to live in an efficiency or 1 bedroom apartment. I understand it\u2019s quite pricey, but comfort is pretty valuable too. I was thinking of the \u201cgraduate tower\u201d efficiency",

The building is wonderful: clean, quiet, and beautiful. A few rooms on every floor have views of the river. The heating/cooling/appliances etc always work, the gym is pretty good, and the other residents are mostly quiet singles and sweet young families. It's about a 7 minute walk to my office on campus, which is a huge plus, but you might want to look at a map and find your department. As Cambridge/Somerville/Boston housing goes, I really, really like it.",

Maybe they fixed some of the issues that happened last year. Maybe this time first years/incoming students get priority\u2026\n\nSorry for confusion, I meant the graduate tower when I said Site Four. You might want to double check if they are indeed open next school year (I thought I got an email saying they aren\u2019t). If they are, it might actually be easier to get a place there because it\u2019s absurdly expensive if you\u2019re living alone so people are much less willing to shell out their money for it.",

Lots of social events that you can choose to attend if you want to meet new people (especially at the beginning of the year) or get free food (always), but you can obviously not go and the building is very silent. I chose to live in a 2-bedroom, so I share kitchen and bathroom, and honestly I\u2019d recommend it: if you are lucky you make a new friend, if not you still don\u2019t have a smelly kitchen in your room and you save a couple hundred bucks per month.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen all other buildings but as far as I know (or as far as I have seen):\n\n- Ashdown is nice too, apparently rooms are slightly smaller but shared spaces are larger; apparently similar vibe to SidPac;\n\n- Warehouse seems nice, but you can only keep it one year; also last year it was very noisy and people were complaining;\n\n- Tang can get you really nice views and is cheaper, but is kind of older and dirtier, and rooms are reeeeally small",

My two flatmates were both really nice persons, but we didn\u2019t really become friends or anything, so I basically just live my own life and my flatmate lives his. We cross paths at most once per day, chat only if we both feel like it, and that\u2019s pretty much it. The chances that both of you need the bathroom or the kitchen at the same time are quite small, and worst case scenario one can wait a couple of minutes. \n\nI\u2019m trying to keep my descriptions as neutral as possible. I had broadly a good experience with 2-bed and would recommend it, but it might not be the best solution for everyone. \n\nSchematically:\n- Pros: cheaper, potentially make a new friend, have the kitchen outside of your living/studying/sleeping space (underrated point), having two doors between bed and corridor;\n- Cons: you might get unlucky and your flatmate is not a good fit (if that happens you can switch rooms after 3/4 weeks if I remember correctly, and even buildings), or you might value highly having a bathroom/kitchen available at any time (they\u2019re available 97-98% of the time statistically)",

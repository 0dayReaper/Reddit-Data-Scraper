    "postText": "I don't know how many of you read this, but my thanks go out to anyone involved in running/organizing events, hosting pre-frosh, leading tours, and generally being awesome on campus these last few days. I found a dorm and a community that felt genuinely magical, realized I need to do some sort of kick-ass performance art in college, and had the time of my life.\n\nWe could tell that you cared. We could tell that you were honest with us, wanted us to have a good time, and loved your community. Don't ever doubt how positively you impact us, because damn am I excited to join y'all in the fall. See you then, and good luck adjusting back to work mode!",

Plus it\u2019s nice to feel respected and like our opinion matters when there are so many prefrosh open to listening to our sage advice :P\n\nREX should be even better because people can focus fully on it. And then you get to help run CPW from this side!",

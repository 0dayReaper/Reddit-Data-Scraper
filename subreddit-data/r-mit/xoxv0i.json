    "postText": "I know that the major requirements are different and that the Focused option appears to be more intensive, but is there a time difference? Work difference? Is it like the difference between AP Physics 1 and AP Physics C (meaning one is relatively easy and doesn't involve a lot of things whereas the other is quite intense and difficult)? Could somebody give a compare/contrast between the two?\n\nThanks in advance",

            "comment": "The only difference is Focused requires specific classes that you don't have to take for Flex. Diploma says the same thing. Work differences are caused by different classes so then it's more of a question of the differences of those classes.",

            "comment": "Most people I know take flex, even if they don\u2019t intend to double major. It gives them the choice between taking one of the requirements of the focused option and a class in another discipline, or even to take more advanced physics courses that would be tough to fit in 8 focused.\n\nI don\u2019t think any of the majors at MIT have significant \u201ctime differences,\u201d unless you come in with a shit ton of transfer credit. Even then, among the people I know, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a strong association between course and workload. I\u2019m curious to hear what others think though",

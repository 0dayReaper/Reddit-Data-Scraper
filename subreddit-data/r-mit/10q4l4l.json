We are alumni and current students and community members, and would only know the requirements for admission from what's publicly available online.\n\nHowever, if you're asking how I think someone would fare if they transferred into MIT after their first year without any college-level Physics, I would tell you that that person would have a very difficult time in front of them, and, with it already being very hard to transfer into MIT, I'd guess that person would be unlikely to get in. If you then showed me that MIT specifically recommends them to take calculus-based Physics, then I'd be even more confident that someone who had zero Physics background would have trouble transferring in.\n\nEspecially because it seems like there's an easy fix for a current college student to learn physics: take physics.",

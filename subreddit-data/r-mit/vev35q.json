    "postText": "The MechE PhD handbooks says: \"an RA may register for no more than 24 units of classroom work\"\n\nI've heard differing statements about this. Some people have told me this is strict and others have told me that you can take more than 24 units (most courses are 12 units each) if your advisor approves of it. Does anyone have experience with taking more than 24 units a semester? Thanks.",

MIT can lay ownership on an awful lot of stuff if it was developed when you had an RA, even if it was developed on your own time. The TLO is the most grabby, shitty organization within MIT.\n\nBest focus on finishing up early and work on company after graduating.",

For me, getting a single was worth every cent: I had more energy to throw into classes, clubs, and maintaining my health.   \nIf you know you're flexible and want to save money, a triple is probably fine. But especially if you don't know who your roommates will be, and you're already worried about having alone time, a double is much more manageable. When I was a freshman, we were able to switch dorms during the first week (REX), so if it's still the same, I'd recommend giving the triple a shot and seeing how you like it!",

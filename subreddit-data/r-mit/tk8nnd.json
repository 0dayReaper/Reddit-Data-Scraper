    "postText": "What graduate housing do you recommend? I am looking for efficiency or something with no roommates. I know this question has been posted here a few times. I have read all the posts in here regarding housing, but I am still a bit undecided about how to rank/what my preferences are.\n\nI am an incoming PhD student, starting Fall 2022. I will only be living on-campus for the first year. I am married but my spouse will not be living with me the first year. However, I am still considering the couples housing that way when he visits me he can stay for long periods of time if he wanted to. I might end up putting a combination of single and couples housing in my ranking (hopefully that is allowed?)...\n\nI am considering the following (ranked in terms of current preference):\n\n1. Westgate\n\n* efficiency for couples $1,641\n* I like that it's not furnished since I can bring in a real bed with me\n   * how comfortable are the beds in the furnished rooms? \n* it also seems to have a regular sized fridge which I think is nice\n\n   2. Warehouse\n\n* efficiency $1,745 \n* this one is not for couples, but I like that the beds they provide are bigger and the rooms look nice \n\n  3. SidPac\n\n* efficiency for couples $1,745\n* can two people reasonably sleep in this small of a bed (XL twin bed)? \n* the efficiency in Ashdown House is the same price as this one but doesn't accommodate couples so I think I might as well put sidpac instead of Ashdown... \n\nEdgerton and the 70 Amherst St. 1-br apartments would be in my list if they weren't expensive, but they are out of my preferred budget range - if these are absolutely worth it, I might consider them\n\nLastly, I am super tempted to suck it up and request a single or large single room in 70 Amherst St. The price is very tempting, $928 for the single and $1,103 for the large single. This would allow me to save and pay down my debt by a LOT. My biggest concern is not having a kitchen in the room. Does anyone have experience using the communal kitchen? How crowded does it get? Can you use it any time/is it open 24/7? Is there an eating area or do students normally eat in their rooms? I barely eat out, so I cook almost all of my meals. I saw a picture of the communal kitchen on their website and it looks alright. Is there enough space in the room to have a mini fridge? Has anyone lived in one of these rooms in Amherst? Is it worth it? Would you recommend it? Again, it would only be for the first year.  \n\nCommunity/events within each building are not extremely important to me, they are a plus but will not affect my ranking. What influences my preferences the most are: price and cleanliness of the building. The location is not super important either, I looked where all the buildings are located and they all seem to be in good spots... \n\nI appreciate any insight and suggestions! Thank you!",

If your family/partner lives elsewhere but only comes to visit for a few weeks or months of the year, you are not eligible for family housing.\"\n\nI believe you would still qualify for the other options you listed.",

Additionally, your spouse technically wouldn't be allowed to go about the building without you escorting them.",

            "comment": "I lived in 70 Amherst my first year in a small single. Communal kitchen can be hit or miss. There are large spacious ones and small cramped ones. Depending on ur room assignment you may be close or far. Each kitchen has cabinets that you can lock your things in, but the fridge is totally open access. The smaller kitchens were often problematic since people would leave a mess. The communal bathrooms were actually kept fairly clean. I kept a mini fridge in my room as well as a microwave. The rooms are small but the proximity to campus is nice if that's important to you. \n\nBy far the worst part is the absolute lack of food, groceries, and entertainment in the Kendal square area. The closest market is brothers and is overpriced. \n\nThe absolute best part (aside from low cost) was being right on the river. The sailing pavilion is right near the dorm so it's very easy to take advantage of it. Also it is next to the campus bar. \n\n70 amherst is a great way to save money but it comes at a great cost: it's a dorm not an apartment. 70 Amherst was an undergraduate dorm and the only change since they made it a graduate dorm is that they've painted over some of the (pornographic) murals. Would I do it the same if I could do it all over again? Yes.\n\nAlso, I've been told by friends who live in singles in other dorms (sidpac) that on campus singles are cheaper than almost anything you will find within a reasonable distance from campus off the red line. But living with roommates off campus is cheaper than with roommates on campus. Personally, I recommend living in Porter square or Davis square, in my four years here I've lived in both. The green line is also being extended into north Somerville which may make commuting from more affordable areas easier. Typically the further from the red line the cheaper.  There is a Harvard/MIT housing page on Facebook you should look into. It can sometimes save you from having to pay brokers fees.",

                    "comment": "Thank you! This is exactly what I wanted to learn about 70 Amherst. Thanks for the insight about the kitchens; it sounds like there are different depending on the floor/side of building? If I do end up in one of the rooms there, I would probably get a mini fridge and microwave as well. \n\nIt does look like the most dorm-like of them all, but that price is hard to beat. I think it wouldn't be too bad for a yr, again, considering I could aggressively pay down some of my debt and continue putting some of my sad grad income to work. \n\nI visited campus last week and did think the location of this building was quite nice. \n\nMost of what I've found for off campus for a studio and close to the red line seems to start around $1,800+ and would probably have to add utilities to that. I've been checking out that FB page and might consider - there's some good deals on there but mostly for living with roomates\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks again",

So you could potentially either borrow a 2nd bed or loan yours out to replace with a queen or something.",

In undergrad when people stayed at their bf/gf\u2019s dorm they\u2019d always cram into a twin bed, but now that I\u2019m older there would be no way! For me I was used to a futon so it was fine. When one of my suite mates moved out they gave me their mattress topper. You could always buy a memory foam topper, if that\u2019s the kind of thing that helps. The dorms all have different amenities/culture a little bit, it seems a shame to avoid one just for the bed, since you could surely  find a way to buy your own and make room",

In my experience with renting they usually ask for first month, last month, background check fees, application fee, etc. and I don't have money for that right now  \n\n\\- Wouldn't have to worry about paying for utilities\n\n\\- I am leaving my car at my current state during the first yr so rather be really close to campus\n\n\\- If I end up requesting a large room in Amherst, I don't think anything off campus will beat that price - particularly because I don't want roommates  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat  being said, I continue to look at off campus options every now and then. If I find something close to the T and with a decent price I might consider, but not sure if there will be options with no roommates, cheaper price, and no move-in fees. \n\nBut then again I've never lived in MA nor on-campus anywhere so open to hearing what people think about this.",

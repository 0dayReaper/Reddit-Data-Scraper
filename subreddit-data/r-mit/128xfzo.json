    "postText": "I am currently a freshman at MIT who wants to go into mechanical engineering. I know this question has been asked before, but I need more insight with my specific interests. Everyone I have asked has told be to just do 2A since it seems easier, but I am afraid of my potential career aspects taking a blow since it isn't as MechE focused as just straight 2 (which is my primary interest). I need other people's thoughts on my situation, especially from those who had a similar predicament but later figured it out. Anyway, here, I think, are some pros and cons to each.\n\n2:\n\nPros: much more rigorous foundation in MechE, required thesis, will take more subjects relevant to my interests, actually ABET-accredited in MechE\n\nCons: must take more tough classes, mental health may take a hit, wayyy less flexible than 2A\n\n2A:\n\nPros: much more flexible, can pursue other course subjects if I get tired of just 2 (like maybe 12, 8, 20, or 1 idk), will likely have better mental health from what I've heard\n\nCons: not ABET-accredited in MechE, less solid foundation in pure MechE, may have harder time with FE exam\n\nAlso, is it generally easier to switch from course 2 to 2A or vice versa? I was thinking to perhaps start out my sophomore year taking classes for just 2 (like 2.001, 2.002, 2.003, 2.004, 2.086, and 2.007). Then I can figure it out by my junior year.\n\nFollowing my gut, I feel like I would rather do just course 2, but many people have advised against me doing it. I just have no idea what I should do.",

I wouldn\u2019t worry about this part so much if you are interested in 2A.\n\nI don\u2019t think I struggled more than other people in 2A did. In fact, it felt like I always had classes with fellow 2A students - the exception being a class that I took to fulfill the thesis requirement without doing a thesis. \n\nAre there any classes you are worried about and are thinking of avoiding by going 2A? \nAre there any classes you\u2019d be interested in taking that straight 2 won\u2019t allow for, but a 2A concentration could?",

One of my friends, who is in 2A, has told me that seniors disappear while taking 2.009.. like you'll never see them around since that class is just so time intensive. Similar thing with 2.006. I also heard bad things about 2.671. What was your experience with these classes?\n\nThe main issue I have with 2A is that I don't know what my concentration should be. I took 6.100A and absolutely hated it, so 2A-6 is completely off the table for me. This is kind of a shame since I did robotics in high school and loved it. I am interested in 12.001, which could be used for 2A-12, but it is not that relevant with my career interests in potentially climate/ocean sustainability, and the other course 12 classes in those areas have scarily low ratings. I also like physics, but I am not extremely confident that I would do well in classes beyond 8.02, and I heard that employers in MechE don't care about physics beyond just mechanics.\n\nEDIT: wrong course number oops",

If that is your big concern, I'd suggest looking into planning your schedule for the rest of that term to be easier classes.\n\n2A should not be a way to avoid classes, it should be a way to stuff in enough other things you know you want to do that you can't fit in all of the mandatory 1 classes.\n\nWhy are people telling you to not do a regular course 2?",

The requirements are hefty but the classes really give you a broad base of skills and knowledge. I was still able to minor in 21H and used the HASS requirement to try fun new classes. I was afraid to commit to 2-6 but I took classes in 6 whenever equivalents applied and I\u2019m really glad! Take a look at the course requirements and alternatives to be aware of your options!",

You\u2019re at MIT the supposed \u201cnumber one mechE school in the world\u201d. You can be damned sure the competition is learning this stuff. Instrumentation, while a bit outdated when I took it, was a good class with actual help on how to write and articulate proper academic work. It\u2019s a must for anyone who wants to do any scientific writing imho and very useful. \n\nI found in 2.006 the people who were whining about it were also the worst students who didn\u2019t show up to class every time, half assed the p-sets and started them close to their due dates, and just showed up to office hours expecting answers. It\u2019s a class that teaches you to think and pushes you to actually try and apply basic fluid/heat transfer models to moderately complex problems.   \n\nTips:\n- show up to class\n- do the reading before class\n- start the p-sets early\n- ask questions about the p-set in class (profs know you\u2019re being a conscientious student if you do this) \n- ask for help if you need it.\n\n2.006 is where you actually learn to do some heat transfer. The trend in the department over the last 10-15 years is that MechE is basically going soft. Graduates just don\u2019t know fundamentals nearly as well as they should because they\u2019re copping out of difficult classes in the name of 2A. I.e they don\u2019t actually have a good grasp on solid mechanics, fluids, manufacturing, design etc. \n\n\nMIT is hard, and it\u2019s supposed to be for a reason, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to suffer. Just put in the effort to stay on top of things, ask for help when you need it, and you\u2019ll be just fine.",

When I went to grad school, I tried so hard to get out of the 2.006 equivalent course because I didn\u2019t think I would survive a third encounter with HT. My grad school professor thought I was weird for always starting with the basic equations and doing the derivations rather than memorizing the shortcuts based on boundary conditions. She probably thought I was trying to show off but it was just what I learned in 2.006. I aced the class! Forgot my notes for the final and still pulled off the highest score thanks to the foundation and revision techniques I learned at MIT. 2.005/2.006 are hard (one of them won biggest screw every year I was here) but they\u2019re not impossible!",

I also was considering 2-6 and dropped it after taking one course 6 class.\n\nI will admit, 2.006 is difficult. It\u2019s probably the one class I REALLY struggled with and barely passed. HOWEVER, and this is something I want to stress, it is not unbeatable. You know it is difficult (somehow I was not warned of this beforehand), so you know to prepare and make sure to not take it with some other tough classes. Check who is teaching it as well - good profs can make all the difference.\n\n2.009 is definitely a time sucker, however, there are also different levels of involvement. Don\u2019t be a program lead (I don\u2019t remember exactly what they called them) and you should still be ok. I took 2.009 with 2.96 and two easier HASS classes, so it was a pretty balanced workload. I will also say that 2.007, 2.008 and 2.009 are experiences that will actually help you in your career, and are classes that actually make you feel like a MechE. They were stressful but also the few classes that I have vivid and fond memories of.\n\n2.671 depends really heavily on your project. Mine was mainly a matter of getting the code down, and then it was fairly smooth sailing. It\u2019s a work intensive class but I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much.\n\nI think course 2 gives you a really solid foundation for your engineering career. Don\u2019t be scared by some classes being difficult - MIT is difficult, but it is nothing you can\u2019t beat. Get help early and stay on top of stuff, and you will get there (:",

I think since I don't have a clear vision of what I should do for a concentration in 2A, I am siding more with just doing course 2, especially since I feel that the more advanced course 2 classes will be more relevant for my career interests. Then, I can take a few other classes outside of my major during IAP or less busy semesters. I can definitely see why people with interests outside of 2 would like to do 2A though.",

I can still take robotics courses too (like 2.12). I think I was initially scared of classes that are notorious for working course 2 people to the bone (like 2.006 and 2.009), which was my primary reason of considering 2A, but I think they're necessary for me to grow as a mechanical engineer. Anyway, I appreciate your feedback!",

You can speedrun the rest of your major requirements in Junior year, when you figure out which words you want on your diploma.\n\nSo browse the degree charts &amp; course listings, figure out which classes are most fun, and take them! MIT is one of the few places where doing this has no negative consequences. You don't have to figure everything out right now!",

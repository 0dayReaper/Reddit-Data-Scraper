I'm also looking to take Discrete Math this spring semester but might have a schedule conflict -- does this mean I can still enroll?\n\nAdditionally, were there any elements of the course that required in-person attendance? Like even if lectures are recorded online, are there still in-person elements of the course, whether that's small-group discussion sections or office hours?\n\nAlso, was the final exam administered in-person or were students able to take it remote?\n\nThank you!!",

Recitation attendance is mandatory and like 10 percent of your grade, but there's an online option if you can't make the in-person options. They have both in-person and remote office hours. The final exam was in-person but maybe if you communicate an extenuating circumstance you can take it remotely.",

    "postText": "I am moving to the Boston area to do my postdoc, and I'm starting to look at apartment listings on the Harvard/MIT housing group, craigslist, etc. I have a question about timing. \n\nFirst, one constraint I have is I definitely don't want to sign a long-term lease without physically seeing the apartment for myself. So my original plan was to find short-term housing (i.e., for the summer, roughly May through August) for now and then, over the summer, while I'm in the area, find long-term housing for the period starting August/September. This felt ok to me because I'm ok with a somewhat non-ideal first couple of months there. \n\nHowever, I am seeing apartment listings for August/September rentals right *now*. This is getting me worried: If I wait until the summer to get there and find long-term housing, would that be too late to find long-term housing starting August/September? \n\nIf so, I could come to that area for a couple of weeks right now-ish and AirBnB while I find a place to sign a lease for starting late summer. Is that the only option here? Or, am I jumping the gun in concluding that there won't be August/September listings in June? Should I just wait until then? \n\nI don't want to leave this long-term housing to chance and so want to make sure I'm in Boston when the maximum number of August/September listings open up. \n\nThanks for any advice!",

            "comment": "Rates are going up in September again, so even if you signed now for a place most are only leasing until September - EVERYONE moves Sept 1 (for the most part, not really).  Most places want leases signed 2-3 months ahead of time, so May/June is when you'll see a lot more on the market.  Some owners are waiting until the May/June time to sign to see how high they can go.  So really, if you do find a place now beginning in Sept it might be cheaper than in May/June (at least per some of the real estate chatter I'm hearing).  However, they still might try and jump the rent - that happened when I moved here.  Did rent sight unseen, then the guy tried to get more rent out of me and he didn't sign the lease even though I (working through a broker) did.  So a couple weeks before I'm set to move I'm looking again.",

How'd that be legal? (Wouldn't the lease  be my legal document protecting me from something like that?)\n\nThanks a lot for your response, I really appreciate the insight!\n\nEDIT- I just read your last line. I'm really sorry about that! That sounds so shady!",

So then he changed his mind and tried to get more money.  So no, they legally can't up the rent once everything is fully executed and you are about to move in.",

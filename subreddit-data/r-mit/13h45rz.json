    "postText": "Searching up MIT waitlist on Reddit and scrolling through all the posts and clicking on the profiles... all of them were accepted to JHU, UPenn, Duke, Harvard, Princeton, Caltech...\n\nMeanwhile after gaining false hope from my MIT waitlist, I got hard rejected by every single T20 INCLUDING Berkeley/LA in-state (ouch).\n\nJust don't know what to do anymore. I feel so lost. Were my essays that bad? Was my personality that undesirable? I had a 1570/3.95 so it couldn't have been my stats. Surely getting waitlisted by MIT means I'm T10 worthy??\n\nI'm not smart. I'm not naturally gifted. I wasn't born with a 200 IQ. Despite that, MIT has been my dream university since I knew what a university WAS. I knew I had to work harder than all those geniuses that get into MIT without trying, so I worked my absolute ass off to the BONE for SIX YEARS; I spent months revising and polishing my MIT essays, neglecting my other EAs and RDs; I fucking slept with my too-small MIT t-shirt under my pillow for MONTHS. I liked to think I had an actual passion for biotechnology and computer science, and I do to some extent, but if I'm being honest, my passion for my work was maybe 10% of the reason why I participated in my ECs; 90% of my drive came from my dream of receiving that MIT letter.\n\nPeople don't look at me the same anymore. For the past four years, everyone just assumed I was going to a top university. And all the self-doubt, the imposter syndrome, the fear of disappointing everyone around me, got to my head. I was so, so desperate for that MIT admission.  It would have proved ONCE and for ALL, to everyone but especially ME, that I WASN'T dumb, I WAS capable. It would have stopped my self-hatred in its tracks. Just reading those nine words--\"Congratulations! You were admitted to MIT's class of 2027\"--would negate all the blood, sweat and tears, all the sleepless and tear-filled nights, all the therapy sessions and anti-depressants, all the mental breakdowns backstage before concerts, all the rage-fueled outbursts and burnt bridges, all the cutting and miserable self-harm, all the toxic breakups in the name of academics--all of it would be vindicated, all of it would be worth it.\n\nInstead... \"while we are unable to offer you admission at this time, we have placed you on our wait list.\" And after that, rejections everywhere. From colleges I considered backups. From colleges I considered targets. From every single reach school. And after THAT, looks and stares. \u201cI guess he wasn\u2019t as smart as we thought.\u201d The side-eyes. \u201cYou got into a SOLID school.\u201d The whispering. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even get into a T20!\u201d The outright insults. \"Stop coping and admit you weren't talented enough for a top 10.\" Enduring all the commitment posts from all my friends getting into Princeton, Harvard, Caltech, MIT. Reaching out and telling me they were sorry I didn\u2019t get in anywhere, that I really deserved it. Not that that mattered. The disappointed lecture from my father: \u201cwe thought you were good enough to get into Stanford or MIT.\u201d And \u201cI can\u2019t believe you got rejected from Berkeley in-state!\u201d The pitiful glances from my mother. Worst of all, the confused stares of my relatives, my own GRANDMOTHER, who didn\u2019t even know the name of the school I committed to. All the pain, all the toil, all the years of misery dreaming of a day where I could finally look back on my years of high school and say, \u201cyes. That was worth it. I stuck through the pain and got my reward.\u201d None of that ever came. And the MIT WL decision, if negative, will be the final nail in the coffin of that dream.\n\nI'm sorry, but if I don't get into MIT tomorrow, I might actually snap.",

Is this some kind of humble brag that you got into two T10 engineering programs that most people would do anything to get into? \n\nIt honestly baffles me why people do this. All this is going to do is make other people feel worse for not getting into the schools you apparently consider unimpressive.",

You got into two great engineering programs, you\u2019ll be perfectly fine. But having a chip on your shoulder because you didn\u2019t get into the schools you wanted won\u2019t serve you well.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t even really matter where you do your undergrad. I did mine at a lower-ranked engineering school than CMU, and now I\u2019m starting my PhD at MIT in the fall. And on MIT\u2019s visit weekend for my program, a very large portion of admitted students were from state schools. It really only matters what you do in undergrad, not where you do it.",

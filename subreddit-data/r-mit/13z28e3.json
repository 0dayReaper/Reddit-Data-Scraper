(Been visiting every Tuesday/Thursday and it seems there are no available units now)\n\nWas wondering if anyone knew any good places to search around for housing off-campus. I'm coming from abroad, so am unsure where to be on the look-out for units.\n\nOr is there still a apossibility that dorm units may open up throughout the months...? \ud83e\udd72",

It's a cutthroat process to be honest and I wish you the best of luck. I got my on campus housing the last week of July so there is hope yet. As for off campus housing, I would say maybe try some Facebook groups that are either MIT, Harvard, or Boston specific. Those might be your best bet as an international student if you don't get on campus housing. Good luck!",

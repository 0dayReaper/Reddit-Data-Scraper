I\u2019m not too close to my school during the summer, gonna be back around August 15th tho and will have a car to commute to anywhere. I\u2019m looking to get involved with some type of community service project, something that is more than just a 4 hour work day at a big organization. I want to have something on my resume that shows something unique and also that shows commitment. I\u2019m pretty into disk golfing so initially I really wanted to get involved with building a new course and put 4-8 hours into it every week for a few months or whatever it would take, that\u2019s a great example of the type of thing I\u2019m looking for, but they just finished a brand new one last may so I don\u2019t know if there would be another project like that this coming fall. Just wondering if anyone has some ideas of what I could do or if you are working on something yourself or have connection with anyone that could help me get involved somewhere. Again I just want to find something that\u2019s a legit commitment and better than going to a few different cliche organizations which won\u2019t really stand out on an application.",

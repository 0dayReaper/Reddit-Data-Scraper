    "postText": "Prefrosh trying to do a little preparation for the 18.01 ASE. I took 2 years of calculus in highschool sophomore and junior year, and just want to brush up. Looking at OCW to get an idea of what will be on the test. Things are going well, I was just a little concerned because I saw that a lot of the material, syllabus, exams is from 2006. Does 18.01 still match up with this today? [Here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/pages/syllabus/)\u2019s the link to the syllabus/course.",

All Topsy turvy now.\n\nFor what it's worth, the math ASEs were the easiest of them all because the material in 18.01/2/3 are going to be very familiar to any AP or IB class you took. Compared to chem or bio, which was almost nothing like high school chem or bio.",

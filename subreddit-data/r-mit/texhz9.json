    "postText": "Hi! \n\nI am a frosh incoming this fall admitted through early action this year. I currently have 2 questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. For those that have taken ASEs for the General Requirements (such as Chem Bio and 18.01), was AP courses enough for yall to take them and pass for credit? What would you recommend to prepare them if you have never taken an AP course in them? (I say this because I think 18.01 covers basically AP Calc BC).\n2. How many courses do you all suggest to take to maintain a healthy mental health while getting all out of the MIT experience? I'm looking to double major and I don't knock out my general requirements until sophomore spring based on my roadmap. I'm thinking to perhaps take more courses but I'm afraid it will tank on my mental health and other social activities. What are you guys' advice on that?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "My general advice is to not double major.  With maybe a few exceptions, double majoring can be really limiting, and I'm not sure if the benefits are really worth it.  And it's not as if you either double major in a subject or take no courses.  You can do things like, take a lot of the courses required for the major but just not all.  But I think especially at a place like MIT where there are a lot of cool and interesting classes to take, it's nice to have the ability to be flexible.",

Even then it was pretty much all \"technical major + something HASS\", not two technical\u2014because that's usually a waste of time. Pick a primary major and just minor/do a concentration/take random classes in the other thing. Employers and B-school admissions officers won't care.",

Don't exceed that until you get used to MIT, and then only if you really need to.\n\nDon't double major unless there's a very specific thing you want to do that genuinely requires those academic credentials. Otherwise it's a ton more work and all you get is some extra words on a piece of paper. The piece of paper and where it's from matters, what exactly it says doesn't.\n\nIf you don't double major, there's plenty of time to complete a major with 4 or even fewer classes per term. And then MIT can be a fun and only occasionally soul-crushing place, as opposed to destroying you continuously for four (or more) years.",

            "comment": "1. Depends on how in depth your AP class was, and how standard your ASE is. For instance, when I took the bio ASE, they had a lot of gene transfer questions, and I didn't know how to do those, whereas the sample ASE I took seemed more in line with my AP knowledge. People (at least a few years ago) used to talk about how the chem ASE was so so difficult, even though the majority of the questions were within the breadth of AP content, and I think a lot of it was because that ASE always covered crystal field theory, which isn't a topic taught in AP. \n2. Well, that's up for you to find out. The first semester is PNR, and that will allow you to figure out how many classes you can take without sacrificing other aspects of your life. People say four is standard, but the specific classes you choose really affect how that goes. I've taken between 3.5 and 7, and they sucked in different ways. Also, you don't have to take all your GIRs in freshman fall. You can take a few GIRs but also try out some intro major requirements to get a taste of if that's what you want to do.",

I got a 49% on the 5.12 ASE and passed (which leads me to conjecture that 41% was a pass, since that's the C cutoff for the class), but I'm pretty sure that I had to get 70+ to get a B on the 8.02 ASE which I took over junior year IAP. Other ASEs either don't tell you your score or letter grade, or only give you a letter grade. (To clarify, if you take the ASE during orientation, the letter grade wouldn't show up on your transcript, but it would just be on your results page or something.)",

I ASE\u2019d 6.0001 and 18.01 (had transfer credit for 18.02 and 18.06). \n\nfor 18.01, I pretty much forgot most of BC calc because I took it my sophomore year of high school. I went through all of Khan Academy\u2019s course on it and that was more than enough for me.\n\nfor 6.0001 (not sure if you care), I took AP CSA in my sophomore year as well and I did some codeacademy / codingbats to teach myself python. I definitely barely passed that ASE by the skin of my teeth but it wasn\u2019t terrible.\n\nfor bio and chem, look at old finals/practice exams/ASEs if you can. they\u2019re not too similar to AP classes, whereas 18.01 and 8.01 definitely are. \n\nas for courses, I\u2019m only on my second semester, but 4 is definitely enough. look into your double major and see if you 1) really need to (doing a major and minor will probably get you what you\u2019re looking for!) and 2) if it actually requires you to take more than 4 (maybe 5 sometimes) classes. regardless I think there\u2019s like an 80% chance that by the time you get here, your decision on your major is going to change, and it\u2019s going to keep changing while you\u2019re here. don\u2019t stress \u2014 no matter what, you\u2019re going to get out of here with a degree from MIT and an incredible education and most of all, an incredible experience. that is, if you make sure you make the most of it rather than taking unnecessary classes and overworking yourself. \n\nfeel free to pm me if you have anymore questions!",

            "comment": "Current '25 student here, can give some advice about ASEs. I took the ASE for the 6 courses below, and failed chem. OCW = OpenCourseWare\n\n**18.01**  \\- I would say that AP Calculus BC is enough to pass this ASE, and maybe you could look at the OCW as well to get a refresher as to what topics/problems will be on the exam.\n\n**18.02** \\- mainly used the OCW to prepare for this course, I would say that the OCW problems are a good representation of the exam.\n\n**8.02** \\- I would say the OCW is pretty decent, although nowhere near the difficulty of the actual exam. The 8.02 course on edX is pretty good, and  I'm pretty sure they're lenient with the grading for this one. If you've taken AP Physics C: E&amp;M, most of the exam content is covered in the AP course, but you might want to look at some stuff about waves.\n\n**5.111** \\- dear god i bombed this test i think only studying the 5.111 OCW isn't enough, would recommend looking at the 5.112 OCW maybe if you want to pass it. AP chem is not enough\n\n**7.012** \\- I prepared for this using the edX course with Eric Lander (he's a really good teacher). I think that the OCW is not that good (video quality is pretty bad) and if you really want to study using OCW, maybe try looking at 7.016 OCW. I also looked at Campbell a bit. I didn't take AP Bio in high school, but I heard from others that the content of this ASE is pretty different from what AP Bio covers.\n\n**6.0001** \\- this ASE wasn't too bad, but I did some coding in high school in AP CSA. It's definitely possible to teach yourself Python in the few weeks before. Also, I think the 6.0001 people give practice problems on MITx. Idk really what I did to prepare for this, but i just went through the videos on MITx (or edX, i forgot) did some practice problems and that was it",

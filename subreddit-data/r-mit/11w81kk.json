This means that **rising sophomores are not guaranteed singles**. We are stressing this point now so that rising sophomores have time to find roommates in the likely event we do not have enough singles. In order to better diagnose the single shortage, all rising sophomores will complete a mandatory, non-binding form indicating their rooming intentions (single/double/triple)... After we have a reasonable response rate, we will email everyone who intends to select a single their chances of being able to do so.\n\nWould encourage you to email the housing chairs if you have more questions!",

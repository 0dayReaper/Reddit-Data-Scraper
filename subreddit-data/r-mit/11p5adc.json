    "postText": "I received a number of emails, from my department, DSL and the grad student union, about \"flyers posted around the campus expressing hateful anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs.\" Then, on Thursday, [an op-ed was published in The Tech discussing recent posters protesting MIT's free speech policy](https://www.thetech.com/2023/03/10/posters-miss-the-point). However, no where has anyone described what these posters actually said so that we can decide for ourselves on the severity of this issue and the appropriate response. It is not even clear to me from the Tech article and the emails if they are referring to the same posters or what the general stance of the posters was. Were they pro-free speech and anti-LGBTQ or were they satirical and protesting the free speech policy? What did the posters actually say?",

They were supposed to be satirical in protest of the new free speech statement that says MIT can\u2019t \u201cprohibit offensive language,\u201d but ended up just contributing to the problem they were trying to call attention to.  A lot of people saw MIT\u2019s response to the situation as lukewarm and that caused further controversy.\n\n[Also optically this just looks horrible and I don\u2019t see how they thought it was a good idea - there are all sorts of right wing outlets running with it being a \u201cfalse flag\u201d]",

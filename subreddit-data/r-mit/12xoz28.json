    "postText": "I am an incoming PhD student, and I was looking for opinions on life at 70 Amherst. From what I understand, the conversion from an undergraduate to graduate dorm was relatively controversial and so most of the opinions I\u2019ve seen online are quite negative. \n\nPutting aside the controversial decision to renovate the building, what is life like at 70 Amherst? Does the dorm-style layout foster a better or worse social environment compared to Ashdown or Sidpac? I am predominantly interested in living somewhere with a good sense of community where I can meet other fellow graduate students outside or just my cohort.",

            "comment": "I don't know about 70 Amherst, but just chiming in to let you know that Ashdown has many community events going on. There's weekly coffee hours, monthly brunch, and Fun Fund events (you get funding from Ashdown to organize a fun event like puzzle night or a trip to the ice cream place.) I haven't tried volunteering, but my impression is that there are also many volunteering opportunities (help hosting brunch, be an officer, etc) where you can socialize with other residents. I'm pretty sure other grad dorms have some version of community events as well. Also, events in one dorm are often advertised to other dorms -- I often get emails inviting Ashdown residents to events at SidPad/Tang/Warehouse etc., and of course residents in other dorms (and any grad student, really) are welcome to Ashdown events.",

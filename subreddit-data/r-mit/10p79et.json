    "postText": "Hello, I have been invited for an informal interview (tomorrow) for the MEng MechE program , what should I expect ? The mail says it will be 20 mins long and I do not need to prepare anything additional. I would like to know if anyone has previously done this interview and what type of questions were asked. It will go a long way in helping me ace the interview.",

Just be prepared to talk about your interest in the program, your background and passions, and maybe have something you like about MIT. These are things you should have floating on the top of your head anyway, though",

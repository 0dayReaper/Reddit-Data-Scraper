    "postText": "Over the summer, there was discussion over the continued closing of campus to non-MIT affiliates. Except for the faceless administrators who made this decision, every opinion I've heard has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\nBut what happens now? People are busy with the fall semester and are going about their lives. Is this just going to become the new normal, and in a year or two there will be enough new students who didn't even know about the open campus? \n\nIs there any student or faculty activism to keep pushing back? What do the UA and GSC have to say about it?",

I sincerely doubt that administrators even give a shit about those with long covid, but for now this feels beneficial for a staggered opening policy where we\u2019re not just going to fling the doors open and expose the community even more.\n\nit feels wrong to have the hacker community (I know, I used to be in it) being so ableist (arguably it\u2019s always been) and fighting for a policy which would endanger more students with little reward (the clubs and students that used to use the open access policy have moved on, it\u2019s just tourists now) when so much of campus is sick rn from just orientation events. \n\nlet\u2019s work up to better using TIM tickets and maybe proposing temporary access cards for positive presences or having one of the many cited reasons in the petition to be here. if we\u2019re so passionate, we can better acknowledge this relationship with the community and sponsor access. there\u2019s better ways to repair a community relationship that just pretending like nothing\u2019s changed. \n\n(also, ur literally never going to get through to the \u201cfaceless admin\u201d with grand demands. you need to start with small asks and concession and keep it going. open campus immediately broached is scary when it\u2019s in direct opposition to a stated decision. literally when has a decision been overturned outright. even the banana lounge is needing to make small concessions and trial periods to work back to 24 hour access.)",

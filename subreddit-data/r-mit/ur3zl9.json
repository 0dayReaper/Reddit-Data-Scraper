    "postText": "Can PhD students take any of the Sloan courses offered? What opportunities are available to Sloan students that are not available to PhD students? How can a PhD student best make use of the entrepreneurial opportunities on campus? Does MIT have an alumni network working in banking or VC that can help with funding? Feel free to answer only some of all of the questions, thanks for your help!",

            "comment": "My experience is from a few years ago - so take it with a grain of salt. There are probably some core courses (Financial Statement Analysis, Finance, Org. Behavior) that may be harder to get into as a PhD student.  But you should be able to find your way into most of the electives. I think you'll be a hot commodity as a TA for any course you do take.\n\nHowever, the summer internship recruiting may be a little more focused on the Sloan population. Those are generally aimed at recruiting the graduates a year later so they may not be as interested in PhDs. No shortage of other opportunities I think.",

My buddy above got a job in Wall Street before he left MIT.",

            "comment": "Definitely yes, you can take courses from Sloan, but with the bidding it might be harder because the priority is always given for MBAs and the other degree students at Sloan. Also The Engine (VC) at MIT, has openings for associates that have PhD but also want to get into VC. Because of the focus on investing in tough tech.",

Do you already have an idea and want to raise funds for it?\n\nClasses are typically open to anyone, but you may have to go through Sloan bidding process.\n\niHQ, Martin Trust Center, VMS are all open to all MIT students and will have experience with funding.",

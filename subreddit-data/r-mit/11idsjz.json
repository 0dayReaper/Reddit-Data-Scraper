    "postText": "Hi all, I'm interested in the Sloan Sustainability certificate but wanted more info on it. Is it only for students pursuing a graduate degree or can you earn just the certificate? Also, is this certificate different from MIT Professional Education Sustainability certificate? What's needed to get accepted into MIT to earn a graduate certificate? If anyone would be able to help answer some of these questions, that would be great! :)",

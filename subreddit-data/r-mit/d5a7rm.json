The 70-something head of a nationally known lab gets on a private jet with a convicted billionaire pedophile to vistit his island populated by hot teenage hangers-on, one of whom mysteriously propositions him. At what point does it become clear to the reasonable person that coercion and child sex trafficking may be at play? I'm having a hard time reaching a conclusion that these actions are anything but reprehensible.\n\nThe solution is quite easy. When a convicted billionaire pedophile offers you a bribe to help him reintegrate into society - you say \"No thanks, you damn dirty pedophile, stay the fuck away from me and the institution I represent\". How hard was that?",

Giuffre is 31 now (2019), and she was 17 in the allegations she made about Minsky, so it happened in 2005.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, in March 2005 was when a woman contacted Palm Beach PD to allege that her stepdaughter was abused by Epstein. At that point, the police and FBI launched a 13-month undercover investigation. It would have been 2006 by the time the investigation was concluded.\n\nIt's very likely that Minsky wouldn't have known any of the things we know today about Epstein.",

You have a corrupt judicial system whose main role is driven by economic and political again, not justice as it is generally understood.\n\nSome of my opinions on this issue are here - https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/d5b26c/richard_stallman_resigns_as_free_software/f0lpojr/\n\nI just don't buy into your society's moral hypocrisy. If Jeffrey Epstein's pedophilia was considered by the society he lived in to be such a terrible thing then why was he given the freedom to ran around and invite more people to his parties? Why don't you blame the whole political and judicial establishment for giving the convicted pedophile the free run of his society instead of incarcerating him properly back then?\n\nFor my money I would consider Monica Lewinsky as much as victim of grooming and abuse by authority figures just as much as Virginia Giuffre, even though she was well into the age of consent. The issue here is not really their physical age or maturity, it is the exploitation of the naivety by authority figures who dazzle them. Calling that rape because of legal definitions is a bit of a stretch for me.\n\nIf she was locked in a room like those girls from Third world countries and Eastern Europe who are trafficked and locked in brothels by brutal violent pimps, I would have a great deal more sympathy and outrage over it.\n\nYour society glorifies sex to teen boppers from a very young age. Beyonce, Adriana Grande, Brittany Spears, Rihanna and all these feted celebrities play a role in sexualizing girls from a young age, and you all turn out surprised that some of these girls get groomed into having sex for fanciful clothes, credit cards, international travel to exotic foreign destinations before the age of 17.\n\nIf she was 13,14 or less I would feel more sympathetic towards her and other girls like her, but 16/17 no way. Your legal system has no problem with trying juveniles as adults when it suits them, why then is a 17 year old with all the privileges and opportunities her affluent Western society offers her be considered a victim of rape, because she was seduced by wealth and glamour by others who profited from it?\n\nSomeone would say she got tricked into that state as a consequence of being raised in a family environment by a family who didn't install proper moral values in her, unless she got involved out of poverty, but then some would say poverty is relative.\n\nI don't know the exact details of the case and I don't want to be overly judgemental, but your country needs to get its moral act together.\n\nTry convincing some of the people here that because she was a 17 year old influenced by the rich and the powerful and she didn't know what she was doing and she did not consent.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVzgVeuyytA",

This really isn't about 17 or 14 or 13 or 11. It's about taking a stand against people who put children in danger because they have some sort of emptiness in their soul.",

An 18 year old female, who could be only a few months older and even look younger than Virginia then could be in the same psychic circumstances.\n\nIf she or any other young adult were to make the same allegation on the grounds that she was a day older than the age of consent when she had sex with an adult would the judicial system consider her case to  be of any merit? What is the fundamental psychic difference between a person a week younger than the age of consent and a week older than the age of consent? Why express moral outrage over it being *sexual assault* a day before and not *sexual assault* a day after other using a legal definition in a vindictive manner?\n\nA person who feels wronged **at that age** ought to seek redress through civil means if the community concurs, not through the criminal justice system.\n\nStallman made it clear that he did not subscribe to the notion of statutory *sexual assault* which appears to be what is being alluded to in this circumstance, and whether you like it or not, so do a lot of other people, even if they are not ready to express their views on email or on reddit for that matter. \n\nI don't agree with all of Stallman's views about sex with under-age children and I think he is flat out wrong in some of his views, but he is totally spot on in maintaining that reading the common notion of *sexual assault* as is traditionally understood in respect of this claim is unwarranted or premature at the very least.\n\nIf a 17 year old wittingly sells cocaine to a buyer does the judicial system consider the buyer a child abuser and let 17 year old of the hook because they are underage?\n\nIt is unfortunate that young peopled get involved in such circumstances, but such is life.",

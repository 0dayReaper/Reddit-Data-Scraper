    "postText": "Hey y'all, incoming EECS grad student here. I wanted to ask about mental health culture/resources on campus, as I've been recently diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I'm pretty worried about finding support in the Boston area, and was wondering about graduate experiences in accessing mental health resources at MIT or in Cambridge. How hard is it to find help near MIT, and how flexible are programs/advisors with respect to mental health resources? I know it's pretty hard to find advisors who are willing to accommodate mental health issues, but it'd be nice to know how MIT as an institution deals with things like this.",

There are independent resources that are not connected to your direct employer that are free of charge and readily available [here](https://medical.mit.edu/services/mental-health-counseling)",

That's easier if you get prescriptions through CVS or walgreens.",

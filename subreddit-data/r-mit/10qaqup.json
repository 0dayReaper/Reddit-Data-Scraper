    "postText": "What\u2019s are the key differences ( other than the big MIT brand) between supply chain program at MIT and other scale institutions such as Zaragoza ? I am interested in pursuing supply chain master as an alternative to MBA . The scale programs are slightly cheaper than MIT supply chain program. Would like to understand if the other institutes are worth it in terms of ROI, rigor and academic excellence .  Anyone who studied or in the present batch, could you please share your observations from visiting cohorts, inputs from professors etc.? Thanks in advance!",

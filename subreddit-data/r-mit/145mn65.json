    "postText": "Hi! I'm a student on my gap year working in Boston and I was wondering if it was possible for me to take a hardware class at MIT. I was planning on taking it regardless at BU but it would be cool to maybe take it here because the class seems to cover more stuff.   \n\n\nI know Stanford has SCPD, where you can take classes at the school over the summer and even classes with other students during the year. I'm unsure if MIT has an equivalent. \n\nThanks! ",

I wouldn't recommend it unless someone else is footing the bill, like an employer.",

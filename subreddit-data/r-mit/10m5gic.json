I averaged probably 2 hours a week outside of lecture on the class. The professor spends 20-30 minutes a week doing Kahoots too lol\n\nIt\u2019s a CI-HW but I honestly think it\u2019s easier than almost any class I\u2019ve ever taken",

It was also pretty interesting and the readings varied from terrible to amazing. (I liked some of the readings so much I went out and read the entirety of the book they came from. Other readings were infuriatingly poorly justified) In any case though it was a cool class that led to interesting debate and made me think about ethical and other aspects of technology I hadn\u2019t thought much about at all, plus the only work was weekly readings plus 2 assignments throughout the whole semester. Definitely think it was the best HASS-S I could have taken\n\nMy favorite HASS classes tended to be in the languages or literature departments, but I did enjoy technology and society",

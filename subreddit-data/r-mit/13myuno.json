    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nDoes anyone know where to play pickleball on campus? The only place I know near campus is the Kendall roof garden. Can one play pickleball on the third floor of Z center? (Are there tennis nets?)\n\nBtw, I know there are many table tennis tables on campus, but are there any in the Z center also? The ones in SidPac and Stata are to small (I mean the space).\n\nHave a nice weekend!",

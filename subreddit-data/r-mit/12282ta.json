I know it seems daunting at first, but you should just start small and work up to what you like eating. \n\nIf you like technical write ups, consider [Kenji's The Food Lab](https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087) cookbook.",

Then trying again if it fails. \n\nThe first club that comes to mind is MINCE, which are students that commit several hours a week to preparing and cooking food every week for dining pop up events. http://www.mitmince.com/\n\nThen, in my person experience, I gain more cooking experience by living in a cook-for-yourself dorm and cooking for myself. \nAlso, I am in a living community that does rotating cook teams where 5-6 people spend 3 hours on a given evening every week cooking and cleaning up after for everyone else (20-25 people) in the house. I personally like it a lot because I get to spend regular time with people, so I get to know them, and it's much cheaper than the meal plan $16/meal vs $3-5/meal (yay division of labor). My community lets people design their own menus, so sometimes you have people bringing in cultural foods or something they just wanted to eat. This past week I learned how to make tofu chorizo tacos with mole and sopa de fideo. As a result, I eat food from different cultures basically every night. Along the way, you pick up little tips and tricks from different people who grew up learning how to cook differently than you did, and help mentor others who might've never cooked before. The main issue is that this 3 hours on the same day every week is a bit of a commitment, so sometimes people have to swap days because life happens.",

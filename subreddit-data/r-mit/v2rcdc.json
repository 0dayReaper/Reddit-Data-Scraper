    "postText": "Hello. I am not an MIT student but a co-op student at MIT Lincoln lab moving to Boston this summer. I am looking to get active and use the gym and preferably do some group fitness classes each week depending on cost. \n\nMy question is if anyone knows if MIT affiliates can use the gym for free or if they need a membership? Same thing for the group classes. I am supposed to get some kind of MIT affiliate documentation when I start work but I\u2019m not sure if that covers use of the gym or any other MIT facilities while I\u2019m in town. \n\nIf anyone has any info regarding gym/MIT facility use I would love to know!",

            "comment": "You need to pay for a membership as an MIT affiliate. Info on this page: https://www.mitrecsports.com/join/memberships/ for longer-term memberships. Not sure if you can get a summer pass or something, but it's probably not the cheapest option around. Group fitness classes require paying for an extra pass too.",

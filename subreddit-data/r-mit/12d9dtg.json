(the only dlc I know is downloadable content lol)\n\nI guess getting into MIT is difficult but getting 'in' to MIT is also very difficult.",

I got an email from them saying that I needed to contact DLC supervisor first.\n\nBut now I am getting conflicting information as I got my atlas app all setup and active. This should grant me access to their buildings/libraries/etc. \n\nI'll know next week when I get there I guess.",

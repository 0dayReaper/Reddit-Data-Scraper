When you arrive you can still try to switch if you decide you don\u2019t like it during orientation \n\n\nNew vassar and baker r known to have high student athlete populations and since you\u2019ve included that in your post maybe you\u2019d like it in these dorms",

Its most likely the case that some of the dorms like Maseeh (and baker-pls correct me if wrong) will be forced to expand capacity by creating triples or quads out of respective doubles and triples. So, I would try to also look at the dorms that have a lower number of high capacity rooms in order to minimize the chance you get stuck in a scenario like that since it\u2019s hard if you have something like morning practice and are dealing with roommates that go to sleep at 3 am.",

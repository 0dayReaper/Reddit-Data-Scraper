I think it would be a better experience with no parents as you would be more likely to get a real view of the school.",

Even if they could come, I wouldn't recommend them coming.\n\nSource: https://admitted.mit.edu/experience/families\n\n&gt; However, due to MIT's strict Covid-19 safety protocols, Campus Preview Weekend will be for students only this year.\n\n&gt; We know this is disappointing, but we are planning a series of virtual programs for parents and families that will answer your questions and give you a good sense of what MIT is like. Think of it as your own virtual CPW.",

There's an airport shuttle with students at Logan to help you find it, and once you get to campus you'll have a current student to stay with, so it's definitely not necessary for your family to be there. You may also find the current [CPW faq](https://admitted.mit.edu/experience/faq) helpful.",

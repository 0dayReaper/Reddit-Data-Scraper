This includes speaking out against hiring \u201cdiversity consultants\u201d and proposing alternative ideas. It\u2019s quite nasty if you get someone to open up to you to talk about it. Another is with pushing students to be accountable to their responsibilities, but then students retaliate all in the name of \u201cmental health\u201d. \n\nSo here\u2019s an example of admin bloat - RLADs were installed when I was at MIT. Undergrad dorms have one per I think. Dorms already have GRTs and House Masters, so why have a paid \u201cprofessional\u201d who\u2019s essentially a friend of undergrads? All ours did was bake us cookies, talk with us, and attend meetings. Nice healthy 150k/RLAD hire so that MIT can claim \u201cwe\u2019re helping our undergrads!\u201d. It\u2019s literally money pissed away, that adds another voice in the room that is frankly not needed.",

Yesterday just talked to my friend who is studying dual degree both at Sloan and MIT as an engineering student. He also talked a lot about admin issues and international incoming students not getting support, such as their visas were not being issued in due course and there is NO supposed timeline for them to plan to come to the country. \n\nThe first time I was deeply in awe with their poor management was when I emailed a professor at MIT Sloan for quoting his comment on my startup business plan. He replied to say \u201c.. I\u2019m afraid such endorsement has to be certified *by the school*, if the director is fine then I should be fine with it\u201d\n\nIt was just ONE-SENTENCE comment as in \u201cthis looks promising and you are bright!\u201d in his email reply to my business plan. I was trying to show the comment to the plan only. He needed me to check with the Director because he wasn\u2019t sure if \n- he has individual speech right. \n\n\u2026 I can publish whatever I want in regard to whatever academic paper or other people\u2019s startup stuff I read whenever I want free from all the global reputable orgs I associate with. Why MIT Sloan induce *such a fear*? \n\n\nOn a more important note, my assistant sent an email with subject \u201cremove\u201d to rectify their data use in Sloan\u2019s site but they apparently did not give a shit respect to the SWISS LAW. \nThey outrightly ignored her email even if the bounce reply said they would get back within 2 business days. They never got back and continued the aggressive marketing - wow, really hard working. \n\nThe policy was here https://exec.mit.edu/s/policies/privacy-policy\nWow. Do they really respect \n*Any Law* ? \n\nReally interesting organization!",

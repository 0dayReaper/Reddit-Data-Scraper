    "postText": "MIT OpenCourseWare has been tremendously helpful for self-learners like us who had no idea that certain topics existed. OCW made us aware of that and has been of great help to our education. Specially 18.01, 18.02, 18.03, 18.06. I learnt that mathematics can be so beautifully taught from these courses. \n\nI am always looking for things to learn. Any topic, any department as long as it tickles my curiosity bug. \n\nWhat courses are currently being recorded for OCW that are yet to come out? I have asked OCW previously but they don't reply. So I am asking here in the hope that people who sat through those classes can share the info with us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease don't delete this post.",

I was in a class that got filmed once and I dont think it was published for months or maybe even a year later. They have to edit, write accurate captions, prepare complementary materials, etc before the course is ready to go online.",

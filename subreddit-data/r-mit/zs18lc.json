    "postText": "I\u2019m a first year and just took 8.01. In order to pass the course, I have to pass both the class and the exam portion of the class. The grade cutoffs for the class and exam respectively are 65 and 55, respectively (I\u2019ve attached the cut-off for the class) According to my calculations, my final class grade was a 64.6 and my weighted exam average was a 67 (both horrible, I know\u2026 needless to say it\u2019s been a hard semester). The grade on my transcript says DN, but I was above the pass cut-offs. Does the 64.6 get rounded up to 65?",

And I did master the material eventually (I even did 8.03), but I could have saved myself about a half semester of minor pain. If I could, I would definitely go back in time and tell a younger version of myself to really master 8.01. Like take 8.012 (that Physics for Masochists version).",

I\u2019ve got a lot of friends who didn\u2019t do too hot in 8.01 but are pretty amazing at their respective focuses. \n\nJust be prepared for 8.02 to be just as difficult and similarly taught \u2014 meaning that you\u2019re going to have to approach it with a different strategy than you did 8.01. Consider doing things you didn\u2019t do before, like getting tutoring from TSR or whatever it\u2019s called. Or office hours!!! Especially with Mohammed (:",

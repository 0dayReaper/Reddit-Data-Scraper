From people in your living group who have taken the class, from office hours, or whatever resources are available. In most classes, weekly psets should take no more than 4 hours. I'm dead serious. There's PLENTY of time for sleep. Don't listen to anybody who says it's not possible, they're just trying to drag you into their misery as well.",

Normally, the professor will indicate how much psets are worth in the final grade.\n\nIf you know that finishing that part that's really hard is only worth 0.25%, it may not be worth staying up an extra hour for it. Use the value of psets as a resource that you're exchanging sleep for. At some point, it's not worth it anymore.",

Seven hours was my sustainability target. \n\nThe other thing is to take short looks at the work early. Some classes (eg algorithms) make progress by reading the problem and doodling and then waiting for a bus.",

So, stay in the gym, or club, or rehearsal, or whatever it is you do outside of school!",

Going to every lecture helped keep me in a rhythm with school. I learned to start p-sets early, and ask during lecture about material i didn\u2019t understand in the p-set. I guarantee most profs will know you\u2019ve started your work early and they\u2019ll be eager to assist you when they see you\u2019re putting in the work early and trying to stay on top of things. \n\nAlso take everything everyone says about how hard a class is with a grain of salt. 2.005 and 2.006 for example were talked about as hard and grueling, but if you showed up to lecture, asked for help, and did the set reading; they turned out to be some of my most memorable classes at MIT.\n\nAka find what works for you, and don\u2019t let anyone else sway you from that. If you need group study? Do that. I preferred to work alone until I\u2019d had a crack at the material on my own.",

Second semester freshman year I took six classes, five of which had weekly homework, and that just burned me out. After that, I took no more than 22 or so hours of lecture/recitation time a week and started doing homework during the day, between classes, a little at a time, several days before it was due. This wasn\u2019t always possible; sometimes a problem set due Thursday was based on stuff presented in class on Tuesday followed by readings on Tuesday night or Wednesday. But arranging my time so that I didn\u2019t need to burn the midnight oil, especially in classes I didn\u2019t particularly like, was uplifting.",

I have no idea what the student insurance covers these days, but there are tons of great options in the area. I go to Beth Israel and highly recommend them, but it's out in Longwood. MGH and Cambridge Health Alliance are closer to MIT and have good reputations. \n\nBe aware that wait times to get your first appointment with a new doctor in the Boston area can be very long. However once you become an established patient with your new doc/clinic they have emergency appointments open for current patients when you need them, and most doctors are very accessible via phone or patient portal for any concerns.",

            "comment": "In my experience, while the urgent care at MIT medical totally sucks, everything else at MIT medical is either great or average. I used them for all my medical care for 8 years and was generally very happy (and actually quite sad that I needed to find new doctors when I graduated! Most of my classmates felt similarly. Not sure why there's an enrichment for bad MIT medical experiences on this subreddit.)   \n  \n  \nTo address your specific question: I had fine experiences with Chana Wasserman. But also, a lot of the PCPs at MIT medical can do routine gyn care, like pap smears, inserting/removing IUDs, etc. I'd suggest my old PCP, but unfortunately she has moved on from MIT.   \n  \n  \nIf the other comments here have scared you off MIT medical, since graduating I have had good experiences with Atrius health. In particular, Sara Ellison. She used to be at the Cambridge office, but now she's all the way out in Davis. Again though, the PCPs at Atrius can do routine gyn care, so unless you've got something non-routine going on, you don't actually need a gynecologist specifically.  \n  \n  \nOh one last thing I remember - I did see one gynecologist at MGH one time who I specifically didn't like: Sujata Somani.  She wasn't awful, but I wouldn't go back again.  \n  \n  \nHope this is helpful. Good luck and welcome to MIT :)",

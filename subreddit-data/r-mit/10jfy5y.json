How much work was it, was it worth doing or would you have rather just paid rent ?\n\nAlso do you think it would be better to become a GRA for graduate housing instead ?",

            "comment": "GRA here. Being a GRA has the very highest highs and the very lowest lows. All in all, it's a unique experience that I'm glad to have done, but it's absolutely not for everyone. \n\nBeing a GRA puts you in a lot of difficult situations with some truly heavy shit. Mental health crises are some of the more common ones, but truly no two situations are identical. Being a GRA has made me grow immensely as a person (which can be uncomfortable and scary at times), taught me a lot, and made me so much more empathetic. Your 30 students will have 30 wildly diverse experiences of college.\n\nYou'll experience what undergrad culture is like at an extremely-high-pressure institution in a way that very few grad students get to see. Honestly, I think that anyone who wants to be a professor someday would benefit from seeing student life from \"the other side\" - being a GRA has made me way more understanding of things like late assignments during my teaching. \n\nLogistically:\n\n* Know that being a GRA will probably delay your PhD completion date by a semester, on average.\n* Crisis response is a big part of the job. I'd say that 95% of the time, being a GRA is pretty chill - maybe 5 hours / week, baking a few cookies, shooting the shit, and so on. The other 5% of the time, it can easily be &gt;40 hours / week. Furthermore, you really can't predict when those weeks will be. Make sure you and your advisor understand this. Frantic 3 a.m. knocks on your door happen. Hospital trips, police-on-hall, mental breakdowns, sexual assault, relationship violence, addiction, suicide - all unfortunately happen. I know GRAs who have stayed up all night sitting beside students in acute crisis to stop them from harming themselves. You need to be responsible, kind, patient, and cool under pressure.\n* The Pareto rule applies - you'll spend 80% of your time with the same 20% of undergrads, probably even more lopsided than that. Despite what DSL says, the true main roles of a GRA are to: a) reduce the chances that a student slips through the cracks and has no social support, b) be an on-the-ground \"first-reporter\" to triage crises, and c) provide a bit of cover-your-ass for DSL's liability.\n\nThe free rent is an extremely nice perk, no doubt. But you definitely earn every cent of it as a GRA - don't go into it thinking it's a free lunch.\n\nI should reiterate that being a GRA is also a super rewarding experience too. It's really awesome watching freshmen grow into seniors and become independent, measured, and brilliant adults. Personalities change and grow. Students discover new sides of themselves, reinvent themselves, fall in and out of love. The students are generally wonderful and will make you smile a lot! I'm glad I'm a GRA, and if I could go back in time, I would choose to do it again. Just know that GRAing isn't all roses.",

I didn't want to be a professor but the free rent did contribute heavily towards my post PhD life and allowed me a bit more freedom relative to what most PhDs need after graduation. It was a trade though, I'm definitely still a bit mentally scarred from some of it.",

            "comment": "Speaking as an undergrad who has helped with the selection of a GRA: The process of becoming a GRA is not exactly a walk in the park. Essays, recommendations, and several interviews.\n\nUndergrad communities are very involved in the interviewing and reviewing of GRA apps. So, if you are mostly interested in it for the free rent and not the emotional labor of it, it is unlikely you will get the GRA position to begin with. \n\nMy GRA and her husband were the backbone of my living community. While most of the year for them was hosting chill study breaks, they were also the first person over thirty young adults would go to in times of crisis.",

Also, free food, camaraderie, etc, etc.\n\nThe main benefit is that you get guaranteed housing for the duration of your service. Otherwise, you'd have to play the lottery (run by Housing) to see if you'd get a spot (however, once you got the spot, you'd keep it \"forever). So, essentially, you've got the lottery as an incoming student (where you're practically guaranteed a dorm spot) and then you'd either take your chances with the lottery, or become an officer. After 2 years of exemplary service, you could be recommended for guaranteed housing.\n\nDisclaimer: I graduated MIT 4 years ago, so things might have changed since.",

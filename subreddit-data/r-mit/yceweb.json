He returns to MIT and registers here, in solidarity with underrepresented MIT students. He votes in our September primary and November midterm. **Do all three votes count?**\n\nAn Elections Division manager here says: They sure do!\n\nCf. *Black\u2019s Law Dictionary* (20th ed. 2015). \u201cResidence usu. just means bodily presence as an inhabitant in a given place\u2026. A person thus may have more than one residence at a time.\u201d",

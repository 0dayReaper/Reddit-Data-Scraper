It's also starting to crumble. His obsession with waves of steps makes both buildings spectacularly inaccessible to those in wheelchairs.\n\nWe can be grateful MIT doesn't have the obligatory brutalist library building that so many campuses built in the 1960's.\n\nI think the Beaux Arts main campus buildings are an interesting combination of classic architecture with technically modern. They are curtain wall buildings, the walls are not load bearing. That allows the large and very efficient double-hung windows. It also made the interiors very flexible, the interior walls can be moved easily.\n\nThe paint scheme on the exterior of buildings 16 and 56 was simplified to save money, they were more interesting with the original paint.\n\nAside from Stata, the rest of Vassar St is *boring.*\n\nKresge and the Chapel are gems, and thank goodness they did a very sensitive renovation. Shame about the added sprinkler pipes inside Kresge, but there really was no other option. It would look really cool if it had the original white plastic Orastone roof, but it failed within a few years.",

Due to complications with construction, the school most likely won't be doing anything like those again.\n\nA building doesn't have to look futuristic to be futuristic. The proposed buildings are more futuristic than you think. Take the brick for example, it's most likely locally sourced as well as the other construction materials. Brick is a wonderful building material due to its shape and thermal properties, which is why most of the buildings in Boston are made of brick. These proposed buildings are most likely eco friendly and Sustainable, something much more important to the future than a building that looks futuristic but has a negative carbon footprint and isn't sustainably built.",

The infinite and walker are well executed stately buildings. EC and Senior Haus too. \n\nBut 66, the Green Building, all of Sloan, the media lab extension, Kresge, the Z Center, Student Center, stata, and Simmons are all bland and boring versions of contemporary styles. Even Baker is pretty boring for how interesting a concept it has. \n\nI think they did ok with some of the buildings on Vassar, like the BCS building and the Broad, but generally they just seem to have a habit of imposing stylistically conservative constraints on avant-garde designers, leading to a bland bowdlerized version of contemporary. \n\nLike, it may be apocryphal, but the received wisdom re: stata at the time was it was a generic design Gehry was just sitting on - not something he designed for MIT\u2019s needs specifically. Whether or not that\u2019s true, it does have a feel of \u201cgood enough\u201d in a way most of Gehry\u2019s work does not. Admittedly I don\u2019t like his style much anyway, but compared to other campus buildings he\u2019s done Stata feels extremely uninspired. Or maybe he was inspired by the blandness of what was at MIT already?",

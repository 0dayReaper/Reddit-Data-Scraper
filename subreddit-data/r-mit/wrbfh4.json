I appreciated how walkable and relatively compact the campus was (although things may have changed recently with how closed the campus is for outsiders). \n\nIf you move across the river, it might be a good idea since the walk to campus would be a lot farther.*\n\nAlso, iirc, the streets and sidewalks used to get really nasty with all the salt and snow in the winter. Idk if that should pose a maintenance problem for scooter riders compared to bike riders. Maybe a current student can chime in?\n\n*I think they still have SafeRide shuttles that go across the river to pick up/drop off students.",

My Brompton was easy to store in my office, easy to take on the bus/train/uber/lyft, easy to maintain and fun for commuting. Now I live in a place where it is suicidal to commute by bike. \n\nLooking back at my time at MIT, as a student I think having a foldable bike would have made it easy to store it in a dorm room or off to the side in most classrooms/lecture halls. I'd even be able to travel with it on an a flight back home too! The same can be said of a scooter but generally one can travel farther and faster with a bike.",

They are easier to store and take with you into vehicles and buildings but they are also prime targets for thieves. \n\nI never felt comfortable locking up my foldable bike outside so I always was burdened with taking it with me everywhere when it wasn't stored in a secure location (my apartment or office).\n\nI sometimes envied that my colleagues with old road bikes never had this issue!",

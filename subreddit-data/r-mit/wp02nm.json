    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nHarvard student looking to cross-register because the equivalent course at Harvard interferes with one of my other classes. I have absolutely no coding experience and need a foundational class that won't kill me but through which I will be able to learn Python and the foundations of computer science / coding. \n\nHas anyone taken 6.100A or 6.100L (I know it's new so looking to if anyone has any ideas or insights) and if so, what was it like? Would you recommend it? etc. \n\nThanks a ton in advance!",

            "comment": "6.100A is the new name for 6.0001. Not new. In fact, most MIT students take it. 6.100A is a half semester class often followed by 6.100B (formerly 6.0002). 6.100L is just 6.100A, except they stretch it over a whole semester so you have extra time to do each pset. \n\nImo coding is a lot like math, and most MIT students soak up that stuff like we\u2019re a piece of bread dropped in water. If you want to take 6.100B, take 6.100A. If you want more time for this, 6.100L. Both will leave you with the same knowledge, it\u2019s really just the timing.",

There\u2019s also some ppl who will take 6.100b a later semester, test out of 6.100a, or just never take 6.100b, but if you take both it\u2019s basically just one continuous class, except with a grade for both halves. \n\nOne option might be to start in 6.100A, see the first assignment, and if it feels too fast, drop into 6.100L. Be aware that I don\u2019t know anything on how easy/hard it is to add/drop when you\u2019re cross registered from Harvard. \n\nIf you don\u2019t plan on taking 6.100b, 6.100L is a more reasonable pace. On the other hand, taking just 6.100A leaves you with more free time the second half of your semester when all your other classes are getting tough. \n\nAlso- if it\u2019s a major requirement, definitely double check to make sure you don\u2019t need 6.100b.",

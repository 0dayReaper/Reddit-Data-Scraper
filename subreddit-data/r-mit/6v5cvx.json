Maybe you don't need to; someone with more expertise can chime in.\n\nIt's probably not going to destroy your rods and cones *directly* because they aren't specifically absorbing that light, but e.g. magnifying-glassing the sun onto your skin will still burn it, in the blunt diffusive thermal damage sense.\n\nThen again, OP isn't blind yet... *edit*: Oh sorry, apparently besides burning the retina, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photic_retinopathy can occur from photochemical reactions to light? Weird... I'd be a lot more worried about that, since maybe the damage is not immediately noticeable.\n\nMaybe you can cover a magnifying glass with this thing and then measure the temperature of the focal point... *edit: this was a dumb suggestion on my part; you'd need to do a lot more tests since it's apparently not necessarily heat that's an issue; you might have light-induced oxidation*\n\nOtherwise pretty clever.\n\n*edit*: I guess this photo was taken with a cellphone camera, which likely was seeing a tiny bit of the IR spectrum unless it had an IR filter.\n\n*edit*: Obligatory fearmongering [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6v47ob/ama_request_someone_who_fucked_up_their_eyes/dlxnveg) and [dubious source](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6v47ob/ama_request_someone_who_fucked_up_their_eyes/dlxxxnr).",

I have not found on Harvard's website if there are pre-requisites or if an incoming first-year graduate student can take the class.\n\nI cannot really find a place detailing the process so I wanted to hear from people who have done this, or even better took the same course.",

Obviously needs a decent understanding of QM, and appropriate math background, but I'm sure you'll be fine. Harvard also isn't very strict about prereqs. The basic philosophy is that it's your own damn fault if you take a class you're not prepared for ;).",

Don\u2019t they have a bunch of theory phds coming in who need to take QFT before any advisor would wanna work with them? No theory advisor will advise you in research unless you\u2019ve had QFT and their specialty (like GR or high energy) at the basic minimum. I feel like there\u2019s no way QFT 1 wouldn\u2019t be offered in the fall at any school lol",

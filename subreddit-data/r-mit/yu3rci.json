    "postText": "We are researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) studying social media users' affective responses to stories about chronic illness and disability\\*\\*.\\*\\* Your participation in this study should take no more than 30-45 minutes and you can take the survey now!\n\n***Participants can be enrolled in a raffle to win one of 5 (5) $50 Amazon gift cards.*** To enroll, please provide an email address at the end of study *(so that we can contact you with a gift card link).*\n\n**Survey here:** [https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_br50tmpyNW8hLam](https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_br50tmpyNW8hLam)\n\n***During this 30-45-minute survey, we will ask you to:*** Complete a screener (&lt;1 minute), fill out a baseline survey (approx. 3 mins), fill out several brief questionnaires (approx. 10-15 minutes), engage with several brief stories and reflection prompts (approx. 10-15 minutes), and complete additional and follow-up surveys (approx. 10-15 minutes)\n\n***Why are we conducting this study?*** *Much of what we know about the world is learned through stories. Our online and offline worlds are inundated with narrative content. And while we know much about the ways in which stories make us think and feel, we know little about the effects of stories focusing on personal health journeys, which are an important part of both individual identity and professional lives. This study explores adults\u2019 affective (emotional) responses to such stories.*\n\n***INSTITUTION APPROVAL INFORMATION:*** *Our survey has been deemed safe and appropriate by MIT's IRB (Institutional Review Board) and COUHES (Committee on the Use of Humans as Experiment Subjects), and all study personnel have received certifications in performing safe and ethical human subjects research through the CITI Program (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative). If you wish to learn more about our university approval of this study and survey, you may contact MIT COUHES office (*[*couhes@mit.edu*](mailto:couhes@mit.edu)*) and reference our protocol approval number (#2210000771), or please feel free to ask me any questions here!*  \n*This survey lasts approximately 30-45 minutes.

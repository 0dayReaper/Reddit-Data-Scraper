If you're looking for anyone to fill a lease, or if you'll be subletting this summer, please reach out!\n\nAbout me: Male, 21, flexible price range (anything reasonable near or below 2k). I just need to be somewhere in range of the red line. Looking to start after June during the summer.\n\nDM me through Reddit and we can talk further :)",

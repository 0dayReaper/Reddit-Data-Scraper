    "postText": "The fix-a-flat guy was out doing his rounds in Kendall Square, don't give him money. \n\nFor anyone new to Cambridge, his whole shtick is that he claims his car has a flat tire and he needs $x to fix it, he only does it near ATMs so people can't say they don't have cash on them. He's nice until he's not, and then he gets angry and ramps up the pressure. \n\nHe goes after the college kids and foreigners who are trying to do the right thing and don't know better. I told him to take a hike in the middle of scamming an undergrad and he proceeded to follow me shouting profanity into the chipotle. Please be safe out there.",

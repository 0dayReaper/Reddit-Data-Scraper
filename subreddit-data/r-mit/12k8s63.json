    "postText": "After haggling down 80k a year to 43k a year MIT still seems like a poor decision over Georgia Tech which would cost 10k a year. We\u2019re already 2 appeals in and the decision date is May 1st. Is MIT worth approx. 120k in student loan debt? Pursuing a degree in CS, specifically AI, and really wanted to use the CSAIL MIT provides. But 120k of debt seems like a poor choice. Any input?\n\nEdit: Has anyone heard of successful transfer pathways into MIT from a community college?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all of your input, I\u2019m not looking to be a Quant, ideally FAANG. But my end goal is a startup which is where the AI education came in. Was looking to hone in on the trade offs between both considering the fact the field is small at the moment. Eg. Would I graduate GT with enough opportunities to learn about details behind AI\n\nEdit: Thank you all for all of your generous contributions to my dilemma. all of your inputs have been so so valuable",

If you are interested in a field like quant, I would highly suggest MIT. The only issue with this approach is that this kind of locks you into needing a high paying job out of undergrad rather than one that you\u2019re interested in.",

MIT is very strong on startups &amp; entrepreneurship -- much stronger than GA.\n\nKendall Square around MIT has been called [the most innovative square mile on the planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Square).\n\nAs an MIT student you'll be constantly exposed to startup hackathons, pitch competitions, etc.   You'll have access to the Martin Trust Center for Entrepreneurship including [MIT's own accelerator program called deltaV](https://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/accelerator/program/).\n\nAnd even as an undergrad you can take great graduate-level courses like the renowned [15.390 New Enterprises](https://orbit.mit.edu/classes/new-enterprises-15.390) with Bill Aulet.\n\nBasically you launch a startup during the class, and most of your classmates will be elite Sloan MBA students who are on the Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation (E+I) track.\n\nThere are great startup scene in Cambridge &amp; Boston in general.  Every Thursday you can network with other entrepreneurs [at the Venture Cafe](https://venturecafecambridge.org/programs/thursday-gathering/) and there's a ton of events like the [Boston New Technology (BTN) meetups](https://www.meetup.com/boston_new_technology/).\n\nTL;DR: you wont have to wait to create your startup until after graduation and MIT is one of the best places on the earth to launch a startup.  You might even get funding long before graduation.",

            "comment": "An alternative opinion since I have no stake in this undergrad fight as I'm a grad alum.  I went to RPI undergrad (which is pretty no-name all things considered) and then to MIT for grad and now I'm trying to start a company. Undergrad is what you make of it. I went to RPI because of cost reasons and still feel like I did well with my education and opportunities. The undergrad education didn't feel like it was too different between schools. In general a lot of my grad contemporaries were from state schools or smaller schools. Yes there were the occasional MIT or Stanford B.S. students but it was much more mixed than you would guess.\n\nI think about it this way: the MIT name is a protection of opportunity and not a guarantee of opportunity. You will still have to do well at either school. At RPI the people who just barely scraped by generally didn't work in engineering at all after graduating or had a very difficult time getting employed. At MIT just about everyone got jobs in tech. The upper opportunities are similar for both schools but the lower is much lower at other places. \n\nIf you want to start a startup then my recommendation is to go with the lowest cost you can. You'll probably need a grad degree anyway and my lower loans from undergrad was a big factor on taking the leap as a founder rather than going directly into the 150k+ tech jobs.",

They have a career fair every September ([https://capd.mit.edu/channels/fall-career-fair/](https://capd.mit.edu/channels/fall-career-fair/)) where basically every company under the sun comes to recruit. Lots are for new grad jobs but also lots for summer internships. You talk to the company reps and if they like you, they may offer to interview you within a few days on campus at the career center. Typically, internships will require an additional 1-2 rounds of interviews after that (if you pass the on-campus interview). The last round may be an onsite interview (before COVID, they would fly you out for multiple hours of interviews. I suspect during and after COVID, they've just been doing Zoom versions).\n\nThere are other smaller career fairs that the departments or other groups will hold later (an example of a non-department career fair is the European Career Fair - [https://euro-career.mit.edu](https://euro-career.mit.edu)) , but these are much smaller. There's also a Spring Career Fair, but it's also much smaller than the Fall version because the fall is the prime job-searching season. The Fall has the most opportunities (when I was there, 10 years ago, the fair would totally fill up both levels of the gym which is big enough to hold a full ice rink and running track).\n\nI haven't been to other schools, but from talking to people from other  schools (even good STEM schools), they don't provide as many resources to help you find jobs or skills like resume-polishing. And not as many companies go there to recruit. The MIT name is really key in that regard.",

One thing to note is that hiring season starts fast, I felt like before I even really settled into the fall semester there will be career fairs and talks you gotta go to try to network.\n\nDefinitely personal projects and key advanced classes are things internships are looking for.

If you're passionate and hard-working, as long as you  go to a top 20 school, you're going to do fine.\n\nIt's all about ROI, and a general rule of thumb from student loans to a car loan, is that your absolute max loan amount should be less than your salary. In CS, you'll get 160K (cash+bonus+options) within 5 years, so it could be worth it. But then, is a difference of 120K significant? Yeah.\n\n&gt;Has anyone heard of successful transfer pathways into MIT from a community college?\n\nYes, two people actually. But this process is INCREDIBLY hard and rigorous. You're better off going to GT\n\n&gt;Would I graduate GT with enough opportunities to learn about details behind AI\n\nYes, of course. What matters in CS anyway, is being interesting (ie doing personal projects / engineering teams) and acing your interview (leetcode). So do those things while at a top 20, and you'll get anywhere.",

You can always get into quant later in your life without locking yourself down.",

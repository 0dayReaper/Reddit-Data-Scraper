Never directly used the material of course, but it was my most enjoyable math class\u2026\nPleasantly surprised he is still around, TBH. Was on my list of cool ppl probably no longer with us (RIP Woodie Flowers)",

Taking your course was what first inspired me to work really, really hard on mathematics and academics and consider applying to American universities - I didn't quite make it to MIT haha, but I'm super excited to keep on growing in both knowledge and curiosity at Columbia, and hopefully check out all those awesome lecture halls in person one day for my grad studies. :)",

On the very first day of class he wrote his office number on the blackboard (this was before the ubiquity of cell phones) and said \"if I'm not in class by 10 past, call my office\".  We all chuckled.  About 2 months later, lo and behold, he showed up 30 minutes late to class and berated us for not calling him (the like 12 of us that remained).  This guy was one of the factors that made me choose to be a math major.",

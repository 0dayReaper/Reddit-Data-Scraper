Access to any opportunity in the world, as long as you can figure out what it is that you want. With that many amazing people, every room you walk into has a dozen people who can give you unimaginable opportunities (including your fellow students). I love telling the story of hanging out in a dorm lounge with my friends one day, and one of them talking about how he\u2019d love to work for McLaren someday. My other friend turns to him and goes, \u201cOh, I met a guy from McLaren yesterday, and he was looking for interns. Want me to get you in touch with him?\u201d \n\n3. Nerd hogwarts. Secret societies and rooftop adventures and underground tunnels covered in art and the craziest labs and maker spaces and murals and nerf gun assassins and so much more to explore.\n\nand for bad\n\n1. Very hard classes. Very, very hard. Not impossible, but very, very hard. You learn a lot, and sometimes you end up suffering to do so.\n\n2. Not really much good Indian food here. :((",

(India Castle, Gandhi, Haveli, etc.) Supposedly one Indian family had like 4-5 restaurants with each of the kids running different ones. Mostly around Central Square.\n\nI see India Pavillion, Punjabi Dhaba, Shanti, The Kebab Factory, and The Maharaja are still around although I haven\u2019t been there in years (and they are relatively far away).",

    "postText": "I am starting college next fall with the intent of going into Chemical Engineering. However, the last time I took biology was in freshman year where half the year was virtual and a complete shit show. Overall, my understanding of life sciences is kind of limited. My teachers have recommended that I enroll at my community college in order to have a deeper understanding of biology since I never took AP Bio but I am not sure which courses would be sufficient. Is AP Bio on the same caliber as Intro to College Biology 1 and 2? Are there any online resources that are recommended as a supplement? I\u2019m honestly so nervous about the course rigor of college and anything can help lol",

I didn\u2019t have any APs available at my high school and very few advanced honors classes and didn\u2019t know half the symbols they drew on the boards, much less how to actually start understanding equations. It may be worth glancing over one or two of the beginning open course ware lectures just to make sure you know what they expect you to know, but otherwise I think intro bio (at least 7.01x) classes do a pretty good job at actually teaching.",

If you\u2019re worried, just take whatever 7.01X class they have on freshman PNR. \n\nFor the straight 10 track, the only other class that you would run into any more biology is 7.05/5.07 around probably sophomore spring, but you could dodge that by taking either organic chem 2 or inorganic chem. \n\nIf you get sucked into the 10-B void, then you would have to take an entire biology minor. That being said, if you retain at least the major points from your 7.01X class, you should have all the tools you need to take those classes.",

Like if I am feeling a certain extreme feeling about something, isn\u2019t there a reason? Shouldn\u2019t we listen to the signs our body gives us instead of suppress it?\n\nIf any MIT students who are taking medication would be willing to share their experience with me, I would really appreciate it. Please feel free to email me (malek8@mit.edu) if you don\u2019t feel comfortable posting here. Thanks\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you guys so much for all of the thoughts and insight. It goes a long way",

            "comment": "If you had diabetes, would you feel the same way? Would you refuse to take insulin just because your body never needed it before and should be able to make it on your own? If this is something specific to it being a mental problem, is this potentially arising from your biases and feeling of stigma around mental health? Most of us need help at some point in our lives, for physical and/or mental issues. For most things mental health related, a combination of medication and psychotherapy has been shown to be the most effective intervention. For the type of psychotropics that I\u2019d guess they are suggesting, long term \u201caddiction\u201d isn\u2019t particularly a concern. It might help to think of it as putting on your oxygen mask as a support system in order to deal with the actual issue (eg plane crashing). You can taper off the oxygen mask once the underlying issues have been dealt with. Ultimately, it is your decision, but I\u2019d ask yourself what you have to gain and what you have to lose. Ask questions about coming off the medication, how long it takes to see effects, and so on. You could always ask to start with a therapist and decide on medication later. Without knowing the full details of what is going on, this is the best I can offer. Best of luck with everything.",

            "comment": "I think this depends largely on what you are going to take. Maybe ask them to explain exactly the risks and side effects of whatever it is. Some mental health drugs, like benzos, can be harmful if taken over a long period of time but help a lot in the short term. Others are fine when taken long term, there is no chance of \"addiction\" but there are structured methods for getting on and off of them because they change the chemistry of your body. There is no shame taking medication for any illness, physical or mental. Are you also talking to a mental health professional about your feelings about this?",

Shouldn\u2019t we listen to the signs our body gives us instead of suppress it?\n\nOk, i get this. But medications for mental illness don't give us a pass on dealing with \"the thing\"-- the big thing/the big feeling, whatever it is for you or for me.\n\nInstead, they do two things. Well it's kinda the same thing: they  adjust our brains in whatever way we need- dial down the stress responses/dial up the happy chemicals/etc (whatever your personal issue is). And that allows us to #2, THEN *better* deal with the original thing. \n\nLook, you got a big brain, a smart brain, an adaptive brain. I know that because you're there (I'm not, I'm a parent). There's something about the way you process the world that sets you apart from the rest of us in a very positive way. \n\nSo I like that you're trusting your brain and asking this question. I think that's probably very intelligent of you. It's not a bad intuition or deduction. \n\nBut I'm also thinking of your intelligence like this: there's something going on in your life that you/your intellect/your soul is having a hard time figuring out. \n\nI think that if you perhaps allow the medication to work on whatever the stress response is doing to you, whether it's taking away good stuff or flooding your brain with bad stuff, it might help you get out of your own way.\n\nI see it like this: the meds will take care of that small part so that the rest of your big ol' brain will actually be able to work on the \"bigger issue\" or \"bigger question.\"\n\nThey (professionals) probably aren't looking to SOLVE whatever it is with meds and the meds aren't going to make this bigger thing go away. But they will be a sort of aid to that. \n\nGive your big old brain the bridge it needs for now, for support, so you can stabilize and move on to solving the bigger issue. \n\nWhich I personally think you CAN DO and have the ABILITY to do, given who you are (although I'll admit I'm biased as the parent of an MIT student).\n\n#I wish you nothing but peace and here's a HUGE mom hug too \u2764\ufe0f You got this! I have zero doubts.",

            "comment": "I felt the same way when I was in a mental hospital. I felt like the world was against me, like I was surrounded by a bunch of strangers who didn't care about me, and like it would make me feel dead inside. I also had a very extreme reaction to being prescribed medication, but I ended up taking it and it helped me. It wasn't anything life changing, but it helped me through some really rough days after I left. I realized after the fact that the people in there did care about me, that's why they were there in the first place. You might not be able to see it now but they are trying to help you in whatever way they can, and I can guarantee they have helped others in the same way.\n\nI can't speak for how your experience may be, but I was hospitalized over year ago and I haven't needed my medication for months. Medication won't ever be the answer to anything, but it can help numb the pain when you're at your lowest. Change always comes from inside you, nowhere else. I hope you can achieve your own inner peace, good luck!",

            "comment": "I never went to a mental hospital per se, but am currently taking medication for depression/general anxiety/panic disorder due to being unable to do anything at all when attacks came (and they came often). I do think different meds definitely have different side effects, and depending on the dosage of ur meds, how it affects how much u feel \"u\" could change as well, but the road to bettering ur mental health (at least my mental health) wasnt one thats necessarily easy.\n\ni definitely do agree and feel u on the worry of becoming reliant on them - ive thankfully gotten over this worry after finding a med that fits pretty well w me (im pretty prone to obsession/getting addicted to things, so was extra wary, but found that the meds I took at least had no such thing). i was worried itll give me some kinda happy high that i wouldnt be able to get my hands off them, but quite contrarily i think i personally have found myself able to feel things better (both highs and lows) since the depression noise that ruined those signals went away.\n\nA very important thing to note as well is that i personally found it VERY hard to listen to myself and my body's needs when emotions came flooding in. the smallest critique of my performance (whether from myself or others) just felt *so* personal i wasnt able to even process *why* it felt so personal. Processing my emotions just wasnt an option when my eyes were bawling, my hands trembling, and my heart running.\n\ni think starting light could be a good idea, and make sure to tell ur doc right away if u find the med ur taking is making u feel a certain way ur uncomfortable with(the first med i started on made me SO drowsy i broke two beakers and kept drooling when the dose was slightly upped lmao).\nim unsure what mental struggles ur going thru, but i think at least considering meds as a possible crutch to help u process ur way to mental health (like glasses for bad eyesight) could perhaps help. no matter which route u choose - meds or no meds - i hope ur able to find a method that works for u to feel more comfortable!",

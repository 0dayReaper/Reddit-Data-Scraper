    "postText": "Feeling extreme doubts that I belong here and that I can get through this program, let alone achieve my goals or attain any type of fulfillment, in one piece. Last week I worked 74 hours, pulled two all-nighters, and got 4 hours of sleep a night on average, and I am still not even close to being on top of my load. The week before that I worked 63 hours. Is this what MIT is supposed to be like?\n\nI cried harder than I can ever remember last night because I was so upset with myself for putting in as much as I was putting in, and not feeling like I was getting anything out. What upsets me so much is I know there are people out there who are putting in less work than me and getting more done, and I just don't know what to change or if I'm just doomed to be like this for the rest of my life. \n\nAs the semester comes to an end, I am seriously considering quitting, even though it was a lifelong dream of mine to be here. I still remember the day I got the acceptance letter and how excited I was, but I'm not sure I can sustain myself through this and I know it is only going to get harder. \n\nThe other day, I had an oddly subliminal dream, where I somehow got myself into a situation where I was a pilot and had to fly a commercial airplane in a few hours, even though I had no idea what I was doing. Ultimately, as the flight time neared, I ended up choosing to not fly the plane, which I felt like was the right decision. But when I told my mom about my decision, I felt a sense of disappointment from her I've never felt before, and I could tell she was also so worried about all the people I had left behind on the flight. The dream ended with me returning back to feeling like a kid again and play soccer with some old time friends. \n\nI'm sorry for putting all this out there, I'm just trying to make sense of things, and wondering if maybe it's a message that I should drop out and return back to what made me happy as a kid.",

            "comment": "OP, I'm really sorry you are going through this. I would like to offer a tiny glimmer of hope. \n\nI went through something similar, and what helped me was reducing the number of classes I was taking (to 36 units literally), getting therapy, and limiting extracurriculars to only the things I enjoyed doing (vs. doing things that would go on my resume). There is time to build your career after MIT, but I would hate to see you go before you try taking things at your own pace (assuming you haven't already tried that).\n\nPeer pressure can put you in a dark place, but you aren't competing with anyone here. Try to isolate yourself mentally from other people's pace and progress and try to gauge your own path and the pace at which you can comfortably walk it.",

            "comment": "Man, I feel like I could have written this as a freshman. Here are how things worked out for me OP, but everyone's journey is different. Just putting it here as a reference. I went to a public high school (2000-2004) in a very underserved area. Our graduation rate at the time was about 60%. I never really had to work or struggle in high school. Everything was easy and in could basically show up to class, and get an easy A. Hated writing essays and doing homework, and most of the time I didn't have to. I got into MIT. \n\nThen freshman year I hit a wall. With the effects it had on me, might have as well been a physical wall. I remember a week where I pulled two all-nighters in a row and started hallucinating. It was rough. I was not doing well in any of my classes. But I started learning coping mechanisms. \n\n1: spend an hour or so on problem sets, try to see if you can solve it/how to go about it. But after that, do everything in groups. Find a group of people in each class and do problem sets with them. If there are questions the group can't figure out, leave them blank. \n\n2: if you don't get the chance to do a problem set, do not turn it in. It isn't a big deal. Not a huge part of your grade. Your sanity is much more important. \n\n3: if you have severe ADHD (like I did) for gods sake seek medical attention. We don't begrudge a person without a leg a Prosthetic one. Same deal with neurodivergence. If you need some help to concentrate, seek it now. You will struggle with it all your life. \n\n4: (almost) never pass an opportunity to socialize. Your mental health is the most important thing in your possession. Figure out what makes you happy. Gathering in small groups? Going to larger parties? Dancing? Being in a relationship? Figure it out and spend time doing it. You will end up being happier and might find you end up doing better. \n\n5: for gods sake do not try to double major, or do a minor. Not just because it is unnecessary stress (which it is), but because literally no one cares outside. You will have so much more use if you spent that time doing research in the field of your interest than adding a line on your resume with 2nd major or a minor. It is abso-fucking-useless. I say it as a person who did a double major. One of the biggest regrets of my entire academic career. (did a PhD after spending 2 years in the industry after MIT).\n\nAs for my story, I did not learn the above all in freshman year. I feel like the only thing that made me stay at MIT after freshman year was that summer. I did a UROP and I loved it. I think I figured out that it was what I wanted to do. From then on, I worked q UROP both during the year and the summers  and somehow it made things better. It was nice having something I was good at. I also had plenty of time during the summer for activities, explored Boston and Cambridge, and had lots of friends by then. I also learned to sail! Great place to take partners to impress them (but only if you get good enough not to capsize)\n\nI still struggled a lot sophomore and junior year. But I started to figure things out over that time. It wasn't really until sr. year that I really felt like I knew wtf I was doing. Also, I got into my first relationship then, and things felt great. I went from having B- grade average with a few Cs pepperd in there, to almost straight As Sr. Year. \n\nSo here is my 2 cent. See if you can stick it out. One of the valuable lessons of MIT is really to show people how hard they can push themselves and when you can't brute force your way out of it, how to find a different path. I feel like my life after MIT has been relatively easy (piece of cake PhD and a postdoc that never felt overwhelming) and I owe most of that to MIT. Feeling like if you make it there (especially if you are one of the people who struggles) then you can do absolutely anything in life. \n\nThat being said, nothing is worth your life, or long term mental health. If you feel like you are going to damage your health, cause self harm, or anything of the sort, don't even wait until the end of the semester. Seek help or stop, quit, maybe come back at a different time, maybe don't. \n\nI had two friends who both quit MIT. Both are extremely successful right now. Remember you will always have what got you into MIT.",

Probably the more education you get the better chances you will have later. But I have friends with PhDs and no job and have friends with PhDs with jobs and a life I will never have. \n\nWhat matters to me is that I\u2019m happy with what I have accomplished because of my given circumstances back then. I wish I hadn\u2019t quit but it was too much back then. \n\nOne benefit of this is that I love learning new stuff on my own at my own pace and I don\u2019t hate any subject. With fresh and a new eyes I love learning only the things that I care and find useful. The system didn\u2019t leave me any traumas and I find fascinating what\u2019s ahead of me professionally.",

Fast forward my family depends on me, I have no formal education and life is ok. All the time and money I would have spent in school I spent building a business and professional network. I don\u2019t know if this is a great path for you but it worked fine for me. I can stop working today and live for a few decades without working.\n\nOne thing that I would have invested more is in good friends. I used to have a really strong relationship with my best ones but a decade later realized they were just using me. Unrelated but if I would go back this is where I would pay the most attention. Be careful with your closest people. Chose wisely. You are valuable.",

            "comment": "Been there!  Some things I\u2019ve learned in the 25 years since since college.\n\nEnlist help: Can you start enlisting more help? When I was in college, I felt like life was a solo sport. Turns out, life is not a solo sport. It\u2019s a team sport. Ask yourself what kind of help would help you. Maybe you would benefit from a tutor. Maybe you need help with study skills, a therapist, or someone else. Ask yourself who should be on Team Monkeymalek.\n\nFace time: Go to office hours at least once in every class. It never occurred to me in college, but people who go to office hours get better grades than people who don\u2019t. Some of it is learning. Some of it is the benefit of demonstrating you care. I ended up teaching at a good university, and the kids who came to office hours also ended up forming relationships with me that got them recommendation letters and job connections.\n\nPlanning: Plan your time and work really carefully. Really wait to do the distracting things and the fun things until you\u2019re done. You\u2019ll have more fun if you\u2019re not stressed. \n\nTime arbitrage: Use summers and IAP to make your school year easier. If you\u2019re about to take a class that requires a certain skill, get better at that skill before the class starts. Use OCW to preview classes before they start. \u201cPreparation prevents piss poor performance.\u201d\n\nMore time arbitrage: Absolutely no more all nighters. They make you stupid and tired for several days. You run at a deficit that makes everything so much harder. Be the only person going to bed at the same time every night, and make it an early time. 10 pm. Whatever it takes. Get up early, too. \n\nMore time arbitrage: Go to class, pay attention, and review your notes each night. It works. Helps things stick.\n\nMis en place: Become crazy organized. Prepare at night for the next day. Make sure everything is set before you start working on anything. Keeping your space organized helps with mental health and feelings of overwhelm.\n\nThere\u2019s more, I\u2019m sure, but you can do this. Just change how you\u2019re doing it.",

At some point, I lost the ability to pull all nighters, I just stare at my phone trying to stay awake and regretting my decisions. Lower your course load, develop a work life balance. MIT has a toxic work culture, but you don\u2019t have to grind yourself into the ground to get through it. And reflect on why your struggling. Is it your study habits (always start with practice problems, rarely does the exam deviate far from those), is it unfamiliarity with course load (consider taking intermediary classes/ additional pre-reqs)? Reach early and often. But most importantly, get some sleep.",

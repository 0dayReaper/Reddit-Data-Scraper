    "postText": "My dream school was MIT when applying for undergrad; however, I was rejected and ended up at my state school. I\u2019ve loved me experience there thus far (rising junior!)\n\nNow that I\u2019m entering my third year, I am deliberating what to do for graduate school. I plan to get my masters immediately after I graduate. The problem is, I have the option to do an accelerated Masters program at my school (only one extra year). This is a great opportunity and will save me money. However, I am contemplating whether or not it is worth it.\n\nMy plan was to go to my state school, and apply to a more competitive graduate school. But a friend pointed out that I would be taking a huge chance applying to a super competitive grad school. I have no guarantee of getting into a school as great as MIT. In order to take the chance and apply, I would have to turn down the accelerated masters.\n\nI want to ask the students here, is it worth it???\n\nAre the resources MIT offers worth taking a chance on, or should I just save the money and stay where I am?\n\nI\u2019d ask my advisor but I doubt they can remain impartial.\n\nFor context:\nI\u2019m an aerospace engineering student. I have a 3.73 GPA. This should go up for the rest of my time in college (hopefully 3.85 by graduation)\n\nMy current school is ranked Top 30 for aerospace.\n\nThis summer I\u2019m working as an undergraduate researcher with one of my professors. The research pertains to the structural mechanics of spacecrafts. I\u2019ll likely be doing this research throughout the entire year. I\u2019m in a few engineering clubs already, and will be joining the space exploration club next semester. Hopefully I can get a great internship for next summer.\n\nThank you to anyone who read all of that!",

But, other than it being your dream school, why do you want to go to MIT? What are you expecting to get out of it? \"Resources\" is pretty vague unless you have something in mind.\n\nRemember that it's possible to get two master's degrees. It's also likely that you, if admitted, will be able to fund your potential MIT degree through research assistantships.",

Is it because you\u2019d have to commit to the extra year at your current school before you\u2019d hear back from MIT? Or because you\u2019d arrange your coursework differently if you were planning for the 5th year masters and then wouldn\u2019t be able to graduate on time for a masters at MIT?\n\nIt just seems like a very unusual situation\u2026",

The only question is is it worth it?\n\nThis is coming from someone who did a 5th year masters, but also from **someone who kinda sorta prefers industry over research, so weigh my opinion accordingly**\n\nA 5th years masters at your state school, which doesn't sound like a bad school, will be better than going to MIT for a 2 year masters because first off: **you can jump straight into your studies because you already** ***know*** **your state school, and you get one year off!**\n\nI can not understate that the overwhelming feeling of wonder and imposter syndrome and frankly, task-paralysis (or its cousin: partying every weekend) that you felt your first year in college is gonna happen again. But if you stay with your state school, you already got over that. **You're already a part of clubs, you already know the staff and other people, it's going to be super easy to just be a master's student straight up and do exactly what you intend to without being caught up in a culture shock.**\n\n**Second, you get one year of your life back!** One more year to be in industry compared to a \"traditional\" master's student which you can also use to intern, or travel, or take a gap year straight up. Time is the most important thing in your life, don't you forget it.",

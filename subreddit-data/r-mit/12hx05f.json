    "postText": "My parents technically own 2 houses. We live in one of them. The mortgage and loan for our new house is roughly $620,000+. My parents paid off the mortgage and debt on the other house after a decade and it\u2019s valued around $300,000. They are planning on selling that house to pay off some debt on our current house. They make less than $30,000 a year. MIT is making me pay $27,000 per year. I\u2019m broke and my parents broke. Does MIT consider the debt on our primary residence?",

Because you're right, things aren't adding up here. \n\nA while back, there was a high schooler who ranted about how unfair it was that according to FAFSA/CSS their family was expected to contribute 70k+ a year (basically, no aid), because though their family made 200-300k a year (or something like that), they \"only\" had about 80k leftover each year in discretionary income after paying for all their expenses (food, transportation, mortgage, other unlisted stuff). Never mind that many families in the US don't even make 80k to start with, I guess.",

Even with a super aggressive payment schedule unless your parents have a lot of undeclared income/cash under the table. \n\nFor higher income earners you make 100,000 and pay taxes on that 100,000 which sometimes leaves you with 60,000 if you don\u2019t have any deductions. This is just for simplification. That 60,000 is what you have left over to pay for mortgage, car, utilities, college. \n\nYou need to redo the financial aid and your parents need to submit their actual taxes to css and Fafsa. \n\nIf your parents got the loan ten years ago it was super hard to get a loan with 30,000 income. The requirements were super strict back then because it was after the 2008-2009 market crash.",

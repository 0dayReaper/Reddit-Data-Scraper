    "postText": "Hi r/mit! I was recently accepted to MIT and will probably be committing to the university. I applied as a course 6-7 (CS and molecular biology), but now I am thinking of a different path: a double major between CS, econ, data science and molecular biology, with a HASS minor. Do you guys think it is possible or should I just do course 6-7 as my main major, with a minors in econ and HASS? (i think you are allowed to do 2 minors, right?)\n\nI'm also very worried about the rigor of MIT. I was rejected from stanford and princeton, waitlisted from harvard (but got into the other ivies inc yale, columbia), so i feel like an \"imposter\" getting into MIT. i know this question has been asked so many times before this, but i'm just really worried.. the thing is, i'm decent at biology (do olympiads and such), so i think i can manage that if I continue working hard, but i'm worried about CS. I have done the MIT BWSI summer program, so I know Python, but nothing else in CS (haven't taken too many CS classes in high school). I guess my question is, how can I start preparing for MIT this summer? I'm planning to study the course material for all the classes i want to take (through MIT OCW/ textbooks) this summer, but what else can I do? \n\nThanks!",

I was so worried about the rigor coming to MIT but truthfully (and I\u2019m saying this with a grain of salt) MIT is a very much you put in the work and you will succeed culture. Like the environment here is designed for you to succeed. I have friend who will send me there Psets/HW if I\u2019m behind, there\u2019s review videos and lecture recording for exams, and so many things it\u2019s crazy. I think what makes MIT hard is not using these things to your advantage and trying to solo it secluded in your own room. If you truly just go through MIT like your meant to it is amazing and relatively easy*",

But definitely hard to do both; it's just way too many credits.\n\nRigor-wise, like someone else said, the place is pretty much how much you put in is how much you get out. As long as you start stuff early and stay somewhat disciplined, getting by is not really that bad (it will never guarantee you an A though).",

For example, in my personal opinion, lab classes are usually the \"easiest\" to get an A in because consistency and completion are the biggest focus.\n\nBut for more standard classes, you can do everything and get 100% (psets, miniquizzes, etc.) and still fall in the median for the exams (i.e. a \"B\"). If you manage to stay focused, do the practice exams on time, and try to keep some mental cohesion of the content (i.e. try to not be \"lost\" for too long), getting an \"A\" becomes more manageable\n\nThing is, MIT takes a lot of time so doing this is not always possible (there will be weeks where you'll be tired and just not pay attention to class; exams for which you speedran the practice exam the day before the actual exam; classes for which you get 70% of the content but not 100%; etc.). At least for me, being here has kind of made me accept that, sometimes, there are just \"good semesters\" and \"bad semesters\", and while I can put the effort, a single thing can always throw the momentum off.",

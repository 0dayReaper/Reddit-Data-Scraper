    "postText": "I am an incoming first-year PhD student.  \n\nSo . . . today's self-selection process was a mess.  I work during the day, so I couldn't log-in.  A potential roommate of mine tried logging in, but the site was slow, crashed, etc., like countless other people mentioned.  \n\nI called HRS a few minutes ago, and they said that all current grad housing occupants were supposed to notify MIT if they were renewing for another year, or leaving come July 31st, or whatever, back in April.  And apparently there are some people/units who they have not heard from.  But apparently they don't know how many rooms/units that amounts to, or when they'll be posted . . . which is a pretty dissatisfying and not-very-believable answer.  \n\nThe only advice I really got was \"Just check the housing portal periodically between now and July/August, and different units/rooms might become available at unpredictable times.\"  \n\nI don't exactly know what I am asking for.  Mostly: advice/thoughts?  \n\nAnd also, if anyone among you out there happens to be a current grad housing occupant who hasn't notified HRS about whether you are renewing or leaving come July 31 . . . uh, you should PM me, and we should totally try to coordinate something with HRS so that I, along with a prospective roommate or two, can sign-up for your room/unit.",

(We can't check what is available during the off-hours, which is also dumb, so I'm just going off of memory.)  \n\nI don't think I could afford $1745/mo at the Warehouse, and also it's for first years only so that would not be good for a potential renewal into a second year.  \n\nTang might be possible, depends on what was actually available though, since I don't fully remember, as I was only outside of work today for a few minutes talking through all this with my potential roommate.  We were really looking towards either Edgerton, Sid-Pac, or Ashdown, though.",

    "postText": "I'm an MIT student and I just got covid. I was wondering what the covid experience of other MIT students was?\n\nI'm really worried about long term effects of covid or long-covid and how that might get in the way of my ability to study or concentrate or retain information. Have people been noticing that long term effects are likely? The CDC says that even vaccinated, young people can have long term effects and that makes me really worried.",

            "comment": "I'm not sure anecdotal evidence by MIT community members is particularly instructive. A postdoc--not a student, yet I like to think I'm still young--but I got Covid during the spring wave, despite being fully vaccinated and boosted. It sucked for a few days (headache, fatigue, sore throat, night sweats), in particular having to give a Zoom lecture when you couldn't stop coughing. I haven't noticed any lingering cognitive side effects. In any case, worrying about something that you don't really have much control over is not productive. Relax and rest!",

I was unable to get one in a timely fashion during my bout due to lack of an established relationship with a primary care provider.",

I\u2019ve spent time in the long hauler groups and there\u2019s nothing that can reliably prevent it, even paxlovid. But if you\u2019re especially fit/healthy or have hypermobility, it is a correlated risk factor (which is a lot of people around college age). \n\nFor context, my boyfriend and I got the same infection and he\u2019s fine but I\u2019m not. Most MIT students who got covid do not experience long hauler symptoms at a rate lower than the average population (only about a half dozen I know of, even with like 75% of undergrads campus getting that one outbreak). \n\nBrain fog wise - if you\u2019re having issues talk to DAS or S^3 and get accommodations. I feel like my brain is leaking out of my head most days but I\u2019m still on track to graduate. ALSO, don\u2019t talk to MIT Medical about long covid, they will gaslight you. A good PCP wherever home is for you or one local is better, but still a gamble.\n\nTL;DR don\u2019t panic and it\u2019s definitely not the end of the world if you are long hauling. it\u2019s a balanced and unlikely risk. take care in the meantime.",

Go to a different, legit doctor's office or hospital--there are hundreds of better options in the area. After graduating and accessing real medical care elsewhere, it becomes blazingly apparent how sadly inept MIT Medical is. And that was something I realized even before hearing about the completely incompetent ways they've treated staff and students with covid issues specifically. \n\nWishing you a speedy recovery, and most likely you will be fine! But if you do need help, be smart about where you get it. If you want to try and get paxlovid, the state has a telehealth service set up for this exact purpose: https://www.mass.gov/info-details/free-telehealth-for-covid-19-treatment-with-paxlovid",

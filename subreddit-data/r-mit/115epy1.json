But I'm not sure why you say that \"you can't write in funds for a master's student\". You can ahah. It's a graduate degree just like a PhD.\n\nYou pay for your Master's (meaning you pay tuition fees and don't get a stipend) only at Sloan (MFin, MBAn, MBA, etc.).",

They recommended that if you want to get in, gather together whatever research, publications, and presentations you've done so far (if you've done nothing then you should probably look elsewhere) and go down the list of professors to find the most relevant.\n\nCheck Google scholar for their recent publications because that'll be indicative of what they're working on right now.\n\nThen email them with a blurb about what research you've done so far, an abstract or very short executive summary, and a request for a position under them. Hopefully an informal interview as well.\n\nThen, after all of that, apply. Don't apply if you do not already have a professor on the inside willing to vouch for you and provide a funded position because unless you've cured cancer, you'll be in a massive pool trying to get in to a handful of non-committed slots.",

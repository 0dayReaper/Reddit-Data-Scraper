    "postText": "I\u2019m going to major in math (and possibly also physics) and I\u2019m really not a fan of biology. It\u2019s great that some people like to study it, but to me it seems like too much memorization and not enough math. Does anyone know which introductory bio class would be best for someone who\u2019s more mathematical and just not that into biology? \n\nAlso, I should note that my school didn\u2019t have AP bio (I took GT), so my preparedness for MIT\u2019s biology classes is probably not that great.",

I remember one professor being really good and the other being terrible and psets being relatively infrequent and quick to do, though that was fall 2016 so it definitely could have changed. iirc 7.016 was the most chemistry-oriented, though they may have changed since then",

I took 7.013 and I found it challenging and pretty problem-solving based vs. just rote memorization.",

In general, they're all tech schools but each have their own unique flavor due to student culture and interests, geographic placement, and academic opportunities.\n\nAs great as MIT is, it's not good at everything! There are programs at WPI (like Actuarial Math) that neither MIT nor RPI have. The same can be true for the other two like Hydrogeology at RPI or Linguistics at MIT.",

            "comment": "The way to get an education that stacks up against MIT, outside of MIT: \n\n1. Make sure the school you enroll in requires that professors have open office hours, enough for you to use early, and often, and long. \n2. Use. Those. Office. Hours. Every last minute. You're going into debt for this, so use those office hours. \n\nI don't know how good WPI and RPI are about having office hours, so that's definitely something to ask the undergrads who are already there.",

            "comment": "I went to WPI for undergrad in ECE. On the whole the school has gone the way of admins treating students like a piggy bank, giving themselves *enormous* inflated bonuses and salaries at the expense of professors, which has led to a very disgruntled faculty.\n\nThat being said, the community was excellent, and I've had friends who have gone to both say RPI's social life is worse, and almost every job I've gotten since is because the hiring manager also went to WPI, so it still holds some weight in the engineering world.\n\nI might consider Northeastern if I were you. I'm going there for my MS right now in ECE, and the professors seem to be more invested in the students. Better facilities and you'll still be in Boston, actually a 20 minute walk from MIT.",

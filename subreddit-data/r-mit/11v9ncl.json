    "postText": "I have no clue what to do in this situation. I won't give too much detail, but at Vanderbilt I'll be paying about 5k/yr (merit scholarship). I was also accepted to MIT a couple days ago but got no aid.\n\nMy parents would be able to cover about 60k/yr, and we would likely have to take out about 20k/yr in loans to pay for MIT. It could probably be done, but I might want to go to grad school and also my siblings will be going to college after me. \n\nI dont know what to do. Vanderbilt is a great school, but MIT is MIT and is obviously amazing for Cs. Is the price of MIT worth the difference? Or should I take the Vanderbilt offer?\n\nAny advice is welcome, thanks sm!!!",

It's worth asking because CS tends to be a low-GPA major. Going to Vanderbilt and losing the scholarship due to grades would be the worst outcome.",

Also if your siblings overlap with you in college, your family\u2019s aid eligibility may change in those years.\n\nMIT is MIT. It\u2019s a special place, but it\u2019s also a special place. Attend the prospective student days and make sure it\u2019s the kind of special place you want to be a part of. If it is, then go, major in CS, get a SWE job out of school for a year or two to pay off your loans and learn to program, and then go do literally whatever you want.",

But in reality, there is much more to \u201cprogramming\u201d than can be taught in 3 years of 10-20h/wk in a problem set format.\n\nI was \u201cone of those kids\u201d \u2014 I \u201clearned to program\u201d at 5 with Pascal and later basic games in HyperCard (dating myself again, but tickled that this iOS device still autocorrects Hypercard -&gt; HyperCard), built a bunch of web apps for clubs in high school, got my SB and MEng in course 6, and then landed at a FAANG \u2014 where I promptly faced codebases with tens of thousands of lines of code, documented and undocumented APIs and behaviors, entirely unfamiliar development and production infrastructures, a product backend built on top of a shoehorned infrastructure that wasn\u2019t designed for it, and a team split across the country.\n\nSo, before I could use what I\u2019d learned at MIT about computer system design and human interfaces (which, to be clear, was a lot and would be very valuable!) I first had to figure out how to be productive and independent in (1) grokking a large, unfamiliar codebase \u2014 impossibly large to read line-by-line \u2014 and making changes to it, and (2) writing complete production systems from whole cloth.\n\nTook me about 6 months to become anything other than useless at the FAANG. I left about a year in for a startup with a couple other alums. There I learned to build production systems from scratch.\n\nAll told, about 2 years.\n\nThough, really, that was just the beginning.",

MS in CS is useful in some circumstances, but rarely do folks do it for the pay boost, which as you note is minor.\n\nThat said, MBA programs are a whole different beast. They are almost always paid for by loans (except for folks from hyper-wealthy families, of which there are many at top schools), and are very expensive to begin with. The assumption is that post-MBA you will go work somewhere very wealthy and, again, will pay off those loans relatively quickly. Most folks with an MBA are seeking roles in consulting, banking/investing, or high-level positions in product or business \u2014 and in very different roles than what most CS undergrads are targeting.\n\nI will also say that the value of an MBA drops off *precipitously* once you\u2019re looking past HBS/GSB/Wharton/Sloan \u2014 and it will be much easier to get in to those programs with an MIT degree, especially when paired with some industry experience.\n\nBut even then a top-tier MBA is not necessary for access to \u201cmanagement positions\u201d \u2014 in the tech world, many of the folks in management just have a BS or MS in in a technical discipline. (Outside of tech that\u2019s less common.)\n\nGood news is: you don\u2019t have to decide any of this now! See where your interests take you. Don\u2019t expect your parents to pay for any degree past undergrad, because they won\u2019t have to.\n\nIf you like MIT, go to MIT if you have the chance. If you don\u2019t, don\u2019t!",

Undergrad is what you make of it, especially with respect to building the sort of research credentials that will make you a strong grad school applicant. You\u2019ll probably get better letters from a professor you work with closely and learn a lot from, and letters matter a lot in grad school apps. \n\nIn my experience, working closely with the actual professor who writes your letter is not very likely at MIT. MIT professors optimize for research, not teaching, and that applies to the UROP experience (grad students handle most of the mentoring and usually ghostwrite letters for grad school etc) as well as to classes in some cases. \n\nThe undergrads I\u2019ve worked with at my current university (really good school, but not MIT tier in rankings) are focused, thoughtful, and smart. in my opinion, people mythologize MIT students a bit too much. you can find hardworking, interesting people pretty much anywhere if you look hard enough (except harvard).\n\nalso, debt is expensive!! college where you don\u2019t get a ton of aid costs a lot, and interest on student loans is wild. some kinds of loans still accrue interest when you\u2019re earning your PhD, and your stipend, even in the best case, won\u2019t allow you to make much of a dent in that debt. \n\n\ntl;dr: go to Vanderbilt. you have all of your life ahead of you to not be in debt and find great people, no matter where you land.",

I (meaning my family) would have to pay around 22k a year, but I have comparable offers from Yale, Columbia, some other ivies and a full ride from Wake Forest and UT Dallas as a \"Mcdermott scholar\" (similar to OP's Vandy)\n\nLike you said about Vandy, I know that at Wake/UTD, I would be the \"main character\" especially if I double major in CS and biology (I plan to do course 6-7 at MIT).. however, Wake CS is literally ranked 140 nationally (and UTD is ranked 170 nationally overall), and Wake only got an engineering dept in 2018.\n\nLike OP, I plan to do an MBA after my undergrad, hopefully making it to HBS/ Wharton/ Sloan/ stanford business and getting a good job afterwards. what would you say about my situation? (and also, i'm also thinking of a phd as a possible path as well, what are your recommendations about that and which field are you doing your phd in?)",

It also has a CS grad school, and it\u2019s really easy to get at least a Master\u2019s degree as a CS undergrad \u2014 the only reqs are a 4.25/5.0 GPA and some research.\n\nI\u2019m an alum but I also went to another school arguably in a similar tier to Vandy for 2y during my undergrad. It sounds pretentious, but after being at MIT, everyone at the other school seemed really \u201caverage\u201d. There is really something to be said about MIT admissions and their ability to pick exceptional young adults.\n\nThe MIT career fairs are also frequented by the most prestigious companies in the world, in case you want a fallback from grad school. If you get a job software engineering at a FAANG you won\u2019t have to worry much about paying off your loans.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have more questions.",

Also CS programs at HYPSM-level schools are very similar in material and still give you a distinction in the job search (if that matters).

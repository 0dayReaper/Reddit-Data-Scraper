I\u2019m a first year and i feel so behind everyone else here in every class. i can\u2019t find the motivation to do work and the things that come so easily to everyone else i struggle with.\n\ni guess my question is is it normal to get Cs and Ds and is it bad to use an NR freshman spring?",

And something a lot of people at MIT haven\u2019t encountered before, which makes it feel weirder than it is.\n\nBut also, consider talking to an advisor or a counselor. Lack of motivation and feeling like you\u2019re failing might mean that you need some extra support. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask for it!",

Going early and often can allow them to give you whatever resources you may need. More than once they would give me a week or more extension on HW when I was to busy. \n\n- A course 2, 2021 graduate",

After each lecture, I review the material at my own pace and answer questions that I generate during class while listening to the lecturer. These questions serve as a guide. Next, I answer the questions and summarize important concepts, ideally in my own words, on flashcards (anki). Finally, I review and practice with these flashcards frequently (ideally once everyday).\n\nAlthough this method is time-consuming, it is a price I am willing to pay. \n\nThere are also many videos on YouTube with ppl sharing their studying techniques. It\u2019s always insightful to see what worked for other ppl. I wish you best of luck!",

Not sure how it works now.  \n\n\nI barely made it through freshman year, I came from a small town and had no calculus in high school and eeked out Cs in 18.01, 18.02, 8.01, 8.02, 3.091.  (I got a 27/100 on a 3.091 exam I was unprepared for, the professor kindly let me retake it, and I still only got a 67 or something).  \n\n\nBottom line, I made it through.  I was course 6-3 and once I got into classes in my major (and learned how to study) I got mostly As and Bs and the occasional C for the rest of my time there and graduated in 4 years with a 4.1/5.0 GPA.  On the down side, I always felt dumber than everyone else - that's OK.  It's partly \"imposter syndrome\" which still bothers me, and partly that you're surrounded by the smartest people in the WORLD.    \n\n\nYou can do it too.  Use the resources you have, don't be afraid to fail, don't hide from your advisors, and get through it one class at a time.  And it will get better after freshman year if you keep working!",

You\u2019re now amongst the brightest minds in the entire planet. The pool just got WAY deeper. I also worked at Harvard and Northeastern and I can tell you that the curriculum and MIT is incredibly academically rigorous. Your intro to physics class is basically two Harvard classes mashed together.\n\nThis shit is hard. \n\nI\u2019d say the best thing you can do is readjust your expectations a little bit to be kinder to yourself. And also\u2026 Find something fun to do! Cambridge and Boston are awesome cities with tons of fun weirdos and hobbies. I\u2019ve seen cool stuff happening at maker spaces, folks learning stand-up comedy, ballroom dancing lessons, sailing, light saber practice on the quad. \n\nYou have to find some thing to let off some steam.

    "postText": "I want to download the lectures and listen to them while I commute, but a lot of lectures require the use of visuals like slides or equations. However, some don't. One example is Yale's [philosophy course \"Death\"](https://oyc.yale.edu/death/phil-176). You can pretty much listen to it as if it was a podcast.\n\nIs there any course available on MIT opencourseware that could be followed without having to visually see the videos?",

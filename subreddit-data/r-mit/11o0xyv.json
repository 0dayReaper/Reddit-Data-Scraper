I hope I\u2019m not encroaching on your subreddit too much, but I\u2019m trying to figure out a criteria for my upcoming college search, and proximity to a city has been a big consideration of mine.  I was just wondering how Boston is incorporated into the life of an MIT student.  Do you guys see it as an essential part of the experience?  Or does the closeness to a city not matter as much in your opinion?  Thanks!",

I picked MIT mostly because it's in a city near the ocean. Definitely spent a lot of time in the city and still do despite the fact I am now an alumni.",

There's big things like Fenway games and concerts, TD Garden to see a Bruins or Celtics game, I was just at the Wang Theature to see Taylor Tomlinson a few weeks ago. When I lived in Eastie we would go to Downeast and Tall Ship on the weekends all the time. Spent a lot of time in North End just exploring and getting food - Monicas has a really great itallian sub. Bar scene is pretty good if you adjust to the fact that things close at 2. The commuter rail is also $10 for unlimited rides on the weekend so you can go to beaches on north and south shore, see Salem in October, go down to Plymouth and see the very underwhelming Plymouth Rock. I camped on the harbor islands a few times which was super fun and a postdoc friend of mine went to Martha's Vineyard for vacation recently.",

There's a lot of other venues too so a lot of people do include Boston on their tours or at venues in the surrounding area.",

Heck, you might live in Boston if you move out to a frat, sorority, or independent living room. But sometimes life gets kinda busy so you don't really go out towards Boston and your daily route becomes the most direct route between campus and your dorm. After visiting my friends at colleges in more rural or suburban locations, I think being so close to Boston is a massive positive in terms of just having things to do when you're bored. You can also go north towards other parts of Cambridge or Somerville to find things to do. The only issues is that everything is expensive \ud83d\udc80 \nThere's some people I know who basically never leave the general proximity of campus though.",

Some people live in FSILGs or go to parties, but that's about it. Freshman year during breaks/holidays we went to visit some museums etc. Nowadays, we'd go once a semester to Cafe 472 or Spring Shabu Shabu. Everything else happens on campus for us \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Culturally, Boston and Cambridge are closer to each other than (say) Brooklyn and Manhattan.\n\nThe Boston metro area is a huge plus for MIT. Public transportation is excellent by American standards, but you might not even need it because the region is very walkable. Whether you like game stores, nightclubs, street food, major sports, museums, musicals, or luxury shopping brands, Boston has it all.\n\nThe only major downside of being in a desirable city is that housing is expensive.",

            "comment": "hi! current freshman here. last semester when i was taking 4 classes, I went across the river into boston around once a week to eat at restaurants, go shopping on newbury street, go to a concert, go thrifting, visit a museum, or hang out with people at my sorority house. i used bluebikes a lot and it was a really great experience. this semester, i haven't made it across the bridge much since i'm taking 5 classes, but i'm learning that i'd rather not do that again because i value that free time i had. i think boston is a really cool part of going to mit! it's up to you how much time you want to spend there vs on campus - it comes down to your personal values and how you allocate your time. but i would say boston is incorporated into my life as a fun place to visit each week to take a break from school.",

    "postText": "Grad housing has been discussed quite frequently, but I couldn't really find a answer to my question.\n\nI will be coming from europe to MIT during summer and assume that many students will not be on campus as there are no lectures. I believe that there will therefore also be limited events. I'd still like to live on campus and was looking into sublicensing for housing during that period. There are quite some options and I wondered if anyone knows whether Ashdown or SidPac offer better possibilities to socialize with people from MIT during these months. \n\nAny insights are appreciated!",

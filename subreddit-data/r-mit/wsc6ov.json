    "postText": "Hey everyone! Incoming grad student, I wanted to ask, are the meal plans really not worth the money? Even the cheapest ones? I don't intend on cooking the entire semester so would love the convenience of just grabbing something quick as I go about my day. From past (or current experience) what would you recommend? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.",

When I was a student it was literally cheaper to get Chipotle or Clover (2 takeout places close to campus) every meal of the day than to have a meal plan, and the meal plan prices have only gone up since then. Even cheaper to stock up on trader joes frozen meals. \n\nI never met a single grad student who bought any meal plan, and even among undergrads the only people I met with meal plans were people required to have them by their dorm.",

For free food I guess it was okay, but there were one like two things I liked and I think that would get old fairly quickly. Plus you could go to Flour or Saloniki or something every day for the prices they want for the dining hall",

I had a hard time because my degree was pretty specialized and my career had been in an industry that was pretty much going no where. There were plenty of opportunities... In China. So fuck that. I ain't getting arrested. Grad school let me broaden my educational base and been ok ever since. My advice is try to get a degree in something broad that can be applied to many industries.",

My postdoc is now still going strong after a year of not being able to find anything else. It really sucks. I'm tired of being a slave to academia.",

Part of it was my fault for not going about the application process in the best way: only applying to small companies in Boston, asking for too much up front, not searching out Jr position specifically, etc. But also many (tech) companies who just look at their bottom line don't care about how smart you are - all they care about is if you know this framework or that language. I'm glad I was able to find a place that does care about its employees though, as I've been able to avoid some of the terrible stereotypes a lot of these companies have.",

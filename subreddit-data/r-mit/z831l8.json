    "postText": "TL:DR Most buildings on campus will be open during business hours weekdays.  \n\nBuilding access changes starting December 1\n\n   \n\n[View online         version](http://inj9.mjt.lu/nl3/wWbyp9o__4EE7ruXyNvEWA?m=AU0AAAPPzhAAAcrs8RYAAAA822wAAYCrAjEAJb3mAAiQzwBjhlf3foB2FFK0Qs2-t6qUvmSe-wAIIWc&amp;b=f1ee2c5d&amp;e=addff36a&amp;x=9lo2Y6tbcdaseZ7tvT602g)\n\n\n\nTo the members of the MIT community,\n\nIn August, we [wrote to you](http://inj9.mjt.lu/lnk/AU0AAAPPzhAAAcrs8RYAAAA822wAAYCrAjEAJb3mAAiQzwBjhlf3foB2FFK0Qs2-t6qUvmSe-wAIIWc/1/rC19QyqMgGSyQQa29jGVZA/aHR0cHM6Ly9vcmdjaGFydC5taXQuZWR1L25vZGUvNi9sZXR0ZXJzX3RvX2NvbW11bml0eS9taXQtYnVpbGRpbmctYWNjZXNzLXBsYW4tZmFsbA) about our plans to engage the community as we developed MIT\u2019s approach to building access for the spring semester and beyond. We highlighted         our dual commitments to access and to the safety of all members of our         community, as well as our desire to keep [MIT\u2019s values](http://inj9.mjt.lu/lnk/AU0AAAPPzhAAAcrs8RYAAAA822wAAYCrAjEAJb3mAAiQzwBjhlf3foB2FFK0Qs2-t6qUvmSe-wAIIWc/2/JofqUPxLyDKbROhHH2tHnw/aHR0cHM6Ly93ZWIubWl0LmVkdS9hYm91dC92YWx1ZXMtc3RhdGVtZW50Lw)at the forefront of our planning and decision-making.\n\nLast month, we collected         your feedback through a building access survey. The survey presented         three scenarios to respondents: maintaining the current restrictions on         building access, reverting to the pre-Covid approach to building         access, or opening certain buildings during daytime hours. We learned         that members of our community place different priorities on campus         safety, ease of access, and a welcoming environment for visitors, and         that any successful solution must balance all of these values. The [survey results are         available here](http://inj9.mjt.lu/lnk/AU0AAAPPzhAAAcrs8RYAAAA822wAAYCrAjEAJb3mAAiQzwBjhlf3foB2FFK0Qs2-t6qUvmSe-wAIIWc/3/Ilc6HSC8cpR3_jWKitBYDg/aHR0cHM6Ly9pci5taXQuZWR1L2J1aWxkaW5nLWFjY2Vzcy1zdXJ2ZXk). \n\n## Building access updates\n\nGiven this community         input, we plan to expand the number of buildings that are open to the         general public. This includes restoring public access to the libraries         and the Main Group of campus buildings, including Lobby 7 and the         Infinite Corridor. Specifically, effective Thursday, December 1, the         Institute will:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Open many buildings to the public on weekdays during the day without requiring an MIT ID or Tim              Ticket, as indicated by the [orange dots on this              map](http://inj9.mjt.lu/lnk/AU0AAAPPzhAAAcrs8RYAAAA822wAAYCrAjEAJb3mAAiQzwBjhlf3foB2FFK0Qs2-t6qUvmSe-wAIIWc/4/3eT8daUqo-CBZyZ75-73IQ/aHR0cHM6Ly9pc3QubWl0LmVkdS9wdWJsaWMtbWFw). \n* Open other buildings to the public during stated public access hours, without requiring an MIT              ID or Tim Ticket, as indicated by the [blue dots on this              map](http://inj9.mjt.lu/lnk/AU0AAAPPzhAAAcrs8RYAAAA822wAAYCrAjEAJb3mAAiQzwBjhlf3foB2FFK0Qs2-t6qUvmSe-wAIIWc/5/kFnw9ACYD3fpbZrwDdFPbw/aHR0cHM6Ly9pc3QubWl0LmVkdS9wdWJsaWMtbWFw). \n* Open the turnstiles in Lobby 7 to ease access to the Infinite Corridor, with the intent to remove              them at the end of this semester.\n\nSee [additional details](http://inj9.mjt.lu/lnk/AU0AAAPPzhAAAcrs8RYAAAA822wAAYCrAjEAJb3mAAiQzwBjhlf3foB2FFK0Qs2-t6qUvmSe-wAIIWc/6/7O9KRAfxkkdrTPI5bTlaRA/aHR0cHM6Ly9pc3QubWl0LmVkdS9idWlsZGluZy1hY2Nlc3M) on these building access changes.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we will launch a working group charged with assessing potential security         enhancements in the Main Group and along the Infinite Corridor. \n\nThank you for your ongoing engagement on this important community issue. \n\nSincerely,\n\nCynthia Barnhart, Provost\n\nGlen Shor, Executive Vice President and Treasurer                 \n\nBuilding access changes starting December 1",

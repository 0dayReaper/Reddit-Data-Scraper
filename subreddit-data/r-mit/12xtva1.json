    "postText": "Does it involve a lot of math? From what I\u2019ve heard, Sloan\u2019s programs tend to be math-centric, and most of the finance students in courses 15-2 tend to gravitate towards quant funds. I want to know if the same is true for 15-1. I\u2019m planning on majoring in course 9 and doing pre-med, and math is not really my thing. I hope to go into biotech/healthcare consulting before med school, so now I am looking to minor in 15-1.",

It looks like if you take strategy-oriented electives, the most math you\u2019ll have is excel work in operations or adding in accounting.  If you\u2019re asking about majoring in course 15, there is a lot of variation in what math is used. My simple answer is probability and statistics followed by calculus",

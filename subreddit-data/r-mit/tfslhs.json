    "postText": "Hi there! I'll likely be coming to MIT as a PhD student this fall and I wanted to feel out the different communities on campus. Are there any clubs that people recommended for graduate students? I've heard about the Outing Club and the Triathlon Club, but not much else.",

            "comment": "* go to GSC orientation events to meet people outside your department\n* go to whatever department orientation events and other socials they have to meet people in your department\n* see if there are intramurals for any sports you enjoy playing\n* if you live in a grad dorm, go to the socials they hold \n\nOther than that, it really depends on your interests! If you enjoy social sports, dance, running, drama, or other hobbies that lend themselves to general socialising, I actually recommend seeing if you can find a local non-MIT group. Once I made more non-grad-student friends, it made my grad school life feel a lot more balanced and helped to put things in perspective when deadlines or class/advisor stress came along.",

You can search online for groups related to your interests or I hear meetup.com is a good way to find them!",

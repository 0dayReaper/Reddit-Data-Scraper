I had an amazing undergraduate advisor, but after I switched departments the new guy was just completely disinterested. He repeatedly suggested irrelevant, bottom-of-the-barrel courses just because they were alphabetically first in the catalog, and then tried to talk me into transferring out (thus forfeiting a full scholarship and needing to relocate my business and family) because of a single class.",

I was course 6 for a hot second as a sophomore and had zero contact with my advisor outside of 5-min meetings at the start of each semester for her to approve my course registration, no questions asked.\n\nIn course 16, my advisor was an absolute legend who actually cared about me, checked on me during rough semesters, gave me tons of advice about everything from personal issues to classes to careers to grad school applications, and would make time to meet with me whenever I had questions or just needed help.\n\nThe obvious difference is that there were literally &gt; 300 course 6 students in my graduating class, and there were probably \\~60 course 16 2021s.",

My friend who also had him had a similar experience. \n\nI wasn't super confident in myself at the time either so it was definitely super discouraging.",

Especially for young undergrads, the effects of those kinds of interactions and relationships stay with you for a long time.\n\nAs I look back at my undergrad years, I can honestly say that I was lucky that my advisor was a really nice guy and always responsive. But unfortunately he was very much lacking in actually advising. It seemed like he took a really passive approach and let me do my own thing however I wanted it to be done. I wish he would have offered more guidance, explained in detail the consequences of option a vs option b, etc. \n\nIt also didn't help that I was a 1st-gen student and didn't know what the heck I was doing (I was there before FLI@MIT)",

When I switched to 6-2, my advisor wasn\u2019t as helpful but that was my own fault bc I thought I wanted to focus on EE and picked an advisor in that area but then discovered I really preferred CS. Her other advisees who were 6-1s thought she was awesome\n\nMy first year advisor was in course 16 and he hadn\u2019t been a first year advisor before so he wasn\u2019t really familiar with the common schedules, but I got a lot of advice from my associate advisor that year (which I think are often more help for first years)",

Is anyone planning on attending this and willing to share notes? \n\nEvent info below:\n\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\nDisinformation Seminar Series: Paradoxical effects of Persuasive Messages\n\nSpeaker: Rahul Bhui\nSpeaker Affiliation: MIT Sloan\nHost: Dr. Una-May O'Reilly\nHost Affiliation: ALFA - CSAIL - MIT\n\nDate: Thursday, March 31, 2022\nTime:  04:00 PM to 05:00 PM\n\nLocation: 32-D507\n\nAbstract:\nThe same persuasive message can be interpreted in a positive or negative\nway, challenging our ability to predict its effectiveness. Causal\nreasoning can contribute to this process of interpretation and produce\nattitude reversals due to the network structure of beliefs. I will\npresent the results of two vignette experiments, one based on the famous\nslogan of the car rental agency Avis (\u201cWe're No. 2\u2014that means we try\nharder\u201d), and the other based on online product reviews. When\nparticipants\u2019 contextual beliefs about the economic environment are\nmanipulated, message effectiveness changes as predicted by a Bayesian\nmechanism in which seemingly negative information is \u201cexplained away\u201d in\na more positive light, or vice versa. Thus, causal reasoning may help\naccount for certain counter-intuitive kinds of high-level attitude change.\n\nSpeaker Biography:\nRahul Bhui is an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the MIT Sloan\nSchool of Management.\n\nHis research combines cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and\nbehavioral economics to reveal the deep unifying principles that capture\nboth rationality and irrationality. His work has been published in\npeer-reviewed journals such as Proceedings of the National Academy of\nSciences, Nature Communications, Psychological Review, and Psychological\nScience, and featured in media outlets such as USA Today, the LA Times,\nand Scientific American.\n\nPrior to joining the faculty at MIT, Rahul was Mind Brain Behavior\nPostdoctoral Fellow in the Departments of Psychology and Economics at\nHarvard University. He holds a BA (Hon) in Economics from the University\nof British Columbia, as well as an MS in Behavioral and Social\nNeuroscience and PhD in Computation and Neural Systems from Caltech.",

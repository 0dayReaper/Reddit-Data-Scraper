Then I'd spend IAP doing research, maybe take a fun class (I did the PE intro to ice skating one year, which was awesome), and possibly go on a trip for a long weekend (like MLK Day).\n\nFor my colleagues who aren't American, I saw some of them wait until after Christmas and New Year's to travel (depending on the cost of flights and etc) and so they were \"off\" during part of IAP. I know for a fact some of them would stay with their family abroad and do some work from home, but it was all definitely cleared with the advisors beforehand. If it takes 20+ hours to travel to your family, then I understand wanting to lump together your vacation time.\n\nIn general, the best time to take vacation seemed to be right after a semester ends, even if you're not taking a class, so IAP and the first two weeks of June tended to have people out of office more than usual. \n\nAll of that is to say that this is very much one person's experience, and I'm positive it's a little different in every group and every department, just like grad school generally is.",

Beyond suggestions in this thread (travel, focus on research, chill) I\u2019d recommend considering some of the stuff that happens during IAP. Great opp to explore startup ideas, take IAP classes, or even run your own thing during IAP (have had friends teach classes on everything from heavy metal music to stuff related to their research to unrelated things you want to explore with others). I know Covid changed some of this but worth considering",

    "postText": "I'm a prefrosh who's probably going to commit to MIT, but I have some apprehensions about mental health. I've heard that MIT is terrible for students with preexisting mental health conditions, and I'm worried because I self harm due to anxiety and I suspect that I have terrible seasonal depression (which the Cambridge Winters won't help). I'm wondering if you or anyone you know entered MIT with already shitty mental health and managed to be relatively successful. I'm also planning to visit Mental Health Services ASAP on campus to get help, but I'm worried that if I mention my self harm or passive SI I'll be forced to take a medical leave. Has that happened to anyone you know in recent years?",

            "comment": "I am currently a freshman and had a really rough start. I only managed to get 32 credits during the fall, which is the equivalent of 2.5 classes worth of credit. This alerted MIT CAP (Committee of Academic Performance), so I was forced to take no more than 48 units this semester, which felt constricting but whatever. The workload was definitely doable, but since I kept skipping lectures and putting off menial tasks (yayyy depression), I ended up failing my CI-H and another 6 unit class due to lack of participation. My mental health took a nose dive, and my SH and passive SI went up more than normal.\n\nI am definitely doing better this semester. I am taking medication for my anxiety and depression and staying away from egotistical people who make others feel like shit for not being as \"smart\" as them. I see this happening among freshmen since they are still caught up in the competition mindset. This seems to be not that common, but the minority can be quite loud. The upperclassmen are usually less insufferable and more understanding of your struggles.\n\nAnyway, you are not alone. MIT can be quite hard for people with mental health issues like us, but there are many resources. Most people I know go to therapy, so please do so. Take medication and talk to a psychiatrist, and switch to a different one if you feel you are not getting as great care as you could. MIT has S^3 (Student Support Services), where you can talk to people about your struggles, and they can help you with getting extensions on p-sets, waiving participation points if you cannot physically get to class, and other cases. Almost everyone I know reaches out to S^3, so it is not something to be ashamed of.\n\nAlso, stay away from people who are dismissive of your struggles or make you feel unworthy or inadequate. It is their own fault for making others feel this way. You will always meet people like this, no matter the college, but at MIT, along with the course rigor, can snowball into a dangerous mindset. Just be careful who you hang out with, and also call people out when they're being jackasses (only if you're comfortable to do so).\n\nAbout your worry with medical leave: I have talked to my psychiatrist about SI (not SH), and he did not put me on medical leave, not even close to that. We just discussed different potential medications to help. I don't know anyone personally who had to go on medical leave, but you are highly, highly unlikely to go through that bc of SH or SI. Unless you are actively trying to KYS (which I have seen personally, unfortunately) or failing all of your classes in two consecutive semesters, you should not worry about that.",

            "comment": "current student who came in with preexisting depression + anxiety and seasonal depression. it absolutely depends. there are a lot of people coming in with mental health stuff going on, especially in certain communities/dorms; there are also i think more/better support systems here than in certain other universities (in particular S\\^3 (student support services) is super helpful and understanding). i know people who have been hospitalized for mental health stuff and had a mostly good experience with mit admin during the process.\n\non the other hand, there is absolutely a culture of overwork, and if you're struggling it's easy to feel stupid or slow. for seasonal depression: yeah the winters are brutal. get a lamp. alternatively if you're considering another school located somewhere sunny you should keep the weather in mind. in doesn't sound that bad beforehand (ooh! snow!) but when you're stuck inside doing psets because it's freezing and cold outside at 4pm it is Not Great. \n\nre: medical leave- you should be fine. i don't know anyone who's had to go on medical leave against their will. \n\nfor actual actionable steps once you get on campus, assuming you choose mit:\n\n\\-set up an appointment with MIT Mental Health before you get here next fall. ideally a psychiatrist + a counselor. it's good to have these before something goes wrong/if you take medication, to manage your meds. my experience with the psychiatrists here has been very good. \n\n\\-email S\\^3 and let them know about your anxiety/depression and how it affects you. maybe talk to DAS, although they probably can't cover this. see if you can find an S\\^3 dean you like and set up weekly/biweekly meetings. \n\n\\-find a community you like! look around during rex, and feel free to ask people at different dorms about mental health stuff and pros/cons of the community. friends r great!!\n\n\\-look at the syllabus for classes you're taking to see if they offer free extensions/dropped psets or exams.\n\n\\-if stuff goes wrong: talk to your friends/the people around you. gras are sometimes helpful, as are heads of house; you can also talk to the dean on call from S\\^3, or set up an appointment. email your professors for extensions if you need them. \n\nhey. whatever happens, you'll be okay &lt;3",

I won\u2019t lie that it was extremely difficult, but finding the right provider @mental health and S3 will help make things easier! Also, as long as you have a consistent routine (I cant recommend enough getting 8 hours of sleep a night at actual nighttime), you\u2019ll be in a great position to be successful!",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am a student with a deep passion for the sciences, especially molecular sciences and have been developing a proposal to study the specificity and affinity of LPA binding to ORX. Recent studies have suggested that LPAs may act as endogenous ligands for certain orphan receptors, including ORX, but the specifics of this binding have not been fully characterized yet.\n\nI am excited to dive deeper into this topic and I was wondering if any of my fellow bio/chem/biochem students and/or graduate student in these areas would be interested in joining me in this pursuit? We will be identifying the LPA subtypes that bind to ORX, determining the affinity of LPA binding to ORX, investigating the specificity of LPA binding to ORX, and studying the functional consequences of LPA binding to ORX.\n\nIf this sounds like something you would be interested in, I have attached a more detailed proposal below for your reference. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or are interested in joining the project!\n\nBest,\n\nNick\n\nLink: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/15UZzFNkaMVi2y3stT1-scHZnpL7GXMCdBhCNcGcQ2zM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15UZzFNkaMVi2y3stT1-scHZnpL7GXMCdBhCNcGcQ2zM/edit?usp=sharing)",

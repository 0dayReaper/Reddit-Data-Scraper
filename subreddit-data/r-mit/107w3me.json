    "postText": "Hi all, this spring is going to be my last semester, and I need to take either 6.002 or 6.006 to graduate as a Course 6-9 major. I know they are not equivalent, but I'm wondering if anyone has thoughts on which might be more feasible? I'm a tired senior who hasn't taken 6.042 and is worried about struggling through 6.006. However, I've taken more computational Course 6 classes so I'm not sure how well I would do in 6.002. I'm also balancing my courseload with grad school interviews and would definitely appreciate any insight people may have! (Also I apologize that I don't have the new course numbers down lol)",

It's the hardest class (to get an A in) I've taken and the class I've forgotten the most; fuck that shit. \nI haven't taken 6.006, but I'd imagine it's more useful for you if your other classes have had a CS focus. Try to pick up 6.042 over IAP and see how it goes.",

            "comment": "As someone else as mentioned, Im not even sure if you'll have a choice of taking 6.006 without 6.042 due to new stricter preq enforcements. Worth asking\n\nAs for 6.002, I took it this past semester and it wasn't as hard as it was in previous years. Since 18.03 is no longer a preq for it, they now spend part of the class covering how to solve a differential equation instead of non-linear circuit elements and other stuff. As a result, I felt like I got a lot less practical use out of the class because I spent the so much time looking at diff eqs. However, the class still had psets, 2 midterms, 2 hour weekly labs on friday, and a final. So it was still several hours of work a week.",

            "comment": "I absolutely loved 6.006 but I also ended up going into CS theory so I may be biased lol. A lot of people talk about how they don\u2019t need/didn\u2019t learn anything in 6.042 and I totally disagree because I didn\u2019t have that background a lot of people seemed to prior to taking it. However, it\u2019s actually more needed for 6.046 than for 6.006. You need an understanding of big O notation, a reasonable ability to write proofs, and an understanding of what graphs are (in CS), but not most of the other content \n\nI didn\u2019t like 6.002 (and I also took it my senior spring to finish my 6-2 reqs), but it wasn\u2019t too bad. It was remote when I took it though so I didn\u2019t have to do the labs which was great. (It went remote partway into the semester so I had to do a couple labs at the beginning and I hated them with a passion.)",

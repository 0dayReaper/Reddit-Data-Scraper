These so-called publications are questionable in origin but sound legitimate on paper (if you don't look too closely). As having a long list of published papers is impressive for a high school student,\u00a0these \"achievements\" are used to win well-known\u00a0awards to build the CV. These awards were\u00a0used to bolster her school application portfolio. This kind of admission fraud scheme is difficult to spot, as this involves getting bona-fide credentials that were awarded using fraudulent means.\n\nHer paper\u00a0was withdrawn due to plagiarism from IEEE. \n\nPeople contacted schools and asked for the investigation since this group had many members. There were many people, not just one person. But the admissions staff didn't do anything about it. (I don't know how many got involved with the organized college admission fraud group, but probably way way more than people think).\n\nThat is why people are taking action. \nThe first petition was to ask for the investigation.This is the second petition. Hope there is the investigation for the sake of academic integrity and equity if opportunity in education.",

Let's take an example of her IEEE paper (the paper #1 in the google doc). When Korean media reports pointed out the plagiarism of this paper, the girl's father denied it. However, the paper just paraphrased two other sources in their entirety. Sneaky paraphrasing is a way of plagiarism. What's worse, this girl did not put any of her idea (not a single!) in the paper. What she did was paraphrasing and adding dummy sources of reference (to make it appear like a normal scholarly writing?)",

Appropriate action is taken based on the outcome of any review, and the Admissions Office does not discuss or disclose information pertaining to an applicant or their application materials\" in the referred article is not written in a past tense. It's general statement about the MIT policy. \n\nMIT did not release any of the information or outcome of the investigation, if any. \n\nWhat MIT told to the reporter for certain is \"However, I can affirm that MIT continues to stand by its offer of admission to Ms. Han.\" Does this comment automatically imply that the student is free from the questionable activities? That part is still hidden.",

Is there any additional info you can add to help me understand why?",

Out of the entire 2,300-word paper, approximately 56%, or 1,288 words, were copied. For example, \"has developed\" was changed to \"has been evolved,\" and \"are used to solve problems\" was changed to \"deals with problems.\" Additionally, \"cannot solve due to\" was changed to \"due to.\"\n\n I am wondering if MIT thinks that this is not plagiarism as it depends on their own academic ethics regulations.",

Good relations with your teachers (so they'll write you good letters of recommendation)\n5. Decent enough writing skills that the admissions officers aren't cringing every few minutes when they read your application. (If you can get a 1600 on the SAT, know how to use a spelling &amp; grammar checker, and can write concisely and precisely then you'll be fine here.)",

If it were today, I'd look for a fun law or history course.\n\nI chose something that complemented what I'd already taken.\n\nBack in my day, Course 6 only offered two courses on compilers. One was on design, one was on theory. I took both. Then I decided to take the Harvard compilers course because we'd get to *write* a compiler. And it turned out to be one of the more worthwhile things I've done. I printed and bound what I wrote and showed it at interviews (nowadays you'd just give interviewers your GitHub URL).",

            "comment": "A very long time ago I cross-registered for a course on energy policy taught by Dan Yergin at the Kennedy School of Government. Covered material that eventually wound up in his book *The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power*. Excellent course. But a lot of work, and particularly a lot of reading and serious analysis of written material. Very different from the MIT engineering mindset. Lots of time at their reserve book room. I got a gentleman's B-minus.",

It was far and away the most interesting class I\u2019ve ever taken at any educational level.\n\nI didn\u2019t know that it was called the gentleman\u2019s B-, but that\u2019s what I got too haha. Very different from the engineering mindset is the right description.",

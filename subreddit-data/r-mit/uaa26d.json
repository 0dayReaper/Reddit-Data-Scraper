    "postText": "Sunday, April 24, from 3pm-5pm at Kresge Auditorium, free\n\nIn its 21-22 academic year finale, MITWE celebrates its innovative/community ethos with premiere arrangements and by featuring guest performers from local public schools, MIT alumni, and its own members. Kenneth Amis leads the Boston-area premiere of his arrangement of Francis Johnson\u2019s Collection of New Cotillions. Born in 1792, Johnson was the first African American to publish sheet music. Continuing its exploration of Brazilian music, MITWE will present world premiere arrangements of three works by Hermeto Pascoal and Egberto Gismonti, arranged by Francesca Gaza, Sebasti\u00e1n Greschuk, and Oscar Latorre, and the MITWE Percussion Ensemble performs Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim\u2019s Surfboard.\n\nElgar\u2019s popular Enigma Variations, along with Bernd Alois Zimmermann\u2019s Rheinische Kirmest\u00e4nze are also featured on this special program, along with the MITWE Brass Quintet performing music of Victor Ewald.\n\nHonoring local music educator Cesar Garde (who has served Blanchard Memorial School in Boxborough, MA for nearly 30 years), the MITWE percussion ensemble will combine with 20 percussionists, grades 4 through 12, from the Acton-Boxborough Public Schools for the world premiere of The Master of Time by John McLellan.\n\nLink to get free tickets: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/onwardconnection-innovation-and-community-tickets-225966932177",

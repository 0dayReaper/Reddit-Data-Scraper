    "postText": "How should I go about geting a remote front end internship with in the next few weeks? I'm a freshman at a decent CS university. I have two front-end projects that use the classic three (JS, CSS, and HTML) and they're not anything mind-blowing but they show some level of competence in front-end design. I was really hoping I could land a job working on websites in my spare time but I haven't had much luck so far since my university isn't offering that kind of job anymore and a lot of the external applications I've been applying to seem to want a little more than just part-time, or just some who has more course load/ experience. What should I do?",

            "comment": "Uhh, this really isn\u2019t a question for MIT CS students. This is a general CS question. As of right now, it\u2019s a bad market for hiring in the Big Tech industry. Also, JS/CSS/HTML on their own aren\u2019t as useful anymore. A lot of industry now uses frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, and some other stuff to create websites. I would recommend expanding your skill set. You\u2019re also a freshman so you still have time.",

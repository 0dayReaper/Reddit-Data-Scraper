    "postText": "Hello! I'm a graduate student in search of some course recommendations. I'm particularly interested in interdisciplinary perspectives on creativity and creativity support tools. I've been looking in the catalogue for classes on the following topics without much luck:\n\n* The neuroscience of creativity and imagination\n   * Anything perception-related that falls into this area?\n   * More broadly: are there any brain-computer interfaces courses?\n* Applications of machine learning for creative practice (I come from a CS background, so I have some theoretical knowledge, but am looking to go deeper)\n   * Deep learning courses would be especially great!\n* Applications of materials science for human-computer interaction\n* Classes from different (creative) disciplines that you think have a really interesting take on creativity or communication\n\nAny thoughts on classes that fall into these categories, or anything adjacent? Or, apart from classes, any communities or activities you'd recommend exploring? Many thanks!",

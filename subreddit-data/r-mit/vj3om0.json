    "postText": "I'm sure that many people in MIT used to be the top in their high schools. No matter how hard a challenge seemed, you might always have had that sense of inner security that things will some how work out. You know that as long as you put in the hard work, you will do well. \n\nBut now at MIT, you meet all these people who are simply another level of genius, and you can't even comprehend how they do the things you do. For the first time in your life, you actually feel completely loss. Be it a problem set or research question, where you don't even have a clue as to where to start.\n\nHow do you deal with these kind of feelings? Like for the first time, you aren't the best (well an ego issue), but more importantly, for the first time you realized that you don't actually know how to solve problems -- or at least the new kind of problems which didn't always seem 'trivial' as it did to you as a smart kid. Specifically research questions, where you are literally probing new grounds and no one really knows the \"correct answer\" ahead as well - how do you even try to solve such problems??",

            "comment": "That's the learning part of MIT. It's not really about the exact things you study in class, the grade you get, or the amount of time you spend on psets, and especially not about how other people's academic lives are going. Freshman year you feel the imposter syndrome the most. Sophomore year, you feel burnt out from feeling like an imposter. Junior year you begin to notice how much you have grown. And senior year you realize what MIT was all about. It's all about the friends we made along the way. Jk But seriously, dw, you'll understand what I mean, just trust the process. It's these 4 years that you learn how to actually solve problems, and most importantly, you learn to find and define them.",

            "comment": "I got the dose early, some years before attending MIT as a grad student.\n\nI went to high school with a couple of world-class geniuses.   A classmate was later dubbed one of the most accomplished physicists of my generation by the New York Times.   Another classmate scored 99th percentile in the GRE -- as a high school sophomore who took the exam \"just for fun\".\n\nI remember being sent by my school to math &amp; physics competitions with them -- as a filler, mind you -- knowing the only reason I was there was because they didn't have enough people on the team.   One of them went on to become the first American ever to win the International Physics Olympiad, with the highest individual score.\n\nThe experience made me question myself.   E.g., I was very interested in physics, but being around them made think that I had nothing to contribute at all.  I decided not to become a physics major.\n\nOn the other had, the experience also forced me (in a good way) to find my own \"niche\".   For me it was CS.  I could never compete with them on math &amp; physics, but I could hold my own when it came to computers.\n\nIt made me appreciate that along any given dimension, there are many people out there who are (by far) smarter / more talented / more accomplished than me.   But if I try hard, I can find my own unique strengths and contribute in my own way.\n\nWith that mindset, at MIT for the most part I was very comfortable.  It was a blessing to be around classmates &amp; others who were all very accomplished.",

Learn to enjoy the feeling and be excited to learn every day, and from every one!",

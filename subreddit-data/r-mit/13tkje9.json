    "postText": "I am an incoming graduate student at MIT starting this fall. I have chosen Tang 24-B 3-BHK as my first-year residence. Understand it is on the topmost floor of the tower, so I am pretty excited about the view. I hope I can see Charles through our flat.\n\n1. Any recommendations or words of advice before I move to Tang? I am a little concerned after reading mixed reviews about the place here.\n2. How do I commute from Tang to MIT Sloan / Harvard Business School? Do I need to avail T or are there special buses running for students in the university area? Also, how do students travel when the weather gets really bad?\n\nThank you in advance! :)",

Remote from both Kendall and Central and BU stations. Maybe closer to the BU if you go south via the BU bridge. But the T ride is not worth the walk. Double the walking time you get to Harvard. The MIT area is very windy in the winter especially on the river. Get prepared for some wind blocker clothes and gloves if you are not from New England",

I used that for the first two years at MIT. But blue bikes are hard to find when and where the needs are high (rush hours, near dorms and major campus locations), it is often hard to find any bike, the quality of the bikes are also going down so I eventually got my own bike.",

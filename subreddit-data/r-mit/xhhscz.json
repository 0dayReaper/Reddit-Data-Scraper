            "comment": "all undergraduates must pass the swim test or take a swimming pe course to graduate. also, all undergraduates must have at least 8 pe credits to graduate. each pe course gives 2 pe credits, and undergraduates can register for one pe course per quarter. these credits do not count as standard course credits, meaning that they cannot be used for unrestricted elective credit, but they also do not apply to the credit limit freshmen are restricted by. varsity sports also give pe credit, but i\u2019m not sure how much (maybe 4 per season? don\u2019t quote me on that though).\n\nthe registration system for pe classes is, unlike the registration system for regular classes, fucking dumb. unlike the standard registration system, there is no pre-registration and no placement lottery. it is entirely on a first-come first-serve basis, meaning the servers the system is hosted on crash every single quarter at 8 am on the day registration opens. in order to get a popular class, you have to keep refreshing (further worsening the load on the server) and hope the page loads within the first 20 minutes or you\u2019re fucked for the quarter. this year, the server actually went down and didn\u2019t let *anyone* register courses, and it only came online an hour later. all of the most popular courses invariably fill within the first hour (i guess technically the second hour this year, but it was the first hour it was actually open), and if you wait until the next day the remaining options typically consist of wonderful classes like \u201cBootcamp: introduction\u201d and \u201cDiscovery: adventure and team building\u201d. the registration period is like a week btw, but that part doesn\u2019t matter.",

If you want to be cleared to take sailing as a PE, you are tested to see that you can tread water for 10 minutes.\n\nMany universities have a swim requirement for graduation; Harvard got theirs after a donor required it.  All will teach you how if necessary, all humans should be able to save themselves if they fall into water.",

Is it worth it to use a flex PNR on biology if I plan on going to gradschool, and what GPA should I even being aiming for? I feel like I may have already screwed myself.",

            "comment": "FWIW grad schools do like to see improvement over time in grades. Your final average GPA should be quite high but certainly doesn\u2019t need to be perfect. Your first year spring GPA barely matters at all (especially bc we\u2019re looking at two Bs, as opposed to something like all Cs/Ds). Your grades in key classes (which classes depends on the type of program you\u2019re interested in) are much more important than overall GPA.",

            "comment": "It completely depends on what field you're going to grad school for, and what degree (MEng, MSc, PhD, MD), and what schools. \n\nIdk how \"flex PNR\" works since that came after my time, but if you can use that for any class I wouldn't waste it on Bs in your first year. Save it for harder classes where you may get Cs or classes further down the road. Bs in your first year is absolutely not going to kill your chances of grad school. Grades in the following years and grades in your major classes will be more heavily considered than freshman year grades. \n\nAnecdotally, I got into a PhD program with many Bs and even Cs on my transcript for freshman &amp; sophomore year. I significantly improved my grades during the rest of undergrad after that. I believe the overall hit to my GPA is why I wasn't accepted to my top choice grad programs, but by no means does that make grad school impossible. I still got in other places and I'm doing fine. There are plenty of very good programs outside of top 10 institutions. \n\nThe idea that 2 Bs in freshman year would prevent someone from getting into any decent grad programs is ridiculous. You'll be fine. This won't even affect your chances at top schools for most fields if the rest of undergrad goes well for you.",

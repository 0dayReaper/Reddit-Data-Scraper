Was he perfect? No. But he was way better than RPI admin when I was at RPI and is orders of magnitude better than his MIT peers and replacement.",

            "comment": "I work in the MIT administration in a department, so pretty far down from him.  He'll be fine.  Don't expect a revolution of new ideas and changes, but do expect reasonable, data-driven, decision making.  Mistakes will be made, but he listens to the people around him and is good at choosing the right people for senior positions (mind you, I have some quibbles, but I'm generally positive).  He is well known for being approachable and listening to students and staff.  He is good at toning down unreasonable professors and promoting the voices of those with good ideas.  The President at a University is usually less hands-on as a leader, where the MIT Provost is definitely a day-to-day policy maker and director, so the role is different (depending on how they do things at RPI).  University Presidents are fundraisers and drivers of higher level matters like cross-institute collaborations and such.  So it's different from Marty's role has been at MIT, but I think we will do quite well at it.",

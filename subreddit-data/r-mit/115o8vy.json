            "comment": "It\u2019s not really a Computer Science degree; it\u2019s much more of a Science/Engineering degree. You\u2019re usually working in one of the affiliated departments (AeroAstro, MechE, Math, etc) and working on a problem relevant to that field which features a computational aspect.\n\nComputational Science a Computer Science are kind of two different worlds though; machine learning is a very broad topic that is featured in both, but make sure to choose well your advisor and the problem you\u2019ll be working on.",

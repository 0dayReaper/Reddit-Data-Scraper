On Park Drive, its a 5 minute walk to both the Comm Ave and Beacon Street T, comes with an AC unit. The apartment has a full kitchen, bathroom, and living room too. It\u2019s 1500$ a month + a small sublet fee + electricity which comes out to about 40$ a month. PM if you\u2019re interested I\u2019m open to answering all and any question about it!",

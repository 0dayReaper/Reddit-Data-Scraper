I am hoping to get into 14.73 (Challenge of World Poverty) next semester, which would also be a HASS-S CI-H. Anyway, you should just take a look at all of them in MIT course catalog. You will see that there are a bunch of them.",

The essay grading isn't easy, but it's fair and the class helps you out a lot with how they expect you to write.",

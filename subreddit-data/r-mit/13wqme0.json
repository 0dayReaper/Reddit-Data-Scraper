    "postText": "Hey! I wanted to apply for an FPOP because it seems like a really cool opportunity. I wanted to apply to the low income/first generation one because it would be very cheap but you have to rank a second and third choice as well. \n\nApparently there are financial aid opportunities to cover the cost (and they can be a little expensive for someone in my situation). I was wondering how much aid they provide, as I\u2019d be interested in putting programs like discover aerospace and discover math as second and third choices.",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI'm a recent adMIT, and I'm trying to get ahead on some of my classes for the upcoming fall freshman semester. Mostly, I just want to get a feel for MIT material.\n\nI'm particularly interesting in 6.190 (C and Assembly). When I go to their course website ([https://llp.mit.edu/6190/S23A](https://llp.mit.edu/6190/S23A)), it asks me to login. But when I login with my alumni account(\\*\\*\\*), I get an error message:\n\n[Error Message](https://preview.redd.it/uhgf6hy0wdta1.png?width=2212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=feffe6730633d2d5eaad4674aefeb8e8f0838bb3)\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n(1) How do you fix this error messages?  \n(2) Can all MIT students/alumni access course websites without ever haven taken the course?\n\nThanks for reading, have a nice day...and please reply!!!\n\n(\\*\\*\\*) For some reason, MIT already gave me an alumni email address, even though I'm yet to step foot on campus. Probably because I already committed.",

You cannot access MIT materials without your Kerberos being activated and you being enrolled into a class. Websites under CAT-SOOP (a good chunk of course 6) cannot be accessed without full enrollment. Also, just chill, there\u2019s no reason to be jumping in this early. You\u2019ll be hosed enough as is once MIT starts\u2014take this time to enjoy the world around you, not CS.",

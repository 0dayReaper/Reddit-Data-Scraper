I work in the admissions world so I can tell you that straight As aren't required to get you to a top grad school. Your projects, publications, and participation in the scholarly community carry more weight than a single grade.\n\nHowever, your asking the question could mean a couple of things:\n1- You have high standards for yourself. That is why you are where you are in the first place. \n2- You are carrying over some undergrad admission assumptions. Make sure you talk to your advisors and build a portfolio for grad school and for work beyond grades\n\nSorry if I made any wrong assumptions. Only good vibes and intentions here.. Good luck and don't forget to enjoy life. The summer is glorious where you are.",

But to answer your question about grad school - if you get enough b's it might shut you out of certain top tier grad schools for certain majors. So like, for example, if you get about half b's / half a's, that might shut you out of the #1 or #2 grad school for certain engineering disciplines. But it won't shut you out of getting into a grad school in general. And as far as job concerns, similar concept here. If you want to do some of the top management consulting firms or fintech jobs, GPA can really matter a lot (ex. McKinsey). The other thing it can shut you out of is med school, which tends to be pretty stringent on GPA. But basically anything else, you're fine. Most ppl who are really stressing over GPA at MIT are going after one of the very specific paths I just mentioned. I got about half A's half B's in Course 10 and got into grad schools in the top 10 for ChemE, ended up going to one in the top 20 bc I wanted a more relaxed experience. Similar story for grad school GPA and had no trouble landing a first job at a major company.",

    "postText": "I am interested in coming to MIT for the EECS PhD. I am concerned about whether or not most students graduate and how common it is for students to quit and drop out. I am passionate about my research and want to finish my PhD with a strong body of work, but I am worried MIT is a \"sink or swim\" place and that maybe it is too competitive or difficult to be successful in such a strong environment. Are people generally more collaborative or competitive?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

If you are committed to graduating, and \n3. there are no unforeseen personal circumstances that draw you down.\n\nI assure you that you will graduate. People will help you and support you. MIT DNA is far more collaborative than you'd imagine from the outside. People are humble and will lend you a hand if you ask for it.  \n\n\nAbout being successful, that's relative and depends on how you define it. There are exceptionally bright people here. But I view that as an asset and not a thing to worry about.",

            "comment": "It's depends on what you want to research but in general the people I saw succeed with a good body of work were people who came in with a good body of work and worked in the same field.  Even then nothing was guaranteed. \nCalling it a strong environment is maybe the wrong way to think about it. Variable or disorganized maybe? It's not hard or competitive because it's designed that way by the department. For some people it's the worst hell on earth and for some it's true bliss and they never want to leave. Totally depends on when you're there and who you're with.",

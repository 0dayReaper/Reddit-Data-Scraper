What experiences and opportunities did you have that are unique to MIT?\n3. How has MIT helped you achieve your goals? How has it influenced your career?\n4. How have the connections you gained at MIT helped you after graduating?\n5. How have you used what you learned from MIT? Was your experience at MIT worth your time?\n6.

    "postText": "Okay I am an alum. I had a wonderful time at MIT. Classes were hard but I made it through. I made life long friends and was involved with many activities and did a sport. My husband is also and alum - same story for him.\n\nNow we have a HS student starting the college search process. We know getting in to MIT is extremely hard with so many qualified kids applying. I am trying really hard to not make him fall in love with the place (or any of the most selective schools)\n\nBut today MIT send my kid a quirky email (mass email of course) but the topic was so on point that it is ok to do something for self care like build furniture rather than all the HS stuff you need to do. I had just finished nagging him about doing his homework in the free hour between school and his EC and not working on his hobby project.",

            "comment": "Maybe try to refocus from \"selling MIT\" to \"selling studying engineering\". Plenty of other schools have similar cultures - they're smaller, but you make of them whatever you put in. The only reason MIT has the culture it does is because it selects students who they think will create that culture, but of course there are just as many students MIT turns away who would be fantastic MIT students, and they end up elsewhere. You just need to find them.",

HMC should definitely go on your list \u2013 it's a smaller school (~1K students) without a graduate program, so the professors (a) actually care about teaching undergrads and (b) offer significant research opportunities.\n\n(The good weather is a nice bonus, too)",

We all felt we were the mistake that slipped through the admissions process. \nAs a parent I think it is more important to teach the kid grit, and to help them discover their passion(s). If that combination leads them to MIT because the parents went there, sure, that\u2019s nice. But if that leads them to Juliard, starting a company, going into service, or simply leading a fulfilling life, then that\u2019s great.",

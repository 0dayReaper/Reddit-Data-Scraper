    "postText": "Later today I'll be interviewing for a summer job that will put me at MIT with provided housing. The company in question usually works with universities so it'll put its employees up in university housing (mainly dorms). I've never been to MIT before, so I was wondering what they're like. I know dorm perception changes when you're a freshman living there for the first time and when you're an upperclassman who's finally been able to get their own place, so I'd love to hear from some upperclassman what their opinions on the dorms are!",

I've found it more common than my kids at other universities, who were moving out by junior year latest.\n\nDorms are empty ish too. This is also a comparison to my kids other universities, but not a lot of people seem to stick around for summer classes at MIT.\n\nDorms are dorms. Not awful but not great. I guess the worst thing for someone not accustomed to it would be the shared bathrooms.\n\nOh god ya know what? They're f* hot. Many have NO AIR CONDITIONING and it's BRUTAL and UGLY.\n\ndude, ask about that. I wouldn't even let my kid stay there over the summer based on what I saw when we moved them in last august. Brutal.",

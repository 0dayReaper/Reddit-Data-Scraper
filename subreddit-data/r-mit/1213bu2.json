It doesn't matter how talented or hardworking you are, your advisor will give you self-contradictory instructions. You will be told it's your fault. You will be chastised for making decisions as well as for inaction. You will be told it's your fault. You will be isolated. You will be told it's your fault. Your ideas will get ripped off. You will be told it's your fault. You will learn to love it.\n\nMIT is an abusive relationship.",

Many people can thrive at MIT, but it's a matter of taking the necessary steps to prepare yourself for it.\n\nI would recommend at least consulting with a therapist, OP. I don't intend this to sound like judgment, but, similar to my scenario, you may have found yourself in over your head partially due to how you've responded to particular challenges rather than the challenges themselves.",

But, maybe contrary to your advice, I'm finally starting to blame myself less. It seems like a lot of it is down to the environment. Among other things, there's definitely a messed up \"git gut n00b\" attitude that you can see, for example, in some of the other comments on this post.\n\nI think this might also be largely a grad-school-centric post. It's not inspired by falling behind on classes, that's for sure. Maybe the posters here are mostly undergrads.",

I looked into hotels but I'm new here and kinda concerned about solo travelling there by myself, so it would be great if I had a safe option on campus and didn't have to uber back and forth every day. So if this is allowed and anyone wants to let me crash at their place for 3 nights I'd be down to pay you 300 bucks :P lmk! (I'm 19m btw, no allergies or anything) thanks",

Hotels heading towards Harvard Square are a bit more of a walk, although you can also easily use the Red Line of the MBTA (though we used to say \"should we walk or do we have time to take the T?\").\n\nYou might possibly find an Airbnb in that's an easy walk to campus too.\n\nThat said I have no idea how expensive they are these days or how safe the area feels today. Before the pandemic it was pretty safe, but I'm out of touch on its current state. And I definitely get concerns about solo traveling. I hope you can find a good host, that sounds optimal.",

The thing is I'm arriving on Friday and leaving Monday morning so my stay would be 3 nights, and hotels in Kendall Square for that duration will go well beyond my budget. There are cheaper options further away but tbh I'd be fine sleeping on a futon in some random dorm. I sound like a wimp saying this but this will kinda be my first time travelling by myself, in a place I'm not completely familiar with yet, so having the option to be within campus for the whole thing would alleviate a lot of the stress for me. Plus it'd be cool to get to know some MIT guys :P",

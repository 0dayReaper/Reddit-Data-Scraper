    "postText": "Hi everyone, was wondering if there are any fellow motorcycle riders at MIT that have had to navigate parking? I\u2019ll be living in Westgate Hall this fall for my masters. I don\u2019t mind parking my motorcycle in a parking garage \u2014 does MIT have any that are close to Westgate? What about riding to classes/campus buildings? Do you usually leave your motorcycle in standard Cambridge parking or do you park someplace more secluded on campus (e.g., near a bike rack). What are the rules about that? Thanks in advance!",

There is a shuttle service from that side of campus that comes pretty regularly (never had to wait more than ten minutes when it was really cold). The MIT mobile app has all of the shuttles and up to date arrival times. If you\u2019re just trying to get into the main campus, I think the tech shuttle would be your best bet.",

It appears that there is a garage quite close to Westgate, as well as the Westgate lot. The campus resident parking rate is $174/month.\nGiven how limited parking is, I can't imagine it would be more convenient to drive to class, as the farthest walk between most campus buildings is only about a mile, and the tech shuttle exists as well.\nI've never actually looked at the rules on this, but I'm absolutely certain you can't park a motorcycle at a bike rack; you have to park it like any other motor vehicle.",

You do not need a specific motorcycle permit. You can register up to three vehicles (including motorcycles) on your parking account; just use the \u201c+ another vehicle\u201d function on your parking dashboard to add a motorcycle. However, note that only one vehicle at a time may park on campus under each permit. \n\n&gt; You can park a motorcycle in any lot within your designated parking area. Please utilize existing motorcycle spaces if available. Note that motorcycles should not be parked in any campus garages due to safety concerns associated with the ramps and decks. Motorcycles also should not be parked at campus bicycle racks.\n\n&gt; If you are an MIT campus resident (employee or student), you can only register one vehicle at a time on your parking account. Please see the FAQ below (Number of vehicles) about how to switch between your car and your motorcycle.",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm an incoming prefrosh. To preface, I don't really know much about how the internship / research position application process works in college / at MIT in particular.  I was wondering 1) how common it is for freshmen at MIT to do a UROP / internship the summer after their first year, 2) when the \"application season\" for internships is, 3) whether there's a general timeframe over which these internships tend to last (or is it usually the entire summer?), and 4) whether \"legit\" / popular summer internships are necessarily in-person.\n\nThanks for the help!",

            "comment": "1) It's very common to do **something** your freshman year, but don't feel like you're a failure if you don't. Plenty of people chill at home or do something \"non-glamourous\"\nYour options are, generally: internship, UROP, sports, summer program TA. And these are stackable (my good friend did a UROP &amp; was a summer program TA)\n\n2) There's basically two application seasons: for upperclassmen and one for underclassmen, though there's good intersect. The fall career fairs are generally geared to juniors/seniors so still go! it's amazing way to network and basically practice for underclassmen season, just don't feel bad if you don't get any fruits from your labor. The spring career fairs are gonna be more geared towards the last of the upperclassmen and also lots more internships. \n\nAlso other great ways to network is to be part of a club, engineering team, be a part of your major's mailing list, and just observe the flyers as you walk down the infinite!\n\n3) It's usually the entire summer but you can of course negotiate start &amp; end times to give yourself a few weeks before and/or after to be with family/friends. It's very common to delay your start date.\n\n4) Whats \"legit\" or \"popular\" mean to you? If you mean the big tech stuff... at least before covid they were all in person but now it's probably going to be one of the first things they clarify as you talk to a recruiter.\n\nOverall don't stress too much, ask your freshman advisor and upperclassmen friends! And don't treat UROPs as an afterthought when it comes to the summer: their applications are just as hard &amp; timely as internship applications.\n\nEDIT: Also MISTI! Not sure how it works post-covid, but it's super fun!\n\nAlso you can use IAP to join a competition class (like the poker challenge) to network, and you can do hack-a-thons to networks as well. Or you can even do an internship or UROP over IAP that'll set you up for a summer internship!",

                    "comment": "What a perfect answer. The only thing I\u2019d add on the timeline is that it does vary a little by field. Application season for CS/meche tends to be in the fall (and there are freshmen that find internships at fall career fair, but definitely don\u2019t feel bad if you don\u2019t because like they said it\u2019s geared to upperclassmen). On the other hand, biotech internship season tends to be early in spring semester. I know course 20 has their own biotech career fair in late winter/early spring for that reason. I\u2019m not sure about some of the other fields, but it might be a good idea to discuss with someone in that area\n\nAlso - personally I did MISTI my freshman summer and would highly recommend it (I went to Chile but there are a ton of different countries available)\n\nAlso, this is off-topic but you should definitely check out tour de shass when they have it at the beginning of the school year. I feel like it\u2019s not advertised enough and it\u2019s really cool. Basically all the SHASS departments set up booths and give out thematic items and discuss their offerings for the upcoming year. There\u2019s also usually free lunch",

                    "comment": "I totally agree with all of this. Just to add on, I've found that IAP micro internships often have a lower barrier for entry (ofc depending on the company) because it's only a month long and it can easily lead to a summer internship offer. Also, the spring has Spring Career Fair and Xfair which I agree are definitely more approachable as a freshman (I got my freshman internship at Xfair). There used to be a program called FASIP which was the freshman alumni summer internship program but unfortunately I believe it ended a few years ago. It was run by CAPD and I believe they still have freshman-geared events and workshops and I would definitely recommend those for preparing for interviews and creating/polishing your resume. Best of luck and definitely no pressure to have an internship freshman summer as others have said but if you are motivated to find one, it is definitely possible.",

            "comment": "I think it\u2019s pretty common to do a UROP pretty much any time after the first fall semester. So just make sure to make the deadlines to apply for a UROP on the UROP website. In terms of internships, those can pretty much happen whenever but summer internships are common and pretty available in Boston. In terms of length a lot of the ones I\u2019ve read in my field of interest have been ~10 weeks but I\u2019m sure it varies. Good luck :)",

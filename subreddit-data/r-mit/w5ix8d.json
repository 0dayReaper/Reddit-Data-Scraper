    "postText": "I was taking the 6.002.1 (Circuit analysis) course by Prof. Anant Agrawal on edX when it came to my surprise that the homework and lab is only available to those who have paid for the course.\n\nPeople who want the certificate pay for the course usually, I just wanted the knowledge, so I checked OpenCourseWare for it. \n\nTo my delight, it was there. With assignments! The issues is that there are no solution pdfs to the assignments and labs. What should I do?",

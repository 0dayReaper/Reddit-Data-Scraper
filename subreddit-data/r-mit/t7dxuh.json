            "comment": "For. I\u2019m one of those fellowship holders who was told to get bent by MIT when I brought up the fact that they were violating the terms of my fellowship. Essentially they make me work a second RA to cover a tuition shortfall when the terms of the fellowship prohibit that. They\u2019re supposed to waive the difference. While mine is funded by a different federal agency, they were doing this to NSF fellows too and the NSF Inspector General just last week told MIT to stop. You can check that out here: \n\nhttps://oig.nsf.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2022-03/22-6-001-MIT-Routine-Activity-GRFPredacted.pdf\n\nTo me, this just goes to show that we need a stronger base of power to push back against the Institute. Thankfully, by forcing me to work an RA, I get to vote in the election, even after the Institute forced the fellows to be cut from the bargaining unit!\n\nAnother thing that I\u2019d like to see change is the charging of full tuition after classes are done as a PhD candidate. I was previously a grad student elsewhere and I know students around the country. It is extremely rare for a school to do that and I\u2019d estimate that MIT is pulling in over $50 million per year from us from this policy. If they need to charge us some overhead, fine, but $60K per year for practically nothing in exchange is unacceptable. Not to mention that by reducing our costs, we would likely graduate sooner, since we\u2019d by less likely to need to work second RAs or TAs in our last year or two.\n\nIn a similar vein, how about them tearing down the most affordable grad housing on campus and replacing it with the most expensive? Nice one, MIT. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re making a tidy profit off that.\n\nOther things I\u2019d like to see change: Yeah, the dental would be nice. While not talked about by the GSU folks, the Harvard contract makes the school help pay for conference travel directly, rather than on reimbursement. I think that would make conference travel more financially comfortable for students.\n\nI don\u2019t expect us to necessarily win all of the victories we desire in the first contract. But I\u2019m tired of being powerless against what I see as abuses by the Institute.",

The way MIT historically structured things for NSF GRFP recipients exposed them to huge tax liabilities and complications, which the Institute did extraordinarily little to allay. I know several people who went through lengthy (read: multi year) processes with lawyers and the IRS to resolve these issues. Expensive wastes of time for individuals who are really making near poverty wages when you factor in cost of housing in Cambridge.\n\nKudos to the NSF for calling this out.",

For that alone we deserve to have a say in our own working conditions, and grad unions at other universities things have won things like dental insurance, increased benefits for grads with families, protections against harassment, and cost of living adjustments. Those are all things I want but I\u2019m not gonna get them unless we have real bargaining power.\n\nWhile the admin has listened to *some* suggestions in recent years, that is basically just by chance, and they are not structurally obligated to meet our needs or even listen to our concerns. Especially with a new administration coming around the corner, we need to secure a seat at the table or who knows what will happen. It\u2019s just\u2026smart and responsible to ensure our needs are heard and met.\n\nThe only objection I could really see is that the UE is not \u201cus\u201d somehow. But the GSU is not a shady third party coming in to mess things up (which is how the admin has been painting it) but literally a bunch of dedicated MIT grad workers who are tired of being treated like we should be grateful to be here. Think of the \u201cnational\u201d UE as like a protocol that groups can follow when they want to organize to take back some of the power that their employers currently deny them. \n\nOn that note I have to say I am pushed even more toward voting Yes after reading the scare tactic Union busting emails the administration has sent out\u2014they are trying to exclude a lot of workers from voting (and then blaming it somehow on the GSU?) by pretending like the work they do doesn\u2019t contribute anything of value back to the institute which is\u2026frankly insulting and obviously inaccurate.\n\nFrom the end of child labor to the 2 day weekend\u2026unions are on the right side of history! That\u2019s why so many tech workers are unionizing right now (most recently at The NY Times). They know it\u2019s good for them and so should we!",

Without a union to put actual pressure on MIT, the administration has no reason to provide anything beyond the bare minimum they think they can get away with. They know that MIT's reputation will always lure in a lot of well-qualified graduate applicants and that once they're here, it's extremely difficult to transfer somewhere else. So unless graduate students --especially those who don't have parents supporting them or those who have a family of their own-- want to start quitting en masse or drown in rising living costs, I don't see any other option but to start a union and negotiate for the conditions they deserve. (Disclaimer: not a grad student)",

There's a reason why so many of the current and former leadership of the Grad Student Council--and other advocacy channels--are organizing for and supporting the GSU: they have witnessed firsthand just how hard it is to get the MIT admin to actually listen to the concerns of grad students and enact meaningful change. ([This op-ed](https://thetech.com/2021/11/15/graduate-student-leaders-gsu) does a pretty good job explaining the inherent power imbalance and structural obstacles of securing change through existing advocacy channels) \n\nA union is the only way to legally get that power to sit down and negotiate with admin to enact some long overdue changes for grad workers.",

            "comment": "For! As an undergrad at MIT, I was involved in student government and the administrators I met with basically dismissed all student concerns and constantly talked over me in meetings. \n\nOne summer, we were negotiating over changes to a dorm policy, and I would send them the text of the latest change, there would be radio silence for 4 weeks, and then I would get feedback to completely rewrite the policy in the next 24 hours to meet new requirements that we hadn't agreed on (or else the administration would just change it to exactly what they wanted). This gave me no time to consult the students I nominally represented, who were scattered across the world and mostly working full-time over the summer. I was also working full-time and in a different time zone from MIT. Predictably, this was a complete shit show and admin got exactly what they wanted in the end, pissing off most of the residents of my dorm. I ended up quitting student government because I felt like I had wasted my life getting jerked around by admin, and had achieved nothing other than making other people in my dorm mad at me.\n\nThis experience really soured me on the power of student government on MIT -- MIT claims to value student perspectives, but consistently ignores student recommendations (see the lack of kitchens in New Vassar, the removal of mutual selection during floor rush in undergrad dorms, the Eastgate closure, and so on). \n\nAs a grad student, I started talking to people in the union and learned that (unsurprisingly) student government at the grad level deals with the exact same issues I dealt with as an undergrad: [https://thetech.com/2021/11/15/graduate-student-leaders-gsu](https://thetech.com/2021/11/15/graduate-student-leaders-gsu) . The Tech article says it best, but basically MIT often simply ignores GSC recommendations on stipends + housing, and BGSA recommendations on DEI, and so on. If you want to learn more about the issues discussed here, feel free to email any of the co-authors of the article -- they're all great people who can answer questions about their experiences in detail.\n\nWith a union, MIT is legally required to negotiate on certain issues related to stipends, benefits, and working conditions. Student workers will have an actual voice on these issues, and MIT will have to take our demands seriously. I believe this will change my life for the better, and will change other grad student workers' lives for the better. \n\nAnd for the record, I do think grad students are workers.  My lab has 1 PI, 2 postdocs, and 30+ grad students. So, which group is doing the majority of the research? Most classes in my department have multiple grad TAs. So, who's writing the psets, teaching the recitations and doing all the grading? Without grad students, MIT's research output would slow to a trickle, and classes would need to be radically restructured (or hire a ton of undergrad TAs I guess?). MIT works because we do, and we deserve a real say in our working conditions and compensation.\n\nI am excited to vote yes and I encourage others to do so as well!",

            "comment": "Undecided. I do think it's a little silly to act like grad students are \"workers\" in the same way that plumbers and electricians are. Grad students can take a week off whenever they want at a drop of a hat. Grad students miss deadlines all the time. Grad students can make big dumb mistakes and everyone overlooks it because \"it's a learning experience\". If someone was directly paying me to do the work I do, and I delivered the quality I've been delivering... I'd expect to be fired. But it's okay because I'm a student, and not a worker.\n\nI'm concerned about a lot of the promises the union is making. For example they're digging in on getting us dental coverage. Why should I assume the union will give us that? What real efforts have been put forth in the past, which didn't work and thus necessitate a union as the solution? And how should I believe that the union will act in my interests, rather than the interests of a couple dozen students who end up calling the shots (because very few people will actually have the time to engage directly with things like that).\n\nIf the dues come out to $600 per student per year (a number I've heard thrown around - correct me if I'm wrong), then the 7300 MIT grad students will bring in over $4 million every single year in dues. Where is that money going? 4 million dollars is an absolute fuckton and it would be nice to see a preliminary budget showing what my money is being spent on and how it's directly benefiting us. I haven't seen a lot of direct numbers and data from the union to convince me it's a good idea - only a ton of vague promises that feel like someone running for president. Overall, I'd love to see an actionable list of \"what the union wants to achieve in its first year\" so that, after a year, we can evaluate whether it's really doing what it set out to do. Unions are great, and I support the idea of them, but I fear that this particular union being proposed may not actually deliver a benefit which is commensurate with its cost.\n\nI also really don't feel great about how they said \"We're affiliated with UE. Take it or leave it\" and that's the only choice, rather than having... ANY transparency and allowing the students who are being represented to have a say in what direction we go with any potential union.\n\nIt's really annoying how everyone has an agenda. The MIT administration acts like the union is a useless waste of time that will make everything worse. The GSU members act like the union is a gift directly from god that will fix everything bad in the world. The reality is that it's a thing that has pros and cons. And I wish I could see the GSU lay out the cons in an honest fashion and say \"But despite those cons, we believe this is worth it\" rather than everything I've seen that brushes the cons under the rug and pretends they don't exist.",

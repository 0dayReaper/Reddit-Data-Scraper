    "postText": "Housing applications aren't out yet, but I've been thinking about how I'll rank dorms on the form and can't decide how to rank my top three dorms.\n\nRight now I'm between New House numbered houses, New Vassar, and Simmons (thinking of ranking them in that order). I was wondering if anyone could compare the cultures between these three dorms or had advice/experience with these dorms that they'd be able to share?\n\nAdditional info:\n\n\\- I really want newer facilities\n\n\\- Suite style seems cool; more private bathrooms like Simmons has\n\n\\- Don't want to live in a triple\n\n\\- I'd probably want some form of a small meal plan no matter where I lived? It seems like it'd be really time consuming to go grocery shopping/cook every day?\n\n\\- I love the design of Simmons (all of the windows oml) but I'm not sure I'd vibe with the culture- it's Harry Potter themed and I liked that series but idk about living somewhere built around that\n\n\\- Want a middle ground between the more athletic/party dorms (baker as far as I can tell) and the more counterculture/very nerdy/socially awkward vibes that East Campus/Random/Next House? kind of gave me\n\nSome of my assumptions about these dorms and others may be totally wrong- please add in any of your own experiences or advice!",

            "comment": "Meal plan: Overall I don't really know much about New House, but I believe most cook-for-yourself communities have a system where a smaller group of people cook for the larger group (at least for dinner), so you don't have to cook for yourself every night. YMMV though depending on the dorm and floor. Also, if you don't live in a dining hall dorm, you can still sign up for a voluntary meal plan, although they're smaller than the mandatory ones. Additionally, the mandatory meal plan for frosh is now 225 (?) meals per semester, which is really far more than anyone actually uses. \n\nNewer facilities: basically any of the Tier 1 housing will probably suit you. But if you're married to the idea of brand new, New Vassar was opened 2 years ago, Burton Connor will have just reopened after renovation, and New House was renovated in 2018. New Vassar and New House definitely have air conditioning; I don't know if Burton Connor had it installed.\n\nSuite style: I only really know Simmons, where you share a bathroom with a maximum of 3 other people. There are some actual suites, but most of the clusters are open to the hallway. I think all other dorms have communal bathrooms, but I may be wrong.\n\nRoom size: if you want to avoid triples/quads, you should probably avoid the dorms that have quads at all (Maseeh, Baker). 4 dorms have up to triples (Burton Connor, McCormick, Next, Simmons), and I don't think it's super hard to get a double as a frosh in Simmons, although it depends on how the upperclassmen chose. I have no idea for the other dorms. If you want to 100% avoid a triple, East Campus, MacGregor, New House, New Vassar, and Random all only have singles and doubles. \n\nSimmons design: the Harry Potter elements are from our previous heads of house. There's not actually a lot of elements. Also, be advised that if you wanted any kind of air conditioning, built in or in-window, Simmons' windows cannot accommodate in-window air conditioners. Frankly, air conditioning isn't really all that crucial because it's only desirable for maybe a couple weeks of each term. Also also, if you want the built-in friends that floor culture provides, Simmons may not be for you.\n\nVibes: You are correct that Baker is broadly considered the athletic dorm (I believe there are also a number of frat/sorority frosh there that leave once they can move into the houses). Next House shouldn't necessarily be lumped in with EC and Random. The most 'counterculture' dorms are East Campus, Random, and Burton Connor (before renovation; it will probably remain there, but time will tell). There's then a pretty large gap between them and Simmons/Next, which are probably the most 'alt' of the West Campus dorms (excluding BC of course). Also, Burton Connor and East Campus probably have the most famous parties on campus, as evidenced by the fact that I know about them and not any of other dorms I don't live in. Also also, New Vassar doesn't have a strongly established culture yet as far as I know.\n\nAll that being said, Resident Exploration is a thing that exists, where you can get to know the dorms better and (attempt) to change dorm assignments, so don't worry too much about getting a perfect fit first try.",

                            "comment": "Depends highly on the living group, but I'd say certain floors in Burton-Conner + entries in Macgregor are fairly similar to some of the numbered houses in New, in terms of having a cook-for-yourself community (although plenty of people are on the smallest meal plan), chill vibe, and generally being sort of a cultural middle ground between Baker/Maseeh/New Vassar and EC/Random.  \n\nBut Burton-Conner culture may end up changing a lot with the renovations, idk. Also Macgregor facilities aren't very nice and some of the entries are kind of quiet/dead.\n\nAnother thing to consider -- both BC and Macgregor have a ton of variation from living group to living group, whereas some other dorms (cough cough Baker/Maseeh) are pretty homogenous. Burton 3rd and Burton 2 do not have a lot in common culturally. Neither do A entry and J entry in Macgregor. So if you're assigned to either building, make sure to take floor rush seriously to try to find the floor/entry that best suits you.",

So frontload your preferences with dorms that people want to get into, so that if/when you want to switch, you'll have an easier time switching to the dorm you like (since other people will be vying for your spot).\n\nIn general, the dorms people want to get into are: Simmons, MacG, BC, New House \n\nAnd the dorms where if you're put into, you have a honestly &lt;20% chance of being able to leave it: New Vassar, Next, Mccormick, Random\n\nSo rank desirable dorms high and then make your final dorm decision when you're on campus and much more informed! And above all, don't agonize the decision much: you'll be able to find what you're looking for in any dorm.",

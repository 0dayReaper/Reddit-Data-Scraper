    "postText": "Hi all :) During the summer I bought 2 GA standing room only tickets to see Jack Harlow on the day of 10/10/22 but can\u2019t go anymore. It will be at the new MGM music hall in Fenway! I\u2019m selling them both for $90 each! This is the current asking price and you won\u2019t have to worry about paying any extra fees. If you\u2019re interested feel free to message me and I can transfer them through ticketmaster!",

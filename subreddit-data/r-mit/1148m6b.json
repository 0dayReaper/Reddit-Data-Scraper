[This is the project referenced in the image](https://www.attentivu.com/headband-and-scarf), but as you can tell from the project\u2019s [timeline](https://www.attentivu.com/history), this was actually an early prototype NOT developed in 2023 (2019 actually), and they\u2019ve moved away from the productivity part since. When I was part of the project, we were looking into much more positive use cases: [helping immobilized/paralyzed patients communicate with their caretakers](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/brain-switch/overview/).",

But I doubt they\u2019d make it even more absurd and do what the other Reddit post claims (I don\u2019t remember seeing any of that in internal ML updates and it doesn\u2019t seem to appear on the attentivu site\u2026)",

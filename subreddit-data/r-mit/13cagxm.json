    "postText": "Saw that someone made a thread last year. I figured that with the housing selection being the same spectacle it was last year, people might still have some issues or uncertainty with housing situations.\n\nSo I figured I might as well make a thread for this year where people can discuss housing search, roommate search, swaps, etc.\n\nI\u2019ll start: Tried to select with a roommate but we weren\u2019t able to get something together. I got an Ashdown room and he got a SidPac room in a 2br. Is anyone in SidPac looking to swap?",

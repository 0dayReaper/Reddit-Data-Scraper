    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI would like to know the overdue fines at MIT libraries. On their website, they say:\n\nWe do not charge standard overdue fines.\nWe do charge fines for:\nOverdue reserves \u2013 $2/hour\nLong overdue/lost (30+ days past the due date) \u2013 $15 processing fee + $135 replacement fee. All replacement fines and fees are credited when the item is returned.\n\nI have a book due on 1/3. (I am out of town so asking my friend to return it now.) Based on the information above, I will not be charged if I return it before 2/3. Is that correct?\n\n(I ask this because in the notification email I received, it said that replacement fees will be credited to your account when overdue items are returned, without memtioning any 30 days rule as above, so I am not sure what is the real situation.)\n\nThanks!",

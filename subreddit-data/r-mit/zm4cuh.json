Bike shops typically can help with mechanical issues such as tire swaps, brake pads, brake lines, etc...   \n\n\nHowever, anything to do with the battery/electronics will most likely only be dealt with by whomever made the electric scooter. Try reaching to their Customer Support or Social media pages. Hope you get back to riding soon, don't forget your helmet!",

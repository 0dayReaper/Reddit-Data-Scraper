    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m not able to find much information on the Masters of Science (SM) degree for EECS other than the fact that Doctoral students finish it before completing their PhD. If there is a source for more information on this degree, I\u2019d appreciate it, but if not, I have a few questions to those that know anything about the degree.\n\n1.) Are non EECS undergrads allowed to apply? (Directly to the degree, not to PhD)\n\n2. If it can be directly applied to, is it a 1 year or 2 year degree?\n\n3. Is this a terminal degree?\n\nThank for the help!",

PhD students tend to complete their SMs after their second year, but it varies by student and advisor.\n\nedit: relevant links:\n\nhttps://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/graduate-programs/degree-programs/\n\nand\n\nhttps://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/graduate-programs/graduate-program-requirements/\n\n(apologies for any typos, on mobile)",

LGO allows for a MS and MBA concurrently, SDM and IDM allow you to add on an additional masters degree without applying to MIT again. There may be other departments that offer this option (TPP perhaps?)",

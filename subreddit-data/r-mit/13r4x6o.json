    "postText": "I've so thankfully been given the chance of a lifetime here, and have commited to grad school at MIT starting this Fall.\n\nHowever, I've been dealing with some very recurrent and serious mental issues this past year from a stressful junior/senior year, and am worried cause my progress with getting better has been slower than I hoped. (I am on meds and have been working with my doc to lower the dose and get off them, but I'm unfortunately not coping well).\n\nI'm an incoming international student, so I'm expecting some stress from the big environmental change, on top of the heavy semestral load. \n\nI was hoping to ask if anyone else perhaps had similar experiences, and if there's anything I could do to help myself ease this anxiety.\n\nThanks so much in advance!",

Read these materials and connect with these people https://mitgsu.org/\n\n(Don\u2019t mention to ANY faculty, administrators, or staff that you have read these materials or even know what a union is before you are integrated into the campus). The culture at mit is to be politically and ethically agnostic, and in some ways to not have a personal life. \n\nIf you can arrange for supplementary mental health care off campus, do so. MIT mental health is there in part to protect MIT from liability. It\u2019s helps to have connections outside campus as a counterbalance to the odd culture within MIT. \n\nYour first priority should be to establish a self care routine now before you get there that can sustain you. Second, when there find supportive community. Third, remember you are there to build a career and you have already proven your worth, so network but don\u2019t bother competing or comparing yourself to others. \n\nThe degree is worth it, but I wish someone had told me this advice so I\u2019m telling you.",

But I\u2019d advise people to also be doing everything they can to manage your stress, like take the needlessly intense culture with a grain of salt, schedule reasonable working hours and conditions, and build peer connections as well.

It\u2019s not going to happen in a few months, unfortunately, and all those weird tricks don\u2019t do much. Stuff like exercise and meds and therapy, when done consistently, actually work eventually.\n\n\nLike other people are saying, step 1 is finding a therapist you click with. It might take a while, but it will be very much worth it. It\u2019s a good idea to start looking as soon as you get to campus (and maybe even before then). Psychology Today is a good way to find therapists, as is the website for your health insurance (it has a list of local providers who take the insurance). \n\n\nAlso, please stay on your meds. You don\u2019t need to taper off of them right now, and they can help you stay more stable as you work on yourself long-term in therapy. If they have side effects you can\u2019t tolerate, get different meds. There are many combinations and dosages out there, so you don\u2019t have to suffer on a medication regimen that\u2019s making you miserable.\n\n\nI don\u2019t necessarily 100% agree that MIT Mental Health is just there to prevent liability. I\u2019ve had many clinicians there who genuinely cared and were incredibly helpful. However, it\u2019s up to you whether you want to get a therapist and psychiatrist through MIT Mental Health or on your own. If you do go to MIT Mental Health, I recommend Dr. Debowy as a psychiatrist and Maria Minkova as a therapist (she\u2019s also an immigrant to the US, which may be helpful for you in particular, OP). If you decide to look for someone off campus, I recommend Sanda Aung as a psychiatrist. She\u2019s a very no-nonsense provider with a ton of experience. \n\n\nAlso, be prudent about your workload and set boundaries about working hours early on. If you\u2019re coming from undergrad right into grad school, you\u2019ve presumably spent the vast majority of your life in school and are pretty good at it. Grad school is exhausting, and I recommend finding sources of self-worth and joy that are not \u201cbeing really good at school.\u201d School will not love you back, but a hobby or solid friend group or pet will. You will need that to fall back on when things get crappy. \n\n\nPlease keep reaching out for help and advice. This stuff is tough, and it takes a lot of work, but I promise that getting better is worth it.",

You'll be sitting in class, listening to the other students, thinking \"damn, all these people are way smarter than me.\" \n\nAnd you might be right! That's OK. Try to revel in that! Every day I get to hang out with some of the smartest engineers on earth. They're my friends, climbing partners, and drinking buddies, and their 9-5 is solving world hunger. \n\nIn undergrad you work a subject for about 4 months and move on, occasionally revisiting it in a later subject. As you begin your research and take higher level classes that really build on undergraduate material, \"mastering the material\" becomes closer to a reality. \n\nIgnore what the other person said about mental health services. They're awesome and actually adequately staffed. The basic level health insurance means you can go once per week and not pay a dime. I've got an appointment today \ud83e\udd19",

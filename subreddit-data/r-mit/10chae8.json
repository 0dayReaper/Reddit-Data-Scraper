But before those start, what does a physics major take? Physics I and II? My college had courses analogous to that, but we also had courses on calculus and linear algebra. I understand 18.02 teaches calculus. But what about linear algebra? How does a physics student learn all the required mathematics? \n\nIs that all there is to it and is there something else? I am asking because I am trying to learn from OCW, and till now I haven't given much attention to my education even though I am a junior. ",

So for the MIT class at least, 18.02 and 18.03 are pretty much all you need. But I'd recommend taking some sort of linear algebra class to get a deeper understanding.\n\nPersonally, I took 18.701 and 18.702 which form the undergrad algebra sequence, which covers a lot more than linear algebra (stuff like groups, rings, fields, Galois theory) and I found that to be very helpful. It is on the theoretical side and assumes some experience with proofs, while classes like 18.06 (linear algebra) are more computational.\n\nI will say, the MIT undergrad physics curriculum prepared me very well for grad school. The first year required grad courses were a breeze.",

I didn't take 8.06 but I think it covers some of the more computational material like LU factorization, singular value decomposition, etc. 18.701 doesn't actually spend that much time on linear algebra specifically, as it's a group theory course, and what it does cover is not as focused on computation. It is overall a pretty useful course for physicists, though one that I would not recommend until you have some experience with proofs.\n\nThere is also another course, 18.700, which is a mathematically rigorous treatment of linear algebra. I think it uses Axler's book Linear Algebra Done Right. I am not sure if it covers the more computational parts of 18.06.",

We just passed out of high school, and mathematics isn't broken down into calc, trig etc, so we had to take the whole thing. On top of that there were university entrance exams to prepare for, and while that required no new theory, the problems were hard. In the university we had a semi-proof based calculus course which was hard, covered both single and multi-variable calculus and which I totally skipped the classes for and barely passed. It almost felt like analysis, and I was wondering is that much is needed for a physics student. \n\nSo in USA, people take different maths courses in high school, and some of them can substitute for courses like 18.01?",

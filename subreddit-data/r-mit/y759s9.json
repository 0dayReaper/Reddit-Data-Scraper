    "postText": "I\u2019ve heard of spaced repetition and how it\u2019s supposed to be more efficient for studying, but the problem is that it cuts into the time I have for doing PSETs. The classes are scheduled to where they give homework while you\u2019re learning and then there\u2019s a gap right before exams for studying/cramming. It doesn\u2019t feel right to take a break to study in the middle of when I have PSETs about to be due. Also, I know the concepts I\u2019m studying should be related to the homework, but knowing the basic concepts doesn\u2019t mean I know how to apply them, especially on the more complicated PSETs. How am I supposed to do spaced repetition and get good PSET grades? Will the increase in exam grades outweigh the decrease in PSET grades? Is the decrease in PSET grades temporary?",

            "comment": "Honestly,\n\nI don't think most engineering/math classes do well with spaced repetition.\n\nI've used spaced repetition more for HASS/humanities classes (like History, Foreign Languages, Finance). For instance, learning grammar rules, vocabulary, even memorizing timelines -- I'd set up a schedule like:\n\n7/8am wake up -- first pass of the day before shower  \nmidmorning -- second pass  \nnoonish hour -- third pass  \netc.\n\nBasically I used the \"90 minutes have elapsed, and this is out of my short-term memory, so I will swing through again.\" I have many boxes of flashcards for these classes (it's not terribly subtle). History, I usually didn't have a ton of flashcards.\n\nEngineering classes have a different pedagogy: like you read the textbook, go through the lecture, you review the lecture, you do the problem set, you practice with previous years' and terms' tests and finals, you go to review sessions, etc. The subject evaluations (when I was at MIT, it was the Course Evaluation Guide, but I've learned that administration has taken over that role and you need Kerberos authentication to see the subject evaluations) are a really good source of information on what is most helpful.\n\nSometimes I reviewed the pset as soon as I got it, and then kept an eye on the pset whenever we went through materials in lecture (so I'd cross-reference in my notes and on my copy of the pset).\n\nSometimes I'd review previous lectures when I had time (e.g., before the next lecture started).\n\nSometimes  what helped most is talking with classmates or the TAs, even without pencil and paper, walking through how to do the pset to see if I understood the material.\n\nSometimes what helped most was going to tutorials (like my 6.003 TA had awesome tutorials where he mined the last 5 years' worth of exams and finals and gave it to us as a handout, relevant to the week's worth of lectures). He would mostly have us walk through how to set up the questions and start solving -- and while it was completely optional, the three of us religiously attended every tutorial. And I tried to put the tutorial on the days I didn't have lectures/recitations.\n\nSometimes I felt it was more efficient to do the problem sets (or as much of it as possible) in a longer session rather than multiple short sessions, although the more difficult ones, I might attempt multiple times (and even over multiple days/sessions).\n\nThat's my best approximation of forced repetition.",

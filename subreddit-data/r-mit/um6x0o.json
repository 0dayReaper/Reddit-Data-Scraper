    "postText": "For people who have taken 6.009 recently, what is the grade cut-off for A? I know that grade will varies across different semester, but I just want to know if 90% cut-off for A is a normal thing in 6.009? Mine is slightly below 90%. \n\nFinal grade will be released soon but I'm just so anxious to concentrate on my other finals :(",

An A is not going to determine your future, so put it out of your mind so you can focus on your exams.\n\nProfs often will push students for/against A\u2019s depending on if you showed up to lecture, asked for help, did all of the P-sets, made a visible effort etc. If you did those things then you know you did everything you could to make it happen.",

I believe it has some MechE prereqs though. 2.00b is similar but focused on building toys, and infamously hard to lottery into.",

            "comment": "Never really liked the machine shop-centric classes. They tend to be designed for people with absolutely no skills. Which is fine and certainly important to have, but really taxing if you already know what you're doing. If you're actively seeking out machining, you might have more fun joining an engineering club like MITERS or Solar Car",

But if you only took HTMAA, you don\u2019t have pre reqs for the upperclassman machine classes in course 2 (which give preference to course 2s)\nOther than 2.670. HTMAA afaik uses laser cutting and 3DP, which are more similar to the course 4 and Integrated Design and Management courses (EM.S20,EM.S21,EM.S22). Course 15 had a Design for 3D printing class that\u2019s p cool. Id say best bet is to go makerspace route for a chill engineering experience hands on. Edgerton teams are not chill",

I assert that it\u2019s not chill because there are critical deadlines the team has to make that cannot be completely flexible or dropped, as people are relying on you. \n\nIt\u2019s nothing like HTMAA.",

Eventually started locking the shop indoors because they\u2019d try and use stuff without asking as well. Times change though I guess",

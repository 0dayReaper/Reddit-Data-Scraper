    "postText": "Hi there! I am an incoming staff member for a professor at Sloan and I need to find an apartment. I have never been to mit before but my professor said I should get an apartment close to the train area? \n\nI am an undergrad right now who has never lived off campus before (because of my age, a long story.) I don\u2019t know where to look for said apartments (I don\u2019t mind roommates either)\n\nAny advice or resource will be helpful!",

            "comment": "I am assuming they meant get an apartment on the red line? Sloan is by the Kendall red line stop, so you can commute in from other neighborhoods on the red line. You can find a map of the red line online and see what other neighborhoods are on it. Living directly in the Kendall area is extremely expensive, but if money is not a concern there are some options there. East Cambridge is also walkable and slightly cheaper, but still much more expensive than going farther out on the red line. \n\nYou can find apartments through apartments.com, Zillow, Craigslist, and Facebook. Facebook marketplace has listings and there is also a Harvard/MIT housing group plus several Boston housing groups. Be wary of scams and try to see stuff in person. If that's not possible, send a friend to check places out and/or insist on *live* video tours.",

Safety isn\u2019t really a concern anywhere but I\u2019d try to avoid Dorchester, Roxbury, Revere, and Mattapan if possible. On the Red Line, Quincy is a good option - safe, quiet, cheaper, and less than an hour to Kendall",

Arlington is the end of the red line for trains - the trains right now are pretty unstable, but then they are looking at eliminating bus lines and getting a lot of pushback so it's in a state of flux.  There are a lot - like a LOT of slumlords out here.  Be aware that even rooms shared can be over 1000 a month, outrageous to me.  \n\nIf content with just a room, I'd check out the offerings on this listserv:  [https://lists.bostoncoop.net/mailman/listinfo/bcn](https://lists.bostoncoop.net/mailman/listinfo/bcn)",

Personally I always preferred the ends of the orange line, but Quincy on the red would work too. Don\u2019t expect inexpensive housing for young professionals anywhere, you\u2019re likely going to have to live like a grad student for a few years on a staff salary, before you can afford a more adult living situation.\n\nGranted, Sloan may pay better than other staff positions, but yeah, post docs and grad students are struggling for affordable housing on the T, so don\u2019t have super high expectations.",

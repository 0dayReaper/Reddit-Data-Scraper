    "postText": "I'm from Montreal and plan to get into aerospace engineering. I first plan to get a bachelor's degree in Montreal and then maybe go to MIT for my masters or my phd (I do acknowledge that I am planning quite far ahead). My question is: Do I have a better chance of getting accepted into MIT (or any top engineering schools in the US/Europe) if I go at \"Polytechnique\" (Montreal), or if I go at McGill? Any answer or tip is welcome.",

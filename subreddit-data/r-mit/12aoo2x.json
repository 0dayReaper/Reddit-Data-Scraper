    "postText": "I recently graduated from MIT(Course 6-2). I took a course that used to be called 6.401/6.481(Intro to statistical data analysis). I think it's new number now is 6.3722.   \n\n\nI'm starting a new data science job and would like to review the material. However I was **incredibly stupid** and didn't download the files onto my local machine. Could someone share the files from that class? I'm just feeling so stupid right now, sorry for asking ):",

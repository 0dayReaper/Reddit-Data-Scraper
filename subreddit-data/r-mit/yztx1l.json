If so, they just need to make sure that team is aware they are remote hunting (most teams have their own discords/slacks set up for this, with their own forms, so defer to the team).\n\nIf they do not have a team and are looking for one, they can register online here: [https://mitmh2023.com/register](https://mitmh2023.com/register) under \"reserve without a team\". They're put on a general list of orphaned hunters, which is sent out to teams who can then reach out to your friend directly to recruit them.",

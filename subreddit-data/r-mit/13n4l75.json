    "postText": "I will be attending MIT as an incoming freshman male and am very lost in the process with finding the dorm. I don\u2019t want to be too far from my classes and the facilities as I am very interested in sports like basketball and tennis and I am a very social person who likes to go out when possible. I also would prefer not getting an extensive meal plan if possible. Which dorm(s) would best fit me?",

    "postText": "I'm very bored and don't want to write my essay so I wanted to compile a list of restaurants near MIT and their approximate price ranges. Suppose that each $ represents 10 dollars. As in $ means 0-10 dollar range, $$ means 10-20, etc. I'm accounting for tip, also this what I can remember from memory so it may not be 100% accurate. Please add your own suggestions! This list is not comprehensive or complete. It is just restaurants I have gone to and remembered atm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Cambridge Based\n   * Five Spice | $$\n      * Best and closest mala xian guo place near MIT. The food there is great and the price is very affordable. My go-to place for a long lunch during the day due to its proximity.\n   * Mysterious White Food Truck Area 4 | $ - $$\n      * It's shady but it's good. I don't know how they make it so good but the food truck parks right in front of Area 4 most days and there is always a line. It is a fast, cheap, delicious way to keep your stomach full especially if you have a tight schedule.\n   * L'Verdes | $\n      * Will fill you up. Will also take away your soul. Atleast if you get 10 subs they give you a free one.\n   * Anna's Tacqueria | $ - $$\n      * Is food. Will fill up stomach. Tastes decent I guess. Not a big fan of this kinda of food myself. Alot of people get it nevertheless. Good if you don't have time for anything else.\n   * Thelonious Monkfish | $$ - $$$\n      * Very expensive. It has sushi boats, fish dons and etc. Good place to bring your date. Wouldn't really go casually tho.\n   * HMart Go Go Curry | $$\n      * Amazing curry. It is fast, tastes good, and is in HMART so you'll be able to pick up snacks along the way.\n   * HMart Sakura Ramen | $$\n      * Same thing as Harambe curry. Closest ramen place to campus\n   * Dumpling Daughters | $$\n      * Pretty good asian food. I appreciate how clean it is and how efficient they make your food.  I like the food but it does not remind me of the stuff I normally eat, esp since alot of the stuff is premade.\n   * Chipotle | $ - $$\n   * Area 4 | $$\n      * Good pizza place(heard from others). It is very close to campus. Never been there myself though.\n   * The Smokeshop | $$\n      * I really like their smoked meats and their sauce. The price is a little bit on the higher side but it definitely a change of taste compared to the other restaurants named here. I personally think it is worth it.\n   * The Friendly Toast | $ - $$\n      * A really friendly breakfast diner that makes amazing comfort food. \n   * Roxy's | $$\n      * A close-by grilled cheese joint with great tots. I would personally think it is a lil overpriced esp the tomato soup but the taste definitely makes up for it.\n   * Oath's | $$\n      * Make your own pizza. Never enjoyed it but it is a good eat once in a while.\n   * Saloniki's | $ - $$\n      * Amazing pitas at this greek restaurant. It is probably as close to campus as you can get. The food is cheap and amazing. Students get free fries if shown ID.\n   * Taco Bell  | $\n      * \\+1 rep for taste, -1 rep for diarrhea\n   * Helmand  | $$ - $$$\n      * Kinda expensive Afghan restaurants. Their lamb is amazing and I would definitely suggest trying here.\n   * Pepper Sky | $$\n      * Amazing Thai food. Although I never went there personally, ever club orders it for events.\n   * McDonalds | $ - $$\n      * Only for late-night shenanigans\n   * Dumpling House | $$\n      * Amazing Asian restaurant that is also very cheap. Comparable to 5 spice although I think Dumpling house is a little bit better. The only downside is its really up Mass Ave(closer to Harvard than MIT)\n   * 430 Tavern | $$\n      * Go here for Boston dine out week. The steak tip lunch is amazing, the meat is perfectly tender and the asparagus is amazingly seasoned.\n* Boston Based\n   * Santouka  | $$\n      * The best ramen you'll find near campus. It is a 20 minute walk over the bridge. The line is very long so prepare for a wait. Do make sure to go in duos or by yourself since larger groups take longer to seat. (There is another one in Harvard that will seat you faster). Go here on a date lol\n   * Kaju Tofu | $$\n      * Amazing tofu soup place. My go-to place to eat when I'm in Boston. Definitely try this place out. Always get an egg in your soup.\n   * Hsin Hsin's | $(lunch menu) - $$\n      * Really cheap asian food that will give you diabetes or cancer. It tastes good but eat at your own risk.\n   * Chef Chang | ?\n      * Apparently the noodles are good? Never been before\n   * Love Art Sushi | $$\n      * Make your own sushi don place. It also offers hand rolls. I ate it a lot over the summer. The price is pretty affordable even with UROP pay.\n   * Pad Thai Cafe | $ - $$\n      * One of my favorite pad thai places I been to. I like the Indonesian Fried Rice alot. They give you alot of food compared to what you pay.\n   * Wendy's | $ - $$\n      * I love Wendy's chili's and baconator. What can I say.\n   * Boston Burger Company | $$\n      * Amazing burgers! Most of the burgers are very fatty and greasy and is impossible to fit in your mouth but it is soooo good. If you go at 4:20, the 420 burger(literally obesity burger) only costs 4.20.\n   * Pour House | ?\n      * ??? people I know always want to go so it must be good right???\n   * Peach Farm | $$\n      * Decent asian food place. Not sure if its worth the price since there are so many others which are better.\n   * Dumpling Palace | $ - $$\n      * This is the one on Mass Ave. The food is really bad. Go there if you're drunk and need to fill up your stomach\n   * Haruka Ramen | $$\n      * Outwayed by Santouka. It's not a proper ramen place since it also sells other noodles. Overall the quality is not that good. Source: my mom\n   * Gourmet Dumpling House | $$\n      * There is usually a long wait. The food is really good here especially the dumplings and xiao long bao. Would suggest going here, maybe on a date\n   * Taiwan Cafe | $$\n      * Can't actually remember much. It is average asian food. Nothing too particular but nothing too bad.\n   * Dumpling Cafe | $$\n      * Also average asian food. \n   * Double Chin | $$\n      * I've only been here once. The food was okay. I went with my gf and I never thought about going back. If invited I would go back but I wouldn't go out of my own choice. Wasn't too memorable\n   * Penang | $$\n      * I always liked Penang even at home. I like the shrimp noodles but it is definitely an average restaurant taste wise.\n   * Pho Pasteur | $$\n      * Argued to be the best pho place in Boston. greatly debated\n   * Pho Basil | $$\n      * On Mass Ave. Another Pho place but this one is closer to campus. The food is good, especially if you want Viet food. The distance to campus is a plus but the taste is a bit lower than Pho Pasteur.\n   * Hei La Moon | $$\n      * Great dim sum place. Go here with a group and you'll have fun.\n   * Tora Japanese Restaurant | $$\n      * Amazing sushi/fish don. I discovered this by accident and it is a kinda small and in the ground. But don't be deceived. It is very clean inside and the taste is A1.\n   * Quic Pic BBQ | $ - $$\n      * I came here when I was hungry late at night after a haircut and the food is decent. It has cha sao(bbq pork). I liked it and am willing to go back again.\n   * 5 Spices House | $$\n      * Have you ever play Angry Bird's lite? Well 5 spice in Cambridge is angry birds and this 5 spice is pretty much the same thing but as that 5 spice. I would go to the other one though.\n   * Ruckus | $$\n      * Surprisingly a ramen place. The price is a lil high for what you get. I don't plan on going there again. The taste was not WOW! enough for me to remember too much.\n* Allston Based\n   * Bonchon | $$\n      * Best fried chicken in Boston. Definitely go here once in your life\n   * Dumpling Kingdom | $ - $$\n      * Very average asian restaurant. Probably shouldn't go since there are wayyy better options\n   * Kaju Tofu | $$\n      * See above Kaju. Same thing, small differences in menu\n   * Seoul Soulongtang | $$\n      * Beef bone soup. Good to warming up on a cold day but I do feel like it is a bit bland.\n   * Tasty Pot | $$\n      * Amazing food. I really like this place and I try to come as much as I can. It is basically hot pot that they precook and most of it is spicy. \n   * Coreanos $ - $$\n      * Korean/Mexican fusion. It is a very interesting taste but pretty good nevertheless\n   * Le's Vietnamese Cuisine | $$\n      * Taste isn't much better than the other Pho restaurants. It is too far to be noted.\n   * Gyu Kaku | $$ - $$$\n      * Best thing about this place is the unlimited KBBQ. Eat as much as you can! There is alot of meat and the taste is amazing! If you like meat definitely go here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBonus Round(Bubble TeaPlaces)\n\n* Kung Fu Tea\n   * Down Mass Ave near Symphony,If you join ASA you get a discount\n* Gong Cha\n   * In chinatown, my favorite place in Boston\n    * Update: there is also one in Cambridge Galleria\n* Update: Abide\n   * More expensive, unique flavored, kinda hipstery bubble tea store next to Darwins. \n* Chatime\n   * It is good only if Gong Cha is closed since Gong Cha is just accross the street\n* Teado\n   * Cheap bubble tea, most clubs order from here for fundraisers\n* Royal Tea\n   * I think the price is a little bit higher than others. The taste is definitely unique. \n\nAlso check out the bakeries in Chinatown! They are amazing, I love raisin bread and egg tart. Also Kalai has haircuts for $13 dollars. They do a great job at cutting hair although there always is a wait. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways I hope that this helps somebody(at least when we all go back to MIT). I tried to remember as many as I can.  Back to my essay I guess.",

            "comment": "How about Flour and Clover? It's pricey for sure but they're great for lunch or even dinner sometimes. Or, for Flour, the occasional sweet tooth craving if I'm too lazy/cold to walk to Tatte or Darwin's.\n\nOtherwise I can hopefully add to your list:\n\n* Sulmona (in Kendall, very close to Area 4). It's Italian food, probably around the $$ range. A little on the fancier side in terms of Kendall but it's good for take out too.\n* There's also a Santouka in Harvard Square, though it's probably a similar distance to the one in Newbury/Boylston.\n* Sakana (probably $$) is Japanese and on Mass Ave, somewhere between Harvard and MIT. Decent sushi. Someone also mentioned Cafe Sushi near Harvard, which is excellent imo.\n* Ol\u00e9 \u2013 Mexican food. Pretty decent for Mexican food in Boston (and near campus). It's in Inman Square though, so it's a little walk from campus.\n* Futago Udon ($$) is around BU/Allston but I've seen a good mix of BU and MIT students there.\n* Basta Pasta Trattoria (maybe $ bordering on $$) is Italian food that tastes pretty homey/homemade in Central.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis talk of food has me missing campus though :(",

From what I\u2019ve heard it generally better and you can join the wait list on yelp before you leave so you won\u2019t have to wait! Given that it\u2019s only a 10-20 min walk farther I\u2019d say you\u2019d be there and back before you can get seated in the back bay one :)",

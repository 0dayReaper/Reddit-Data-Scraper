You're a CS major to learn CS concepts.** If that's too much for you, then find something else to major in.\n\nHe's literally the meme of \"why should I take calculus, it's not important\". I say this because he *literally says that at 3:24.*",

Most things you want to learn for industry (build a website, build an app) you\u2019d have to learn in your free time. \n\nBefore watching the video I was also gonna say it\u2019s broken in the sense that 90% (not actually number) of MIT undergrads go into CS. Class sizes are huge and there never seem to be enough faculty resources. You can\u2019t really talk to the prof because there\u2019s like a 3:500 ratio. There\u2019s also not enough TAs such that you need to wait for 2 hours at office hours to talk to one. You basically self teach.",

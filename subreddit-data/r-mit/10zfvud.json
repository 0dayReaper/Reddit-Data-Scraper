    "postText": "I'm currently a high school senior and admitted student to MIT, and I've heard that it's possible to get a BS in the first 3 years and a MS in the 4th year. Is this common, and has anyone had experience doing this? How much extra work is this?\n\nSpecifically, I'm planning to double-major in Course 6-3 and 18 for my bachelor's, and get a Computer Science master's.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s an MEng rather than an MS (though I don\u2019t think it matters), and I think it\u2019s more common to do it in 5 years total, but there likely are people who do it in 4. I think it would be difficult to double major and do the MEng in only 4 years but it\u2019ll be up to you figure out, and you have plenty of time\n\nAlso remember that when you\u2019re in the MEng portion of the degree, depending on your funding source you typically can only take up to 2 \u201cregular\u201d classes at a time (ie not counting research projects as a class even though there\u2019s technically a course number under some circumstances). Your focus at that time is usually on your thesis and potentially TAship as those are pretty time consuming",

I think any of the above is fine as long as you can explain how you pursued the field in your application. I\u2019m not on a grad committee though so idk for sure. I just don\u2019t want to dismiss it totally because I think it would at a minimum be helpful if you decided to apply to math programs. Don\u2019t overdo it trying to get that double major, but at least in the idk 6-3 program, doing a double with 18 was only a few extra classes (though you did have to make two of those CI-Ms of course)",

I wasn't course 6, so I'm not sure what the funding situation is like compared to normal financial aid in that department. In my department, doing a 5th-year MS in the 4th year would have cost me $10-15k even if I got funding (which wasn't guaranteed and was hard to get), and significantly more if I didn't secure funding. Meanwhile, undergrad financial aid fully covered everything for me.",

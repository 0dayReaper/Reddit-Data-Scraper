I'm a 24 year old cs grad student, willing to sleep on the couch, and will do the dishes. Hoping to save some money and meet new people. Will pay $200-$350 depending on if my designated sleeping square has a door and is cushioned lol\n\nNo food or pet allergies (Note: pets might trigger baby talking)  \nAlso quadrupled vaxxed :)",

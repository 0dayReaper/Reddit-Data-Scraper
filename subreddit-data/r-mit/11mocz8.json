    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nThis is a weird post. I was accepted to MIT for a PhD in 2020, and I was clinically depressed at the time and, deferred my decision. TLDR; I had a toxic adviser, and I didn't feel excited about being accepted (red flag?). Basically being broke at 27, projected forward another 5 or so years would mean a very long time worrying about finances. I did a lot of self-beating, could not motivate the value of doing the PhD for myself.\n\nWhile going through all of this, I found a job as a data scientist (in Europe) have been working myself up to a more senior position. Then I started longing for more, developed a different perspective of things.\n\nI contacted a few profs last year, asked if they were taking any students. I received replies from all of them, and I started thinking perhaps this is a sign for me to re-apply? And so I did.\n\nTurns out, I got rejected. A generic rejection email. No interviews, nothing. Thought I had a more flavorful CV this time, combined industry and research experience. \n\nWhat am I supposed to do? Feeling completely devastated. Having a hard time moving on. I am honestly in denial. 30 yo guy.",

            "comment": "As an older graduate student who came in with industry experience, let me give you a couple thoughts...\n\n1. I make a LOT less money than when I was in industry. When I graduate, I'm looking at starting salaries comparable with what I was already making. Financially, the PhD is probably a bad move in your position. It might open up different kinds of jobs, but the pay does not increase (and the lost years of moving of the industry pay scale really hurt).\n\n2. Don't feel bad about the rejection. Admissions is hyper competitive, and the panels are looking for literally any excuse to cut down the number of applications. That means a lot of rejections are completely arbitrary. The fact that you got in once is more than enough validation of your capabilities. \n\n3. Being a student during Covid was objectively awful. You probably dodged a bullet there - it would not have been good for your mental health. If I were you I would not regret the decision to defer and not accept.\n\n4. Don't delay your life until you're 35. Use your industry experience to pivot into new jobs if you want to do something different and learn new, practical skills. You'll feel a lot better for it and you absolutely have the capacity to crush it wherever you are.",

I tied a lot of my self-worth into my admit, and it's been kind of like having a chip on my shoulder throughout, the FOMO effect is strong.\n\nI haven't settled down or \"lived\" in the sense that I am stressing about my career and the what ifs of the potential trajectories. Of course you would never know, but getting into MIT feels like a huge deal to me in hindsight, and I don't want to regret that I missed out on this opportunity. It's not a fun existence, you know, and just feels like a big waste of time to go around and constantly think about it.\n\nHappy to follow-up on DMs. Curious to hear more from you.",

You may well have been a more promising candidate than in 2020, but the economy in 2023 is not what it was in 2020 -- lots of grant funding has been pulled, corporate research dollars have dried up quite a bit -- and your potential new advisors may have had their funding dry up unexpectedly, after you emailed them.\n\nGiven that you were already admitted once, you don't need to concern yourself with whether you meet that bar. It's pretty clearly not about you.",

There\u2019s so many things that go into phd admissions, including whether a specific faculty member \u2014 w similar research aspirations \u2014 is interested and available to work with you. This can change over time, eg if a faculty goes on leave, becomes chair or takes on new administrative roles. There are a million other possible explanations that have little to do with your aptitude. Don\u2019t take it personally",

I had horrible unsupportive advisor as well and I ended up dropping out after 5 years in. I would rather spend these years in industry to be honest. I would gain so much more value than being miserable and suffering while also being poor. MIT is great, but it\u2019s a very challenging place. It\u2019s also pretty cut throat as you compete with best and most intellectually fierce people. You MUST be in the right mindset to do it. Even those in the right mindset initially often go bonkers at MIT, forget about those who enter as a mess already. So, honestly, you did the right choice. There are tons of other places to consider",

I entered it when my most beloved person died and I just lost myself for few years. And those years were pretty foundational. \n\nAfter I dropped out I joined industry as a junior/entry level person. If I instead went to industry I would already be a good senior with a good pile of savings. Now I am broke, older, burned out, and starting from step 1 in pretty horrific shitty economy with mass layoffs around. \n\nYou will be in amazing spot with industry experience + PhD from another good institution, rather then failed at MIT and/or burned out to bones. MIT label gives only very marginal difference compared to other decent Phd institutions, but successful PhD, more supportive down to earth faculty people, better mental health AND past industry experience pushes you far far ahead of many MIT grads. \n\nAlso, many MIT people are very arrogant, including faculty. Especially faculty. There are some nice people here and there, but there is definitely a huge dense concentration of arrogant people who think they are better than the rest of the world. So if you struggle you may not find any support or understanding, unfortunately. \n\nI wish I did what you have done back ago.",

    "postText": "Hi all! Incoming grad student here and I just received my Kerberos account.\n\nI managed to log in to the email on Microsoft Suite and was wondering if I can do it on Gmail? No offense to Microsoft folks, but I have grown accustomed to the simplicity of G-Suite over my undergraduate years. I understand that I can set up forwarding as an alternative but was wondering if there is a more straightforward way to do it.\n\nThank you, kind people!",

When you forward your mail, any mail coming to your MIT account will be immediately redirected to the address you specify, and will not show up in your MIT email inbox or MIT web email access program (WebMail or OWA). When you split your email, a copy is made of all incoming email. One copy will appear in your MIT inbox as before, and another copy will be sent to the address you specify.\n\n[How can I forward my MIT email to another email address\\? \\- IS\\&amp;T Contributions \\-\u00a0Hermes](https://kb.mit.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3907262)",

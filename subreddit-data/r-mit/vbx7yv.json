    "postText": "I want to learn more about hydraulic system design.  I am specifically interested in robotic use cases.  I want experience designing hydraulics that are small and very quick, built around servo valves.  After 2.25 fluid mechanics, I am not sure which class would give me the best exposure to these sort of systems.  Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.",

Depending on the specific item, maybe you could integrate it into your 2.007 robot, but I\u2019ve never seen hydraulics used there.\n\nDespite the motto, MIT MechE has a agonizingly limited curriculum, especially for practical stuff (as opposed to theory, but we\u2019re limited on that front too). I\u2019ve been quite disappointed myself, if you can\u2019t tell.",

You can learn manufacturing, design, control, fluids, combustion, robotics, biomedical\u2026 you can even do hands on venture courses in the management section. What are you missing??? Like isn\u2019t 2.007 and 2.009 practical? What about 2.012 or 2.750 or 2.013?",

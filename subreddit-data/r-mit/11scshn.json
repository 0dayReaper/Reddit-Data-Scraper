            "comment": "Where in NY? I grew up in the NYC area and honestly barely noticed any difference when I moved to Boston. Boston gets a bit less sunlight than southern NY and spring usually starts a couple of weeks later, but it's definitely not \"much colder.\" IMO the Boston winter does not feel any colder, it's just slightly longer, and even that becomes less noticeable after the first year. Historically there is more snow in Boston, but in recent years that has become less and less true (climate change I guess).\n\nAnd if you're from far upstate or Western NY, the weather in Boston will actually be better than what you're used to.",

If you're asking about how much time you'll have for non-studying things, that depends on the person. Work-life balance is possible for most people if you prioritize it, but a lot of students also over-comit with many extracurriculars, heavier than required coarseloads, etc. It just depends what you value.",

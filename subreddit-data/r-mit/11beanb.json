I assume aiming for MIT has a higher purpose than making money because that's an overkill.\n\nEdit:\nWhat am I supposed to tell this kid? \n\nYour SAT score is low? My ACT score was 30, so who am I to say. And it's not like OP can't google and see the stats for MIT online on that. And it's not like they can do anything but study for it and try their best.\n\nYou seem to struggle in STEM subjects the most, so maybe MIT is not the best place for you? Perhaps, but I can only make that conclusion based on the fact that all 3 subjects they got a low grade in were STEM, so the sample size is not great. At the end of the day, I don't know what they want to do at MIT, but everyone needs to take GIRs at least, even if they go on to become a course 17 (pol-sci) major, so they have to do well enough in STEM to survive, but not any STEM - STEM at MIT where classes are faster-paced and more difficult than other universities. If they want to be a course 17, perhaps there are better places for that since MIT is an engineering school. Do I know a course 17 at MIT? Yes, but they have a background in math Olympiads from high school and are double-majoring in 18.\n\nYou aren't doing enough/you are doing wrong things, you should do X instead? Sounds ridiculous just by typing it. People do some things for college, like volunteer and join clubs and do projects. I think OP knows much better than me what their capabilities and opportunities are as well as how to find and take them. You can't join things you're bad at or things that you have no time for, and you don't want to join things that will take up your time despite you not enjoying them. Feeling bad because someone out there is doing more/better or some stranger on the internet that doesn't know your circumstances tells you you're not enough is just plain stupid and pointless.\n\nThere are reasons why we don't answer admission questions.",

To get a CS degree from MIT, you have to take intensive Calculus classes (as GIRs), math for CS, a ton of algorithm (read: more math) classes, etc. Also for GIRs, you have to take bio, chem, 2 physics classes, etc. There is no \"nullification\", the question is are you good enough at STEM to pass all these classes and do well - the admissions office will be the judge of that; all you can do is try your best. They obviously won't accept someone who they think will struggle and/or fail. My ACT score was 30, but my math score within was perfect and I did a math subject test with a perfect score and a physics subject test with a near-perfect score (both were required a few years ago) which supplemented my shitty ACT score to show that even though I can't read prose, I can read and do math and physics, i.e. STEM. \n\nAnd stop ignoring everything else I said. If I told you your bad grades would basically make it impossible to get into MIT, would you not apply? If I told you your bad grades don't really matter so much, would you continue getting bad grades even though you could get good ones? You're asking pointless questions; just do your best, do what you like, and apply to the schools that you like with some sense of reality (so don't just apply to MIT and ivy leagues).",

Take a step back and make sure you\u2019re applying to several places that seem like places you would thrive at.  Maybe MIT is one of them, maybe not.  It certainly isn\u2019t *the only* place.  In my opinion, if you\u2019re driven and smart then you\u2019ll find a way to success even if you go to a small school no one\u2019s ever heard of, but that offers the environment and community you need.\n\nYou also keep mentioning \u201cgetting the job.\u201d  You\u2019re still young so I don\u2019t expect you to know this, but a lot of times what gets you the job is not just having skills, but being someone who listens to others, considers the feedback, and responds appropriately.  That doesn\u2019t mean always doing and agreeing with what others tell you.  But it does mean not coming off as hard headed and argumentative.  On Reddit it doesn\u2019t matter, but in case you plan to come into your interviews with your back up please consider that there is absolutely a soft skills side people are evaluating as well.",

Just bc we got in, doesn\u2019t mean we discovered the secret formula for convincing AOs. And you coming here and listing your stats really just sounds like you\u2019re begging for a compliment. If you want to ask for advice, do that. If you want a bunch of mit kids to tell you how smart you are, you\u2019re gonna get shut down pretty quick. Take peoples advice here, even if it seems mean. Especially if they\u2019re asking you what specifically you want to do. It\u2019s probably not because they want to be dicks. A lot of people make this school their life in highschool and don\u2019t get in. Most people don\u2019t get in. Also, most people probably wouldn\u2019t be happy here. Try and figure out what YOU want, then figure out what institution can offer you that.",

Apple\u2019s recruitment process is pretty much the same as everyone else\u2019s, meaning you\u2019re gonna have to solve a number of algorithmic problems that will be significantly more challenging than the math section on the SAT\n\nSo, why don\u2019t you just study for the SAT and get a 1500+ there \u2014 that would definitely increase your chances at the other good schools. Get the College Panda books for math and writing and do a chapter a day \u2014 you\u2019ll be done in 30 days. For the reading section, get the Erica Meltzer\u2019s SAT reading book + khan academy for all 3 sections. All of these books you can find online for free, but I didn\u2019t say that. On top of that, there\u2019s the 1600.io books (I personally never used them, but heard good things)\n\nAs for Apple, the vast majority of Apple interns/employees I know went to Cal, but it\u2019s probably because of the location and the number of students there. I don\u2019t know much about NJIT, but if a lot of their students aren\u2019t particularly high achieving, the rigor of the classes might be questionable (and that heavily correlates with what they learn)\n\nGenerally, the school\u2019s prestige doesn\u2019t matter that much for CS. If you look at the employment outcomes, you\u2019ll see some differences between MIT/CMU/Cal and schools like IU Bloomington, for example (and, perhaps, NJIT as well), but it\u2019s not like NJIT CS grads work as Uber drivers. I just looked it up and NJIT grads, on average, make $43k less than Cal grads first year out of college ($77k vs $120k for the class of 2021 with 75 going to Apple from Cal and, I assume, around 0 from NJIT since there\u2019s no mention of it at all)\n\nEither way, you can go to a top university for grad school, but you would have to maintain a high gpa for that. IMHO, I would try to improve my chances of getting into a good college now. Math is very very very very important in Computer Science, especially for companies like Apple, Google, etc. \u2014 you\u2019re gonna have to learn a lot of it anyway, there\u2019s no use in wasting your time in high school. You can learn calc in the summer with khan academy/MIT OCW (or edX), take it in the fall and do well. At the very least, you can get scholarships at many less prestigious schools with a high score/gpa (Fordham is one of them, I think)",

Get the College Panda books for math and writing and do a chapter a day \u2014 you\u2019ll be done in 30 days. For the reading section, get the Erica Meltzer\u2019s SAT reading book + khan academy for all 3 sections. All of these books you can find online for free, but I didn\u2019t say that. On top of that, there\u2019s the 1600.io books (I personally never used them, but heard good things)\n\nWhat about Khan Academy? Also, I feel the SAT questions aren't particularly hard. It's just a matter of pacing? However, I'm generally not great at standardized tests. I only barely managed to get into advanced level on my NJSLAs and mostly get into the high 1100s on the PSAT (although I hear that's near 1300 on the SAT).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;As for Apple, the vast majority of Apple interns/employees I know went to Cal, but it\u2019s probably because of the location and the number of students there. I don\u2019t know much about NJIT, but if a lot of their students aren\u2019t particularly high achieving, the rigor of the classes might be questionable (and that heavily correlates with what they learn\n\nI know an iOS developer who is 25 years old, got Bs and Cs in high school, went to NYIT (worse than NJIT), but got an internship at Apple and now makes over 170K/year at Square. The only reason he chose to not stay at Apple was that he preferred to be in NY (something I don't care about).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Generally, the school\u2019s prestige doesn\u2019t matter that much for CS. If you look at the employment outcomes, you\u2019ll see some differences between MIT/CMU/Cal and schools like IU Bloomington, for example (and, perhaps, NJIT as well), but it\u2019s not like NJIT CS grads work as Uber drivers. I just looked it up and NJIT grads, on average, make $43k less than Cal grads first year out of college ($77k vs $120k for the class of 2021 with 75 going to Apple from Cal and, I assume, around 0 from NJIT since there\u2019s no mention of it at all)\n\nOn LinkedIn, I've seen a lot of NJIT grads at big companies, including Apple, and at the NJIT open house, they said the average salary after graduation is around 100-120K/year. Plus, without the student loan debt, I could do more with my money. For example, last year, as a sophomore in high school, I was able to afford an M1 Max MacBook Pro with only around $1500 in my bank account by strategically selling my other Apple products or other items worth of value I didn't need, and ended up paying off my monthly installments within two months, even with only earning part-time money. I feel this could definitely be possible on a bigger scale in adulthood so long as I don't have to worry about paying off my student loans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Either way, you can go to a top university for grad school, but you would have to maintain a high gpa for that. IMHO, I would try to improve my chances of getting into a good college now. Math is very very very very important in Computer Science, especially for companies like Apple, Google, etc. \u2014 you\u2019re gonna have to learn a lot of it anyway, there\u2019s no use in wasting your time in high school. You can learn calc in the summer with khan academy/MIT OCW (or edX), take it in the fall and do well. At the very least, you can get scholarships at many less prestigious schools with a high score/gpa (Fordham is one of them, I think)\n\nOn the NJIT sub, everyone is saying that the B- doesn't undermine the great work I've been doing in coding and app development.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I don\u2019t think the scholarship is really relevant here. Apple\u2019s recruitment process is pretty much the same as everyone else\u2019s, meaning you\u2019re gonna have to solve a number of algorithmic problems that will be significantly more challenging than the math section on the SAT\n\nThen how did my 25-year-old friend (who got a C in Calculus), get into Apple?",

I did like 2500 questions on khan academy back in 2020. The books can help you learn and recognize certain patterns and types of questions faster. The more questions you do, the faster you'll be able to solve them \u2013\u2013 it's that easy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;went to NYIT (worse than NJIT), but got an internship at Apple\n\nAt least now, you can't get an internship at Apple without passing their coding interview, which is largely (if not entirely) based on algorithmic problems (you can grind leetcode to learn the material on your own but will you?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;at the NJIT open house, they said the average salary after graduation is around 100-120K/year\n\nThat's probably bs, because I didn't pull the 77k out of my ass -- it's from their own class of 2021 survey ([https://www.njit.edu/careerservices/sites/njit.edu.careerservices/files/Starting\\_Salaries.pdf](https://www.njit.edu/careerservices/sites/njit.edu.careerservices/files/Starting_Salaries.pdf))\n\nAnd here's the UC Berkeley one: ([https://career.berkeley.edu/start-exploring/bear-destinations/](https://career.berkeley.edu/start-exploring/bear-destinations/)) \u2013\u2013 choose Year: 2021, Major: Computer Science\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Plus, without the student loan debt\n\nDebt sucks, but are you sure you would have to go into any at a school like MIT/Harvard/Princeton, etc. These schools have the best financial aid programs in the country. Sit with your parents and run the net price calculator for each of them. At Princeton, for example, if your family's income is below $160k/year, and they have typical assets for the income bracket, you get a need-based full-tuition scholarship (or close to that), same with other Ivies, Stanford, MIT, Duke, and other top private schools. And if your family's income is below $65k ($75k-80k at some schools), you'll get a full-ride scholarship. But yeah, if I had to take out $320k in loans to attend, I wouldn't either. As I said, it's not like NJIT grads work as Uber drivers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;On the NJIT sub, everyone is saying that the B- doesn't undermine the great work I've been doing in coding and app development\n\nA B- in precalc? In terms of college admissions, yeah, it definitely can. There's a  recent movie about college apps called 'Try Harder!' -- you can watch it and see for yourself; it's pretty accurate I would say. Not to mention, schools like MIT, Caltech, Harvard, etc. highly recommend (aka almost require) taking calculus before applying. On top of that, iOS app development is one of the easiest areas there is. I  worked as an iOS dev when I was 14-18, I wouldn't say it was particularly challenging. Plus, if you go to r/chanceme and look through the cs posts, you'll see that basically everyone and their mom is an iOS developer now. I should also add that part of my work I did exclusively in Objective-C (+ no storyboards), and I remember how much time it took, but then teams started to adopt Swift, then SwiftUI, and now Flutter (though I'm not a fan). It takes significantly less time to develop an app with SwiftUI (= you need less people for the same amount of work), and it's only been a few years. Imagine what's it going to be like when you graduate and then 3-5 years after that. A lot of people being able and actually wanting to enter the field + Apple making it even easier every year + Apple constantly reducing the time it takes to develop an app -- none of these promise that fruitful of a career a decade from now. Don't limit yourself to one technology\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do research now, and I don't see many people without degrees trying to get into the field, despite it paying way more ($240k+). The reason is it's on the verge of impossible to learn stuff like quantum physics, real analysis, linear algebra, optics, thermodynamics, etc. on your own and be good enough at it -- that's what college is for. You get 4 years to learn some pretty hard stuff while being babied by some of the smartest people in the world and, imho, spending it on something you can easily learn online is wasteful. And obviously you're going to be way more challenged at a harder school with high achieving classmates and the most accomplished faculty\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Then how did my 25-year-old friend (who got a C in Calculus), get into Apple?\n\nLeetcode grinding? I'm sure you can find people from a community college in Montana working at Google or people that never went to college working at Apple -- it doesn't necessarily mean going that path will give you the same opportunities. It's an example of survivorship bias -- look at the average, not the exceptions\n\nBut here's a tip for prepping for the interviews. Do USACO (r/USACO) now and you'll be able to breeze through the coding problems when the time comes (regardless of the school you choose), while others will struggle. Plus, it's a fun extracurricular activity and a decent achievement for college apps",

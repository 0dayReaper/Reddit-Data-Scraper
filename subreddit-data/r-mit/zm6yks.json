Generally large classes will check, but there's no rule.\n\nFor example, as a freshman I had some sophomore friends taking a final and since I was bored I actually took the exam with them and just meme'd on the page. They never checked ID.\n\nAnd yes, I realize taking a final for funsies is certainly nerd activity. I've changed, I swear",

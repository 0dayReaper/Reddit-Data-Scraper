    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm currently a Course 1 (Civil Engineering) grad student, on the PhD track but am not completely sold on continuing on for the Doctorate. A bit of my background: I work with AI and machine learning for some technical civil engineering applications (and find it pretty cool), have been doing research (peer-reviewed and published) since high school. I like research but don't love it and don't want to pursue the traditional academia career path.\n\nI'm obsessed with entrepreneurship, started a real estate investment company at 15 and have been doing pretty well for myself these past 12 years. Decided to come to MIT for my masters because my parents really pressured me into grad school and, honestly, as an engineer, you can't really turn down MIT after being accepted. \n\nMy PI has stated that he would love for me to continue on to the PhD and I've had a really hard time deciding. It's a huge commitment, and one that I would not take lightly. Guess I just wanted to hear from you guys (especially current PhDs and grads, also those of you who \"mastered out\") on your opinions of how the degree shaped your life and how important you feel it is (not only in a professional sense, but also personally). \n\nTL;DR: am struggling to decide on continuing on for the PhD or \"mastering out\". Want to hear from former/current MIT grads (especially in engineering) on how the PhD experience changed your life.",

Kept taking classes, and decided I really wanted a PhD. When I finished, the internet was just beginning and it was pretty obviously going to be huge.\n\nAcademia looked interesting, but being a prof changed a lot from when I began undergrad to when I finished grad school. Most profs had transitioned to spending the majority of time raising money. To me, it looked like all of the work of founding a startup without much of the financial upside. (I haven't kept tabs on my prof friends, so I hope that's changed in the current environment.)\n\nSo I landed at Bell Labs at Lucent: All of the great fun of research without any of the fundraising. Then went and cofounded a startup. Met the VCs, raised $20M first round (which was a lot of money in 2000).\n\nMy particular path would not have been possible without the PhD. But like I said in the opening, it comes down to \"What do you want to do with your life?\"",

Sometimes a PhD opens doors entrepreneurially, but mostly results speak for themselves.\n\nOne thing I learned in my PhD is that you really have to have string **intrinsic** motivation to complete it. If your parents were one of driving factors for you going to grad school, it's going to be hard for you to stay motivated when you hit a roadblock (which honestly could last years). So I guess I'd say that if you have a fairly well scoped thesis topic that youre confident about, you might be able to continue just \"regular\" hard work and get through it. But if there is ambiguity in your research, I'd consider whether what drives you now is enough to carry you through.",

As a Latinx woman, it's certainly hard to gain respect from mostly male peers who are much older than I am (being investors, contractors or clients), so I feel that a PhD would help with that. \n\nAs for my parents, it's the route they went (both are Harvard Phds) and they certainly feel that missing out on this opportunity, since I already got accepted to the program would be outrageous.\n\nIt would certainly be hard to reject my PI's invitation, he is a great mentor and has helped me grow in ways that go way beyond academic prowess. My career plan wouldn't necessarily require a PhD, but it would definitely not hurt to have one. As for the last question, I have been studying entrepreneurship literally for 12 years. Also, my PhD would, in many ways, help me with my entrepreneurial goals, as I will continue meeting and working with awesome people both in the investor and founder sides of things. \n\nI've built a multi-million dollar company that is healthily growing and I am looking for what's next. I want to get into fintech, particularly as a CTO or similar and having a PhD from MIT would also be good to have (I can still do it with my SM + years of experience actually doing things). \n\nOn the other hand, I've had a lot of success in research and enjoy the novelty and challenge of trying to figure out new things. Also, down the line, when I hope to build up my own construction related startup, a PhD would probably come in handy.

I think GP's advice is pretty spot on and wanted to add a couple things:\n\nWhenever a lab gets a new student, the PI and the lab need to invest some time and money to get them up to speed and integrate them. Your PI and lab already invested that in you, so if you're reasonably productive (which it definitely sounds like you are!) it's in their best interest to hold on to you -- they can now benefit from your productivity without additional start-up costs. That's not necessarily the same thing as it being in your best interest, though. So don't feel bad about turning them down if you're not sure staying in this lab is absolutely the best way to accomplish your own personal goals.\n\nAlso, IME the reason people quit PhD's is almost never that they weren't capable of doing the work. More often they just realize/decide they would rather spend their life doing something more meaningful to them than research. It sounds like you already know something else is more meaningful to you than research...in which case, frankly, I would just invest the time you might have spent on the PhD, on that something else instead. Life is too short to devote several years of it to slogging away at something that's more \"nice to have\" than central to your goals.",

I didn't get a masters or PhD, so I can't help you there other than to say that the experience you get at work is incredibly valuable, and that my coworkers with Masters &amp; PhDs are doing well, but that they really enjoyed it and called it the best of their academic/professional careers. \n\nIf you're trying to convince yourself to do it, then maybe it's not for you.

If in a year or two you decide you miss academia, chances are very good you\u2019ll still be able to come to MIT for a PhD. After all, that extra experience will only make you more valuable as a researcher, potentially give you some extra perspective, and you won\u2019t be constantly fighting the \u201cwhat if\u201d feeling throughout grad school.\n\nIf you decide to stay in industry or entrepreneurship, then great! No loss from skipping the PhD. And even if gets boring 15 years from now, chances are you can *still* come back for a PhD. (This was me: MIT Masters \u201806, started at Berkeley for CS PhD in 2019.)\n\nOnce you get the PhD, you are forced to choose a track: it\u2019s much harder to get a professor position if you choose entrepreneurship after your PhD but decide a few years out that you want to come back to academia.",

My monthly stipend in 2012-14 was $30k, pre-tax (excluding the free tuition). I don't know how much the PhD students were making but I can't imagine it was much beyond $40k. My first job after graduating was 3x that, in a city where the cost of living was easily half that of the Boston metro area.\n\nAI/ML for engineering applications sounds like an easy sell for Ansys.

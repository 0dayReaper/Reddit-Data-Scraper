    "postText": "Hi guys. I am international student from Bangladesh. I have been admitted to the PhD track graduate program at Department of Materials Science and Engineering of MIT. I recently got my I20 and it says my level of degree is Master's and my duration of study will be 2 years. I contacted the department and they said all Dmse international phd students get this in their I20. After successfully qualifying for PhD, they will renew my I20 again. My question is I am intending to complete my PhD at MIT DMSE. Therefore during completing my DS160 form, I am not sure if I should put doctoral or MS as my intended degree. Also what should I put as my duration of study?\n\nAny international student who faced the same situation, please give me your suggestion.",

Once you pass your thesis/quals component of your masters, you move onto your PhD stage. This is different from many programs and fields. \n\nGiven what the international office said, and the documentation they've issued to you, I would stick to what written documentation says at all times. If you write something that appears inconsistent with MIT has declared to CBP, you might run into some problems. You won't have any problems getting into the country with that DS160 form.",

            "comment": "I too recommend matching what the form says. And also remember that a student visa is nonimmigrant, so never tell a DHS/consulate employee anything suggesting you\u2019re planning to stay longer than what the form says. A friend was asked what his plans after graduation were, and he honestly replied he may look for a job in the US and got his visa application denied.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am a non-MITian coming to Boston for a summer internship in some company. A graduate student from a grad house offered me a room in their 3bhk apartment for $1k/month. First of all, is the price reasonable? Secondly, while I understand it\u2019s not allowed for non-MITians to sublease, I currently don\u2019t have a good option in hand thus want to consider it. What will happen if I get caught?\n\nP.S not using main account for obvious reasons \n\nThank you!!",

I\u2019ve heard of ppl finding spots in Medford for less than 1k with 3 roommates but it\u2019s expensive here",

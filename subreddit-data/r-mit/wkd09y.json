            "comment": "6-3 is more streamlined for what you'd do as a Software Engineer, but I'd pick it more based on the material you'd like to learn - plenty of skilled software engineers get degrees from MIT in 6-2 (and 6-1, and 18, and everything else).\n\nTake a look at the [courses that help for a 6-3 degree](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/): Artificial Intelligence, Computation Theory, Graphics, Software, etc. You can pick and choose what seems appealing, and what you think best fits for the job you'd like to have.\n\nThen take a look at [6-2](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/electrical-engineering-computer-science-course-6-2/). It's mostly a superset of 6-3, where you'll need to take CS classes, but fewer of them, and supplement them with Electrical Engineering classes: Circuits, Signals, Nanoelectronics, etc. Again, it's your choice how you progress through these.\n\nAre there courses in the 6-2 list that you'd prefer taking over taking more of the 6-3 courses? If so, you should pick 6-2. Would you prefer taking more 6-3 courses than diversifying and taking EE and CS courses? If so, you should pick 6-3.",

But as the comment below said, it doesn't matter since you declare your major at the end of freshman year (and you can even declare undecided).",

(I realized too late that I would have preferred 6-3). It also looks like they did a bunch of course renumbering for some reason. Also surprised they seem to have removed 18.600 from the acceptable probability requirements",

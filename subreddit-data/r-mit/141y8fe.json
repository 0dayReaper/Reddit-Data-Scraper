    "postText": "Hey BU student here! I'm a MechE student looking to get some more research experience. BU hasn't really been putting in funding into MechE for a while now so there isn't a lot of interesting research going on here. **So I was just wondering whether anybody knows if its possible for a non-MIT student to do some form of a research position at MIT?** Tips and pointers to any other colleges would be appreciated to, just trying to \"spread a net\" over here. Thanks in advance! Cheers.",

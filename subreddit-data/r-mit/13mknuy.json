I provided my insurance details during the visit while being registered. \n\nDoes anyone know what I'd need to do in order to notify the insurer that I had a visit in the emergency room? The instructions on the Mass General [website](https://www.massgeneral.org/notices/billing/insurance)\u00a0(copied below) states that I need to notify my insurer as soon as possible, but for the MIT SHIP insurance it's unclear who to contact. I sent an email to [stuplan@med.mit.edu](mailto:stuplan@med.mit.edu) but I'm not sure this is the correct contact.\n\n*Emergency Care*\u00a0\n\n*If you are admitted to the Emergency Department and belong to a managed care group, such as an HMO or PPO, you must notify your primary care doctor and insurer as soon as possible. If you fail to do this, your insurer might not agree to pay your entire bill. Mass General will make every effort to notify your insurer that you are in the hospital, but this is ultimately your responsibility.*",

            "comment": "Honestly, if I were you I would just wait for the bill (likely just the emergency co-pay). I know the website says to contact your insurer, but that's mostly a problem if you have out of state insurance. BCBS gets stuff from MGH all the time. If you have an online account (I don't know what portal they use nowadays), you can monitor it and see if the claim pops up. \n\nMIT student health also has an office that specifically deals with insurance claims. If you go during office hours, they'll direct you there to talk to somebody. \n\nSeriously, this is probably the best insurance you'll ever have for the rest of your life (in America).",

A few weeks later i got a humongous bill in the mail. \n\nWorried, I then made an appointment with my PCP, who told me to not panic, and that he'd get the office to take care of it. Two weeks later, i got a new revised bill just for the co-pay. \n\nMIT health insurance has the best value on paper but back then the customer service was a bit lacking, even if it worked out in the end.",

Second is to get them be aware of what's going on abd what you need. \n\nGood luck figuring things out! Hopefully you are already recovered or you are on your way there.",

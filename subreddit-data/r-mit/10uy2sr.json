    "postText": "Does anyone know how the doctorate program works if I am coming in with a masters already? Do I have to still take the same amount of classes for the \"MIT masters\" or do I just get to waive classes I took in my masters at another institution and take the classes I want to take / is there no class requirements. Does that speedup the timeframe of the PhD in general or is it roughly the same? Hoping to hear from someone with a similar situation. Thank you!",

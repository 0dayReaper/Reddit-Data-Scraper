For about a year the door to President's has been deadbolted from inside the infinite, but if you simply walk around outside to the wind tunnel you'll see it. If you're facing Nano/26/Stata from the windy boye, just turn right and you'll see a little parking area and a sketchy basement electron microscopy lab. Take a left at that sketchy door and the tree will be right in front of you.",

    "postText": "At present, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Concordia University, Montreal. My graduation is scheduled for the following year. However, I am keen on furthering my education in the field of software or computer science. I would like to proceed with a Master's program if one is available, or consider pursuing a Ph.D. if it includes a Master's degree. Could you please guide me on the admission process? What are the requirements and the necessary skillsets for these programs? I am eager to start preparing as soon as possible.",

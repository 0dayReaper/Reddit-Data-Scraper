I have a Comp bio background, but I am not sure what I will major in. \n\nAny advice on which events you would suggest attending from an academic and social perspective? Any advice on the recent fraternities? Pros and cons of joining?",

I am sure there are CS and bio related activities, but my interests are in different areas so I\u2019m not too familiar with them.",

You can fill your weekend with exploration of Cambridge/Boston, doing a bunch of academic challenges/hackathon type stuff, meet with different clubs (music, dance, arts, technical, etc), playing pick up sports, partying, meeting people, everythin in between.",

I loved one form in particular and applied to live there, and that is where I met almost all my college friends\n\nSo I would definitely recommend the dorm-hosted events (both the dorm-wide ones and the ones hosted by the sub-communities - houses, wings, floors, whatever they\u2019re called in that particular dorm)",

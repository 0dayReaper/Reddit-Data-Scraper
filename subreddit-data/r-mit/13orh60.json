Once you\u2019re there, assess the room, talk with your roommates, and make a trip to Target. \n\nThings you may want to buy when you\u2019re there, depending on your dorm, food situation, and finances: electric kettle, rice cooker, mini fridge, window A/C unit, bicycle, decor items like curtains, lamps, and wall art. \n\nSome of these are unnecessary in certain dorms, and some are not allowed. If you can survive until the end of first year without them, you can often get A/Cs and mini fridges cheap from graduating seniors. The MIT police used to have a regular sale of used abandoned bikes; not sure if they still do. If you like art, sign up for that program where MIT will loan you legit works of art for your dorm wall. \n\nDon\u2019t forget about your hobbies. It\u2019s true that you\u2019ll be very busy, but there are tons of opportunities for intramural sports, music practice, etc. If you\u2019re going home for Thanksgiving/Christmas, that might be a good time to take that gear \u2014 give it a little time to figure out which hobbies you\u2019ll have time and space for.",

That was true in East Campus, where I had an electric kettle, rice cooker, and even a rarely-used electric meat-grilling appliance in my single. No one ever checked. However, I started in McCormick with roommates and it would not have worked there.",

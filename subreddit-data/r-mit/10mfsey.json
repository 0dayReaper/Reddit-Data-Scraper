    "postText": "I'm currently a highschool student and I'm looking into trying to take the Physics II Electricity and Magnetism on OCW ([https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2007/pages/syllabus/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2007/pages/syllabus/)) . The issue is that I'm sort of confused on how exactly I'm supposed to move through the class if that makes sense (as I'm used to a high school class with a bit more structure). Is there a recommended schedule or structure to OCW courses (eg. read these pages in the textbook, then watch this lecture, then do this problem set, then move on to this unit, etc) or do they just have it all laid out for you and you just figure it out. Also, with the specific course I'm looking at (Physics II), I can't find my lectures on the website or solutions to problem sets ... am I missing something? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: How do I structure taking an MIT OCW course (particularly Physics II) and know which parts I should read / complete and the order I should do this in?",

You're expected to follow it by looking at all the assigned material in each week. It seems that Class Activities page has that. There may be extra problems as well somewhere else, and you can always look at whatever book the class follows and try to do problems in the same chapter.\n\nI didn't see any solutions, but that shouldn't stop you from following the course and trying your best.",

I would do the learning sequences (online MIT course) found here: [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2019/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2019/). You will have to go to the three links on the side bar. Each cover a fundemental aspect of 8.02 and concepts questions and PSETs and videos are embeded inside. If you want to learn, this is the exact actual course. Have fun :)",

You just have to know where 2-3 of the nearest laundry rooms are located, and usually you'll be able to use the very first laundry room you go to. Some issues can crop up with having to move to another laundry room to find an open dryer, because they brilliantly put an equal number of washers and dryers but dryers take double the time. But really, I cannot say anyone complained about the number of laundry machines at all. Mostly just that Washlava sucks as a company.",

Laundry rooms are not that large, and they get overcrowded on weekends everywhere. So if you're doing your laundry on a weekday or sth, you probably won't even notice is my guess.",

If you choose the wrong time they might be full, but it's usually pretty easy to find a time when they're not being used (personally I often do laundry at like midnight). Just don't wait until the last second to do your laundry and you'll be fine.",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I\u2019ve currently waiting for my decision from MIT and had a question regarding coursework. I worked with my counselor to do a physics independent study for this spring semester through the community college. MIT recommends two semesters of physics, but I\u2019ve only taken 1. That okay, and do I still have a fair chance, given that I\u2019ve taken all the other math/science courses and have test scores within range. Thanks!",

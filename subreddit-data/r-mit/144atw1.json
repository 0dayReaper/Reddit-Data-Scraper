    "postText": "Hello, I'm currently working on an application where I'm trying to utilize the capabilities of the GPT-4 API over GPT-3.5. My goal is to achieve greater accuracy in the responses generated.\n\nCurrently, I'm on the waitlist, but it seems to have no clear end in sight.\nIf your account has GPT-4 access, I'm interested in discussing options to purchase your complete account from you. It would involve transferring the organization over, which I can provide guidance on if necessary.\n\nI'm open to any potential collaboration and would be grateful for help here. Please feel free to respond to this post or DM me to discuss. I look forward to hearing from you.",

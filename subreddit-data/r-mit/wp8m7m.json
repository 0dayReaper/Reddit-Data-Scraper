Sadly, I think those days have come to an end, but it would be nice as an alum to regain access.",

From the letter: \n\n&gt; As students at MIT, many of us were able to collaborate with people from outside the MIT community. \n\nStill possible obviously, either in outdoor / common spaces or with a TIM ticket / escort.\n\n&gt; High school students and community members were able to attend lectures. \n\nWould want to see numbers on this, plus there's a discussion to be had on whether or not they should be able to without prior permission, in which case it's still possible with a TIM ticket / escort. Also, OCW exists. \n\n&gt; Students, faculty and staff were able to hold meetings for events on the campus. \n\nStill possible with TIM ticket / escort. \n\n&gt; Alumni were able to drop by to visit professors and advisors. \n~~~~\nStill possible with Tim ticket / escort, but I do think alums should be able to get general access.\n\n&gt; Visiting scholars were able to easily move between departments and collaborate. \n\nStill possible: \"Tim Tickets are not designed for MIT visiting student/scholar/scientist and research affiliate appointments, exchange or cross-registered students, those auditing a class, or contractors ... Invited visitors in these categories will be entered into the Covid Pass system, be issued an MIT Kerberos username and MIT ID card, and must meet requirements for vaccinations and testing.\"\n\n&gt; Tech and life science entrepreneurs have dropped by lectures during their lunch break. \n\nStill possible with TIM ticket / escort. \n\n&gt; Camera-toting tourists shared space with Nobel laureates along the Infinite Corridor.\n\nStill possible, just outside or with a TIM ticket / escort.\n \n____\n\nMost of these impacts seem a bit like a wash, especially while more than one pandemics are ongoing.\n\nProbably not a popular opinion, but the two main responsibility the institution has is to 1) educate students and 2) keep them safe. I don't know that diverting resources to have an open campus lends to those responsibilities.",

They were every single month, and never, ever missed a month, even in the worst weather, even on holidays. These exams were always open to the public, and about half the applicants were from the public (as opposed to MIT). This info I got from a friend who used to run the exams until he sadly passed away last year. My understanding is that they've now shifted to virtual exams. I took my exam in person 5 years ago.\n\nFor an event like this that welcomes the general public, what are people supposed to do? Tim tickets require a particular MIT person to authorize you personally - but that doesn't work for the general public. Also, they are only authorized until 6pm. These exams were always held in the evening. How are MIT people supposed to allow the general public to attend events for the general public? Tim tickets are obviously no solution (and not to mention, they're only good for people who own smartphones, which is certainly many, but also less than people tend to think).",

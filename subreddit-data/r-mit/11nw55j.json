    "postText": "I\u2019m a sophomore in 6-3, and last semester, I got 3 Bs (1 in a required major class - 6.046, 1 in a grad-level major class, and 1 HASS). This put my GPA at a 4.7. I was wondering which classes, if any, I should put on PNR? (We get to put up to 48 units on PNR retroactively). I have no plans of going to grad school. I hope to go into quant or SWE. I\u2019m worried because it seems like quant firms care about GPA? Today is the deadline for applying Flex PNR for last semester.",

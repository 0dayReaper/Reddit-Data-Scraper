There is no coding in 6.046 so I found it took less time for me than 6.006 (I was course 18 if that makes a difference). It is a super interesting class, top 3 of all time for me, it\u2019s just very proof heavy and difficult so it is best if you have a strong mathematical and problem solving background.",

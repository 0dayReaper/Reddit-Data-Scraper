    "postText": "If someone could send this in the MIT '27 Discord server it would be great. I think they should all know ahead of time about this. It's a serious issue and I hope none of the incoming freshman fall for this.\n\nThrowaway account here. Back when I entered MIT, I did an FPOP called Freshman Outdoor Program  (FOP). We were told that this program was \"FOP - First Year Outdoors Program - Outward Bound (Kayaking - Boston Harbor/MA Coast)\". I was excited for the program until I got there.\n\nWe paid $580 ahead of time (&gt;$600 if you include tax) for this program. Turns out, we were whisked to some random island in Boston Harbor called \"Thompson Island\" where we were dropped off and under the surveillance of the staff of the program called \"Thompson Island Outward Bound\". Now, I've gone to programs in the past on islands without communication with anyone outside and those have been fine. This one was different - it was *absolutely horrible*. I had no idea we were to kayak to *other islands* or even sleep in tents. I just thought we were going to have fun kayaking near the Charles River and around Boston, not away from the city. I just wanted to have some fucking fun.\n\nFirst things first: The housing conditions. Wait, did I say \"housing\"? Turns out everyone slept in a tent that smelled like dogshit. They were so small that we couldn't even *stretch* or *roll over*. It was suffocating and I was overheating every night due to the little room in the tent I could roam around. The \"instructors\" gave themselves BETTER tents, which is just fucking rude of them - why do they get to live in better conditions than us? Additionally, we weren't even given beds or even PILLOWS. All we got was a sleeping pad which was hard af and the program instructors were like \"use your clothes as a pillow\". Are you kidding me? This wasn't what I paid $580 for.\n\nIt gets worse when you consider other factors. We had very limited food the whole time, and I was constantly hungry. The food was almost always cold, too. One morning, guess what they provided us? JUST A PLAIN BAGEL. No way am I going to be nourished purely from that. They couldn't even account for allergies and whatsoever (although I wasn't allergic). Allergic to gluten? Well, half of your rations are gone. The toilet situation was also bad. When we were on the main island and around 200 yards from an actual bathroom, the instructors wouldn't even let us use it. They said \"it's for the camp experience\" but I doubt it - they're just fucking lazy and don't want to walk with us. Instead, we had to use a porta-potty-like thing that was worse (called a 'head bucket') with shit already in it and it smelled HORRIBLE. On the other islands, we had to poop in \"wag bags\" and whatever (yes, standing with a bag between your legs to catch your poop) which was ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS. At least let us know IN ADVANCE if we have to do those things.\n\nNow for the worst part: the course instructors were horrible people. They never organized ANY interesting activities. They were not empathetic and didn't care shit for me (and presumably others too). I started not feeling well after the first night since I slept on a rough surface and the food upset my stomach a bit. The kayaking we had to do made me a bit motion sick, too. The instructors? They just replied with \"You're just nervous\". They didn't know shit about how I was feeling and didn't care for me. When I asked to use the actual bathrooms they didn't allow me even though the smell of the fucking nasty head bucket made me want to throw up and I told them that. When I told them \"I feel like I'm about to throw up\", they just said \"throwing up is normal\" and dismissed me. When we were about to start kayaking that day, I asked them if I could consult my family on this matter because I seriously didn't feel well. They said no. I asked them what they would do if I felt worse and couldn't kayak further. They said they'd keep me on the island until I felt better. WHAT THE FUCK? I asked if I could leave the fucking program. THEY SAID NO - \"Take a foot out of your comfort zone\". I don't have a fucking comfort zone when it comes to this, and these instructors were being dickheads at this point. This was on the main island still and there was a boat leaving the island every afternoon. When I talked back to them again about my rights, they claimed I waived my rights (I CHECKED THE FORMS LATER AND I DID NOT WAIVE MY RIGHTS. I ALSO WAS A FUCKING ADULT AT THIS POINT SO THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.) and started ignoring me after that when I complained. There were tears in my eyes at this point and they forced me to kayak (2-person kayaks) with someone to our next island. When I didn't kayak as hard since I didn't feel so well, one of the instructors told me to kayak harder. HELLO? I JUST TOLD YOU I DIDN'T FEEL WELL SO OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT KAYAKING AS HARD AND THAT'S JUST FUCKING INSENSITIVE TO SAY. When we finally reached a midpoint island on that day's itinerary, I had to threaten to run to the dock on the island (where other people unrelated to this horrendous program were) for the instructors to say \"We'll ask the program manager if you can call your parents and leave\". This process took TEN FUCKING HOURS because they were just making up excuses to keep me there and not allow me to contact someone external about the maltreatment they were giving me. First, the instructors said that they have to get MIT's permission first. HELLO? WHY DO YOU NEED TO GET MIT'S PERMISSION FOR ME TO TALK TO MY FAMILY? After that, they pretended like the program director didn't respond to them yet when we got onto the island we would be lodging for that day. I was pissed and decided to take a walk around the island AND THE FUCKING PROGRAM INSTRUCTORS FOLLOWED ME WHEREVER I WENT. That's just intruding my privacy especially since I wasn't in a good mental state at that time. At some point I got pissed enough that I found an adult unrelated to the program on the island (with kids) to talk to and asked him if I could contact my parents with his device. He was just about to do that when ONE OF MY PROGRAM INSTRUCTORS INTERCEPTED US AND TOLD HIM THAT HE COULDN'T DO THAT. In addition, these instructors watched me like a fucking inmate: Later that day when I went to brush and got back, they told me I had to TELL THEM WHEREVER I WENT when that was NOT a rule. I was so fucking fed up with these idiots and told them that if they kept me there without communication I would file a fucking court case against them for a) violation of my privacy and b) providing me a horrendous experience that would affect my mental health and that was what I had to tell them for them to even let me contact my fucking family.\n\nAfter contacting my family, I felt a bit better but these course directors watched me like fucking hawks and would tap my tent when I WAS SLEEPING just to make sure I didn't go off and take a walk or something. Did I mention that they made us wake up at 6am too?\n\nAt the end of the program, WE HAD TO CLEAN THE FUCKING MATERIALS and THAT TOOK HALF A FUCKING DAY. Yes, they made us clean the tents which smelled fucking horrible even after cleaning, and even the dishes and things we used to eat and store food or water. EVEN THE KAYAKS. Like the course instructors and Thompson Island Outward Bound staff did NOTHING for us except provide food, water, shitbags, and reusable things and we paid $580 for it. I paid $580 for reusable materials that made me feel very shitty, horrible food, and abuse from instructors. They should be paying US for us to attend such a horrible program.\n\nI later went to s\\^3 and my advisor to talk about this experience and I still have horrible memories from it. It really adversely affect my mental health when starting MIT. Even after telling various people (the PE instructor for the course on Canvas, the FPOP feedback form, etc.) about this horrible experience, I got no response from them. s\\^3 ignored me when I asked to talk to the course instructors after the program and my advisor said she'll process it but never responses after that.\n\n'27ers, please heed this post. Don't choose this FPOP. Let me know if you have any questions via reddit DM. See y'all soon on campus.",

I love camping but this experience sounds like a nightmare. No matter how \u201creal\u201d it is, no one likes to be ignored by their camp counselors, held hostage, and prevented from contacting the outside world. Just cuz you might\u2019ve loved it doesn\u2019t mean that OP is a POS for hating it. You say you care about mental health and yet are invalidating your classmate\u2019s very traumatic experience. :/",

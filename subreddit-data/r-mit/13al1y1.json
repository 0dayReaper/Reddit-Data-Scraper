    "postText": "Yes, I know that there is a grad rat. And yes, I know that not all grad students have a set graduation date. But for those who know when they are graduating, some might want buy a brass rat to commemorate their class year. \n\nGiven that one of our admissions essays is about inclusivity, I was surprised when other grad students told me to not get a brass rat because the undergrads don\u2019t want grad students wearing them. \n\nAren\u2019t we all part of the same school?\n\nI asked a few people and couldn\u2019t get a straight answer. Im hoping that with the anonymity or reddit people would feel more comfortable to speak what they really feel about this subject. \n\nPlease help me understand your points of view. Thanks!\n\nUpdate:Reply:\n\nThank you for everyone\u2019s responses. I appreciate your insights and and candor.\n\nTo answer some of the questions posed:\n\n-\tThe reason I wanted a brass rat is because I liked the design. I think it looks better than the grad rat. I also like how it\u2019s different per class year so it\u2019s a special commemoration of that year - there will be no other ring with the same design. Grad rats only get changed every 5 years.\n-\tWe initially thought that brass rats were an MIT ring, not an undergrad ring, but that undergrads just didn\u2019t want to share. Now I understand that it\u2019s not really that. And I suppose I would also wonder why an undergrad would buy a grad rat. Though I wouldn\u2019t really care if they did.\n\nNow I wonder why didn\u2019t the brass rat just expand it\u2019s coverage to include everyone and why the GSC felt the need to make a separate ring for grad. Oh well.",

If a grad student had told me they were getting a brass rat I probably would\u2019ve been confused - not angry or annoyed, just incredulous at why a grad student would go for the undergrad ring.\n\nI don\u2019t specifically know of some animosity between undergrad and grad students with respect to rings.  If such a thing exists perhaps it developed after I graduated, but it does indeed sound like a weird thing for anyone to care about.",

In that class, only undergrads had to attend lab sections and writeup these really detailed experiments that would take 12hrs a week on top of extra pset questions, so Im sure she was just already frustrated. When a grad student started talking about getting a brass rat, she ranted about the work, pressure, and community that the grad students didn't participate in to \"earn\" it. Again, I really can't say I've ever cared much, but that was a take I saw someone espousing",

Can you actually tell the difference between the two side by side?\n\nThe graduate ring has grad school designs for the degree with department shanks that aren't available to undergrads. As I understand it, the top side design is the same otherwise for undergraduates and graduates? And you can't order a ring without a known graduation year, since that's an integral part of the design.",

It\u2019s hard to see that when you\u2019ve only had 20ish years on this earth, ~18 of them spent mostly cultivating yourself to get into MIT or as a larva.",

I think a lot of undergrads see the brass rat as something you earn for going through MIT undergrad not a tokin saying you graduate in that year.

I personally think anyone who isn't in that class year should be allowed to purchase the ring for that year but that's just me.\n\nI'm an old alumni so of course the impression on campus by current undergrads could have changed.",

In my own opinion, the brass rat is special for those who have gone through the MIT undergrad experience together.  And the grad rat is special for those who went through the grad experience.\n\nTbh even for the grad rat, some of my classmates didn't care about getting one.  It's just a ring, after all.

The survey had a question about entering the second round of the lottery which said it was only to be used to send an email reminder about it, but I never got an email about the second lottery so not sure if I should wait or go ahead and fill it out (maybe I should've put \"no\" on this question since now I feel like it impacted my odds lol and $30 makes a difference to me).",

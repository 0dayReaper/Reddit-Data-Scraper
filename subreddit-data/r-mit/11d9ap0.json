It helped a lot to read before class for the 10 and 5 classes I had to take. For example, me and the friends who read the textbook before 5.12 really enjoyed the class while the people who only went to lecture and recitation struggled.",

            "comment": "Everyone has a different style of learning, so nothing applies to everyone. That said, I'd say the vast majority of students don't have the time to do class outside of class other than doing psets/labs/projects. \n\nClasses that require you to read the textbook (require also as in a sense that the lecture is not enough or not done well enough), if there is one (and ofter there isn't for non-intro classes), usually have bad reputations and students struggle through them (whether it be because they don't have time to read the textbook or because even the textbook can't save them from a terrible professor). If a class requires readings before the lecture, it's usually redundant to the lecture and annoying (khm 6.031 khm). Anyway, it's usually seen as redundant/annoying/annoyingly necessary/time-wasting additional work.\n\nBut as I said, everyone is different. I have a friend who enjoys reading textbooks at the end of the day to better understand and digest the material from lectures. Most of my friends and I do readings (mostly class notes because usually there is no textbook) while doing psets/labs if there are concepts we forgot/didn't understand/need a deeper understanding of for the assignment.\n\nPersonally, I dislike any additional reading I need to do to *understand* the material (but I like looking up things I found interesting and reading more about them if I have time).",

I didn\u2019t apply to MIT, but I really like the OCW program, and I\u2019m trying to learn classical mechanics. \n\n\nI just had one more question, do you usually do all the homework and are they graded? Also, my course said to watch something called PiVot videos.",

                            "comment": "Yes, psets and labs are a large portion of the grade and also necessary for understanding the class material. For example, a standard 12-unit class with 3 units of lecture has 3 hours of lectures and *should* have 9 hours of \"homework\" (labs or psets) per week, though more often than not homework takes longer than what is predicted by the units (I've taken quite a few classes that are notorious for being 12 units but having 20+ hours of work outside of lecture). \n\nNot sure what PiVot videos are, but good luck with classical mechanics!",

(Lewin's videos were scrubbed as part of MIT dumping him due to serial sexual harassment issues.)\n\n... actually, a quick search on YouTube tells me that Lewin's videos are still there. I have a lot of mixed feelings about that, since his videos got me through 8.01 &amp; 8.02, but his behavior with women (including jokes I heard in class) was unacceptable.",

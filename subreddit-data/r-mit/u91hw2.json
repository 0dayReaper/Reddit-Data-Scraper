    "postText": "Hello all! If this post does not fit here, please feel free to remove it.\n\nI am a rising senior accepted into MOSTEC and my state's (Georgia) Governor's Honors Program (GHP). GHP is a 4-week residential summer program where students apply in a specific subject area called their \"major\". At GHP, students take courses on their major (not for a grade, but as an introduction to a specific topic), participate in community building activities with other GHP students, and overall get introduced to college life. I'm having trouble with what to choose and wanted to know if anybody here could give some input? \n\nI got the schedule for both programs and the daily required class times do not overlap. I know it would probably not be feasible for me to do both at the same time, but I've seen another Reddit thread say that MOSTEC is not as big of a time commitment as one might think. Is this true? What is the time commitment actually like? \n\nAny and all feedback on my situation is welcome, thank you so much for your time!",

The majority of the people I know who did GHP also went to T20 schools. This is definitely correlation and not causation, though \u2014 they were hard workers to begin with. These friends also told me that they had a lot to do everyday, regardless of their major not taking up too much time. You don\u2019t want to miss out on the experience of the entire program by doing other work during your free time. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have too much free time anyways. \n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m not familiar with MOSTEC at all, so I can\u2019t advise you with that. All I can say is that GHP is a great experience from what I\u2019ve heard, and also to not choose depending on what you think will increase your chances of getting into a school. Choose based on which experience you\u2019d enjoy more. Good luck and feel free to pm with questions!",

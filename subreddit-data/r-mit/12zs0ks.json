Just want to study something you find interesting?\n\nThe two majors probably require similar skills/core competencies which would broadly be related to using a quantitative lens to study real world phenomena in a market-based environment. I majored in 14-1 and didn\u2019t find it as challenging as I would have other majors, like 18. However, some people have a really hard time with economic reasoning (it\u2019s somewhat peculiar), so you\u2019ll just have to find out for yourself.",

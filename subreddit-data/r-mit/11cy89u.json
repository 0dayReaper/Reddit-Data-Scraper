I highly recommend that he get fitted by a jeweler if you don\u2019t know it, because the rings are a real pain to get resized.\n\nYou will also need to know the bezel size - small, medium, large, etc. I measured the bezel on my spare ring with calipers and chose the closest size, which somehow ended up being larger than what I\u2019d had. So I don\u2019t know the right way to do it, but be warned that their listed face sizes do not exactly match what you get. Maybe there\u2019s a different standard for measuring jewelry. \n\nI assume you know if his ring was gold or silver-colored (usually some alloy like celestrium). Iirc there may be a few options on what karat of gold. Finally, there\u2019s a choice to get your name engraved inside, in either script or print.",

Abbott is an Exeter and Harvard legacy who spends his time complaining that *non-white people* are the ones getting a leg up.\n\nHeight of hypocrisy. \n\nI love how the group essentially said that none of the donation is going to go to actual active engagement, but instead it's all for administrative and overhead, most importantly, as usual, CEO payment. \n\nCan't make this shit up.",

But also opportunity to take classes at MIT, not degree enrollment though.\n\nJohn Hopkins Applied Research Laboratory:\n\n92000 a year\n\nopportunity to enroll and complete masters at John Hopkins University for free without commitment. I would be also automatically accepted into their program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a recent graduate from Florida International University in Computer Engineering. I would like to complete a masters degree while working, this is important to me. The idea of having the chance of taking classes at MIT is really appealing to me since it was my dream school. However, I am having doubts since 133000 or a free degree is nice. Any comments would be appreciated.",

This is very different from JHU itself.\n\nDo you know how much tuition assistance? With a 40k differential in salary, it seems possible that you could take the tuition assistance + save up money and come up ahead, but on the other hand you would be losing on the potential salary for the years you are doing the Master's unless you are doing it part-time. Plus avoiding the headache of having to apply to programs is a huge plus.\n\nDo you have a preference in terms of the type of work you would be doing at each, or is this a lower priority for you?\n\nThe opportunity to just take classes at MIT doesn't seem like a big plus. There's nothing inherently magical about the classes at MIT - they are probably taught at a higher difficulty than other schools, but it's not as if the teaching quality itself is necessarily any better. People don't go to big-name schools just for the classes - they also go for the resources and the people they meet.",

But if you're already coming from money and just want prestige that's going to lead to a different decision than if you don't and don't want to be in debt and want to lead a good financially solid life.

But for what's it's worth - cambridge/boston area is some of the worst housing in the country, probably up there with california which would make - as others have said - Johns Hopkins the winner to many of us.  I mean - horrible here.  Worst place I've lived in.  Prices way out of control, many slumlords, tons of fires recently because the houses are just trash yet somehow 3K+ now, transit system constantly on fire.  Cambridge/Somerville even at 116K can be tough to live on now if you want housing for you and your mom.  I've seen single rooms with 5 roommates asking for over 1000- closer to 2K.  I've lived in NYC, this is way worse.  Plus, you'd be indentured to Lincoln Labs if you take their offer and use the education benefit.  \n\nAnd if your mama wants you to get an education - that's also guaranteed with Johns Hopkins.\n\nSo data points say JH.  Do with that what you will.",

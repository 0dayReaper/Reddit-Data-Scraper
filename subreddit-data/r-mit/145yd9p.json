    "postText": "How do the various technical positions at MIT Lincoln Laboratory rank? \n\nResearching Glassdoor, I've seen Assistant Staff, Associate Staff, and Technical Staff. Are there any others? Are these positions different than those which add \"Member of\" in front of them (i.e., Member of Technical Staff vs. Technical Staff).",

            "comment": "Assistant Staff means hired straight out of BS. Associate means hired with MS or a few years of experience. Technical Staff means hired right after a PhD or with a MS + experience. It is possible though to get promoted internally due to excellent performance over many years, so there are Technical Staff who joined as Assistant Staff or Associate Staff and got promoted. (Plus there are scholarship programs for staff to get a degree while employed and then get auto-promoted.)",

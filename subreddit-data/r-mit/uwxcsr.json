    "postText": "Hey yall! Housing apps just opened and I have a million and a half questions about which dorm to pick. ATM I\u2019m between Baker, New House, and New Vassar, but I just found out about BC and it sounds really cool. \n\nI\u2019ve heard all the dorms are \u201cgood\u201d it just depends on what you\u2019re looking for, so here\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for: I\u2019m a super social person, and I\u2019m looking for a dorm that has a pretty social culture. I know Baker is pretty famous for that. I also would rather have a double (ig who wouldn\u2019t). I was thinking about putting Baker first, but the new facilities in New House and New Vassar are pretty attractive. Also, I have no idea what BC culture was like/will be like. Does anyone have any advice or insight? Thank you in advance :)",

            "comment": "Honestly, don't put too much stock as to what you can ascertain about dorm culture right now. You'll go through REX and re-evaluate everything you're saying right now!\n\nYou should focus on getting into a dorm that has a high rate of applications post-REX, or in other words, dorms that other people like a lot, so Simmons, BC, NH, &amp; MacG. And don't put down EC, New Vassar, or a numbered NH house (though NH's rep may have changed recently). This ensures that post-REX, there's going to be someone who will want to take your spot once you realize you like a different dorm!\n\nIf you don't want to game the system, because honestly this strategy, while effective, is in bad faith, then my two cents are don't worry about the social scene: I lived in a cultural house in NH and yet even while in a semi-cult a lot of my friends were in other dorms. If you like parties and people, you'll find it anywhere, so as long as you like the amenities &amp; general vibe from the i3 vids and REX, then you'll be happy!\n\nEDIT: be sure to check out historic i3 vids on Vimeo &amp; YouTube as well! It's a fun rabbit hole.",

The dorm system was so hyped, so lauded etc... We were really fooled into thinking this \"culture\" stuff was going to be sick a unique living experience.\n\nNope. It was just like his 4 older siblings dorm experiences. It's just backdrop, basically.",

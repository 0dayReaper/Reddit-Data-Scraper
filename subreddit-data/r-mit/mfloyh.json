    "postText": "So, what does Marvel claim he majored in? I've looked online and it appears he majored in Engineering and Physics (Electrical Engineering to be specific). But even Marvel changes up their story between the movies and comics, but usually revolves around the theme of Engineering.\n\nNow, to be Tony Stark, in terms of building the suit and Jarvis all that, what major would someone need? Electrical Engineering? I was thinking Electrical/Mechanical Engineering, maybe EECS? It's probably got to be more than two majors, but if you had to just choose two majors to become as close as possible to Tony Stark, which would you choose and why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I don't want to be Tony Stark, rather I'm prob just gonna do Math in MIT or Columbia or CMU (still deciding cuz I'm a high school senior), but I'm just really curious :)",

                    "comment": "The main enabling feature of the suit is the ARC reactor. If a government had an energy source like that many features of the suit would be possible with today's technology. Excluding the really absurd stuff physics breaking stuff like rapid changes in velocity from impacts that should crush Tony.\n\nHe builds the ARC reactor with no computers and very limited tools. This suggests he has a very strong background in physics, although he may have acquired it outside of the school.\n\nIt is unclear to me how much of the rest of the suit is computer designed or borrowed from other projects. For instance the material science aspects of the suit's armor were taken from a Stark military satellite project. How much of the mechanical engineering is done by Jarvis?",

It seems more likely that JARVIS builds on a long term mega scale research and development effort. So perhaps the answer is to inherit an ultra powerful company which has mostly figured out Artificial General Intelligence?",

            "comment": "To a certain extent, a physics education is not an engineering education, and Tony builds things.  I think Nuclear Engineering would give him the required physics to understand fusion theory, but physics would not necessarily provide the skills in building Tony exhibited across the franchise, to I vote nuclear engineering rather than physics (or in addition).  Nuke E also provides a lot of other (shallow) knowledge of materials science, mechanical engineering, rocketry, etc.  What it does not currently cover is artificial intelligence needed to create Jarvis and the autonomous suit systems (maybe it's machine learning or expert systems).  \n\nThe current record holder for the number of undergrad degrees is Tue Nguyen with five bachelors, one masters degree and a PhD in 7 years.  He arrived in the US as a boat person from Vietnam in 1979 speaking no english at the age of 19.  He had finished the 7th degree by age 26.  He worked three jobs and took up to 12 subjects per semester.

His MS and PhD were in Nuclear Engineering.  A real life example of the \"Tony Stark\" you are looking for I think.",

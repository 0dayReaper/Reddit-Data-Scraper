            "comment": "I cross-registered for a course at the Kennedy School of Government around 1979. It was Daniel Yergin on energy policy. Registration was easy then, and presumably still is in a more automated era. But you will probably need permission of the professor.\n\nThis was a graduate level course, of course. The expectations on the student were very different than at MIT. There was an enormous amount of reading to do, and it was critical reading. It was mostly in books on reserve at the library there. The expectations of analysis and writing skill were high. Much tougher than a HASS-D course. (HUM-D in my day.)\n\nI got a gentleman's B-. But I enjoyed the course a lot! The material is now part of his book \"The Prize - The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power.\" \n\nDo remember that Harvard's calendar is different from MIT, although now fall term finals are before Christmas.",

The easiest way to get there is to get a Harvard participant Id from their student center (contact Harvard for this), and then you can use it to take the M2 bus over to Harvard (technically not allowed but it works).

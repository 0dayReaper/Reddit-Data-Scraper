    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm an admitted student to the Class of 2027 and am planning on attending CPW next week (so excited!!).\n\nI was wondering what the event is like and if anyone can describe their own experiences. I will be travelling alone so I'm wondering if it's more of an informative event, or if I will be able to meet and socialize with others.\n\nedit: id love to talk to a current student about their experience at mit (PM?). there's a lot to learn about the school from online, but i think it'd be really insightful to hear directly from someone at mit",

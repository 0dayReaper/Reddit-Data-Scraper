    "postText": "Would love some input from people who actually live in the area and go to MIT! I'm searching for apartments from out of town. I plan to commute by bike to MIT 95% of the time. I'm currently looking at places in Back Bay, Beacon Hill,  Fenway, Allston, South End, Brighton, Cambridge, and Somerville. Does a 15-20 min bike commute sound reasonable, even in the winter? Is there anything I should take into consideration in these neighborhoods?",

I've found a good system is to have a bus alternative (for me it's the 85 or CT2). In the winter or on particularly rainy days I'll take the bus, and I'll bike in anything up to a solid drizzle. You just need to keep an eye I nthe weather and plan ahead. \n\nBiking in the middle of winter really isn't fun. Even in cambridge and Somerville, it's pretty common for the cities to not plow bike lanes for a few days after they plow the car lanes. I can't imagine Boston is any better.",

There\u2019s bike lanes the whole way and the only scary part is around Harvard, but you get used to it and cars aren\u2019t driving too fast. I never was brave enough to bike in winter due to the huge snow piles and cold. I would just take the T in the winter.",

I used to live in Winter Hill in Somerville and it was too hilly for me to enjoy bike commuting, so watch out there -- most of the rest of Cambridge and Somerville is easily bikable to MIT, but look at the elevation gain/loss of your bike route (and ideally bike to and from campus at least once) before signing a lease.\n\nI agree that having a good transit option is important. I live about half a mile from the Porter T, so I take the T sometimes, but only when the weather is really bad in the winter (like, giant piles of snow in the bike lane bad). I bike the rest of the time, including rainy days and cold days in the winter.\n\nIf you're like me and plan to bike 95% of the time, I would invest in a good lightweight high-vis raincoat and rain pants for the spring and a down jacket/gloves/balaclava for your ears/face for the winter. \n\nI ride a shitty commuter bike (hybrid with gears) and I store my bike outside. Because the salt on the roads in the winter is really bad for bikes, I replace my chain (primarily due to rust) every 1-2 years, but you might do it yearly if the rust really bothers you, or less often if you're better about regular maintenance than I am or don't ride in the winter.\n\nIf you plan to ride in the winter or store your bike outside, I would recommend getting a sturdy, heavy, crappy commuter bike (but something with gears! Cambridge isn't super hilly but you will still want gears trust me) and familiarizing yourself with basic bike maintenance and simple part replacements like chain replacements and brake pad replacements, or just getting a BlueBikes membership. Anything fancy will rust out and replacing parts will be sad and expensive.",

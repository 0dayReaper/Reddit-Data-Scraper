There are certain systems that will care, like graduate admissions programs, but as far as employers hiring undergrads are concerned, it's approximately as relevant as your favorite color.\n\nWhat will actually matter are the things you learned, the people you met, and the things you discovered about yourself that cause you to choose certain paths in life. So go get those B's.",

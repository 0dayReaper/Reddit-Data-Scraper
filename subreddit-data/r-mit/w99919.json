    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nSo excited to be a part of MIT for the next four years! \n\nI wanted to get some information about how \"difficult\" the chemistry ASE truly is (I understand that this may be highly opinionated). Previous reddit threads from years back indicate that chemistry is one of the harder if not hardest ASE, but I was wondering if this still holds true recently, and if it is reasonably doable to pass if one studies the 5.111 MIT OCW. \n\nAny help would be awesome! Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "It's definitely way more than AP Chemistry.\n\nYou should actually practice on the 5.112 OCW materials (they're a little harder and apply Calculus if memory serves). I vaguely remember doing quite a few constants of reaction and final concentration calculations including the usual techniques and then applying the quadratic equation and also minor Calculus.\n\nI also remember vaguely Schrodinger being a minor part.\n\nAmusingly, the year I took the Chem ASE (before OCW materials were online and before the Internet was a thing), I was among the two who passed it, but my high school Honors Chemistry curriculum was pretty comparable to 5.11 (plus we got into about a third to a half of 5.12, Organic Chemistry).",

            "comment": "A broader answer, but why do you want to pass the Chem ASE?\n\n5.111 is much much more material &amp; difficulty than any AP/IB chem class out there; however, if you lock yourself in your local library and do nothing but study 5.111 for the next month, you'll probably be able to get an A on the practice finals and pass the ASE.\n\nBut is that good for your MIT career? Would you consider being a ChemE or BioE or straight chem/bio? Interested in Material Science or NuclearE? If so, doing the 5.111 or even 5.112 class your first semester would be much more valuable and a better set-up for your future classes.\n\nBut are you set on being a course 6? Or going into Sloan? Or a MechE? Then yeah, if you spend the rest of your summer studying, you could give yourself a free 12 units to do a different class, but is that how you want to spend your summer? Because even with all the studying in the world there's honestly still going to be a 50/50 chance you pass.\n\nThe philosophy of the ASEs is that if you know the material well, you should pass. But if you need to cram for the test, the test probably isn't made for you. Spend your summer doing something you're passionate about.",

I passed it a few years ago, but thought it was hard even with AP Bio knowledge since the exam covered quite a bit more than what\u2019s covered in AP Bio. The ASE is just the final exam for the course, so you could take a look at it and see how much you know already? \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good use of your time if you\u2019re just doing it because it\u2019s not relevant to your major. Maybe I\u2019m biased because I\u2019m a 7 major but 7.01x classes from what I\u2019ve heard from friends are pretty well-liked and go a lot more in depth than high school bio. At MIT you will have to take a lot more classes than just classes for your major (ex. HASS\u2019s, other GIRs), and sometimes those classes can be some of the most interesting!",

            "comment": "After taking AP Bio in HS and getting a 5, I thought the MIT Bio ASE was actually surprisingly easy. Felt similar to how the AP Bio test is, where it\u2019s sometimes more about reading comprehension than knowledge. For reference, I passed all ASEs besides Chem (tried and failed) and am mostly a B student at MIT with some As here and there. Maybe you could study AP Bio material, take those practice tests?\n\nI know some people dont think ASEs are worth your time. I sort of do and dont agree. I think the social connections you make as a first year in GIRs is huge, and you really shouldn\u2019t just ASE everything then overload your first semester so much that you can\u2019t make friends. At the same time, I\u2019m really glad that I don\u2019t have to take bio as someone not majoring near it. The classes are great, I\u2019m sure. Bio is cool. But you only get to MIT once, and if you can reasonably skip it then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so bad (just please dont take 4 hard ass technicals in your first semester! Seriously!)",

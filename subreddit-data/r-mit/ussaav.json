    "postText": "I'm in a dire situation. My urban studies paper is due tomorrow, and there's this one book that will really help wrap my paper up. Problem is, I can't access this book with my instituition's login info. I've also tried finding the book elsewhere for free, but I cannot find it. My only other option is paying like \\~$26 for access, but I'm not willing on giving up yet. I was hoping someone here could unlock it for me and send it to me. It would be nice ;-;\n\nAnyways, here's the link [https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315149158-3/urban-safety-crime-prevention-cyntia-l\u00f3pez-rueda-luna-cara](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315149158-3/urban-safety-crime-prevention-cyntia-l\u00f3pez-rueda-luna-cara)\n\nThanks in advance",

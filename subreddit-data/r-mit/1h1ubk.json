The website was completely unprotected (open to editing by anyone with an internet connection), the messages put on the site were predictable and often repetitive, and it elicited an even sillier response from the target (\"Terms of Surrender\" in an open-edit Google document?). I really don't think this should have made as big a splash as it did. Surely, we can do better.",

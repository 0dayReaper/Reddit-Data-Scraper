    "postText": "Really struggling to decide between these two.  I want to start paving my way into ML, so Linear Algebra should be a good start. But should I go for pure Linear Algebra or Linear Algebra and Optimization (18.C06)?  18.C06 seems to fit more into what I want to do but it also sounds like a harder class from what I'm seeing on course evaluations site. Preferably would like to hear from people who have taken either of these classes. Thanks.",

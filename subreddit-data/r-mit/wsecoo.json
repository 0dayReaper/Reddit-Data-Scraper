    "postText": "Hi everybody,\n\nI am a new graduate student and trying to find classes to take for this semester. I was interested in taking 6.7900 (looks like it was formerly listed as 6.867) because my research will involve some machine learning, but I was wondering if anybody here had taken it and could comment on the class, i.e. workload, assumed background, etc. I have done a very small amount of actual machine learning (think basic sklearn) but do have a good amount of probability/statistics background.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Depends on what you want to get out of the class. The lectures are very tough and it assumes you have quite a bit of background already. If this is your first time doing any ML (eg have no large experience with neural nets, transformers, generative models, etc) you will struggle, although I also took the class at pretty much this position. I think I understood maybe 50% of the material at the time and only understood everything a year later. The material is super dense so they will expect you to learn some things on your own (eg read papers, etc) but thats all up to you. The homework is not that bad since there are only 3 psets which can be quite tough, but again not that many. The exercises are all optional, but definitely worth doing. And the project is open-ended so you can do kind of whatever the hell you want. The grading scheme is also quite lenient (I think over half the class got an A), so overall, Id say workload isnt horrible although understanding everything is a monumental task if you have no background. But if you put more time into it, you will learn more and the other way around.",

            "comment": "It's been a few years since I've taken it and it changes quite a bit year to year, so take that into account. My experience was that it is taught at an introductory graduate level. Meaning that the lectures start from scratch and do not assume much prior knowledge (other than general concepts like classification vs regression, over/under-fitting, etc.). However, since it is a graduate level course, it does require some level of mathematical/coding maturity (linear algebra, probability, calculus), is somewhat fast-paced, and expects you to learn a lot of the details of the material on your own. That said, if your research will involve machine learning, then I highly recommend taking this class, unless there is another class that is more specific to the techniques you will be using.",

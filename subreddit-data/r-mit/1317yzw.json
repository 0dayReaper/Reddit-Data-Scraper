    "postText": "Hey :)) are there any law school admits/students/graudates that did their undergrad from MIT and could share a bit about what their GPAs looked like? This school is killing me and I don't know if getting in to a good law school is a possibility since all of the average GPAs are like 4.9s, but a Harvard history major would probably have an easier time getting As than an MIT CS major right?",

That probably doesn\u2019t mean much for today\u2019s law school admissions chances though. \n\nAt the time MIT didn\u2019t have anyone on staff who knew anything about law school admissions - there was someone who did premed advising who tried their best, but for the 2-3 of us who wanted law school it wasn\u2019t worth her time to be an expert. I doubt that has changed.\n\nDo you know what you want to do with a JD? In my experience (15 years in corporate law) there are only one or two career paths where the JD track is more appealing than a related path on the business side - many of which you can do with just an SB, not even an MBA or masters/PhD.",

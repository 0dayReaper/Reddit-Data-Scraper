    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI've just got a 3 share room in Ashdown building during self selection period yesterday, so happy to live in there. One thing that i'm now nervous little is my family may come to Cambridge before expiration date of the room, so I may inevitably move out early. Maybe we're gonna live in off-campus housing, and in that case, I want you to give me some advice or share your experience. \n\n1. you think would I get approved terminations?  I just wonder if my case would be related with change in family status. \n2. is there any chance that someone will live in my room after i leave? (maybe from IAP period)   \nIf my case is subject to unapproved terminations, I know that before next student come in the room I have to pay all relevant rent fee during entire contact period. Then, I should find a person who want to live in Ashdown.",

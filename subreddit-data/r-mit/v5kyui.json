I haven't made any close friends or even very many acquaintances, haven't joined any clubs, haven't interacted closely with many professors (only 1), and generally still feel like an outsider to the community. \n\nNow that I am a rising senior, I feel like I've run out of time. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can make the most out of my senior year given these circumstances?",

It's a little hard to just make friends simply by deciding to, but some of the others are 100% things you can decide to do and just go do: for example you can join clubs and pick a professor whose class you're taking that you'd like to connect with and attend office hours to talk to them more or try a UROP. Do undergrad dorms have events that need volunteers? In the graduate housing there are often events that require a lot of people to do mundane things like cut fruit, and it's a good chance to talk with others. It's not awkward because even if the conversation lulls you can just stand next to each other cutting fruit, but it also doesn't require any thinking so it's easy to just chat while you do it. I don't know if undergrad housing has similar events or if covid has put an end to communal preparation of food, but I wonder if there are any similar volunteer opportunities that would allow you to interact with some people.",

It's a great forcing function to get out there and be with people, and gives you a huge community overnight. I know the reddit hivemind hates greek life for some reason but the stigma about greek life is overblown at MIT. It only did positive things for my life at MIT",

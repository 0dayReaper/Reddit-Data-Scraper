I suppose they could be opened up again during business hours for buildings open to the public but I guess they don't care enough to go lock and unlock them every night and morning.",

I assume only normal doors really worked with this system so they locked all the revolving doors. It's been almost 3 years at this point and I assume it's just not a high priority going out and fixing them all.\n\nAlthough, they just switched to open campus a couple months ago, so they may fix them soon.",

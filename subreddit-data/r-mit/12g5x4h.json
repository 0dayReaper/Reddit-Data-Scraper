If you can financially swing it, I\u2019d avoid the 9/1 lease cycle, as literally 75% of leases are on that cycle (including most student leases), so moving on / around that date is a huge headache. \n\nIn terms of where people live, I\u2019d say Cambridgeport, Porter Square, Davis Square, Inman Square, and Union Square are the big areas MIT people live around. Kendall is too expensive unless you\u2019re very wealthy, and Central doesn\u2019t have a ton of housing. And forget about living near Harvard Square unless you, again, are independently wealthy.\n\nPlan to pay a lot and to live with roommates. If you can get a 2BR for less than $3000/month, that\u2019s a great deal and you should take it. There is generally just not enough housing in the greater Boston area to meet demand. On campus housing might be a better / cheaper option overall.",

Otherwise, going to the Harvard-MIT housing Facebook group is a good idea.\n\nOther resources (some friends have used them with varying degrees of success):\n\nhttp://www.apartments.com \n\n[http://www.padmapper.com](http://www.padmapper.com)\n\n[craigslist.com/boston](https://craigslist.com/boston)\n\nI personally think that the Facebook group is the easiest to work with if you want to live in a shared situation.  As someone else pointed out, there's are peak leasing cycles to be aware of (when classes end in the summer, and when classes start in the fall).  A bunch of posts will appear for those times, but a lot of people will also be looking at around those times.",

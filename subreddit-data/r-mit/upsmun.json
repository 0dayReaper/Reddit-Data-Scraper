I\u2019ve taken single and multi variable calculus (and other classes but those are the most relevant to physics) and I usually prefer doing problems to doing labs because I like things with more math and less experimentation. \n\nWhich physics class would probably be a better choice for me to take next year? And how much harder is 8.012 than 8.01?",

I never was a physics major. 8.022 was the best class I ever took at MIT, in part because the class is very well designed and very well taught. Yes, it is a huge increase in difficulty from regular 8.02, but I never had any problem getting good grades. If you're the kind of student who thrives on difficulty (and I don't mean by high school standards, I mean by MIT standards), then 8.0x2 is worth it even if you're not a physics major. It changes your understanding of the universe. Otherwise, yeah, don't bother, you need that time for other stuff.",

It made 8.01 an entire cakewalk, since what we covered in 5 weeks in 8.012 was practically the focus of the whole semester of 8.01. It\u2019s definitely more rigorous and requires more effort. You\u2019ll learn a lot more theoretical (and practical) information which is overall pretty cool. I know some people who preferred 8.012 because they couldn\u2019t stand the TEAL format of 8.01, but that\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to see whether you like or not. \n\nTo be fair, my experience might not be accurate since it was virtual lol and I only had AP Physics Mechanics C preparing me for this. But if you end up finding it difficult, the switch is easy to make. I found I liked 8.01 a lot more since I didn\u2019t have to spend as much time teaching myself the physics. I\u2019ve also heard that even if you want to be a physics major this will not be the end-all-be-all class for it.\n\nEdit: for math major lol 8.01. Make your life a lil easier and enjoy the first semester :,)",

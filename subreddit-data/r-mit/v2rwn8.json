As well other events like board game nights, movies, outings.\n\nAdditionally, helping out for prep at the events is a great way to interact with other students and get to know them. I highly recommend helping out at some events.",

The monthly brunches are an amazing way to meet folks. \n\nSid Pac has something similar, but I don\u2019t know much of its social activities. I do know that Sid Pac folks I\u2019ve met have been chill af tho",

            "comment": "I lived at Ashdown (pre-COVID) and highly recommend it.\n\nPersonally I didn't make many new friendships at Ashdown.  I made a lot of friends from within my degree program -- who also happen to live at Ashdown (or nearby at SP, etc.)  Then I ended up meeting their friends, etc.\n\nWhile I was there, Ashdown had a no-alcohol policy for common spaces, but we had our own pub/bar (Thirsty Ear) in the complex.    When we wanted to party however we ended up going to one of the other dorms that allowed alcohol in their shared spaces.\n\nI had a single \"efficiency\" apartment but if you end up in a Double or Triple apartment / suite then hopefully you'll also get along with your roomies and meet new friends that way.",

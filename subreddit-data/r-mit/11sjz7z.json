    "postText": "I'm a course 6 senior planning to graduate this spring.\n\nI got an F my sophomore year in a course 6 class. I had a slew of problems (messy breakup with a toxic ex, depression, etc).\n\nI dreamt of going to grad school and getting a PhD. So I was really scared of how this F affected my GPA and if I had already thrown this future away because of my stupidity and weakness.\n\nI'm a senior now and no longer talk about grad school whenever people ask me what my plans are for grad school. I didn't apply to anything either.\n\nWhen I saw the F on my transcript, I remember searching hours upon hours online on grad school forums and this piazza page to see if there's a chance for someone like me. I told myself it's okay, I'll retake the class, get an A, do well in all my other classes-it was just a one-time thing.\n\nExcept no, in the following semesters got 2 Cs, a bunch of Bs, and only a couple As in course 6 classes. I only finished at a B in that class I got the F in.\n\nI feel like a failure. Maybe I'm not cut out for this. Maybe I'm not smart enough to go to grad school.\n\nI know there's a lot of options for me. Maybe the course 6 MEng program would accept me based on my UROP experience despite not meeting GPA cutline.\n\nI could work in industry and still get a masters, do well in that, and prove to PhD programs that I can succeed as a researcher. No problem. I might take a couple more years than my friends who are flying all around the country for grad school visit weekends right now, but this is my life and I need to accept that and love myself. Comparing myself to others brings no good.\n\nToday my mom asked me about my GPA for the first time out of the blue. She then asked me \"can u get into grad school with that?\"\n\nShe didn't mean harm. She never went to college; she was genuinely curious and worried if I can still achieve my childhood dream of becoming a professor.\n\nI don't even remember what I told her. I just had tears streaming down my face, then I hung up on her. And here I am now. I don't know what to do.\n\nI wish I can go back to the past and start over. I have a pset due tomorrow morning, but I can't even focus on that. I'm depressed, I'm burnt out. I don't even know if I have the energy to barely pass my classes and make it to graduation. What's the point? I came all the way to this school, spent so much time, money, effort...destroyed my mental and physical health in the process. I didn't do all this just to barely get a diploma. I wanted to be good at something. I wanted to do good research and I wanted to stand at a lectern at a prestigious university. All of this seems so far away. It's even worse because I definitely could've done it. I just blew my chances.\n\nHas anyone in a situation like this ever succeeded in academia? Or would I be the first if I ever did?\n\nYes I love the people I met at this school. Love the friends and connections I made. Maybe one day I'll love all the pain I felt and feel, too. But today is not the day. Wise people, please drop some advice for me below. I would appreciate it so much.\n\nSorry about the extremely long post. I just had so much to get off my chest. I am not ok.",

I hope you find some peace and get some sleep tonight (call S\\^3 and get late days for your pset maybe?)\n\nI'm an undergrad myself so I can't say anything about grad school, but I know that our lives are long and we have decades left to live. Your time at MIT will not be the only thing to define you. There's so much time left in your life to learn whatever you want. One day I believe you'll find yourself confident and ready for a grad program. There's so many paths you can take. If you decide you'd rather pursue another career path than a professorship along the way, so be it.\n\nI'm rooting for you, OP. I'm hoping there's other folks on this subreddit who can give you more substantial advice.",

Many people do a phd just because they want to be defined as successful, yet the definition of success is very diverse when you get out of school.

There is certainly no definition of what is successful. It is up to you to figure out what makes you happy. \n\nIf you don't actually like academia, (I can see it is destroying op's life) then SIMPLY don't do it. In the most scenario, PhD is a waste of time, you can simply check this, just Google it.",

It\u2019s less stressful than being a full-time professor; you get the benefit of inspiring students and the resume boost, but don\u2019t have the pressures (e.g. publishing lots of papers for the sake of it) that often come with academia.\n\nWhile there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to pursue academia, I do notice that people who dream of a singular \u201cdo or die\u201d goal during childhood almost always set themselves up for disappointment down the road. Like it\u2019s good to dream, but it\u2019s also good to be flexible, forgive yourself, and be open to realistically doing plan B, C, D, etc. Very few people achieve plan A. Many discover paths that are just as great if not greater than their original plans. Just some food for thought.",

Chill out if you can, finish the pset, take care of the immediate demands, then you can worry about the big story.\n\nSecond:\n\n&gt;I could work in industry and still get a masters, do well in that, and prove to PhD programs that I can succeed as a researcher. No problem. I might take a couple more years than my friends who are flying all around the country for grad school visit weekends right now, but this is my life and I need to accept that and love myself. Comparing myself to others brings no good.\n\nThis is where I would have told my life story, which matches the above to some degree. Had a helluva lot of fun my first years, chasing skirts and generally partying. Realized senior year that I needed to knuckle down and get cracking on grades, and grad school wasn't immediately in the cards. Was fortunate and found a job at MIT Lincoln Lab, told my future boss at the interview that I wasn't staying long term and wanted to go to grad school. He loved the response and realized I was motivated as hell.  He was from Caltech, and basically took me under his wing - I learned a lot from him. MIT LL also had tuition reimbursement of 100% for classes at MIT (don't know the current policy), which meant I was taking grad courses (and nailing the grades) plus introducing myself to the profs as a potential new researcher in their group.\n\nIt worked, I went back to grad school after 3 years. While I might have small regrets about not acing classes in my early years, upon further reflection, it enabled me to be where I am today. You learn a lot in those times, and learning about people doesn't earn grades but the life experience pays off.\n\nI wish you good luck in any case.\n\nEdit: $0.02 - As another poster said, call your mom and patch things by telling her you were just upset, not with her. Odds are she already knows (moms are like that) but it's good to hear it out loud. And I have a feeling you will thank yourself for doing so in your later years.",

CVS and Walgreens are all booked up at this point, and MIT Medical also doesn't have any appointments as far as I can tell. If anyone has any insight or thoughts on this, it would be much appreciated.",

Book the soonest CVS/Walgreens appt you can find, and if someone contacts you about not having your shot, let them know.\n\nAlso worth checking if Cambridge, Somerville, or Boston are offering flu shots to the community at any point.",

There's no shortage of doses; their online schedules are just to try to keep too many people from arriving at the same time, but they'll happily give you a shot without an appointment as long as you don't arrive when the store is mobbed. At this point in the year the big rush for flu shots is pretty much over, so just try to go at an off-peak time of day and you shouldn't have a problem.",

    "postText": "Hi y'all,\n\nI'm a Harvard student and am in the process of cross-registering for 6.390(0) for this upcoming semester. In light of this, I had a few questions that would be useful to know, or even just to know whom I can ask:\n\n- **What is the most efficient way of commuting?** Obviously the Red Line exists, but I don't have much money and would really rather not drop the 360$ required for a full semester's worth of monthly passes. Is the M2 shuttle still a thing? Would you suggest a BlueBike even in the winter? Also, I estimate about a 30min commute both ways. Is this accurate?\n\n-  **Would I be able to eat at MIT?** One of the lecture times that fits in best with my schedule is the 11-12:30 one, and I'd ideally like to be able to eat before commuting back, but this obviously isn't a priority. \n\n- **Is there any difference between buildings?** I have the option to take classes in either Building 32 (room 044) or 34 (room 501). Is there any difference in terms of the experience I'll have? Are classes in one building better equipped, or do they work better for lectures or something?\n\n- **Is there somewhere I can meet MIT students beforehand?** I was thinking perhaps there'd be a public side of MIT's Discord server, or some other community (online or not) that I could join in order to start knowing people, forming a PSET group, etc. \n\nI know these are a lot of questions so thank you in advance, and feel free to DM me or otherwise for any reason.",

            "comment": "1. The M2 shuttle is my preferred way of commuting and has been pretty reliable in my experience. The #1 bus also exist and runs the same route which can serve as a very convenient backup. Takes ~15 minutes each way on the bus/ T. Biking is personably feasible in the winter when it\u2019s not actively precipitating. It\u2019ll also get you the closest to the buildings you need to go to (but it\u2019s like a 5 minute walk from the bus/ T, so not much difference).\n\n2. Yes. You can eat at the student center, Stata (Building 32), Kendall Square, dining halls, etc. You can just pay cash at any of those places.\n\n3. Unsure on the exact rooms but the buildings are next to each other. The elevator in Building 34 is a bit slow lol.\n\n4. A discord was made during COVID, but is not very active. Someone will probably make a Messenger group for the class, and you can ask to join using the class Piazza or something. None of this will happen until probably the week before class starts at the absolute earliest though.",

                    "comment": "seconding M2, I'd usually pick between M2, 1, or red line based on what Transit and TransLoc would indicate as the fastest. Honestly I'd say the buses take closer to 10 mins in my experience, it's pretty quick.",

There are many places to lock your bike at MIT. There\u2019s a big bike rack at building 24 which is close to where you will be. \n\nAlso all the places listed above are good to eat at but there\u2019s also a cafe in Hayden Library.",

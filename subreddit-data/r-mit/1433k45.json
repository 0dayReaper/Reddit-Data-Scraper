            "comment": "&gt;Not much is offered at my school but I participate in the only clubs offered\n\n\nThis was like my daughter's school. But part of the reason she got into MIT is because she was able to show them that she went outside her school and proactively found other things based on her interests. \n\nFor example her school did not have Olympiad teams, so she found out that the Olympiad allowed neighboring schools to try out for other schools teams. And she did that. \n\nShe also did other things. Basically she showed them that she was dead serious and being involved in things that were within her specific interest area.\n\nSo MIT was happy to see that she made an effort to go above and beyond in her interest area.",

I really liked my lab and ended up doing my MEng with them, but that wasn\u2019t directly related to the class itself. I don\u2019t think the class was great but at least it wasn\u2019t that time consuming. I heard UAT was hard but people got a lot out of it\n\nIf you\u2019re 6-3, I assume you need UAR or UAT, plus 6.033 unless they\u2019ve changed the requirements. I was 6-2 though and I took 6.163 (strobe lab) for my other ci-m. The write ups were pretty annoying but the class wasn\u2019t difficult in a technical sense (despite the fact I\u2019m very much on the CS side of things and know little EE). I also got to learn some really cool photography techniques and got some awesome pictures out of it",

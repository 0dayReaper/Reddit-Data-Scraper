PIs cannot let an unsafe lab stay open. MIT must maintain an effective EHS staff. \n\nThis can be done correctly and safely. I worked with HF and other very nasty stuff for years in association with MIT\u2019s MTL (run by Vicky Diadiuk, around senior researchers Kurt Broderick &amp; Dennis Ward). From top to bottom, there was a no-nonsense culture of safe material handling. If you stepped near a fume hood without the appropriate PPE, you\u2019d hear about it from everyone around you, and dangerous situations were not allowed to continue.",

(As an aside, I think that while the GSU has their heart in the right place, they sometimes over-editorialize which comes off as dishonest and loses credibility.) But I think the article has some solid points that:\n\n* Medical bills due to research-related accidents should be covered by / subrogated to MIT, regardless of RA/TA/fellowship status.\n* Four grad students in a single department hospitalized due to chemical exposure within a four-month period represents a serious systemic problem, bordering on gross EHS negligence. HF exposure is particularly concerning; that should never, never happen. That's on the university admin and/or department, and it's understandable to call for collective action.",

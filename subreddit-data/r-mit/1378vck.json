            "comment": "A capacitor stores energy in the form of an electric field between its two plates; as electrons flow into one plate from one side of the circuit, an equal amount of positive charge \"flows\" to the other plate.  For lots of EE circuit elements, there's a [hydraulic analogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_analogy).  Maybe that could be helpful to you for an analogous representation of a capacitor holding charge?\n\nThere's also [Khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/circuits-topic/circuits-with-capacitors/v/capacitance), but I'd also really recommend just reaching out to your TA if you haven't already. When I was studying circuits -- or really anything in undergrad --, my TAs were really indispensable to me. Good luck!!! :)",

Not in any classes, nor in any of the activities I chose to pursue. \n\nOf course for some things you'll naturally be in some kind of opposition against someone else or many others (e.g. running for a position in your dorm council or auditioning for an a capella group), or trying to obtain some kind of limited position (e.g. a lab who can only take a certain number of UROPs), but IMO MIT is largely collaborative and not competitive unless you purposefully seek things that are competitive in nature. As far as all the classes I took are concerned, I definitely believe you can go through your four years without feeling pressure of competition against your peers.",

Eng. in course 6 which you kinda just need good enough grades to get accepted, or went to grad school elsewhere and I'm not really clear on their experience",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,  \nI'm taking a class at the MIT Media Lab. For the class project, we are running an MIT/Harvard research study using an AI companion app for stress and sleep management (called Willow). The time commitment is 1 minute a day for 3 weeks to interact with the app after a 15 minute initial eligibility and on-boarding survey. Completing the onboarding questionnaire and the study will enter you in a cash prize lottery where you can win up to $330.  \nNote: The study is currently accepting Apple Watch users only. But in the future we're expanding to other wearable devices (Oura Ring, Whoop, etc.), and users with no wearables, so if you're interested, please feel free to leave your contact info in the survey and/or download the app.  \n   \n**Please answer this survey to see if you\u2019re eligible (15 minutes):** [**https://form.typeform.com/to/ixp6V0It**](https://form.typeform.com/to/ixp6V0It) \n\nIf you're not part of the study but want to alpha test our app, feel free to download here:  [https://testflight.apple.com/join/LHzbMYBa](http://willow%20ios%20beta/)   \n\n\nThank you for your time!",

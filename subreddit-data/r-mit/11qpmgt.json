    "postText": "Hello!\n\nA bit of background: I am a current senior undergraduate that applied to MIT\u2019s MEng civil/environmental engineering program last semester. Last month, I learned about my acceptance to the program!\n\nIssue: This past semester, I have been influenced greatly by academic work due to collaboration with professors and am now very interested in possibly continuing my education after my Master\u2019s and pursuing a PhD. As I understand, the MEng degree at MIT is generally regarded as a terminal degree that prepares me for industry work (which was my initial intent but am not so sure now).\n\nMy main question is whether there are opportunities to switch degree plans prior to the admission deadline. Has anyone previously had experience or seen anything like this unfold? I know that this situation is likely highly unusual, but if anyone has any insight, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out!\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Definitely confirm this with the department, but I don't think you can switch. You'd probably have to apply to the SM program next admissions cycle. \n\nThe SM and MEng applications for Course 1 have different requirements and the programs have different capacity and funding sources. IME, admissions for the SM &amp; PhD program is much more competitive than the MEng so I imagine you they aren't going to guarantee an SM transfer to MEng admits. And anecdotally, depending on your track and research interests they also sometimes have a preference for external candidates (i.e. people not coming from MIT undergrad) in the SM/PhD program (unfortunately this is a thing in multiple MIT departments), in contrast with the MEng which is basically intended for MIT undergrads. \n\nThis is just based on my experience applying to the Course 1 PhD as an MIT undergrad, but I didn't get admitted so take this with a grain of salt. However I did consult the department about admissions stuff when I was deciding whether I should apply to the MEng or SM/PhD, and what I stated above is based on the info and impressions I got from those conversations.",

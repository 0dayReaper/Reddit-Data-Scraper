During O week alone, I got over 200 snapchats and made lots of friends. In the first few months at dal, my snapchat story views skyrocketed from ~450/day to almost 1000/day, and by the end of the school year I was nearing 1500. Go to O week events, go to parties, and make friends in res! Join group chats and get out there. Good luck :)",

Obviously im not super close with everyone Ive met. I have a relatively small friend group that I'm actually close with; basically like a solid 10 people. I just KNOW everyone &amp; everyone knows me, especially after I started throwing my own parties.",

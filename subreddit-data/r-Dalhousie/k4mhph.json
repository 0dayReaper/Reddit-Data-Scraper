    "postText": "I've been hesitating to share my thoughts on my experience as a TA in the fall of 2020, but reading the experiences of others on here was extremely validating and I think that there needs to be an actual discussion on the impact on online education. I don't have solutions at the moment, but I think there needs to be an actual look into what happened this fall, because, this model is unsustainable. This is my own experience at Dal, but from looking at what happens around the country, it seems to be a bigger problem in the academic world as a whole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I have respect and sympathy for my undergraduate students who were thrown into this situation and still managed to deliver projects, turn in assignments, ask questions and attend classes and tutorials. As the semester progressed, it became clear that there would be important limits on the work they could accomplish and thus my goal became to make sure to maximize what I could get out of the students in terms of quality of work, instead of being strict for the sake of being strict.\n2. With this in mind, my own mental health took a severe hit this fall and I will neither pursue my degree, nor will I be seeking TA opportunities in the future. The stress from students and faculty was extremely hard on my own reality as a TA and student (and human being) in the middle of a pandemic. Often, I felt as if TAs were expected to apply duct tape between students and professors and it feels as if we were forgotten somewhere along the process. I'm at peace with my decision, but I feel as if I was not able to reach my full potential as a student and a TA.\n3. Initially, I expected my role to be to grade papers and help to lead discussions. Quickly, it became obvious that I would step in and act as the only link between the professor's asynchronous lectures and the students who required a real-time connection to the academic world. Therefore, I rarely got to discuss the material with students and instead, I became a *call center* to troubleshoot the different elements of the class. With this in mind, if I find this frustrating, I can't imagine what it's like when you face these issues in each and everyone of your class. \n4. Just because we could take the current model and apply it online, it does not mean that it works. An internet connection, a computer and a collection of unrelated softwares and website does not replace the spontaneity of the academic experience in real-time. Students are all over the world, in different workspaces and it's unrealistic to think that the experience will be the same. Students, TAs, faculty... it feels as if no one received the adequate support to maximize the limited output of this model.\n5. Part of my current TA role is based on the office-hours model. This does not work and it's time to address the fact that students approach their workload in a different way. We'd like for everyone to start early, but this is not the case. Instead of putting the onus on the student, I think they need to be able to complete work when they want (before deadline) and to have the tools to succeed. To ensure this, I could not limit myself at replying to emails once a week and my life became consumed by this. Let's acknowledge once and for all that students do not fit into this one restricted vision and that they will work at different times, in different contexts and that therefore, even though they work at the last minute, they still need to access the tools to succeed. \n6. I decided that flexibility would be necessary when students approached me this fall. I also offered the same flexibility to the professors. I would like to see the same flexibility offered to TAs. I feel bad when I wasn't able to reply to an email within a day, but as I mentioned, my own mental health took a hit. I read that some students in other classes were offered the option to drop the grades of their two lowest assignments, maybe TAs could be offered to spread their work a bit more in the semester. This requires organization and planning, but I think it may help to reduce the burden.\n7. Expectations were not managed at all. Students need to know what is to be expected of them from day one (what are the elements they need to complete and when do these need to be completed AND where do they complete them). They also need to know what the TA can help with and what the TA cannot help them with. TAs need to know what tasks they can accomplish and what needs to be delegated. Finally, professors need to understand that the change in the learning environment has direct consequences on the output of both students and TA. This is NOT a perfect nor sustainable solution and therefore, it will require the model to be adapted.\n8. Communication needs to have a written trace by email to everyone. Students do not engage with the asynchronous lectures in the same way, they do not always attend the synchronous groups and classes and information is hard to find on Teams and Brightspace. There needs to be uniformity and clarity in ALL aspects of communication. Moreover, I found that many students do not check their Dalhousie emails on a regular basis and miss critical information. I think the fact that some of the tools provided are inadequate is NOT a reflection on students, but on the failures of providing them with the right tools to succeed.\n9. Finally, I hope that Dalhousie will be able to provide the resources and tools to help every student thrive and succeed in upcoming semesters. Some students at risk have not received adequate support. Students who deal with mental illness were not able to access as many resources. Even something like students who do not ask to expand on the material because they're stuck troubleshooting online tools instead.  \n\n\nThis model of applying duct-tape on a system which has many flaws is neither healthy, nor sustainable and as I mentioned, there needs to be a broad discussion on the outcome of this awkward attempt at making online education work. I wish I could provide solutions, but I think we need to trust TAs and students in providing these based on their experiences. As there are no perfect models, nor perfect solutions, I think priorities and expectations need to be managed.",

The pure asynchronous model adopted widely came from evidence that it would be better for students, but completely missed the boat on the basic need for people to relate to each other, and the collective angst of a seemingly endless pandemic. \n\nSome Faculties went for a mix of synchronous and asynchronous. I think that it worked out better, but certainly not for everyone. Maybe just \"less bad\" rather than truly \"better\".\n\nHope that a lot of learning goes into the next, and hopefully last fully online term. Many faculty did a good job under difficult conditions. I  thinks that CS is feeding back the results of the surveys and tons of listening. Your input is very much in line with what we know now. I hope that it makes a difference..",

I don't live on campus, and I'm a more mature student (mid 30s) and don't spend much of my time on campus, but I hardly see anything in respect to queer events, no real queer representation to speak of, and those who I do speak to who are also queer, don't see anything to represent them.  There's a far more substantial presence and support for international students than there is for queer folks.\n\nThere's a professor in my program (I haven't had a class with them yet, thank god) where they said they wouldn't be supporting the use of peoples pronouns, and wouldn't offer a safe space for students because \"safe spaces don't exist in the real world\".\n\nIt is no secret that Dalhousie caters to two people: Entitled/privileged  white cis men, and rich international students. \n\nI'm going to Dal because it is the only school in NS that offers the program I'm in.  Otherwise, I'd never have gone to Dal, to be honest.",

They\u2019d all go Curling together weekly, they\u2019d take over Restaurants, drag me and all my straight friends to Reflections. The friends group ten years later still gets together regularly and most have moved away. In the Maritimes at least I don\u2019t think you could find a more LBGTQ+ Friendly City than Halifax. It might not be Montreal or Vancouver, but they\u2019re totally accepting. \n\nIf you think Dalhousie Caters to Rich International Students don\u2019t ever take a Class at U of T or UBC. Professors won\u2019t even talk to you if you aren\u2019t international. Dalhousie was great for Student Interaction, I used to go for Beers with some of my Profs, I don\u2019t know many Universities you can do that anywhere in the World. Maybe it\u2019s because I went to larger Universities after Dalhousie, but it opened my eyes to how good Dalhousie is. Go to McGill or U Vic if you want a better LGBTQ+ community, but that\u2019s about all you\u2019ll find.",

I\u2019d want to be in either Risley or Howe Hall if you\u2019re a social person they\u2019re the two most happening Residences. I loved my two years in Bronson in Howe Hall to be honest, it\u2019s older, but it had great people and a fun charm to it. I found the RAs and people more down to earth than Risley. But Risley you get sinks in your rooms. Howe you don\u2019t (except Fountain). Risley is all Shared Washrooms which aren\u2019t as Big of a Deal as you think the doors are secure and go right to the floor. Howe is a mix of shared washrooms and gender specific. The two worst houses in Howe Hall are the two bedroom ones, avoid them. \n\nShirreff Hall is half Women only and a bit out of the way, so it\u2019s quieter if you want a bigger residence with a more laid back feel. The food in Shirreff was the best when I went there, people would specifically go there just to eat. \n\nGerard Hall is downtown and on the Engineering Campus, it\u2019s a tall apartment style building and fills up quick. I knew a few Engineers who lived in Howe Hall because they couldn\u2019t get into Gerard, but they didn\u2019t complain it\u2019s an easy bus ride down and back or ten minute walk.  \n\nMini Res is super quiet if you plan on having a social life don\u2019t go there. It\u2019s mostly intentional students or older people. If you want super quiet it\u2019s for you. \n\nDalhousie usually places people in clusters of people you grew up with or whose program you\u2019re in. For example Howe Hall was all people from Ontario. Whereas Risley seemed to be people from Montreal and the Maritimes.",

Any tips for me to maintain that high a gpa? Do you think that I can manage that while having a job? I don't mind quitting the job tbh. I was an A student in high school but I know that university is a whole new world.\n4. Why do some courses (Technical Communications I) end at 7:30 pm? I tried switching blocks but it was still around the same time. These timings are insane.\n\nThanks!",

Other tips: Review your notes after you\u2019re done with the lectures, ask professors if you have any questions by going to their office hours (don\u2019t be shy, they usually appreciate students that do). Make sure you do a lot of practice questions for courses like math and science.\n\n2. It is not that hard honestly, just make sure you\u2019re organized, avoid distractions and have a good strategy in studying.\n\n3. As I mentioned earlier, just don\u2019t jam all the studying till last minute cause it usually stresses us than it actually helps. Having a job while taking a full load course is overwhelming but everyone has different strengths and capabilities, you\u2019ll know what to do once you start studying. \n\n4. Welcome to university students life! Specially engineering lol. There are few courses that runs late, sometimes till 9pm. Unfortunately We can\u2019t do anything about it.\n\nI tried to answer the questions to best of my knowledge and experience and I hope they\u2019re helpful. Best of luck!",

You will have 6 courses next year and they will all be harder than anything you've ever expected. Probably around 10 times the amount of work as high school. Bring your average up or don't waste the money.",

Most of the increased depth comes in the later units (sequences and infinite series). Otherwise they are very comparable.

Also the prof had us buy the textbook but all the things on the exam were in the lecture slides; I think only one project was based on the book so that we had to buy it then after that it might as well have been used for kindling in terms of uses with the slides matching the book. Bonus credit was about 3 points if I remember correct and if you take the class you will need them as you will lose those points with your papers due to random things that they will work very hard to try to find. If you can avoid taking it then avoid it. The higher year students that grade the weekly papers like to grade people down for completely stupid reasons but the final exam is easy.\n\nI took the class maybe 3 or 4 years ago for reference, so I don't know what its like now or if its changed any, plus my work ethic wasn't the same then so the grading down part might have been attributed to that but none the less losing 3 points out of 10 for something so tiny on weekly assignments adds up fast. 5% assignment each week for like 50% meaning if you get 7/10 each week means you just lost 15 % of your grade to some older year student who is purposely looking to mark you down rather than to read the paper for what it is, yet that's just my opinion, maybe its wrong I don't know. Just make sure to choose that class wisely,\n\n\\**and take a look at who the* *prof* *is and his or her* *reviews.\\**\n\nbest of luck.\n\nlastly my opinion of the class is largely negative so hopefully somebody can contrast that with the good parts of the class, and or confirm or deny if its still like how I described.",

I lived at home in my first year, and while it felt like it sucked, I basically only slept there (most of the time) and spent almost all of my waking hours hanging out on campus. Don\u2019t sweat your living situation too much, how much effort you put in will have a far bigger impact on your social life than where you sleep.\n\nI\u2019m fairly shy, so I get it, but you just gotta put yourself out there. Plenty of other people will be in your shoes, just talk to them and you\u2019ll make friends. You\u2019ll have a good year if you make it a good year.",

(I know the school is associated with Dalhousie so I'm hoping it's alright that I ask about it here). Anyways I'd be looking to attend an undergrad as a somewhat mature student (I'm 25 at the time of writing and hope to apply sometime next year) and so I really want to make sure I make a good choice because I don't have much time to waste. I'd like to apply for their Foundation year program ideally and then go into a bachelor's of journalism and possibly history. Any insights or advice are very welcome!",

Even if you're not Nova Scotian; any Canadian health card will work.\n\nIf you're international, you need to provide your insurance details. The clinic may not be able to direct bill your insurance, in which case you'd need to pay out-of-pocket and then file a claim with your insurance to get reimbursed. You'll need to call the clinic to find out.\n\nI really hope you're not here as an international student without any medical insurance! Our healthcare can be extremely expensive if you're uninsured. Please consider getting international health insurance if you don't already have some!",

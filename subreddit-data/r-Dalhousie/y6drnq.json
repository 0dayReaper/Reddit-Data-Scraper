It's within Dal's power to pay them a living wage but they are refusing to do so because they want to save the money! This University is becoming more of a laughing stock everyday and it makes me ashamed to even wear my Dal merch outside. Do better Dal you greedy fucks.",

EVERY MAJOR POST-SECONDARY INSTITUTION IN N.A. operates as a business first, educational institution second. \n\nYou should check out how fat the endowments are for these schools. Dal has an endowment of ~800 million, UofT has an endowment of about $7 Billion, for reference. Harvard is about $53 Billion. \n\nThat money comes off the backs of student tuition, and is a machine which is supported by big banks because they love to lend &amp; finance student debt. Our governments also encourage this model because they offer (some) funding, and more importantly offer tax breaks for educational institutions. Usually discounts on property taxes are the popular break. \n\nThis is the way of our world guys. Gotta fight for every penny in a capitalist society to prove your worth.",

Unfortunately this would require us to actually create a society based on ability. In Britain the grammar schools were of such high standard that they were the equivalent of an American university degree. Thus why Americans poached so many of their graduates. At this time it must be noted that so few people actually went or needed to go to university that university was free and students received living grants monthly. This was Before the British government destroyed them for the egalitarian and American model of poor education. But ssshhh lets not mention any of this because we want universities to be about making money and the level of a degree to be literally worthless.",

You are probably golden.\n\nThe precarious labourers (part-time instructors, markers, and TAs), are waaaaay underpaid. Yes, TAs and Markers are given a lump sum for X number of hours, but they are often overworked by tenured faculty who checked out 10 years ago with little to no recourse. PT Instructors get 5.2k (before tax) to build a curriculum, teach, answer questions and emails, design and grade assignments, etc. Which, after taxes, works out to be anywhere between $10 to $20 an hour.\n\nIt's a mixed bag.",

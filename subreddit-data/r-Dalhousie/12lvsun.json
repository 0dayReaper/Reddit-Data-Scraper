However much like that, it gets a lot easier after a few months and you settle in. \n\nI'm in a MSc of human communication disorders so I bet it varies a lot by program too. Good luck! U can DM if u have any questions or anything! :)",

Sure if you are comfortable working with your peers then go for that but I'd suggest a single room. \n\nPick courses which you're interested in and not just because it's a hot topic.. Lot of folks pick machine learning just to drop it half way through or end up failing it! (6000 level courses are MCS and PhD courses that are geared towards research)\n\nSome of the courses are very popular and get filled up quickly so don't wait around. Lock in courses when they open up! (keep an eye out for Dr. Srini's courses, they're popular among all students)\n\nGet a good laptop here which will last for 5+ years.. don't cheap out on that. Save on food by cooking at home. \n\nMACS is supposed to make you a generalist programmer who can apply for multiple jobs in the industry but feel free to specialize in something which you might like as that'll increase the chances of getting a job in that field!",

            "comment": "First year is pretty chill. Classes are relatively easy, workload is only a bit heavier than most high schools.\n\nYour best bet is to find a good study group or two. Seek out the people who are doing well, as they're most likely to have good study habits that you can compare and adopt.\n\nSecond year is when things really start to ramp up, as you'll have a six course overload with no true bird classes. You want to use first year to set up good habits, and to get to know your classmates.\n\nSeriously, don't neglect your social life! Your degree will be a lot easier with friends to lean on. A bachelor of engineering is a genuine test of will, and you will have days where it's difficult to stay motivated. It's easier to shake off the funk when you see everyone else struggling like you are, and still persevering through it. And by just being a part of the group, you provide that same reassurance to them on their down days.",

Do homework early, so you have time to ask questions during office hours if you're stuck. If you put in your 45 hours per week, and 40 of those hours are actually productive (not the usual fucking around online that so many of us do while \"studying\"), you'll probably come in closer to 4.0.\n\nAlso, especially in first year, be prepared to reduce your contact with people who are going a bit too ham with their newfound freedom. You can still be friends, but you may need to reconsider studying with them if they're never bringing anything to the table. Nobody's expected to know it all, but we're all expected to know something!",

I think the part I need to work on is not getting distracted when I work so I can actually be productive with the hours I put in.\n\nThank you for your thoughts and tips!",

            "comment": "I want to emphasise u/Lusankya\u2019s advice on having a good social group - even if you\u2019re socially content with a few solid friends, it pays serious dividends to be on good terms with many people in your program. You\u2019ll likely have lectures, labs, tutorials where you\u2019ll be confused, but it\u2019s near-guaranteed one of your mates will know what\u2019s going on if you\u2019re friendly with half the class. The undergrad engineering society (DUES) does have a tutoring program, but it\u2019s normal (and free!) for classmates to explain things to each other. \n\nI used \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d for some of my classes. Have members of your study group focus on particular topics in greater depth, then review as a group with each person leading study on their section. It cuts down on the time each individual person has to spend on bashing their head into the text. \n\nThere will be social media groups for your class: make sure you\u2019re part of them and you hear about what\u2019s happening. You don\u2019t have to be a party animal, but it\u2019s worth showing up to some of the social events. Dal eng is a very collaborative program, and your life will be easier if your classmates want to work and study with you. \n\nLastly, if you have the time next summer it may be worth taking second-year classes early. The second-year classes are generally harder than first-year, and taking six at once is pretty demanding. Some think this is good preparation for third-year, but I also think taking good care to learn important fundamentals pays off later.",

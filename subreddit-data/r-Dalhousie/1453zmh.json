If you are planning to do a major/minor/certificate, you might want to pick electives that will satisfy the requirements for the major/minor/certificate. In your first year you might not know yet what major/minor/certificate you'll want to do, so you could just take electives that you think will interest you and that may help you decide your major/minor/certificates.",

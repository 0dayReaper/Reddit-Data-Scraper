While he was in the hospital and for a week or so after he passed, I stopped going to class and completely blocked out any thought about school without contacting anyone. Now I fear I\u2019ll probably fail at least some of my classes because I got so far behind in material and work. Is there anything I can do now, or is it on me for not contacting anyone sooner?",

The assistant dean of student affairs at the time for my faculty was Patricia Laws and she was absolutely wonderful at helping me navigate what to do while I figured life out.",

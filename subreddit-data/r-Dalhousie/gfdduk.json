    "postText": "First and foremost, I am not a Dalhousie student. I am simply someone who doesn\u2019t appreciate the mob mentality that often follows accusations of this sort. The expression is \u201cInnocent until proven guilty\u201d not \u201cguilty until proven innocent\u201d. In the interactions I\u2019ve had with Jad and what I\u2019ve heard from everyone who knows him, he is and always has been an upstanding person and member of the community. This subreddit seemed like the most effective way to get this message out. With that out of the way, the evidence now.\n\nFirstly, we have proof that previous and current Dal students have had their emails and names stolen to sign this signature without their approval. Some of the people in question even made comments on the petition to say as much, yet their comments were deleted. Suspicious to say the least. \n\n[Example 1](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/VxZQzid?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)\n\n[Example 2](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/nmRfKnk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)\n\nSecondly, we have very obviously doctored screenshots of DM\u2019s supposedly held with Jad, which were used to slander him further.\n\n[DM](https://m.imgur.com/a/hWJzGsu?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)\n\nThirdly, we have many people who can provide alibis for Jad on the night of which the events supposedly occurred. Many people have said that they were either with Jad the whole time, in the location that the event occurred, or in a location in which they would have seen the event occur. On top of this, the person making these accusations has no media presence whatsoever and no one seems to even know who they are. The examples of alibis were posted in the comments on previously deleted threads on this subreddit. [Here](http://archive.vn/iWkrx?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) and [here](http://archive.is/nQUqE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) are the links to these archives if you feel like reading them. In these the accuser also claims she did not fake the signatures as I previously mentioned, and encouraged people who\u2019d had their identities stolen to DM her with their concerns. Many people did message her but no one got a response, and she then deleted her reddit account, at the same time of which the poster of the petition deleted their reddit account as well.\n\nLastly, to quote a comment from a user on one of the previous posts, the fact that the accuser made a petition on change.org instead of going through the proper channels or to the university itself seems to suggest that this person simply wants to ruin Jads life instead of finding justice. \n\nI\u2019d like to conclude by saying that, regardless of all of this evidence I cannot say conclusively whether or not these events did happen. I simply wanted to bring to light how suspicious the whole thing is, and that, if it is all just a slander campaign, it\u2019s unfortunate that sexual assault was used as the channel to convey it. Sexual assault is not a joke and is not something to take lightly. Things like this only help to disingenuously portray true victims of sexual assault. If you have anything to add or any counterpoints to anything I\u2019ve said please feel free to say so.\n\nPEI Sexual Assault Help Line : 1-902-566-1864\nKids Help Phone : Text CONNECT to 686868\n\nEDIT : As a someone has just pointed out to me, a few users were in fact able to receive a response from the accuser regarding the falsification of their identities. I don\u2019t mean to finger point and I apologize if I came off that way",

            "comment": "Hi - I'm one of the people that was with Jad that night. I have to say, this whole story just doesn't seem to make sense even logistically. (EDIT: Jad's gf wasn't there ALL night, but for a lot of it - point is that Jad was around our group of friends, we were all around) I was with them for lots of the night, the only time when I wasn't in the same area as Jad was when I actually was in his ROOM. The door to his room was open, as were the doors of everybody else's bedrooms. I could see into them, I could see pretty much everything going on. And all I witnessed was people going pee and the occasional puff of a vape.\n\nAside from that, I also just know Jad very well. I have been friends with him for years. I've been drunk around him, I've stayed over at his house. I've helped him clean up after parties. I have never, ever, seen him behave less than polite and respectful. He has never made an advance on me, and has always just been a good friend. Before the self-isolation protocol kicked in, I can remember sitting with him at Coburg Coffee and essentially crying to him about some personal things I was dealing with. He bought me a latte, cheered me up, and wrote down any ideas I had to make the DSU better.\n\nSo yeah, accusations from a person who has no existing social media accounts about a night that I observed from start to finish, doesn't seem to make much sense to me.",

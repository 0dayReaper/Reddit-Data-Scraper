When I said I wanted to go to dal for marine biology the lady in the phone asked if I had pre calc and said if I didn\u2019t I would be placed in arts but bc I did I could apply for science.",

If you want to actually do the science yourself as a career, a BSc is often (but not always!) required.\n\nWhwt do you plan to do when you graduate? If you need a BSc for it, you don't have a choice. If you don't need a BSc, you can do either.",

I 100% suggest taking OCEA 1001/1002 as your English course, and also sign up for classes asap because the biology courses fill up quick (as a general tip). \n\n\nAlso, even though most courses post their notes and lectures online, attend every lecture! It is very easy to fall behind so stay up to date on the lecture notes. \n\n\nPhysics may seem hard and not very fun, but the required courses for future OCEA is well worth it, and if you put in the effort of studying, it\u2019s actually pretty easy. \n\n\nAnd as a final bit of advice, in case you have a set idea of what you\u2019re into (for example I\u2019m obsessed with learning about orcas) don\u2019t forget to branch out your interests, especially on those easy assignments. You never know what might catch your interest!",

I\u2019m gonna be honest I\u2019m also interested in orcas and mammals so that\u2019s something I really want to learn about but will def expand my interest!! Thank you!!!",

Speaking with my advisor, this is mainly for students who don\u2019t meet the pre requisites for the science version (so students who are lacking pre calculus) I think  the course requirements (that you take throughout the 4 years) is the same whether or not you take the arts version or science version. however. So having pre calculus is definitely going to be beneficial",

When they cant find out who caused a damage, the whole floor splits the bill.. had a friend pay on multiple occasions. Howe food is definitely the best imo though, but if you live in risley you can go to any meal hall. \n\nRisley rooms are much bigger, and you get your own sink. Its also a party res but not to an extent where its always loud &amp; trashy.\n\nI lived in LMP in first year and I loved it. Definitely more expensive but my single room was amazing. Ate at risley, not always great but not horrible. The way I saw it, I liked pregaming w my friends at Howe, but I would hate living there. Party at the party res, sleep in the comfy res \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd",

None of these distances are by much over how but it\u2019s nice if you\u2019ll live there a while.\n- Risley\u2019s shaped like a large trident with many rooms\u2019 windows looking across courtyards into each other. If you plan on doing anything private and you get a room like that remember to close the curtains.\nEnjoy your studies!",

            "comment": "Never lived in either but from what I've heard from friends and in passing 100% Risley. Avoid Howe at all costs. In my first year I heard that they burst a pipe, flooded a floor, and maxed out their residence fines. I don't have all the specifics but this was 2019/20, so it wasn't even a full year of school. \n\nIt has been known as a party residence for literally decades according to alumni I've spoken to and the rooms are tiny as shit. Unless you are only at school to party don't pick Howe if you can avoid it. Don't get me wrong, I know some people live there all year and aren't partiers and do fine, it's just not ideal from everything I've learnt from alum, res staff, and current students.",

Lowkey think Risely people are a little better for parties(the people are better, not necessarily the size of the parties)",

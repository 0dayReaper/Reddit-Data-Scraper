They always have to bust out the buckets all over the whole building to deal with the leaks.\n\nI totally understand what you're saying about a hockey rink being good for the community, but also, the LSC houses two of Dalhousie's flagship departments (biology and oceanography) and the fact that they let it exist in its current state of disrepair is shameful. But for Dal, \"we built an ice rink!\" probably has a nicer ring to it than \"we fixed our leaky building!\"",

Tuition, especially international tuition, is skyrocketing. The admin is trying to make it easier to replace tenured professors with part-time employees. Or simply not replacing retiring faculty at all, leading entire departments struggling to teach the students they have and maintain their research goals.\n\nInstead of spending money to address these issues, and focusing their priorities on the classroom, they\u2019re building a hockey rink.",

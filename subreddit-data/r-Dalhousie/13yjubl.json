    "postText": "Hi, I got an offer for Gerard which was not on my preference sheet as it\u2019s too far from campus and I don\u2019t like the communal bathrooms. \nI\u2019m trying to find an apartment near campus but I\u2019m not sure where to start as I\u2019m not from halifax and have never actually had to look for an apartment before. If you have any tips or websites or know anyone who is looking for a roommate please let me know!",

            "comment": "Your best bet is to keep the spot in Gerard Hall. Anything closer to Studley Campus in terms of apartments is going to be extremely hard to find and quite expensive because of Halifax's low vacancy rate. You can try Kijiji and Facebook Marketplace for roommate postings, but your options will be exceptionally limited.\n\nIt's about a 20 minute walk up to the SUB from Gerard, and there are busses that bring that commute down to 10-15 minutes, with bus stops about 5 minutes from the residence. Not ideal, but still pretty close.",

You are, after all, a paying student that Dalhousie is providing a service.",

THE CLASS SCHEDULE. i\u2019ve never wanted to kms more picking classes than i have at dal. they need to offer more classes during the summer that will help students who are behind catch up. I wanted to enrol during the summer and there was literally not a single class i could take towards my degree.\n\n4. how they treat transfers. i transferred from smu after my 2nd year, and they don\u2019t have the writing requirement that dal has. i had to spend my first semester at dal getting requirements out of the way, and the worst part about that is that i took 3 or 4 equivalent courses at smu that would be considered counting towards the requirement, but they didn\u2019t count because they were transfer credits. i\u2019m in biochem so it felt like a HUGE waste of my time and money to do more arts classes.",

Maybe I was young and lost, maybe it was the system. I try to work my up from minimum wage. Guess what? It's debilitating. I come back to grind through Dal's CS program at age 28, looking to use transfer credits and a promised co-op program to get ahead. I tell BOTH the previous and current Dalhousie co-op leads that I need to get into co-op. They then proceeded to give me TOO MANY transfer credits. Yes, that's correct, the very people \"qualified\" to ensure that I get into co-op made a major mistake, and showed to me that I am TOO FAR AHEAD?! No big deal, just explain to them the issue, right? WRONG. Not only do I find out that I am not allowed to PAY for a botched co-op service, I find it out 3 MONTHS later. I call both people, and am told in monotone that I am basically shit out of luck, and that there are \"many other opportunities out there\". Add to that what everyone else has been saying: that this \"school\" is actually a publishing firm with a brown-nosing PR face, and professors scrambling to get tenure instead of actually teaching. Has anyone seen the money the top profs and deans make? It's obscene, compared to my increasing debt and the inability to do anything about it without going through this monotonous hellscape.",

But I\u2019m pretty sure that most of them find out that the department is not as expected and they share their experience online thought social media. Now I think the department cannot attract top grad students anymore.\n\nThirdly, the student bodies. Especially in lower years, there were some very bad ones in class who dragged down the entire progress. Dalhousie need to setup a way much higher cutoff line to eliminate those people from entrance. \n \nNova Scotia doesn\u2019t have a strong economy and Dalhousie need to make advisement around the world to attract students (money) including very good ones).

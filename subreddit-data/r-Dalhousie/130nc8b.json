With over 375 volunteers this year, you're sure to meet a ton of cool people looking to get involved in the Music Industry on the East Coast. \n\n### We still have a hand full of volunteer positions available throughout the event including ticket sellers, door greeters, load in and setup crew, and more.\n\n### Volunteers get access to the Conference portion of the event, can sign up to attend live showcases, and get a snazzy ECMA volunteer T-shirt!\n\n### [More info can be found here](https://www.ecma.com/ecma-2023/volunteer-at-ecma/) or feel free to shoot me a DM if you're interested in helping out behind the scenes and meeting some new faces!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r1cvj08hpfwa1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fe80f016c58f41059d2efd0aa43306c2244702ca",

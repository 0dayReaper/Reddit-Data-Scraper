    "postText": "I unfortunately did not meet the minimum grade for one of the prerequisite course for advanced standing nursing. I plan on retaking the course this fall semester and then apply for advanced standing nursing again for the 2024/2025 school year. \n\nIs it worth it to continue my education at Dal, while I wait for next year's application process or accept the two year practical nursing (LPN) program at NSCC? I have an appointment with an academic advisor and admission advisor, but I just want to hear others opinion, especially those who have encountered the same situation.",

The GPA to get into advanced standing is quite high so if you plan on retaking the other course you may also want to spend the time retaking courses you\u2019ve already completed to increase your GPA. \n\nIf you have a seat in the LPN program you can always take that and then take the one course again and get into Dal after or taking a bridging program through STFX or CBU. Good luck!",

A couple LPNs I know had trouble getting into BSN programs afterwards so I might keep that in mind. (I think mostly to do with there being very few bridging programs in the province, but StFX did just increase their capacity.)",

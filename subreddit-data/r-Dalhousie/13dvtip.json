    "postText": "# \n\nGood day, Say I were to appeal to defer an academic dismissal, what are the chances of it getting accepted? I'm a first year engineering student and this is my first time getting a dismissal. Im feeling tense about this since I do not want to be out of uni for 8 months. Should I submit an appeal first or meet with the academic coordinator (Jason Lecoure) first? If anyone has any advice or help please let me know what can be done.",

Taking more courses as of now will be very difficult for me to manage. Is there any ways that will help me defer an academic dismissal under probation?",

I know that is quite a bit if you\u2019re under financial strain but it is worth looking into because it\u2019s a surefire way to defer dismissal and work your way back to good academic standing (you\u2019re placed under restriction in terms of the number of classes you can take until your GPA is high enough). \n\nI\u2019d get in touch with the appropriate advisors and ask about the program. If there\u2019s a way you can get financial aid in order to take this program, go for it because this program works. I know 2 people that have been dismissed and are on the cusp of graduation now.",

I had some extenuating circumstances that I provided proof of, went part time the first term back then slowly ramped up back. Had this whole plan presented in my meeting with Jason. He was quite accommodating and understanding so with a valid reason I\u2019m sure you could.",

Additionally, you need to put the effort in to figuring out *why* you were not successful; if you don't change that, appealing your dismissal is just delaying the inevitable.  I can totally appreciate the financial strain you're under, but the \"Refining your Learning Skills\" course needs to be your top priority.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck",

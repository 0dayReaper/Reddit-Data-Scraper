    "postText": "I\u2019m a high school student living in Toronto and I can\u2019t decide which program to accept. \nCost seems relatively similar (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) and both are known for having a good student life (which is important to me). I haven\u2019t decided what direction I want to go after uni, so a university with lots of opportunities for networking/internship is important to me. Additionally I love the outdoors, but the rainy climate in Halifax turns me off.",

I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s like at Guelph, but make sure you take that into consideration.",

I decided on Dal for uni and do not regret it one bit it was a fantastic experience and moving out east gave me a lot of perspective on life. I graduated with my biology degree in 2021 and am so glad I went to dal it was a great school and great experience. You will not regret living near the ocean.",

Dal is rather close to the ocean all things considered its like a 30 min walk to the waterfront which is super nice especially if your in town for the summer. And if you just want to look at the water the northwest arm is like 5 mins. I didn't do co op but a bunch if friends did and didn't have a problem with it. There are also really cool biology and marine bio field courses in the summer.",

If you\u2019re interested in networking, I\u2019d choose Dal. It\u2019s an U-15 prestigious university. They have great labs, but so does Guelph for biology and science. Co-op may be easier to acquire at Dal though. It\u2019s hugely competitive at Guelph and few people get it.",

I don\u2019t think any school is really short on co-op, it\u2019s just different. You can also find your own jobs for co-op that\u2019s not on the job board. \n\nMy home is in Toronto and I plan to apply to some co-op jobs in Toronto. Dalhousie is affiliated with IWK so I imagine it\u2019s easier to get jobs at that hospital, but I guess that\u2019s true for Guelph general too. I think the science programs are great at either university. \n\nYou\u2019re right about Guelph being cheaper. It\u2019s about $7.6k per year for science. I\u2019m not sure where I got $14k from. I\u2019m starting at Dal in the fall.\n\nIn terms of networking, it depends on what you want. I don\u2019t want to stay in Toronto. I want to go off to the US eventually, so I don\u2019t mind extending my networks to various locations. I also think networking is fairly similar across Canada, as long as you find yourself in positions that allow for networking to take place anywhere.",

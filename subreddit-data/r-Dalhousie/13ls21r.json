What are some things to look out for before signing a lease?\n\nWhat questions should I ask the landlord or RealEstate agent, what are dealbreakers I shouldn\u2019t even consider, is it normal to pay 3 months rent up front?\n\nLooking forward to your responses.\n\nThanks!",

I\u2019ve heard some people are paying a few months rent upfront just to stand out from the crowd of people looking for rentals. It isn\u2019t a renters market unfortunately.",

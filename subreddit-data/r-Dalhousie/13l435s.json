Cliche as it is - be yourself, and you'll make friends. Most of the friendships in Shirreff develop slowly at the dining hall. So, if you pair oweek friends with mustering up the courage to ask people when they're eating or if you can sit with them you will be fine. Your oweek friends could be your forever friends, or they could be strength in numbers friends until you find the people that align with you best through chance mixing at the dining hall. (Also don't call the dining hall the cafeteria - the staff working there hate it and if you make friends with them they'll turn a blind eye to.you leaving with food)",

In my experience everyone was super friendly and many people don\u2019t know anyone, so everyone wants friends. You could put contact info outside your door or just knock on your neighbours doors (that\u2019s what I suggest) and introduce yourself! I honestly didn\u2019t meet anyone I didn\u2019t already know at O-week except at one event, so you probably won\u2019t make that many friends there (but maybe you will). I personally found it overrated. Overall you should be fine!",

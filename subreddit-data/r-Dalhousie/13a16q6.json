I am just wondering if someone can share with me your GPA or Casper so that I know if I need to take extra courses to boost my GPA ? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks so much !!!!",

I believe the program also has a specific amount of seats for specific applicants, and there is a preference for in province applications. Hope this helps.",

Admin is always busy and probably understaffed, so it might be that your email didn't get seen. Heck I even applied last year knowing I wouldn't get in just so I could have an advisor look at my transcripts. Cost a bit and one year of waiting for next cycle, but it paid off.",

As soon as you turn 21 or as soon you\u2019ve been out of high school for 2 years, I\u2019d advise you to not list your family income, even if your place of residence is your parents house.",

If you are supported financially by your parents regardless of age and employment income, then you may not need it. \n\nI can\u2019t afford 5 years of tuition without applying for OSAP and other scholarships. \n\nTo limit the debt you owe to your parents or regarding loans, you should be applying for as many scholarships as you can. If you\u2019re covered by your parents under no conditions, then I guess you don\u2019t need to worry about it. \n\nThe general entrance award date has now passed. You can apply for other awards. Check Dal\u2019s Money Matters site. They have some options available.",

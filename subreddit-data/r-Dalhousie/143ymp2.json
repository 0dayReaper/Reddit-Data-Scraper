    "postText": "Hello everyone, I'm a CS undergrad, and 2023 Fall is going to be my last semester at Dal by the end of which I should fulfill all my degree requirements. So, by January 2024 I'll receive all my final grades and become eligible to graduate. However I have looked at convocation dates for 2024 and it seems that the earliest will be May 2024, which is after the Winter semester. Does this mean that I won't be able to receive my degree before May? \n\nDo students who finish their program on a Fall semester actually have to 'chill' for five months before they're able to use their degrees for employment? Or is there a way to receive your degree before the ceremony happens? \n\nThank you.",

            "comment": "For students graduating in late May/ early June the Dalhousie senate typically confers the degree mid May. I have heard of students who have finished in January or February (think like defending a graduate thesis) and have requested their degree be conferred before the typical end of semester date so they could apply for jobs which require it. I am unsure if you would need to request something similar when finishing up in December, or if there is a scheduled senate meeting to confer degrees for the large amount of students in your position, but if you needed \u2018to graduate\u2019 and there isn\u2019t, you can make the request.",

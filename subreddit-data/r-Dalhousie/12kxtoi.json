I got a conditional offer because I still need a precal mark. \n\nI\u2019m a mature student so my circumstances differ a bit. I definitely slacked in high school. My average could\u2019ve been a lot higher. \n\nI\u2019m currently acquiring prerequisites, I\u2019ll be adding grade 12 chem and pre cal. I\u2019m not sure how much that will boost my average. It may just stay the same. \n\nFor Dal, you only need a cumulative average of 75% for science. Don\u2019t worry. You definitely don\u2019t need the highest average to get in. It\u2019s a business. Universities want your money. Hopefully your sis gets in.",

They will also be reaching out to contact you about it soon to explain your situation and options.",

That way it\u2019s on your record but you can get back to taking classes.\n\nI\u2019d start the process and return the email saying you would like to continue with your studies. You will likely need to attend a few meetings with the dean to plan how you will do better as part of this.",

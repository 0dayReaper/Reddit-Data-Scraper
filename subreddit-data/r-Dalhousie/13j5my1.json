    "postText": "Hey all. I am currently waitlisted for dal's nursing program this fall...I'm torn between attending dal (given I get in) and another college, which I've been accepted to already for nursing. I want to move to Halifax and I think dal is a great university, but I don't love the fact that dal's nursing program involves summer school. I am absolutely willing to put in the work during the summer months as well, but I am just wondering from people in this program - is a summer semester without much of a break too much? Do you guys feel at all burnt out? If you could go back, would you have picked a 4 year nursing program instead? Thanks guys!",

I didn't miss having summers off - in fact, we had longer breaks because of COVID and it felt like we were wasting what could have been productive time.\n\nThat said, you already have another offer elsewhere. Is it worth it to wait and see if Dal comes through? Or just go forward and commit to the offer you do have?",

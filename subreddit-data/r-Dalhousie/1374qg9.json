            "comment": "That other comment was written by Snapchat AI lmao.\n\nAnyway BIOC3610 is pretty straight forward material is super interesting but tough and the reports will require a good deal of studying and practice (IF YOU ARENT FAMILIAR WITH PROFESSIONAL REPORTS). \n\nThis course isn\u2019t for the faint of heart but it is rewarding as it builds on many new concepts from previous Biochem courses. Personally I loved it and it wasn\u2019t that hard to score an A+ in long as you devote around 10 hours a week to it (not inc class time)",

            "comment": "BIOC 3610 is a biochemistry course offered at various institutions, so the layout and requirements may differ depending on the specific course and instructor. However, in general, this course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the basic principles of biochemistry, including the structure and function of biomolecules, metabolic pathways, and biochemical regulation.\r  \n\r  \nTo succeed in this course, it is helpful to have a strong foundation in chemistry, including organic chemistry, as well as a basic understanding of biology. Some prior knowledge of biochemistry may also be helpful, but it is not always required. The level of difficulty of this course will also depend on the individual student's background and study habits.\r  \n\r  \nI would recommend checking the course syllabus or contacting the instructor to get a better idea of the layout and requirements of the specific course you are considering taking. This can give you a better idea of the amount of time and effort you will need to put into the course to succeed.",

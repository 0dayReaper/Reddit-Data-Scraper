            "comment": "Taken from the dal website: \n\nClasses with an X or Y in the number (ie. ENGL 1000X) are part of a full-year class, and you must take both the X and the Y part of the class consecutively in order to receive credit for it. If you choose to register in X/Y classes, you must register in the same section for both the X portion and the Y portion.\n\nIt also says under the \u201cNotes section\u201d under the course on the academic timetable that you must take both Hist 1022/Hist 1023 to get the writing requirement. Make sure you\u2019re signing up for the actual writing requirement class, Hist 1020 is the the same course material as 22/23 but is less heavy on writing and therefore does not constitute as a writing requirement. Writing requirement classes will explicitly say (Writing) next to their name on the academic timetable. \n\nHist 2021 is a normal second year class where you are expected to have already learnt how to somewhat efficiently write an academic assignment from your first year classes. I normally don\u2019t recommend taking second year courses in first year because you\u2019re graded on a certain understanding you\u2019ve already done some university work and have underwent the transition shock period of highschool to university already.\n\nHope that clears up your question",

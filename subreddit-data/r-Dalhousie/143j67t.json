Kinda worried because I don\u2019t really know what I need to do for them or what they really are in general, any suggestions on them or just help me out on what I actually need for them? Thank you much appreciated \n\nPs I love this subreddit it\u2019s helped so much that you to everyone how\u2019s on here helping people you all are the best",

Especially in first year, electives are a good way to explore other areas of interest outside of your intended major. For example, I took two semesters of first year psych as my electives because I was interested in neuroscience, and first year psych is required for that major. Your electives don\u2019t have to be just in the sciences either. You could take first year philosophy, economics, poli sci, sociology, etc..",

These are courses you aren't required to take, but need to take in order to get enough credit hours to graduate.\n\nHowever, you may be required to take certain types of electives which is what I think you're referring to? You may have requirements to take classes in a certain area/field but which classes you take are up to you. For example, I'm a computer science student and I have to take two lab science classes. I can choose whatever courses I want for that requirement as long as they're considered lab sciences.",

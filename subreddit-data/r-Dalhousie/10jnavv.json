They don\u2019t pay anyone\u2019s rent, they don\u2019t provide anyone free food, nor do they pay for the airplane tickets. Why not just lower tuition because I don\u2019t see where the support is being put.",

Honesty, it's an extremely scummy thing they do, a cycle that ultimately traps people. Ex, government pays for schooling (grants), universities/collages see that people are getting governemnt money, so the raise the costs of courses, people cannot afford them, so they get student loans, the government sees that people are struggling so they give more grants, and well, you see where it's going. Hurray for perma-debt, you'll own less than nothing, and be miserable/angry about it.",

They get millions upon millions of dollars in donations from alumni. \n\nThe government isn\u2019t paying for shit.\nGovernment grants are minimal at best and are usually hidden away like most forms of financial assistance. \n\nDal offers basically no scholarships.\n\nResearch grants are dog shit to say the least and processors expect for you to secure your own funding otherwise good luck getting into honours.\n\nInternational students are being hosed on tuition based on a false sense of \u201cprestige\u201d about this university. \n\nThe tuition raises don\u2019t go to custodial or support staff, profs, admin team or any of that. It just feeds the top of the food chain e.g. prepare yourself for another university president making an obnoxious salary.",

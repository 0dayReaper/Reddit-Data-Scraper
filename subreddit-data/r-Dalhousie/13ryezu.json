            "comment": "Studley House is one of the older buildings. It's an outbuilding of Howe Hall, which is where you'll normally eat.\n\nYoure unlikely to find floorplans. Your best bet is to reach out to Red Life by phone or email, but I wouldn't expect a ton of help. It's not like Risley/LMP/Fountain where all the rooms are standard sizes.\n\nBasic furniture will be provided, and anything extra you want can be picked up pretty easily from Ikea once you get here and size up your living space.\n\nYou also don't want to bring too much stuff right away if you have a roommate. Rooms can get pretty cluttered if you're planning to bring things like extra chairs. Ask for their input before bringing bulky things into your shared space!",

            "comment": "I used to live in Studley room 303, which is third from the top on the left side. Based on that, I'm thinking 209 is the one in the bottom right corner. Either that room or the one next to it has its own bathroom (if you look at the third floor, that bathroom on the bottom is inside one of those rooms on the second floor. Idk which one it is but you may have got very lucky there. Other than that, I had a friend that lived in the room above that one on the third floor and they had radiators on three walls so their room was basically a permanent sauna. Idk if that also happens on the second floor, hope not for your sake. The building sucks but it's great for being close knit and meeting people, still have a lot of friends today that I first met there. Hope you have a great time!",

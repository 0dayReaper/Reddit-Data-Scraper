Instead of telling everyone who doesn't agree with your arrogant useless mindless they are a sheep and to reaearch, why dont you actually do some reaearch. Useless twat, when you become a pandemic research doctor with a degree and actual research your opinion will matter, until then, no. The doctors who have degrees have stated their opinion, and their opinion means more than yours. They are educated doctors that do what they do because they want to help people, not because the government said they have to. ALSO. You really think every single government would agree to fake a pandemic? Thats the stupidest thing anyone has ever said. They can't even agree on what a basic human right should be.",

I quarantined when I got home and the mask mandate was in effect since May 2020 to June 2021 here, so I haven\u2019t been in public without a mask. We have low case numbers for a population of 7 million (like 100/day 7-day average) and we\u2019re almost at herd immunity vaccinated. I\u2019m fully vaccinated with Moderna but have to quarantine for two weeks, which I\u2019m not worried about. I just really want to avoid staying in one of those starvation hotels I keep hearing about. I don\u2019t know, if I was Canadian, I\u2019d trust a 28 year old, fully vaccinated person with friends and family in Nova Scotia who would actually respect the province\u2019s people, rather than 18 year olds from Ontario who have proven to disregard COVID precautions. What do you think? I\u2019ve been visiting Nova Scotia since the mid 90\u2019s to visit our family and don\u2019t want to risk bringing the plague there. I\u2019m driving the whole way to avoid the ferry and passing through New Hampshire,and Maine (low risk states) and only stopping for gas and paying at the pump. I just know there are reports of people skipping meals in those hotels. I genuinely want to do the right thing because I have respect for the people of Nova Scotia, but I feel like I\u2019m responsible enough to quarantine in my own living accommodations. What do you think?",

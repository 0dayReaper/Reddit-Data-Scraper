I didn\u2019t apply to nursing. \n\nIs it easier to get into nursing if I take a gap year and apply as direct entry, or if I take the advanced standing route?",

            "comment": "That would be pretty dependent on how well you do in your first year courses. If you do well, getting into Advanced Standing isn\u2019t really any harder than getting into Direct Entry. \n\nI applied to Advanced Standing at the end of my first degree and got in, even though my first year course marks weren\u2019t the best.",

I didn\u2019t end up going - I chose a different program instead. \n\nMy GPA at graduation was 3.70 (at Dal that\u2019s an A-, or about 80-85).\n\nThis is not everyone\u2019s university experience, but I will share mine with you. I was a 96 average student in high school, and at the end of my first year of university I was at about 70 average. Granted, I had trouble adjusting to university at first, and did significantly better after taking a gap year and coming back with better focus on my goals. All in all - there is nothing wrong with taking a gap year if you have concerns that your university grades will not be as good as your high school grades are. \n\nSome of the prerequisites for Advanced Standing are challenging courses, and you\u2019ll likely have a busy year trying to do them all in one - but if you\u2019ve got the drive, you can more than likely pull it off!",

Plus you can explore what field you\u2019re really interested in taking electives as well. At the end you know what you are actually into. You might not like sciences! Who knows :) I do encourage you to take advanced standing track. \nI have 4.06 gpa and did worst at casper (4th quartile) and got in this year. All the best for you!!",

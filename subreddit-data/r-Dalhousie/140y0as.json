It can be challenging in general reading Philosophy but if you go to class you\u2019ll have no issues. \n\nThe class discussions are without a doubt in my opinion the main reason to take a philosophy course in university. The professors lead a discussion and will get you to question things you\u2019ve never thought about, and you get to hear from the wide range of students who will have ideas and opinions you\u2019ve never thought of. \n\nI think I may remember the prof asking specific students questions in class to make sure everyone was participating, but not to a large extent at all. It\u2019s also Philosophy so there isn\u2019t really right or wrong and the discussions are a great chance to speak your mind and and questions.",

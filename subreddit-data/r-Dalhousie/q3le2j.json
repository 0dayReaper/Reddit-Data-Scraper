    "postText": "Dal just sent another email about the \"unsanctioned street parties\" aka homecoming. This is getting so tiresome... Dal senior administration sure loves to do a lot of fist shaking without taking any substantial action or enacting harm reduction plans.\n\nIt is such a joke that Dal fails to take any responsibility for this mess... \" universities  across the country are grappling with a social media-fueled party  culture and a growing phenomenon of large, unsanctioned street parties\". Even if social media plays a role I doubt it's the main culprit. How about the fact that Dal invited 1000s of students back to campus for an in-person university experience, with absolutely nothing in the form of worthwhile weekend events (which, if hosted by Dal have a gathering limit of 250, and can be controlled by Dal security which costs less than HRP). Not to mention the dry campus policy, which obviously pushes drinking into the surrounding neighborhoods, and guess what else? Makes it harder to apply the student code of conduct to these actions (pretty convenient eh?).\n\nDal should have known hoco would be an issue as soon as they decided on a return to campus, and based on student behaviour in the past, they should have anticipated that gathering limits would be violated... and they did what to mitigate this risk? Send an email to the entire student body announcing an upcoming party and saying hey! you better not go to that... or else... or else you have a week off class... yeah... nice one. Not to mention that based on the way Covid-19 reproduces in the body a week is not a long enough time frame to be sure that you aren't infected.\n\nIf Dal wants to be disappointed in their students, that's cool, they have the right to be disappointed, but I would prefer if they would stop the BS lip service. If you are going to do something... do it... stop wasting my time and inbox space.\n\nConvenient that they can't release information about how the student code of conduct is applied due to privacy reasons. I wonder how that would hold up to a FOIPOP request?",

            "comment": "I agree that Dal\u2019s events and the dry campus aren\u2019t great. Dal\u2019s events were mostly lacklustre during my time as a student, which led to looking for other social activities (usually drink-a-thons) somewhere else. I don\u2019t think a dry campus is really enforceable, and it just leads to students behaving in harmful ways without supervision or help. E.g., drinking off-campus in potentially unsafe locations, hiding alcohol consumption or inebriation, delaying medical attention for alcohol poisoning or injuries, etc. \n\nI get that the school does not necessarily want to encourage students to use the campus as a playground rather than a learning institution, but it seems irresponsible to pretend that people will follow strict rules rather than shirking them or moving the problematic behaviour elsewhere. If students can get some partying out of their systems on campus they might not disturb other neighbourhoods so badly.",

            "comment": "Considering most first years and some second years aren\u2019t even legally allowed to drink yet do you really expect Dal to give them alcohol? There are so many legal problems that Dal would open itself up to with something like that. They also dried to host a dry hoco before and students just used it as a pre-party. That\u2019s the problem. Dal doesn\u2019t want to open itself up to that liability because there is going to be a problem and Dal will just get sued. \n\nDal does a lot of shit that they should be criticized for but I really don\u2019t get what people wanted them to do here. The party took place off of Dal property, the owner of the property didn\u2019t do anything about the people who threw the party to my knowledge (correct me if I\u2019m wrong though), the police were there and didn\u2019t shut it down, and a good amount of the people there weren\u2019t even Dal students. Students from Saint Mary\u2019s, the Mount, high school students, and random people who just wanted to go to a party all went.",

                    "comment": "I don't expect Dal to give underage people alcohol. Plenty of schools around the country host events where underage and legal age students are present, without being sued. In this case, it seems possible that hosting an event on campus could have served to split the giant crowd into two smaller and therefore more manageable crowds. However, this is speculative, and Dal has has no obligation to host any events during a pandemic or otherwise. My point is that Dal holds some responsibility for what happened. They can be disappointed but they certainly shouldn't be surprised. The events that we witnessed were in part a result of their policies around alcohol consumption on campus, and a lack of effective policy around how to prevent large street parties around campus (admittedly this is not an easy problem to solve, but Dal has just been doing a lot of finger pointing so far).\n\nTo your second point, you are basically saying that this is not Dal's responsibility or problem. That's fine, I can accept that. But if this is not a Dal issue, why is the majority of recent Dal correspondence related to it? Since Dal did not enact any effective preventative measures, they are now in the position that they have to enact punitive measures, or everything that they have been saying is worthless. Don't get me wrong, I'm not into people getting suspended or expelled, but since Dal made no worthwhile effort to play good cop, they are now in a position where they have to play bad cop, and if not, lets just drop the whole charade. My point is that I would actually prefer if Dal said nothing about the matter at all, because all we are getting a lot of talk with no action.\n\nDal's messaging around this issue has so far felt very patronizing and disingenuous to me. By avoiding on-campus events Dal avoids the risk and pushes it into the streets. That's fine, it's a smart move in some ways. But in doing so, they lose the right to complain about things that happen off campus.\n\nOn a second reading, the email is slightly more substantive than I initially thought, Dal does acknowledge that something needs to be done differently, and for that, I give them credit. Thanks for you reply.",

            "comment": "Well, they set themselves up for this. They didn't even announce potential repercussions from Dal itself when people were partying in groups larger than public health orders allowed last fall, kept the situation with the students laughing about their tickets earlier this year pretty under wraps, hid behind a code of conduct in a way other universities don't do (they don't even announce what ramifications there were so it's not exactly a deterrent), adjusted the code of conduct to address education over punishment (despite public health measures being in place to varying degrees for 1.5years), and honestly have botched disciplinary action in cases it's needed and used it in inappropriate cases pretty consistently. \n\nIf they ensure students who threaten to r*pe other students on social media have their names protected and graduate on time (dentistry scandal) while only reallly punishing the people who reported it, if they force a disability rep (Mary Macdonald) to a code of conduct hearing for calmly expressing concern to the accommodations Dept and Dean about ableist commments being made in the dsu, if you have any knowledge of some of the BS that goes on at the Truro campus... This reaction is not a surprise. \n\nAs someoe who's gotten warnings for my behaviour for being \"too aggressive\" for hyperventilating during a panic attack, and have been eported to the assistant dean by a prof for inappropriate behaviour because I literally just accidentally closed a door too hard (sure it had nothing to do with the profs refusal to respect my accommodations and me pushing back on that), all I can say is... Go dal \ud83d\ude44. I have so many stories of serious BS relating to my disability with dal, but students who objectively endanger other students seem to always be supported and protected.",

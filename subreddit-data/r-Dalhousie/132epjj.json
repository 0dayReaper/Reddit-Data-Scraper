    "postText": "Hey folks, I'm going to be entering Dalhousie at the Halifax campus for my 1st year in the Fall semester, feeling pretty good about it, but I'm worried about where I'm going to be living. I tried applying for the Fall residence for 2023, but it doesn't look like they're accepting Fall applications, only Fall &amp; Winter and Winter applications for some reason. This is kinda making me rethink applying for res at all, because I don't want to end up in a place that I end up hating for 8 months instead of 4.\n\nIf I do apply, then I'm considering Howe Hall double bunk rooms because they're the most affordable by far, but I've heard like, REALLY bad things about Howe Hall which I also want to consider. Like most students, I'm also not gonna have any money whatsoever so affordability is VERY important for me, and I'm not sure if I could maintain living in the other residences due to cost.\n\nAt the same time, I'm wary of Facebook Marketplace or Kijiji listings because I'm currently living in Utah, and don't have any relatives or friends living over there to check out the quality of a property for me. There's also no chance in hell that I'll be able to afford an apartment from a property manager of sorts. I've got a random assortment of questions that I'm going to list below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. How are the double bunk rooms at Howe Hall? There's literally no images online that I can find, or anybody detailing their experience with these rooms. Edit: I emailed res about this, and they do look the same as the Double rooms in Fountain House, only difference being the sink. A picture of the Double rooms for Fountain House can be found on the Howe Hall website.\n2. Is dealing with the 'ruckus' at Howe Hall worth it for affordability purposes? Is it really as bad as people say it is?\n3. Should I consider Kijiji/Facebook Marketplace listings at all in my case?\n4. If I consider marketplace listings, when should I start looking?\n5. Is there something that I'm not considering or isn't mentioned in my post that needs clarification?\n6. Are there any resources at Dalhousie that would be particularly helpful for someone moving to Halifax from abroad?\n\nAny input is really appreciated, obviously there's no such thing as a perfect answer. :)",

Most are offering 8 months, but there are still sublet options. Start looking now, because some rooms do pop up early, but there won\u2019t be a ton until June-ish.",

Kijiji also gives me bad vibes lol, not really sure how to explain it. \n\nWith how much they charge for residence, and the required meal plan (that I have heard isn\u2019t very good quality), if your breaking the bank trying to afford something it would be a last option (personally). Halifax is not very big, and there\u2019s lots of bus routes that easily get you to campus. And if that doesn\u2019t work out, starting your day with a 20 minutes morning walk isn\u2019t that bad. \n\nI\u2019ve met more people who live off campus, than those that do - so my view is biased, but the one person who I did know lived in residence said they weren\u2019t much of a fan.",

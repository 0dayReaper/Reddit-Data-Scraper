    "postText": "Hi, I will be coming to Dalhousie next year for a Bachelor of Engineering. I was wondering if any other Dalhousie programs have similar course content. What I mean is how similar is the Physics, or other science content, for Engineering students to the Physics, or etc, content taught to say DISP students?",

            "comment": "Same Physics and Chemistry course in the first year as DISP. \n\nThermo is way different in second year, and my guess is easier for Eng students. I am going into 3rd year so I can\u2019t really comment on later courses. \n\nI have found the marking in Engineering to be beyond fair and they always seem to push deadlines when asked.",

            "comment": "Can't speak too much on the content of other programs but the eng courses are pretty similar to the physics ones in first year and take a radical shift in second year onwards\n\nDepending on which eng you take, it is one of the if not the hardest programs offered at dal.\n\nComparing to physics again, courses are similar difficulty but with eng you have to take 6 courses per semester compared to 5 and the marking is much more brutal for eng courses.",

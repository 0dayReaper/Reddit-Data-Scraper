    "postText": "I want to apologize for making more posts on this subreddit, I know that this situation is extremely exhausting but as I mentioned in my previous post, this platform is the most conducive to what I am about to do. Outlined below is every statement made in the petition's most recent update (posted today, May 19th) that is entirely untrue or misleading. All the quotes are directly from the update. Where further evidence is needed I provided links to back myself up. I hope it answers any questions you may have. If not, please comment below and I'll answer any questions you may have. I will be sharing this post on my social media as well.\n\nNote: This whole update is easily refuted if this individual would simply give poof of being a Dalhousie student (B00#).  I am entirely confident that this person does not exist therefore will not provide the identification.\n\nRegarding the extraordinary council meeting, I\u2019ve already addressed why I did not leave immediately. It was because I was unsure of what I should do. As it was my first council meeting I did not know what actions to take. To avoid any conflict, I remained silent and allowed all discourse to continue unimpeded by me. However, once told by the chair that I must leave, I left promptly and did not return. Also, the discourse was regarding my pay and I have the right to know if I will be able to pay rent and afford to eat.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s laughable about this is that my identity has been confirmed with the DSU and HRES who are the only two investigative authorities in this case.\u201d\n\n1. The HRES said that it has not conducted an investigation because \u201cno one had come forward to file a complaint\u201d\n2. A police investigation has already begun and the DSU is not an investigative authority.\n3. Making online contact with the DSU or HRES does not mean the identity has been confirmed. Furthermore, using an email is not proper identification.\n\n\u201c As of the 19th of May, no investigation has been conducted or even initiated yet\u201d\n\n1. The HRP has already begun an investigation. The officer in charge is Oliver Beottcher. I strongly suggest calling the HRP if this isn't enough proof.\n\n\u201c...Neither would go forward with their processes if they were not certain of my identity as a Dalhousie student\u201d\n\n1. HRES is an investigative faculty and has stated that they are not proceeding with an investigation. So, this statement is untrue.\n\n\u201c...have scheduled a meeting with the execs later this week to discuss investigative avenues.\u201d\n\n1. This is what I have been asking for since the very beginning.\n\n\u201cNot to mention Change.org prides itself on being 100% bot-free with their algorithms that detect &amp; delete signatures and comments from illegitimate emails.\u201d\n\n1. I never claimed that bots were used. I said that students and alumni found that their dal emails were being used to sign the petition without their consent or knowledge. These dal emails are legitimate.\n2. This statement is untrue as bots can be used to falsify signatures on [change.org](https://change.org).  \\[Proof\\]([https://imgur.com/3HEW1R9](https://imgur.com/3HEW1R9))\n\n\u201cIf he was truly under the impression that My identity was not real, why didn\u2019t he mention it in his first statement?\u201d\n\n1. The initial statement could not include any evidence that I had regarding the identity of the individual as I did not have all the information that I do now. Also, the initial statement, as the DSU did, was merely acknowledging the accusations, taking an official stance of innocence, and making my intention for an investigation clear.\n\n\u201c..DSU.. have been provided with corroborating evidence by me as early as May 6th.\u201d\n\n1. Even though the petition was posted on April 29th, it wasn\u2019t until May 6th that the first contact with the DSU was made. However, this individual stated multiple times that they hadattempted to make contact with the DSU as early as May 4th. The DSU\u2019s statement on May 5th proved that the individual never contacted them at that point.  These statements were posted on a \\[reddit post.\\]( [http://archive.vn/iWkrx](http://archive.vn/iWkrx))\n\n\u201cHe attempted to manipulate this stating \u201cthat no one has substantiated claims\u201d. Which has been proven false in the DSU\u2019s most recent statement as well as in their extraordinary meeting of the council.\u201d\n\n1. The DSU\u2019s most recent statement only includes the decision of the extraordinary meeting and does not include any proof that the accusations were substantiated.\n\n\u201cHow dare he claim that he endorses justice and investigative authorities while he is actively obstructing investigative efforts such as this council meeting.\u201d\n\n1. Council is not an investigative effort. They were debating my suspension, not the validity of the claims.\n2. I would never and have never obstructed any investigation as that is what I have been trying to initiate from the beginning. Literally everything I have said as been in support of an investigation.\n\nI have made every statement from my own personal accounts and I have personally answered every question directed towards me. The author of this petition, whomever they may be, has only provided a singular email and a reddit account. If they could prove that they are actually Olivia MacDonald they would've done so ages ago.",

So if there was another type of investigation or internal review where the union was analyzed and it was determined everything that\u2019s wrong + recommendations (eg. Bylaw changes), and this was called for by the student population and we held them accountable for it. Student unions are not for profit but they are still run somewhat like businesses, this is no different than a company having an internal investigation/review for its practices or environmental practices. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a quick fix or an easy one by any means but it needs to happen. That or the DSU needs to be no longer recognized by the administration and a new union needs to be formed",

NO ONE KNOWS THIS PERSON. \n\n\"She\" can't have been harrassed as she claims because she's not on social media. That's the strangest part of all. \"Olivia\" exists through a gmail and a petition. Why does this person not have a Facebook, instagram etc? \"She\" claims to have deleted them but I don't buy that for a second.\n\nThe fact people still think this is a person is insane. They'd rather stay true to their neoliberal dogma. I'll be willing to listen to a word of these claims when \"she\" presents a B00\n \nWhy would Jad Ghiz be begging for an investigation if he did anything wrong? So many of you would rather call him a \"master manipulator\" than consider he may be innocent. Shameful.\n\nI use this account to remain anonymous to protect myself and those around me due to the backlash that others have received.  The claim Jad denying the existence of these accusers is against all survivors everywhere is disgusting. I know of jads conduct when a mutual friend of ours came forward to him after suffering from an awful sexual assault and Jad was there for them in an unwavering fashion. \n\nI beg the individual with this vendetta against him to pls stop this attack, apologize and let this all be resolved. You are ripping a man's life apart just  because he won an election and you are bitter about it. this is beyond wrong and it's not too late to call this off and make amends. pls consider my advice.",

Is it this excerpt from [Madeleine's post](https://cdn.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/dept/university_secretariat/policy-repository/Sexualized%20Violence%20Policy%20rev.%20June%202019.pdf)?\n\n&gt;After learning of the disclosure, the DSU immediately contacted Dalhousie Human Rights and Equity Services (HRES) todiscuss the investigative avenues available. The DSU Executive requested a university investigation, as no one had come forward to file a complaint with the university. At that time, HRES was unable to initiate an investigation. \n\nBecause given that the [Sexualized Violence Policy](https://cdn.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/dept/university_secretariat/policy-repository/Sexualized%20Violence%20Policy%20rev.%20June%202019.pdf) section F1 says that information about investigations can only be publicly disclosed if it's anonymized - which in this case would be impossible since we know who the accused is - it seems *very unlikely* that HRES actually denied the existence of an investigation\\* and more likely that HRES just said they couldn't start an investigation at the DSU's request.\n\n\\* Unless they deny all investigations when asked about specific people, which is the same thing really.",

If an investigation was started I would know about it because they\u2019d have to talk to me about the claims. The accuser has yet to even initiate any investigative process! (Said so in the most recent update) I am the one begging for the investigation to continue.",

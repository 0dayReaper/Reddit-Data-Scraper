            "comment": "Can you ask where you are approximately on the list?Also i'd wait until June 1, since that's the last date you can accept an Ontario Uni. A lot of students apply to dal from ontario there's going to be a lot of shifting in the next 2 weeks. If you can still get on the residence list at dal i would definitely try you don't want to share a room with 6 other people while you wait for a dorm.\n\nSidenote: If youre dead set that Dal is the place for you (Which wouldn't be surprising because i think it's one of my favourite places on earth) take a general science undergrad - take the physics, the anatomy, physiology (if you can), the english credit etc and stack yourself with electives that would slot into a kine degree (talk to an advisor in kine to make sure you hit all the fine points things may have changed in the last 4 years) and apply to transfer for your second year or your second semester. From personal experience second year classes are hard because they pair Kine ANAT, with Physics and a second year kine physiology course if you get physics in first year and some of your more time consuming electives out of the way you can pair some easy first year kine courses with the harder second year ones. Then 3rd and 4th year will be normal for you.  \nSee: [https://cdn.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/healthprofessions/School%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Performance/KINEPofS2122.pdf](https://cdn.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/healthprofessions/School%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Performance/KINEPofS2122.pdf)",

I hope that I do get an offer this year but if I don't, Ill apply super early and hopefully get in next year",

With a 95% GPA you should have been offered a seat in a BA (kinesiology doesn't require precalculus for admission so I'm assuming you don't have that done and thus wouldn't qualify for a BSc spot). \n\nTalk to an advisor and see of there's anyway to start as a BA student. You can reach out to kinesiology profs and explain the situation once you're a dal student and they may be willing to let you take some of the first year kinesiology courses. Otherwise, you could try to take things that would count as elective or any intro science courses you need.",

Yeah I was shocked I didnt get in with such a high average and i took a gap year already so id rather not wait until im 20 to go to university but if i have to i will. I got accetpted into my second choice program which was management, since i didnt take pre cal 12 my options are limited for science degrees",

I did a semester of kinesiology then switched back to med sci and no courses I took while in kinesiology counted towards my gpa (but i did get the credits) for my BSc in the faculty of science. I keep forgetting its considered a science degree. \n\nYou should have no issue switching into it for next year. Talk to an advisor and try to take courses that would count towards kinesiology if you really want to go that route. There weren't many other people getting 90s in the semester I did, so I'm sure you're more than capable (kinesiology is definitely one of the easier degrees at dal). I'm wondering if they're prioritizing student athletes or something.",

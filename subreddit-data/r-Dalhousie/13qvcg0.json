    "postText": "I just got accepted to Colpitt house at mini res. It sounds nice in theory and I like the location but I can barely find anything online about it. Also does anyone have any pictures of the inside? So far I\u2019ve found a total of three and I don\u2019t even know which houses they are. \n\nI feel like it\u2019ll be harder to make friends given the small amount of people. For residence activities and stuff like that, it seems like mini res isn\u2019t included. Can I still join in?\n\nI also saw on another post that the insulation is terrible so it\u2019s really cold in the winter and you can hear everything. Is it really that bad?",

            "comment": "I was in mini res last year, though I was in Lyall I spent a bit of time in Colpitt\u2014 the inside\u2019s pretty nice from what I remember. The bathroom\u2019s are very rarely anything less than clean, and the lounge is pretty big, has a couple of sofas, a table and some chairs, and a pool table, as well as very large windows. Really nice place to hang out. \n\nResidence activities heavily depend on your RA. We had a wonderful RA who would run activities about once every two weeks on the weekends, and we were also usually invited to join the Howe hall residence activities. From what I found, going to the residence activities is what helped me make friends in residence, but the friends I ended up hanging out with I made in clubs and societies. \n\nAgain, I can\u2019t talk as per how Colpitt is, but at least in Lyall we had thermostats that would control the room temperatures for 3 or so rooms\u2014 so heating was never an issue.\n\nFor noise levels: again, I can\u2019t talk as per Colpitt, but in Lyall (and from what I\u2019ve been told, also in Henry), minires tends to be dead quiet more often than not. Most days, the loudest things were the crows outside my window. This also depends heavily on the other people living in Colpitt with you\u2014 if they\u2019re all for the most part quieter, then you won\u2019t have noise issues. It\u2019s also worth considering that a lot of the more outgoing people will have applied to live in sherriff or howe , and even the more outgoing/party people in minires usually go to other residences to party (or at least that was my experience).",

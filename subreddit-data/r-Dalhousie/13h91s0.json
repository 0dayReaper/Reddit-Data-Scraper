    "postText": "Hi, folks. I\u2019d like to ask you a couple of question regarding renting in Halifax. I am in the process of getting my study permit, and hopefully I\u2019ll start my graduate studies in September. Since I am a grad student, I most likely (I guess 99%) won\u2019t be able to live on campus. So, I am trying my best to gather as much info as possible about available options. What I\u2019ve considered so far:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I\u2019ve thought about arriving in Canada about a month earlier, let\u2019s say in late July, to look for rentals myself, assuming I got my study permit in time. But I have a feeling that because of the housing crisis 4-5 weeks won\u2019t be enough to find something reasonable.\n\n2. From what I\u2019ve read, renting Airbnb for 2-3 months can be a better option. Then you can focus solely on finding the right place. The only downside is probably the fact that you won\u2019t have as many options in Sep-Nov like you do now. And I guess Airbnb is not the cheapest option as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich option would you find more reasonable? Now, some questions about renting itself:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I won\u2019t be able to get any references because I don\u2019t have relatives / friends living in Canada. Maybe it\u2019s not such a big deal considering I am not a freshman but a young professional pursuing my master\u2019s degree (?). \n\n2. I won\u2019t have any payslips from a Canadian employer to prove my income. However, after opening a Canadian bank account, I\u2019m going to get a bank statement showing that I have enough money to pay the rent. How do you think, will it suffice or should I get anything else?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated! I would also be grateful if you could share any resources that you find useful! Maybe there is another reddit community where I should post this?",

Renting an Airbnb may be an option but Airbnbs are getting banned in most of Halifax starting in September so keep that in mind...\n\nAs for your questions,\n\n1. Most landlords will require a Canadian parent to co-sign your rent, which you obviously do not have. I'm a Canadian in a professional program who has a full time job contract signed for 2 years and I still needed one at every place I applied for. When asked if you have a co-sign, ask them if they would accept several months rent up-front in lieu. The standard from those I have spoken too is 3-4 months up front without a co-sign. This is somewhat of a bribe because it is not legal for landlord to request this but most landlords won't rent to international students in general because they are worried about who they can sue if rent is not paid. So it is the compromise that sometimes must be made. \n\n2. From what I know, many Landlords won't care about the number in your bank account since tuition is so expensive it doesn't really phase them. I don't know how much help this would be unless your account has six figures in it or something. But maybe I am wrong. \n\nThat out of the way, good luck friend. Maybe contact the schools international center for help and explain your situation, they may have better resources. I'm a Canadian in a professional program who has a full time job paying well above average and it took me several months of looking every day to the point of exhaustion and frustration to find anything at all. But I did find it. I'm sure you will too.",

Hopefully they will be added to the housing supply.\n\nI don't want to scare you but yeah the situation is extreme dire here right now, even compared to most other Canadian cities. Rents have increased on average about 25%-30% year over year for the last 4 years, so there is a large homeless population now and some tent cities popping up around in parks. \n\nMany international students are living in illegal apartments/living 2-3 to a room/living on couches etc... Though these are mostly undergrads who vastly underestimated what the cost of living in Halifax would be. Unfortunately a lot of scummy international recruiters out there who make international students think that a part time job will be enough to pay for rent+food, when a full time job at minimum wage here won't even pay for rent let alone food.\n\nAll I can really say is good luck. You will likely find a place eventually if you have the money and the willpower to find one. If it's some consultation, Halifax is otherwise a really great city with good people who will likely be very friendly to you and it can be easy to make friends. I just wanted to be honest that it's already a hard market for Canadians, an even harder market for Canadian students, and international students have it even harder on top of that.",

Might be easier to find a sublease that starts in the summer since any place still empty for the summer might be more desperate for someone. A lot of students sublease their place out for the summer while they go back home, it would be cheaper than airbnb. And some would allow you to renew the sublease or sign a proper lease for September if the student is not returning. I find the subleases often don't require any income or reference history.\n\nDefinitely look immediately, ever day. It's very hard to find a place. Many places are gone the day they are listed or within a couple days.",

    "postText": "Hey folks, I'm currently on a conditional acceptance for the Community Design program. One of the requirements listed for it is at least one academic Science 12 subject, but I'm failing to see any clarification on what could be considered a Science 12 subject.\n\n I'm from the US, and the page for US applicants does not clarify what this could mean, and neither do any of the provincial HS curriculum pages. They typically only clarify Math and English courses. I've certainly taken some courses that could possibly be classified as, \"Science 12\" such as an honors chemistry class. At least in my state, we don't exactly distinguish science by grade, but rather by the subject of science; Nova Scotia appears to practice the former.\n\nDoes anybody happen to know any more information on what Science 12 entails?\n\nPlease let me know if there are any errors in my post, or something I'm misunderstanding. :)\n\nPage detailing international and provincial requirements: [https://www.dal.ca/admissions/undergraduate/specific-course-requirements.html](https://www.dal.ca/admissions/undergraduate/specific-course-requirements.html)\n\nPage detailing course requirements: [https://www.dal.ca/admissions/undergraduate/hs\\_applicants.html](https://www.dal.ca/admissions/undergraduate/hs_applicants.html)",

            "comment": "I am from the US too. And from my school honors Chem is a junior class. And science 12 would be more like a physics or specialized class. Like my science 12 was biotech 2. I\u2019m from AZ and have been accepted into the faculty of science at dal just for some more info. I hope that helps. But I would recommend reaching out to admissions or someone from your program.",

I'm from Utah so I would think that our state's curriculum are different in some regard. What frustrates me is that the requirements for the Community Design program only say \"Science 12\" and not something more specific.",

I have no idea how the process works. I've gotten acceptances everywhere else I've applied but still holding out hope of getting off Dal waitlist lol\n\nThanks!",

Which leads me to assume that either not all of the offers have gone out yet or there is still lots of shuffling to be done! \n\nGood luck!!",

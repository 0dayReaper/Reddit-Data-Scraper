They're always breaking news about tuition increases, roudy parties, poor expenditure of public funds, and now mistreatment of academic support staff. It's pretty obvious Dalhousie is not on the right track and needs to refocus on research and teaching which is the basis of the schools purpose. Its mission statement is some convoluted paragraph about all sorts of other things unrelated to its purpose which is a hint they're lost.",

There has to be communication for both parties to do what they are supposed to do. I would imagine some change because abandoning student experience will soon lead to a drop in rankings, and a city they supports an institution less.",

The way that HOCO has been handled in the last 6 years has definitely not been inclusive of civic priorities. \n\nIn what ways has Deep been doing his job?",

Unfortunately for Deep as president the buck stops with him ultimately. If the university is in decline (I would say getting public drug over the coals by the police chief is a good indicator) the president has to own that.",

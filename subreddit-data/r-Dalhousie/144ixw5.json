            "comment": "A big focus of my degree was physical chemistry, so I can say pretty safely that doing 1190 won't give you an advantage in your chemistry courses compared to 1310. I know a lot of chemists who held off on doing first year physics until later, even their final year. The physics in physical chemistry is rooted in thermodynamics, kinetics, and quantum mechanics, not kinematics, optics, or electrostatics (which is what you cover in first year physics). Given that 1310 has a reputation for being easier, and will still give you the credit and skills that you need from a physics course, I would strongly recommend going with that one.",

It's not required to major in chemistry if you're doing two majors and I didn't even take physics in high school. But I do want to take physical chemistry for the certificate in medicinal chem.",

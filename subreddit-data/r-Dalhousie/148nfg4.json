    "postText": "Alright, I need some solid advice here. Before that, here's some backstory:\n\nGonna be working an internship in Fall but will also be a fulltime student. Gotta graduate by April 2024. \n\nMy courses for Fall: CSCI 3110 (algorithms), CSCI3101 (soci/prof issues in comp sci), CSCI 2203 (data science for everyone)\n\nMy courses for Winter: CSCI 2201 (info security), CSCI 4262 (AR/VR), CSCI 4181 (Bioinformatics), CSCI 4176 (Mobile computing)\n\nI need to take 4 more courses. 1 needs to be a science with a lab elective, 1 needs to be 2000+ BESE elective, and the other 2 can be any 1000+ elective \n\nHere's what I'm thinking: I wanna try to take an ECON course from Acadia uni because I can do them completely online and at my own pace (like I can just sit through 2 weeks of xmas and just complete them). That would fulfill my BESE requirement. If I can take 2 easy ECON courses from Acadia that that'd be perfect. I'll take CSCI 1107 (social computing) or CSCI 1109 (Practical Data Science) and Music 2024 (Guitar: Hist &amp; Techniques 1) or ANAT 1010 (Basic Human Anatomy) as the other 2 courses.\n\nThe problems:\n1) I can't register for CSCI 1107 or CSCI 1109 because it says \"This course is restricted to students with a specific range of completed credit hours.\" which is extremely weird because I registered for CSCI 1109 a month ago for Winter '24 and it was fine. I accidently dropped it yesterday and haven't been able to take it since.\n2) Idk how hard ANAT1010 or Music 2024 are. Do they have midterms and finals? Do I actually needs to study for them? \n3) Idk what the process is to take courses at Acadia. I looked it up on Dal and it keeps asking to use the form and find the course equivalencies which doesn't make sense because if I wanna take a course at another uni which isn't offered in dal then how can there be a course equivalency..? So I'm just confused about the process\n\nI wanna keep my workload for Fall as low as possible since I'm working + taking the most difficult course in CS.\n\nPs: whoever helps me out shall go down in my history books \"that one redditor that helped me out that one time\"",

This kind of investment fund leaves no control over the content of the portfolio (as far as I understand it). If we don't have the stocks anymore, it is sadly not because of ethical concerns. Divestment is something that many looked at regarding fossil fuel stocks, and the conclusion was a disheartening dead end. \n\nI only wish that our core values shift from maximizing return to something more ethically sound.

It makes earning a credit easier and mislead students until they are very deep into their degree, but barely able to learn what they have to because they don\u2019t have the foundation. \n\nThis year, the spectre of cheating for a fee motivated many/most faculty members to transition to the \u201cmany low stakes assessment\u201d model in hope to structure learning away from this. The result: a work overload experienced by many/most students. In essence, commercial cheating services has also harmed students who would not consider cheating/plagiarizing in the first place.",

However, the situation looks much more like this for the student who is unfairly accused of exclusively VIEWING Chegg answers.\n\n1. Professor hands out an open-book exam and tells students that they are allowed to use course materials and/or the internet to assist them. The professor has presumably made the exam significantly harder than normal to account for the materials students can access.\n2. Student takes the exam, and reaches a question that they do not know the answer to. Trying to skim the book is not helpful, and let's say the answer isn't in the lecture slides. The student googles the question to try to find relevant information. The student assumes that the exact answer to the question cannot be found on the internet, as that is not something that would normally be found online.\n3. The student clicks a link that shows the first part of what the student assumes is a similar question that can be used as a model. The student may or may not notice that this is a Chegg link. The student likely thinks nothing of this, as they have been cleared to use the internet and have not been warned against using certain sites.\n   1. Note: Like most sites, Chegg keeps users logged in or the computer of the student automatically handles the login process. The student is now/has been logged into Chegg and is now viewing Chegg information online. They are there. There is no \"Are you sure?\" button.\n4. The link that the student picked happens to contain the exact question from the exam that another student has illegally posted. This was not what the student was looking for and the student backs out, though they cannot necessarily help what they have seen.\n5. Student presumably faces AI related punishments.\n\nI'd like to see somebody explain to me how this is not a system of punishment that would catch innocent students... Frankly, it's impossible. The student that I outlined above followed all the rules and was still accused of dishonesty and was punished.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo those who would claim that this is different as Chegg is a paid service:\n\n1. Textbooks are paid, and oftentimes different packages are offered to students that follow different pricing models (book, book+ebook, book+ebook+access to some online learning platform, etc.). Is utilizing the other, extra offerings of some textbooks an academic offence in an open-book exam? It is not. This defeats the paid vs unpaid debate.\n2. What is the difference between referencing a Chegg question that a tutor has relatively affordably outlined online and referencing a question that an expensive in-person tutor has outlined over a coffee table? In both cases, the student looks (during an exam) at a model question that has been worked out to determine how to approach the presumably different question on the exam.\n   1. If the student believes that what they are clicking on is not an exact copy of the question, then how is it their fault that is not where they ended up? Just through accessing the question, they have become part of the list of logged viewers that will be sent to a requesting professor/dean. According to emails released through the freedom of information act, no specific login information is provided to the school beyond a binary \"yes or no\" response.\n   2. Assuming the student doesn't copy the information that they find at this source (a clear violation), how can they possibly be guilty of Academic Dishonesty with what has been described above?\n\nTo conclude, it is obvious that POSTING exam or assignment questions online for assistance is a violation, but it is equally obvious that VIEWING questions posted by another is not, in itself, a violation, at all. It is also clear that the university is failing to clearly educate students on what is allowed and not allowed, which is causing both professors and students a great deal of frustration and stress.\n\nI would highly recommend that the university clarifies what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable use of online services during specifically these online exams, and extends compassion to those who have found themselves accidentally on the wrong side of this confusing policy surrounding an evidently university-approved website (see the post at the top of this thread).",

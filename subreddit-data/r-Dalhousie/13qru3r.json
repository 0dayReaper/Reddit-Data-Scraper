I think a lot of people who go into med sci are misled into thinking that it\u2019s the \u201cprime\u201d degree for med school admissions (I used to be one of those people), when your degree really doesn\u2019t matter at all. Congrats on your med school acceptance btw (I noticed your flair)!",

While there\u2019s positives to the medsci degree I think a lot of people pressure themselves into following the \u201cclassic premed route\u201d which involves doing one of these med sci/health sci programs they have at the med universities across the country. In reality there is no one size fits all approach to med school admissions, and if anything having a unique and personal application is far better than having an application filled with typical cookie cutter stuff. You should study what interests you instead of trying to force yourself into something else",

Dal decided to lower the required grade in bio to C or C- instead of looking at teaching and grading. \n\nI had Mindy and had an A in the course. She's willing to work with students, but bio finals are often rough. It's normal in many of those courses to have finals that feel like they're way harder than they should be compared to the midterms. Bio exams are often applied knowledge on top of some memorization and people often aren't prepared for that..\n\nThe ecology lab average was a 65 when I did it, one of the genetics midterms had a 62 average, etc. The way bio courses are set up and taught at dal in general is not great, but there are far worse profs at dal than Mindy.",

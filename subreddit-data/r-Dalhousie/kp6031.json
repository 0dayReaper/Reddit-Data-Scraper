On top of paying twice/thrice what Canadian students are paying, now the university is asking for international students especially those living off-campus to pay that much money? That\u2019s a month of rent plus a whole bunch of bills! \n\nThis is ridiculous. How can one take this further and address those in power to change this policy? This looks nothing more than a disgraceful money grab.",

I was planning to travel abroad back home for winter break but met with an advisor from the international centre and that advised me not to go. The idea of paying 1k for a plane ticket and also 1k for just 2 weeks was not financially ideal so I didn\u2019t go but this news is very sad to hear. To see all my friends come back and stay in Howe for under $300 when they\u2019re coming from places that had more number of cases than my home country was very frustrating.",

I decided to remain in Halifax during the winter break because of this $1637 cost that I could not afford, and to hear that I may not have needed to pay Dal this amount is heartbreaking considering my family who I was not able to see after being away now for over a year as a result of the pandemic. I feel just as bad for my other colleagues who are now subject to these fees upon their return to the province and residence in Canada",

The province of Ontario alone is experiencing levels of Covid that eclipse many international locations, yet even for Ontarians without off-campus housing, they only have to pay a fraction of this amount to quarantine in a Howe Hall suite.",

On top of the international tuition, shelling out $1,800 on a hotel where from my understanding , you're constantly monitored to make sure you're not breaking quarantine didn't sound appealing in the slightest sense. I also didn't want to accidentally bring Covid-19 to Nova Scotia in case I have it and am asymptomatic, even though Massachusetts has had a mask mandate for 8 months, and I've been taking precautions. I refuse to return until I have taken the vaccine, or having taken the PCR and antibody tests because I care about my friends and family in Nova Scotia. Can't wait to get back and ride my moped around Halifax!",

Trust me, Dal would rather people not quarantine in a hotel so they wouldn't have to foot half the bill. They did what other universities did and were responsible. Leaving during winter break is a choice and tbh no one should really be travelling right now unless necessary. \n\nThere are no complaints from me, but I think everyone has a right to have their feelings about the situation. I get the pov that you should be able to quarantine in your home. It's a tough time overall.",

The issue I have is that the discrepancy as to what standards international students are held to compared to their Canadian counterparts is nothing short of discrimination. I already have to pay more than double the tuition asked of Canadians as an international student, and not being permitted to quarantine in my own home while watching colleagues from Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver allowed to remain in their apartments or pay a fee 1/5 the cost of what quarantining in a hotel is for international students is unsettling to say the least. I\u2019m not looking for reparations, I\u2019m looking for answers and some form of transparency from Dalhousie regarding exactly where $1637 for 14 days of quarantine is going",

I got stuck in bureaucracy hell for about 3 weeks. Residence didn't want me because I was travelling back internationally and the International Centre didn't want to deal with me because I was Canadian. Had to make someone pity my situation before I was able to get help and luckily got it resolved in the end.",

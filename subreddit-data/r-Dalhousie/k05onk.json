Flexibility is a necessity in the world of COVID.\n\nA lot of profs have the mentality that students should just \"figure it out.\" Those same profs are the ones asking for sympathy for how hard COVID has been on them. Cue the world's tiniest violin solo.\n\nI am definitely going to make sure students have options and know that they are not alone. Heck, I am having a hard time with all of this too. With the state of the world being what it is, all I can expect from students is for them to do their best. Their \"best\" might not look the same as it did a year ago, and that's OK, mine certainly doesn't. All any of us can do is our best.\n\nThank you for your feedback!",

Design lectures so that if someone goes through all the lectures and studies them, they should be able to do quizzes/tests with relative ease. \n\nI have 1 class right now in which the professor designs his tests/quizzes very closely/directly to what we study in the lectures so its always fun learning that class because when you pay attention to studying the lectures, you know this material will be very closely coming/tested on upcoming quizzes/tests.",

            "comment": "Number one thing I LIKED: Allowing students to drop their worst two quizzes, DB posts, or whatever else. Most weeks I did great in certain classes, a few I was barely able to get through the material because of the workload from other classes. I really appreciated this. Also, I'm an international student so having lectures recorded is a MUST for me. I also like that I can pause to write notes, I can go back and listen to difficult parts, and fast-forward things I already understand. However, I do understand the other students' POV, so I think having the option to see it live and then having the recorded lectures posted later is probably best.\n\nDISLIKES\n\n* Playing hardball. I get it. Professors want students to know their class is challenging. I'm a first-year student and had profs tell me in this cold, ruthless way that the class is hard and the work load is heavy and that I need to keep up weekly or else I'll fail. I get that some classes will be difficult, but why try to scare students? I was almost homeless due to COVID. I moved homes three times during the term. I'm already stressed enough.\n* Having inconsistent schedules. I like having the same type of assignments due the same day every week. If you have a random assignment due that you haven't mentioned in a while, please remind students with a post on Brightspace or an email. It takes a couple minutes and the entire class will be grateful.\n* Weird discussion board post grading. I actually enjoyed DB posts believe it or not because I got to know the people in my group. What I didn't enjoy was when one of my profs told us \"I know the DB is due x day, but please do it as soon as possible. We can see the time you posted and will grade accordingly.\" Okay then what's the point of having the due date? I like to ponder on what I'll write. It will never emulate a real class discussion, but it's its own cool thing.\n* Strict late policies. If the assignment is a couple of hours late, I wish profs would be more understanding and not take 10%, 5% off, or whatever the penalty is.\n\nEdit: Totally forgot to say but timing of tests. A lot of students emailed one of my professors asking her to grant us more time for the tests, but she declined. I have to rush through the tests and I know if I had 20 extra minutes, I'd do so much better.",

It's key for me to be able to speak with my professors and my fellow students face to face at a set time and day each week rather than being left to watch lectures on my own time, which leads to organization issues.\n\nHowever, it would be a good idea to make sure things are clear on what is due and what is next on the agenda for your class just so that everyone is aware and no one is wondering what's going on. Some professors come up a little short on that. While the day-to-day schedule doesn't usually change much, some students seem to be having trouble knowing what's coming up and what kinds of assignments they can expect in the future due to a lack of communication.\n\nThanks for reading this and for reaching out to students!",

Online courses are hard because they require a level of self-discipline most profs don't even have (myself included). Synchronous learning helps keep students on track. Unfortunately, my class is quite large (100+ students), and synchronous learning isn't feasible. I will have tutorial-type sessions where students can drop in and ask questions, and these will be recorded. I will also have weekly assessments designed to keep students on track in a \"low-pressure\" way. Quizzes or the odd reading response, for example. *Not discussion boards*.\n\nDiscussion boards were a **disaster**.

In my classes, we tend to get weekly assignments. I prefer biweekly assignments with more thought-provoking questions. One, I find it easier to schedule. Two, it lets me focus on practice problems in the textbook first, assignments second. I get the time to cover a lot of the easier problems in the textbook to build some intuition for the subject and then take a crack at the more interesting assignment problems. **But** the assignments shouldn't have a ton more questions to compensate for being biweekly instead of weekly. That won't change anything expect the number of assignments. (i.e. don't half the number of assignments only to double their length lmao)\n2. No group projects. I think this should be a given in the COVID environment except for a small selection of group project courses (e.g. CSCI 3130). Some profs may be thinking group projects are worth it for fostering community right now, despite the obvious difficulties in organizing projects online. In this environment, I want to talk with people on my own terms, not on my prof's.\n3. I don't get much out of lectures in general, and especially not now. It's nice to have the option, but I'd rather learn through a well-structured and well-written textbook or course notes. Key words: *well-structured* and *well-written!* Nothing funnier than seeing your course book take significantly longer to explain the same concept as another textbook. You may notice these books are often in their 37th edition, cost your life's savings, have added 400 pages since the 34th edition, have 40 examples per concept, and 200 practice problems, 500 exercises, and 1000 homework problems at the end of the chapter. Absolutely maddening!!!!!!!!!! It should be illegal to use these as course textbooks!!!!! Rant over...\n4. As others have said, course checklists are amazing!\n\nThanks for seeking out feedback here.

It's not easy studying online, and I detest having to read multiple sources and watch Youtube videos just to understand one lecture. There is little communication from the course except through Brightspace announcements and discussions. I feel like the TAs are doing all the hard work this semester, and I feel bad for them. \n\nI recommend course checklists and a detailed syllabus, which saves students a lot of trouble organizing for the course. The deadlines and other requirements can be still changed later. Flexibility is great: the ability to extend the deadline without much penalty, drop a bad quiz or midterm, and multiple grading schemes. I personally love synchronized courses, as they provide some of the classroom interactions that are missing in an online environment. For records, transcripts are really helpful. I understand that professors are busy, so I appreciate the profs who try their best to support students in this situation.",

Forced discussion boards though are annoying though, like say you have to do a reading and then everyone has to upload their thoughts on it.

At all. And 75% of the submissions for the course are lab material. This was not properly explained to me going into it.\n\nI\u2019m paid $20 an hour. To give you some perspective of how little money this is: I have run seminars teaching less in-depth material on the same subject for five times as much money. I\u2019m actually writing an outline for one such seminar right now.\n\nI have 90 hours of paid work in my contract. 70 of those hours are reserved for developing the lab experiments and manuals and answer keys, and the lab exam. I am developing all of this material to best mesh with online learning and am trying to make up for the fact that students can\u2019t just come by the lab to ask questions. The other 20 hours are \u201coffice hours\u201d. I made it very clear that I can only respond to students emails during office hours. Students rarely, if ever, attend the office hours, and the only time I get e-mails seems to be between Friday evening and Monday morning. And most of these questions are answered by me pointing out that the answer is in the lab manual. The rare questions that can\u2019t be solved by reading the lab manuals can be solved by reading one of the top 5 links that show up when you type the question into a google searchbar. And it\u2019s always the same students who continue to send me e-mails outside of office hours.\n\nNot only that, but I\u2019ve caught students cheating mid-exam and there\u2019s no way to punish them because it\u2019s all online. I can\u2019t prove students are doing their exams in groups and helping each other regardless of the fact that a student will ask me a question and then will forget to mute their microphone and will begin discussing the exam with the other students in the room. Or a student shares their screen with me and forgets to close the chat window where they\u2019re sharing answers. \n\nAnd honestly: I don\u2019t want to punish them for trying to help each other. This semester is awful for everyone. Academic integrity is the only thing making me report it even if nothing can be done. I didn\u2019t even have time to properly record who was cheating because I was the only person who could answer students questions in a timed exam: I was only focussing on answering as many questions as quickly as possible.\n\nThis is all on top of the fact that I have my own studies to deal with. COVID totally derailed my field and lab work.\n\nI\u2019m a good TA. I know the material I help with better than just about any TA I\u2019ve worked alongside, and I know how to break the information down into digestible chunks. I have no problem teaching to large groups of people. In the past I\u2019ve done after-hours help for students. But it\u2019s difficult for me to get invested in you as a student when you can\u2019t cut me some slack and meet me during my office hours. Especially when I reach out to the whole class asking them when the best time for me to have office hours would be, and am met with silence.\n\nIt absolutely sucks that helping students outside of my TA hours is a waste of my time. But considering everything I\u2019m already doing, that\u2019s just what it is. I cannot be available 24/7. You don\u2019t blame Sobeys when you\u2019re hungry at 2AM and suddenly want to buy fresh produce: you take responsibility for your own well-being and buy groceries when the grocery store is open.",

It\u2019s incredibly difficult to study the \u201crequired\u201d material of your degree if the profs can\u2019t teach you how exactly it fits into the overall program that you\u2019re studying to complete. The only reason I made it through the boring or bullshit courses, or the ones taught by bad profs, was because I had classmates who I worked with: we all motivated each other every day, which you can\u2019t get working from home in isolation. Video calls are a poor substitute. Even the good profs who aren\u2019t phoning it in are clearly being mistreated by the university if the recent negotiations between the profs and the university are any indication.\n\nI blame no student for having difficulty learning in this environment: the only reason universities work is because of the social and collaborative physical learning environment.

Or, for the other people in this thread who\u2019s professor isn\u2019t in Canada, simply outside the normal lecture time? \n\nForcing students to attend lectures at specific times with the rest of their peers is basically telling some of them they\u2019re now expected to function nocturnally when they\u2019re 12 hours apart. Idk about you, but that sounds hella worse than feeling overworked for 4 months haha",

You either do what they\u2019re doing now and deliver what is obviously a product not worth the money students are paying, or you restrict admissions to students who live in NS and can provide proof of residence for the semesters that they\u2019re attending. You also make sure the profs are living in NS as well, so everyone is operating on the same time. This would of course cause Dalhousie to lose a massive amount of tuition money, and would greatly disadvantage all of the out of province students who can\u2019t return to Halifax because of one reason or another. I\u2019m confident you\u2019d be able to deliver a slightly better product because you could just force synchronous interactive lectures, but that slightly better product doesn\u2019t help all the students who wouldn\u2019t be able to attend.\n\nI think this shit just sucks all around and there are no right answers. Obviously it\u2019s in my best interest to advocate for whatever makes things easiest for me, the same way it\u2019s in the interests of undergraduate students to advocate for what is best for them. I got cut a raw deal so my opinions on this are going to be stronger or more colourful than other people who might have an easier time: I know if I was simply marking assignments I\u2019d be more than happy with my job the way things are.",

From the perspective of an undergrad student, and from my girlfriend who is a graduate student and TA, 100% the recorded lectures have saved us. \n\nI guess I might feel differently if the work load wasn\u2019t as insane for either of us this semester, but we would have both missed an unrecoverable amount of material had we not been able to rewatch lectures a week or two later. There just literally are not enough hours in a week to keep up on lectures while also completing all the weekly deliverables with any level of quality. One might argue I\u2019m an outlier and that I\u2019m exaggerating the benefit of the lecture recordings, but every single group member of mine in my 5 different design projects this term admitted to not watching a single lecture for 21 days at one point because we didn\u2019t have time. Recorded lectures are single handedly the only thing that\u2019s keeping my entire program from flunking out this term hahah\n\nOut of curiosity, what faculty/program are you working in?",

However, in undergrad in 3rd year I spent roughly 70 hours per week at the university either attending lectures/labs, or doing assignments in the study spaces so maybe things haven\u2019t changed too much lol",

We both are too.\n\nThe unfortunate part is that they generally did it with good intent. From my understanding, the general idea was something like, \u201cInstead of a 40% MT, 10% assignments and a 50% midterm like normal that can easily go poorly for a student in this climate, I\u2019ll make a 30% project, 10% assignments and the remaining 60% will be split into 2-4 MTs to give them a chance to recover if they bomb a MT or 2.\u201d\n\nJust sucks because like every class decided to do something similar and it snowballed. Oh well, we have and will survive! We just need to all hold out a few more weeks until finals start and we\u2019re on the home stretch... I\u2019m sure thats transferable to your TA world, too!",

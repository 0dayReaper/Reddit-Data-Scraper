    "postText": "So I applied for a MENG in Industrial engineering, paid for my application on Saturday. The website says you should send your supporting documents to the department email. I don\u2019t know if the mean the Engineering grad school email or they mean the Industrial engineering email. I have sent an email to both asking for clarification and still haven\u2019t gotten any reply. Dalhousie has only send me an email acknowledging my payment of application fees. I don\u2019t even have a \u201cstudent number\u201d to specify in the email. Those that went through this process I would need your advice on how to move forward. Thank you so much",

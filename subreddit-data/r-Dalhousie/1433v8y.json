    "postText": "I live in Nova Scotia and I\u2019m really interested in computer engineering. I was researching and noticed that Dalhousie is the only place that offers it in Nova Scotia, but I hear people complain about it.\n\nMy other choices are Queen\u2019s, York, or Metropolitan, but it\u2019s kinda expensive and far away. I do want to work some place like Ontario in the future, so going to a university near Ontario will probably help. I also heard that there\u2019s better internships near those universities.\nI\u2019m just not sure. For Queen\u2019s engineering I heard that I need at least an average of 90% and I have an average grade of 92% now. The problem is I don\u2019t know if I can keep it up. \n\nIf Dal has a good computer engineering program then I might stay in Nova Scotia, and maybe in the future I\u2019ll do my masters in Ontario(if I\u2019m smart enough). Do you guys have any advice?",

If you want to develop your self-directed study skills (which are critical for success as a practising engineer), you'll find it's about as good as any other school.",

I usually take out filler words (e.g., \"Edmund Husserl established the school of phenomenology\" becomes \"Husserl 1. phen.\") \n4. explain it out loud, first looking at your notes, then without. The best way to learn something is to teach it (I'm usually just talking to my cat). \n\nOther tips \n\n \\* If it can be an acronym, make it an acronym. That will make it stick in your brain. \n\n* Be realistic. Make sure you understand the big-picture concepts and sense what will be on the longer answer questions (assuming you are studying for an exam). There's no sense wasting your time memorizing what year Sigmund Freud was born if you can't explain the Id, ego, and superego.",

Establish a prima facie case of discrimination (first two ingredients \u2013 onus on complainant)   \n2. Determine whether the discrimination has a reasonable justification (onus on discriminating party)   \na) The standard is rationally connected to the function being performed (RC = Rationally Connected)  \nb) The standard was adopted in good faith (GF = Good Faith)  \nc) The standard is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose in that the defendant cannot accommodate claimant without incurring undue hardship (RN = Reasonably Necessary)  \nSo, to determine if there is reasonable justification: RC;GF;RN \u2013 my Remote Control Girl Friend is a Registered Nurse \n\nThis could only make sense to my ADHD brain but I've found it helpful for tests where memorization is necessary :)",

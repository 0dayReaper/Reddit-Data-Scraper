    "postText": "Hey guys, \n\nGot off the wait list for Dal accelerated nursing and found out I was placed at the Yarmouth site. Happy to have gotten in but pretty bummed about the location, so I\u2019m still considering accepting another schools offer instead. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts or knowledge about doing the nursing in Yarmouth and or any tips on how I should proceed? Considering emailing to ask them about being in Halifax but I assume that\u2019s a long shot \n\nThanks!",

The lady from admissions told me if I got accepted into both I would be able to pick between the two. From that I would assume whether they told you if you were waitlisted or rejected from halifax? I haven't heard back from dal yet. I submitted my final grades a couple weeks back and it still says incomplete.\n\nYou could call admissions and ask about halifax to see what your status is?",

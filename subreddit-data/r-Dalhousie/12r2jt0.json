In my syllabus it states that if you miss the final exam you're not required to send an SDA but to Email the professor and make an arrangement to reschedule, But my professor is currently away as per his email, he will be back on Friday. Is there anything else I should do or forms I need to send?",

Basically the policy says get ahold of your professor and make a new plan.",

    "postText": "Don\u2019t even put it as an option on your residence application. Even if you list a quiet study environment with people who go to bed before 11, and Howe hall is remotely an option on your application, the residence office will not hesitate to screw you over. They not only put me in what is well known, even by the university, to be the loudest residence, but they put me in what is well known the be the loudest house in the loudest residence, Cameron house. Here\u2019s some things you can expect to experience if you have the misfortune of living here like I did:\n\nObscene amounts of noise: it doesn\u2019t even have to be a weekend, yelling in the hallways or running around late at night or banging on walls or tables is commonplace here. Not to mention, if you live in Cameron or Henderson, there\u2019s a 50% chance you get put on the side that faces the back parking lot, in which case you will have the pleasure of being woken up at 6:30am by the beeping of the truck that delivers food to the meal hall. (Not to mention the smells that eminate from the piles of trash and food waste that is kept out in the open back there are bad enough to be smelled on the top floor if your window is open) Also, if the power ever goes out, expect to be given a headache, not only by the noise of the massive diesel generator they have so nicely placed right outside our windows, but the smell of delicious, brain cell killing diesel fumes will soon fill your room, even if your window is closed.\n\nProperty damage: the bathrooms and the hallways get destroyed every weekend. Ceiling panels get ripped out. Paper dispensers get ripped off the wall. Paper towel is strewn everywhere. The stairwell is full of beer cans, toilet paper, and empty disposable vape boxes by the time Saturday morning comes around, and it only gets worse from there because Saturday night still hasn\u2019t happened. \n\nReally rude people: most of the people that live here are the type of people to get ridiculously drunk every night of the weekend. If you are 1 minute late getting your laundry, they will not hesitate to take it out and either put it on top of the machine if you\u2019re lucky, or put it on the floor if you\u2019re not. A lot of the guys who live here are loud and obnoxious, and will get in your face for no reason when they\u2019re drunk. \n\nA loss of sanity: I have genuinely lost my mind from living here. New students, if any of this sounds bad to you, please save yourself the trouble and avoid this forsaken place at all costs.",

            "comment": "Yup, this is all true. Spent my first year of Dal at Howe Hall and it was the worst living situation I\u2019ve ever had. Regularly I\u2019d be woken up at 3am by drunk dumbasses screaming and smashing shit outside in the hallway. One time I was going to my 8:30am class and opened my door only to discover vomit all over the hallway. It stayed there for 3 days before it got cleaned up. I had a window facing the inner courtyard and people would be flashing laser pointers into people\u2019s windows.\n\nIf you even want to attempt to get great grades in school, do not go to Howe Hall. You\u2019ll be woken up over and over again before your 8:30am exams without fail from soon-to-be dropouts screaming in the halls. How Dalhousie allows it to be this way year after year blows my mind.",

With the big ego and lack of intelligence of the hooligans who are responsible for that in Howe Hall, they\u2019re obviously not going to admit their faults because they\u2019re selfish. So that means innocent students who did nothing wrong are also going to have to pay for the faults of rowdy students.\n\nHowe Hall seems to be full of annoying frat boys and those obnoxious types of uni hockey players.",

Public health has already said that we are under severe strain on our healthcare system\u2026 even if 1% of Dal ends up needing to go to the hospital, it will literally collapse the hospitals. \n\nHonestly they should\u2019ve had a hybrid system so those who want to attend in person can do so but those who don\u2019t, can choose not to. There\u2019s many people living with their grandparents and people which can pose a serious threat to them. \n\nI find it very shortsighted and I won\u2019t be surprised if we go back online due to a rapid peak in cases. If anything it\u2019s incredibly inconvenient to go back in person only to most likely shift back online. \n\nWondering what your guys thoughts are?",

By allowing the students that want/need to stay online to do so would protect the students that want/need to be in person due to smaller class sizes and more ability to socially distance. Obviously hybrid couldn\u2019t work for all courses and course work but for those that could it would be nice if it were offered, at least until the under 30\u2019s cohort has had a chance to be boostered.",

Because there were occupancy limits and physical distancing was being enforced, it would have been impossible for everybody to attend every lecture/test/lab/tutorial in-person.  To solve this, all synchronous classes were either 100% online, or in-person with a livestream (most of which were recorded because some students were in different time zones).  Asynchronous online classes were another solution (albeit less common).  In my first semester here at Dal, it\u2019s individual classes that are either 100% online or 100% in-person, meaning that I\u2019m on campus as a transmission vector every day (even for just 1 hour of in-person learning).\n\nI don\u2019t think fully switching back to in-person is a wise choice, but I understand others may be struggling.  Streaming an in-person class is not that difficult, and there are precedents.  It makes no sense how Dal\u2019s approach has to be so binary.  It would be very easy to appease both parties.\n\nFor clarity, when I refer to a  \u201cparallel hybrid\u201d class I am referring to a synchronous class which can be consumed either in-person or online (may or may not be recorded), with some attendees at home and some in the broadcasting room.  Parallel hybrid classes benefit from the ability to rotate attendees so everyone has the chance to attend in-person, *if they wish*.\n\nIt follows that the \u201chybrid\u201d classes here at Dal would be \u201cseries hybrid\u201d classes, with strictly online and strictly in-person components (ex: lectures are online but labs/tutorials/tests/etc are in person).  Series hybrid classes then require every student to be on-campus at some point (which can interfere with isolation/recuperation).\n\nIn my opinion, the parallel hybrid approach would be a much more appropriate response, because if we come back too big and too fast we\u2019re more likely to have a problem and have to go back online.  By opening campus in a conservative way, Dal could ensure the students who need in-person classes the most can get them.  Based on this subreddit alone (and conversations with some friends), there is a significant portion of students who prefer online (now or in general), so the university wouldn\u2019t have to upsell the online portion in order to keep numbers low, and they represent x transmission vectors which ultimately serve to protect the in-person learners.",

Each event had a livestream and, for the most part, it worked.  \n\nTests were cheat-proofed or made open book/note.\n\nPresentations were done by screen-sharing in the class Team.  I was part of a blended design project with some members in-person and some online.  I had no problem talking to the class stream or being heard as a booming voice over the classroom speakers.  After the project was over the instructors told us that we were one of the best functioning, best communicating, and most prepared groups, even compared to the fully in-person teams.\n\nLabs (which admittedly took place in small rooms with tiny groups in the classes I took) had a camera at the front of the room, one pointed at the apparatus, and any detail shots/difficult angles were covered by students broadcasting from their phone cameras.\n\nThe approach at Acadia was one of collaboration, cooperation, patience, and adaptation.  Students in-person understood that they relied on others not being present to give them the necessary space (else we\u2019d all have to go online), so they were willing to accommodate others.  Online students also brought unique resources to the table, from ensuring the streams and recording were functioning properly, to simultaneously helping in other parts of lab experiments (like data acquisition and preliminary processing, research, and troubleshooting) which would have otherwise lead to disruption.  For something bestowed upon the student base on such short notice, it worked surprisingly well.  \n\nDalhousie could absolutely embrace a middle-ground, rather than jerking us all back and forth between rushed-online and poorly-executed \u201cseries hybrid\u201d in-person classes (which are likely to put us back into another rushed-online period).  \n\nNot every decision needs to be made using a light switch; and knowing how much money I fork over in tuition each year, they can certainly afford to buy dimmers.",

Never been big on social media, but I can give you my \"informal\" reply to this.  \n\n\nThis is Frey, one of your DSU exec.  \n\n\nWith regards to \"how we can have our voices heard\" it is a complex question and answer.  \n\n\nThe short and easy action is : The first step is to email a rep, flag down your department's councilor, or really engage in any way shape or form. Most of the exec are even accessible outside of the 9-5, sometimes to the detriment of their academics. Email me. You don't really need to have clear actions, if there's something we're already doing, I can point it out to you and help you understand where we're at. If you have suggestions, happy to hear them. We're in strange and unfortunate political times. I'm also happy to just sit around for a cathartic chat whenever there's a gap in my schedule.\n\nNobody needs to be unheard.\n\nThe Long answer is: Your reps are present in most admin meetings, though some are covered by confidentiality agreements. I'm personally in ongoing meetings with regards to which meetings are by default confidential vs \"move to confidential when confidential things are discussed\", trying to do exactly what I promised: Ensure students are present in conversations about them, and are when possible privy to any information they need. \n\nFun note: If I remember right, senate meetings / minutes and discussions are accessible even when confidential via\n\n\"https://beta.novascotia.ca/apply-access-information-under-freedom-information-and-protection-privacy-foipop-act-form-1\" &lt;- this form.\n\nBut I'm fairly certain there's a processing cost associated as a means of reducing frivolity of requests.\n\nFor your title question here \"What do you think about Dal's return to in person classes\": We have the complicated situation of representing a student body that is not a monolith. Wetdeclan111 here in this thread, if a student, does exist, and says this stuff.   \n\n&gt; \"There is a massive difference between online and in-person learning. It\u2019s been 2 years of this shit, it\u2019s time to get back to some sort of normalcy. The right answer is going back to in person.\"\n\nand he's not alone. We also have students who are not ok with returning to in person. There isn't a clear path where everyone is going to be happy, but more importantly, there are limits to where we can pressure, and by how much. \n\nI have my office hours now by appointment via teams or zoom as a result of medical status in my household, and I've worked in the front line of public health response to covid, so I have my thoughts, but I'm still functionally here to represent the views of Dal in aggregate, not just stand on a soapbox made of other students.\n\nIf you're looking for what we're currently doing to approach this situation, there's a pretty broad swathe of things. As many are in my portfolio (academic and external): We're meeting with NS public health reps, we are and have met with admin to discuss. With regards to the \"back to in person classes\" decisions, there's a science board / consultation with NSPublic health that I'm not personally privy to, but I'm in the process of identifying whether we can get a student rep there, even if just in an observer capacity. \n\nIf you dredge through my council reports (Minutes are on https://www.dsu.ca/council ) you can get a general picture of the week to week, and if ever you want to get clarification on anything that happens there, you're welcome to email us, or look at the various proactive communications (newsletter, various instagram and social media blasts etc). \n\nThe interesting opportunity that the contention of return to in person offers is a position where faculty interests and student interests can be more similar than different. The faculty has its share of (sorry to use you as shorthand wet) wetdeclans, vs people who would be more akin to your view. They're both asking for support and resources and concrete answers from the same body. It also gives you more insight into the decision making bodies in Dalhousie, and how competing needs are triaged, it also gives opportunities to engage in more collaborative discussions which can foster less of a separation between the two.\n\nA decent takeaway I can disclose is: Dalhousie as an administration will be in lock-step with NS Public health. How you view that depends on how you view NS Public health. Arguing against current public health standards is the kind of battle that would require significantly more visibility and numbers, and as it stands there are limited means for me to directly communicate with all students simultaneously (there is a firm limit on how many mass emails we can send out, and anything outside of \"Everybody has an @dal\" starts fracturing into social media platform preferences.",

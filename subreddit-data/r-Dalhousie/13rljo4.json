    "postText": "I work for an engineering company in Halifax and would like to establish a scholarship for Indigenous students going into their first year of university. In order to provide this Scholarship I need to determine what students needs are and what fields would be desired. \n\nI would like to hear from anyone who may be in this position,  what obstacles have you faced, what resources have you found, are there any gaps you've found where more support would have been useful. \n\nShare your thoughts, and if you know any other pages that would be relevant to post on.",

I have certainly considered these additional opportunities and in the future they will be considered and probably implemented. \n\nWe are at a pilot stage right now so determining what students need is our main priority, to see where we can help fill some gaps.",

            "comment": "I think this can be a great idea and would definitely help some students get a degree. \n\nHowever (this is where I\u2019ll get downvoted), I would like to point out something. In the recent years, there has been a lot of new programs and scholarships created to help and encourage minority or underrepresented groups to pursue a college or university degree. While I\u2019m am 100% for helping people achieve their goals and access higher education, this comes with its own issues. While student who qualify for these programs/scholarships can also apply to all general scholarships, people who don\u2019t end up with limited options and more competition. I know a great deal of student that do not qualify that are also struggling to pay for university. \n\nMy suggestion would be to try to help more than just a specific group. It doesn\u2019t have to be everyone. It doesn\u2019t have to be for every fields. But it shouldn\u2019t be very restrictive either. Talk to students, universities, even other people in the industry to see what they need. This is just my opinion and you do what you want with it. All I\u2019m asking is to try to look at the bigger picture.",

From what I've seen during my time in university and researching is that there are a number of supports available to minority groups and more so to general groups for everyone. But there are very few targeted support for Indigenous students entering STEM. While they can apply to all these other resources, the main issue is saturation like you've mentioned.",

Religious groups, military scholarships, having certain grades/being in a specific club, citizenship. One could argue that many of them are pretty much only limited to white people based on systemic issues racialized students face in education. \n\n\nI found this article about representation from Engineers Canada- \n\n\"Indigenous people are underrepresented in engineering occupations relative to Indigenous representation in the total population and in the labour force. This finding holds at both the national and provincial level.\n\nConsidering only those individuals in their main working years with an education at the bachelor level or above, the percentage of all engineers that identify as Indigenous is 0.73 per cent. The percentage of the labour force in their main working years that identify as Indigenous is 3.15 per cent. By this metric, for the engineering profession to include a representative number of Indigenous people, an additional 5,620 Indigenous engineers are required.\n\n\nThe percentage of the total population in Canada that identify as Indigenous is 4.9 per cent. If we consider Indigenous representation in the total population as our benchmark, for the engineering profession to include a representative number of Indigenous people, an additional 9,678 Indigenous engineers are required.\"\n\nhttps://engineerscanada.ca/indigenous-engineering-in-canada",

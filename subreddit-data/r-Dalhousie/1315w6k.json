    "postText": "I am currently looking into this MBA program, and I was wondering if anyone have taken or are currently taking this. \n\n-How are the courses run? (Synchronous or asynchronous)\n\n-What do you do during the in-person intensive periods? Are the exams written in person? Are there a lot of group work?\n\n-Is it difficult? (for an engineer with 10 year experience, but limited business/private sector background)\n\n-What type of people are in this program? And are there networking opportunities?\n\n-How are the professors, and are they helpful/ responsive if you have questions or need help. \n\nA bit about myself, I work in the military as an engineer, working in project management and equipment acquisition. I am looking for a flexible program that will allow me to work full time. I'm looking into an MBA so that I could open up doors for future oppertunities in the private sector.\n\nDo you also know of other flexible MBA programs you know of from reputable universities, that allow for distance learning for a military guy with unpredictable schedules?\n\nAny feedback would be highly appreciated. Thanks!",

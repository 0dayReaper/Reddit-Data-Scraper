When the credits transfer over, your grades/GPA does not transfer - at least to Dalhousie. You have the credits, but it\u2019s a clean slate for your GPA",

Send your transfer credit information, so that's every syllabus of each course you've done. Then wait 6 weeks, they will tell you what can be done, you then choose what you want. 6 weeks later they tell you if they have worked. Then you choose your classes",

    "postText": "Hi all I'm looking for help with my situation, I took a class in the winter term of 2023 and there have been 8 assignments in total, with 6 being worth 30% and the other 2 assignments being worth 70%. Currently, I have been given feedback/grades on 2 of the 6 smaller assignments. I got that feedback on Feb 17th and I haven't gotten any other grades back. The grades I did get back were good at 80% for both of the assignments. But I'm still missing 90% of my grades for the class and I have submitted all the work and have almost 0 feedback. In all honesty, I do not think this is fair as I could easily fail this class and not have a fair opportunity to improve my work with the feedback I would have received.  I also need this class for my degree and I will not be able to take a replacement class to fulfill this requirement until next year winter of 2024 and thus extending my degree. WHAT SHOULD I DO?",

Is there a reason other than nerves that you think you might not have done well? Did the prof give other students feedback that you weren't given?\n\nIf you're just waiting on your grades back and there isnt any reason other than nerves to worry, the best thing to do is probably just to sit back and wait for your grades to come in. It sucks you had to do your finals without the benefit of feedback but it's likely that most of your classmates are in the same boat.\n\nIf you tried your best and did well on the previous assignments, I don't think you need to worry too much.\n\nIf the prof gave other students their assignments back but not yours without a good reason (IE you didn't get the same opportunity as the other students), it's definitely time to reach out to the Dean, ASAP. You should have flagged this a long time ago and marks will be approved and posted very shortly. You'll need to appeal your grade in that case. \n\nIn the future, be aware that the prof doesn't have to give much feedback if it isn't asked for. Profs will give reasons for a grade and will usually be extremely receptive to students who come into office hours asking for extra feedback or help. Most students do not do this. If something like this happens again, the best thing you can do is go to the prof BEFORE your finals and ask for feedback/advice then. \n\nAgain, I'm sure you did great. you should get your grades back this week. Good luck!",

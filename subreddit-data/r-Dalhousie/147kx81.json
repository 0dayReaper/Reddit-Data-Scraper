    "postText": "I was thinking about taking one of two courses, ANAT 1010 Basic Human Anatomy or ERTH 1080 Geology I and I had some questions about the lab requirements and those courses. Are labs, and tutorials in other courses, mandatory to take for you to get the course credit? ANAT has a virtual lab, but I don't see any labs listed underneath the course lecture like with other classes. And what course out of the two is better to take in terms of how study intensive it is. I'm a classics student so I will already be reading a lot but I need one more course and I'm interested in both of these.",

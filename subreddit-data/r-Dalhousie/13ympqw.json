Do whatever you\u2019re comfortable with. For me I\u2019ve lived with my roommate for two years and I still occasionally turn my back to her when I get changed depending on how I\u2019m feeling. But you are going to be living together, meaning you will be spending a lot of time in close proximity with them, whether you like it not.",

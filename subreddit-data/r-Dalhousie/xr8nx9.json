    "postText": "Accidentally dropped a whole pot of food I had prepared for today and tomorrow, into a dirty sink. Had nothing for breakfast due to the food debacle. The lights went out while I was on the toilet, and I had no flashlight nor windows. Fell down a flight of stairs, almost bit my tongue off, maybe broke my nose.  6 minutes late to a test with a 10 minute grace period to start, didn't get to start it. To top it all off, on the way home I punched a tree branch that got caught in my sleeve, and when I tried yanking my arm out, it ripped AT THE SHOULDER of my favourite shirt. And it's only 10:55 AM.\n\nI came to vent here because I didn't want to whine to the only friend I have in Dal. So I'll whine here instead.",

That part is whatever, relatively straightforward.\n\nWhere I am lost is this Dynamic duo + Halifax transit option. It\u2019s 8$/month AND I get a bus pass? Or do I get a discount on bus passes? What is the discount? How do I get it? They provide next to zero information \ud83e\udee0 pls help. My brain hurts.",

You have to call them to register for it I believe, and the plans run for a year from January and July 1st. If you have a U-pass already then you can send them proof to get the plan without buying the bus pass.",

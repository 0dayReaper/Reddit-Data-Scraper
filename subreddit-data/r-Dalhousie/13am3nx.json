You get a nice little living area, a little kitchen spot with a sink mini fridge, and microwave in the suites.\n\nThe 3 and 4 bedroom suites have a larger living area with a kitchen spot (no stove/oven), and have 2 full bathrooms. There is also a large storage room and a small coat closet in these.\n\nIf you're considering the single with shared bath, have a good relationship with who you share the bathroom. The single is a standard door room but you have a washroom that is shared between to single rooms by a door into each. You could get locked out of it if they forget to unlock your rooms door. Every floor has a central single washroom incase this happens.\n\nMy recommendation if you want to be social or have more general space is to go with the suites.",

I only did that because I thought the other room options, you wouldnt have a locked room.\n\nIf i could re-choose, I'd do the 2 or 3 bedroom suite. They have a lot more space, and every private room has a lock. I had a friend throw small parties in their 3 &amp; 4 bedroom suites too, and they fit like 50 people. Lots of room!",

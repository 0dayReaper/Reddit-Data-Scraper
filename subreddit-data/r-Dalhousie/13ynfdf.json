When I was in glengary, you didn\u2019t even have to buy a meal plan which was great as I am a lactose intolerant vegetarian so I didn\u2019t feel like messing around with caf food.",

Used to be on Risley which was good but I went to Glengary because you don\u2019t have a RA breathing down your back, there\u2019s a res manager, usually a 4th year, but the only time I saw them was at the beginning and end of the year or if I had an issue with he apartment, which I rarely did. There is no \u2018lobby\u2019 just the door to the building then stairs to the apartments. There was no RA\u2019s sitting at the doors on weekends, idk if that changed.\n\n\n\nThe vibe of the building is definitely a lot calmer than the typical residences, doesn\u2019t usually has students in first year running around at night. It feels like more of a regular apartment than a dal residence\n\nThe apartments themselves are a bit outdated compared to residences like risley and lemerchant place, but are definitely still up to standard with everything. The floors are a bit creaky though, if the person living above you is heavy footed you will definitely hear them moving around. \n\nMy biggest issue was probably the laundry. They only had 2 washers and 2 dryers for the whole building, idk if they changed that too. \n\nBut overall great res to live in if you enjoy more peace and freedom than what is offered in the traditional residences",

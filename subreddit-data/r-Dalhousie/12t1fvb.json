Better than Quants 1. \nBut if it\u2019s with Milica she makes your life hell in terms of exam standards (60 min to write exam, upload scans of each answer) and you can\u2019t go back to the previous questions. So it\u2019s time crunching all through! If you get stuck you\u2019re screwed!",

I didn\u2019t go to class once last fall and got a 97 on the midterm and a 90 on the final. I studied for about an hour or two for each. Tutorials were graded but I didn\u2019t feel like going so my participation grade was tanked but I got an A.\n\nIntro to quants was harder for me since it was all excel based, but this one was like normal statistics by hand for the most part.\n\nEDIT: I took it Fall 2022",

If you did its surprising that the class average tanked so badly.\n\nThe material for Interm Quants is very easy to learn. I recommend studying Khan Academy lessons, which is how I learned the stats first time around. You can get a headstart by learning about standard deviation, probability, z-scores, and t-tests over the summer. \n\nThe first midterm is excel based, while the final was on paper. Make sure you understand how to do the calculations on excel AND by hand. That was the biggest mistake people in my year made - they expected the final to be excel formulas. Take advantage of your formula sheet during exams, and attend every tutorial and class for your participation mark.\n\nStatistics is simple to get the hang of with some practice! Good luck",

When I did my commerce undergrad at Dal, we had two stats courses but they were called something different than what it is called now, however the second one was the hardest. I know a tutor is expensive, but it\u2019s better to pay a bit extra now to pass, than pay a whole $1k to take the course again. Best of luck my guy, you can do it.",

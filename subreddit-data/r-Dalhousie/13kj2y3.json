Email student accessibility saying that you're interested in proctoring and ask when the applications are and what the title of the job description is on the mycareers site. It's not super consistent, but it pays really well, and.. often you get some downtime where you can study while you're there (win).\n\nAlso do well in your classes and make friends with instructors and you could just get that sweet TA pay for  second year onwards.",

I always saw them studying or watching netflix during their shifts. Super laid back, and with it being only on weekends, you wouldn't have to worry about waking up early the next day.\n\nI was going to suggest a residence front desk but I know for a fact the job posting closed a few months ago. Front desks close at midnight.",

It is dead-quiet most of the nights\u2014 I lived there in my first year and I was not once woken up by someone pulling the fire alarm or talking loudly or anything. Admittedly not the best for interacting with people and making friends, which from what I know has turned a lot of people off of the place, but if you want peace and quiet it\u2019s wonderful (or it was for me at least)\n\nThat being said, it doesn\u2019t have a meal hall and you have to walk to Howe, which is a 4 or so minute walk away, for your meals.",

Everyone very much kept to themselves. It was lonely, but very peaceful.\n\nBeware, though. If your power goes out (as in the hurricane) mini res is not on a generator, and we ended up losing power for 7 straight days.",

I suppose I should take math in order to meet the requirement , however i have only done math in hs in the 11th grade and not 12th. \n\nCan anyone suggest what kind of math courses do i take in order to get into Bsc next year?",

Calculus is required for most BScs. You cannot be accepted into most science programs without completing precal first (kinesiology is the only BSc I'm aware of that doesn't require it).",

The only reason i did not take math in grade 12 was because the call was full lol. So i had no other option i am pretty good at math so hopefully it clearly the requirements if i take these! Thanks alot, just wondering is MATH 1215 a calc course? Since i need pre calc or calc prolly to get into Bsc",

MATH 1215 is calc 1 for health sciences and is generally considered easier and slower, though you learn all the same material. You'll need to take calc for the BSc (and another math, I recommend Calc 2 if you need Integral calc for your degree or STAT 1060 if you dont).",

In this case, you require pre-cal or any equivalent course depending on where you reside. \n\nWith regards to your question \u201ccan I take math courses next year instead\u201d, that is unfortunately not possible, since it is already required to take a math requirement and a statistics requirement preferably during your first year. \n\nIn my opinion, I would start off in the BA program, take the first requirements of a BSc program using your electives and then transfer during your second year. \n\nI do advise you to contact an academic advisor for further guidance. \n\nBest of luck!",

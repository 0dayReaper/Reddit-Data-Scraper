    "postText": "Man... I just witnessed someone try taking their own life outside a gas station. Won't disclose the method, but it was intense to say the least. Upon noticing this me &amp; my friend instantly rushed towards this man &amp; physically pulled him away. He looked to be in his early to mid 30's, in good health &amp; was decently dressed. As much as he was trying to resist, he begun bursting into tears &amp; eventually opened up. Won't go into detail with his situation, but it was deeply family related. We ended up talking for 2 hours &amp; he hashed out his suicidal thoughts. We drove him home &amp; he seemed level-headed enough to be trusted on his own at that point. Ended up exchanging numbers amongst each other &amp; decided to check in once a week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLife is a bitch, but I promise there's better days ahead for all of you. It cost's nothing to ask what someone's been up to or how their day was. Always remember help is available 24/7 &amp; human interaction is one conversation away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDefinitely a crazy night overall &amp; extremely humbled by all of it. Experiencing something like this first hand was truly heartbreaking. I pray anyone going through shit makes it out, peace &amp; love.",

            "comment": "It's bad because there's so little help. In terms of free trauma help, especially, there's so so little and you can't get it through the public health system. Dal is particularly bad at supporting mentally ill students and trauma survivors. The public mental health system (eg hrm or ns) is deplorable compared to a lot of provinces. \n\nI heard the it gets better advice for many consecutive years as things got substantially worse. My \"tough times\" we horrible for most of my life. It doesn't get better if there's no ongoing helpful support and treatment. Especially when you're subjected to ongoing verbal abuse and consistently blamed for a condition you didn't ask for, weren't born with, and there's next to no help for\n\nWe have very little support for people struggling with suicidal urges here, as well. It's entirely pointless to go to the hospital when you feel that way. This has been the experience of every person I've known who went for this type of support.",

You literally saved a person\u2019s life and you make me wish there were more people like you. Sadly in this generation, there would have been a few people who would have stood there in shock or even recorded a video instead. But what you did there my friend, deserves the utmost praise. People like you make the world better.",

I feel like everyone has had thoughts about giving up on life at some point or another, but not to this extent. I truly believe mental health awareness needs to become a focal point going forward especially with the technology &amp; outreach we have in today's world. I just want to set the best example possible &amp; inspire those around me. Better days ahead.",

I\u2019ve heard stories of those who haven\u2019t sadly.\n\nMost notably, I know a friend who worked at Tim Hortons on the Waterfront few years back. Once they had some disheveled guy come in and ask for a knife. They gave him a plastic butter knife but he wanted something sharper. Seeing that the man seemed off, my friend refused to give them a kitchen knife. Later that man went next door and bought a sharp knife from the gift shop. \n\nAs my friend ended his shift, they saw a bunch of fire trucks near the bus stop and EMS. Turns out the man bought the knife and slit his throat in the nearby bus stop. Fire crews had to spend the day washing away the blood.",

At the end of the day all we got is each other. You never know what the smallest deed might do for someone.",

    "postText": "Currently applying to residence and I live out of province. Howe Hall: What\u2019s the difference in all the houses besides fountain house having sinks. Like do some have bigger rooms/better accommodations. I love the look of sherif aesthetically but I\u2019m trying to make friends and people say Howe and Risley are more social hot spots. Do people go to different residences to party? What are the downsides to each residences?",

Howe hall and risley are the most social but I would say if you are gonna live in Howe Cameron hall is the worst one by far. I lived in Cameron last year and I couldn\u2019t sit at my desk without my chair pressed against my bed and room is very tiny.",

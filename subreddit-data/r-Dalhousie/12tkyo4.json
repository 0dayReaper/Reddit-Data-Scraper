If you really had grades in the 90's for everything else in statics, you don't even need to worry about the exam. You would only have to get around 5% or so on the exam correct to pass given your situation, or maybe slightly higher depending. \n\nTO be fair, the focus in that course is passing. I don't find it to be one of those GPA booster courses like chemistry/physics/communications are.",

It's a union position, so they likely won't even start looking at resumes until after the deadline has passed.\n\nI can't speak to Psych's hiring process, but I know Engineering does this (or at least, they *did* do this in the past) to avoid giving any sort of first mover advantage to early applicants. All applications get reviewed at the same time, and then they decide on callbacks for interviews from there.",

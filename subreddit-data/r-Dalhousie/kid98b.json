    "postText": "Honestly, I feel like I have reached an impasse with my program and Dalhousie. For context, I am a first-year student in a master's program. The whole experience has been mediocre even with the main exogenous factor, COVID, taken into account. \n\nI knew that there would not be any in-person social interaction, but I at least expected that there would be some form of rapport to be had with one's colleagues through virtual means. So far, my program has had four events, a rate of one per month, including orientation. I don't know if I am the only one, but it feels completely desolate. \n\nThat being said, my biggest complaint so far is the professors. For the most part, they have been absolutely brutal. I feel like I have barely learned anything, and it is quite evident that many of them spent scantly any time preparing their material. Furthermore, I am just astonished at how lackluster the material is from a pedagogical standpoint. There is very little feedback given on assignments, which are often returned weeks late. Holding an office hour has gone by the wayside, and getting the time of day from them is treated as a burden. The complete lack of empathy that they have for their students is utterly bewildering to me. \n\nI am also not at all impressed by the university. In the limited interactions that I have had with various services, they have been either aloof or unreachable. In my opinion, there is a glaring discrepancy between what is broadcast by the university and what is actually being done for students. I still can't get over how much fees have increased for this year. \n\nMy apologies for the rant; I am just curious if this is the standard that Dalhousie holds itself at? Is anyone else in the same boat? \n\nAt this point, I would rather just cut my losses and apply elsewhere.",

            "comment": "Yeah the professors have really been slacking. I understand it\u2019s a new atmosphere for everyone but not replying to emails for weeks on end is unacceptable. It\u2019s been challenging for everyone but the rate of feedback provided has been way worse even accounting for the difficulties faced online. I think the fact that professors can kind of do whatever they want with no consequences has also lead to this. On your final note however, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much difference here then any other U15 university. The fees are ridiculous, the profs are usually just as non-communicative especially during this online thing. \n\nWe don\u2019t really have much of a choice then just accept it I suppose.",

            "comment": "One thing I can agree with you is that the turnaround for grades is very long compared to last year. I am not really sure what is taking so long? The instructors made it very clear in my courses that the due dates are not negotiable for the final assignments well in advance, so I can only assume that 99% of the students submitted them on time. I wonder why it is taking so long for them (professors + TA's) to grade our work? It usually does not take so long.",

Even if most markers have completed their work, they can't post it until all marking is done. With things being online, I wouldn't be surprised if there are some TA's who are finding it harder to motivate themselves to do their work. (Not that that's okay - of course they should be responsible no matter what.)\n\nAlso I noticed that some classes have absurd amounts of TA's this semester. I heard that a course had 14 TA's/markers - yet I'd been the sole TA/marker for that same course multiple times in the past, with no issues. Any time more people are brought on board, the odds of there being a marker that slows things down goes up.",

            "comment": "What program are you in?\n\nI started a master\u2019s program at a different school, but a program at Dal was on the short short list. One of the reasons I decided against Dal was that the faculty kept stating they would very likely return to in-person in January. I found that difficult to believe and after reaching out to several current students and faculty members it became apparent that the program would probably be online for its entire duration. However, the public messaging remained the same aka going back to in person ASAP. Although an impossible situation to navigate, I would have appreciated transparency rather than promising words that are unrealistic.\n\nI ended up going with a program at a different school where the faculty decided in July to move the program online and keep it online for its duration. It made it much easier to plan ahead and I appreciated the commitment. \n\nWhile online grad school has its challenges and not all profs are thriving in this new environment, I must say I\u2019ve had a fantastic experience in my first term. Instructors and faculty members have been extremely supportive and resourceful. I know I can reach out to anyone and will get support fast. Profs have been responsive and flexible. Though a hard program with a tight schedule, I feel like I\u2019ve been learning a lot. \n\nIt\u2019s a small program (15 students) and I\u2019ve gotten to know everyone as we have many team projects and video calls with peers happen several times a week. Now that the term is over, we\u2019ll get together for a social call this week to talk about something else but school :) \n\nIn summary, I think an online masters during Covid doesn\u2019t have to be the way you\u2019ve described it and I think if you feel like your needs as a graduate student are not being met, I would personally consider changing schools/programs.",

            "comment": "The quality of education at Dal can be hit or miss. Some programs educate their students very well and have engaged professors While others simply don't and it seems like the administration and department heads don't really even understand the difference. Even within programs there can be significant variability in the quality of education you're receiving. I would take your concerns directly to the head of your department and CC the highest ranking administration official you can get an email for. Lay your complaints out in a concrete manner and use specific examples. Make sure they know you're saying that they've failed you. Sometimes that will spur everyone into action and you'll get some results but you may just need to transfer.",

            "comment": "I don't know if this will help, but I wanted to share my experiences with the three specific things you mentioned. This is because when one of these things is great, it can usually offset shortfalls in the other two. So it's really sad to hear you've had a poor experience with all three.\n\nRegarding social interactions, these have taken a hit in my program largely due to COVID. Not only is it harder to come up with and host events (and these are often offloaded by the dept to the student societies), but COVID seems to have exacerbated the existing organizational and communication problems. So, even though the intentions are good, things aren't always carried out effectively.\n\nRegarding professors, I can't say I've had the same experience. My department has been very open to suggestions on how to improve throughout COVID and has actually implemented things that they could. With other more systemic issues, change is very slow (due to politics) but they are trying. So this sounds like a program specific issue. If you feel like giving feedback to the dept head/chair that might help, but it may not and also may not be something you feel comfortable doing.\n\nRegarding Dal, I tend to agree with you in some areas. While there are some people and groups that really care about grad students, there is a lot of apathy from the Dal administration because they seem to care more about appearances and the bottom line, and from older, more \"traditional\" professors who seem to resist change at every turn. I did not feel like this at my previous university but I also don't know if I was as aware of these problems in academia. Again COVID has made this more noticeable and I know that universities across the country have handled it poorly in some areas, but I really felt like Dal dropped the ball with it's consideration of grad students specifically. One thing that just baffles me is how hard they say they try to provide mental health services, and while there are some great initiatives, I just don't understand why counselling is so hard to access compared to other universities. Our health benefits and TA pay are also worse that other institutions but that may also be a Nova Scotia thing.",

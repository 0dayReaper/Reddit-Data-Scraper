    "postText": "Hello :)\n\nI'm 20 and am just starting my path of education. I want a family at some point in my life, but I'm confident I will make it work. I've made peace with the fact of many years of studying to become an architect and educating myself well. \n\nI am starting my route by getting a tech diploma. Hoping this will give me a very solid foundation of knowledge and building my portfolio, I am unsure which path to go within my diploma option at SAIT; Civil Engineering Tech or Architectural Tech. My ideal school to study architecture at would be Dalhousie, but I will definitely be applying to multiple.\n\nAny recent grads of either programs that are able to give insight and comments on the program would be greatly, greatly appreciated. I'm very interested in the future of smart buildings and renewable energy storage systems. I know SAIT CET you get to learn concrete tech and more \"in the ground stuff\", but I am thinking an architecture school would appreciate much more of a focus on the built environment above ground. Please let me know your opinion! Any comments help :)",

Dal didn\u2019t give me a lot of credits when I transferred from technology to an engineering program. I had to basically start my degree again, and imo it sucks. I\u2019m not really sure about Architecture tho. I\u2019d suggest you, try to find schools that accept credits from a technology program if you mind starting your degree again from year 1.",

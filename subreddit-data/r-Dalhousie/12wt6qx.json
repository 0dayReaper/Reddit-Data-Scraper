You would have plenty of opportunities outside of those as well. I am still in my last year and I already have a job lined up for when I graduate.\n\n2) Barely any math, one of the main reasons I switched to ACS from CS was so I didn't have to do any more. The only math class I took for CS is now an elective for my ACS degree.\n\n3) \"Requirements\nMinimum overall average: 70%,\nAcademic English 12,\nAcademic Math 12,\nThree additional academic subjects\"\n\n4) Not super competitive, there are a lot of students, but there are also a lot of seats open. You probably won't have a hard time getting in as long as you meet the above requirements.",

Math at Dalhousie is pretty interesting stuff, and not what you would expect. \n\nThat said, I entered the ACS program and after one year I switched into the BCS program. \n\nYou say you suck at math, but you're likely ONLY exposed to math that is not interesting or motivating to learn. So keep that in mind. \n\nDalhousie is competitive in general, so yes.\n\nThis course starts today  and is free, if you want to tip your toes : https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x",

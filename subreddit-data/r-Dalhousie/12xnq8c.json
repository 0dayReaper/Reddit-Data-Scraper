            "comment": "It's hard to get ahead with these classes, especially 2402 since it builds basically entirely on the last topic of 2401 so I would just recommend you go to class and keep up with the practice questions as you go along and you'll be fine. 2401 didn't do slides except for one topic it was basically just the prof writing on her iPad and everyone copying whatever she said. You will be totally fine in both as long as you go to class and do as many practice problems as you can don't worry.",

            "comment": "If you really want to get ahead, for 2401 you could look up some stuff on the chair conformation and isomers (configurational, enantiomers, diastereomers, etc.). I definitely recommend buying the supplemental notes for 2401 as the practice tests are really helpful for the exams. Like the other commenter said though, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine if you just enjoy your summer now and stay focused when class starts in the fall",

If you\u2019re looking to get a head start, make sure you understand the basic principles of acid base chemistry and stereochemistry. Otherwise, enjoy your summer and be prepared to put in the work.",

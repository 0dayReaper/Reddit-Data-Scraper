    "postText": "Hello ,\n\nI am currently doing my nursing at CBU ( originally from Halifax ) but want to transfer back to Dalhousie \\`s nursing program.  I asked admission but everyone is on vacation so just wounding if anybody from Reddit knows that , are you allowed to transfer from other University to Dal ?   any requirements for GPAs or Caspers ? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

It's competitive and you'd have to apply with everyone else as there's no separate transfer option. You wouldn't get in until next year at the earliest and by that time you can be halfway through at CBU. You would complete the degree at the same time.\n\nWhatever is driving your thinking on transfer needs to be considered but the stressors associated with school are temporary and likely present wherever you go.",

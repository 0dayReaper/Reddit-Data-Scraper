    "postText": "I just got my residence offer and got mini res. I'm a first year. Just wondering what the general opinion and reputation is for mini res as I haven't heard much about it. It wasn't even on my list but I applied a couple days before the deadline so I can't complain. I just need to know if its a good place for me as a first year or if I need to put in a request to transfer lol.",

            "comment": "Statistically, your transfer request won't be processed until the winter semester, if at all.\n\nRez is full, so they need to process all temp housing, all emergency moves, and all medical moves before they can start on the first-come-first-served transfer list. This usually doesn't happen until November, after W Day.\n\nMinires tends to be quiet. In the past, it was predominantly offered to grad students when the grad residences filled up, and returning undergrad students. It's a very independent style of res, more like apartment living. You'll generally be going out to party, but this will depend entirely on who you get as your neighbours.",

Tbf it also tended to be significantly more clean than a lot of other residences I visited. If you find it easy to make friends/making friends isn\u2019t a priority for you and you like a quiet red experience I wouldn\u2019t worry about a minires assignment, but if it is I\u2019d probably request a transfer.",

I am definitely biased, but I loved Mini. It's much closer to apartment-style living than most other dorms, and unless you really keep to yourself you will become very close with some of the other people you live with.",

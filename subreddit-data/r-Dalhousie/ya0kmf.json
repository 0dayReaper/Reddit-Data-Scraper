An undergrad who complains about not having a job yet all you manage to do in every comment section about this issue is put down TAs, markers and other CUPE members.\n\nWhen you're done your undergrad you will be so sad when you realize that you can't get food or shelter because TAs still make 24 an hour and that's the job you get in grad school.\n\nHow about you realize that by dal increasing TA wages it:\n\na) costs you nothing personally as fee schedules are pretty much set in stone for the remainder of your degree. \n\nb) will secure you a good quality education for the remainder of your undergrad. \n\nThe quality of your education will dwindle if this issue doesn't get addressed. I've been at dal for 4 years and all I can say is that teaching quality is getting progressively shittier than it was before and a lot of that is due to unfair compensation of TAs. One of my courses has no TAs despite having tutorials scheduled. After this strike, it only gets better.\n\nc) will increase the wage that YOU can earn in the future if you become a TA. \n\nThere is literally no benefit for you to carry this opinion unless you lack the capacity to endure mild inconveniences for future reward.",

It would be so wonderful if everyone had all the money but that's not the way the fucking world works lmao. Do they make 24? I read 27,! That's 14 above minimum ! And if they're science students their post graduate studies are paid for wowza. Average ta pay in Canada is 25~ \n\nHow about you realize I'm getting fucked by this and I have an issue with it. I'm not going to weigh who is getting more fucked with you but I'm actually just beginning my degree and paying up the ass for it. I'm not getting paid at all.",

Although the number sounds good, it\u2019s actually not because we are super limited to how much we can work in a semester as we are expected to put the majority of our time into research (some of us not getting a research stipend for it either but that\u2019s a separate issue). For example, common TA contracts are 45h or 90h for a semester and you can only TA a few hours a week. This doesn\u2019t end up in a lot of money\u2026 especially since some faculty will actually consider you a TA for half the hours (earning $24/h) and a marker/demonstrator for the second half (earning $16/h) which seriously reduces the pay as well. \n\nThe average TA pay among the U15s is approx $35/h which is what the TAs are asking for I believe. Keep in mind that many universities are actually pay their TAs nearly double what we\u2019re being paid currently. Also, a while other thing to think of is the part time academics (the folks who teach a LOT of courses at Dal). They make the worst wage compared to all U15 universities in Canada. \n\nWhere would the money come from? Definitely not students. Dal has a $67million surplus from 2021-2022 that you can find on page 1 of their 2021-2022 financial report. They have the money. It is worth noting that your tuition money goes to paying the president half a million dollars a year as a salary as well as paying for his house, private car and insurance, phone and internet, and his golf membership.\n\nI don\u2019t really understand the \u201cthey\u2019re so greedy perspective\u201d when there are literally TAs telling the student body that they can barely afford rent or groceries and have to work multiple jobs. They\u2019re very open about their direct experiences which isn\u2019t really something that is arguable.",

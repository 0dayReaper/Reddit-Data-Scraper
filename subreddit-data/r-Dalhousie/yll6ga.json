If Dal does not finally solve this issue, many students will be tremendously affected in a very negative way. \n\nTHIS IS FOR OUR FUTURE PATHS AND CAREERS. \n\nFor example: many med schools across the country require applicants to be full time students, in a case in which courses are suspended and not given credit for, many students will be affected. \n\nTHIS IS UNFAIR! We students, pay all what is required and want to learn, we don\u2019t deserve to be treated in this selfish and unprofessional manner for the sake of $$$. \n\nIT IS TIME TO SACRIFICE DAL, TIME FOR CHANGE.",

I did not even mention all of our amazing international students. Ugh this is a mess.\n\nAlso, I would like to clarify that although I\u2019m so beyond frustrated at all of this, I 100% support our CUPE 3912 staff. This is an absolute wast of everyone\u2019s time. I have dealt with strikes before (I have a gov union job) so I totally understand that for a strike to work there has to be pressure, and pretty much everyone (seemingly, aside from the institution) suffers in the interim. But you are absolutely right, we need to apply the pressure back to the institution for ourselves, and for CUPE.\n\nI wish we had more media coverage as well. Dal is a big deal for Halifax.\n\nDal giving the CUPE workers livable wage and good working conditions will set a precedent that makes it easier for all other bargaining units to do the same. And that would be very sad for them. /s",

For example they went 3 years without a Payrise, I worked in a supermarket in the UK and I got a pay increase 3 times in 11 months. \n\nOne of my lectures in ASSC1800 has said roughly speaking that if the strike goes in longer then a month after that he will expect the uni to start making changes to courses such as decreasing the weight of marks in some areas and increasing them in others. Or giving marks for attendance when the strike is/was happening.\n\nWhat I think cupe are trying to do is have the biggest impact they can on the uni, but I got told by a lecturer in my web design class that they may bring in external markers, I just hope that they make themselves fluent in the course materials as if they don't then to me they have marked incorrectly",

If they bring in Scabs to complete CUPEs duties, they will undermine their own union. \n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the professors union to not do work that is assigned to another union. Remember the professors are likely striking in a few months time, they are, generally speaking, supportive of pressuring Dalhousie for fair wages. \n\n\n\nBe careful about letting your professors change the syllabus. A change to the legally binding course syllabus requires 2/3rds majority to ascend - without that they are responsible to provide what they outlined. If you allow your professor to change the syllabus you are likely forfeiting the ability to later contest the grade or receive a refund as you'll no longer be in a position where you received something else besides what you paid for, you'll be negotiating a new contract. \n\n\n\nPlease review some of your rights as a student, and only accept changes to the course if they benefit everyone.",

I did my undergrad here and I'm now doing a PhD here. But they increase tuition by 3% every year and I don't think we ever really see that money go anywhere meaningful. They're stingy with teaching staff and faculty. The LSC, which is where one of Dal's flagship undergrad majors is taught (marine biology), gets filled with puddles and leaks every single time it rains and is in serious need of extensive repairs. But they're building an ice rink apparently? The president gets a big fat raise and a paid private golf membership? There's this massive surplus in their budget that they don't seem to want to spend on actual improvements to the university or on the people responsible for giving the university its strong reputation.",

They've likely been at Dal longer than I have, and have a better idea specific to your department about the situation.\n\nIf you're interested, I can also look up some email addresses to give you if you want to write an email expressing your disappointment and how you're reconsidering Dal over the current situation.

You can tell it\u2019s important to Dal admin per the emphasis on this \u2018distinctions\u2019 in their emails. Someone posted a graph at one point showing the relative increase in marker positions vs decreasing TA positions. \n\nI can\u2019t stress this enough, but CUPEs demands are more than fair, especially considering how much bs the school puts us through. It\u2019s literally not even a reach, and just demands that the institution that teaches us about ethics and shit can walk the walk instead of giving university execs 60 000 dollar raises. Honestly, in my opinion, CUPE and the students should demand way more. The university\u2019s literally been taking advantage of us. Mandatory meal plans (with whacko prices compared to quality), mandatory textbooks, mandatory external programs that charge us more for something Brightspace can do, whacko tuition, etc. They can eat shit for all I care. A university is only as good as its treatment of its most \u201cunimportant\u201d workers.",

When I was a TA, I was only paid at the TA rate whether I was marking or lecturing - I wasn\u2019t a TA one day and a marker the next for the same course, and I appreciate that departments doing that are ripping people off. \n\nThat said, I do think that TAing is more skilled work with more responsibilities than just marking; TAs can mark, but not necessarily vice versa. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inherently wrong to pay people more for more scarce labour, but maybe it\u2019s a reasonable compromise to only keep the positions split so long as all parties are treated fairly (i.e., paid fair wages, paid for each hour of work done, paid according to position and not the type of work done - TAs marking should still be paid as TAs). \n\nWhether they keep separate roles or not, I agree with the motivations of the strike and think that all teaching staff deserve fair pay and conditions. I thought TAing was a sweet gig when I was in undergrad, but that was a lot of inflation and tuition ago and my department treated me fairly, unlike some of the scenarios I\u2019ve heard recently.",

When I TA\u2019d, marking was part of my TA hours (**IF** I was marking, sometimes the prof or a marker did it), and if my hours were running short a plan would be made to address the remaining course work without uncompensated labour. A TA should be getting TA rates for whatever work they do for a course, and a marker shouldn\u2019t be doing anything but marking. It\u2019s asinine to hire the same person as marker and TA for the same course, and I have been disappointed learning that a number of departments at Dal have been treating their teaching staff like this.",

As a newbie who would get into debt, this will be a nightmare. My only hope is that it somehow gets resolved magically and I still get some time to send applications without worries.\n\nEdit: rereading your top comment, I realised that you're already going through what I asked you about.",

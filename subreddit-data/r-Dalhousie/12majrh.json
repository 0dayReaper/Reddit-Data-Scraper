A 3.7/4.3 is equivalent to averaging an A- in all courses. \n\nYou can read more about the grading scale [here](https://www.dal.ca/campus_life/academic-support/grades-and-student-records/grade-scale-and-definitions.html). I will say that maintaining a 3.7 in diploma years can be tough given the breadth and volume of content in courses, but it is doable if you\u2019re disciplined and manage your time effectively.",

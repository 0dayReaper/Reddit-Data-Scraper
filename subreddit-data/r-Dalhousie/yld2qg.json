They have been tabling and engaging in other outreach efforts since mid-August on Dalhousie campus indicating that there is a significant non-zero chance they will be striking this fall. A day before CUPE 3912 announced their intentions to strike, we asked if there is a contingency plan. The response was that they are able to plan to *make one* if there is a strike but feel very confident and hope it won't get to that stage. Once we were already amid the strike, I asked what happens if we lose the semester. Again, I was told they were confident it won't get to that stage.",

That designation is a loophole the university uses to pay us less for the same amount of work. If you are in a second year biology class, the person running your lab got TA pay last year and demonstrator pay this year, for the same job. That's a reduction of 1/3 in pay. I myself have also been victimized by the demonstrator/TA loophole. SEASIDE demonstrators get it even worse, because we have to have first aid training as well as supervise field trips AND labs. That's extra training and duties that most TAs don't have, for 8$ less per hour.",

I *do* think it\u2019s exploitative to knock TA work into marker and demonstrator roles to pay them less; if you\u2019re supervising or teaching students directly, you should be a TA. A marker should just be marking, a demonstrator should just be demonstrating (although tbh it seems to me like demonstrator is a very narrow role that would obviously be egregiously expanded, such as in your case - I would not be opposed to putting demonstration under TA responsibilities). \n\nIf the union can enforce an agreement that means TA work is getting TA rates, I would support keeping the roles separate (with better pay in both cases). Otherwise, it serves as a way to protect union members from being undervalued for their work - nobody should be getting marker pay and doing more than marking and entering grades.",

In my dept., markers are told very clearly that it isn\u2019t their job to respond to student emails, and to just forward them to the prof. A marker should just grade work and provide feedback - if students want clarification or extra marks, they can take it up with somebody in a pay grade that is responsible for dealing with them. If the feedback isn\u2019t good, that\u2019s still up to somebody higher up to rectify and forcing a bad marker into a broader role isn\u2019t good for anybody. \n\nThe system worked well in my department, but they followed these principles on good faith rather than abusing loopholes to cut costs. Some of the things that go into assessing students absolutely goes beyond the skills required to compare work to a rubric, and it benefits everybody to separate those where appropriate.",

The email from the acting Assistant Vice-President, Chris Hattie (chris.hattie@dal.ca) said \"We have made real and meaningful progress towards bringing wages for all classifications in line with regional and national comparators.\" This line is meaningless, considering CUPE is demanding wage PARITY for TAs and PTAs compared to the U15, a point of pride for Dal and its promise to be world class going into its 3rd century of existence. \n\nCUPE also insists on wage parity between Marker/Demonstrators and TAs, since departments such as biology and computer science are converting TA positions to Markers as a cost-saving measure, despite the duties being the same as traditional TA roles. Chris Hattie said \"we strongly believe that having distinct roles within our CUPE membership, with appropriate compensation for those different roles, is a fair and accurate reflection of the duties being performed across the university\" which clearly serves drive a wedge between roles within CUPE and devalues the difficult and time intensive work that Marker/Demonstrators do.",

Dalhousie thinks they can slap us around and provide us with barely above minimum wage compensation. The TA pay i got prior to my demotion was barely enough to account for Halifax\u2019s cost of living. Markers and Demos are just as valuable as TAs and Dal is just choosing to ignore us even though we run the university \ud83d\ude2d\n\nIf Chris thinks marking for 300 students in a first year class should result in less compensation than a TA running a 24 person lab, then he is surely mistaken.

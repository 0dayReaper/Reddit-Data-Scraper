    "postText": "I am still a high school student planning on going into Dalhousie Engineering for the fall and winter terms of 2023-24, so this question would only apply for after my first year. I've read some reviews that make it seem that co-ops at Dalhousie are perhaps not the easiest to manage so I want to try to get ahead of the curve to maximize my opportunities. I can't lie, my resume doesn't look the best but I pride myself in being academically skilled high school student. What should I expect and how can I start to look at co-ops at Dal to set myself up better in the future?",

            "comment": "DAL has a co-op program and a team dedicated to finding opportunities for students. The official co-op program doesn\u2019t start until after your third year of university (varies a bit depending upon discipline). So really you still have a few years to figure something out. \n\nFinding a co-op placement as a student with average or better grades really isn\u2019t that hard. A lot of employers come into the program. When they enter they interview a number of students and rank them. So the company is getting a student somewhat regardless of who those ranked #1. It\u2019s a bit hard to explain. \n\nBut the main take away is it\u2019s still years away before the co-op program really begins.",

            "comment": "Definitely do co-op. Myself and a lot of my classmates got our first jobs out of coops. It also means you get to try out different positions and different industries for 4-months (sometimes 8, depending on the discipline).\n\nI've interviewed and hired several co-op students now. I look at academics, extra curricular, but mostly I base it on the interviews. All the students will have similar experience, especially for the first one. It's really more about how I get on with them and how much they are willing to learn. My expectations are usually pretty low to be honest, as long as they don't make my day harder and they learn something, I consider it a success.\n\nYou're a ways away from having to worry about it, just keep keep going and the university will walk you through the process.",

            "comment": "Make sure your resume is top-notch, even if you don't have a lot of experience. Use a template that is simple, clear, and easy to read. The employers know that you have little to no engineering experience, so try to show how your skills from past experiences will translate to engineering jobs. I struggled to find a co-op job for a while until I got some help making my resume look and sound better. After that, I was getting interview requests left and right.\n\nI highly recommend co op. You gain experience that you won't get in the classroom.",

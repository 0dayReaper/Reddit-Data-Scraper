Vaccine coverage dropping from 80% to 17% in children for inner common vaccine. Some other interesting numbers in the article. \n\nEither way, like I said above, there are a lot of Canadians that don't trust public health now. It has nothing to do with people going around spreading the \"word\" and has everything to do with government messaging and actions. \n\nJust my 2 cents.

Why? I'm a native man and I'm not getting first in line for an untested drug. And here we are in winter of 2022 and guess what? They are warning you to get your influenza shot? No longer your covid shot, maderna shot, or what ever you want to call it, but influenza shot? It was bound to come back into fashion! So we are back to worrying about the \"flu\"? \nAs a native I answer your question by this reply. We have been not trusting the government for over 500 years, you shouldn't either. It takes over 5 years to manufacture and test a vaccine but they have one in less than a year? Approved by government appointed doctors? When I was a kid we called them puppets! :)",

Suddenly birth defects unlike any have seen? \nNothing suspicious about any of that? Let's not get into Bill and Melinda Gates being interviewed and Melinda stating that natives and blacks get the shots first? We were given smallpox blankets a few generations ago, never forgot that! Why is a vaccine being segregated? Why has the vaccine been developed in such a short time when it takes up to five years to develop a vaccine for any other virus? So with that information you can develop your own opinion but that doesn't give you the right to impose your view on others. It means you used your own logic to form your own opinion.

    "postText": "I hate this year.\n\nEverything is more expensive. I paid $70 to RENT a shitty \"interactive textbook\" for a year. We also have to sign up for an outside language tutor to practise speaking, which is an additional $50 - but not $50CAD, no, $50USD. And what an idiot I am to get that confused; it's in the syllabus (it's not). \n\nI dropped one class because it was just pdfs of a previous prof's slides that clearly were meant to go with a lecture for further explanation.\n\nI just feel like we've been cut adrift with some jenky PowerPoints and an empty discussion board and I could learn just as much with a Great Courses Plus subscription. We are paying more and getting substantially less and I'm rude to point it out.\n\nIf there were any jobs available (I applied for dozens in July /August) then I would defer, but I can't afford to. I need the student loan.\n\nAnd what if the faculty strikes? I would totally support them, because wtf why is Dal trying to REDUCE their salaries when they are all working way harder to figure out this online stuff?? It's so greedy, I'm furious but I'm also trapped. \n\nThank you for coming to my ted talk",

I hate that students bare the consequences of this. Some profs, like any other humans, are going through personal hard times, although most are doing their best. \n\nSo, vent away, you are reasonable to do so. Vent where it matters too. And take care of yourself. \n\nAlso : the prospect of getting our salary cut is demoralizing. But my guess is that it won't happen. Faculty is paid well, but most are working extraordinarily hard in return. I hope that we'll skip the strike thing altogether for a third time in a row. So I suggest to take things one day at the time.",

Some profs are stretched too thin trying to take on extra students to make up for cancelled classes in the department. Some should have been assigned more TAs. Some are more effective with in person classes because of their dynamic style and interaction. One of my profs is very low tech - all of our assignments were handwritten submissions in person. She's working so hard to figure out brightspace and collaborate and tophat and is doing a great job, but this is all new to her. \n\nI just think the university should have invested in more teaching support staff and maybe come up with a plan to standardize class delivery.

People have complained about Dal keeping the tuition raise and facility fees, but the reality is that the university still has to pay for things and enrolment has dropped.\n\nWhat is really outrageous is that faculty salary cuts were suggested alongside senior administrative salary freezes. God forbid the admins get paid any less, even if faculty funding is reduced.

This year everything is online and I can see profs struggling with delivering the material online. Last week I started the week with 12 hours of videos lectures and another 4 hours supporting material for the week and numerous written PDF\u2019s for my 4 classes. That\u2019s not including reading textbooks and/or homework and discussions. Unfortunately to deliver the material online takes longer than in the classroom in my opinion. Being in my last year I\u2019m use to university obviously and I feel bad for the freshman starting out and students that have never experienced on line material. I also feel bad for profs that are struggling to deliver what has to be delivered. We have all inherited an unforeseen event that has disrupted the world. High school students, graduate students, researchers, administrators are all trying to adjust. I feel for all the students here at Dal and at other institutions of high learning. My view is Let\u2019s work together and make the best of it, use resources that are available like TA\u2019s, group meetings on social media, academic advising, etc and hopefully we will be back together by this winter or spring and get our degrees with classroom learning.",

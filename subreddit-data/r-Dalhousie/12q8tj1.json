The dorms are slightly more spacious and have WAY more storage, and they also come with a sink as Risley does. The bathrooms are so much nicer and everyone is super chill. A bunch of my friends lived there so I\u2019ve seen their rooms and also just met people by visiting the residence, and everyone is easy to get along with",

It\u2019s still not bad, though, because once you get into the LSC you could take the tunnels to Killam, and then just cross the street to the McCain if you have classes there. You could take a similar route to get to the Rowe or CS building as well",

First few days just put yourself out there and introduce yourself to your neighbours and you should be fine. Like I said before I didn\u2019t even live there but found it super friendly and welcoming and a couple of my friends (who I met during my first few weeks) lived there, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably easy to make friends there too. Most people don\u2019t know anyone so everyone is looking to make friends :-)",

If anything things were a little more clique-ish in Risley, like people find they\u2019re group and stick to it because it\u2019s so big, but because Newcombe is so small the whole area is friendly lol. Honestly I didn\u2019t hate Risley and some people love it, and that definitely wasn\u2019t me\u2026 I didn\u2019t like it, but didn\u2019t hate it. I didn\u2019t really like the layout of the dorm, and again preferred those in Newcombe. The storage in Risley also sucks and there\u2019s way more space for stuff in Newcombe dorms. Also, the bathrooms in Risley (I lived on the \u201cparty\u201d floor, so on my floor especially) are so nasty lol half of the stalls were broken and then no one knew how to flush apparently, and guys (I\u2019d assume guys) would pee all over the seats. The bathrooms don\u2019t get cleaned on weekends, so that\u2019s gross. The ones in Newcombe are nicer because (although I went WAY less than I did in Risley) a) there was never pee all over the seat, and the toilets were always flushed b) there\u2019s always one of those boxes for period products (only 2 stalls in my wing\u2019s bathroom had them in Risley) and c) they just looked nicer\u2026? Like the general layout and how they were renovated made them \u201cprettier\u201d I guess lol. The showers also are nicer and I think had a little elevated spot (but I could be wrong). Some nights in Risley during the week people were yelling in the halls past midnight, and I\u2019m fairly certain that happened much less in Newcombe lol. That also depends on your floor for Risley though, since I was on the much louder one. Basically my reasons for disliking Risley come down to personal preference and there wasn\u2019t really anything atrocious. I managed to live there for ~8 months lol",

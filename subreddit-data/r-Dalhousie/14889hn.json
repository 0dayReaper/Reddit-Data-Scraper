I was wondering if they are safe to consume or should I dispose of the entire packet? Is 5 second rule applicable or is it just a myth without any scientific evidence?\n\n\nEdit: I purchased a new batch of assorted M&amp;M's from Walmart \ud83c\udf89. Very excited!!!!",

            "comment": "Greetings, Redditors!\n\nAs a highly accomplished food safety expert with multiple advanced degrees and a wealth of experience in groundbreaking research, I feel compelled to address the matter of the notorious \"5-second rule\" with the utmost seriousness and unparalleled knowledge.\n\nAllow me to enlighten you concisely. The 5-second rule, although widely discussed, lacks substantial scientific evidence to support its validity. Through meticulous studies, it has been unequivocally demonstrated that the duration of contact between dropped food and a contaminated surface is not the sole determinant of its safety.\n\nFactors such as the nature of the food, the characteristics of the surface, and the presence of harmful pathogens must also be taken into account. Bacteria and microorganisms can swiftly adhere to food upon contact, even within a matter of seconds, posing potential health risks.\n\nThus, in the unfortunate incident involving your freshly dropped packet of assorted M&amp;M's, retrieving them within 5.5 seconds does not fully negate the possibility of bacterial contamination. Therefore, it is strongly advised to exercise caution and discard the entire packet to minimize the potential for foodborne illnesses.\n\nRemember, prioritizing food safety is crucial, particularly with perishable and high-moisture foods like your beloved M&amp;M's. By refraining from consuming food that has come into contact with unsanitary surfaces, you actively safeguard your well-being and that of those around you.\n\nIn conclusion, let us embrace the indisputable truth: the 5-second rule lacks scientific credibility. It is prudent to dispose of any food that has been in contact with questionable surfaces. By doing so, you demonstrate a firm commitment to preserving your health and upholding the principles of food safety.\n\nStay safe, fellow Redditors!",

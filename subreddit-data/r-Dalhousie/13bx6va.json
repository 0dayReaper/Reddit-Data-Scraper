What's life like in Halifax vs Ottawa? How does the student life compare, academics, job possibilities, and is living car-free reasonable here?",

From my experience (other than the hills) it\u2019s a pretty walkable city, I haven\u2019t needed to use a car in the 8 months of first year so far",

            "comment": "Coming from someone who studied at BOTH uOttawa and Dal, I can say that I enjoy Halifax 1000% more than Ottawa. Halifax is significantly more walkable in the peninsula compared to Ottawa and although our transit system isn\u2019t as comprehensive, it gets the job done. The student life at uO was also soooo much worse than at Dal (in my experience). uOttawa felt much more like an unfriendly commuter school while Dal is much more akin to the quintessential university experience I envisioned when applying to schools. I can\u2019t speak for the environmental science program but I did coop with my program and Dal and got a job right out of graduation and have been living car-free the entire time so it\u2019s more than doable.",

If you do choose to go to school in Halifax, expect to hire tutors for all of your classes and take remedial classes for every subject you're studying.  Also, school is more expensive in Nova Scotia because we have to pay the \"out of province\" rate, making the tuition a few thousand dollars more expensive.\n\nLiving car free is doable but it is miserable.  You can shop on Spring Garden Road, Barrington Street, and the Mumford Mall.  The rest of the city is difficult to access by transit, and the hills make cycling difficult.\n\nI'm at SMU, and I'm trying to get back to Ontario for the lower tuition that we have here.",

There is the infamous panda game and UO vs Carleton rivalry that raise the spirits of many students. Also many first year students enjoy the convenience of going to Gatineau to club and bar hop. Yes you can live car free fine here, there is a metro line that is very convenient. Just make sure where you live off residence is close to a metro station because the busses are very inconsistent here. I think your program can benefit in being in Ottawa because there are a lot of opportunities for you in the government.",

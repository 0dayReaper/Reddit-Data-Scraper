My advice to avoid that is to start studying one full week before any midterm so you have lots of time for other assignments, labs, etc. Because of the workload once it gets to 4 or 5 days before the test you might have very little study time left. With engg if you really want it then you can do it. Best of luck!",

Take things seriously and make sure to apply yourself (sounds like a no Brainer, but I didn't and failed linear algebra at STFX the first time around).\n\n2nd year is better because you have course that apply what you've learned so it become a lot more interest and less abstract theory (think of making practical use of calculus instead of the bland math theory behind it)",

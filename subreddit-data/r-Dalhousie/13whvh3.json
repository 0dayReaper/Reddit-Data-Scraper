Regular CS as regular cs almost the same as it is at other Canadian universities content wise.\n\nAre you bad with math or it\u2019s not your strong suit but you can do business writing kind of? Then ACS \n\nThat\u2019s really the short version. \n\nIn terms of jobs they\u2019re usually all the same but also it depends how you do in the interviews albeit technical or not.\n\nThere\u2019s none that\u2019s better for introverted people in my personal opinion because when you start working full time within the industry that introverted ness kinda has to go out the door when you do stand ups and meetings explaining and getting along and of course team bonding retreats and/or exercises.",

Whether you decide to do BCS or BACS you will have to do at least a little bit of project management and get out of your comfort zone a bit.\n\nSocial skills is something that can be learned. Don't let it sway your decision either way.",

Fyi, you will learn more stuffs regarding web based languages, not network stuffs as network communication and network security courses also require math knowledge and undergraduate certificate for network commnucation and cyber security exists for bcs student as two mandatory courses network engineering course and operating system course are core courses for cs students, which are pretty  hard for assignments that require deep math knowledge and skills to convert them to codes while bacs focuses on management and web server languages, which are much easier.",

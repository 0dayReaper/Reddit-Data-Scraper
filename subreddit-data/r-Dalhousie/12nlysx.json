In high school I played on a lot of sports teams, volunteered, had good grades (honours with distinction so 90+), and did not grow up with a lot of money. I have heard they award students who are well rounded and have succeeded in different areas. When I applied, financial need was considered (and maybe still is) so my last point likely influenced what I earned too.",

I\u2019ve never done that much all at once but it shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Tell them it\u2019s going towards living costs if asked.",

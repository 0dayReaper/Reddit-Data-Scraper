It\u2019s a time consuming course but the content that you\u2019ll learn will seriously help you with citations and paper writing in higher level courses. \n\nFor electives, I would stick with something fun and easy. First year core courses can be a lot, so give yourself something that takes a bit of the load off: Human Sexuality, Intro to Guitar, Photojournalism, etc.",

Every week someone in the department came in to talk to us about their research work, the prof was very chill, TA gave good feedback. Well worth it, especially if you\u2019re going into marine biology or oceanography",

If it\u2019s a matter of putting in the effort I\u2019m willing to do it, but people have mentioned subjective marking and it discourages me a lot.",

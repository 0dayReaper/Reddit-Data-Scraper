It does not like taking on any sort of legal liability. \n\nThis aside, tattoos are a high risk activity. People can contract disease and you can seriously mess someone up. A signed waiver only goes so far. You should carefully consider what you would do if something went wrong; in most cases it would open you up to being sued for non-trivial damages.",

You would also NOT be insured to Tattoo in a dorm room, as it would absolutely contravene this act. This insurance would not only include tattooing people... but if any injury came your way. We aren't even getting into any potential lawsuit issues from students with regrets or a roommate who doesn't appreciate what you're \n\nYou would also face significant restrictions on your operations within (even on \"fake skin\"/pig skin) under the rental agreement you undertake in your dorm room. Dorm Rooms are under significantly different rules. I would be very hesitant to try any commercial activity, even if it's \"training on 'fake skin'\", as the school likely bans that type of activity under the agreement you sign to move in. \n\nThe best solution for yourself is to ask to work/apprentice part-time under a Halifax Tattoo artist. There are a TON of artists in the city. They would be able to take you under their wing and lead you through the process to make sure and if you have your own equipment and are practicing in a way which limits your liability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR do not tattoo in Rez, if you actually care about legal risks of the practice, and potentially being kicked out of rez. Find a tattoo shop that'll take you in, if it's actually a passion.",

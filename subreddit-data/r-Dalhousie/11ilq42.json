They are 30 years behind Ontario, B.C, Alberta, etc - assessments done by Dalhousie staff/graduates often have to be redone as they are not considered valid by psychiatrists here or by most people outside the province.   'Professional recommendations' contains googled advice that often harm autistic people (i.e. 'SMART goals' for adults in a professional career) and most 'clinicians' are neurotypical people who try to cover their  intrinsic belief that ASD = intellectually disabled and that ASD people will never live full lives with virtue signaling and eutherisms like  '(dis) Abilities'.\n\nOh and you'll be blocked from accessing your own medical file/notes which makes it difficult to get competent, out of the province help.",

She posts regularly about her advocacy within and beyond the Dalhousie community on Instagram: @ dsu_disabledstudentsrep Meredith can be reached by email at dsustdis@dal.ca\n\nOn an advocacy-related note, would you be interested in joining an informal students with disability caucus to help inform some short to medium term advocacy objectives? These include a potential townhall, survey, and a critical review of the University Strategic Plan for accessibility. You can email me or nominate someone you know at dsupres@dal.ca",

For example some are social, some are anti-social. Hence, why \"the spectrum\". And yes some may not be comfortable being part of a larger DSU society and would rather prefer to hangout in a small group. \n\nI have also experienced difficulty interacting with autistic folks as we all have a varied sense of the Theory of Mind. We often ran into difficulty understanding each other's intentions, which exposed us to a higher risk of misunderstanding and conflicts.\n\nKnowing if someone is Autistic is also a protected health information so I must excercise privacy and trust when looking for \"like-minded\" people. \n\nSomething that I am sure you also know..it is often found that when someone is Autistic, they also have other co-morbid conditions like ADHD, Social Anxiety, Mood Disorders, Eating Disorders, Dyslexia etc. Hence why I  chose the term \"Neurodivergence@Dal\" so that autistic people who have other different conditions -- don't feel left out of the group.",

    "postText": "I am switching to BACS from BCS from my second year but will not be able to take MGMT 1302 in the winter term because it has a time conflict with my co-op required course. Is it still possible for me to take 1302 in the winter term of my second year or should I postpone it to my third year winter term?",

This would be a really good time to book an appointment with an advisor to work through how you can fulfil all requirements for your new degree as well as do coop.",

    "postText": "To the Dalhousie reddit community,\n\nI've followed all the discourse on this subreddit since the petition was posted 2 weeks ago. I want to make it clear that this account is my only Reddit account and this is the first time I am posting on here. Since this has been the most conducive platform for discussion, I wanted to post my statement regarding everything that has been leveled against me. I've been very busy but if you have questions please comment below and be respectful. I want to be as transparent as possible but I don't want to deal with any more hateful messages. \n\nThank you.\n\n \n\n**CW: the following contains discussions of sexual violence** \n\nTo the members of the Dalhousie Student Union and the larger community,\n\nI have decided to write this open letter to show that all the accusations and claims made against me are untrue. I am being as transparent as possible and in this letter, I will demonstrate the basis of this claim. I have not released this information yet as I have been waiting for the investigation to be initiated, however, as no one has substantiated these claims, due process has not been able to occur. I expected that, with the fact that no investigation was able to take place, I would be presumed innocent. Instead, my silence has allowed the court of public opinion to find me guilty. I am now facing harsh consequences in my work and personal life for a crime I did not commit despite no investigation taking place.\n\nI knew the moment that I read the petition and the comments below, that there was malicious intent behind it. Immediately following the petition being posted online, an unknown number of Dalhousie students and alumni found that their Dal emails were used for signatures and sometimes comments on the petition without their knowledge or consent. Furthermore, falsified text screenshots were posted on Reddit.com by a user claiming to be the author of the petition in an attempt to prove misconduct on my part during the campaign period. It became clear that this petition was more of a political smear campaign than anything else.\n\nAfter further investigation by numerous parties, it is abundantly clear that the individual who made these accusations does not exist. ***This*** **Olivia Macdonald does not exist.** The author of this petition has made up a story with a fake identity with the sole purpose of sabotaging my reputation and delegitimizing my election as Vice President Student Life of the Dalhousie Student Union. There is no trace of this individual in Dalhousie\u2019s student directories and no trace of them online. Furthermore, the comments that have corroborated this story with similar experiences have been created by the author of the petition. Fairs Raed, Sarah Brown, Emily G, and Felicity Arsenal are also among other false identities created to aid in a campaign of lies and hate. Many have attempted to find these individuals to no avail. These comments were quickly disproven. For example, there was no Felicity Arsenal in the production of the musical and no \u2018school party\u2019 took place for what was written to occur.\n\nNonetheless, I have sought any applicable authority to investigate these allegations because they are criminal allegations and I do not take criminal allegations lightly. After the HRES refused to take on the investigation since no one had stepped forward, an investigation with the HRP was initiated. The DSU are not participating in the investigation because they have decided to obey the wishes of a phantom masquerading as a survivor. Instead, the DSU should be aiding investigative procedures that have been created to deal with these cases. I have personally contacted the officer in charge of the case, Constable Oliver Boettcher, and have given him all the information I have accumulated for the investigation. This included the over 80 witnesses who were present the night of the incident as well as a comprehensive timeline of the night with photos and videos to prove that what I have been accused of is absolutely impossible. \n\nMuch of the incurring conversation has revolved around the proper method of treating a survivor and I want to make it abundantly clear that in this situation, there is no survivor. I am *not* the perpetrator of sexual assault; I am the victim of harassment, and slander. If there was actually someone behind this petition then I would not be speaking like this and I would have done everything I can to mitigate the situation. But considering that so many people have decided to perpetuate the lies of a ghost, I have no choice but to adamantly defend my reputation. \n\nIt has been two weeks since the Change.org petition calling for my removal from the DSU has been made. **It has been the hardest two weeks of my life**. I have received hate messages as well as death threats. It has caused severe mental anguish. I have been suspended from the job I worked so hard to get; **a job that I ran for because I am passionate about giving back to the community.** This online post has spread all over the world and has caused so much pain for the people that I love. My friends and family have been harassed and attacked for supporting me to any degree. Friends who have questioned the petition have been socially ostracized by their peer groups. My family members and my girlfriend are emotionally distraught and are hurt by all the messages of hate being posted online.\n\nThe image that has been made of me is completely inaccurate. I have been painted as a horrible heartless monster and it couldn't be further from the truth. I am a Lebanese son of a pastor and an educator and I have always been a friend to those around me. I never discriminate and I would never intentionally harm those around me. I\u2019ve heard people say that maybe it was all a facade, that everything about me was an act. Is it really that much easier to believe that I lived my life for the past 21 years lying to every single person I have met? **I am not the person this petition makes me out to be and I am devastated and disheartened that anyone that knows me could believe that I would commit such atrocities.**\n\nTo move forward there needs to be transparency and active participation from both the HRES and the DSU to ensure this investigation proceeds fairly and thoroughly. I implore the HRES to release a statement explaining why they have been unable to conduct the investigation and the DSU to participate in the Halifax Regional Police\u2019s investigation. By their lack of action, they are willfully contributing to the destruction of my reputation and my future for the sake of public image. Furthermore, once the perpetrator of these false allegations is found, I will seek reparations for the damage that these defamatory and slanderous claims have caused. \n\nTo those who have reached out to offer support and defended my character, I want to say thank you. Without the calls and texts I received, it would have been much harder to fight this injustice. To those still on the fence about what to believe, I encourage you to look deeper at what is being said and question the narrative. Until this is over, I hope that this investigation proceeds unhindered by all the parties involved and that all the harm caused will be resolved. \n\nThank you, \n\nJad Ghiz\n\nIf you need support, please reach out to the organizations listed below.\n\n**Survivor Support Centre** \n\nEmail: [survivorsupport@dal.ca](mailto:survivorsupport@dal.ca) \n\nPhone: (902) 425-1066 \n\n**South House Halifax** \n\nEmail: [outreach@southhousehalifax.ca](mailto:outreach@southhousehalifax.ca) \n\nPhone: (902) 494-2432 \n\n**Dalhousie Human Rights and Equity Services (HRES)** \n\nEmail: [hres@dal.ca](mailto:hres@dal.ca) \n\nPhone: (902) 494-6672 \n\n**Dal Student Health &amp; Wellness** \n\nWebsite: dal.ca/campus\\_life/health-and-wellness \n\nPhone: (902) 494-2171 \n\n**Halifax Regional Police**\n\nEmail: [contacthrp@halifax.ca](mailto:contacthrp@halifax.ca) \n\nPhone: (902) 490-5016",

Do I've answered to those tweets personally on my twitter accounts. None of these rumours have any basis because they are just rumours. And last I checked rumours are not evidence. \n\nFinally, I am getting tired of replying to throwaway accounts. If you have any more questions I ask you use a real account.

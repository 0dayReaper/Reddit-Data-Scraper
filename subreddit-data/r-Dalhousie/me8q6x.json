    "postText": "So I was talking to my friend and she is doing CS at Dalhousie. She\u2019s a Muslim. She is terrified to interact with her classmates because of her religion. Why would someone have to hide the fact that she is Muslim? She doesn\u2019t tell / indicate her religion at all infront of them.\n\nContext: her groupmates for some of the courses use curse words and slangs after a Muslim professor\u2019s name. The professor\u2019s name is of significant importance in Islam. Don\u2019t pick on it specifically because of his name.\n\nHonestly we see all the hate crime regarding Muslim people around the world. Uyghurs Muslims in China, Muslims in India and many more.\n\nThis is just sick. If don\u2019t have anything good to say then don\u2019t say. Don\u2019t use swear words for another person\u2019s religion or name.",

If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned in my time in Qatar it\u2019s that the stigma in the western world around Islam is misplaced and can largely be summed up to ignorance. \n\nAs a non muslim I find that the culture and religion is beautiful. The people are friendly and charming. I even find myself using Arabic phrases in my day to day conversations. Inshallah people will see this is the truth. The sooner the better.",

You get my idea, it was simply just a theory of sort, you didnt need to be so passive aggressive in your reddit reply. Simply its just a recommendation, also even when there are classmates that respect you, you can lose grip on the faith, when there is no one (excluding parents) around you practicing it in daily life.",

I hope you get why she is scared to disclose that she is a Muslim and not because she just wants to \u201cblend in\u201d",

I am a Muslim brown girl, I really hope Dalhousie University is diverse and there are many people from different ethnicities there. Can someone please provide some more insight into the demographics at Dal? Are there a lot of Muslims? Is it easy to make friends? What do you recommend for adapting better? I\u2019ll be moving out of Calgary so I\u2019m new to Halifax as well.",

    "postText": "I was wondering if anyone else was stressing about this class, or if anyone has had STATS1060 with her before over the summer. The syllabus says students must receive a 50% on the final exam to pass the class. When I did STATS1060 w/ Sarhan in Fall '23 (failed by 2% which is why I'm retaking) that regulation was not in place. I know the exam class average in fall '23 with sarhan was 38%. I'm so fucking stressed about this class because if I fail it again, I'll get kicked out of my program. I emailed her to express my concern and ask her what the class average was on the last stats1060 final exam that she taught and she replied back with a very hostile message saying none of it mattered, and that she wasn't going to bother to check for me, and that I just need to keep up with the class. I'm literally shitting bricks. I cannot fail this final exam. I need to know if anyone has experiences with her teaching this class before. Ratemyprof is not helping.",

So I feel you.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would hire a tutor day 1. \nI would attend every class and ask for practice questions.\nI would go through all my notes (you've taken this class before so you'll have a 1-up)\nAlso, if I feel like I'm getting lost in a class, I spend a lot of time on Khan Academy, just making sure I have a grasp on the foundation.",

You may have a different experience in lecture, but they are almost certainly using a bank of test questions that has been around for a decade or longer, the questions on the test will likely be extremely similar to last time you took it. Just show up to your lectures, pay attention, get help/tutoring if you need it, and you should be fine.",

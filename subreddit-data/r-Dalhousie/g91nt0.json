    "postText": "I understand you could argue that we still had the same amount of course work and communications with our profs, but we lost access to the library, Dalplex, computer labs, wifi, etc. not to mention supports like learning centers where you could meet with TAs. Everything you pay for to connect and learn in a physical environment instead of online university.\n\nIt was a huge blow to what people are able to get out of their time at Dal. I understand it was out of their control and everybody did the best they could with the situation. But we still lost opportunity for knowledge and \"the college experience\" that nobody is going to get back, and if you think about it, they saved money not having to run campus. So I feel a small reimbursement isn't really that wild a proposition",

The online experience hasn't compared at all to routine, probably because professors were caught off-guard, scrambled to develop online infrastructure to distribute course material. It's totally understandable.\n\nBut I've had courses cut short, find it harder to communicate with professors, don't really get feedback on grades anymore, so it's difficult to reconcile paying so much when you're getting the short end of the learning stick. I get why, and I appreciate the profs who are trying their best in a difficult circumstance, but it still feels bad.",

One of my profs didnt post any lectures but compromised by making the final exam shorter and open book. Everyone I know did terribly on it. If this is what my school year will look like come next fall, I might even reconsider going to Dal.",

I've had profs who've totally butchered the online experience by cancelling lectures, assignments, etc, so we've missed out on a significant part of  the course.

I'm willing to accept that the transition has been very difficult for everyone, but the quality of some classes has degraded past the point of acceptability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCombining this issue with the lack of access to resources (which, I think, is the greater issue), I think we should be receiving some reimbursement.",

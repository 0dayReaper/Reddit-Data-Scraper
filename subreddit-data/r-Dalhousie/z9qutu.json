They will empty your bank account, they will ruin your life.\n\nThe pay seems great.  That's a marker of a scam.\nThe message comes out of the blue.  That's a marker of a scam.\nThe message comes from a Dal account, but the form isn't hosted on a Dal domain.  That's a marker of a scam.",

It was a link to a google doc that was titled \u201cYour Assessment Here\u201d and the document contained a link to a suspicious looking website (I didn\u2019t click it, just hovered over the hyperlink to see the domain). \n\nI\u2019ve also gotten phishing emails from someone claiming to be the dean of engineering, but it was just a random gmail account lol. Pls be careful \ud83e\udd72\n\nedit: grammar",

I took 1215. we had assignments, projects, and could bring a cheat sheet to the test which math1000 wasn\u2019t allowed to have. look at what you\u2019re planning to major in and decide on that because some degrees need math 1000 as a prerequisite for another math course",

That being said, if you have dr noble as your math 1000 prof, he literally gives you a bank of questions from which he pulls for exam questions, which made the course pretty easy if you understand the concepts",

However as the other comments said, noble is an awesome prof who offers all the material for a great mark if you\u2019re up to a bit more of a challenge. As for 1060, I took both at the same time and wasn\u2019t very overwhelmed, Saharan is a good prof who gives great exam review, so don\u2019t stress!!!",

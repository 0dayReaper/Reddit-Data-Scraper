    "postText": "Hey folks, I got an email from residence saying that only a few floors in residence are substance free, and I don't think I can afford these floors. Is substance abuse a problem in any of the residences? Particularly Howe hall. I don't really care about alcohol, but I cannot stand the smell of weed or tobacco.",

Substance free floors most likely won\u2019t be completely \u201csubstance free\u201d. every residence will smell like weed or tobacco from time and time again. just something you sort of have to live with depending who gets put in your hall. My hall in risley sometimes smelt like weed but there was a hall downstairs that ALWAYS reeked. Kinda just the cards you get dealt with who\u2019s around you",

Never had a problem with smelling tabacco, but the place constantly smelled like weed. I\u2019m sure everyone in my hall smoked in their rooms. Not a problem for me, but there was definitely a smell lol.",

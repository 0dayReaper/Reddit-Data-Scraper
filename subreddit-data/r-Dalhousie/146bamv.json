I have a few questions for those of you who commute by car: how complicated is it to park around campus? How often do you get stuck in traffic going to and from campus? How expensive is it to have a car in Halifax? Thanks!",

            "comment": "I find driving to campus one of the most stressful parts of my day to be honest. First, you should avoid it if possible. Unfortunately Halifax is a car city not a very good public transportation city. The routes toward Dalhousie get pinched into just a few streets no matter which direction you\u2019re coming from. There are so many schools and hospitals in Dalhousie\u2019s area that it is a huge destination for commuter traffic. The only way to get around it is to go in super early, which coincidentally makes parking easier, and leave super early. Anywhere near Dal is hellish gridlock after ~8:20 (aim to get there by 7:45 for best results). If you can\u2019t leave Dal by exactly 3PM you might as well stay at Dal and read papers until 6PM otherwise you\u2019ll add at least 20 - 30 minutes just trying to get out of the Dal area and on to whatever your commute \u201ctrunk\u201d is.",

Traffic can get pretty bad during rush hour but otherwise it's fine. But if you live close to campus I wouldnt even bother driving. Downtown Halifax is pretty walkable so you wouldnt even need to drive.",

If you have class starting between 8-10 the drive sucks but parking on the road at campus is easy. If you have a class starting after that the drive isn\u2019t bad but parking sucks. Only time it doesn\u2019t suck is around 1:30 - 3:00 start, parking and driving is good at that time.",

Typically a lot of students apply to several health science programs and get accepted into more than one and when they choose which program they want to pursue then more spots open up! Half of my current class didn't get an offer during the first round of offers that were sent out. It may be a while until you hear back again but don't hesitate to reach out to the school for an update if you don't hear back after a few more weeks!",

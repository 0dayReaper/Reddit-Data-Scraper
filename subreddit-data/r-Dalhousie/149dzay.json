    "postText": "CALLING ALL ADVANCED STANDING NURSING STUDENTS!!\n\nIm not sure if im fulfilling the right course requirements. I am going into my first year as a bachelor of science student who is hoping to go into the advanced standing nursing program. I was told that in order to be eligible for the first round of admissions I needed to have less than 2 pre-reqs in winter semester, hence why my fall semester looks heavy. \n\nI still need to choose one more elective, however I am having a hard time choosing. If anyone has recommendations, it would be very much appreciated : )\n\nHere is my schedule: \n\nFall semester: ANAT 1010,  MICI 1100, PHYL 1001, STAT 1060, BIOL 1010\n\nWinter semester: HPRO 4412, ENGL 1100, SOSA 1002, BIOL 1011",

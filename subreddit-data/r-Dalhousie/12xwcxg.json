    "postText": "This semester I have really been struggling with my mental health, combined with personal family issues. Due to this I may fail one of my courses, and with an exam looming, I am feeling very overwhelmed. \n\nI got in contact with the assistant dean of computer science to see if I could do anything, preferably drop the course and get a refund so that it would allow me to take it during another term, even though I know it's late in the semester. I\u2019ve just gotten a final response back from the assistant Dean and it looks like they are not helping much.\n\nI am unable to get a refund or drop the course due to being active in the course (barley) past the the drop date . I can\u2019t get an ILL grade without providing a: \u201csignificant medical documentation from a doctor stating the student has been receiving treatment throughout the term and was not able to complete coursework\u201d.\n\nThe assistant dean said that my only option is to take the exam and hope to pass. It sucks that they don\u2019t really care to help much or give any advising for my situation. \n\nDo you guys have any advice and suggestions?",

School is some hard stuff and you gotta be attentive at all times. \n\nIf you\u2019re struggling in the first week of classes, you gotta reach out for help and take suggestions because this always happen when you let things slide and then accumulate over time. It\u2019s much better to drop the class for your mental health during the allotted time than try and convince yourself to get through something you can\u2019t. \n\nIf you\u2019re going through mental health issues, you gotta deal with that first otherwise you will continue to make the wrong choices and your judgment will be clouded. \n\nLearn from this and take some time off or ensure to get supports in place ASAP. You\u2019ll be okay eventually \u2764\ufe0f",

I think that wanting a refund at this point is quite unreasonable. All you can do is your best on the exam or accept a failing grade on your transcript. I\u2019m sure falling one class won\u2019t be that big of a deal.",

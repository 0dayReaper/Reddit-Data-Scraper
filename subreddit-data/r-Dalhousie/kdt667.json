    "postText": "If anyone else (like me) is annoyed and disappointed in Dal's decision to not extend the winter break (as almost every other university in Canada has) please send an email voicing your concerns! The mental health crisis going on with online school is crazy at Dal and this shows how little the executives actually care about students. I received an email from one of my profs urging us to do so if we feel this way--he recommended emailing the DSU, provost, and chair of the senate. I will provide their emails below. If anyone needs help writing an email feel free to shoot me a message. They gotta know we expect them to do better.\n\nprovost@dal.ca (provost)\nkevin.hewitt@dal.ca (chair of senate)\ndsucomm@dal.ca (dalhousie student union)\n\nUpdate: received this response from the DSU. They seem genuine, and I believe that they tried on this one. Still important they know of the student concerns but IMO concerns should be directed more toward the provost and senate. [DSU email](https://imgur.com/80Wdx82) \n\nNote: U of T, Laurier, Concordia and Waterloo are a few of the universities who have extended their break. \n\nNote 2: Many professors are being encouraged to practice a \"slow start\" meaning you may have gotten emails from profs that their course will begin a week or so later into January. This is not an extension of the winter break. Faculty do not get any relief in this scenario, and students are still expected to be engaging with material in brightspace and/or doing readings and preliminary work.",

I also deal with complex mental illness and found supports lacking more than usual this semester. Not sure why they gave us more lecture material (based on recordings and time they said getting through class material should take) than usual, no lab access, and charged us more. Kind of annoyed they aren't sending the SRIs to the higher ups as some of my profs were horrible, but one was amazing and very compassionate. I think the latter, at least, needs to be passed along. I wish I could give that prof a hug and a batch of cookies.",

Add in severe burnout, mental breakdowns, mental illness, financial stress, reflecting on the past year, many people not being able to see loved ones, etc, and good god it can be ROUGH.\n\nEdited to add I feel horrible for students who will be in quarantine over Xmas and/or new years. If for no other reason, it would have been good to extend it for their sake as dal was pushing for students to move back for last semester and I'm guessing they're doing it for next semester.",

    "postText": "For anyone unaware of the current complications with the Dalhousie Student Union (DSU) Presidential Elections, one candidate, Adam Lucas, has been disqualified from the running and fined $220 by the DSU. Adam Lucas was running on the basis of a satirical platform to present his argument that the DSU does very little in comparison to how high of a pedestal them put themselves on. Upon attending the Presidential Debate, he was shouted at to leave by the moderator within 15 minutes of the actual debate. Adam had been given many guidelines and rules prior to the debate that he alone had to follow to avoid disqualification. Even abiding by these rules Adam left the debate quietly and peacefully only to receive a poorly supported disqualification letter the next day. Not only was he disqualified but under many baseless accusations and abused penalty guidelines, Adam is now being fined $220 by the very Student Union that exists to defend him and other students. He is currently appealing the accusations of Chief Returning Officer (CRO), Nathan Little, who was also the moderator of the debate. Some of the main accusations are listed below:\n\n**-Nathan Little claims he has received complaints about Adam Lucas resulting in a fraudulent fine of $20.**\n\n**-Nathan Little claims his conduct was disruptive during the debate.**\n\n**-Nathan Little claims he received a lengthy complaint at 11:35PM which thus means that the debate \"deeply troubled a student and impacted their ability to sleep\" (This sounds made up, I know).**\n\n**-Nathan Little claims that a group of \"associates\" (Little fails to derive a difference between supporters and associates) asked \"Where the camera was,\" thus meaning that they planned to interfere with the debate live stream.**\n\n**-Nathan Little claims that since the \"associates\" (supporters) dressed in the same attire, this meant they planned and coordinated to disrupt the debate and was directly affiliated with the campaign resulting in a fine of $50 under the Elections Policy subparagraph 6(b)(i)(5) which details that the CRO (Nathan Little) may levy fines of $50 for any reason he sees fit, without any deliberation from others.**\n\n**-Nathan Little claims that two \"associates\" harassed an Election Committee member by hovering his mouse over the members name in a Google Doc of questions to be asked in the debate, later checking on the member to make sure his question would be asked. The question being the candidates opinions on Adam Lucas being removed from the debate resulting in another abused $50 fine from Elections Policy subparagraph 6(b)(i)(5).**\n\n**-Nathan Little claims that he was harassed and antagonized by two \"associates\" after the debate leading to Little shouting at the two in front of many students (Little's reaction, according to the most recently updated DSU Election Rules, is considered in itself to be harassment) resulting in another $50 fine from Elections Policy subparagraph 6(b)(i)(5).**\n\n**-Nathan Little claims that Adam Lucas has had a hostile presence in the campaign being \"unreasonably argumentative\" to the CRO.**\n\n**-Nathan Little claims that Adam Lucas did not leave immediately after the CRO demanded him to, saying that he was asking \"pointless clarifying questions\" as in the question being \"Am I being kicked out?\"**\n\n**-Nathan Little claims that after being shouted at to leave the debate, Adam Lucas \"triumphantly\" raised his hands as he left the debate while the live stream was watched by over 1000 people resulting in another $50 fine from Elections Policy subparagraph 6(b)(i)(5).**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdam Lucas is currently appealing these claims and fines as the Dalhousie Student Union is trying to silence the views of one of its own students by charging Lucas with more than $100 in fines, automatically disqualifying him from the election according to the Election Policy subparagraph 6(c)(i)(4). Universities are supposed to be opportunities of intelligent discussion and challenging of free thought. The DSU is directly impeding this basic idea of higher learning by trying to threaten the very students it represents with monetary loss. Nathan Little's Notice of Disqualification also refers to Adam Lucas as instead \"Alex Lucas\" meaning in all technicalities, none of these should apply to him as he was not properly notified of these charges. Please, to preserve free thought, speech and the right of open conversation, bring your concerns and issues to the CRO at [dsucro@dal.ca](mailto:dsucro@dal.ca), thank you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Sources Used\n\nDSU General Elections 2019 Web Page: [http://dsu.ca/elections](http://dsu.ca/elections)\n\nElections Policy: [http://dsu.ca/sites/default/files/image-uploads/Elections%20Policy%20-%20Council%20adopted%20Oct%202018.pdf](http://dsu.ca/sites/default/files/image-uploads/Elections%20Policy%20-%20Council%20adopted%20Oct%202018.pdf)\n\nNotice of Disqualification (In Bio of Adam Lucas): [https://www.instagram.com/adam\\_lucas\\_for\\_dsu\\_president/](https://www.instagram.com/adam_lucas_for_dsu_president/)\n\nCampaign Information and Rules: [http://dsu.ca/elections/campaignrules](http://dsu.ca/elections/campaignrules)\n\nLive Stream Debate:  [https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story\\_fbid=387405611812975&amp;id=40582581617&amp;refsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2Fdalstudentunion%2Fvideos%2F387405611812975&amp;\\_rdr](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=387405611812975&amp;id=40582581617&amp;refsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2Fdalstudentunion%2Fvideos%2F387405611812975&amp;_rdr)",

Also as according to Nathan Little, anyone who is supporting a candidate makes them an \u201cassociate\u201d and thus the candidate is responsible for their actions even though this is not written anywhere. By that logic if you throw on a mask and a supportive shirt for a candidate and wreck havoc on the Dalhousie campus you could disqualify someone in a matter of seconds.",

When I talked with Adam after his debate he told me how he focused on being apolitical for his posters and platform, just so something like this could be prevented. It\u2019s a very corrupt system, and there\u2019s no detailing what happens if Lucas refuses to pay the fines.",

Is such a thing possible?",

Significant barriers means that by changing the environment to be a smaller room or private room that you\u2019ll still be faced with barriers which cannot be accommodated (this would also require extensive medical documentation to show that you are significantly affected and will not be able to perform. Exam anxiety would not fall under this category \u2014 most disabilities don\u2019t). A more typical accommodation is writing online exams in person in the testing hall, the flip to be online changes the format (which isn\u2019t typically allowed), along with introducing new opportunities that wouldn\u2019t be given to all other students.",

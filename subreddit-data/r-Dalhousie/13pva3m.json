I have also received some scholarship from Dal.\n\nOf course, UBC is going to be very expensive for me, but I am applying for loans and scholarships too. Is it going to be worth going to UBC (i plan on doing statistics)...  I also want to hear from dal students, what has your experience been like at dal? \n\ni want to know mainly about the programs and if there are any benefits in moving away...",

That's what Dalhousie has told me multiple times.  What did the lawyers from B.C. disability alliance who specializes in this sort of thing say?",

Every year I've been at dal they've been horrible when it comes to respecting accommodations, addressing ableism, or even just being able to get ahold of my accommodations advisor within 3 weeks after being prom8sed weekly meetings. I thought it would get better at rhe graduate level, but it's worse because now I can't go to the assistant dean of science when the accommodations department is refusing to do their job. Profs at dal do not have to give a reason to not respect your accommodations, they usually do at other institutions. Accommodations will not step in if a prof says they don't want you using your accommodations even if it in no way impacts meeting outcomes for the course. I've been told me having accommodations isn't fair to other students (eg sorry you're chronic pain is flared up to the point of you vomiting but giving you a 48h extension means it's nto fair to students who don't have chronic pain and don't get extensipns).\n\nFor anyone who's neurodivergent and looking at dal... reach out to autism ns. I at least have an advocate now to reiterate what i say because apparently I don't understand or speak basic English but when someone says verbatim what I just did (when they aren't autistic), it makes perfect sense.\n\nDal has a real ableism problem. Autism ns backs that up and any trauma therapist I've seen has stated dal is notoriously bad for supporting students with mental illness and other disabilities. Dals research centee for autism literally has links to autism speaks and autism speaks Canada. Dal is not accessible and puts money into claiming how they aren't ableiat while doing nothing to actually change it. If you try to report ableism you're told you misunderstood and it wasn't ableism because... well, you just have to understand thst sort of thing doesn't happen at dal.\n\nDoesn't matter how high your grades are eor if you're out of undergrad, dal is NOT the place if you're a survivor, autistic, or have a physical disability. I've seen first hand how the sexism becomes very apparent when students with disabilities are involved. If I could get my masters elsewhere on the Atlantic provinces, I would.",

I've been told to 'drop out', refused most disability accomodations and blamed.  And have had to have autism NS step in for over a year (which SAC still ignores).  Ironically even Autism Speaks is concerned about how Dalhousie treats disabled students.  There's no legal advocacy in NS focusing on disabilities rights so Dalhousie knows nobody will hold them responsible.  I know multiple people who have had to file human rights complaints\n\nB.C. universities can be shitty but they will smarten up if you go to the free legal clinic at B.C. disability alliance where some lawyers actually specialize in writing accommodation letters to universities.  And it's easier to sue universities that violate accessibility rights",

I could write a novel on all the things Ive witnessed or had happen to me at dal. They make you feel/tell you directly that you're the only person ever who's \"complained\" about certain issues or faced them, and that maybe you're the problem. Disabled individuals are FAR less likely to go to the media with issues than other students, and it feels like dal really capitalizes on this.",

I reached out to them out of desperation.  They became extremely concerned about SAC's lack of accommodations and a lot of Dalhousie ASD specialist's lack of and outdated knowledge.  They also were concerned about Dalhousie's ableism.  \n\nThat says a lot about Dalhousie's 'anti oppressive' framework.",

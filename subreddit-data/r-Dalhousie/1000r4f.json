    "postText": "Throwaway to stay anonymous.  \n\n\nI've been a TA for a 2nd year course for 5 semesters now, during my time we've always had 5-6 TA's and 8 markers. For the upcoming semester the prof was informed that our TA hours have been cut in half and the number of TAs and markers have been cut to 3 &amp; 4 Respectively, which makes no sense as we've always fallen behind and could barely keep up with 120+ students, weekly labs and assignments, and I've informed the new professor about how crazy this is but its out of their control.  \n\n\nThis is complete BS as my workloads effectively more than doubled and I know that I wont be able to provide adequate support in any way. Is this Dal's way to retaliate against the new increased wages, if so isn't this illegal?",

If you're asked to go beyond them, contact CUPE 3912 and file a grievance.  \n\n\nIt's essential that the hours are counted. CUPE 3912 cannot defend you if there's no evidence.",

I did the math on it and it works out to less pay, even with the new pay rate.\n\nEdit: complain to the union. This is the exact kind of fuel they need for the next collective agreement bargaining.",

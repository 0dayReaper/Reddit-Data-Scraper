    "postText": "How are ARCH 1001 and 1002 as electives for non-architecture majors? I\u2019m enrolled at kings for FYP but Im interested in architecture and design and have thought about taking these as my electives as long as they\u2019re not super writing heavy. Good choice or no? Any similar alternatives?",

            "comment": "I took both last year, they are very light in terms of work but the few assignments you ARE assigned tend to take a lot of work to complete and are worth a very large portion of your grade (ex. Last year in ARCH 1001 there were only 2 assignments worth 45% and 55% of your grade). I completely recommend you take these courses as electives, as long as you put time and effort into the projects it\u2019s an easy A",

I did most ARCH projects in a day or two; I pretty much just grinded out projects in 5-10 hours so I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about them for the rest of the week.",

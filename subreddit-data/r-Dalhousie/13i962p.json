Is it over for me?\n\nI\u2019ve have the worst semester so far last winter term due to personal and family issues, my mental health hasn\u2019t been so great. I wanted to take this Summer to recover and come back this fall stronger. \n\nI guess the reason for this post is what options do I have right now? I\u2019m so scared because I\u2019ve been in the computer science program for around 3. I would appreciate all the help I can get.",

From there ask the councillor to write a letter to the Dean of CS supporting an ILL grade for all courses this term or year. they can\u2019t give detail but will provide information clearly stating you have been visiting  them. - i saw in your last post the AD said you need significant notice from a doctor but this should suffice if you write your own personal letter to accompany it explaining the stress and struggle you\u2019ve been going through, explain how courses have added to this stress etc\u2026 This should suffice for medical documentation, no promises though it worked for me about 5 years ago, process might have changed. Feel free to pm me if you have anymore questions, goodluck! you\u2019ll get through it",

I\u2019m a Dal alum, graduated in 2019.\n\nOver the course of my time at Dal, I had to have many awkward exchanges with professors\u2026 Sometimes talking with student affairs etc. to get extensions on certain projects or even certain grades excused.\n\n It is awkward, talking to professors/university officials about personal matters\u2026 I\u2019ll spare you the details, but I had some seriously terrible things happened to me at Dal and I had to open up about then to a number of people in order to get academic accommodations. I even ended up getting an incomplete (INC) in at least one class. Not great, but it\u2019s better than outright failing.\n\nHang in there, with the issues I was dealing with, South House was a great source of advocacy. Otherwise talk to your professors. See if there\u2019s someone in your program who could support you.\n\nGood luck.",

If you take the course and pass, you can reapply in the fall without having to wait the 8 months.  The course basically goes over stuff like studying habits, exam prep, academic writing, academic dishonesty, etc etc.  It\u2019s pretty easy overall.  \n\nRegardless of whether you take the course or not, when you do return you will still be on academic probation, so you\u2019ll have to get good grades to pull yourself out of it.\n\nGood luck!",

Prior meetings were fairly quick, vague and unguided. This is my personal experience and maybe  other people will have different experiences. \n\nWhen I realized I was suffering from mental health issues halfway through my undergrad, the only way I could receive any sort of help was, step one, by seeing a psychologist for an assessment. You can do so privately (Dal insurance should cover this 100% up to 1k) or you can make an appointment to see a doctor from the Dal Student Health and Wellness Centre/see your family doctor if you have one to get a referral to a public psych assessment (but this will likely take months).\n\n If you can afford it after the assessment, attending therapy will free up more time in your schedule than it takes up. It's such a valuable resource to help keep you focused on school. \n\nStep two for me was to bring that assessment copy, noting what I was diagnosed with, to the accessibility centre. This essentially was the fast-track pass that got me the help and access to the resources that I needed and now I am back to making dean's list every semester. \n\nShit gets rough sometimes, but you've got this. Just a couple more hurdles to jump through and it will be so much easier.",

The fact that you\u2019re telling me I\u2019m entitled and I\u2019m suffering from egomania shows who\u2019s really the asshole who knows nothing. Any advisor I get help from, I thank them for any advice they give me and never show any sort of disrespect or ungratefullness. \n\nYou\u2019re just another dickhead who hides behind a throwaway account who\u2019s insecure and dishes out their hatred feelings towards other people online who\u2019s seeking help and have a better heart then you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re so upset and full of hate and I appreciate your kind words!",

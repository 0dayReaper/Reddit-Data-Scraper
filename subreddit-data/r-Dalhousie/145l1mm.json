    "postText": "I\u2019m a BSc student thats going into my first year this fall, I\u2019m wanting to major in bio and I need a math corse. I hate math with a burning passion, I can do it, but I am by no means very good at it. It suggests to do math 1215, 1000, or 1030. Im wondering what someone would suggest for someone looking to major in bio to go into, who isn\u2019t very good at math. With maybe a patient prof who would be willing to help me a lot because I\u2019ll probably need it.",

            "comment": "I am going into my second year of marine bio, I\u2019m pretty sure Math 1215 is suggested if you\u2019re going the science (biology) route. It was very easy, you\u2019re allowed formula sheets during the exams. You\u2019re not allowed a calculator, but the content was simple enough that you wouldn\u2019t need one anyways. \n\n\nAs evidence at its simplicity, I went through all the lectures the week before the exam was (skipped lectures and went through the slides just before finals - which I do NOT recommend doing) but I passed the class in the 80% without putting any effort in",

Math 1030 is linear algebra and is only necessary if you are doing math/statistics. math 1215 is for the life sciences and it is less heavy than math 1000. keep in mind you will also have to take stat 1060 if you are pursuing a BSc in biology.",

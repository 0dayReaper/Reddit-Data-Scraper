However if math is scary for you you could always switch into applied computer science which does management instead of math. I just finished my second year and switched into applied computer science and I\u2019m only going to have to complete 5 extra classes.\nHowever if you are going into computer science just for the salaries you\u2019re in it for the wrong reasons. The required courses are very demanding and if you\u2019re not truly interested in the subject it will be very hard. Not meaning to deter you but you have to be in this field for the good reasons or else it will be very difficult.",

I transferred after 2nd year and I am only missing 4 of the classes that are required up to this point. You will definitely have to complete a couple management courses that are done in first year I\u2019m not too sure how hard they are as I\u2019m taking them in the fall and winter. I would say the process is pretty straightforward however you should contact an academic advisor before to talk about your specifics. All I had to do was create a new application as an existing student and fill out some basic information, wait a couple of weeks and pay a deposit that\u2019s applied to my account so it paid for a bit of my course. Unless you\u2019re failing every single class they will pretty much allow you to switch into bacs. If you have any questions you can also message me",

I don\u2019t know if it was the professor that\u2019s known to not be great or what but I wasn\u2019t too interested in all of that low level programming and the proofs in 2115 which made me switch out of it after a week or so of classes. I personally feel like the management classes will be easier than the math classes. I also don\u2019t know how statically accurate it is but from the few grads I have talked to they were able to get more managerial positions or were able to progress out of the programmer role and progress in the company faster and also making more money which is also a bonus",

I'm like really bad with STEM as a whole and was hoping some of you might have some suggestions for \"easy\" science courses for someone who isn't great in the subject. Thanks!!!",

            "comment": "Most people I know who took a BA that required STEM courses took the two intro psych classes - I think that these are the most common choices since psych is a degree that offers both a BSc and BA option. Therefore, while the intro psych classes count as STEM credits, I\u2019ve heard from those who took them while doing a BA, that their opinion is that these are very BA friendly courses, even for people to tend to have some difficulties with other science courses (mainly because they aren\u2019t biology, physics, chemistry, or math heavy WHATSOEVER - so the intro to psych courses are run more like other BA courses than other BSc courses in general). \n\nERTH1030 is also one that I\u2019ve known multiple BA students who\u2019ve taken it for science credits.",

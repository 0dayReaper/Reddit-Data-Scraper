That way every other week you'd get a solid block to get some work done between 10 am (after your first class) and before cpst at 530 or 6 whenever it starts",

I don\u2019t know how the lectures are scheduled for first years this time around, but last year the morning chemistry/physics classes were all interchangeable and you can show up to whichever time slot. It would only matter when you had to write midterms.",

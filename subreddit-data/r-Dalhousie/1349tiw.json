If so, are they easy to get/register for? My main ideas are to major in either CS or Commerce but I\u2019m still looking around at many other ideas. Any knowledge is appreciated!",

There aren\u2019t too many options and I doubt an entire undergraduate degree would be possible but I haven\u2019t looked thoroughly (maybe a taught masters). I would imagine it would be easier to enroll at a university that specializes in online learning like Athabasca.",

If you are looking for remote learning I would suggest an institution that specializes in it. A lot of courses \u201cwent online\u201d during covid and some kept a pseudo online version but if a course wasn\u2019t designed to be remote you may not get what you think out of it.",

The only thing is, even with some online courses, the exams can sometimes be in-person. If you are needing online because you won\u2019t be able to live near campus, I was talking to an advisor and they did say you could write your exam at whatever university is close to you (under their supervision). \n\nOverall, I\u2019d just suggest talking to a Dal student advisor, they\u2019ll have better answers for you.",

    "postText": "Hi! In like May 2017 or 2018 after the semester finished, I went to a huge yard sale event at the Sexton gym with a variety of items for sale - appliances, clothing, furniture, etc. IIRC it was all items that had been left/donated by students moving out of residence. Does anyone know if this is still going on? I can't seem to find any info online so I'm assuming it was stopped a while ago, but thought I'd check. Thanks!",

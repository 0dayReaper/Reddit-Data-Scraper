There are definitely places (with roommates) for rent in the $700-800 range on FB marketplace and kijijji but you have to be QUICK. Most places, however are $850-1100 a month everything included, unless you\u2019re looking for a single bedroom or studio apt.",

Groceries are expensive now (thank you inflation) so expect to spend around 200-300$/month. Other expenses would be paying for electricity, water, wifi etc. and miscellaneous expenses like clothing, etc.",

    "postText": "Hey Dal students, rather than distributing information across multiple Reddit threads/posts, I would like to create one **masterpost** to contain discussion about the strike that was announced this morning by CUPE 3912 and will affect over 1700 academic workers at Dalhousie starting **October 19th** (Wednesday) next week. Many of these workers are **also students** so we recognize the need for collaboration &amp; coordination with CUPE 3912 for communications to support our community's collective best interests. **Comment on this post with your question.** Formal communications from DSU to follow tomorrow (Thursday, Oct 13)\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions //** *Subject to updates &amp; edits as more questions come in.*\n\n**1) What's going on?**\n\nFrom CUPE 3912:\n\n&gt;Due to the Employer\u2019s refusal to offer us fair wages and working conditions, we have decided to call a strike and **stop working at Dalhousie on**: October 19\n\nFor a primer on the context leading up to the strike announcement, please see the [DSU Statement](https://www.dsu.ca/news-releases/2022/9/29/the-dalhousie-students-union-stands-in-solidarity-with-dalhousie-tas-and-ptas-demanding-living-wages-and-fair-working-conditions#_ftn1) as well as CUPE 3912's website [cupe3912.ca](https://cupe3912.ca).\n\n**2) Who constitutes a member of CUPE 3912? What if I'm a member?**\n\nIf you are a member of CUPE 3912 at Dalhousie University, **you are on strike starting October 19th**. **You are an affected CUPE 3912 member if you currently are or in the past 36 months were: part-time faculty, a teaching assistant or a marker/demonstrator at Dalhousie University.** Please get in touch with CUPE 3912 ASAP to understand your rights &amp; expectations during this time. They are running virtual &amp; in-person Q&amp;As every single day this week as per [this schedule](https://cupe3912.ca/2022/10/09/more-strike-qa-sessions-october-11-14/) but you can also email/contact your respective Officers as per contact info given [here](https://cupe3912.ca/about/officers/). *You need to be signing up for strike pay IN PERSON. There is a sign-up sheet at the Student Union Building's front desk.* I will not answer any further questions that should be directed to CUPE 3912 leadership.\n\n**3) What happens during a strike? What does it mean to picket? What does it mean to cross the picket line?**\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with labour relations terminology &amp; what a strike entails, see this FAQ page on the CUPE 3912 website: [https://cupe3912.ca/bargaining/strike-faq/](https://cupe3912.ca/bargaining/strike-faq/)\n\n**4) How will the CUPE 3912 strike next week work?**\n\n**ALL DUTIES** covered by CUPE 3912 contracts will stop. This means lectures, tutorials, meeting with students, and marking will not be done during the duration of the strike. Dalhousie **will not be paying** CUPE 3912 until the strike ends and work is resumed. During the strike, CUPE 3912 members will be picketing at predetermined locations to be released the day of the strike. Students are welcome to join.\n\n**5) What was the timeline of events? How did we get here?**\n\n[Here](https://cupe3912.ca/bargaining/dalhousie/at-a-glance/) is a more technical overview of the Dal CUPE 3912's bargaining &amp; the 2-year plus timeline over which negotiations have been taking place before this breakdown.\n\n**6) What was the latest offer Dalhousie made?**\n\nCUPE 3912 has a detailed bargaining update [here](https://cupe3912.ca/2022/10/06/dalhousie-bargaining-update/)\n\n**7) How long will the strike be?**\n\nAs long as it takes Dalhousie to propose a fair deal. Negotiations have been going on for over 2 years. Should there be sufficient pressure even before the strike is set to begin and a fair deal proposed, we won't have to endure any disruptions to learning &amp; teaching delivery.\n\n**8) How can students support the strike?**\n\n* Don't cross the picket line by not going to your classes if you can. The DSU is in the process of getting academic amnesty (accommodations) to support students wishing to support the strike this way.\n* Wear pink/white &amp; CUPE 3912 pins while on campus.\n* Picket with CUPE 3912 members once picket locations are announced\n* Ideally, we don't have a strike at all or limit the duration of the strike as much as possible. **Email members of the Dalhousie bargaining team** to indicate your support for CUPE 3912's demands and how a strike would impact you to increase pressure for a fair deal &amp; the swift resolution to negotiations.\n* Signal your solidarity as publicly as possible on any communication channels you have at your disposal\n* Sign CUPE 3912's petition to reinforce their advocacy: [https://www.change.org/p/tell-dalhousie-s-executive-board-that-tas-and-ptas-deserve-better-than-a-pay-cut-3e7900d7-bff6-4ab6-910d-e76050c9f60f](https://www.change.org/p/tell-dalhousie-s-executive-board-that-tas-and-ptas-deserve-better-than-a-pay-cut-3e7900d7-bff6-4ab6-910d-e76050c9f60f)\n\n**Dalhousie's Academic Relations Staff / Bargaining Team**\n\n|*Name*|*Position*|*Email*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Laura Neals|Director of Academic Staff Relations|[Laura.Neals@dal.ca](mailto:Laura.Neals@dal.ca)|\n|Marlo Shinyei|Manager of Academic Staff Relations / Chief Negotiator|[Marlo.Shinyei@dal.ca](mailto:Marlo.Shinyei@dal.ca)|\n|Miriam (Mimi) Breslow|HR Advisor (Postdoctoral Fellows)|[Miriam.Breslow@dal.ca](mailto:Miriam.Breslow@dal.ca)|\n|Dipti Periwal|HR Advisor (Faculty Recruitment)|[Dipti.Periwal@dal.ca](mailto:Dipti.Periwal@dal.ca)|\n|Jennifer Dooks|Data Coordinator|[Jennifer.Dooks@dal.ca](mailto:Jennifer.Dooks@dal.ca)|\n\nThrow in our President's email [Deep.Saini@dal.ca](mailto:Deep.Saini@dal.ca) while you're at it.\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nDSU President",

We have not yet confirmed academic amnesty/accommodations for students who want to picket during classes though. If this option is not available to you, then picket between classes and wear CUPE 3912 merch to your classes to support. You can also write to Dal's bargaining team, the President and the Board of Governors.",

I imagine it cant just be any student, it has to be employed students so I image a ton of random students that are not involved in CUPE 3912 are going to see free first aid training and jump on it making filtering out the captains harder to do.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, likewise has it been confirmed that regular students get to be payed as well if they help the strike? Isn't our union was paying us specifically to strike? I think the way its worded now might make it seem to any student they will get paid for their involvement when I don't think thats the case, once again I might be wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnothing against regular students helping the strike but I feel this is going to have unintended consequences for the strike organizing team",

There is more than just a wage issues at stake here. It\u2019s the hard work and future of thousands of students that will be affected by this. \n\nI really hope that anyone who supports this strike understand that not everyone does.

Strikes and protests ARE disruptive and inconvenient which is why they're a powerful bargaining chip only wielded as a last resort by workers. It's why our TAs &amp; PTAs only decided on this as a last resort after *two whole years* of negotiations and the absence of a collective agreement.\n\nWe also have been hearing from students about declining satisfaction in quality of education over the course of these two years, in particular many students sharing that the vast majority of their interaction with a course is through TAs. Many of our TAs are also fellow students. Everyone is increasingly stretched thin and our instructors' working conditions are our learning conditions.\n\nAlso, interesting for you to reference Quebec protests in 2012. I don't mean to undermine or invalidate your experience but those protests *led to years of Quebec having the lowest domestic tuition fees across the country.* We all owe our freedoms to the people who fought for it before us and it's on us to keep paying it forward.",

However, I don\u2019t think penalizing students is the way to go. I also understand that negotiations have been going on for 2 years and haven\u2019t lead to an agreement. I would like to point out that Dalhousie is not the only one at fault here. Yes they have been refusing some of the demands made but both parties have to come to an agreement and be willing to compromise. This is not me saying that CUPE 3912 is the reason there is no agreement yet either. \n\nYou are right, Quebec does have the lowest tuition in the country. In fact, for people who don\u2019t know, tuitions are less then half of what we pay here in Nova Scotia. That being said, the movement was to protest against a raise in tuition which wasn\u2019t even bringing it to half what it cost here or in most other provinces. The reason I brought it up is because some students protesting in2012 went too far, creating unsafe situations on campus (blocking access to classes/buildings, using force, insulting and treating other student). I hope this protest stay peaceful for that reason. On top of that, some students had their degree highly affected. Losing class and lab hours, losing access to internship, semesters aboard or even had to retake classes because they couldn\u2019t complete courses. I was lucky enough to be able to complete my semester but it wasn\u2019t without some issues including having to go through hoops and loops to go to class.",

We love what we do and we care about our students. We have spent TWO YEARS trying to negotiate so that strike action could be avoided. What else are we supposed to do? Continue to be taken advantage of? Continue to be disrespected? No.\n\nThe union leaders are calling for students to get mad and ask for their money back from Dal. Will that work? Maybe not. But Dal is a business and you are that business's client. This is a huge failing on the part of the business and that's the management's fault, not ours. Your tuition goes up 3% every year and where is that money going?? It's going to pay for a private golf membership for the president and give him a 13% raise on his 500k salary, but us asking for a basic cost of living raise is too much.\n\nEditing to add that Dal's bargaining team literally told the union to \"go on strike if you want to\" when they gave us their most recent offer. That's rude as hell and if anything shows how little respect Dal has for the union workers and how little Dal cares about how this will affect the community. One could say we're just doing what Dal told us to do \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

However, I do not support the strike because it is taking away learning opportunities for students, in this case, labs and tutorial. I do believe that, while you learn a lot in class, lab and tutorials at an important part of the learning process in University. Experience and knowledge comes from practice, not just reading or listening to a presentation.",

Labs and tutorials are really important, which is why the staff that run them should be treated fairly and equitable. Dalhousie has history of trying to fuck over its employees every which way besides the ones at the very top.\n\nBy not supporting the strike however, it's clear you side with the university and it's abysmal treatment of CUPE members. That's fine, it's just a bad look in my opinion.",

The very fact CUPE 3912 was considering a strike allowed for additional negotiations/meetings to take place however Dal recently presented their final offer and apparently told our CUPE negotiating team to \"strike if you want to.\" This indicates lack of faith on their part that CUPE 3912 can mobilize &amp; rally the community around supporting them. That, and this cavalier response indicates institutional complacency in our academic infrastructure when in fact it would crumble without our precarious academic workers.  \n\nTo avert the strike, the Dalhousie community needs to prove them wrong and do so quickly. Last-minute-miracles (i.e. a fair deal dropping the night before the strike starts) DO happen &amp; have at Dal but they require early, strong, public solidarity &amp; pressure.",

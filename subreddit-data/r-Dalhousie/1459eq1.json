    "postText": "Hi there! I\u2019m going into my first year as a BCS student and was planning to take CSCI 1300 but am considering MATH 1000, even though I currently don\u2019t have plans to pursue a minor in Math like it says on suggested courses. \n\nMATH 1000 seems to be needed in the sciences and while I\u2019m not as interested in that space as I am CS, giving myself the options doesn\u2019t seem like a bad idea. Considering that people tend to alter or change their path throughout Uni, I\u2019m thinking MATH 1000 for the sake of possibility (plus it fits better in my schedule lol).\n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019ve always questioned the relevance of the Math I\u2019ve done so far. Seeing how Calc applies directly to CS could be valuable. I want to understand the connection. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nDoes it even matter much?",

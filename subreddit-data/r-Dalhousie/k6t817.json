    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nI plan on sending out a letter to the register's office and the DSU in hopes of creating a Syllabus archive. My sister, who attends U of T, has access to this archive at her school, so why not at dal too?\n\nWhy?\n\n* The archive will let students see what courses are like and what the mark breakdown will be without having to chase people down who had taken the course in the past.\n* When I register for courses, I try to balance three difficult courses and two easy ones, so the syllabus archive will allow me to see what kind of workload those courses will bring, and I can plan accordingly.\n* The only place the has past syllabi available is Coursehero and outdated ones on the Dal website, so students are often left begging profs for them.\n* by having the archive, students and profs don't have to waste time sending or finding syllabi online\n* I am sure that many of you have applied to other schools and needed past syllabi but didn't have them, and the ones on the dal website are outdated from 2018. The archive will allow you to access those for future applications.\n* If you apply for a master's degree, you may need past syllabi, and this archive will provide just that.\n\nAs a second-year student at Dal, I am now aware of the importance of keeping my past syllabi, but in my first year, I wasn't, and now I just finished emailing 14 professors for past syllabi, only three replied. Regardless I think many students will benefit from this and don't have to access shady websites that claim to have past syllabi\n\nAfter the exams, I will write the letter, but I needed some opinions and some advice on this to be implemented by the DSU.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ivr0fwx1g8361.png?width=1007&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e79fc5985b76c0c96d6e85eddaed733e456e0a4a",

It would also be nearly impossible to do transfer credit audits without at least some part of a syllabus like learning outcomes. \n\nMy old college has one of these and it\u2019s super convenient for finding syllabi for courses I\u2019ve already taken. Currently the process at Dal is you have to ask the professor for it and that can be hard for sessional instructors like me who tend to switch institutions and have to monitor many university emails. \n\nBasically all that\u2019s needed is to make the records publicly available and it would be beneficial.",

I even asked an admin friend afterwards that works for a few of the profs, and she said it would be difficult to get without contacting each specific prof to see if they had the syllabi still.",

And since the syllabus for the upcoming course wouldn\u2019t be ready in time for registration you\u2019d be going off old versions. Just something to keep in mind, I got someone\u2019s old syllabus for a class once and the prof completely restructured their breakdown and nearly doubled the readings and it bit me in the ass.",

If ppl want this to happen, it will build itself.\n\nEdit: Before I get any hate, I go to McGill and we\u2019ve done this with great success on our own as students. We even have our own website and google drive with thousands of summary notes, course outlines, and Syllabui. I think some people get tired of waiting around for change from incompetent university administration and just do it themselves.",

It\u2019s, all things considered, a pretty chill course, the lecturer is very nice, no exams, and every week a researcher comes in to talk about their work. Gives you a good idea of the field you\u2019ll go into :)",

I just took it, and during the second semester there were half as many students still in the course (they didn\u2019t drop it because it was too hard or anything, the course work is easy) - so they\u2019ll probably let you join the course",

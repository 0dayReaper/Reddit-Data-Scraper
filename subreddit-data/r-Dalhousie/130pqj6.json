With only 2,400 beds, our Halifax residence system does not currently have the inventory to meet the demand.\n\nAs you know, Nova Scotia\u2019s market for affordable rental units is among the tightest in Canada. In fact, according to the latest CMHC rental market report, the vacancy rate in Halifax stood at just 1% as of October 2022, while the average monthly rent for a 2-bedroom apartment has gone up 9.3% between 2021 and 2022.\n\nHow can you help?\nWe are taking the unprecedented step today of reaching out to our own Dal community \u2013 staff, faculty, and alumni \u2013 to ask the following: if you (or someone you know) have a spare room in your residence or a rental unit available, please consider listing it for a student.\n\nOne of the best and easiest ways of doing this is through our Off-campus Housing Office and Places4Students \u2013 an online directory of available student accommodations. Dalhousie has had a successful and longstanding partnership with Places4Students. A new added benefit of the partnership is there is no cost to use this listing service as of spring 2023.\n\nSo, whether you\u2019re looking to advertise an available room or apartment, or you know a student looking for housing, Places4Students can be accessed for free. Please note that Dalhousie does not play a role in vetting listings, landlords, or prospective tenants.\n\nThank you very much for considering this request, and for being part of the solution. With your support, along with the support of a growing network of government and not-for-profit housing services, we can do our bit to help address the housing crisis for our students.\n\nWe thank you for your consideration.\n\nRick Ezekiel\nVice-Provost, Student Affairs\n\nChris Hattie\nAssistant Vice-President, Human Resources (Acting)\n\nHeather Sutherland\nAssistant Vice-President, Ancillary Services\n\nDalhousie University is located in Mi'kma'ki, the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi`kmaq. We are all treaty people.\n\nWe recognize that African Nova Scotians are a distinct people whose histories, legacies and contributions have enriched that part of Mi\u2019kma\u2019ki known as Nova Scotia for over 400 years.",

People from Ontario-Westwards largely get the choice to remain in-province and still attend a prestigious university. Not the same for people from the Maritimes.",

If you haven\u2019t talked to a drooling UoT student, you haven\u2019t talked to enough of them. The illustriousness of our post-secondaries has diminished across the country since undergrad became a requirement to get a \u201cdecent\u201d job, and a master\u2019s became the new distinction.\n\nMaybe Dal isn\u2019t better across the board, but we shine in some spots. I abhor the tendency to rank people by their alma mater - we produce some excellent graduates like any other school. Employers or others who look down their nose at Dal grads for its rank are, at best, lazy and elitist IMO.\n\n&gt;\tHas the engineering accreditation crisis already faded from living memory among undergrad students?\n\nTry googling it and see.

So if grandma paid $16k for her house in 1955 she doesn\u2019t go homeless, but if Joe paid $1M for their house they get taxed appropriately. Once people start selling off their \u201crental properties\u201d and air BNB, others can start buying and moving out of the rental stock which should free up space for new residents. \n\nThe secondary effect of this tax is it ties housing to income, so a $250k gift from mom and dad doesn\u2019t distort the cost of housing because little Joe, Sally, or insert name can only buy a home they can afford to pay the tax on.",

They did, however, start the first housing boom by introducing zero down cash back mortgages and 40 yr amortization. He walked it back after the 2008 crisis though.\n\nHousing doubled under them, and it has doubled again under the current government.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do agree that these permit times need to come down though. Hopefully it is something that can be tackled at the federal level.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/daniel\\_foch/status/1651601259638530048?s=61&amp;t=jd5lfeTIIqmFqzr5yad3Tg",

And with midterm it is literally almost the exact same as the practice test so if you go through the practice and understand how to do each question you\u2019ll do well. For the final, I also made sure to understand everything on the practice tests but dive a little deeper into in class examples and you should be just fine. I finished this class with an A so if you have any other questions let me know.",

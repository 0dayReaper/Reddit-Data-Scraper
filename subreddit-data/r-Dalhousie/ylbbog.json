    "postText": "I\u2019m in my first year of my undergrad and the FIRST WEEK I got to campus, I saw that CUPE members were at risk of a strike. I asked everyone I could what the plan was, what would happen if they striked. Up until the day before the strike everyone told me to just hold out hope they would reach an agreement even though I could plainly see a strike was inevitable.\n\nNow they\u2019re sending out propaganda emails trying to get us distrusting of the union. I genuinely believe that the lack of a publicized plan for the courses that have been suspended is a tactic to sow discontent with the union in the student population. Apparently we have no hope of any kind of information until AFTER reading week? The semester is practically over by then.\n\nWhy the hell wasn\u2019t anyone in charge of drawing up a plan for this very real possibility in September? In august? It\u2019s embarrassing for the university, and doesn\u2019t inspire confidence. It\u2019s all \u201ccontact accommodations if you need something\u201d I don\u2019t know what I need until I know the nature of my two courses that have been suspended!",

I also think dal is trying to figure out a way that would require them to avoid giving refunds which is a harder process.",

If an 18 year old undergrad can see that a strike is coming on September 10th, why haven\u2019t there been people working on a plan at least since then, if not before. \n\nThey told the union they would NEED to strike if they wanted more than the measly offer they walked away from.

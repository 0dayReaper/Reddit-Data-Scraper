    "postText": "Has anyone else been feeling entirely overwhelmed? I've had an insane amount of assignments due the past couple weeks and so many this semester, I have closed book exams worth virtually nothing, I never know if I'll get 1 or 2 lectures/week for one of my courses (or how long theyll be or when theyll be released... doesnt say in the syllabus), my profs talk incredibly fast, some of my lecture recordings are consistently longer than class time, and I have so much to do over the break week. My lectures all seem to have lengthened the past week and I have no idea how I'm supposed to do everything. I'm trying to maintain my A average and in my 3rd year, so all my marks count towards entrance into a MSc. My grades are good right now, but I'm worried I'm getting too burnt out to keep them okay. My mental and physical health are not great right now because of the stress. I'm trying to stay on top of the gym and meditating, but I'm having nightmares about school and almost always feel like I'm drowning from stress. This semester is affecting me in ways I really didn't ever consider and I'm doing way more work than I usually do yet somehow more behind than I've ever been. I'm sorry for the rant, I just feel so overwhelmed and alone and am wondering if it's just my mental illness (anxiety disorder) or if this is being felt by others. I'm so sorry if anyone else is feeling like this and sorry if this just comes off as whining. I feel so lost and hopeless and am at a loss. I'm going to have to take today off work just because I'm too stressed to function and feel like I'm dooming myself by taking 1 day off.",

We were all trudging through the shit together, and we helped each other get through our bad days.\n\nI'm not sure I would've stuck with it if I didn't have that confirmation from others of \"yeah, this is hard, it's not just you struggling.\"\n\nSo, in case you haven't heard it recently: Yeah, this is hard. It's not just you. You're doing just as well as everyone else, even if it doesn't feel like it sometimes. Keep it up. You'll get there soon.",

I\u2019ve had jobs working 60-80 hour weeks solo and it was a nightmare, and I\u2019ve had weeks working 100+ hours and it was bearable because you were in the shit with other people.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between being alone and being lonely, and I think online learning very quickly forces everyone to be lonely. It\u2019s a cancer and if I wasn\u2019t so close to being done with school I\u2019d have taken the year off tbh.",

I don\u2019t stop working, I live at my desk, and voice my concerns I am met with how I need \u201cbetter time management\u201d or \u201cthis is suppose to be your hardest semester\u201d. Well it\u2019s a little hard to manage my time accordingly when lectures are exceeding the time constraints of what they used to be in a classroom setting, having multiple tests for the same class be due on the same day while trying to complete tasks for other classes all due on the same day. Last week I had 8 major things due within 24 hours, and still got push back from instructors when asking for extensions, because some of those assignments were given with a 3-4 day completion time. \nI\u2019m doing my best, but it\u2019s hard when profs can\u2019t even be bothered to answer emails, even with sending multiple follow ups.",

I\u2019m already vastly underpaid for the amount of work I have to do, and that\u2019s on top of research and thesis writing. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have enough hours in my contract to answer students emails outside of my \u201coffice hours\u201d, which are 3 hours one afternoon per week. I really want to help, because the other two TAs don\u2019t know nearly as much as I do about the subject matter (I design all the lab experiments, the lab exam, and even some midterm and assignment questions and practice questions), but for my own mental health I can\u2019t. I just don\u2019t have any more bandwidth.\n\nThe departments need way, way, way more money for teaching assistants, and the teaching assistants should be paid at minimum $35 an hour. Maybe you could justify paying markers less, but I\u2019m arrogant enough to assume that there\u2019s no grad student you could slot into my spot that would do a better job than I do in the courses I TA. It\u2019s fucking ridiculous that I get paid $100 an hour to teach private seminars on much more basic material than I\u2019m being paid $20 an hour to TA. Fucking ridiculous.",

Also why I opt for emailing the prof before the TA. In one of my classes the prof can\u2019t even be bothered to do anything and has the TA has basically doing everything. I don\u2019t want to generalize all profs, but I do feel like this semester the majority of them just don\u2019t seem to care, which is making me give up more and more with each passing day.",

I don\u2019t blame him: he has office hours that no students take advantage of (likely because they\u2019re so busy and stressed that they have no time to schedule themselves to ask for help like that). Students typically don\u2019t take advantage of my office hours to get live feedback either, which I personally find supremely frustrating because it would typically take me 5 minutes to explain something as opposed to 15 minutes to type out the e-mail explanation. The fun part of being a TA for me is when I get to see that I\u2019m helping students succeed. When I can\u2019t see or hear that (reading it in e-mail isn\u2019t the same), I get less satisfaction from my work.\n\nI think some profs take advantage of TAs and I think it\u2019d be worth it for the grad students of each department to be their own negotiating body as opposed to CUPE. No shade to other programs but there\u2019s a big difference between standing around in a seminar room doing practice problems, and actively teaching someone how to design and build the hardware and software necessary to get a robot to autonomously run an obstacle course and update you with its location and completed tasks in real time. But both those jobs pay the same wages? Get the fuck outta here with that bullshit.",

They give you a nearly immediate dose, and a second one later. When I resort to melatonin on truly sleepless nights, I nearly always wake up three hours later if I take regular tablets.",

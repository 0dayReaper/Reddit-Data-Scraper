But depending on the prof, some do round so you may get an A-\n\nA lot of profs specify their rounding policies in their syllabus. Did they have anything about if they round or not in there?",

Personally, I\u2019d suggest it is likely you will get an A- because 79.705 is closer to 80 than 79, but that\u2019s purely speculation on my part. \n\nI will say though that both a B+ and an A- are worth being proud of. Nice job!",

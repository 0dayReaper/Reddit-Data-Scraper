I\u2019ve recently gotten an offer for the Bachelor of Science (Kinesiology) at Dal as an international student. \nIt\u2019s gonna be my first time in Canada and I\u2019m a bit nervous lol \nAre there any tips/ info about the course that some of you could share? (Good professors, dorm choices, how\u2019s the course in general, managing a part-time job while in the course, ect)\nThanks\ud83d\ude0a!",

If something is tough for you (physics for a lot of kin kids) then get a tutor before the class even starts. Put in the time for those harder classes and enjoy the treat that are the easier ones.",

The majority of the profs are reasonable if you are respectful in your emailing, and are genuine. First year was a breeze, Second year is brutal, the rest is fine. By the end of your 4 years you'll be on a first name basis with a lot of profs. \n\n3. My biggest piece of advice: Put in the graft, and if you're having problems with content - don't be afraid to email for an appointment and go to office hours (with your notes prepared). \n\n\nFeel free to message me with more questions. Just know I'm in PT school now, and I am under a pile of workload, so I might be delayed in responding",

Im graduating this school though it is a fact that so many students give up studying cs as it requires subjects where you have to apply math knowledge, and evem if you are good at math and good at learning knowledge of cs, coding is totally different story lol , and you have to practice coding , applying the algorithm you learn, which makes cs much harder than others. I should have studied science and applied dental school like my brother as it is much easier. Fyi, if you are extremely good at math and coding before you enter the university, studying cs is really good like bill gates lol",

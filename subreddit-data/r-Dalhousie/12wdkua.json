A finance calculator since you\u2019ll do TVA and stuff, you can get it in the bookstore or Amazon, just the BA II I believe from Texas Instruments. The content is pretty straight forward and if you\u2019re doing Bloomberg in the Rowe make sure you do that as early as possible to have it done. Practice questions for this course is the best way to study!",

    "postText": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI am Adam Lucas. I ran in the 2019 DSU presidential race on a satirical platform and now that the dust has settled I would like to issue some remarks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Remark 1:**\n\nOne of the most interesting parts of this project was noting the various conjectures put forward about who I am and why I did this. My motivations were threefold:\n\n\\-I thought it would be really fun; it was.\n\n\\-I wanted to criticize the DSU, the apparent self importance of their insiders, and the relentless politicization of the union. For those who think I should not have been allowed to run I will say that satire is a legitimate and important part of democracy; not that I wish to imply that the DSU is by any means democratic.\n\n\\-Peer pressure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Remark 2:**\n\nWho I am exactly is not so important as what I assure you I am not. I am not:\n\n\\-A user of  /pol/, /b/, /r9k/, or 4chan and other image boards and internet \"communities\". I made a reddit account in order to make this post and aid future projects. I am not an incel or an internet guy, even my creative partner who managed the social media and made the memes has little background there. Although we used memes in our campaign I will note that many of them are very old and of a mainstream format and nature. I am responsible to my campaign materials but I will also note that I had little to do with their creation beyond the original concepts found in my manifesto and other materials. Not that I condemn them; I signed off on each one.\n\n\\-I am not Far-Right, Alt-Right, Alt-Light, Libertarian, Republican, or any other member of such a list. In fact some of my initial jokes for the debate made fun of these groups but I cut them in order to remain more focused on the DSU. I also chose bits that focused on common human \"isms\" like \"I am going to be prime minister\" and \"I care about X issue because it disproportionately affects the poor\" again to be less political and more universal.\n\n\\-I am not a fan of Evan Jeddore. I was not influenced by him in any way. The only impact he made on me was through the debate rules that they amended because of him. I even had to follow special restrictions on top of these (highly undemocratic). I imagine future candidates will have to follow even harsher ones because of me.\n\n\\- As I said in my Gazette interview after I got thrown out of the debate, which I doubt will ever be published, I am a \" continental philosopher and a wittgensteinian russophile\" (The latter is generally true). That is the most I will say about who I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Remark 3:**\n\nI must say that I will never again take freedom of expression/speech for granted and I encourage the reader to do the same. I will retain a lifelong respect for true democracy, procedural fairness, and due process as a result of my mistreatment by the DSU. I will still make fun of it all but I will definitely mean it a little less when it comes to those things. I encourage the reader to do the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Remark 4:**\n\nI will note this whole saga should also be taken as a caution about the future. Please consider that the very people I had to interact with, who ignore even the most basic aspects of procedural fairness and due process, are the same people who seek to hold real political power and take leadership roles one day. That should be the real take away here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat is most of what I would say. The detailed election results are almost a week late by now. This is strange since they used a third party voting site which I imagine would have compiled these numbers right away. I'm not making any statements here or suggesting that something is up; I'm just pointing it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I will probably pop up some time in the future with another project. We have some ideas but nothing is set in stone as of now. Below is a link to a youtube channel archiving some of my antics during the campaign. This not my personal channel and I am not an active \"creator\" on the platform. Therefore I assure you this is not some shameless plug.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDc2pwIC0r8iCHEjwtP74xQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDc2pwIC0r8iCHEjwtP74xQ)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thanks  to the supporters throughout the campaign and during my disqualification. The judicial board is still reviewing my appeal and you will know very soon after I know their decision. The end is not yet written.\n\n\\-Adam L.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I will note that from my research there appears to be no way they can actually secure those funds without my consent. They cannot charge me through the university as they are a separate entity and can only charge for goods and services rendered. I signed nothing besides my candidate questionnaire, which they failed to publish, and have no legal obligations. Even if I did have legal obligations I would be quite content to show this situation, and the poorly written notice of disqualification, to an actual judge. They can't even kick me out of the union from what I understand so there seems to be nothing they can do. If I had won the race they might have some leverage but this is not the case.  \n\n\nI never have and will not fold to the DSU. We will continue to oppose tyranny through songs and love.

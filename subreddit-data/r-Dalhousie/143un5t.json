    "postText": "Hi I'm currently in 2nd is Dal \n\nI'm in science program and planning to change to nursing in Fall 2024 if it's possible. \n\nI am going to take CHEM, MICI, ANAT, ENGL, and PHYL during Fall semester and take STAT, PHYL, and two open electives during winter semester. Since I am taking STAT (pre-requisite courses) in winter term, I will not be able to get make before May. In this case can I still apply for nursing this year or do I really have to wait until next year?   \n\n\nI got poor marks during my 1st year and try to retake some courses to make my GPA Higher. Last year I got ILL mark for STAT course. \n\nIs there anyone who knows what should I do?",

Your fall semester does look a bit heavy. \nI started the prerequisites in Fall 2021 and realized my semester was way to heavy for me to get the grades I needed (my goal was *at least* an A- in each class). I ended up reducing my course load and then for fall of 2022 I took my writing credit (PERF 1000), PHYL, and MICI. Then in winter 2023 I took STAT, PHYL and a science elective BIOL 1021.\nIt took me a year longer than I thought to get in, but I\u2019m starting in AS fall 23.",

For my STAT and MICI were the hardest so I split them up, it could be good for you if you are confident in the electives.\n\nI would also recommend reaching out to an academic advisor. It is possible that you have already completed a science elective or open electives.",

Some of the lecture recordings were of in-person lectures, and all of them are from 2021. The recording of the in-person lectures contain lots of coughing or the professor is referring to a diagram that is written on the board (that we cannot see), sometimes the professor walks away from the mic and you can hardly hear them.\n\nIt was my least favourite prerequisite, I wish I could have done the in person version they offer. Dr. Coombs was there to email if we had questions, and she ran the weekly tutorial, but she was not in any of the recorded lectures. All of the lectures were done by different doctors that work at the hospital.",

If you didn\u2019t get good grades during your first year, I would recommend spreading those courses out where possible (specifically CHEM, MICI, and PHYL). \n\nHowever, if you are enrolled in and completing all of the prerequisites by May of next year, then you can apply for Fall 2024 when applications open this year. I did it a few years ago.",

I took ANAT1010, MICI1100, PHYL1011, PHYL2041, and STAT1060 during the Fall 2022/23 semester, and did pretty well. However, it was A LOT of work, and I already had a STEM background and healthcare experience. If you took your Fall courses last year, you'll likely find them much easier the second time around, as you'll already know at least some of the material.\n\nYou mentioned that you took an ILL in STAT, so it sounds like you suffered circumstances that interfered with your studies (hence the ILL instead of an F), instead of just not working hard enough or being able to grasp the material. These things happen! If your circumstances have changed for the better, you should find the courses easier this time around \ud83d\udc95",

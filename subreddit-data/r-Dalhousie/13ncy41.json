            "comment": "There are lots of great cafes! Too many to name, unless you want really area specific suggestions. I would also recommend the art gallery and Public library. As the waterfront is opening up, there are lots of great places down there as well. Halifax is fun to walk around in the summer even if you are still a minor! It just depends what kinda stuff you like to do. There's also point pleasant park which is good for hiking (watch out for ticks!). Also try the boardroom Cafe! It's so fun, but make sure to book in advance.",

            "comment": "Seaport farmers market should be open today and that's usually a great little taste of Halifax! \n\nPublic gardens or Point Pleasant are great for a walk. Citadel hill (if it's open) could be cool for you too.  If the Emera Oval in the commons is open you can rent roller skates or bikes for free-I highly recommend milkshakes after at the Freeman's on Quinpool! \n\nAs mentioned the VR and Board Room cafe are great. There's also Trapped Escape Room.  \n\nIf you're willing to go outside Halifax the classic touristy thing is Peggy's Cove, Polly's cove nearby is a great hike along the bluffs with views of Peggy's (it's kind of like a free roam with lots of small trails). \nRainbow Haven beach is quite nice, so is Crystal Crescent (it has trails for a 2nd and 3rd beach-but be weary of the 3rd because it's technically a nude one tho I think you'll be ok in May)",

Highest tidal range in the world, you can walk on the seafloor at low tide. It's really cool. If you don't mind getting a little muddy Burnt Coathead is really cool and fun :) \n\nPoint Pleasant has some cool fort remnants, and is just a lovely park for strolling through. You can see seals there sometimes.\n\nFishermen's cove is a really cute area and has a lot of cute little shops and good seafood.\n\nThe public gardens are beautiful.\n\nYou can go check out the fort on Citadel Hill, they fire a cannon at noon every day.\n\nYou can go visit (what I like to think of as) our city's mascot Gus the tortoise at the natural history museum, he's ~120 years old and he's great and I love him",

Wolfville is about an hour away from Halifax, it's a cute little town in NS that's right on the Bay of Fundy and another good spot for checking it out as well. Look it up on a map and you'll see the bay sits right between the 2 provinces, they both border it pretty evenly.",

You can run audits to see how courses you have taken/are registered in satisfy requirements and different electives. It'll answer lots of your \"do I need to take this\" and \"can I take that\" questions.",

Currently enrolled to graduate with a \u201cconcentration\u201d, which is no longer offered to students who started after 2012. \n\nI have no idea how to read my DARS audit. The academic advisors I talk to also have very conflicting opinions on what I still need to graduate. \n\nDon\u2019t be like me kids.",

            "comment": "DARS works well if you have a nice straightforward academic record - no transfers, a common program, no weird combination of majors/minors. That said, it can be a disaster otherwise. If you\u2019re having trouble, speak to the advisor for your specific program(s) to find out what you need and then have them email the registrars office. I had to have courses manually added into different categories on DARS because the system just couldn\u2019t comprehend having multiple minors and majors and transfer credits. So use DARS as a starting point and then go from there! PS: don\u2019t trust any academic advisor other than your department specific advisor.",

It doesn't have the CS 3000+ and CS 4000+ requirements built in, only the specific core courses and advanced courses in general. \n\nUse the [spreadsheet](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience/current/advising_resources/undergraduate-student-support.html) to track your courses manually. The download is a PDF but you can email [undergrad@cs.dal.ca](mailto:undergrad@cs.dal.ca) to get a copy of your spreadsheet with all of your courses so far filled in. \n\nAlso, the three one-credit co-op courses can combine to fill a free elective but not a CS 3000+/CS 4000+ elective, despite technically being 8000-level courses.",

I had been talking to Science and CS department to decide if I needed one more class For my BS major in CS, It wasn't until I just did DARS that the office let me know I could graduate.  \n\n\nBCS bachelor of computer science is newer, and BS Major in computer Science I think is a relic from before the technical school joined.",

But, since you asked, here\u2019s what it will take for me:\n\n* Enforced attendance for only those who are vaccinated\n* Designated space where the party is kept to\n* Clear and intentional respect for those around you (and in this case, their property)\r\n\nThat\u2019s really it. BTW, I went out and had a few drinks while out this weekend. It was a great time. Letting lose is great and important to do, but hot damn we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic that kills people quickly so we have to be smart about how we let loose. No one\u2019s right to \u2018party\u2019 or even attend home coming is more important than someone else\u2019s right to their health and safety. My advice is to find a way to enjoy yourself in a way that is safe and respectful to those around you during an unprecedent time in all our lives.",

You gunna drink a beer with a thousand different people? You gunna take pictures with strangers passed out under a tree? Maybe get lucky with a puck bunny cause you're wearing a Toronto maple leafs hat? Mio dio. Reality should have hit after you cracked your 3rd beer and realized it was piss warm cause you werent in a HOUSE with a FRIDGE. Or when you had to eat a punch because you accidentally pissed on someone's shoes because you couldnt get to a bathroom. If that didn't bother you maybe you should have realized you were an idiot when your legs got tired after 5 hours of milling around without being able to sit down. Besides being detrimental to a health crisis that has been gripping the world for over a year, that wasnt a party... it was an excuse to be obnoxious because \"WhoS gOInG tO StOp mE? StREnGth iN nuMbERs bAbY wHoOoOoO\" Fucking shocking behaviour from our future nurses, bankers, engineers, dentists, ect..  I've seen the mess yall left behind. You really should hold yourselves to higher standards. Hopefully Dalhousie will as well. HA Just kidding Dal wont do shit and you can all get back to putting daddy's money to good use on booze and coke.",

One main issue I see is people rallying and refusing to acknowledge the risk they\u2019re subjecting the general public to, and these tend to be the same people gathering for reasons that are harder to justify (e.g. partying, anti-mask).",

If, for instance, the government says in their emergency order, no groups larger than 5 outside, than we abide by that. \n\nThe minute anyone tries to justify a reason to break that rule, then anyone can do the same. The only people that have a right to complain are the ones that always followed the rule. \n\nFor me personally, I think BLM protest and climate protest are good events to go to. However, I also think gathering outdoors to drink beer is okay; provided it is respectful and not damaging other property and gets wrapped up before the noise bylaw time. So HoCo was probably a bit too large for my liking. \n\nIf such an issue went to court, your position of BLM protest good, gathering to drink in public bad would win out and I don't deny that. \n\nFrom a university perspective, if they allow students to gather for a climate protest without having to self isolate, than the same should be afforded to people that attend a large party. Breaking bylaws, getting arrested, damaging property etc are fair game though.",

They're why there's a pandemic. They're the only reason why. They're the only group worth getting angry at.\n  \nProperty damage? Sure, but those are specific people guilty of specific acts, not the majority of kids who I mostly saw just standing around--playing beer pong at worst.  \n  \nWas it loud? Sure. But that's what you get living in a neighbourhood called, get this, \"**The Student Ghetto**\". I live downtown, I expect it to be loud every Friday and Sunday. If you live in the **Student Ghetto** you should expect similarly, especially in September.  \n  \nA lot of these people are kids who lost their first year, lost more than half of high school, went and got vaccinated and are now trying to reclaim their stolen youth. Sure, it wasn't the most considerate action. But it's one night, and now it's over. Parties happen. Chaos happens. Spontaneous fun and revelry is as old as Ancient Greece, it's normal, healthy, and frankly I think some of the terminally online people in this subreddit could use a good party to decompress from their internet induced paranoia and desire to inflict state-sanctioned violence and academic and professional flagellation on these people.\n\nIn short, the vast majority who are whining and hand wringing here were never personally affected and are just mad online, which they probably are multiple times a week. The party was outdoors, and therefore probably safer than your average costco visit or the Dome, where they otherwise might have been. We are only still in a pandemic because of unvaccinated people. That's it. That's who to get mad at. Not kids, not 19 year olds desperately trying to enjoy what most people took for granted.",

Not only was everyone gathered, maskless, on public property and on the private property of others, but there is also no way to prove that everyone in attendance had their vaccine. You also can catch COVID and spread it while having the vaccine, and because this event took place on public property and the property of those uninvolved, neighbours were subject to this. There is no such thing as a \"student ghetto\", and although some noise from uni students is to be expected from living in the south end, having hoards of maskless people trespass on your property and block every square inch of the sidewalk of your street is shitty, illegal, and not a victimless crime. It prevents the local families from enjoying the OTHER parts of south-end life such as merely being able to enjoy a coffee on their patio, going for a walk with their dog, going for a jog without serious risks of Covid infection. This is really short-sighted and selfish on the part of everyone in attendance, including yourself. I seriously can't believe you have the gall to publicly admit that you're a shitty person .",

It's strange that you'd think the opinion I expressed is... shameful, even if you disagree with it. The rights of property owners aren't really as important to me as the concept that the streets belong to the people, and that spontanious revelry is natural and OK behaviour. Not condoning people causing damage, but those are specific people, not the majority.  \n\nThere is such thing as the student ghetto, I used to live in it. I know people who live in it now. Most university cities have neighbourhoods where it's well known that students live there and street parties happen.\n  \nThe only reason there is covid is because of the unvaccinated. Simple as that. Idgaf if you can conceivably spread it as a vaccinated person, that person has taken reasonable precautions. If everyone was vaccinated, the R of covid would be low enough that breakthrough cases wouldn't replenish. That's the group who is irresponsible, that's the group we should be angry with.",

I have lived here my entire life and never have I heard of that as the name of a neighbourhood.\n\nYou may be educated in theory but you're really clueless when it comes to public health in practice. There are many individuals with preexisting conditions preventing vaccination. They are not irresponsible for your shitty behaviour and poor life decisions and they deserve to live a healthy life. Children under 12 also are not eligible for vaccinations. Vaccinated people are also at risk of illness and death due to Covid, despite what you may think. You are impeding their livelihood through your actions and violating their rights and that is not okay. If hoco was hosted entirely on private property, that would be totally fine. Because hoco participants outpoured onto the street and other people's lawns, that crossed the line. The venue was not large enough to accommodate the scale of this event though to the point where it literally infringes on the basic human rights of the neighbours. That constitutes being a terrible, disgusting person and I have no sympathy for you, regardless of how hard you try to search for it. I hope karma bites you in the ass.",

The best you can do is take your shot and carry on. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy because it was like \u201cget the vaccine! we can all return to normal and have normal lives\u201d. 97% of students are vaccinated according to dal but now they are being instructed to stay away from school for 1 week and test, regardless of vaccination status. What the fuck was the point??? \n\nYeah i mean some of those students are disgusting assholes but the way things are going, things will never go back to normal..",

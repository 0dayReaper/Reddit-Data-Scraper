The other subject may be any discipline from the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Computer Science.\"\n\nBut its going to take you longer than a single major would.\n\nhttps://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;catalogid=111&amp;chapterid=6947&amp;topicgroupid=30411&amp;loaduseredits=False",

            "comment": "There are options for both double major and combined honours in physics and computer science, as well as if you do a BSc in physics you can minor in computer science. I\u2019m not sure what the options are for minoring if you get a bachelor of computer science (different from BSc).\n\nIf you choose to do a combined honours, you would pick one subject (physics or computer science) as your primary subject and that\u2019s the one you would do your thesis in, and the subject you choose might have extra required courses as part of the honours.\n\nOne thing to note though, scheduling can be pretty tricky as both degrees have a lot of required classes, especially at the 2000 level so I would meet with academic advisors in both departments pretty early to make sure you\u2019re not missing any required classes (happened to me, wouldn\u2019t recommend lol).",

However, you cannot do a combined honours with a bachelor of computer science. \n\nSo if you\u2019re majoring in physics, you can choose CS for half your course load. The primary degree (science) has to be the honours subject. You are not allowed to do honours in CS if you are admitted to the bachelor of science program. \n\nIf you double major, it\u2019ll take 6 or more years to complete whereas a combined honours is the same length of time for 2 specialities.",

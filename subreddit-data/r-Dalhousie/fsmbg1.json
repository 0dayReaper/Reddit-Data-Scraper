    "postText": "A student asked me if it was possible to mute a course, in particular the very active \u201cStudent Support\u201d site launched since the whole COVID-19 episode. It is possible:\n\n1) Log into Brightspace\n2) Click on your account (profile picture if you have one).\n3) Click on Notifications\n4) Scroll down to the bottom\n5) Manage exclusion\n6) Select any courses to mute.\n\nThis is reversible, and my instructions in no way means that this site is not providing a good one-stop shop source of information/resources on campus. If you struggle or need a particular piece of information, this is the place to go.\n\nIn a new life full of online everything, it is best to tune notifications so as not to miss what matters the most to you.",

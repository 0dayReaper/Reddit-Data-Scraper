For example in this picture would the top right start with 1, top left be 2 and would the bottom left be 16 and bottom right be 15?   Would the right hand side face the water?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uadrfoe0zm0b1.png?width=1264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=45aca3095149f7863e1c7eab9c5efcf701771e9c",

Also I didn't know not all the rooms had sinks god I got lucky.",

    "postText": "It's been a cut and dry 50-50 this year with my courses on which profs have had their shit together and made the class well-adapted to the online environment and which have not. But the clearest division between the two is the attitude toward late work. Half of my profs say don't stress no point deduction for one or two days or even at all this year for late work. The others take harsh sentences off every day, and stick to it strictly. And those who do all say well that's the policy, you should've emailed sooner for an extension etc as if it takes no additional mental toll to have to constantly beg and apologize for being behind in a very difficult year for everyone. I recently had a prof ask me to get on a video chat after I let them know I was sick and unable to attend a virtual lab, and they insisted I use the face cam to talk to them about how I had just puked all morning and therefore could not attend the class and surprise surprise they made me attend it anyway saying otherwise the related lab assignment would be an automatic zero. In all fairness they said I could keep the facecam off for the actual lab part and then offered for me to attend an extra help session. All I needed was time just 24-48 hrs to recover before I jumped back into this online hell school from which we all have no escape as it pings on our phones and laptop screens 24 hrs a day even on the supposed 'break week' last week.\n\nAnd sorry I'm using this sub as some kind of venting tool because most of my friends at this school work as TAs or want to go on to become profs and just love love love university, but I DON'T. All I'm saying is it's incredibly demoralizing to have to keep begging for empathy from the faculty and my fellow students who happen to work as TAs. I just wanted to see if there is anyone else feeling like this and say you are not alone",

Chances are I will pass the course but with like a 55. If I got back late work points it would be closer to a 70. Half my points are gone because I joined the class late after add drop and they wouldn\u2019t let me skip the first two assignments, so I\u2019ve been almost a week behind this entire term until the break week. Then of course they made an assignment due the SUNDAY of the break week which I will now be about 3 days late on so another half that grade gets washed away. Prof doesn\u2019t respond she send the TA to do her dirty work telling me no exceptions with late penalties. If the universities really asked profs to be lenient then what the hell is happening in this course",

                                    "comment": "So first off I'll say that the university ***asked*** profs to be lenient, it wasn't a mandate or anything. And also the messaging around being lenient was a lot stronger back in the winter semester when this all started so it actually is possible that your prof doesn't even know that Dal wants them to be lenient.  \n\n\nFirst thing should be to e-mail the prof (keep the paper trail!) and voice your concerns. Sounds like you've already done this and it wasn't helpful. Next thing I would do is send an e-mail to the department chair, NOT the dean. Some tips for e-mailing the chair:\n\n1. Keep your e-mail as short as possible (this actually goes for most e-mail). Short = manageable; Long =  angry chair.\n2. Explain how you've tried communicating with your prof and if you feel the prof is not communicating back.\n3. Don't include the prof on this e-mail. You might not want them knowing it was *you* who e-mailed the chair.\n4. Try and find a few other students who also feel the course policy is unfair. Unfortunately we do get students who make up complaints in attempts to forge their way to a good grade without any work. Having just 3-4 other students you can point to will help you be taken more seriously.\n\nAlso keep in mind that, just like you, all of your profs including department chairs have been under considerable stress this semester in between moving everything online (easily 4 times as much work as in-person teaching) and the negotiations/strike. Not saying this gives profs a pass to do whatever they want, but asking for help is going to get you a lot farther than demanding concessions.\n\nHope this helps, and hang in there!",

How about my prof just wake up tomorrow and remember they are a human being and their students are human beings and magically their heart can grow three times its size that day and they give back all the points they stole hmm?\n\nthanks for trying to be helpful but I already have six assignments to catch up on across five classes on top of having to get involved in an email war between prof TA and dean. For you to hop on this thread I hope you are giving full passes to all your students yourself. For me I'm going to power through and take my 55% and never look back at this shit school again",

This is the most lenient year I\u2019ve ever experienced from most of my professors. \n\nAside from the smaller assignments that usually get deductions of 20-50% per day late, I can\u2019t think of a single course where you would get anything more than 0% if you somehow handed your deliverable in late.  They always use the argument (and they rightly should) that if you submit a project bid or proposal late, why would you submit it at all? Your bid wouldn\u2019t be eligible for competition if you can\u2019t submit it on time. \n\nThis term, I know tons of people who have had major midterms or deliverables moved. Some of my instructors have gone far beyond what I would have expected during all this. I can\u2019t complain there!",

            "comment": "You're definitely not the only person having a tough semester. I'm a first-year student and I'm not used to online school. For myself, I feel like there's so only much I can blame on profs and the TAs. Most of it is just stress and me struggling with time management. Some weeks I manage and do well in my classes, and others I have a hard time getting through. I can't even imagine how older students are doing.  \n\nSome happenings and a few of my screw-ups this semester:\n\n* I missed the deadline for two assignments each worth 10% of my grade. Prof said no late work accepted.\n* I got 40% and 45% on two open-book tests each worth 10% of my grade.\n*  I submitted an assignment at 12 am and missed the deadline by one minute because my laptop keeps lagging. I had points deducted, but luckily the TA took 5% off instead of the 10% they were supposed to. \n* I got 65% on a group project that I basically did myself.  I reached out to my group through every channel I could and only one member regularly responded and actually did the work. I can only do so much when people don't answer their emails.\n* I got 55% on a project. The TA lectured (I would say yelled at tbh) the entire class in an audio clip he send us about how bad our work was, even though the rubric was generic and he didn't tells us what he wanted in the paper and the prof didn't either.  \n\nOn average my grades are good, but I'm so mad at myself for these mess ups because my parents are paying so much money. I have taken college-level classes in the US before and have done well. I just never imagined online school would be this hard. I know it will end though. Hopefully next term profs are more organized and things work themselves out.",

    "postText": "Hello r/Dalhousie! I\u2019m writing because of the recent street party (or whatever you want to call it) that got so much attention from the University, South End neighbours, and the fuzz.\n\nI come with advice! When I was an undergrad at Dal, my roommates (off campus, obvs) and I threw a bunch of massive parties. They were extremely fun, and they were, without question, some of the best times of my life. We threw BBQs, keggers, and got up to all kinds of nonsense. I have stories I\u2019ll remember till I die and made a bunch of awesome friends I still have years later.\n\nWe threw 1-2 major parties a term for 2.5 years in the South End (my old house was in one of the pics of the recent street party! So much nostalgia.) and we did it without causing any of the grief some current students seem to think is a right they receive by paying tuition.\n\nHow? We did it by following the social contract that has existed between Dal, its students, and the South End neighbours that has existed for decades. Dal, students, and neighbors all know undergrads want to have fun and that parties are an important part of the undergrad experience. Its why people go to Dal or Queens or Western or X and not UofT or York. The parties seriously rock. And the locals, for the most part, like the students and enjoy having them around. The students bring energy, youth, excitement, and economic benefits to the city. But the ability for everyone to get along depends in large part on everyone following the social contract. \n\nHere\u2019s the contract: undergrads must acknowledge the parties occur in a space shared with families, follow the law, and be respectful of neighbours. In return, the students are allowed to throw sick ass parties.\n\nHere\u2019s how you (the undergraduates) follow the contract and keep up your end of the bargain:\n\n(1) Tell your neighbors you are having some people over and you will be as respectful as possible, but it might be a bit loud for a few hours, and you'll try to make sure you respect noise bylaws;\n\n(2) stay on private property the entire time;\n\n(3) make an announcement around 10:30 that the party will wrap by 11, and then announce what bar/club the party will move to (we usually hit the Split Crow then Alehouse, but I\u2019m sure times have changed);\n\n(4) start asking people to make their way to the bar/call cabs at 10:50;\n\n(5) make sure the scene is cleared by 11:15 and people are on their way to the agreed upon next stop.\n\nIf you do these simple things you will be able to have lots of fun in a way that is respectful and sustainable.\n\nI\u2019ve seen comments that these massive street gatherings in the middle of the night on public property are the School\u2019s fault. This is insane. If you are blaming Dal admin for your behaviour, you honestly need to grow up and take responsibility for your actions. If you are among those who are trying to blame Dal for your behaviour: I\u2019m embarrassed for you. I really am. And I don't embarrass easily.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen comments that Dalhousie should provide party spaces for its students. This is not only dumb, it\u2019s so so so fucking lame. Honestly. No university-sanctioned safe space party is going to be crazy or lit or whatever adjective undergrads now use to describe good parties. Maybe you could join a social club and get a drink ticket, but that's about it. And that's how it should be! Instead of asking the school to throw you parties (I can't believe I even have to write this...come on people) make some friends with off campus houses for god\u2019s sake! Go to their parties! Make friends at SMU! Go to their parties! (You don't have to worry about the Mount).\n\nAnd if you are desperate for a sweet street party \u2013 take the necessary steps and plan it so it will work for everyone! Contact the union. Get a key person to organize a street festival during a fall Saturday. Contact the city and apply for a permit for a local neighborhood street party. Contact local neighborhood groups and local city councillors and involve key stakeholders in the process and planning. Charge a fee so you can hire police and security and have restrooms and facilities for a couple/few thousand people. Have a cookout or whatever. Might be a way to repair the relationship between students and the South End citizenry. This is what adults do when they want to have a sweet street party in a beautiful neighborhood in a great city. Still no open booze containers though.\n\nWe all want the same thing here \u2013 for everyone to get along, be safe, and have as much fun as possible. But people need to take responsibility for their actions, respect the law, and more importantly, respect those around you. It really isn\u2019t hard, and if you can\u2019t do it, well, you deserve the negative press, legal consequences, scrutiny of your parties, and negative attention from the University.\n\nStay safe out there! And good luck on midterms.\n\nChairsofa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: I'm so fucking jealous. I wish I was an undergrad in the fall again.",

I thought that was genius. Within a few weeks they pretty much had catre blanche within reasonable hours and we did have some rangers there. \n\nA couple of them continued to be close with those families over the years as well, so it worked out for everyone.",

Funnily enough, living in the North End now, I've traded belligerent, obnoxious students for homeless people and drugs addicts, but I'd still take them over the students because at least they mind their own business and don't act like complete fuckwits every weekend.",

As an extremely introverted fourth-year student at King's, I can remember when some HOCO shenanigans used to occur on campus before the pandemic (rez parties despite there being a policy about drinking in rez, yanno, the usual rez life stuff...that I politely avoided when I still lived on campus). I feel like the parties got pushed into the outdoors and the folks who attend just seem to want to outdo last year's catastrophe! As I said, I'm super introverted, so partying is not my personal idea of a good time. However, the advice you give is excellent. The parties you had hosted in the past do sound *truly* great and well-organized! I wish something could actually be done to get the message through to the students, but Dalhousie sending out memos condemning it probably makes some of them even more rebellious and entitled if anything....yanno? Anyways, just wanted to say that I wish Dal would take a page out of your book (for the good advice!) in the future when they send out their yearly memo, because I fear this will just get worse and that's not okay. \ud83d\ude05",

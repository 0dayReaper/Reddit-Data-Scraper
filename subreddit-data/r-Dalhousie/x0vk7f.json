    "postText": "It's your friendly local gay perpetual grad student here. I wish I came with something better to discuss, but let's talk about HIV prevention.\n\nThis province typically has [15 cases on average per year](https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20211201001), but that number went up to 19 in 2019, and NSHA has not yet released numbers for 2020 or 2021, let alone 2022. We've been on an upward trend since about 2004 or so. **I'm here to warn you:** I'm relatively well-connected within the gay community. The view from the ground floor is not good. Many young people in their 20s and 30s have contracted HIV this year, and while antiretroviral treatments exist and are incredibly effective, and U=U (undetectable = untransmissible), prevention is still the preferred way for us to deal with HIV as a community.\n\n[Safer sex](https://www.catie.ca/safer-sex-guide-0) is the first starting point. Understanding the risk of different sex acts, the benefits of condoms, and proper testing schedules all remain very important tools. You can get condoms for free at the Dal Health Clinic, but let's level with one another, if you can afford the cost, other brands of condoms tend to be more comfortable to use.\n\nPrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a single pill containing two drugs (Emtricitabine and Tenofovir) that block the virus and very significantly reduces the odds of contracting HIV. If you are able to get on it, it is the closest to a medical miracle that we have (and if you're interested in the clinical evidence, I suggest you look into the PARTNER and PARTNER2 studies).\n\nHere's what you need to know about PrEP access at Dalhousie and in Nova Scotia:\n\n* Getting on PrEP requires a prescription from a doctor, and blood tests for liver levels and HIV status every three months, with prescriptions given out 3 months at a time\n* Online clinics like Freddie **do not** operate in Nova Scotia, because the province does not allow most online healthcare services to requisition blood work, so you **must** find a local doctor\n* The Dalhousie Health Clinic prescribes PrEP, as does the [Halifax Sexual Health Centre](https://hshc.ca/), and will get you the requisitions you need for bloodwork\n* Demand generic PrEP instead of namebrand (Gilead) and this will significantly reduce cost\n* **Cost is $250/month**\n* The DSU-negotiated student health plan (for grads, undergrads, and international students alike) from Blue Cross Medavie considers PrEP a \"high-cost drug\" with a $1000 cap.\n* This means **after 4 months your coverage is exhausted and you will be out of pocket $250/month**\n* It is only $250/month if you fill your prescription with the \"preferred online pharmacy\", which it *says* online is Direct2U, but for some reason my prescription went to Telus Health and is managed through that app?\n* As far as I am aware, there are no other subsidies available for PrEP for students in Nova Scotia, whether from the province, school, or the drug manufacturer\n\nTesting is also important but can be difficult to access. Dalhousie Health Clinic can run all STI tests for you, but blood collection is done centrally and booked independently through NSHA. So you will book an appointment with Dal Health for the requisition, they will likely give you anal and throat swabs as appropriate on-site, and then you will leave with a blood requisition form and [book online](https://booking.nshealth.ca/qmaticwebbooking/) a separate blood appointment. It can be two-three weeks to get a Dal clinic appointment, and then another two to get a blood collection appointment. However, if you book the soonest appointment, you can check regularly and often move your appointment closer if you are anxious by using the rebooking link in the confirmation email they send you.\n\nIf you have the resources, instant HIV tests are available for [purchase in Canada from Insti](https://www.insti.com/hiv-self-test/) at $55+tax/shipping for two tests. I've known these to have been reliable when confirmed with PCR in both negative and positive cases, unfortunately. Occasionally a local group will have some to give out for free, so try calling the Halifax Sexual Health Centre to see if any are available anywhere.\n\nPlease, share with your friends who may be at risk. University is a hard enough journey without having to deal with learning to live with HIV. It comes with its own grief cycle and a second coming-out, and I can't watch more friends go through this.\n\nBe safe out there, and support your queer friends by speaking up when you see pragmatic warnings like this generating hateful responses. There's an incredible amount of anti-LGBTQ hate building up in online communities and we need to slow down its impacts on the real world.",

Checking the FAQ now, it says that they can do coordination of benefits with a private plan. This could save me hundreds of dollars and give me a bunch of breathing room if I get accepted to it. I'll definitely be sure to spread the word if this works to get more students access to PrEP.\n\nI'm also going to reach out to BlueCross Medavie and see if that $1000 cap can't be overridden by physician somehow. Sometimes they have sneaky extra forms for that stuff.",

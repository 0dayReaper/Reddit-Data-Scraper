You *can* take these courses as an undergrad student. \n\nThe reason you're restricted from taking LAWS1008 is that it's (1) a mandatory course for all law students, and so they need to reserve all spaces in the course for law students... and (2) the content of the course is relevant for future legal practice, and so a non-law student taking it would be a waste of time.",

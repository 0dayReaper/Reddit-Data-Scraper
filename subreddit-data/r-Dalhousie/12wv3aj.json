    "postText": "Hey, r/Dalhousie!\n\nI have a question for you all regarding single rooms at Dal. I applied for single rooms in Glengary (bachelor), Risley, Shirreff, and Gerard. I left out Howe and Mini Res cause they don\u2019t seem like they\u2019re for me.\n\nPlease let me know anything you would want a first year student to know about these options. I am really curious about those bachelor pads in the Glengary apartments, and Risley Hall. Are they loud? Are they dirty? Please, spill the beans.\n\nWhen I was talking with the residence office, the lady said that they will guarantee* a single room if I put it as my top priority, which I did.\n\nAm I in for a sleepless first year?",

It depends what you want- if youre going for the typical university first year dorm experience stick to the main residences.\n\nRisley is good, I found the rooms clean and its quiet on any floor but 1 and 2. I lived on a party floor and it was quiet by 1:30 on weekends, and never loud on weeknights.\n\nGerard is not a good choice for first years. Almost all first year eng classes are on Studley campus. If you arent an engineering major at all its just not a good choice as its 15 min bus ride from main campus and you\u2019ll miss out on a lot more social aspects.\n\nWhen I was in residence, a guy I knew got too many write-ups and he was banished to gerard Lol",

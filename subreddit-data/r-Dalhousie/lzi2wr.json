Both get 50% of their funding from the province. UofA gets another 32% from non-tuition sources (federal funding, donations, the endowment, sales of services and products) while for Dal it's only 10%. UofA's tuition covers 18% of it's costs, while Dal's covers 41%, and so our tuition is higher.\n\nEdit: For comparison, [LMU Munich gets 96%](https://www.lmu.de/en/about-lmu/lmu-at-a-glance/facts-and-figures/budget/index.html) of its funding from the government. German university students pay no tuition. That's how you fund a university.",

This is over $1500 more than McGill which the next highest. \n\nDalhousie also pays graduate students way less to TA (half the amount TAs make in Ontario), has lower minimum stipends (which the university doesn't pay for, these are paid by supervisors using research grants), all while Halifax cost of living is steadily increasing (now on par with most cities in Ontario that have universities, other than Toronto).",

There are bursaries for students from NS to help with the high cost of tuition, but if moving costs plus tuition are more than tuition at dal, they\u2019ll be able to keep Atlantic students. They don\u2019t have to make it cheap just because you want to go to school in Atlantic Canada. If fewer people went from out of province because of more cost affective options, they would either have to reduce tuition or dissolve. In our society university is a business first and foremost, you have to treat it that way to make it work for you. \n\nBtw I\u2019m a student from NS who went to Dal because they gave me a scholarship that made it the most cost effective option, I did my research and didn\u2019t just go to a school arbitrarily and then complain that tuition was too high even though I knew what the cost was going in",

I\u2019m not sure if Dal publishes the breakdown but I think most people attending Dal are from NS and surroundings. Leaving Dal and looking elsewhere shouldn\u2019t be a good thing as Dal is a very big part of professional growth opportunities for NS and the Atlantic provinces as whole. If Dal grows, improves and provides excellent education, the province grows with it. It pains me to see Dal slip through rankings, increasing tuition etc. \n\nI\u2019m primarily speaking from engineering department(mechanical specifically), it has gradually fallen through in terms of how it\u2019s run and overall quality has diminished and hence other U15 and reputable universities(McMaster etc) has surpassed Dal. I think Dal and the province as a whole really needs to address this and also provide real growth opportunities for new graduates. There\u2019s sort of a brain drain going on where people graduate from Dal(I know so many people) and then leave the province because there just is such a lack of opportunities available. We can\u2019t let Dal fail because quite literally it\u2019s representing and putting NS and the Atlantic provinces on the world stage. The university really needs to acknowledge and improve because for the past 3-4 years, all I\u2019ve been seeing is tuition increases year after year but yet the quality of education and experience as a whole is diminishing. It\u2019s really starting to get frustrating and looking like Dal is just milking us for every last dollar they can get while not truly improving in any meaningful manner",

Your evidence certainly doesn\u2019t say a significant number of students are from the HRM, that\u2019s anecdotal. \n\nThe cost of moving doesn\u2019t increase that much with distance if you already have to move, driving the extra 10 hours to Toronto vs Moncton doesn\u2019t change the price of the move that much. \n\nThe cost of living in most of the cities that house \u201cthe big boys\u201d is significantly higher than Halifax so lower tuition doesn\u2019t mean much. \n\nUndergrad education, especially in engineering, is largely the same quality across Canada and no one cares where you went to school outside of academia so you don\u2019t even have to go to one of \u201cthe big boys\u201d as implied by OP. \n\nI\u2019m all for lower tuition fees but if your argument stems from Dal being over priced for the quality of education you\u2019re getting there are more substantial things you can do than post about it on Reddit. The first is switch universities. \n\nDal is like the corner store near your house. They have the same product as the big box store down the road, but charge more for the \u201cconvenience\u201d. \n\nI invite OP to go live in Vancouver or Toronto to get a degree and see if they end up saving money compared to living in Halifax",

But factor in how much people out there get paid as opposed to those that live in Nova Scotia - there's a reason many people went out west for the oil boon. \n\nThe point of my post isn't to say dal is the only flawed institute in Canada, but instead to say that when you are being charged the amount that we are (my major is engineering for example), dal doesn't carry the prestige of other places like McGill or Waterloo. Yes those places are more expensive, but they have better industry connection since they are closer to the heavy hitters in central Canada. If Dal didn't have the local Atlantic market cornered on many of these programs, there is no way they would be charging as much (this would be adjusted for locality as stuff generally costs more in central Canada).",

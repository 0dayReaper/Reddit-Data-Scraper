    "postText": "Hello, I'm a student living in NB(Fredericton) currently. I have gotten many acceptances from ON universities and other places but I'm deciding to stay in Atlantic Canada for my undergrad. Im deciding between Bsc in Dalhousie vs UNB . I have heard that its easier to get better marks at UNB nad its harder to get a high GPA at Dal. Do you guys have any thoughts? I'm aiming for a 3.9+/4.0. I have already gotten 20k scholarship from Dal, unfortunately I didn't get any scholarships from University of Newbrunswick ( where I'm located) because I applied very late and the applications were closed. However, think if I stay at home I could save more money in comparison to going to NS for 3-4 years.  What do you guys think? Do you know anyone currently with 3.9+ GPA from Dal that I could talk to?\nPlease note that I'm an AP student and my GPA in high school is 4.0",

However UNB might still give me scholarships for my second,third year based on how well I'd do. I was actually asking this question because by staying in my province (NB) I would save a lot of money which is also an important thing to consider. I know uni is hard in general but I have hear that you could get easier marks at UNB due to the school being small and better profs/easier assessment. Are u a premed btw?",

I would honestly recommend taking another major program because you can diversify your courses more, it might be a bit less stressful so it would be easier to do well in courses and participate in extracurriculars/volunteer work to diversify your \u201cportfolio\u201d for med school. Consider it (as someone who wanted to do pre-med and opted for a double major in biochem and microbiology instead, I still think I\u2019m less stressed than I would have been in pre-med \ud83d\ude05)\n\nEdit: you don\u2019t need pre-med for med school and it doesn\u2019t really increase your chances of getting into medical school at all, just kind of closes off many other career options. You can get into med school with any undergraduate degree as long as you have their entrance requirements - the rest is up to interviews etc. I have wanted to be a doctor since I could talk, and I NEVER considered that I wouldn\u2019t want to go to medical school but here I am, 4 years into my degree (with one more to go since I did co-op) and I absolutely hate the idea of med school lol. And so grateful I chose something other than pre-med so I didn\u2019t have to change programs and start over.",

Also, I think you misunderstood my comment about competition, I said it because sometimes students compete with each other and might get a bit cock, for example, this year i had a friend that never helped anyone just to get higher marks in a certain course. He didn't even participate in our study groups.  I didn't mean academic competition but more like mental competition because you know a person who is on the same path as you might think that you might fill his seat for medschool,etc.",

So yes it\u2019s doable - the key is to really just master your study habits and don\u2019t just waste time \u2018studying\u2019 if you\u2019re not actually taking anything in - this will just drain you. It\u2019s better to study less and take in more than it is studying for the sake of studying because this will just make you burn out quickly. \n\nA scholarship is great and all (congrats on getting 20k for Dal!) however I need to echo what a lot of other people here are saying - the housing market is a crap shoot so if you can stay at home and go to UNB I would do that if I were you. Like you said, it would be cheaper for you in the long run. Not to mention, undergrad degrees are pretty standard at any university in Canada - so prestige wise they\u2019d be near identical regardless of where you go (it\u2019s really only masters, PhD, and certain specialty programs that differ between university - a BSc is pretty standard wherever you go in Canada). The one tip I can give though is don\u2019t do medsci - it gives you no actual benefit getting into medschool over any other science degree - it\u2019s better to do a BSc specializing in a certain major - this will be WAY more versatile",

GPA is 15 points out of 100 on the Dal med app (former grad, former interviewer, former selection committee). Eventually, you need to succeed in hard courses and not pick the potential easier option. Pick the one that leads you closer to the end goal, then do the work.",

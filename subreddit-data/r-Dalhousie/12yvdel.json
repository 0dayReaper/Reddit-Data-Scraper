There is no meal hall there so you do have to walk at least across the street to get to risley which sucks in the winter and sometimes it\u2019s full so you have to either wait or go further \n2. It is a lot harder to meet new people there\nBut overall I had a good experience there",

If you want something more quiet and laid back try the Mini Res and LeMarchant Place. \n\nDon\u2019t do any double bedrooms in Howe Hall because those are the two shitty dorms. You want Fountain or Bronson and Smith. Risley is likely the most happening location and newest, then Howe if you\u2019re really wanting to let loose in that order. Sheriff is more out of the way so it\u2019s a bit less hectic, but it still has a good social community.",

I would take full advantage of that; you'll make lots of friends from all over. I stayed in Risley Hall and loved it. \n\nThe profs in the CS department at Dalhousie are great. Get to know them! Use office hours. Use the learning centre in your free time. The new dalplex is mint; during my tenure we pay'd a nice levvy for that gym! So enjoy :) \n\nThe city is chill. It has a great drinking culture, food scene, mountain biking &amp; hiking is great, Download the app Alltrails to help find hiking trails and biking spots.   \n\nEnjoy! Congrats on your acceptance.",

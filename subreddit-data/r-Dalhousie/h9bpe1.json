    "postText": "**Are you an incoming student who wants suggestions on what electives to take?** This is a frequently asked topic, so in this thread I aim to bring together as much information as possible from previous threads.\n\n**Are you a current student?** You might find some of this information helpful, but also: ***This is currently a work in progress.*** If you have any suggestions for courses to add, what you liked about them, or general advice, feel free to comment and I can add it to this post. At the moment I only have fall/winter courses listed - summer course suggestions welcome.\n\n***Computer Science elective threads are common*. I know nothing about what's good in that department. Please make suggestions and I can throw them on here.**\n\n**Pro Tip:** Many faculties at Dal recommend (and I concur) that *you should take your writing requirements and social sciences in first year*, especially if you're in a science program, because many of the writing-heavy courses have several tedious assignments and you won't want those taking up too much of your time in later years when you have harder courses to focus on. Aside from that, the skills you pick up from some writing courses will almost certainly help you for the remainder of your time here. It's also totally okay to take these courses in the summer if you want a reduced term course load for your first semester or year. For example, I took only three courses my first ever semester here and diferred the 6 credits of English courses to the following summer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlways consult the [**Dalhousie Academic Timetable**](https://dalonline.dal.ca/PROD/fysktime.P_DisplaySchedule) to see useful information about courses such as times of synchronous content, available seating, and whether the course is even offered this year.\n\nNOTE: *Some of these courses are cross-listed. Cross listed courses are the same course but with a different code - sometimes these codes are listed at a different level (2000 vs 3000). Some of these courses may not be listed for the current academic year, may no longer exist, or may have changed dramatically. Courses may be restricted to certain programs, majors, have prerequisites, or require completion of a certain number of credit hours. Check your degree requirements to see what you need - also, it is possible to \"max out\" your lower level credit hours.*\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Commonly Suggested Electives:**\n\n[**ANAT 1010**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=ANAT+1010) *Basic Human Anatomy*. The in-person and online versions of this course follow each other exactly. All exams were all online and essentially open book; it's not too hard. This course is required for nursing students and may be required for entry to some health professions. [**ANAT 1020**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=ANAT+1020) is the same course but restricted to kinesiology, health promotion, and certain health sciences. DEHY 2851 is the same but for dental hygiene students.\n\n[**HPRO 4412 / GWST 2412**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=HPRO+4412)   *Human Sexuality*. This is the pumpkin spice latte of 3rd/4th year electives at Dal. Almost everyone does it, and most people say it's pretty interesting, fun, and easy as long as you keep up with it.  \n\n[**MUSC 2019**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=MUSC+2019)  *Rock 'n' Roll Era &amp; Beyond*. AKA, the \"History of Rock Music\" by pretty much everyone.\n\n[**MUSC 2020**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=MUSC+2020)  *The History of Jazz*  \n\n[**MUSC 2024**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=MUSC+2024) and [**2025**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=MUSC+2025)  *Guitar: History and Techniques I &amp; II*. AKA, probably the easiest A/A+ you'll ever find, even if you have no musical ability whatsoever. The instructors are really chill.  \n\n[**PSYO 1011**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=PSYO+1011) and [**1012**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=PSYO+1012) *Intro to Psychology &amp; Neuroscience I* *&amp; II*. Don't let the neuroscience tag fool you. It's reportedly easier and interesting.\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Less Common Suggestions:**\n\n[**MGMT 1601**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=MGMT+1601)  *Electronic Information Management*. \"Pretty easy if you know how to use PowerPoint, teaches basics on Excel and html.\" *-* u/bellab001  \n\n**PHIL 2081**  *Ethics in the World of Business*. **(Not listed in 2020/2021)** \"Online course, the final is based on questions from previous quizzes, take notes and you\u2019ll be fine. I got an A just from doing the practice quizzes til I basically had the course material memorized.\" *-* u/bellab001  \n\n[**PHIL 2260**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=PHIL+2260) *Philosophy of Art*. See u/UCphoto's comment below for more info.\n\n[**MUSC 2354**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=MUSC+2354)  *History of Western Music to 1750*  \n\n[**MUSC 2355**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=MUSC+2355)  *History West Music 1750 to Present*  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Common Writing Requirements:**\n\n[**ENGL 1040**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=ENGL+1040)  *Pop Culture*. Fun and easy. Must be taken with another 1000 level ENGL course.  \n\n[**ENGL 1050**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=ENGL+1050) *Pulp Fiction*. Must be taken with another 1000 level ENGL course.  \n\n[**ENGL 1100**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=ENGL+1100)  *Writing for University*. This course can help improve your English writing skills, whether it's for academic or creative writing. I personally recommend taking this one with one of the two above - while it's a little more work, the information and skills gained are very useful.  \n\n[**SCIE 1111**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=SCIE+1111)  *Writing for the Sciences*. This course satisfies the writing requirement for science students only, but covers the skills necessary to write academic papers in the context of scientific research. **Warning. People either love or really hate this course - it's not always an easy option and is reputedly somewhat unforgiving. Nevertheless it's there and the training has some value.**\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CompSci Electives:**\n\n[**CSCI 3154**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;topicgroupid=19607&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=CSCI+3154)  *Intro to Artificial Intelligence with Gaming Applications*. **(Not listed for 2020/2021)** See u/UCPhoto's comment below for more info.\n\n[**CSCI 4145**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=CSCI+4145)  *Cloud Computing*. See u/UCPhoto's comment below for more info.\n\n[**CSCI/MATH 4116**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;topicgroupid=29364&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=MATH+4116)  *Cryptography*. See u/UCPhoto's comment below for more info.\n\n*(More coming soon. Suggestions welcome.)*\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Single-Term, 6 Credit Hour Courses that Satisfy Writing or Social Sciences:**\n\n[**SUST 1000**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=SUST+1000)  *What is Sustainability?* (6 Credit Hours, can be used as a writing requirement *or* as a social science, but not both at the same time).  \n\n[**SUST 1001**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=SUST+1001)  *A Sustainable Future*. (6 Credit Hours, can be used as a social science only).  \n\n[**ENGL/CWCR 1030**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=CRWR+1030)  *Reading and Writing Stories.* (6 Credit Hours, can be used as a writing requirement only).\n\nNOTE: *6 Credit Hours in one term means that you could take only four courses, with one of the above being one of them, and your total credit hours for the term would still add up to 15. \\[(3x3)+(1x6) vs. 3x5\\]. It is extra work for one course, but less work overall compared to two separate courses.*\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rarities and Hidden Gems:**\n\n[**HSTC 3415**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=HSTC+3415)  *Brewing Civilization: the History, Culture, and Science of Beer.* It's awesome. This is a King's course but most of my classmates were Dal students from every discipline.\n\n[**BIOL/PLAN/ENVS 3225**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=BIOL+3225)  *Plants in the Human Landscape*. Has BIOL 1010 as a prerequisite but this course is super chill. It's cross listed in planning and environmental science.\n\n[**BIOL 3601**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=BIOL+3601)  *Nature Conservation*. Same instructor and format as  BIOL 3225. Also requires BIOL 1010.  \n\n[**PHYC/ENVS 2310**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=PHYC+2310) *Energy and the Environment.* \"It's essentially Renewable Energy 101. Some basic (non-calc) math involved, but is a lot of fun.\" - u/DISP-er  \n\n[**PHYC/OCEA/GEOG 2800**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=PHYC+2800) *Climate Change.* \"It's essentially 'why global warming happens 101'. Yes it's listed as a physics course, but there's 0 math involved whatsoever.\" - u/DISP-er  \n\n[**BMNG 3000**](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=BMNG+3000) *Technology in Medicine.* \"Slightly more work then two courses above, seeing it's a 3000 level course. Pre-reqs are all first year courses, so no reason you couldn't take it in 2nd year. Gives a good overview of all the domains where physical science, technology and engineering are applied in the medical field.\" - u/DISP-er   Course is intended for MedSci and open to science (and I assume engineering) students. It requires first year physics, chemistry, and calculus.\n\nOn the Academic Timetable, generally speaking, King's College courses of interest can be found under **Early Modern Studies** and **Hist of Science &amp; Technology**. There are many popular options in either of these categories aside from those listed here. Some of these will be cross-listed in **Contemporary Studies**, **History**, and/or **Religious Studies**.\n\nOn the Academic Timetable, courses listed under **Classics** generally deal with mythology, Mediterranean history, ancient religions, and even introductory Latin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Language Courses:**\n\n(Will add later.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Some of the above suggestions have shamelessly stolen from the following threads:*\n\n[Source 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dalhousie/comments/ghxgxr/electives/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), (will add more as I consolidate. I can't be bothered right now.)\n\nI'll look over the readability of all of the above later and fix it if it's crappy. This is a start. EDIT: Just checked it on my phone. Updated slightly. Will fix more later.\n\nUpdate 1: Added generalization about King's courses (EMSP, HSTC), Classics, and some other suggestions from comments.",

In one psyo class I was graded down an entire point out of like 20 for a space mark you couldn't even see unless you highlighted everything. Maybe its a normal thing to be graded down for maybe not, but to this day I avoid classes that allow TA's to have so much control over your grades, regardless if you do perfect in the prof lecture graded components. edit: seems like reddit automatically removes the spaces but you get the idea.

            "comment": "Great post, thanks for compiling this. Here are a few electives I've enjoyed during my CS degree, if it helps anyone.\n\nPHIL 2260, philosophy of art is a pretty fun course if you're interested in discussing what makes art art. When I took it evaluation was purely based on 4 essays plus participation in online discussions (just commenting on Brightspace, super easy to get the participation marks), so it's not too stressful. Like most courses based on subjective evaluations it's very hard to get an A+ (but doable), but also very hard to do badly. \n\nCSCI 3154, Intro to Artificial Intelligence with Gaming Applications is a really interesting course which is much more focused than most CS courses about AI and ML. Instead of the drudgery of yet more making plots in Jupyter Notebooks you actually get to focus on a narrow subset of machine learning, get a good understanding of the theory behind it, and then do a group project that uses machine learning to train an agent to play a level in Doom. It's challenging, but in my opinion it's a much better approach to an AI course than 3151, 4155, or 4146.\n\nCSCI 4145, Cloud Computing, is a course I'm in the process of taking, and so far it's really enjoyable. The assignments so far have used an incremental process to get you familiar with NodeJS, deployment to AWS, and deployment to Azure. The idea of having frequent small assignments that build on each other is fantastic, as you never feel overwhelmed and you still get experience with useful skills in web development. There are a couple group assignments at the end as well as a midterm and exam which I've not done yet, so not sure how that will go, but so far I think it's a really well designed course with a curriculum that's useful to anyone looking to go into web development.\n\nCSCI 4116, Cryptography probably needs no introduction as it's quite famous among CS students, but I'll mention it anyway. It's an interesting course that gives a nice introduction to cryptographic principles, and though it is fairly easy it doesn't feel like a waste of time.",

I am determined to pursue dental school after completing my degree. Could you please suggest to me which one of the two programs will be beneficial and help me fulfill all the credits required for the dental school? I also had a meeting with Ms. Heidi Tracey, the Health Promotion advisor, we were trying to create a schedule to fulfill the requirements but found that I would have to take an extra three courses apart from my degree which would add an extra cost to my education. She suggested I go for an Arts degree to complete the prerequisites. Also, I had a chat with the faculty of dentistry. They provided me with a list of courses to be undertaken with required credit hours but they also mentioned that there is no specific program needed to join dental school  I would be interested in becoming a psychologist or a health administrator. I am confused about which of the two will be the more lucrative option and will help me lead better to a dental degree if possible. I would have switched to BSc but I did not study Mathematics in class 12.  I feel quite disoriented and can not make up my mind about where to start and which program to opt for.\u00a0Any clue or suggestions will be helpful. \r  \n\r  \nThank you for reading a long rant :)\n\nAlso, apologies for writing here, could not post in the post section due to some error errrr",

I hope your semester is going good so far and you were able to make a good decision based on your needs.\n\nFirst year physics can be difficult no matter which you take, as it's not only very mathematical but also relies heavily on problem solving and interpreting diagrams. Personally I would likely have decided not to take physics if I did not need to. That said, some people have the mind for it, so go for it if you find it fun!\n\nIf you are in the life sciences and need physics (such as for xray tech / chemistry / medsci) then take PHYC 1310/1320 because it's considered the \"easier\" option. If you're in the physical sciences such as engineering or geology, you basically need to take PHYC 1190/1290 (\"Engineering Physics\"). Eng physics will usually satisfy the requirements for any courses needing 1310 as a prereq, but it doesn't always go the other way.\n\nIn either case: These. Are. Not. Bird. Courses.",

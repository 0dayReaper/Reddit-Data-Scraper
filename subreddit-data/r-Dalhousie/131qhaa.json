    "postText": "Hello everyone. I am a student who is looking for a place to live in Halifax. I have found a place that I really like, but due to some personal reasons, I have not been able to go tour it yet. I have seen the house on a video call, however, I'll still go and visit it as soon as I can. Before I decide to fully move in and sign a lease, I want to make sure I won't be faced with problems that I missed on because I didn't check it beforehand. My question here for you all is what are the things that I should be looking for? What should I ask the tenants/house owner? What are some things that I should look out for when signing the lease/moving in? I would appreciate any kind of help and opinion I can get.",

There\u2019s really no room to be picky with places in the city. If you get an opportunity to sign a lease, do it. Last thing you want is for august to roll around and you aren\u2019t able to find a place to live because something threw you off in April",

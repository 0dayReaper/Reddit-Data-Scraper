I\u2019m a little worried since I might not be able to find a web development co-op since I heard it could get pretty competitive. Do you guys have any advice?I\u2019m thinking of building several websites this summer so it looks good on my resume.",

            "comment": "Starting to build websites is great. Try to create a good portfolio showing the different projects you worked on. If you do co-op, there is usually a few nod offers on MyCareer when the co-op placement starts. Also, talk to other students who did co-op before. Talk to professors. Right down a list of businesses you might want to work for. \n\nLike any other job search, it\u2019s all about how you prepare for it and who you talk to. Knowing people is how you get access to jobs that are not advertised.",

            "comment": "A lot of the times some job postings just have the plain old software developer intern or software engineer intern and you either get stuck with doing backend work or front end or sometimes even full stack work(which is both front and backend). With these you don\u2019t really know either way until your start date because most times a company just has you list your preference within their job app.\n\nAs it pertains to competitiveness, that\u2019s every job market no matter what industry, you just have to be lucky enough to see if they like your resume or you network with them really well.\n\nI would suggest you spend some of your free time learning how web dev works and especially full stack because if you can demonstrate that understand front and back end you have a slightly very slightly higher chance of being better than someone who is skewed to either end. Learn how frameworks work such as angular, react, vue (all js frameworks btw) then learn about APIs if you can make your own the better etc, php even but just dip your toes in and around them and it doesn\u2019t always have to be a website it can be whatever you want it to be.",

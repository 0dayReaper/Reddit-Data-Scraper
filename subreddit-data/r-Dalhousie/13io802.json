    "postText": "I am an Ontario highschool student who applied to dalhousie in early january for the management program and today is the deadline and I still haven\u2019t heard back. I was just wondering if anyone knows if I can still be accepted past this date as there was an error collecting my grades and the admission office didn\u2019t have ANY of my grade 12 grades till May 4th\u2026 or maybe they just don\u2019t want me as I have a 79% average which I don\u2019t think is too low for the management program. Any answers would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

This was like literally a week and a half ago they told me that they had trouble processing tons of Ontario students OUAC so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much if you can get an appointment. I had the same issue with \u201cwritten response to follow\u201d or whatever on my dal online for months.",

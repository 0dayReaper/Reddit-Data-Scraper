I haven\u2019t heard if anyone is doing this tomorrow at Dal though.\n\nI\u2019m curious if any grad students plan to walk out or if there is a larger plan from DAGS or something that I\u2019ve missed. Anyone have any info?",

            "comment": "Tri-council funding hasn't increased in 20 years while inflation has gone up 50%. The walkouts are to demand an increase in federal funding for Tri-council graduate and postdoctoral scholarships. These scholarships tend to set the bar for graduate student funding, so an increase in Tri-council stipend amounts would likely lead to increases for all grad students in Canada. For example, Dalhousie caps university managed awards (Tri-council funding, Killam Predoctoral scholarships, Nova Scotia graduate scholarship) at $30,000 per year per student, with the exception that if you receive a single award worth more than that (ex. a CGS-D Tri-council award) you get to keep the full amount.",

Of course all that means is that no one has offered to organize. You can still walkout to the quad in front of Henry Hicks at noon. That would be the obvious time and place.",

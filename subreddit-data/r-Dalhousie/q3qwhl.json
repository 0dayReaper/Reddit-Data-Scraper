Appointments often fill up instantly, making working out regularly almost impossible\n5. As dal students, we can't even opt-out of the membership, essentially forcing us to pay for a service we can barely use\n\nIs it just me that finds this situation ridiculous? No other gyms are managed this badly, the only reason they're getting away with it is because were forced to pay for this service. I don't appreciate being hustled like that, is there anything we can do?\n\n(Not even mentioning the ridiculous walk around the building were forced to do when exiting the facility just to end up in the same hallway as everyone else)",

Appointments have been a thing since the winter semester and they were also booked in less than 2 minutes most of the time. With more people back on campus, it\u2019s not a surprise. Unfortunately there is nothing you can do about it other than refreshing every 2 seconds just before the timing you want 3 days before when the booking open. It is part or your semester fees, same as the bus pass and courses stuff. \nHopefully this will end soon because you\u2019re not the only one annoyed about it",

Many people contract viruses without symptoms and are immune without the requirement of vaccines. Even if you're vaccinated there is no guarantee that you won't contract the virus and pass it on to others. The only way to be sure your not infected and a carrier is to be tested. Testing is non-invasive and preferable to having drugs pumped into your system that cause reactions from their chemical ingredients. Being forced to get a vaccine does not protect others who are susceptible. Being forced to get a vaccine you dont need is a definite infringment on your freedom of choice. \nWhat's next, are you going to abolish abortions to rape victims as well because condoms and birth control drugs are available?

Immaturity is the shortcoming of authority to force opinion on others without supporting evidence. The evidence of Covid compared to previous outbreaks and pandemics does not support the draconian methods of removing peoples freedom of choice and mobility. These methods only reduce the responsibility of authority given by the whole and infringements on public freedoms should only be practiced when there are no other options to protecting the public. \nCost is not a factor, authority has access to unlimited resources regardless of cost and non-invasive methods of testing are much better at controling the spread of viral infections than vaccines or natural immunity. The immune can still be infected and a carrier of the virus. Viruses are the answer to those who require them but, \"foce put is a poor man's choice!\" Our rights are more important than the lazy ignorance and frugalality of authorities!\nElected authorities are weak and ineffective in imposing on peoples charter rights to life and liberty without just cause. People die but, more will die due to loss of opportunity to thrive and evolve.\nFear and ignorance rules the day during pandemics.

Governments should mandate distribution of vaccines to third world countries in an effort to reduce mutations. The greedy only concentrate on profit, not disease control. \n\nEven the delta mutation has a less than 1% mortality rate for those who have been reported to be infected and there are probably more who have been infected that were not reported or detected. Many who have few to no symptoms and do not go to a doctor go unreported.\n\nTo date, there have been 4.5 million recorded deaths due to Covid in a global population of 7.8 billon people. There were 50 million deaths attributed to the 1918 pandemic in a global population of 2 billion. SARS had a much higher death rate than Covid but thankfully, was not as transmittable. Forcing people to be vaccinated is an overreach. Over 6,000 people in the US alone have died from complications after receiving the vaccine. \n\nTesting is the \"only\" safeguard from spreading the virus publicly. Lock downs are not overly effective due to lifestyles and taking vaccinations are unacceptable to many even in some religions. The rights of citizens should be paramount unless the consequences outweigh the risks and Covid has not increased the annual global death rate of previous years. \n\nThere are acceptable rapid antigen tests that can detect Covid infection as well as PCR testing and should be implemented for all public transit carriers and public venues. These tests are noninvasive and pose NO threat to the individual. The only thing preventing testing is cost and government incompetence. Cost is of little consequence when people are dying and the economy is tanking due to government lockdowns and incompetence.\n\nVaccines are meant for those who do not have a healthy immune system and have difficulty buliding antibodies against viral infections. Even those vaccinated can come in contact with the virus and be reinfected. Their antibodies will protect them from severe illness and death but they are still capable of contracting and spreading the virus. Covid has been found in wild animals and farm animals as well.\n\nThere is little risk to most in taking the vaccine and it does protect a lot of people who need it but, people should have the right of choice, especially for invasive procedures such as vaccines. It is their right to choose if it's not effecting others adversely and you cannot spread something you don't have otherwise, we would all be rich or, dead!\nIt is criminal to punish people when they've done nothing wrong and are naturally immune to viral infections.",

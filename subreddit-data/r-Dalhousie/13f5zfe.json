They'll also be able to alert you to charges which may not have been posted yet, like certain lab fees which may change based on the number of people enrolled.",

Just to be sure wait for student account to get back to but I would watch out for the fee deadline for your courses. If they are coming up soon I would recommend paying that balance just to be safe,  as even if it is not used rn, it will just go towards the next semester.",

I may not have been clear in my writing on a second read but what I meant is that if they don't have the sign present, it means they have to pay the balance amount. Since OP doesn't have the symbol for the current term, they will have to pay the 140.50. I did the calculation and the electronic transfer they did is 140.50 short for the amount owed.",

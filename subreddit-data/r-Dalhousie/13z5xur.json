    "postText": "As an incoming international student at Dal, I'm enrolled in the Master of Engineering program in Industrial Engineering. I'm seeking recommendations for courses to take in the upcoming Fall and Winter terms of 2023/24. While I have already done some research on the available courses, I still lack confidence in my choices.\n\nComing from a background in mechanical engineering, It's a bit overwhelming to sift through all the options, especially since I am also allowed to pick few undergraduate courses. It's crucial for me to avoid selecting courses that have extensive prerequisites in industrial engineering, as I don't want to struggle or receive a lower grade.\n\nMy areas of interest include supply chain management, manufacturing, product management, quality assurance, process optimizations, and data analytics. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or advice from seniors/students of this program and can share their experiences regarding the coursework choices they made.",

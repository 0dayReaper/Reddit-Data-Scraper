    "postText": "I'm planning to roam around Vancouver in July for about a week or less, I wanted a place I could stay at for cheap. I was wondering which universities in Vancouver let visitors stay like dal does, I know UBC and SFU have places for about 70 bucks a night, but I'm trying to find a place cheaper than that(Since I just need a place to keep my luggage and sleep).\n\nCould you please tell me any such uni or other places you might be aware of that accommodate visitors for cheap?\n\nI'm also looking for flights from Halifax to Vancouver during the first week of July, Air Canada has flights for around 320 CAD. Since I'm an international student, I have no idea if that's too expensive or reasonable. I'd also appreciate tips to save money on flights.\n\nThank you!",

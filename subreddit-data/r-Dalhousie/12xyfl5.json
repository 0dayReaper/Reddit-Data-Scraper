My GPA was around the same in my first year (got a D in an environmental sciences course.. ouch!), and now I\u2019m Faculty in CS! Once you get used to the university life, you can pull it up. If you\u2019re looking at grad school or future employment jobs, they focus more on the last year/last two years of your degree. You\u2019re doing well :)",

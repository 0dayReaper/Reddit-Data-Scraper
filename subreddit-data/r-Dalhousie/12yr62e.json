            "comment": "The first year workload depends entirely on your goals, how many courses you're taking and which courses you plan to take. I'm an incoming first year as well hoping to declare a combined honours in statistics and CS. My first year is going to look like this: (There may be some variations considering course registration isn't available yet and I'm still waiting to see if MATH 1030 equivalent is offered at the Truro campus). I personally think this is quite a heavy course load, but pretty standard for first year. If I'm going to take 5 courses at all, I'd rather it be in first year where the courses are pretty foundational.\n\nBIOL 1010, MATH 1000, STAT 1060, CSCI 1105, SCIE 1111\n\nBIOL 1011, MATH 1010, STAT 2080, CSCI 1110, MATH 1030",

Spend the first couple weeks figuring out what studying is best for you and your first couple midterms will probably be a wakeup call. \n\nI took BIOL1010/1011, CHEM1011/1012, MATH1215 STAT1060, PERF1000/1001, GWST1010 and ECON1102 in first year and came out with a great gpa thanks to my electives being interesting and not too difficult (except econ I would not recommend)",

Just make sure to look up which ones are prereqs for 3000+ courses you want to take",

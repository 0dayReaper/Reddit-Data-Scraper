    "postText": "I\u2019ve had four midterms. \n\nOnce the exam starts, you\u2019re supposed to stfu. \n\nBut people CAN\u2019T STOP TALKING. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve finished. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re leaving. When the test has started and you\u2019re in the exam room, where people are taking an exam and trying to focus, you can\u2019t talk to other students. Why is this a hard concept?\n\nAt my last midterm, when there was 10 minutes left, the professor told people to stay in their seats once they finished the exam, so the sound of 50 people leaving at once wouldn\u2019t be a huge distraction. \n\nMultiple people broke this rule and left anyways. The professor reiterated the rule multiple times. THEY KEPT LEAVING. \n\nWhen there was five minutes left, the professor told people that the next person to talk would be reported to the department head. A minute later the people next to me started whispering. Nothing happened to them, btw. \n\nProfessors should kick people out the moment they break the rules. Idgaf. It\u2019s not hard to be quiet. \n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about phones. Before the exam starts, you should take two seconds and silence your phone. So why am I hearing notification dings and ringtones, four or more times per exam? \n\nIt takes zero effort to be quiet. \n\nThere\u2019s zero reason not to be quiet. \n\nAnd there\u2019s zero reason why professors shouldn\u2019t kick you out. \n\nI don\u2019t understand.",

Felt like cancelling the test, but then it punishes students who are actually doing what they should and that is not ok. \n\nIf the room is large enough, it is just not possible to write the name of everyone talking down and have them sent to the AI process. Never though we would need to deal with stuff like that at that.",

If the card isn't on the corner you rip the test and they can stay sitting in their seat or leave the exam hall with their card in their pocket knowing their exam has been identified for AI. \n\nSame goes for not wearing a mask, (I hate masks and am guilty of not wearing it the odd day) no mask, no test. It shouldn't be a surprise to the student.",

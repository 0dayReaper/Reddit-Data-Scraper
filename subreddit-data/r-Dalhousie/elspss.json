I\u2019m also happy with the level of support people give each other here, and I wish that this existed in the Stone Age when I went to school. My real life ID is not a mystery, I\u2019m Christian Blouin. I just don\u2019t want to create a work profile and turn this into actual work ;) There are, in fact, a few other profs and staff members answering questions on their own time.",

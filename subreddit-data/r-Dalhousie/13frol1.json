    "postText": "I have applied for a position, but curious about the expectations as the job description is a little vague in comparison to similar ones at other unis. \n\nCurious, how many times do you have to do the \"rounds\"? Is that 2-3 times a week? Or are you simply on duty meaning being in your room available 2-3 times a week?\n\nIm from another uni where you would have to be on duty in your room 2-3 times a week, and then you only did the \"rounds\" to 2/3am a couple times a term? Is it the same at Dal? Or do you do those rounds every 30 min until 2/3am every week 2-3 times?",

I\u2019m pretty sure you can live off campus and be a CST. CATs have office hours.",

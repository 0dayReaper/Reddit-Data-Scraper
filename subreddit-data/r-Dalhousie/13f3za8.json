Ask if you can meet with them to discuss possible involvement with their lab. Honestly, just try to be sincere and show genuine interest in their research!",

The following is more appropriate for when you actually sit down and talk with any professors who get back to you, but be up front about your goals and what you're hoping to get out of the volunteer experience: whether you're exploring a potential career in research or wanting to gain some experience to help with a med school application, both are fine, but you (and the prof) will have a bad time if you're not on the same page. Above all, be clear about how much time you can commit and try to stick to whatever arrangement you come to.",

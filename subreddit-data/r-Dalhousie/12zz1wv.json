    "postText": "CUPE's priority guidelines seem wrong to me. How am I supposed to get a CUPE TA or marker position at DAL if the person with the most DAL TA experience always gets chosen. How am I even supposed to gain the necessary experience for the position if the person who has TA'd it for the past 3 years is always picked?!",

            "comment": "I got my TAing position for the first time in fall of my 3rd year of my bachelors, (which was technically my 2nd year of CS), to be chosen as a TA when younger you need to build a strong connection with your professor, get great grades in your classes, and work well with others. In my undergrad  first year I did really poorly in my science classes (non computer science) but later upon returning to dal years later in my computer science classes made sure to get 100% on everything I could to prove to professors I was capable of it, and to ensure my later goals when applying to programs later on down the road. If you put in the work even if you did poorly in your first year of classes you can still become a TA / Marker if you've proven that you know the material well enough and you built up a strong relationship with the teaching professor. \n\nTheres multiple other factors such as many phd students and masters students often having priority for some classes but thats expected as often their supervisor will want to give them hours so they can eat, pay rent, pay tuition, ect. \n\nAs well typically it will happen the phd and masters students happen to be the most qualified to TA/Mark too because for example if a prof is the only one at dal studying say nuclear reactions their students will also be researching things similar to that meaning they probably have the best background for teaching the class over another student.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThats my take on why its like that, you typically want to allow those that have been teaching to continue rather than bring in new students every semester which might result in mixed results per semester in TA / Marker quality",

            "comment": "As others have mentioned, several factors are involved with picking TA/M/Ds. \n\n1. Graduate students will always get priority over undergrads because Dalhousie mandates that graduate students TA a couple courses river their degree (requirement to graduate).\n2. You generally need a grade of A- or higher in a course to TA/M/D it, ESPECIALLY if multiple people want the position.\n3. If you rank a course lower in your preference (if you apply for multiple roles in a semester), there is a chance you are less likely to be picked for it, even if you have a better grade because you ranked it lower.\n4. Your relationship with the prof MATTERS! If you were active in class, met with them during office hours, talked with them after class, etc., you are MUCH MORE likely to be a position because the prof has a relationship with you/they know your work ethic and interests! It's a two-way street.\n\n The focus is on the profs and the students. Also, would you (as a student or imagine yourself as the prof) rather have someone with more direct experience and knowledge of the course subject or someone who has never been a TA before TA the class? Nine times out of ten, the prof will pick the person they know best and feel most comfortable with. I know it can be frustrating when you are first starting, and it is infuriating when others (those with experience) are picked ahead of you, but ultimately, the prof chooses who they think will help them (and the students) the most.\n\nI got my first couple of positions because I was active in classes, did well, and engaged with the prof (had a professional relationship with them during and continued after the class). The profs saw that I was interested in the course material and what they were teaching. However, my advice is to email all the profs of the courses you want to TA/D.M and say things along the lines of \"Hi, I would love the opportunity to TA/D/M your course for XYZ reasons, and while I may not have ranked this course my first choice, I would love the opportunity to keep learning from you and to help students learn.\" Remember, your email is essentially a cover letter for them. \n\nWhen starting, apply for multiple TA/D/M roles, even ones you are not 100% enthused about. It helps increase the odds of you getting picked, which increases the odds of getting a role in future for positions you are more interested in. Best of luck to you when applying!",

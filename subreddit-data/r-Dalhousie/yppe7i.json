I've contacted student accounts although they just say that the university isn't issuing a refund at all, and to wait for furthur updates. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's insane, we're all adults paying for a service we are not receiving, why does it matter we're students?  I'm losing out on hundreds of dollars of services I've paid for due to this strike and I'd like financial reimbursement. Is this legal? Are we entitled to anything? Who should I be spamming with emails to bug them for a refund?",

I haven't been able to find a source.\n\nI hope that Dal has a reliable contingency. During my undergrad at UManitoba, when the faculty went on strike, the Fall term was pushed into January and the lost content was split between two terms so the damage was minimized and spread out. I wonder if Dal has something like this in mind, giving that DFA (the union representing faculty here) might strike in the winter term.",

With such a big international population and students out of province it will be hard to track everything and anything in terms of symptoms and tracking quarantine. Hopefully they can figure something out for the Winter term so we don\u2019t lose the full year!",

I still hope that campus will be open so students may study in small groups and not be forced to do work at home it is doesn't work for them. It really comes down to what is considered to be safe, and whether Dal can staff/afford enough people in the janitorial staff to meet new and much higher sanitation standards.\n\nAs for tuitions, we agree that emergency online courses feels less valuable to you (it does to us too), but this year is nowhere less expensive to operate. I hope that auxiliary fees, where operating costs are actually down, will be set to as low as they can. Although University is expensive, no one is operating with greed in mind. \n\nThe call had to be made early enough to give everyone time to figure things out, but it is still a long way from Sept and we don't know how much better it will be by then. I'm an optimist, and so should you.",

This means that if you are not living in Halifax, you are guarantee not to have to move here for the fall. \n\nWhat is possible, and yet to determine, is whether campus will be open to an extent and we can offer optional learning activities. Since the courses are online, it can't be mandatory. Also, many students just work better \\*not\\* home, and being able to come on campus to work/study may be good. \n\nIt will all depend on provincial rules, and Dal's ability to keep the buildings safe.",

With that being said, personally I\u2019m happy with any opportunity to continue on with school any way possible. It\u2019s a lot better than them pushing the semester or something crazy like that! \n\nI\u2019ve been out of school for a few years after getting my first degree and trust me (like everyone probably already knows), in the work force you\u2019re going to deal with stuff you don\u2019t want to do but you have to. I know you get paid to do it but I\u2019m just trying to show that sometimes things don\u2019t play out the way we want; we just have to deal with it and get through it. \n\nTemporary bump in the road but in the long run it will be worth it to be able to graduate on time and move on to your career or next degree! \n\nNot everyone may agree with me but just some positivity when everyone may be dreading what\u2019s going to happen!",

With that said if enrolment stays the same and they have to change the programs and invest more in online learning like they already stated they have, I\u2019m not holding my breath that we will have cheaper tuition. The money has to come from somewhere and if it goes down now it will go up even higher later. Universities are businesses at the end of the day and their goal is to make a profit, I\u2019ve always believed this even though I like school lol",

But when I\u2019m from Nova Scotia and have to pay 8000-9000 for my tuition, and you look at a place like Quebec for instance where in province students pay half of that, it\u2019s just odd to me. \nEveryone has the right to an education, if you can afford it. \n\nWith that said I understand the importance of education to employers and you need to get a degree or a trade to learn skills to be able to go into the workforce. But to say that a universities goal isn\u2019t to make a profit seems strange to me because if they didn\u2019t make a profit then they couldn\u2019t hire teachers, or offer co-op/clinical placements, have all the technology and resources to deliver the material etc. \n\nWe are paying for a service for someone to deliver to us, that definitely seems like a business to me. Again, I don\u2019t know where the money goes and what it\u2019s all used for, but when one program costs 9000 a year at one school and 4500 at another for the same piece of paper, it\u2019s just hard not to think of it as a business; to me anyway.\n\nAt the end of the day, I\u2019m still gonna pay it because I want to go to school and get a degree in a field that I want to work! Lol. This will be my second degree, I love school and learning and to me the money is worth it, but that\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to say is that it\u2019s sort of like a business!",

Historically the student vote could have been a deal breaker for separation. The separatists don't want to piss off their voting base, the federalists don't want to lose completely the young vote. It works out great for students. I was one of them. NS doesn't subsidize as much, and less than most other province. The real cost of your education is closer to $26,000, not $9,000. This is what International students pay, and what is costs to study in a private institution in the US. \n\nA profit is the money that you make after covering costs. Business want to make profit to redistribute to share holders, buy a new yacht, invest in other money making enterprise. A university doesn't aim to make a profit because when it does, it puts it back into its budget. In CS, every single penny we make goes into hiring more profs to one day reduce class size. Students ultimately benefit from profit, not shareholders, CEOs. Currently, universities tend to lose money rather than earn at the end of the year. Dal is just about staying on the floating line, many NS universities are not. \n\nThis being said, there is no university that I know of that doesn't have a hard time just balancing expenses and revenues. If it was a business, no one would want to have a part of this. What you call profit is really revenue. It costs a lot to run an university, but no one tries to make a profit off tuitions. Big new shiny building are all paid by donations from wealthy donors. The poor state of repairs in some classroom is a better gauge of a univeristy's pocket money. \n\nI hope that this is sensical/helpful.",

It seems, unfortunately, that you didn't complete your res application soon enough, and there were no rooms left in Howe when your turn came.\n\nYou can talk to Res Life about it, but remember that res is currently full. They don't have a room that they can move both of you to.\n\nI'd talk to your friend and have him propose to Res Life that they offer his bed to your roommate. Gerard is a 10-15 minute walk from Studley campus, where most first year classes are. A room in Howe is better for most people, so they might be more likely to accept.",

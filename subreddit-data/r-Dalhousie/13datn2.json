    "postText": "I have confirmed my acceptance to Dalhousie with a \"decision made\" as my application status. I have also applied for residence. I live in Nova Scotia and am completing my IB program (I also get my Nova Scotia High School Diploma). Unfortunately, my final exam preparation is not going smoothly and I may not receive my IB Diploma. Can Dalhousie still revoke its decision if my final grade does not match its minimum requirements or if I do not receive my IB Diploma? Also, the IB final grades come out in July and course registration for Dal starts in June.",

They dont need to know your final ib grades unless things have changed, they care about your highschool official reported grades which are before final ib exams. but talk to an advisor i suppose.",

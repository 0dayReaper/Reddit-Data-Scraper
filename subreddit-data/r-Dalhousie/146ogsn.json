I probably wouldn't have a ton of hope for this one, but you could potentially get a spot any time between now and the last day to add courses in Sept.",

I just took that course, and by second semester it seemed a quarter or half the students dropped it, so I assume they\u2019ll take that into account when added extra students for the course. If you\u2019re a marine bio student, you can aways reach out and email the prof. She is super nice and understanding",

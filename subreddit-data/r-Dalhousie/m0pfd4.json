    "postText": "Today, the polls for the new DSU execs have been opened. I, as an international student, have been closely watching the student body politics since I arrived here in the fall of 2019, and managed to go watch the debate for the last election where we got our current execs. I am sad to say that even though promises were made to at least put out a voice for the students demanding a halt and reconfiguration of ever-rising tuition fees, and now the same presidential candidate from the last election is running unopposed during this pandemic, where the DSU's publicity is ever so low, basically free re-election. I urge students to vote in their best interests, I am voting No Confidence for the presidency, as I simply can not vote for someone who hasn't dedicated their presidency to decreasing tuition costs at all, especially during the pandemic where most of the student body isn't even on campus, but elsewhere dealing with this pandemic, you'd think it would encourage getting actually important things done.\n\nNot allowing the current president to retain their presidency; the DSU will be without a president for a couple of months, but we'd still have the executives to run the show and it would give time for a real presidential election to happen, where we can actually choose from candidates rather than be stuck with the hand we are dealt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow I've actually found these budget sheets from 19-20 and 20-21, and found out the following:\n\n**Change in expenses:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**President**   *25% Increased Expenses*\n\n**Vice President (Internal)**   *14% Decreased Expenses*\n\n**Vice President (Finance &amp; Operations)**   *17% Decreased Expenses*\n\n**Vice President (Academic &amp; External)**   *14% Decreased Expenses*\n\n**Vice President (Student Life)**   *15% Decreased Expenses*\n\n**Council Administration**   *35% Decreased Expenses*\n\n**Elections** *4% Increased Expenses*\n\nAdministration's expenses as a whole went down by 8%, and we see 14-17% decreases in expenses across the board on the executive's side, but a 25% Increase on the president's side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ulyd4acw5vl61.jpg?width=907&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4f82d4b084d4c65ded16cf67b998f9c0920d8d77\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4djif0uw5vl61.jpg?width=1044&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c515cdab6c912945f31c7e6450b01c46029b2ffd",

This means adding mission and vision statements and creating 5,7, and 10 year goals through extensive student consultation. This work would focus on a future based on equity, accessibility, and transparency.~~*\n3. *~~Focus on getting students back to campus as soon as is safe through work with the Dalhousie Return to Campus Committee, the DSU executive, and student societies. This looks like advocating for the reopening of key spaces, accessible and equitable delivery of courses, better student supports and resources, and providing opportunities for students to connect and thrive.~~*\n\n\"\n\n*~~}~~*",

            "comment": "Ok. So I worked in the DSU for 6 years. In multiple departments and for multiple execs. The dsu does NOT CONTROL TUITION FEES. It\u2019s the board of governors at the budget meeting. There are two elected students positions that hold two year terms and the president sits. I know that it\u2019s been at least 5 years straight that the two student representatives and the president have asked that tuition not be increased if Dal won\u2019t reduce it. They are always outvoted and the budget is approved because they are two Seats of over a dozen. Furthermore, the DSU literally can\u2019t function without the president. The execs are all overworked and usually put in 40-60 hours a week. They don\u2019t have the time to split another person\u2019s role that is outside their skill set while they are all also in their own classes. If you actually want a run down of what a president or any exec has done during the year, please just show up to office hours. Don\u2019t claim on Reddit to be informed when you do not the system through which it worked. The student union is you UNION. They advocate and obviously they have tried but there\u2019s only so much anyone can do. Especially considering there was a pandemic so they had to go through budget cuts and do a re-org after the everything that happened the previous year. For those who don\u2019t know, the previous execs cut the two longest teniored full time staffed positions out of nowhere without a transition plan resulting in a loss of contracts, jobs, many service cuts and 30+\nDSU specific experience out the window. They had to mop it up while managing student concerns during a pandemic. Please put it all into consideration. Tuition prices are always at the forefront of DSU advocacy and there\u2019s only so much a human can do. If you think having no advocate for you in these meetings with Deans, program chairs and presidents is actually going to help you? You are sadly mistaken. It will probably invite more Tuition hikes and a loss of more campus resources without a president to advocate.",

Trying to get have no one in the role hurts everyone. Go work for an exec. Join a committee and run next year. Watch the DSU council meetings to stay up date. I strongly dislike that some positions will be running unopposed but we are in a pandemic so there\u2019s less on campus student participa and awareness this last year. Have you thought of getting involved yourself and running? You are obviously passionate. All that\u2019s left is to get stay up to date &amp; stay informed. The best way to do that is work at the union. Are you doing that?",

                    "comment": "Thank you for this. I don't think people really understand how a union functions. The DSU is a separate entity from Dalhousie. The union's function is to represent students at the university and the provincial/municipal level, offer services such as the health plan, food bank, and more, and initiate programming, campaigns, and events that students want. When it comes to tuition the DSU has been at the forefront of that fight for ages and despite the president and the 2 student reps voting for reduce tuition at the BOG, the university has denied all their pleas. The idea that the president should lose their job because the university keeps denying their pleas for reduced tuition is ridiculous. Especially during a global pandemic, the union cannot organize rallies and protests without risking the student's safety. All they can do is make proposals or draft policies/ recommendations to the BOG and Maddie has been doing a damn good job at that. If anyone wants to know exactly what she has been doing this past year, all you gotta do is ask. You can read all the exec reports online, or attend the biweekly council meetings to stay up to date on everything that happens, or just ask.  \n\n\nI highly recommend anyone that has better ideas on how to fight back against increased tuitions to either run for office or support the work the DSU has been doing. Maybe then students will have more choice on who leads them.",

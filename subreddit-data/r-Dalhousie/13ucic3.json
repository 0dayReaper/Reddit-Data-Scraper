I\u2019d really encourage you to reach out to someone for support - I know it\u2019s scary but there are resources available and people do want to help.",

In the case of disability, supporting documentation includes a psycho- educational assessment using adult scales; SAC/SSC\u2019s medical assessment form; or a letter from a healthcare practitioner identifying current and potential barriers, types of support.\u201d\n\nI also have adhd and they made me get a note from my dr, basically it stated my diagnosis and what accommodations they thought I would need.",

            "comment": "it\u2019s possible but it is really unlikely and if you do get them, they will be very limited unfortunately. there will need to be some form of evidence to justify certain accommodations. when you apply on the accommodations page, you will be required to upload supporting documentation outlining what specific supports you need and a brief explanation. for example; a letter from a doctor or psychologist explaining the diagnosis and support needed. additionally, accomodations can not be granted without meeting with an advisor but documentation must be approved before you meet with them. i would encourage you to reach out to health &amp; wellness in the mean time to start the process but it is unlikely that you\u2019ll get accomodations without proof",

This included extra time on tests, quizzes, etc, when everything was online still. They request I get an assessment as soon as possible, and gave me contact info for their psychologist at Dal, who focuses on learning disabilities, who then gave me info on where I can assessed. All while I was waiting to see the psychologist and then waiting to get assessed, I had accommodations.",

            "comment": "Ok so You need to go to student services and they will arrange for you to see a student advisor from accessibility services. Ideally you would see student health but they may be able to secure you some accom ms whilst you are waiting to be seen. It\u2019s also an idea to reach out to your prof etc. The usual process is that they respond to the accommodations arranged by the student advisor but they may be able to give you some leeway once they know you are waiting to be seen. I\u2019d really encourage you to call student health - there are many many students in this situation  so you are not alone and with a little bit of help you will feel a lot better and people can get cracking in trying to support you. The vast majority of profs will bend over backwards to help. Please reach out- it can get better .",

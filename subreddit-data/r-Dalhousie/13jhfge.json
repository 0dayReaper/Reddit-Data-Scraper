I\u2019m still choosing where I want to go (it\u2019s down to dal vs uottawa) so next week I\u2019ll be visiting campus. Any recommendations for things to do nearby? I\u2019m coming from ontario and I\u2019ll only be there for two days but restaurant recs or places to go to get a feel for halifax would be great! Thanks :)",

Besides that, Halifax is wonderful, right on the Atlantic, which is perfect if you love being on the water. Meanwhile, as every other Canadian city, it\u2019s a bit dry during the winter, still fun, but not too much to do while also keeping up with your academics. I recommend this city to anyone, and I honestly love it, and plan on staying here in the long term.",

I've lived here for almost 15 years and I'll be going to dal in the fall, and I really don't like it here; I'd leave and go to another city if I was financially able to, but that's not the case. Having been lucky enough to travel often to see family abroad as well as travel internationally in general, Halifax is nothing by comparison. Has it improved over the past few years? Yes. But you can only visit Point Pleasant Park and walk the waterfront so many times. \n\n(Sorry about the rant)",

When I was living abroad, although it is nice etc\u2026 but I got sick of it. Therefore when I moved to Halifax, I was like wow this is amazing, it\u2019s beautiful. In terms of Halifax itself, I\u2019ve always came here since I was little, has it grown though? Yes. It\u2019s so different from before. I\u2019m happy with the trend, it\u2019s growing very quickly, starting to look like an actual city!",

            "comment": "As a person who has been to ottawa a few times and have friends studying there, I would recommend dal over uottawa. Uottawa has uninformed administration issues for several years (almost to the extent of york). Both universities have hit or miss professors/instructors, but only one has a worse student life (uottawa according to my friends). Student life in dal so far is pretty good and i am not being biased. Both universities are great in terms of a STEM education but unfortunately, if you are interested in govt jobs, uottawa is the way to go, but dal is a good choice for govt opportunities as well (just not on uottawa levels). In terms of city, i found ottawa a bit boring no offence, it felt pale in comparison to other bigger cities in canada like toronto. Ottawa is a bit bigger than halifax, probably more accessible in terms of transit since halifax only offers busses. I found halifax a lot prettier, found fair amount of stuff to do. In terms of doing and seeing stuff, ottawa is more or less the same as halifax. Also, if you are more interested in ottawa, id suggest looking into carleton university as well, they have great STEM programs (some of the programs having better profs and resources than uottawa), great campus and student life etc, but its not near downtown ottawa so that could be a minus. I hope I helped you in any way and sorry if I couldn\u2019t, also i\u2019d greatly appreciate if anyone wants to further clarify the points I have stated!",

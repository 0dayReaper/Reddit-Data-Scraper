The prof is absolutely amazing, he teaches well and his exams can be easy if you study (he gives practice exams for every question on the test) and I do suggest keeping it on your \u201cpossibility\u201d list for classes!",

Idk i read over someone else\u2019s subreddit that they took up astronomy and it was an easy class , tbh astronomy is the only part of physics i actually like lol. Ive no clue what to take tbh, i wanna major in psychology so I took bio and psychology as my science subjects , i dont really need one more but I think I\u2019d go for another science instead of philosophy or something , cause I don\u2019t wanna do a content heavy subject tbh",

However if it would just be a course to fill a credit space, you could totally do Astronomy (I never took that course). I took physics because I\u2019m going into marine bio and ocean sci",

Unless you\u2019re in a BSc, you only need 6 credit hours (i.e., 2 courses) in a science subject to meet general program requirements. \n\nIf you need more, these are the subjects that fall under Life/Physical Sciences: Biochemistry and molecular biology, biology, chemistry, computer science, earth sciences, economics, engineering, environmental science, human physiology* (for BA only), informatics, marine biology, mathematics, microbiology and immunology, neuroscience, oceanography, physics, psychology, science, statistics, and sustainability (for BA only)",

For programs that have both BA and BSc options (e.g., economics), the difference is typically the math requirement (and sometimes chemistry? Can\u2019t remember them all). If you have the math requirement down, and a decent gpa, you would have a good chance of being accepted. So, I would take MATH 1000 and MATH/STAT 1060 and if your goal is psychology or neuroscience, enroll in the intro courses to those subjects. \n\nAlso, if math isn\u2019t your strong suite (it wasn\u2019t mine), I would look at taking it late this summer. Taking one class will allow you to really immerse yourself in the material (remember, unless it\u2019s changed, it isn\u2019t enough to just pass the math requirements, you\u2019ll need at least a C average).",

Almost half of Dal expenses are covered by government contributions which are funded by the taxes paid by Canadians. Most international students (and their families) will not have paid Canadian taxes and thus will not have contributed to this portion of university funding. The extra tuition offsets this.\n\nDoesn't make it easier for international students to afford their tuition, but it does justify why they pay more.",

And yes international student weren't born here meaning the won't have been paying taxes for a while but u also have to remember that they spend money on shit,many have to even find jobs to pay their fees meaning the end up paying taxes anyways and when someone of them even gets permanent residence they end up working and paying taxes again. Unless you are in favor of gatekeeping higher education to only those that are able to pay 30+ thousand a year.",

With that argument why don't we increase the cost of everything from buses to healthcare for international students because the deficit has to be made anyways. Dal is a public uni it's goal should never be making money. If it was a private uni we are talking about the I wouldn't care but it is a public uni. And even if the difference has to be made does that have to come at the expense of others people? It seems you don't understand how much of a pain it is for international students to be paying that high(some even have to work multiple jobs in-between school to make tuition for God sake)",

I assume you are referring to international students. If so, then yes I think it should. They get the benefit of the education. They will get the benefit of better jobs in the future.

If you never pay Canadian taxes then it makes sense that you should pay full price for university. But if you\u2019re going to stick around and contribute to the economy then you shouldn\u2019t have to pay twice for education, once through tuition and a second time through taxes. It should be constructed in a way so that you get back all the international tuition fees after like 30 years or so.",

I was a former international student, so I think paying the international differential fee makes sense to me. If the international students are charged like domestic students, universities would ask the government for more money and the government will have to raise taxes. Which inturn affects all of us.",

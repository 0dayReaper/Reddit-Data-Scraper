    "postText": "I've been reading a lot of posts here from students who feel like they're absolutely powerless to being taken advantage of by the administration. This just simply isn't true. In university labour disputes, students are one of the most powerful stakeholders involved because students pay tuition. \n\nAs someone who was heavily involved in organizing the CUPE 3912 strike I can say for certain that the most consequential moment during the entire strike was the Student Walkout Rally in the Quad. This rally was absolutely instrumental in getting the strike to end. Before this event, the administration thought that students were blaming CUPE 3912. After this event, the administration realized that students were on the side of their teachers. The administration's monetary offers for a collective agreement and tone during bargaining completely changed after this and an agreement was soon reached.\n\nThis is not unique to Dalhousie. At [American University](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/08/26/american-university-strike-staff/) in Washington this year, students walked out of convocation to support striking university staff. Within a week the strike was over.\n\nBecause students pay tuition, they have far more rights than striking employees. They can do things such as enter buildings that striking employees just can't do. Students are also protected by [Dalhousie's Student Code of Conduct (D1: 2-3)](https://cdn.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/dept/university_secretariat/policy-repository/Code%20of%20Student%20Conduct%20rev%20Sept%202021.pdf) which gives students the unique right to free discussion and assembly.\n\nLastly, I just want to say that after the last few homecoming parties, the administration is absolutely TERRIFIED of undergrads. They're just thankful that students decided to party in neighborhoods rather than on campus. That's just the power students have when they're disorganized so imagine the power students can have when organized. \n\nThere are plenty of great student leaders in and out of DSU. Now is the time for us to begin planning what we are going to do in the event of a DFA strike. If we're prepared and make our voices heard clearly we can end the strike quickly and maybe even get back some of the tuition we paid for our education.\n\nEDIT: I should note that the Student Walkout was organized by DSU and other non-CUPE 3912 students.",

Apathy has been a big factor in getting to the situation we are in today.",

            "comment": "This post is awesome. Students should hold the university accountable for the quality of the education they are providing. Quebec also had many successful student protests probably 10 years ago now. For the DFA strike it is more complicated than the CUPE strike. CUPE members were objectively being taken advantage of and underpaid, this is not the case of the DFA. \n\nSome of the proposals by the university are a strategy to eliminate some of the internal chaos  in the university and ensure that professors are actively working on objectives that align with  the objectives of the university. There are arguments to both sides of this.\n\nIf the profs are essentially self governed (which is ultimately what they want) who are they accountable to besides themselves? The university is accountable to the government, doners and students who all help pay the bills. If the university cannot get broad alignment from their staff in achieving common goals, it is hard to convince external parties that the university is a good investment.\n\nOn the flip side, the university has been neglecting students needs for strong, modern and innovative education as well gaslighting the students about the quality of services being provided at Dal.\n\nI think students should be neither all for the DFA or all for the university. Both parties have policies that negatively impact the programs at Dalhousie and proposals that remedy other issues. I would argue that students should be trying to bring both sides to a neutral middle which positively impacts students first and foremost. This is definitely a good time to assert ourselves we just need to know what we want from the University and the DFA and make it known. I'm sure there are many voices on all sides of this conversation. I'm jaded from 4 years of electrical engineering admittedly.",

I will say I am admittedly not as well versed on these particular concerns. However, while I certainly appreciate holding professors more accountable, I don\u2019t believe the senior administration is trying to hold the faculty more accountable to students. They\u2019re trying to hold the faculty more accountable to the senior administration which is not going to result in better education whatsoever. As we learned last term, senior administration is completely unconcerned with the quality of education. Secondly, they\u2019re just absolutely clueless about the value of different research projects. They love to fund and show off extravagant but ultimately meritless research that they can brag about in marketing.\n\nThe topic I can talk with certainty is budget priorities. Dalhousie has been consistently reducing the portion of the budget spent on education for the past two decades and that is definitely bad for students. Well paid educators are more competitive and more talented. Faculty pay should, at minimum, be matched with inflation. I can also comfortably say that trying to end the 90:10 rule is very bad. Volunteering for CUPE 3912 really opened my eyes to how being part time allows the administration to exploit instructors in so many dishonest and backhanded ways in terms of salary, benefits, and job security. One thing I think students should all agree on supporting the DFA on is that tuition should be spent on education. \n\n\u201cOur Tuition for Our Teachers\u201d",

                            "comment": "There are two pieces to this. \n\n1) Faculty does need to be accountable to management. If they aren't then it is impossible for Dalhousie to execute on a collective vision or strategy. Course should all be delivered in a similar fashion for instance across the university why should individual profs be allowed to skip on brightspace. Just one example where there should be consistency. \n\n2) Management needs to be accountable to the students and community. They should be plotting a course that represents the needs of the communities they serve. Right now I'd argue they are running a self-serving enterprise that is essentially an extortion scheme to milk money out of the government and students to overpay key administrators...\n\nWe shouldn't be making rules to mitigate bad management because if the DSU or government wants something changed for the betterment of education delivery in Nova Scotia they can't lobby individual profs or departments they can only lobby management. If management has no control the organization is just aimlessly existing and lobby is impossible. It's about putting in a good organizational structure and filling it with the right people. Right now we have the WRONG people.\n\n\u201cOur Tuition for Our Teachers\u201d is a great rallying point and should be a message sent directly to management. Management doesn't have to suck but they currently do and have no inkling on how to run a successful organization or deliver high quality services efficiently.",

Unfortunately, the senior administration is oblivious to most things that happen online and on campus and they were definitely oblivious to the impression high school students (and their parents) were getting about the university. They might realize the impact next year but still may not properly attribute it.\n\nThis is ideally how things should work when labor is withheld. Workers not working should lead to less product being sold. But in the context of a university there\u2019s quite a delay between these two and the impact to the university\u2019s bottom line might be realized too late. \n\nSo, if you do want to target prospective students, the trick is to do so in a very public way in front of the senior administration. That\u2019s why we picketed Dal\u2019s biggest open house event in the fall and I do recall the senior administration taking note then.",

            "comment": "Thanks for this. There are lots of people on this sub that unwittingly contribute to a self-fulfilling prophecy regarding student power and representation, especially from the DSU. And I fully understand that it comes from years and years of frustration, most often preceding this year. However, if you are convinced that the DSU is useless, it will be. This is true of any democratic body of government because democracy *requires* civic engagement. And you are less likely to engage with something you think is useless. If you want stronger representation, please show up to an Annual General Meeting, run for a position on Council, attend our Council meetings, VOTE, respond to surveys, or write an email!\n\nWe relentlessly advertised our Annual General Meeting this year with an opportunity for a Q&amp;A with CUPE 3912 representatives. During this meeting, we reported on our work, shared key developments within the university, and held an open question &amp; answer forum to help students inform future activities. But only 80 people showed up. The engagement from the people who came was *incredible*. But we have over 20,000 students. Where was everybody else? Especially those who want stronger representation? There were posters covering nearly every inch of campus plus lettering across the SUB windows. Ultimately, we do understand that the very reasons that students want stronger representation also serve as barriers for civic engagement in a democracy. Please know that I do have *so* much empathy for this. But it's not an excuse and we still need everyone and anyone who cares to please show up. A lot of necessary advocacy takes place through relationship-building and lobbying. But in these contexts, it doesn't matter how much we research and prepare for these if admin can point to poor voter turnout (or poor survey turnout, etc.) to undermine our credibility, especially when we're asking for exactly what students do want.\n\nShowing up is not necessarily going to solve every single issue but it will help so much more than you know. We cannot have an all or nothing approach to student empowerment. I say that as someone who has truly lived through several Dal^(TM) disasters. We instead need to cover all our bases. And that includes organizing independently outside of the DSU as well to complement lobbying with direct action and mobilization.",

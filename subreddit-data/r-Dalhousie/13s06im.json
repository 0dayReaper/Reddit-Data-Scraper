I\u2019m really into mythology and always have been and I see that there is two classes that cover mythology. However both classes have the exact same description and I can\u2019t tell the difference between them. If someone knows would you please let me know, I\u2019m really confused \nSorry if this didn\u2019t make scene. I\u2019m dyslexic and I\u2019ve posted to redit once before and idk what I\u2019m doing, thank you for the help!",

The day / room / time / material is all the same, it's just that some students use it as a History credit and some use it for Theatre, because the material is relevant to both.)",

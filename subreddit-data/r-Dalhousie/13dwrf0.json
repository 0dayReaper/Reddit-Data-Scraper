That said, 3000 level polisci classes are in my experience closer to an easy 2000 level king\u2019s class, likewise for 2000 polisci being frankly easier than FYP",

If you're doing a BA with FYP, your degree would also require two semesters of a science course and two semesters of a language course. \n\nHSTC1201/1202 are a chronological history of science that is designed to follow a pretty similar timeline of FYP, and taking them together can be really beneficial to get a more complete view of the pairing between the more literary side of things that FYP covers and how developments in science interact with and bounce off of philosophies of the time. The important thing there is that this is crosslisted as a science course, and so you can complete your science requirements with it.\n\nSomeone else here has recommended intro human geography; another one I've heard is an easy science course is intro astronomy but I can't speak to that myself.\n\nThe other offhand option is to take a language; there's generally no reading requirements and it tends to not be a horrible amount of work. Ancient languages (Greek, Latin, Hebrew, etc.) can be heavier on the reading/translating end of things compared to modern languages, but if you're interested in classics they can be very fun! \n\nTo some extent I would say that if you can get away with doing *only* FYP without electives, that's also a very good option. It really is such a work-heavy course that being able to dedicate that extra time is a massive bonus. The other main benefit to focusing on the other requirements is that it gives you time to form a solid foundation for any other courses that you take. A lot of 2000+ courses at King's and Dal humanities don't *require* you to have taken introductory courses to their subjects, but they're often constructed with the assumption that you will have. Waiting until second year to dive into those can help you get more out of them with that foundation, and also gives you the benefit of having gone through FYP to figure out perhaps what you're more interested in. \n\nIf you want to chat more about these or other 2000 level classes or really anything else more directly, feel free to send me a DM!",

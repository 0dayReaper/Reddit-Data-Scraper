    "postText": "So I switched from a BA to a BSC a year ago and I looked at my degree audit and none of my first year courses are counting. I just finished my second year and it does say I have 60 credit hours, but it says I have not fulfilled my writing requirement or math requirement (I did those in my first year as a BA). I thought I got transfer credits, so is it just an error?",

            "comment": "The only reason I see your writing and math credits not transferring is that they need to fit the specific requirements within the degree. A BSc often needs more math requirements than a BA (so not fulfilled because you need more), and the writing requirement can sometimes only be filled because only one or two courses work for the credit.\n\nIt could be that the credits you took as a BA do not work for a BSc or an error. Either way, talk with a Student Success Advisor at the [Bisset Student Sucess Centre](https://www.dal.ca/campus_life/academic-support/student-success-centre/appointment.html) (linked) who can help with the transferring credits/what is needed to graduate according to Dalhousie as well as an [advisor from your faculty](https://www.dal.ca/campus_life/academic-support/advising/where-to-go-for-advising.html) (linked) who can make sure you are on track within your specific degree.",

That can be really helpful. Get to know your dean or assistant dean if they're cool.  Dr. Christian Blouin from comp sci is a god damn legend. A half hour chat with him can really set you up for success, if you're in that faculty. \n\nHow's your time management? Buy this: https://www.amazon.ca/Time-Box-Planner-Productivity-Efficiently/dp/B0BF9T24D9\n\nHow's your mental health and physical health? Gym 3+ times a week makes everything else easier, and gives you more time in your week paradoxically. \n\nHow's your social group?  If you're just gaming online, I'd advise to get involved in some university clubs to expand your real-life circle.",

It is a process, it won't be stagnant in its current state your whole life, it diminishes with time and exposure. \n\nAre you active at the gym? Integrating that is 1.5 --&gt; 2x more effective than any medication if you have a base level anxiety messing with you.  If you haven't, check out [https://thefitness.wiki/](https://thefitness.wiki/) created by /r/gym\n\nThe Math learning centre was always helpful for me! I would go there after each class, and if I couldn't get the assignment done, I would get into office hours to get a one on one with the prof. The only way to learn math is by having someone show you how to do it. The prof is a free and ultimate source of info! Take advantage. But also, make a friend in the class to work with. It'll make a big difference in both your grades and anxiety,",

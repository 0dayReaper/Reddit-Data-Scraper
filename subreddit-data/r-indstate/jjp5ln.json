All campus buildings are safe to reopen.*\n\n*As a reminder, the Terre Haute Police have the lead in apprehending the suspect and investigating this off-campus situation. The ISU Police Department is assisting. While details will be forthcoming from the THPD, it appears that: (1) the suspect and victim are known to each other, and (2) neither are ISU students. ISU Police and University Communication will provide additional details when it is warranted.*\n\n*Please join me in sending continued thoughts and prayers for the victim.*\n\n*President Deborah J. Curtis, Ph.D.*\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nHope this helps put any worries to rest.",

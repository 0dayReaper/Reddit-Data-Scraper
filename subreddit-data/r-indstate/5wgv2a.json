I know tour-guide barbie has to say they do, but that doesn't actually mean that they do.\n\nHow many students live off campus? On my visit it seemed that housing was really geared towards freshmen, and not so much upper class men.",

I haven't talked to anyone in flight school, but I'd imagine it's pretty similar. \n\nI'd say most students Junior and above live off campus. I lived on campus my Junior year and had a Senior roommate though, so it's not set in stone. ",

Don't do an iPad. \n\nAs for off campus, I'm currently a senior and I live on campus, but that's because I've got scholarships for it. It's pretty heavily biased towards freshmen, but there's a decent mix of upper classmen. ",

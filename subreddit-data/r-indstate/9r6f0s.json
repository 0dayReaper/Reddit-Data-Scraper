I've tried the library but it's always crowded there, as well as like study/social lounges (also typically crowded), but I hate working in my dorm. Any suggestions?",

My favorite places to go on campus are in the tiered part of Starbucks, the second floor of the science building, and the lobby in Stalker Hall. Of course the fountain is also a fantastic spot when the weather is nice. ",

Not too many people think about it because you have to walk around the outside to get to the actual place. Most of the people who walk around there are faculty anyways so not always super noisy.",

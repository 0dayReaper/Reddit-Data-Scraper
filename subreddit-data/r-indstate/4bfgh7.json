Tho trading hasn't been put in the apk yet, john hanke has said that there will be trading. If for some reason they have to change that our community is prepared. Our web app that is in testing currently has a communication part for real time communication between pokemon go players, an Intel map showing where pokemon have been caught, a silph road web store, and once the trade mechanic of the game has been added there will be that too.",

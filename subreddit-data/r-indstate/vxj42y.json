    "postText": "Hello everyone in the ISU subreddit!  I am working with Tree House Eatery &amp; Drinkery just north of campus, where 7th &amp; Elm used to be.  We are trying to build into a restaurant/bar format that is very friendly to college students in the area.  I just thought I would reach out and see if anyone had any suggestions that we could implement to make the atmosphere more college friendly.  The Verve and Bally have the more dancing/club atmosphere, we are trying to build ourselves into more of a relaxed environment.  Thanks in advance Sycamores!",

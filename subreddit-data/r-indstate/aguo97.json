            "comment": "Hi! I'm currently a second-semester Freshman studying Computer Science at ISU, and I've had a ton of great experiences with the CS program here. The faculty here is extremely knowledgeable, and since the CS program here is on the smaller side, I've had have the opportunity to connect with my Professors a lot more and ask for personal help. We've had alumni go on to work at big names like Google, Oracle, the NSA, HP, Wells Fargo, etc, etc!\n\nOn the academic side of things, the CS Major is structured to be mostly theoretical, in order to give the student the knowledge to be successful in any area of CS, while also giving the student a practical set of real world skills and several programming languages under their belt. This is how most CS programs around the US are structured, since it can be quite complicated to update to keep up with the 'newest trends' every year. Currently there are two concentrations that you may focus on in the CS program, the 'Computing Science Concentration', and the 'Information Science Concentration', the former being more popular and more theoretical (Algorithms, Formal Methods, etc), and with the latter being more practical (Web Programming, Linux Administration, etc). It may seem limiting to have to pick a concentration, but in reality, most of the CS Majors here do a mix of both concentrations, fulfilling the requirements for one concentration, while taking as many classes from the other as they can. The faculty is currently expanding and reorganizing the program here, so more concentrations could be added or the current two expanded upon in the future. The Department is also changing what language is used in a couple classes (for example: CS 151 is changing from JavaScript to Python, etc).\n\nRight now, the main programming language of the program is C (and also C++), which are both considered to be 'harder' languages when compared to like JavaScript or Python. The thought is that if you master a really 'hard' programming language, it becomes easier to master an 'easier' one (and in my experience this has been true). Also, the main OS used here in the CS program is Linux/Unix, which is awesome since most enterprise servers/databases use some variation of that.\n\nOne weakness that I would say the CS program has in terms of academics would be the lack of instruction about hardware. Not a ton of time is devoted towards the physical side of computers vs the software side of computers. To my knowledge however, there are one or two classes that focus on that subject, and there are a few options for you to get that background here, such as obtaining a Computer Engineering Technology minor, which would give you that hardware knowledge/background (like a friend of mine is doing).\n\nAs far as the program's structure, here is a list of courses in ISU's CS program, with some background info on each [here](https://catalog.indstate.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&amp;poid=5351&amp;returnto=1058), and [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/132TyxuUWKb_uVohAidL6lcrglVcJupRb0k8isOAngEc/edit) is a pre-requisite map of the program. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions, I'd be happy to help! :)",

            "comment": "Hey. I'm currently of Junior Status at ISU right now. I've been here for 2 years and have a lot of thoughts about our CS department. First I want to reference an email all CS majors got from the head of our department, Dr. Kinne:\n\n\"Cheers all.\u00a0 I have recently asked for and received some feedback from outside of ISU on how our alumni are doing.\u00a0 Specifically, I asked for feedback from places where some of our stronger students have ended up (PhD programs and the like).\n\nStrengths - communication skills (both with supervisors and others \\[e.g., undergrads for those in PhD programs\\]).\n\nWeaknesses - on average, our strongest students would have benefited from a more competitive environment.\u00a0 In both programming skills/projects and theory (CS theory but also the theory of AI, DB, etc.), the reports often indicate our students are not as prepared as the top/good students at name-brand universities.\u00a0 The reports also indicate that our students often do not have quite the work ethic as top students from other universities.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to add on my own list of strengths and weaknesses for the CS department as well:\n\nStrengths:\n\nProfessors - Our professors are insanely smart. There is no doubting the knowledge they have. Being a smaller CS department, you will likely have many of these professors multiple times before you graduate, so you will get to know your profs really well.\n\nSmall classes - (once again, small department = generally small classes)\n\nFocus on Low Level Language- The main focus as far as languages go at ISU is primarily C. They also have other focuses on Python, and Javascript/Html. The main focus for teaching is C and even though C is an old language, it is really a helpful thing. C is a fairly low level language (closer to machine code) as far as actual languages go. It forces you to learn how the computer works and how to manipulate it. By focusing in C, it makes other more modern languages easier to learn and kind of a piece of cake.  \n\nWeaknesses:\n\nProfessors- Notice how they are on both lists. Many of our professors do have some weird quirks. Some struggle to communicate, some make extremely hard tests (that usually end up being curved). Our only really bad professor left last year (thank god) but generally, once you figure out these quirks, you are fine.\n\nCurriculum to an Extent- Our curriculum is lacking in some places. Particularly in math, hardware, and modern languages. A CS degree here doesn't require many credit hours. Usually, you will have room for 1 or 2 minors that you can help supplement your degree. For instance, I plan on picking up a mathematics minor and a computer engineering tech minor to supplement the lack of math and hardware. Overall, the lack of modern languages isn't a bad thing. I explained why its a good thing earlier. They are currently changing this by making the 2 entry level classes Python (CS 151 and CS 201).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDefinitely check out the [CS classes](https://catalog.indstate.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&amp;poid=5351&amp;returnto=1058) at ISU and the overall [Major Info](https://www.indstate.edu/academics/undergraduate/majors/computer-science) for CS here. If you play your cards right, you can pick up both concentrations and 2 majors (that's what I'm doing). Sorry for the lengthy response. Please feel free to reply and I will gladly reply back.",

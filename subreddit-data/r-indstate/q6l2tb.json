Between roommates shuffling around and whatnot, there are sometimes dorm rooms that are temporarily empty. Over holiday breaks, particularly Christmas/winter break, some colleges let international students stay in the dorms for added fees, so maybe ISU has an opening somewhere?\n\nHope this helps!",

            "comment": "It's almost impossible to come up with something like a pros and cons list when what I like might be something you hate, and vice-versa. As long as you keep that in mind...\n\nThe trains suck, the crows suck, and Terre Haute in general is a pretty boring city with the feeling of a medium-to-large *town*. Parking can be a pain, especially if you don't get a student parking pass each year, and jobs worth having aren't as common as they should be for a city the size of Terre Haute, which provides you with everything you *need* but little of what you might *want*... Despite that, the school itself is *okay*: it's nothing fancy as far as universities go, but it has some good programs and professors. It has a really great recreation center that offers state-of-the-art exercising resources along with a pool, hot tub, and sauna. It has a pretty awesome library with many unique and priceless texts (among other more contemporary things) and provides fantastic study spots. But to be completely honest, ISU is just somewhere in the middle of everything: it's not great, but it's not horrible.\n\nPersonally, it's my belief that ISU is going through some growing pains... It's trying to establish itself as a competitor to other (bigger) schools without really admitting it but when called-out on it, tries to blush behind a small school projection. It tries to tout being small enough to provide rich learning experiences like the smaller schools can who enjoy smaller class sizes while also trying to project itself as a Midwestern academic powerhouse for things like teaching programs or other general liberal arts. Enrollment costs keep going up in its journey through this, but the actual academic offerings rarely improve to such an extent as to dissuade students from opting for or leaving to other schools who are more established and better versed in whatever the learners are pursuing. At ISU, teaching treks are its namesake. I believe the music, psychology, language and linguistics programs are pretty strong, too. Surprisingly, its tech stuff is pretty good for a state school, too. You'd be best to just contact the school and ask to arrange an interview with whatever department faculty you'd like to speak with. I'm sure that would help.\n\nBut like most (if not all?) schools, much of your experience will just depend on **you** and your own proactive efforts or work ethics. You can't just pick up a major and expect a fruitful career if all you do is pass your classes. You have to get your hands dirty and get to know both your classmates and professors, be on good terms across the board, get references from EVERYONE you work for or with or alongside, and dive into internships but also the career fairs. Network your ass off. But in doing all of that, try to find ways to enjoy life, too, but going to the rec center and any other events that sound fun, like the various sporting events over at the Hulman Center or ball diamonds, the plays over in the theater, the speaker series, etc. There's also tons of student clubs worth looking into to say nothing about its Greek life (which is very active). And if it all gets too overwhelming or you need someone to speak to, it has a great student counseling center that you can arrange to speak to someone from which has many qualified people to vent stress to. (I speak from experience.)\n\nIf you come to ISU, I'm sure you'll do fine. It does well in preparing students and makes it pretty damn hard to fail. Just don't be a spud. Get involved, be active, and always remember what you're at school for.\n\nI hope that helps. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.",

                            "comment": "&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; What\u2019s the political climate like? \n\nAs far as subjects or events related to state or national politics? It's a pretty docile campus but in my opinion, it leans more towards how most universities lean: liberal-progressive. There are pockets of conservative types but in my experiences, it's not the students who ever push politics. It's the professors and administration and in my opinion, should be held accountable for it as their ideological expression seeps into what would otherwise be useful political discourse. But beyond that, these kinds of states I'm alluding to rarely break out in anything like protests or any other noise. It's almost always a peaceful environment. Sometimes you might see someone at the fountain broadcasting political or theological preference, but most people just walk past these types and those doing the harking usually leave after a few hours. But with all this being said, I think there's a fair balance between conservatives and liberals, democrats and republicans. There might be a few others in their enclaves, but nobody around campus besides those more passionate about the topics really goes out of their way to make their views known. Most are pretty reserved about it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Is campus accepting to the LGBT community?\n\nAbsolutely, but understand that it goes without saying (hopefully) that it's just like with anything else that can be construed as controversial subject matter: people can be kind, but the moment a view or opinion is considered as being \"pushed\" is the moment someone can go from being distant to defensive. I'm not just saying that about someone with LGBTQ+ views or affiliations, but anyone with **ANY** view or belief. (I'm guessing that didn't need to be stated, but sometimes it does as I hate being that person who assumed something only to later realize that something happens that could've been avoided if only I had said a thing, ya know?) Anyway, as an institution, **many** resources exist for members of that community, but for whatever it's worth, the campus tries to remove the demarcation between \"that community\" and \"everyone else\" by fostering single, cohesive community initiatives meant to be accepting of all walks of life. (In other words, it tries to prevent tribes.) \n\nThat said, I believe there's a few student-based clubs or organizations on campus and in town who seek to establish safe spaces and provide some great resources for the LGBTQ+ community and their allies, and this includes the [LGBT Student Resource Center](https://www.indstate.edu/student-affairs/msp/resource-centers/lgbt-resource-center/about) and the [Sycamore Safe Zone](https://www.indstate.edu/student-affairs/msp/resource-centers/lgbt-resource-center/programs/safe-zone). Although it's not directly managed by ISU, the [Pride Center](https://safespacealliance.com/listing/pride-center-of-terre-haute/) is basically across the street from the College of Business and offers assistance for those associated to LGBTQ+ lifestyles. The [student counseling center](https://www.indstate.edu/student-counseling-center) offers various levels of assistance, too. In fact, that might be one of the best resources as they'll likely have support groups and some of the best awareness of what resources ISU specifically offers. The [Affirmative Action office](https://www.indstate.edu/inclusive-excellence), which I believe is the same thing as the Office of... that it is now) also provides assurances for safety, assistance, etc. as does the [Office of Equal Opportunity and Title IX](https://www.indstate.edu/equalopportunity-titleix). Of course, there's always going to be jerks around, especially at night, but the campus doesn't tolerate harassment or anything related thereof, so should anything bad ever happen (such as harassment, etc.) be sure to report it the moment it does. On campus, we have extensions that everyone can dial without area codes or prefixes using on-campus telephone networks. The one extension that every student should know off the top of their head is \"5555\" (which is [Public Safety / University Police](https://www2.indstate.edu/pubsafety/)). Obviously, there's 911, too, but you'll have a quicker response if using 5555. If off-campus, it's 812-237-5555. There's also public safety stations along sidewalks that act as emergency kiosks that people can use if anything bad happens. They're like little 7-foot stations that have an emergency button on them and when pressed, contacts campus police.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; What is the engineering program like?\n\nThis, I can't comment on and if I try, I'm liable to say something about it that isn't true or might sway you in a way that you might not prefer... So, [I'll just link to their website instead](https://www.indstate.edu/engineering#engineering-). Another helpful link might be the [list of majors page](https://www.indstate.edu/academics/undergraduate/majors), which might be informative in terms of knowing which courses are required for a respective major (i.e. - major trek). But as far as the engineering stuff is concerned, that's all within the [College of Tech](https://www.indstate.edu/technology/), which is right across the street from the College of Business and has some pretty cool stuff in it, like various manufacturing machines, CAD labs, and it also has a flight simulator that you might be able to pay someone a case of beer to let you fly in... ;.)\n\nYou might ask for Dr. Randy Peters. I had him years ago for an automotive 101 type course and always found him to be very easy-going and helpful. [I believe he's the chair of the engineering department](https://www.indstate.edu/technology/sites/technology.indstate.edu/files/COT/210160-COT%20Organizational%20Chart-pf3.pdf), now, but I could be wrong. Call to confirm. For whatever it's worth, I've never heard any bad things about the engineering stuff.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; What tutoring options are available?\n\nFrom my experiences, that often depends on the department and whether any of your professors have access to any GA (graduate assistants). There's always office hours where you can go chat with the instructor, too, which can often be a great way to get to know the professor, too. But besides that, I believe the library had a team that provided research paper writing assistance and I guess there's an actual [tutoring services team](https://www.indstate.edu/services/center-student-success-cfss/tutoring-services/courses-tutored) on campus meant solely for providing tutoring to students (which I honestly didn't know about until I just did a search for it). But 9 times out of 10, your instructor / professor will have someone or something in mind that can provide those kinds of services respective to the class you're taking, mostly in the form of GAs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI hope this helps. If you have any other questions, fire away. :) But don't be afraid to either call departments to speak to arrange times to speak with professors or else look professors up [on the directory](https://www.indstate.edu/search/faculty-staff) to call or e-mail them directly, etc. Phone is usually better, but it just depends on the person, too.",

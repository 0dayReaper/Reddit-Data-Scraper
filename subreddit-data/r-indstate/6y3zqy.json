Need recommendations on nicer apartments in good areas.\n\nSaw Sycamore Terrace and Heritage Trails...does anyone have any information on either of these?  Mid-20's with pets.  Am i missing any other nice complexes?\nThanks so much!",

            "comment": "I can really only echo what people said in the /r/terrehaute thread, both are nice places although I don't know the pet policy. The Deming is great for students because it is right off campus, although I wouldn't imagine they'd allow pets, additionally it likely has a younger population. Cobblestone Crossing is very nice and closer to campus than some of the places farther south. Avoid anything north of the tracks on campus, the area directly north of Poplar by campus can be pretty hit or miss as well.",

Not sure what there is in the way of hiking up here, but I hear Garden of the Gods down in Southern Illinois is a blast (bit biased, seeing as I'm from there), but that's a three hour drive down and you WILL have ZERO cell reception, so if you go plan accordingly.\n\nIf you fancy a ride in a (small) airplane you can grab a flight over Terre Haute out at Sky King airport.\n\nIf you're a shooter, Top Guns has an indoor range and they charge something like $45/hour or $45/month for a membership. I hear there's an outdoor range on the outside of town somewhere that has a better rate and has a student rate.\n\n\nThat's about all I got though.",

Or trains. Or planes. Really, this is an impressively noisy town for the Midwest.",

Though the geese that live in the 'lake' behind my apartment wake me up more than the planes. Noisy, hateful bastards.\n\nThis time of year, you'll freeze your third arm off before it has the chance to grow. Unless we hit one of those like 70+ degree days like we did last Feb.",

I'm not sure if they still even do it, but it might be worth asking around about. ",

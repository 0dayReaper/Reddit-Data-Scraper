    "postText": "Hey everyone...hope you all are having a wonderful break!\n\nSo my son, a freshman this year, struggled a bit with the whole Blackboard thing. In the transition to college, somehow he missed that assignments are in Blackboard and not necessarily explicitly announced.\n\nDoes that sound correct? I have to ask because I graduated from college over 25 years ago, and things like Blackboard weren't around back then. Assignments were primarily turned into a departmental office (like project-level assignments) or in recitations. This wasn't ISU, btw, but I would guess most colleges operated similarly.\n\nThat said, I feel more confident he has a better understand of where things went wrong for some of his classes, but if you have any tips for us (I'd like to know for more own edification as well) on how classes, assignments, and Blackboard typically work at ISU, I would appreciate the input. Oh, and the syllabus -- is this typically in Blackboard as well? Is that where assignments are laid out for the semester?\n\nThanks, everyone, and have a fantastic spring semester!",

            "comment": "Ideally, Blackboard should have the syllabus as well as at least a rough schedule of projects for each class. Blackboard is also how I submitted nearly all of my assignments and projects throughout college, either by uploading documents or doing them within the form provided by Blackboard. Especially in the tech-forward courses/majors, very few assignments and projects are done or turned in physically.\n\nAssuming the Professor is competent, my guess is that assignments **are** being announced in class, just not in the way your son is used to. Despite this, that information should be available on Blackboard either in an assignments section, the syllabus, or a schedule. If this isn't happening, they should talk to their Professor about it. I'm going to guess every student in the class is not also missing this many assignments? If that's the case, something was missed.\n\nThis coming semester, I would suggest they start taking notes on assignments, their due dates, requirements, and anything else that the instructor says, whether it's covered on the syllabus or not. That way, if there's a discrepancy between the instructor's oral instructions and the syllabus that they are required to create and post on Blackboard, it can be clarified.\n\nSo in short, it's likely that everything that can be submitted through Blackboard, will be. It's easier for the instructor and the students, especially in larger classes. Assignments should be and probably are being announced in class, albeit not to the extent that they were in high school (reminders of deadlines, reiterating things that are spelled out on the Syllabus). Lastly, Blackboard should have a Syllabus for every course they are and were enrolled in. Ideally the Syllabus would be able to answer any question about the course they had, but outside of that they should be communication with the instructor if they are having issues.",

            "comment": "One good thing that your student can do is make it a routine to check Blackboard (as well as your Portal and University Email) everyday. I'm also a Freshman this year, and I can't tell you how many times I caught things I would've missed last semester because I always made an effort to do so. If your student has any friends who are in the same class, it can be a great idea for your student to reach out to them from time to time to make sure both their friend and your student have everything sorted out. Going to your Prof's Office Hours or even talking to them for a few minutes right after class also can really help clear things up.\n\nAlso, some classes also have their own website as well that sort of act as a second resource in conjunction with Blackboard. For example, I am a Computer Science Major, and my CS 170 class that I am taking this upcoming semester has its own website where extra info is posted. I'm not sure if this is pretty much exclusive to IT/CS classes, or if other programs have that sort of thing too, but it can't hurt to look/ask!\n\nI hope your student has a great upcoming semester! :)",

There were assignments in those classes of which he said he had no clue. He failed to grasp how important the syllabus was and how it often refers to other details in Blackboard as part of a course.\n\nThanks again -- I really appreciate your input. IT grad myself; good luck next semester!",

            "comment": "How I survived was get a planner and take the syllabuses/course calendar for all my classes and write the dates (if given) of when items are due. I used washi tape and a black marker just in case the assignment was moved to a different date. If the student is more technical savvy, he could use the phone app on Blackboard. It shows a seven day outlook of what assignments are due (depending if the professor uses that feature) and if you swipe you can keep looking if there is more assignment coming up. He could also use his phone calendar and type in what assignment for what class and color code it too. \n\nRemember tutoring is free on campus, tutors can\u2019t do the assignment; however, they could give him an idea of how to do it. \n\nIf he has any question alway talk to your professor, when the professor knows you they seem to help you succeed more than others I found.

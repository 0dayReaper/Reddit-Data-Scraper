I already have a room reserved in 500 next year with 3 friends, and I know the general size of tall the bedrooms, but I was wondering if there is anyone that lives there right now and could measure the bedroom?\nI don't need the size of the living area, just the bedroom area, and the closet of the bedroom.",

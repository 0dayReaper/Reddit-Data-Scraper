    "postText": "Ayo, full disclosure: Chi Alpha recruited me on campus as a sophomore at ISU back in 2017-2018. At first, it was all well and good, I met some people that were pretty great. However, a majority were not. Myself and my roommate were converted by a couple of girls on campus passing out popsicles by our school\u2019s fountain. We had an awesome chat, stayed for a couple of hours, and agreed to go to a group meeting the following Thursday. It was nice that we had like 2 great leaders, who actually ended up leaving around the same time we did. After doing some volunteer work for the organization, that is when things took a turn for the worse. \n\nWe had just welcomed in a couple more group members who were gay (big supporter of someone who is all the way LGBTQ+ and loves the community - I\u2019m a straight white girl), and they immediately were bashed for who they were and the lifestyle they lived. It made me flood to protect them. That made me realize that this group wasn\u2019t at all what you preach it is and what they praised it was. \n\nWe went to a huge retreat somewhere in Ohio I think...not really sure where it was. But at this retreat, 2 days of worship going from 8 AM to 5 PM were long and hard. During one of the final prayer sessions, we all went our different places to pray and sing and just think to ourselves. I had told the story of my father suddenly passing away right before I entered college to only a few people. Someone I didn\u2019t tell this story come up to me and told me that God had spoken to her and said my dad was in her and was speaking through her....yeah, that didn\u2019t jive with me. It felt very cultish and after that retreat and being exhiled pretty much by leaving from the group\u2019s main leader - a bald headed, beady eyed, awful and rude asshole - I can successfully say my religion is strong and I still have my main Catholic ideals. Plus, I freaking love Pope Francis.",

I\u2019m a huge believer, but not when it comes to outing other people. I believe Hod loves everyone and accepts everyone, despite what they say. That\u2019s not the God I believe in. God loves everyone. That\u2019s how I interpreted his word. But yeah, the lesson I learned was that I was young and naive and still broken and that I got taken advantage of.",

From the experiences I've observed, it's usually something that many of the younger and religiously-inclined students have problems handling well because they tend to collide with people who subscribe to different worldviews, many of which can often lead to situations that can be difficult to religiously reconcile. I think it's important to prepare yourself for that possibility (and it sounds like you're doing that, so props to you). It's all easier said than done, I know.",

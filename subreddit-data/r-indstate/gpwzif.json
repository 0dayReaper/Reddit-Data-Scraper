I just looked through a few things and couldn't find any explicit indication about that but that doesn't mean it's not offered--ISU has always had issues with providing an easy-to-find medium for people.\n\nThat said, I'd contact the College of Health and Human Services tomorrow and just ask a few people about it. Here's some contact information for that:\n\nhttps://www.indstate.edu/health/department/son/contact-us\n\nCall at least 2 people to be sure you have a consensus. You don't want to rely on the first student worker who thinks they know the answer to your question, ya know? Make sure you get a hold of at least 1 full-time staff member (faculty preferred) to ask your question(s) to. If you run into issues with this, let me know.",

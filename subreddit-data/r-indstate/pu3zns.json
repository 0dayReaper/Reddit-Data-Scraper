LOL\n\nI encourage living in the dorm for at LEAST the first year, if not more. Your kid probably needs life and coping skills that she'll acquire by living in the dorm. They do a LOT of growing up and have to make their own decisions on things, as opposed to having parents swoop in to rescue them. Not to mention, exposure to different people from different cultures and life experiences.",

Which an apartment could be, but the school knows where the apartment complexes are. \n\n If it's any consolation, our dorms aren't that bad. She'd more than likely be in \"The Towers\", which are the newest and not terrible. Once you're a sophomore by credit hours, you can live off campus",

Assuming you fit the bill, you could designate her address as your home's address but then just rent her an apartment somewhere. \n\nGood luck.",

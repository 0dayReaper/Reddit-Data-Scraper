Is this on any sort of bus route?\n\nThank you!",

It is right next to the low income housing, so there's a lot of drug traffic in and out of there.   I'm pretty sure the city bus runs but I don't know the time.  It is also married student housing or it used to be at least, so you will have neighbors that may be married and have kids.  Its different for sure, if you can find a way to opt out of it I would and find somewhere else to live, because if they're charging dorm prices it's worse than the dorms",

I lived there 18-19 and it has had a directly negative effect in my health in regards to my lungs and sinuses. They are moldy, the internet is slow, the AC barely works, and they're a mile away, I high discourage considering to live here.",

The *incentive*.\n\nIn other words, why should a bunch of strangers coordinate between themselves to figure out a plan to \"design a poster\" on their free time (without being paid) in order to advertise for a university's events and issues on a medium that essentially duplicates what can already be found on any number of already-existing ISU-based websites and outlets?",

It's just a forum, really, with occasional posts about things going on around ISU. It's already working and since people already volunteer their submissions, well, what other kind of volunteerism can really be expected? If you're interested in marketing something, don't waste your time doing it for this website. Make your own and actually get something back for your efforts.\n\n...but hey, don't let anyone take any air out of your sail. If you want to volunteer unnecessarily for something that realistically, nobody will really appreciate or reward you for, by all means, have at it. I'm all for volunteerism, but I'll be damned if I'll be a glutton for punishment or someone's beast of burden. It's a waste of time and energy.\n\nFor whatever it's worth, you'll probably think I'm being sarcastic or cynical here but I honestly do hope you get something going here. I'd love to see more activity on this subreddit.",

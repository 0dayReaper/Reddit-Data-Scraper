    "postText": "Yesterday, many people got to experience Brother Jeb and his gang of low hanging fruits. People get overwhelmed and worked up about what he says, and to be honest that's why he comes. If people were to simply ignore him and his gang, they would stop coming. Trust me there are better things to do than argue with a dumb old man.\n\nAlso quick announcement: they come multiple times in the year. So let your friends know to just avoid them.\n\nTldr: avoid crazy religious people that follow Brother Jeb.",

Graduated 12 years ago, can't believe no one's beaten him to death yet. \n\nAgreed on the suggestion though, people think they're standing up to him but argues, insults, and threats just feed into his madness.

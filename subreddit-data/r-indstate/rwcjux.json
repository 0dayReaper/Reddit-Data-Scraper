When doing assignments, on what platform are they assigned? My high school uses canvas, and I was wondering if it\u2019s something similar? I only ask because navigating the student portal is a bit of a nightmare. Thanks!!",

Because in these conversations, \"student portal\" can be a different system.\n\nIf you know for certain that it's Canvas that's the nightmare, what *specifically* is it that causes you headaches? You said it's navigating it... Are you saying you don't see links that make sense or is it that you have too many things to click on? (Asking to see if ways exist to improve the interfaces or discern whether this is an actual system issue vs. one more associated to how it's being used by the faculty who might be structuring things in ways that might be illogical, etc.)",

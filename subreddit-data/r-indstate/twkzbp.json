There's going to be campus activities every weekend and an occasional concert or comedian in town. Plenty of outdoor activities if you like that. D1 sports at ISU if you like watching those. I don't know much about the nursing school so I can't speak too much to that (sorry). \n\nBut honestly the best way to find out if you like a campus is to tour it. The school I assumed I'd go to in HS, I didn't even up applying to because of a poor campus tour. Conversely, the school I ended up going too wasn't even on my initial list and I only toured as an extra credit assignment for an AP class.",

Usually a lot of those who don\u2019t get into the program go the public health route because it doesn\u2019t set you back and can set you up to try nursing again after",

Always something going on wether that be on campus or in the town it's self. I know we have a very respected and competitive nursing program. The hospitals in TH rk are really wanting ISU nurses. One thing I will say tho nursing is unique because unlike other majors it's going to be very much the same where ever you go",

Neither of us like the college but it's right here so we're stuck with it. \n\nShe's In the speech pathologist masters program and recently one of the professors quit so they are having them retake the entire class. This was 10 weeks in to the 16 week course so they were almost done. Thing is, one of the professors there said she could teach the class but wouldn't because she wanted to punish the students for being \"too hard\" on a new professor. Don't buy into the billboard bullshit. These professors don't care.",

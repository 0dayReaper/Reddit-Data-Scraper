I\u2019m considering transferring to ISU for business administration and was wondering on how difficult the coursework is and if you can balance school with social life.",

I do not know what your major at Purdue is but if it is anything besides engineering I assure you it won't be much different. Transferring schools won't get you out of difficult classes.",

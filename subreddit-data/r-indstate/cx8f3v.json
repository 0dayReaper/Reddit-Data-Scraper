    "postText": "So I've requested a roommate change, as I went random and I got possibly the worst roommate on campus, as in only showered twice in 2 weeks caught him masturbating multiple times bad roommate. My RA and AHD and such have all but confirmed it should be going through but what I'm wondering is do you guys think I would get a solo room or be put in with another guy that doesn't have a roommate? I was thinking it would be a room to myself as I feel Reslife wouldn't want to make someone have to move all of their stuff to make room for a second person after the year has started. I just want some input/thoughts.",

Or you could be lucky and not get a roommate till like the second semester. They always send out a email saying either you\u2019ll pay for a full room or you\u2019ll get a roommate.",

            "comment": "For ISU, it's a fantastic department. Granted, I graduated back in 2007, so I think a lot has changed since then but at least during those years, it was great. I think a lot of your experience will depend on how much you put into it (as the old adage goes) but I also think a lot of it will depend on how much you invest in the relationships you get the opportunity to develop. Take those extra steps to ask questions, visit your instructors during office hours, etc. to really immerse yourself into the lessons. It probably goes without saying but much of the journey will also depend on how much work you do with your actual development of the programming you guys do during the courses: just reading about things isn't an approach that will work. And unless things have changed, I think the department focuses mostly on big shop languages, like C, Java, etc. PHP or open-source in general wasn't or maybe isn't really something they use a lot with in their curriculum but there are definitely opportunities to use it within the studies. Besides that, there's plenty of database design courses, concept-based classwork, and I think there's more than enough project-based things like making your own apps to showcase and use in classwork. It's all good stuff. Depending on who your frequent profs are, you'll probably be put into many algorithm studies, too. (After all, that's mostly what CS is... IT or something less-CS would be more focused or geared towards application of things like \"making apps.\" But don't get me wrong: you do a lot of that in CS, too, it's just that in CS, it's mostly all about efficiencies and algorithms.)\n\nAdditionally, be proactive in trying to get into extracurricular things. It might sound like a broken record, but there is truth in being a well-rounded person and since these other things outside of the immediate academic stuff helps you network with people, it's a win-win. Start with looking for and getting into some clubs.\n\nOne more thing: keep an eye out for things like internships. It's one of the best--and sometimes, only--ways to get your foot into doors. You don't want to idle around and never get into your field, so be looking around and ask people for leads on things like this. One that comes to mind is one I actually took part in, which is Sycamore Technology Solutions. It's an internship the Office of Information Technology oversees and puts them into situations where they act as IT leads for the local non-profits. When I took part in it, all of us had specializations that we worked in. I specialized in web development, so I worked mostly on non-profit websites and back then, the pay was...better than most student jobs. But be forewarned: if you get a job in this, you'll experience times where you'll get stressed-out a bit (at least, if things are still managed like they were back when I was one of the interns). Besides that, it's one of the best experiences I had during my entire undergrad and led to the career I have today, which turned out okay for me.\n\nHope all this helps. If you have any questions, let me know.",

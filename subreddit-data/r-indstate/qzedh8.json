            "comment": "If you're out past sundown (normally, any time past 10 PM), the chances of something bad happening increase by the hour, more so if during a weekend, and even more so if you find yourself in or around one of the avenues or basically anywhere that there isn't a lot of traffic or in areas known for rough bars (see the area where Simrell's used to be at 7th and Deming or The Ballyhoo at 9th and Chestnut as examples). Terre Haute *proper* (basically the immediate areas in and around the mall, Downtown (the storefront areas at and around a 7th and Wabash 1-mile radius), almost all along Wabash, all around Baesler's and all along Ohio Boulevard from 25th all the way to Deming Park, or up along 46 up to the I-70 exit) are probably the safest areas. So that leaves the bad areas: any off-street, \"The Avenues,\" the notorious \"Frat Row\" (which, if I remember correctly, is basically 6th Street between Poplar and Washington Avenue--boy do I have stories!), any area comprised of big homes used for tenancy or Section 8, lots of areas North of the railroad tracks just across from the ISU campus and between it and Union Hospital, or any rough areas prone to things like dark alleys and the usual vandalism and theft which comes with them. You'll quickly recognize where these places are if or when you visit--they're easy to spot. \"West T\" has an unnecessarily bad rep (in my opinion) but I have to admit that I haven't seen all of it, too. The areas I have seen--which is just across the Cherry / Ohio bridge and into the main strip--wasn't that bad. In fact, some of it is actually pretty due to things like the woods, simple homes, the wet lands, etc. Just North of it is Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College, which is a pretty campus. The main areas of West T aren't that bad, but you can see some areas that are absolutely ran down with what are likely just people who don't have a lot of money or who likely suffer from drug issues (which is just more sad than it is scary or anything worth worrying that much about).\n\nAnyway, none of this should be very shocking if you're familiar with Middle-class America. The city doesn't really supersede any experiences one might suffer in other cities or towns of equal size. God knows I've seen worse...and for the most part, Terre Haute is actually pretty safe, especially in the safer areas I mentioned above which is where most will spend the majority of their time in. If anything bad ever does happen, the cops are quite responsive, with campus police keeping things as safe as a campus can be (but don't be shocked if you hear about things happening every so often, especially at night, during weekends, or during events). I believe [Public Safety's webpage](https://www2.indstate.edu/pubsafety/) has info you might like to check out because I think somewhere on there is the campus safety reports which have some useful info about things like crime rates on campus, the types of reports that were made during specific times, etc. (I don't have the exact link, which is why I just linked to their main page but I think it's on there somewhere.)\n\nI hope this helps and if you have any other questions, ask away. :)",

Indiana is unpredictable with snow; however, the workers are good about clearing popular walkways and laying down salt. My professors with weather never cancel, I\u2019m in the nursing program you are expected to drive in it. I know a few of my non program classes are randomly canceled due to professors being sick but not of weather, you would be notified by email and/or blackboard.",

            "comment": "Definitely no bike. Terre Haute isn't very bicycle friendly, in my experience. When it comes to campus, walking will suffice.  Use the car to go anywhere else. \n\nAnother commenter said that the weather is a bit unpredictable. That's true. It can be 75 degrees on one day and 35 degrees the next. It can be humid in the summer, but the sun won't beat down like in Texas. Winter can get pretty cold, but not like Michigan.  Honestly, for a good all-around winter coat, go to a place like Rural King and get something that's actually warm and not just fashionable.  The same goes for gloves and hat. \n\nNo matter what, best of luck to your student at Indiana State. Go Sycamores!",

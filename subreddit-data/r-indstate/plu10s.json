Would I be fine in some dressy khaki slacks or do I need to get some charcoal or black. Dressing fancy isn't exactly my thing.",

                            "comment": "It comes awfully close to a financial discrimination inquiry, at least, it does to me. I also wonder if the respective faculty member told you this to compel you to wear something beyond what they may have assumed you *might* wear (without knowing you personally, I mean). What I mean by this is, maybe the professor just assumed that you're some ignorant twenty-something who gets drunk each night who knows nothing about professional appearances? (Not that I'm trying to assume anything about the instructor, but alas, those of this level of presumptuous ignorance absolutely do exist.)\n\nEither way, if all you have is a pair of decent jeans (no holes, rips, etc.), a decent shirt, decent shoes...that should be more than enough, especially if it's all you can afford (hence my idea about it qualifying for reporting to someone higher up). \n\nI've been at ISU in various capacities since 2002 and I've never once heard about a student being barred entry to a career fair for no other reason than wearing a business-casual attire for an event known for walking around to meet different people in a casual sense, or *any* kind of attire for that matter... It'd be awfully odd to think they'd do that today considering how hands-on some fields tend to be and knowing how different cultural standards are between different fields. Regardless, someone who is trying to better their career opportunities (who is a student of all people) shouldn't be penalized for trying to acclimate to it, let alone, barred from experiencing any mistakes which arise from poor clothing decisions (which is the only way some might learn).\n\nAnother way to confirm this would be to contact the [Career Center](https://www.indstate.edu/career-center) at (812) 237-5000. Try to speak to an actual staff member, too. (The center itself is right next to the fountain to the South East, so maybe just walk in the next time you're in the area? They're all very helpful, but just ask them outright, \"Will I be barred from entry if I come wearing clean and non-ripped jeans with a nice dress shirt, etc.?\" If they say yes, let me know.)",

Just warning me that this is a much more professional career fair. I have all the resources necessary to dress up, I just don't enjoy to. I appreciate the concern though",

I'd still see if someone would actually prevent you entry if you wore jeans, if not to see if you could wear them then definitely to know if someone would do that. I'd love to know, to be honest, because I never heard of that happening and if they do that now, it'd be something I'd want to ask around about to see who it might've been that instituted the change.",

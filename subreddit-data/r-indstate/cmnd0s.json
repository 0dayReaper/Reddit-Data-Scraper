ISU's actual Human Resources office is on the 3rd floor of Rankin Hall. You might consider giving them a visit to speak directly to the horses' mouths about what kinds of things to expect, what the best approaches could be for someone new to the scene, etc. In fact, they might have some student position openings worth considering, that way you might be able to get some actual HR experience before graduation (which would be great for a resume). \n\n2.) I seem to remember someone who graduated with a degree in HR and they found work. Just understand that any degree, really, will be hard finding work through at first, especially for anyone without much experience. The best thing you can do starting out is get into either an internship or a student job to build a resume up. Network with people, pass out copies of your resume or business cards (if you have any), and just keep pushing forward like that until you finagle a job. Never stop applying to positions, too, and that includes through whatever websites you visit. Yeah, applying to positions from websites is a full time job of its own, but it has to be done to get anywhere.\n\n3.) Try to find a good professor to be mentored by. You don't have to be best friends but adding that extra effort into your studies has major return, especially if it's authentic effort (and not just utilitarian bullshit).",

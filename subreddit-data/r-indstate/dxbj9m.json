I\u2019m in it and I don\u2019t think I would go anywhere else. :)\n\nYou might have clinical on the weekend just an FYI. You might have a clinical shift from 7 am to 7 pm. Kaplan\u2019s are hard, but study. Supposedly, no more study guides are allowed in the nursing program next year. \n\nHowever, I enjoy it still even though I don\u2019t have a weekend \ud83d\ude05.",

They will rearrange whatever they need to help you however they can. We just got new labs that are wonderful for practicing skills before clinical! It is very time consuming, and your weekends are basically gone, but you will enjoy your clinical time.",

I have discovered the horror stories are only true to those who don\u2019t study, don\u2019t attend or pay attention in class, and are not prepared. Sure, you\u2019ll be overwhelmed at times, but if you study and work hard, you won\u2019t have a problem!",

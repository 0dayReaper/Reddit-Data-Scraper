Feel free to post here! \n\nIf your question is \"I have $10,000, what do I do?\" or other \"advice for my personal situation\" questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:\n\n* How old are you? What country do you live in?  \n* Are you employed/making income? How much?  \n* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)  \n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  \n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  \n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)  \n* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?  \n* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.  \n\nPlease consider consulting our FAQ first - https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/faq\nAnd our [side bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/about/sidebar) also has useful resources.  \n\nIf you are new to investing - please refer to Wiki - [Getting Started](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/gettingstarted/)\n\nThe reading list in the wiki has a list of books ranging from light reading to advanced topics depending on your knowledge level.

            "comment": "I know for bonds, some types like treasuries and municipals have tax-free interest on federal, state, or both.\n\n1. Do bond **funds** pay interest to shareholders, and is that also true for **ETFs** that track those bonds?\n2. If above is true, is interest from bond fund properly divided into taxable and nontaxable on the IRS tax return form brokerages send us? Is this also the same for ETFs?\n\nThanks. I feel like the answer is yes for all the above because stock mutual funds have dividends, but I haven't seen any answer on the internet actually say \"yes, bond funds deliver interest.\"",

See here - [https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099int](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099int)\n\n\\[edit\\] - I noticed in your question that you asked about ETFs. A bond fund could be organized as a mutual fund or ETF. The fund could be open-ended or closed-ended.  If the fund is organized as a '40 Act fund - it pays dividend interest.",

I feel like a fund being like 12% just two companies defeats the purpose of diversification a bit. Or is the best way to do this just to split the investment between VTI and a small cap fund? To be clear, I don't want to avoid large caps completely, I just want something more evenly weighted across the market.",

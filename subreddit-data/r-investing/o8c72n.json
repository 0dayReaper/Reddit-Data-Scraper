For a very long time the risk of addiction was not acknowledged, leading to bad decisions. There are still patients who need long term opiate prescriptions. Terminal illness is the best example (risk of addiction doesn't matter if your prognosis is less than a year). There are also patients who's pain can only be managed through opiates, and who would have such a lowered quality of life due to pain that the risk makes sense. \n\nThe new restrictions can hurt patients. I had to fight with my mom's pharmacy to get them to dispense her pain meds because they were regularly increasing in dose. They were prescribed by a palliative care physician because she had terminal cancer. The CDC recommends that opiate dosing for terminal patients only be restricted by how well the patient handles side effects, with no upper limit. Only after I identified myself as a paramedic did they say I counted as a 'home healthcare provider' and release her medication.",

Pharma companies also reward doctors who prescribe large amounts of their drugs, some with cash, others with trips and other perks. \n\nIf you want more details, I recommend the book \"Empire of Pain\" about Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family, written by Patick Radden Keefe.

I will purposefully go week+ long stints taking no meds and choosing to suffer just so I can give my liver and kidney a break. I come under my prescribed amount so often I go months without needing refills etc. That's how my doc knows I'm doing good and not abusing things.\n\nI have tried legal cannabis and every chronic pain med out there to no avail. Found I'm allergic to cannabis. CBD does nothing and I already have a bunch of allergies to analgesics like morphine and codeine etc. Take away oxycodone and you'd basically be putting a nail in my coffin because living every day feeling like your joints are ripping apart and your muscles spasm so bad you can't walk is no kind of life for anyone.",

Things like percocet combined with indomethacin make it manageable to push through a day. That combined with a particular diet and regular exercise can reduce symptoms significantly. Enough that after a year and a half off I went back to work. \n\nDocs think it's something related to genetics + diet but no clue what. If I follow a Whole30 diet plus exercise regularly I can get to a nearly pain free lifestyle and so long as I don't deviate and ever eat anything enjoyable like ice cream or have a hot dog or burger I'd probably be mostly fine. Was doing good until Covid came along. Since Covid hit it's been a bit of a roller coaster for me with eating healthy to avoid pain versus doing something that makes me happy but paying for it with pain. So it's all a trade off, one I couldn't do at all without pain medications that literally make it possible to function like a semi-normal human. The pendulum has definitely swung from over prescription to being looked at like a hard core street drug abuser. \n\nI have ended up in the ER and literally been accused of drug abuse and asked what kind of street drugs I take. Has happened twice, once after breaking my knee with my knee cap literally on the side of my leg and the second time after having my kidney removed due kidney cancer. Cause yeah I'm faking the pain with a busted knee and having just had an organ removed that was the size of a football. \ud83d\ude44 Thank god I had a regular doctor who could verify my drug allergies and force the issue of oxycodone and hydrocodone being the only drugs that actually work on me at all.\n\nIt's amazing how there is no middle ground for anyone.",

Just because pain is chronic does not mean it is not severe. What other options are there? Let's say you have arthritis everywhere, because you are super old. Do you think NSAIDs will be your solution? Ibuprofen is killing your stomach slowly. Just add PPIs on NSAIDS you say to protect the stomach? Well PPIs cause osteoporisis - especially difficult in elderly patients. Patients may then be cycled to opiods. A good doctor will try to cycle,  try alternative medicines that might help, and support patients in not getting addicted. And even if.. imagine you are 80 and everything hurts. Opioids are one of the greatest human inventions, but unfortunately unbelievable misused.I feel most here underestimate the gift of having your pain removed, till the day you have severe pain. Look at other countries using opiods in medical practice, but not having a crisis such as the US. For example, in Germany, after getting your widsdom teeth removed you'd never get opiods prescribed. It's resevered for those who really need it.",

My primary concern is if other pharma companies follow the direction of JNJ in the future. I don't think JNJ's decision by itself is that big of a deal, more so the climate around and reason for the decision. I also worry that this will contribute further to physician fear of prescribing opioids. This fear can be a good thing in the case of new prescribing of opiods, but when it leads to chronic pain patients being treated like addicts or having their pain meds yanked without a conversation (which happens a lot in my experience), it can lead to worsened quality of life and functioning.",

This is purely political and there are at least another dozen companies who make opioids and their popular genetic varieties.\n\nThe ones that SHOULD be paying enormous fines along with going to fucking jail is that lying sack of shit family the Sacklers from Perdue.\n\nDoctors will always be doctors and will do everything for the health of their patients on the oath of their profession. The difference is that today, Doctors aren\u2019t being lied to about the addictive qualities of the medication and told to prescribe for very vague reasons (not your situation).\n\nAlso, other countries have managed to treat some forms of chronic pain via rehab, therapy and counseling. Of course the intensity varies, and this is where opioids fill that gap, but it should have never been the be all end all solution in the form of a pill.\n\nPeople SHOULD try all other possible methods to treat their pain before resorting to opioids. The fact is, it\u2019s basically heroin. That\u2019s an indisputable fact in the sense of the dopamine release and sense of instant reward your brain and consequently body feel after taking the medication. \n\nPortugal had done it right and is a great example to the rest of the world, but to emulate that model, the US has to \u201cgrow up\u201d in terms of how it views addiction and treat people who are addicts as they treat a disease rather than looking at people as criminals.\n\nAlso, if you are in an illegal state, contact your Senator and tell him/her to support the MORE act when the bill drops. Federal legal Cannabis is more of a possibility than ever, and while it\u2019s not the optimal solution for everyone, it is another option for some.\n\nThere\u2019s an amazing HBO documentary on the opioid crisis and how Perdue essentially purposely fucked the entire country.",

Sucks that it inconveniences you, it also inconveniences me as well for the medication I need, but living here and seeing how much better things got after seeing the worst, makes me less selfish.\n\nIt sucks that you have to pay a co-pay and get time off work to get you medication, but that\u2019s part of the enormous problems we face as a nation in accessible, affordable health care. Part of the issue is that employment laws and benefits also vary by state. \n\nThe reality is, you shouldn\u2019t be under any financial burden (doesn\u2019t necessarily mean free health care) to the point that it\u2019s crippling you to pay bills and other things.",

This extremist gut reaction that says there won't be enough opioids for people that need them is completely incorrect and even dangerous. Opioids are good at relieving pain when managed correctly. The problem the last 30 years has been improper management of opioids. There are physicians that specialize in pain management. What will most likely happen, is that prescribing opioids will be limited to acute pain for X number of days, as some states have already mandated, and for chronic opioid use to be managed by a pain specialist. The pendulum is not swinging to one extreme or another, we finally know the dangers of these drugs and how to manage them.",

It's not the only one.    \"In 2012 twelve states had more opioid prescriptions than people\" \n\n\"One contributing factor behind the opioid epidemic is the increase in the use of prescription painkillers nationally. From 1991 to 2011, the number of opioid prescriptions dispensed by U.S. pharmacies tripled from 76 million to 219 million.\\[4\\] This increase in the use of opioids is unique to America. The United States represents less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population but consumes roughly 80 percent of the world\u2019s supply of opioid drugs.\\[5\\] There is also wide variation from one state to another in opioid-prescribing rates. In 2012 twelve states had more opioid prescriptions than people: Alabama (142.9 per 100 people), Tennessee (142.8), West Virginia (137.6), Kentucky (128.4), Oklahoma (127.8), Mississippi (120.3), Louisiana (118), Arkansas (115.8), Indiana (109.1), Michigan (107), South Carolina (101.8), and Ohio (100.1).\\[6\\]\"\n\nhttps://www.ncsc.org/trends/monthly-trends-articles/2017/opioid-epidemic-and-the-courts",

Never even really sold traditional opioids: had two abuse deterring products (patch and non crushable pill) and had a [part?] ownership in an (I believe) Australian plant that made API that sold to other pharmas which I think they exited years ago. Basically just dragged into this because they are the only big player with a decent balance sheet. There was supposed to be a settlement a while ago for the whole US that never got finalized so guess this indicates that this is probably going to keep trickling out over the coming years but the amount seems pretty reasonable given the scale NY represented in the opioid crisis. Think the last number I had plugged in for a settlement reserve was $5bn which I think was pretty onside to the street so this likely tracks well across the other States and small +",

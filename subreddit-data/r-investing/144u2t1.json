Some people say you shouldn\u2019t invest in the stock market if you\u2019ll need the money in less than five years, some say ten. But almost everyone will agree that if you\u2019ll need the money in less than two years, the stock market is far too risky.\n\nWith interest rates nearing five percent, I\u2019d actually argue that HYSAs are looking particularly appealing right now. That\u2019s where I\u2019d keep my money that I\u2019ll need within the next two years if I were you.",

Money spent on investments could detract from that if they aren't timed right for buying the house. I don't know OP, but if he is the type to give in to temptation for other things being very liquid could enable that. Being illiquid enforces discipline.\n\nAs for emergencies, whichever way OP goes I certainly hope he'll have enough for that in liquid funds. Beyond that rainy day fund he could be better served by a CD. That's not to say he necessarily should go with a CD. I'm not even saying you're wrong for suggesting the liquid option has merits, it certainly does.",

But extra net worth now and compounded over time in capital gains could be meaningful money for some quality of life things. He might be better served by having liquidity available, I don't mean to say he absolutely won't. Most people probably don't make a whole lot more on CDs than HYSAs, but they still use them because they perceive the extra money to be worth it when they don't need the liquidity, and if anything, it probably helps them stay disciplined and resist impulses.",

We have existing accounts with them and I know the timing for getting money out.  I've moved lots of money through them so I'm not worried about gotchas or other last-minute issues.  Some HYSA accounts have transfer limits and other idiosyncrasies.\n\n  Its not the only reason for the decision, but another point in their favor.",

The rate is locked at the date of the transaction.\n\nSo for example of I buy a 4 week T bill for $10k at 5%, they'll take out $9961 (10,000/(1+.05/13), and deposit $10k in 4 weeks.\n\nThere are different lengths from 4 weeks to 52 weeks. There are specific sale schedules, ie there are specific immovable dates that the transactions happen on regardless of when you put the purchase in, so that can be a catch when planning to have your money liquid. Also important to note, the rate is locked when they take your money, not when you schedule the transaction.\n\nI guess the only risk is the US tanking, but at that point, what's US dollar anyhow?",

You don\u2019t have to use Vanguard as a broker, and I wouldn\u2019t because their interface is pretty bad.

Make sure youre account is one of the best available, at least 4.5% \n\nYou could absolutely put it into an ETF or stocks. Just keep in mind you may lose more that way.\n\nI put my savings for a home purchase into the market when I was in a similar situation. I lost ~ 10% of my savings as I bought right in the COVID crash. At least it's a tax write off, but that only softens the blow \n\nThat said, I'd do it again. I'd take that risk for the potential gains above inflation that pretty much only the market can provide. \n\nMy take: go for it just understand the risks. The important thing is that you are putting money away for it. The how is less important.\n\nOne more thing. If you are starting to look don't use a CD or bonds. Would suck to have to not buy the perfect house because your wealth is illiquid.",

            "comment": "People will likely disagree with this approach, but if I\u2019m saving cash for something, I usually leave it in my Fidelity trading account as cash. \n\nFidelity does automatic investments of your cash with various other banks and pays you interest on your cash on a monthly basis. It\u2019s not the best interest rate in town (right now it looks like I\u2019m earning about 3% APR), but it\u2019s significantly better than a checking/savings account. \n\nThe upside is that it\u2019s extremely liquid - both in terms of moving it to another bank super quickly, but also if I want to invest it in something, it\u2019s right there. For example, if I know I won\u2019t need it for a few months, I can put it in a T Bill. \n\nFor me it\u2019s the best balance of all options - extreme liquidity (both in terms of cashing out or opting to invest in something else instead), decent (but not the best) automatic monthly interest, and FDIC insured. \n\nThink of it this way: for each $10k you want in cash, you could lock it into a CD or T Bill for about a 5% return on investment, with some overhead (in terms of time or cost) if you want to get the cash out early. Call it +$500 for the year on $10k. This Fidelity system is easier to manage (for me anyway) and will earn about +$300 over the same time period (assuming I just leave it there as cash and do not hit with it). The lost upside of $200/year on $10k is totally worth it to me for the convenience of not having to worry about it, and also having cash in the account if I want to make any quick investments.",

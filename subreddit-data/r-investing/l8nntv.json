    "postText": "Honestly, I didn\u2019t want to post this myself since there\u2019s probably two dozen of these posts in the queue, but all of the recent ones look like they\u2019re written by 8 year olds. \n\nNormally this belongs in the daily advice thread, but because of recent events and concerns over Robinhood\u2019s ability to serve customer(I been telling y\u2019all for years) we can have a thread in it\n\n\nSo here we are: recommend and discuss brokers, fees, features, mobile apps, whatever.  In general I think everyone is best served by Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard.  TD is another major player but for those unaware they are in the process of being acquired by schwab.  All three of those actually have phone numbers where you can call and speak to a person about your account.\n\nFor the younger crowd; a phone call is similar to voice to text, but instantaneous. \n\nAlso, feel free to chat apps or whatever too,\n\nE: [here is an overview of what happened with Robinhood](https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7t4pg/an_explanation_of_why_robinhoodapp_nonnefariously/).  No conspiracy theories or anything included, just a technical explanation. \n\nAlso, [my comment and subsequent conversation around liquidity concerns at Robinhood](https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/_/gl88dzj/?context=1)\n\nPlease note - I don\u2019t have any special insight here, this is strictly my and others interpretation of the tea leaves.  Feel free to discuss, and explore other interpretations.  Whatever broker choice you make is up to you, the important thing is that it is an educated choice since it\u2019s ultimately your money. \n\n\n\n#**No referral codes. Posting a referral code will result in an immediate no questions asked permanent ban** \n\nThanks.",

Some saying they did restrict, others saying they didn't. [They did at least restrict market orders](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l8nntv/comment/glgkpqh). Best to be safe.\n\n* Stake -- extremely harsh restrictions on buys, making them very difficult to safely and correctly execute\n\n* Alpaca -- [used to use APEX, but not anymore](https://i.imgur.com/AnJBH74.png)\n\n* ~~Freetrade~~ -- their FX provider &amp; bank have disabled US buy orders [link](https://imgur.com/a/6GjPi9n)\n\n* ~~Saxo Bank~~ -- getting conflicting reports, so take this one with a grain of salt.\n\n* ~~Trading212~~ -- restricted by their intermediary, Interactive Brokers\n\n* ~~Ally Financial~~ -- blamed their clearing firm, APEX, [users reporting other issues with Ally](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l8nntv/by_popular_demand_official_i_hate_robinhood_and/glhtkab/)\n\n* ~~Stockpile~~ -- clears all trades through APEX\n\n* ~~Public.com~~ -- blamed their clearing firm, APEX\n\n* ~~Webull~~ -- blamed their clearing firm, APEX\n\n* ~~SoFI~~ -- blamed their clearing firm, APEX\n\n* ~~Stash~~ -- blamed their clearing firm, APEX\n\n* ~~Tastyworks~~ -- blamed their clearing firm, APEX\n\n* ~~M1~~ -- blamed their clearing firm, APEX\n\nCrossed out brokers means they were ordered to stop permitting new positions in the meme stocks -- it wasn't necessarily a decision that they were happy to comply with, but they were strong-armed into it.\n\nHere are the brokers that **DIDN'T** restrict trading (these are the good guys):\n\n* Fidelity\n\n* Vanguard\n\n* Charles Schwab -- had maintenance probs first 30 min of trading Thurs, across ALL stocks... Did NOT restrict\n\n* JP Morgan You Invest\n\n* Trade Station\n\n* Questrade\n\n* TradeZero -- apparently even told their clearing firm to fuck off when asked to restrict new positions.

You get around just fine, but even then, it takes more than it should. \n\nI just downloaded the Vanguard Beacon app. It's not bad. But just like the website, it needs some work. If they revamp the site and the app, they could indeed eat the competition alive. And I hope that they do.

Ironic that in an effort to screw over the rich people people are leaving the smaller companies for the big ones everyone has heard of.  This will continue the trend of more regulations so next time more small companies who can't keep up go out of business in favor of the bigger ones.",

I also use Webull but only for not serious day trading and tinkering with 4am orders since they open the earliest.\n\nThe only thing TD did was limit GME, AMC, BB purchase on margin but you can buy all you want with your money.  They also didn't do it all suddenly like a coordinated attack but slowly reducing margin buys on risky stocks over time.  Also they've always had more strict margins on any stock that is extremely risky.  \n\nIf it looses value they have to worry about collecting the debt from their users on margin.  But they will allow you to gain or lose with your own money.",

Another, more mischievous way, would be if we all just kept minimum balances in RH and use their UI and servers, but do all actual trades on other platforms.",

In addition all of the other mods are also working professionals- this helps us determine what is and what is not good investment discussion but it means our time is limited.  Each call for more mods has been met with pretty lackluster responses - so automod is really the only way to not just end up being a free for all.\n\nThe other problem is traffic spikes significantly during times like this, so we end up with a lot of trash and people who don\u2019t bother reading rules.

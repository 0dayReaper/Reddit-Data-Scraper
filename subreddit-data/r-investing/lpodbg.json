If they can keep beating the market year over year then it's special but other than buffett and lynch pretty much every manager has eventually been brought back to earth by reverting to the mean.\n\nConsider a thought experiment: you get one million monkeys that throw darts at a market weighted(so area on board is equal to share of market) board to pick stocks. Consider that they just pick randomly, they should be ON AVERAGE returning exactly the market.\n\nNow among those monkeys, a load of them will make more than the market one year, and another bunch make less. The next year, some of them will make less, and others more and there will be fewer big winners but there'll still be some. And so it goes on until 20 years later even from 1 million monkeys, none remain that have made consistent big returns. Because of course monkeys don't know shit about stocks.\n\nWould you really celebrate the monkeys that won big on pure luck for the first 5 years?",

I believe I read about a scam (of sorts) where a broker would send out flyers to say 100,000 people, telling half the market would go up this week and telling the other half it would go down.  And then each week following up with a similar flyer arrangement to the group that received the correct prediction.  By random chance, a group of a few thousand people will receive 100% accurate \"predictions\" of the market week after week and will be likely to invest a large sum of money with no true basis.",

Well I never.\n\nOn a more serious note though I do think there may be some space for skill in the stock market but since it takes so long to measure it\u2019s near useless. Also fund managers are actively handicapped by the size of their holdings. If an average investor wants to invest in something they buy maybe a few tens of thousands of that stock. Their action does Nothing. When a fund wants to buy something they could be looking at buying many millions and their purchases and sales can drive up and down prices and not in a way that\u2019s favorable to them.\n\nBasically these two factors plus the cost make the prospect of using an actively managed fund anathema to myself. Perhaps arkk really is different. But it\u2019s yet to stand the test of time and once it has I suppose it will be too late. I\u2019m not a greedy man though so I\u2019m quite happy to just take what I can get from low cost indexes",

The story comes from Malkiel's \"random walk down wall street\" which was quite popular for some time, unfortunately the science behind it was literally nothing more than surface level \"thought experiments\" and analogies.  Once we began actually observing the data we learned that not only is this sentiment unfounded, it's quite literally the opposite of reality.\n\nRead this: http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s6558.pdf\n\n\nIn general, when one uses an analogy to establish a position on something that contains hard data you should immediately be suspicious of the statement.  The only reason to use analogies and cute stories in the absence of measuring data would be to fool the reader, and in this case it would seem many people are quite open to being fooled.",

The often-cited statistics from Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Index in regard to hedge fund performance is revealing.\n\ufeff\n&gt; From January 1994 to October 2018\u2014through both bull and bear markets\u2014the passive S&amp;P 500 Index outperformed every major hedge fund strategy by about 2.25% in annualized return. But particular strategies performed very differently. For example, between 1994 and 2009, dedicated short strategies suffered badly, but market neutral strategies outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index in risk-adjusted terms (i.e. underperformed in annualized return but incurred less than one-fourth the risk).\n\n&gt; If your market outlook is bullish, you will need a specific reason to expect a hedge fund to beat the index. Conversely, if your outlook is bearish, hedge funds should be an attractive asset class compared to buy-and-hold or long-only mutual funds. Looking at the period up to October 2018, we can see that the Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Index lags behind the S&amp;P 500 with a net average annual performance of 7.53% versus 9.81% for the S&amp;P 500 (since January 1994).",

            "comment": "\"These managers made bank\"\n\n\\-- but speaking of hedge fund managers generally, they don't.\n\nHedge funds reliably trail the indices, often by large amounts. There are a very few managers who appear to be able to generate any meaningful risk adjusted returns, and the trouble is that from year to year it's hard to know which ones. A very few managers at the top of the league table appear to produce genuinely good excess performance, but it's remarkably opaque. Take the  story of Renaissance -- their Medallion fund, which apparently has produced fantastic performance for years, well you can't invest it in it, its principals only. The Renaissance funds which actually are open to outside investors-- have produced pretty mediocre returns . . . so you have to ask \"what's going on here?\" Why is the performance of the funds that we can see so much worse than the performance of the funds we can't see?\n\nA reasonable hypothesis: With tens of thousands of investment managers, just by luck, some will produce tremendous outperformance, particularly using lots of leverage. As a result, there will be some dramatic stories of big winners, folks who will then take princely fees for what seems as likely to be luck as any actual advantage.\n\nNote, too, that many of these managers have several different funds-- you'll see cherry picked selection of one particular high performing fund, neglecting the fact that other funds from the same manager may have performed very badly.\n\nSee Burton Malkiel's [\"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street), in its umpteenth edition of exploding the myths of stock picking and predictable risk adjusted outperformance\n\nA reasonable hypothesis is that what hedge funds are actually about is convincing people to invest in their fund, levering it up, placing a bet of one kind or another, and then taking fees from performance of other people's money.  This is a bit like \"heads I take 2 and 20, tails you lose\"  . . . a great bet if you can convince someone take that bet. It's a bit like convincing your partners to stake you at roulette for a portion of your winnings-- a great deal for the manager, but as an investor, is this a good bet for \\_you\\_?",

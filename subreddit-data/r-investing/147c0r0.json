How is it possible that market goes on huge run in last few years but also the money market funds?  \n5.8 trillion ? https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MMMFFAQ027S  \nWhat does it mean for a correction for the market if it eventually comes? Does it mean the correction will be less or short lived, because the money markets will rotate into stocks during a correction?",

            "comment": "The flood into money market funds is also the effect of all the idle cash that was just sitting in bank accounts. Due to the sharp increase in interest rates a lot of the cash simply moved to money markets because a better savings rates could be achieved. When interest rates were near zero most people didn't care to buy money market funds for the puny addition returns. The term that you can look up and read about is called cash sorting. So from that perspective I think those headlines are a bit misleading.\n\nThat being said a lot of cash built up during the pandemic so while I do think that having that 5.8 trillion dry powder could soften a correction assuming that the cash is opportunistically invested, there's probably a lot of it that is just cash needed to be stored in a safe place and not available for re-investment into the stock market. I'm thinking corporations and business' that hold short term reserves etc. Would be interesting to see the breakdown of the 5.8 trillion.",

There was no real incentive to use them over a retail deposit account. When the yield curve univerts, it will go back to normal. \n\nBy what metric are you referring to the market being overvalued? The S&amp;P PE seems in line with the current interest rates.",

It was perhaps the right thing to do with the information on hand in 2020. \n\n\nProblem is, the market just found a way to adapt and all that money needed to go somewhere. We saw things like real estate and digital currencies explode in value. People felt better off and got used to it. No student loan payments, free government money, low unemployment, and banks were trying to give away money because their deposits were growing too fast. Of course assets will inflate. Printing 20% of all USD ever created as a response to the pandemic is basically guaranteed to cause issues down the road.\n\n\nI'm staying long equities for now because I thought the crash should have hit already, proving that I can't predict a bottom. Logic says there has to be a correction. Selling tech or loading up on energy last October when the market was \"overvalued\" were both mistakes though. \n\n\nI know the Fed wants to erase money out of the supply chain. When it does so, it is politically unpopular to a large degree. With Congress passing new spending bills to give people more money to fight inflation (lol), I fear we are living in times of a giant financial experiment and I don't like being the test subject.",

Likely the Fed would raise rates to prevent that expansion of the money supply. \n\nFor municipal money markets states would see increased short term borrowing costs, likely turning to banks and then longer term bonds.  That would push up money market yields and then correct very slightly and slowly push up everything else to keep municipals in line.\n\nFor corporate money markets they would shift quickly to 1-3 year debt. Spreads might widen a bit. \n\nMostly I don't think too much impact.  \n\nIn terms of the USA stock market it is worth over $46t.

All that money is just Boomer retirement accounts being spent down on gas for RVs, ocean cruises, BBCs in Jamaica, etc. It's Japan 2.0. Stagflation for 30 years with an ageing population. \n\nThere are plenty of ways to fight inflation that don't involve crashing the economy via rate hikes and trade wars but that's what corporations want so that's what we get. As far as money markets rotating into stocks, it's just a function of hedge funds rebalancing. Since Boomers have all the money that means they will be heavy on bonds and light on stocks so you should see continual downward pressure on stocks and even more so as consumer sentiment goes down with falling house prices and inflation.",

So whilst technically the dollar in and dollar out is indeed equal, in reality this is not true. You can put in 10000$ , someone else puts in 5000$ and you sell for 5000$ but you still can have 10000$ in the market because valuations appreciated from the money in flow. It now looks like 15000$. Its only if everyone sells everything that it becomes a zero sum game... Which it still doesn't in the long run since companies make profits so you'll always get more out than was put in. Stock buybacks, dividends, accumulation of tangible assets, etc. And then you also have inflation pushing nominal valuations higher. The amount of money on the sidelines therefore absolutely matters. But what matters more is what people think. If everyone was convinced that the sp500 would be at 23000 at the end of the year, then nobody would sell under 23000 minus the time value of money and therefore it would only take one person and a few dozen dollars to buy a fraction of sp500 shares to move it from the current price to 23000.",

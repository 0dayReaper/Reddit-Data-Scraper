    "postText": "Hi everyone,\r  \n\r  \nI own some obscure ETFs which have semi-annual dividends that have been historically distributed in June. For tax reasons, it is better for me to sell them before the ex-dividend date and then buy them again afterwards.\r  \n\r  \nI have already spent like 4 hours looking through the prospectus and KIID information and still haven't found anything. Am I doing something wrong? How could this be so difficult to find?\r  \n\r  \nWhere would you recommend me to look?\r  \n\r  \nThis is one of the ETFs: [iShares \u20ac Govt Bond 20yr Target Duration UCITS ETF](https://www.ishares.com/uk/professional/en/products/272122/)\r  \n\r  \nThank you.",

            "comment": "What tax loop hole are you exactly trying to take advantage of?  The dividend will reduce the value of the fund.  If you hold the fund and take the dividend, you'll have to pay taxes on the dividend.  If you sell all your holdings before the dividend and buy it back after the dividend, you'll have to pay any gains on the entirety of what you sold, which presumably is more than the dividend.",

However, once the dividend is distributed, you will be taxed on that income no matter what.\r  \n\r  \nConsequently, even if you still want to own the ETF, it is better to sell the shares prior to the ex-dividend date and buy them afterward, thereby allowing for potential tax optimization rather than locking in **certain** taxes on the dividends.",

You can offset gains with losses, unless you hit a wash sale.  In which case the losses are deferred until you incur another loss that is not washed.  Selling at a loss before the ex-dividend date and buying back after it is absolutely a wash sale and you will not be able to claim those losses unless other unwashed losses are incurred.",

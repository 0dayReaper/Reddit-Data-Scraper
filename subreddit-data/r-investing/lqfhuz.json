    "postText": "A friend just messaged me saying that his portfolio lost 10% of its value recently and that this was complete doomsday. Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it's frustrating.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:\n\n* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.\n* S&amp;P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.\n* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.\n\nWhich one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&amp;P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.\n\nIf you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're \"overvalued\". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.\n\nVolatility is the price you pay for your returns.\n\nIf you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.\n\nSo here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with \"I own XYZ because...\". Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can't tell that story, sell it off. It doesn't belong in your portfolio. Free up that cash so you can pile in when spectacular opportunities arise in future.",

Primarily agtc and ctxr. Both of these are down hard for me right now but honestly, they\u2019re the things I have most faith in and would really recommend anyone look into them. Them being cheaper now means I can consolidate into them and it makes me optimistic",

Stocks have the stock market, bonds have the bond market.\n\nYields are going up because inflation is going up. If you are buying debt, and inflation is rising faster than the interest rate, then you're essentially _paying_ the borrower for access to your money. So bond buyers are demanding higher interest rates right now, causing yields to increase as well.\n\nThen your super safe index investor begins to look at historically high bond yields compared to SPY and it's risks, and decides to invest in bond indexes. This outflow causes SPY and it's components to go lower. Someone that was invested in TSLA will look at how low SPY is and it's relative security, and invest into that. This will lower the price of TSLA, making it attractive to the CCIV holder, etc. \n\nThe whole thing is a feedback loop because this shift into bonds really does make stocks go down, _and_ at the same time feel more risky, causing people to but \"safe\" bonds. This continues until inflation or interest rates go down, stocks go back up, or bonds become overbought, at which point the whole dance happens in reverse.",

Don\u2019t invest all your money at once. Save some for a pull back at least 10% then buy more to average down. If your young you have plenty of years to make up losses and gain profit. You will never get rich putting money in the bank. You want to be the bank. Stop looking at stocks every day. It will drive you nuts",

They bring potential opportunities and they bring truth/clarity. What I mean by the second part is if you look at your portfolio and you go name by name as OP suggested, and you come to a name and your first instinct is to sell it, then if you thought you believed in it in the first place perhaps not as much as you thought you did. Get something in that spot where your first reaction in a correction isn't going to be to dump it. If you're way too heavily speculative growth and thought that was great when it was going up every day but now that it isn't it doesn't seem like as good of an idea, then gradually make some changes.",

If you've been actively trading a bit lately, or have cash from options, savings, inheritance, etc. It's a good time to set a purchase strategy to buy periodically on the way down (and up).\n\nSet a horizon, set some value upper and lower limits, pick stocks or better yet use dumb ETFs, and buy on a schedule. You will average the upcoming correction, which is the next best thing to timing the bottom (which is impossible except by sheer luck or insider info for select stocks, or insider info on government/fed actions, etc., but impossible for the whole market and without that info).\n\nOne of the dumbest strategies is to simply say buy in $10,000 over the next 2 years, and buy every month on a random date (use a random number generator). There are much more smart ways of buying based on how much the stock has decreased from ATH, etc., but the difference in what you earn may be minimal or it may even perform worse than RNG buying via cost-averaging.\n\nIf you think the market will be bear for the next X months/years, as long as you don't set X too short, you are guaranteed to get a good cost basis for your stocks if you randomly purchase regular amounts with some interval over the next X time.\n\nThe biggest risk is underestimating X and buying in too much too early^(1). A secondary risk is over-estimating X too much, and having money sit out of the market for too long (opportunity cost)^(2). But the latter is overstates for the average retail investor as long as you are not setting X to be 5+ years and keeping cash floating for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n^(1) If you set X to be 2 months, but the brunt of the slowdown starts next year, you end up buying in near ATH. *With this risk, you can lose money you own.*\n\n^(2) If you set X to be 3 years, but market correction lasts 4 months, then for 20 months you're buying on the way up and are missing out on gains. *With this risk, you lose money you could have earned.*\n\nYou don't know X a priori but at the same time it's possible to set reasonable values and considering value since ATH as an additional metric to constrain it and buy on the way down and up. Once you return to ATH in the future (not within a few days/weeks, thats susceptible to volatility), you can simply go all in with the remaining money, to avoid opportunity cost based loss (make sure market indicators are predicting a stable/bull market when you do so).",

You think that it doesn't matter because nobody cares about fundamentals but when push comes to shove the company which is actually producing something will retain most of the value.\n\nBtw.... I would not panic much yet, the next wave of stimulus checks is on the way and mark my words, we will see the market reaching new high soon.\n\n\ud83d\ude02",

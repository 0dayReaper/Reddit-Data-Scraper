    "postText": "Title says it all.\n\nTesla's earnings in the first quarter were $438 million.\n\n$101 million (23%) of that came from selling Bitcoin for profit.\n\nThe other interesting part is that it would have been an earnings miss without the trading.\n\nDid one make the other happen?\n\nConsidering the recent news about not allowing Bitcoin anymore, it's certainly a move worth mentioning.\n\nAs highlighted by Scott Galloway: https://twitter.com/profgalloway/status/1393232146681286664",

If you know that you\u2019re getting regulatory credits, Bitcoin sales, tax loss credits, etc then you can spend more in a quarter while still managing your earnings to long term goals or market expectations (whatever you care about more). \n\nPeople who keep saying \u201cthey only made earnings due to XX\u201d don\u2019t seem to understand how earnings management works. It\u2019s like saying Volkswagen only got that EPS because of XX product\u2026 well yeah that was a contributing factor, just like all of the other products/contributions which the CFO would be aware of. \n\nAll these companies have CAPEX/OPEX/Spending Plans which take into account all their expectations for upcoming quarters/years to the best of their ability.",

The total 12-month revenue that comes from a full production factory is $2.5B (250K cars/year). In other words for every $1 investment into a new factory, the company will generate $2.5/yr in revenue.](https://ritholtz.com/2021/01/transcript-ron-baron/) From 2022 to 2025 expect massive growth in the company's revenue.

They'd probably still be profitable because of how ridiculous his comp is. But they are growing rapidly so you expect high amounts of R&amp;D and capex.\n\nAny way you cut it, until fsd and more non-auto business lines ramp up, the company is over valued.

I can understand a company like SQ or Paypal or even a big bank going into crypto but a car company??\n\nSeems to me, they got caught up in the hype and wanted to generate any buzz they can.   The profits from crypto amounted to peanuts and all they got was extra publicity.  Maybe that was the purpose, to get people talking about Tesla.",

If any of them fail, say solar panels, then the stock is way too high.\n\nThe other problem is that the high stock price will require them to expand their other products much quicker than they probably wanted to/should. This might lead to quality control issues or inefficiency issues, etc. In my opinion, there is just too much on their plate to be ultra successful in all of them.",

Excluding credits.\n\nAnd credits are a direct result of producing cars. They won't go away any time soon.\n\nOn the other hand, you have one-time expenses such as Musk's compensation plan and the expenses related to the S/X refresh. If you ignore those like you want to ignore recurring revenue, they are even more profitable.\n\nSo you seem to be cherry-picking only what you need to, in order to make sure it fits you narrative.",

Ohh you have to deal with unions while laying off ICE workers. Tesla has none of that. They will likely gain a larger share faster than anyone meaning they can be the low cost provider. Long term, the car will be peanuts, the value will be in subscriptions to self driving (which admittedly everyone still has to prove).

Also Tesla does not run a utility.\n\nElon also assured everyone that there will be over a million robotaxis on the roads by mid 2020 and we are not even close. Fully self driving cars are at least a decade away when you consider legal and regulatory issues they face. Do you think lawmakers in the US and abroad are going to let Teslas operate on public roads freely without a driver? How much legislation needs to be passed before the legality of that is defined. For example when a fully autonomous car hits and kills a pedestrian, who is liable? The car owner or Tesla? They won't allow robo-cars on the road until they can figure all that out and if you think that will be done in the next 5 years, I would say you are being overly optimistic.\n\nTesla has has failed to deliver on their other avenues for revenue growth so until they can prove they can, I wouldn't be so optimistic on their prospects.",

It is a hype company\n\nI keep hearing that, and yet it seems weird when they are actually delivering real growth.\n\n&gt;and will start to really feel the effect once all the major car companies start pushing out EVs in 2023 and beyond\n\nIt's always some time in the future, isn't it? Yes, we've heard it all before.\n\nThe problem is, by 2023, Tesla will be selling the $25k compact. And they will have their new and much cheaper and better batteries which everyone else won't be able to use. And they won't stand still in general. You seem to be assuming that Tesla will be  doing nothing and make it easy to catch up with them.",

Nobody is making the numbers of cars or has the equivalent battery technology. I could probably be convinced it's a company that's poorly run but you can't deny their tech is legit.\n\nEdit: I'm not an Elon fanboy although I do drive a Tesla.",

A company doesn't make a bunch of money to cover costs and then makes a little more to be profitable. They make a bunch of money, and then we see if it covers costs or not.\n\nTesla made $8.7 billion from their main business of selling cars (so, ignoring leases, energy, other services, etc.) Increasing or decreasing that by $100 million isn't really significant, it's around 1%, tiny changes in things like cost of raw materials will have a bigger effect than that.\n\nFor most quarters, ignoring stuff like credits (and bitcoin this past quarter) Tesla would almost exactly break even. And then they make a small profit from these extraneous items. It seems pretty clear that they're trying to grow as quickly as possible while also controlling costs, and their goal ends up being right around a GAAP profit of 0 or small losses.\n\nIn terms of cash generation they're doing a fantastic job and they're growing sales and revenues and margins extremely well. No company in their position should be holding back growth to try and squeak out a bigger profit every quarter.",

Say a company made $100 revenue had total $90 costs and made $10 income. Let's now say $1 of that revenue was from interest income. That $1 is only 1% of their actual total earnings and probably not significant in terms of the company's day to day operations. But if you say % of profits it distorts the entire picture because all of a sudden it's 10% of profits and it seems like earning interest is a big part of what they do when it's really not. Every other $99 of that $100 revenue also contributed to that $10 profit. In fact you can probably make literally anything on the income statement seem material if you put it in terms of profits.",

Right now Tesla is seen as a luxury or luxury-lite brand. If they produce too many cars a year they will lose that perception and have to compete on function with other (likely better) car manufacturers. \n\nTesla's numbers are currently comparable to Jaguar and Range Rover. Both of those brands also have an exclusivity around them that if they sell to many vehicles by lowering prices and luxury amenities they will lose. Being Jaguar or Range Rover is not bad both companies do well especially in good markets where people are willing to buy their cars for the status symbol they are. \n\nValuing Tesla higher than all other automotive companies combined is clearly unrealistic.",

            "comment": "Way too much black and white thinking here... Love or hate Musk, Tesla is absolutely not worthless or a scam, just slightly overvalued. The tech truly is revolutionary, we just have to make sure our excitement matches the real world circumstances. I think Musk is using his influence to manipulate crypto market and I think that\u2019s really convenient when his company holds a ton of Bitcoin (I think he does personally as well).\n\nI don\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t think this matters. Factor out the Bitcoin sale and the regulatory credits, and once you look past the headlines of \u201cTesla profit\u201d and \u201cBitcoin sale for big company wow\u201d you\u2019re seeing what money was made from actually selling cars and you see it didn\u2019t change much from the past. \n\nDoes that mean Tesla is a fraud or won\u2019t grow more? Of course not... There are many reasons to believe Tesla will succeed for many years to come, and auto industry is low margin and very capital intensive.",

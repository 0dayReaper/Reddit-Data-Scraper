Linux can run on anything, and even Windows is finally starting to handle hardware in a sane manner (Try unplugging your keyboard and plugging it in to a different USB port in any Windows before 10). So to answer your second question: *No*. Operating systems are already modular enough to handle major hardware changes on the fly. \n\nThe first question is the problem. Neither Microsoft nor Apple really give a shit. There have been a few interesting tech demos and products that have been released, but no company has gone all in on it, because it would be **incredibly** difficult. Phone hardware, while very good, has some pretty serious thermal and electrical limits to what you can throw at it. This means that whatever software is running on the phone would have to be extremely efficient, and on top of that would have to run two completely different UIs simultaneously.\n\nThat point is why it's not gonna happen any time soon. No matter how hard people try, you cannot unify a small touch screen interface with an interface designed with a large screen and Keyboard+Mouse. Like it or not, KB+M is way more efficient and accurate than swiping with your finger. Because of that, the two UI styles are, by nature, incredibly different. And that difference means you need two different teams working on both UIs, and developers cost a lot of money.\n\nAll for a product maybe 1,000-10,000 people would buy for &lt;$1k.  The only way you're gonna see this happen is if someone writes software to do this on a Librem 5 (or any phone that runs mainstream Linux like PostmarketOS) in their spare time. And even then, it's not going to be pretty because running a display via a USB port is not going to work that well. It requires some pretty special hardware to put out that much bandwidth that reliably.",

IPhones were never that much better (if they were even better at all) than the competition but sold at a premium because people were willing to pay partially for the stickiness but mostly for the brand. \n\nChina's not brand sensitive (as a population they gladly buy knock-off anything), but there is a legitimate worry that Western users may stop seeing Apple as a fashionable brand that's worth the premium charged for the products. Apple's strategy was always on a thin wire in this respect, so I wonder how the sentiment in China may affect the sentiment in the West.",

The base OS is, there's no debating that. However, all the things that go into the ecosystem as a whole are pretty tightly controlled (primarily by Google).  \n\nI'm a a fan of the android  ecosystem  (have an S8, likely getting an s10, or some other new revision when it dies),but to continue calling it open source is borderline intellectual dishonesty.   It's more akin to Ford vs. Chevy, or maybe Ford vs. Mercedes. The open nature of the ecosystem invites more customization, where iOS  is really locked down ( similar to a new BMW / Mercedes ) wonderful handling and decent performance, but you pay for it in everything.\n\n\n\n",

It runs Overwatch, Doom 2016 and just about anything else perfectly fine, as well as handling all my audio and video editing needs and more (compiling programs, encrypting stuff &amp; rendering are all quite snappy).  The screen is large enough - and the built in speakers loud enough - that it's even serviceable for several casual multiplayer games (and of course tv/movies).\n\nOnly downside is that it's a little bulky and heavy, but some extra exercise is good and for my needs I would never dream of trading it for any iPhone currently on the market.  I have a slightly older, higher end Android I really like that currently sells for ~$150 used and I will stay on this model as long as I can.  [I can also access the file system over USB from most computers, and sideload software on it if I want, which is just... how it should be for someone like me.]  The value comparison, the 'bang for my buck' is pretty much beyond ridiculous at this point, for the same money that it would take for me to buy the newest, 'best' iPhone.\n\nI owned several iPhones and loved them at first (as well as having an appreciation for their Macs from way back), but I don't miss Apple, their walled garden or their prices one bit now.  It seems to me like their best hope is somehow providing a better virtual assistant experience or something like that-- but there is a ton of competition in any direction you can think of for them to go, and they will have to pull out their original spirit of breathtaking innovation again to regain allure in my eyes.",

I saw an article via google search that it\u2019s no longer sold now. (Not sure)\n\nI meant more like it becomes an important part of the line-up and the budget nature of the phone/device is highlighted rather then any innovation. \n\nBlackberry started coming out with \u201cbudget\u201d devices in an attempt to broaden market share.  But, I think that just further distracted them from the threat from Apple.  \n\nThe real issue is that Tim Cook needs to NOT be afraid of cannibalizing existing sales by an innovative product.  For example iPod was a huge hit before iPhone, but iPhone was an obvious replacement for the iPod. They still went forward despite that threat of it killing a cash cow.  That\u2019s how they need to continue to operate. ",

Not every leap-forward is surface level bells and whistles (although a low-bezel LCD isn't easy). It's internals, it's performance, it's battery life. How about the fact Apple dominates the 1st and 2nd place records for SoC performance, with the A12X nearly besting a 2018 i7? That's legit laptop level performance with about a 6th the power draw. Do you understand how many doors a processor, with that much efficient power, can open? Multi-day long laptops, desktop computational performance in every day objects. They are literally crushing the competition in this regard. \n\nIt just feels like r/technology leaps into here any chance there's an opportunity to bash their two least favorite companies, Apple and Facebook. Their armchair analysis is useless and basically just takes one points that helps their narrative and blows it up beyond it's actual impact. ",

    "postText": "This isn\u2019t a brag post or anything, I\u2019m a stranger on the internet. Just genuinely looking for opinions.\n\nI currently own a home in a HCOL area. Conservatively, equity is 300k (after factoring in selling expenses, which are very high). My mortgage is just over 550k at 3.5% fixed.\n\nI have 25k in HYSA and 160k in broad-market ETFs. No other liquid assets.\n\nIm going to be moving to a different city in a few years, and I\u2019d like to buy a \u201cforever home\u201d at that point. Current income is 240k/year\u2014assume it stays the same and doesn\u2019t go up.\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards selling my current home and buying. I know the mortgage is a good deal and it\u2019s tempting to rent it out, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford any place that I\u2019d be willing to move in to in the new city, which is also HCOL.\n\nMy main questions are: how should I invest my excess income from now on? Keep DCA into funds? Or start putting most of it into HYSA for moving expenses/buying costs?\n\nAlso, assuming I can scrape together a 500k down payment in 2 years, what\u2019s a reasonable home price? 2 million would mean a 25% down payment, but a 1.5 million mortgage sounds insane.",

Put the cash in a money market fund like VMFXX while you wait. If you can\u2019t pay cash then get a mortgage for the difference and pay it off fast unless interest rates are low again in 3 years.     \n\nI know home ownership is a sacred dogma in america, but you should also run the numbers on renting vs buying and see if it actually makes sense. Watch rent vs buy videos by Ben Felix and Humphrey Yang on YouTube.",

The current rate coupled with the stability made it seem the logical candidate for a home purchase in the next couple of years.  \n\nI knew if I kept with the DCA method I\u2019d be more likely to have some bias or hesitancy around timing. \n\nI briefly considered other types of funds or vehicles but at the HYSA rates I feel pretty sanguine on not over complicating this one. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

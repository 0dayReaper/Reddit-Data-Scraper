    "postText": "Hello,\n\nFollowing the advice from a financial advisor, I started a Treasury Bill ladder with about $150k, by investing in Treasury Bills in three months increments at $50k each.\n\nThe concept of a Treasury Bill makes sense to me. Buying at a discount to then receive the face value of the product at the end of the term.\n\nHowever, I do have a little confusion... If I buy a three month Treasury Bill (13 weeks) with $50k, and let's say the difference between the face value and the purchase value is $3k. And I also buy a 52-week TBill for the same amount, would I only be reaping $3k over the course of the year?\n\nI guess my main question is... How do these pay out and is there any advantage in longer term TBills?\n\nThank you!",

You can buy longer term 2-5-10-20 years bonds and locking in the rates\n\nHowever in your example a 3 month bill will not have the same return as a 12 month bill, the 12 month bill will have a higher return due to the longer maturity but the 3 month bill may have a higher rate but its only good for 3 months",

            "comment": "From reading, bills pay interest when they mature.  If you're buying them on the secondary market then there could be a discount as well due to current rates vs the interest rate the bill pays at.\n\nI've only bought notes on the secondary market.  Those pay interest every 6 months and you can also have a discount or premium in price depending on what the rate of the note is vs the current interest rate for that maturity.  You can also have to prepay interest that the note has accrued since the last interest payment.  So there can be several moving pieces there.\n\nIn general you go longer term if you want to lock in the available interest rate for a longer time.  Currently shorter term treasuries pay a higher rate of interest than longer term.  6 months seems to be the highest at around 5.43% while 30 years is 3.95%.  But if you buy a 6 month treasury and then rates drop, you might not be able to get a higher rate when you have to redeploy your capital.",

I came across the concept of the \"inverted yield curve\" in the book 'Investing Quickstart Guide' by Ted D. Snow.  \nThe current numbers confuse me, but do not look good based on my current understanding of this new-to-me concept...\nI found some info and did this [screenshot of Treasury yields taken from CNBC site](https://imgur.com/gallery/l61UBm3)\n\nMaybe others here could explain it better.   But, based on this it looks like 6-month treasuries are the best yield right now.  I could be way off base here, sorry.  I'm still learning and if anyone has more knowledge to share please do, with my extreme gratitude!",

If you think rates will go down you can buy longer term securities to lock in current rates. Obviously nobody actually knows what will happen so it's typically best to just match the duration to when you expect to need the principal.",

    "postText": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/03/biden-bans-us-investment-chinese-military-tech-surveillance\n\nJoe Biden has signed an executive order that bans American entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance technology sectors.\n\nIn a move that his administration says will expand the scope of a legally flawed Trump-era order, the US treasury will enforce and update on a \u201crolling basis\u201d the new ban list of about 59 companies.\n\nIt also bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, and replaces an earlier list from the defense department, senior administration officials told reporters.\n\n\nChips with everything: how one Taiwanese company drives the world economy\nRead more\nThe order prevents US investment from supporting the Chinese military-industrial complex, as well as military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, Biden said in the order.\n\n\u201cIn addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside [China] and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,\u201d Biden said.\n\nA White House fact sheet on the order said the policy would take effect for those companies listed on 2 August.\n\nMajor Chinese firms included on the previous defense department list were also placed on the updated list, including Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), China Mobile Communications Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).\n\nSMIC is key to China\u2019s national drive to boost its domestic chip sector.\n\n\u201cWe fully expect that in the months ahead \u2026 we\u2019ll be adding additional companies to the new executive order\u2019s restrictions,\u201d one of the senior officials said.\n\nA second official told reporters that the inclusion of Chinese surveillance technology companies expanded the scope of the Trump administration\u2019s initial order last year, which the White House argues was carelessly drafted, leaving it open to court challenges.\n\nThe president has been reviewing a number of aspects of US policy toward China, and his administration had extended a deadline for implementation set by Donald Trump\u2019s order while it crafted its new policy framework.\n\n\nApple uses more suppliers from China than Taiwan for first time, data shows\nRead more\nThe move is part of Biden\u2019s broader series of steps to counter China, including reinforcing US alliances and pursuing large domestic investments to bolster American economic competitiveness, amid increasingly sour relations between the world\u2019s two most powerful countries.\n\nBiden\u2019s Indo-Pacific policy coordinator, Kurt Campbell, said last month that a period of engagement with China had come to an end and that the dominant paradigm in bilateral ties going forward would be one of competition.\n\nSenior officials said the treasury would give guidance later on what the scope of surveillance technology means, including whether companies are facilitating \u201crepression or serious human rights abuses\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe really want to make sure that any future prohibitions are on legally solid ground. So, our first listings really reflect that,\u201d a second senior administration official said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestors would have time to \u201cunwind\u201d investments, a third official said.\n\nThe new list provided few surprises for investors looking to see if they need to unload even more Chinese stocks and bonds.\n\nBut some previously identified companies, such as Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), which is spearheading Chinese efforts to compete with Boeing and Airbus, as well as two companies that had challenged the ban in court, Gowin Semiconductor Corp and Luokung Technology Corp, were not included.\n\nIn May, a judge signed an order removing the designation on Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, which was among the more high-profile Chinese technology companies that the Trump administration targeted for alleged ties to China\u2019s military.",

The future of US-China relations are uncertain, but are not looking good. Eventually they will likely improve, but who's to say when that will be and what will be caught in the cross-fire?\n\nI can't respond because the thread is locked, but to those saying it will not improve - that's very short-sighted. And that assessment is precisely why I am saying investors needs to take geopolitics seriously in the globalized era. People that know how to study the relationships between states are who should be coming up with those assessments. And to find reason to suggest it will eventually go back to normal (and by eventually I of course do not necessarily mean in the next 5 years), we need only look at trade up to 2016. Issues eventually get resolved, and the obvious benefit of free trade provides very strong inventive to work this shit out. Geopolitics are very complex, which means you can't just take things at surface value. And, really, we still do a lot of business with China so to suggest that no one should invest in China, while I obviously agree that it should be avoided, is in itself somewhat dubious.",

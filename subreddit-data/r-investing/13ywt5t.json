    "postText": "My current portfolio consists of itot, schd, vxus, googl, and amzn. I bought googl and amzn for growth and sold calls while it was down. Looks like my shares will get called away this weekend. \n\nSo, I'm debating on DCAing $10k into schg or xlk and calling it a day. I used the etf overlap tool and itot more or less has everything in it. Is adding schg/xlk in place of googl &amp; amzn a reasonable idea, or should I just DCA the rest back into itot?",

            "comment": "XLK is the 65 companies defined as technology in the S&amp;P500, but does not have GOOGL or AMZN in it.  They are defined a communications and consumer stocks.  SCHG is about 250 of the largest 750 companies in any industry, with characteristics described as growth.\n\nXLK is a way to go heavier on big tech and SCHG a way to be heavier on big everything to compliment ITOT.  Either one (or both) are reasonable choices.",

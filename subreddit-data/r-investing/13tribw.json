                    "comment": "So I\u2019ve asked AI and here is the answer (without verifying accuracy):\n=======\n\nThere are many companies that are involved in AI development or application, and some of them may offer good investment opportunities. According to some sources, some of the best AI stocks to buy for 2023 are:\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT): A software giant that invested in OpenAI and is looking to reinvent its Bing search engine by integrating ChatGPT and its own Prometheus AI model.\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL): The parent company of Google and YouTube that uses AI and automation in virtually every facet of its business, from ad pricing to content promotion to Gmail spam filters. Google launched its Bard AI chatbot in March, and analysts say AI could help expand the internet search use case.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (META): The social media giant formerly known as Facebook that uses AI to enhance its products and services, such as content moderation, personalization, recommendation, and advertising. Meta also has a vision to create a metaverse, a virtual reality platform that will rely heavily on AIAd1.\nAdobe (ADBE): A software company that makes products for content creation, marketing, data analytics, document management, and publishing. Adobe announced new AI and machine learning capabilities in its Experience Cloud product, a marketing and analytics suite2.\nBaidu Inc. (BIDU): A Chinese internet search giant that also develops AI solutions for various industries, such as autonomous driving, cloud computing, smart devices, and healthcare.\n\nASML Holding NV (ASML): A Dutch company that makes lithography machines that are essential for producing advanced chips for AI applications. ASML has a dominant position in the market and benefits from the high demand for semiconductors.\n\nMicron Technology (MU): A chipmaker that makes high-performance memory and storage hardware that powers AI solutions. Micron\u2019s products are used in data centers and self-driving cars. Micron strengthened its AI portfolio when it purchased startup FWDNXT in 2019.\n\nIBM (IBM): A technology giant that launched its \u201cneuromorphic chip\u201d TrueNorth AI in 2014. IBM also develops AI solutions such as Watson and Project Debater.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM): A leading chip foundry that manufactures chips for many AI companies, such as Nvidia, AMD, and Apple.\n\nSalesforce (CRM): A cloud-based software company that provides customer relationship management solutions and a suite of enterprise applications focused on customer service, marketing automation, analytics, and application development. Salesforce uses AI to enhance its products and services, such as Einstein, an AI platform that delivers predictions and recommendations based on customer data.\n\nSplunk (SPLK): A software company that provides a data-to-everything platform that enables organizations to collect, analyze, and act on data from various sources. Splunk uses AI and machine learning to provide insights and solutions for IT operations, security, DevOps, business analytics, and more.",

                            "comment": "Let's rate their recommendations:\n\n* Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) - A+, effectively the owner of OpenAI, very good choice\n* Meta Platforms Inc. (META) - B-, Meta actually is low-key doing a ton of great AI work from a technical perspective, but it's not their business, and they are unlikely to profit off of the rise of AI\n* ASML Holding NV (ASML) - C, they're definitely a relevant company though I'm not sure that AI will propel their growth by any significant fashion\n* Micron Technology (MU) - C-, it's a tech company but not really relevant\n* IBM (IBM) - C-, same as above\n* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM) - B, they're extremely relevant for NVDA et. al. but again, AI will not supercharge their growth\n* Salesforce (CRM) - D, Salesforce might make use of AI effectively in the future to make huge gains in sales productivity, but it seems unlikely\n* Splunk (SPLK) - D-, this is not the way to invest in AI at all.\n\nThe last two I would categorize as AI hallucination to be honest rather than a real recommendation",

Social media sites are already flooded with fake content. There is already tons of fake and low effort posts on youtube, reddit, instagram, twitter, etc. youtube is full of ai generated videos with robot voice overs and stock footage. instagram is full of hyper-edited, materialistic, and fake posts already. If anything, generative ai will elevate the bar. People can make high quality content faster. People will be generating photo realistic videos, special effects, images, etc with no require technical skills. This will result in content being more engaging\n\n2. If generative ai gets so good to the point where it's difficult to tell the difference between real and fake, I don't think people will care. Social media is already like this. I don't think the youth and people using apps like instagram care whether that video of you fighting a crocodile is real or not, or that instagram short of you doing that new dance move, it'll be hilarious nonetheless.\n\nPeople will be so addicted to these platforms that meta will print even more money",

For one Taiwan is pretty financially dependent on China. So when the time comes China will put Taiwan on its knees and force it to be assimilated. The only thing that would force China to take Taiwan by force is if they completely get starved out of semiconductors as the US is attempting. At that point China may be desperate to save itself at all cost. **This is not an unlikely possibility, but it wouldn't be China's preferred approach.** But China ultimately doesn't necessarily want to end the world.\n\nPutin is your aging dictator looking for glory and fame and trying to immortalize his image in the history books as his life fades. Consequences be damned, all the young Iives lost, heck world war in nuclear Armageddon,  are a sacrifice he is willing to make for his ego.",

    "postText": "Hi all,\nJust wanted to put some info out there and see if you guys have any tips to better handle my 401k.\n\nAs the title states, using fidelity's index fund with a retirement year goal of 2050. I have been working for 10 years and have just over 200k in my 401k. My company matches half up to 8%, and I have always contributed 8% or more (usually 10%). I have no pension so this is all I have to retire on. \n\nAny tips to capitalize on what I already have? I have a basic knowledge of the stock market and have about 8k worth of personal stocks I manage myself. I am an amateur trader at best so I am not really comfortable with managing my 401k completely by myself.\nJust wondering if there is anything I am missing out on? \n\nThanks all",

S&amp;P is the top 500 companies in the US on the NYSE. \n\nAs for Target Date Funds, they also have mutual funds with various sectors as well as bonds. What TDFs do is weigh risk. For example, if you're retiring in 2050 like the OP, there will be less risky investments, bonds, in the fund. If you were retiring in 2030, there would be a lot less risk in the fund (less mutual funds) and more bonds for more stability. \n\nSo the only consequence is when you retire vs recovery from a market downturn. For example, there are many people who would have retired in the last 3 years but they didn't adjust their retirement portfolios to safe investments. So when the market dropped 20%+, their portfolio went down with it. If you're younger (20s/30s, maybe 40s), you will have time to recover the losses. If you're in your late 50s or 60s, you might not have time to recover before you start drawing from your retirement accounts.",

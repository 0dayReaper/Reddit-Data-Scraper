    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nSo we're going to move to a new home in the next year and will have to decide whether to keep our current home or sell it upon moving.\n\nWe have a relatively large equity in this home - Home value is about $700k per RedFin and $200k mortgage left. I did a high-level calc. Rental estimate is $3,951. Taking out mortgage, property tax, insurance and HOA, we would get roughly $1,500 net cashflow per month, without counting tax or any repair cost. So that's **about 3.6% ROE on $500K equity (rental income only)**? I haven't been a landlord before so not sure if I missed anything. But I assume the actual ROE will be even lower with all the repair and maintenance etc. On the flip, we're in a good home market. Many people moving in from other states and home price/rents are raising in the last few years. It does not look like this trend will end very soon.\n\nThis makes me wonder if it's a good idea to sell the home and invest like I normally would or hold it. For a simple example, S&amp;P500 has always out-performed real estate index no matter what periods I tried to back-test it. Even if I do miss the \"income\" piece at some point, there're things like SCHD with 3-4% dividend yield and higher total return even without DRIP. Plus it's hassle-free to hold an ETF than a rental home.\n\nWhat would you do in this case and any thought/comment is highly appreciated!\n\n(Also a side note - There's some of psychological effect comes into plays here. We come from a certain demographic group where people, especially older generation, value RE as the pinnacle of investing (yes Asian). Not saying people would brag about how many homes they own. But most have a strong preference of tangible assets over financial assets and RE is consider the \"textbook\" approach to grow/preserve wealth in a long run. Obviously, I'm not fully convinced by this idea but it still haunts me quite a bit over the years.)",

Would you buy a similar house (assume you can get the old APR) for the sole purpose of renting it out, or would you do something else like invest in the market?  Whatever your answer is, do that.",

Many are still renting but they have not paid since 2020. Some counties still  have moratorium blame rain from last winter and they still can stay until fall this year. There are also some measurements to restrict single family home rent raise like apartments. I personally know a property owner who is obligated to pay utilities per lease and repair and they are over $120K behind in rent.  If the evication moratorium is defrost there is about 6 additional months waiting at court to decide evict or get to stay.   Frustrated landlords in SF and other areas just sell the properties w/ hostile tenants to bargain hunters to let them deal tenants who know the law better than you. They also have a lawyer claiming you mistreat and harass them. You now owe them money. The same applies to many states as well.\n\nGood luck.",

You can hire a property manager to do most of the day to day work, but it\u2019s going to eat up most of your cash flow. Me personally, I\u2019d sell the house and invest any excess proceeds in a total stock market index fund, and leave it there until retirement. You\u2019ll probably get a better total return long term, and it requires zero work or exposure to being sued.",

There is good money to be made since Chinese still cks are traded cheaply (due to the risk) but for every sucess story you'll have dozens of not more total losses.\n\n\n\nChinese stocks, Indian stocks, might as well go all in on short termed options. The risk of losing everything is great either way... Or gamble, and be prepared to sell at a seconds notice",

            "comment": "in theory - china asking big banks to cut deposit rates again is indeed a move to boost the economy. when deposit rates are lowered, it encourages people to spend and invest their money instead of keeping it in the bank. this can potentially stimulate economic activity and drive up the stock market.\n\nhowever, whether it's a good sign for chinese stocks depends on various factors. while the rate cut may provide a short-term boost, it's always (more so with china) worth considering the overall economic conditions, market sentiment, and government policies. china's stock market has always been heavily influenced by a range of factors, including global trade tensions, regulatory changes etc.\n\ni usually keep one ear to china stocks - personally use both the [investing journal](https://www.investingjournal.gg/) newsletter (free), or the [financial times](https://www.ft.com/global-economy) ' global economy section, both offer pretty in-depth coverage of global financial markets, including china.",

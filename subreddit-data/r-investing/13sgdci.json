However Im not versed in them and would love to hear about the current performance of the CLO market, and how the debt default talks have been affecting it from someone with more knowledge than I possess. \n\nThank you!",

Not very good investments historically. Might be different investing in CLOs directly but I wouldn't be comfortable doing that.",

    "postText": "Switched over yesterday and am having a hard time dealing with the differences in the apps. \n\nOn the TDA app, I could customize my positions screen so I could see current pricing (even in after-hours/pre-market).  My watchlists also showed me current prices during AH/PM.  \n\nOn the Schwab app, I have to toggle between tabs to see current prices and my current G/L.  Finding and displaying AH/PM pricing in a watchlist or positions list is impossible.  \n\nIt used to be so easy to see all the information I needed to decide when to buy and sell, and now I am feeling stuck with this POS app.\n\nDoes anyone know how I can get the schwab app to work the way I need it to, or can anyone recommend a brokerage that has an app that will show real-time pricing 24 hours a day, preferably in customizable list form the way TDA did?  I am so frustrated rn.",

If I wanted something like ToS and couldn't get it until they decide to port that functionality over, I'd be looking for a new account to operate with that has a better platform. That seems like a big mistake on their part to miss out on that... crazy",

On the Schwab app (which one? Android or iOS?), I have to toggle between tabs to see current prices and my current G/L. Finding and displaying AH/PM pricing in a watchlist or positions list seems impossible.\n\nIf there's a better way to do it, let me know, but otherwise I really like the way TDA does it with their app.  Might be worth passing along to your mobile team.\n\n\\----\n\nThat single piece of feedback is unlikely to move things much (even if it does get noticed and they agree - it's probably several months of real time before any changes are made).  But just adding another vote for \"Improve this section of the mobile app\" matters.  I would use Chat/Email support if possible.  Written records of customer feedback are more meaningful than hearsay from a voice conversation.\n\nEdit - One last thing, check if the app already has a \"provide feedback\" option buried somewhere.  Usually that will go right to the PM on the correct development team.  I know it feels like dropping a message down a well never to be seen again - but decent PMs really want that feedback.",

I don't see anything equivalent in Schwab app.  Even if the data is there somewhere there is NO SORTING anywhere.  Dumbest table implementation I have seen pretty much anywhere.  Any GUI framework I have used has sorting built in and the developer has to go out of their way to disable it.\n\nFinally the dividend and income estimator has no detail.  I can't see anything.  I used to look in TD to see what holding was contributing the most by dollar, by percentage, using sorting of course.  Also sorted by next pay date to see what was coming.\nNone of this is possible with Schwab's app.\n\nThings I did are simply not possible in the Schwab app.   Oh and why did they break out ETFs from stocks?

The app has been recently dumbed down beyond any utility whatsoever. E.G. you can no longer check the high/low/historical option prices until AFTER you have placed a trade; good time to do some forensic research. Used to be that if you wanted to update the current price for a stock or option (no streaming prices) you would swipe down- now, that action returns you to a previous screen that bears no relationship to the current research or trade screen. Someone there at Schwab thought that was a clever idea- amazing. Like others have mentioned, I can't always open a laptop and login to Streetsmart Edge (in the cloud only: Schwab has utter disdain for Apple) so the app is crucial. \n\n I just retired and am currently looking for a new platform: I'm considering IBKR and Fidelity.",

I'm thinking of either switching to Robinhood for their app UI experience or IBKR Pro for their cheap margin interest. Both of them have way better margin interest rates compared to other brokers, I don't use margin often but if there is a really good sale on a stock and I don't have cash I like to use margin occasionally. \n\nI'm a buy and hold dividend investor so I don't do anything complex and I do everything on my phone. All the stocks I have bought have been through the TDA app on my phone, I hardly ever login through my computer. Robinhood gets grief for the Gamestop debacle but that affected many brokers. Robinhood is very simple which is nice but I wonder if it's too simple and how they handle investing in MLPs like EPD which generate K1 tax forms.\n\nThe other big downside for Robinhood I've read is they don't support selling specific tax lots for stocks. So if you want to minimize your taxes and sell certain lots you're out of luck. I just want Robinhood's app copied to other brokers lol. \n\nI've been thinking more about switching to IBKR lite or pro but I don't know much about their app experience.",

I'm more active there (not a day trader, maybe check often but trade a couple times a month) so the missing features in the Schwab app and the website hurt.  Fidelity is just not great compared to TDA either so I'll have to use both more and do more research on an alternative that is closer to TDA.\n\nOn the plus side I can say that I talked with Schwab support about things that seemed to be missing from the website and they were easy to get a hold of and helpful.",

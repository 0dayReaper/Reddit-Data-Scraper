Is there any point in buying into a treasury fund at the moment when the money market seems to currently outperform it?\n\nEdit: I should note that this would be in a Roth IRA, so taxes should not apply.",

But the reverse is true if rates don't go down then you lose money in the short term, longer term has more risk but generally will have higher average return. (personally I don't think long term rates are going to come down tho)",

Short term bond funds make most of their return from yield not from price appreciation. In the case of USFR, the share price is going up every trading day in anticipation of the monthly distribution as the market is pro rating the expected yield. Once it pays out, the price resets to roughly where it was at the start of the monthly cycle. So you are making money primarily by collecting the yield it pays out each month. Look at [the fund page](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/etfs/fixed-income/usfr) to see what the current monthly yields are. Today the average yield to maturity is 5.47%, minus 0.15% expense ratio, meaning you can expect it to earn about 5.32% this week, and the rate will change every week with the prevailing 3-month T-bills rate.",

So a dumb purchase.\n\nIs that right? Or can I actually use those yield to worst calculations?",

But also if rates do down as expected then longer term treasuries will appreciate and the total return even in the near term may be more that the current advertised yield. But rates could go up/down more than expected so there is volatility risk to longer duration, you can lose principal before they mature. Money markets should not lose any value.",

The simple answer is that we have an inverted curve, so shorter maturities (the ones MMFs are forced into) have a higher yield that longer dated ones. The 3month bill yields 5.30, the 2yr 4.56 and the 10yr 3.81 so shorter maturity is the higher paying yield at the moment. \n\nHowever, your view on what may come to pass in the next few years will have a larger impact on your decision. Historically, inverted curves are a predictor of rates being cut soon (I personally do not believe this to be the case this time, but I\u2019m just a guy on the internet) so a bond fund who has invested in longer maturities will perform better than a MMF who would see their higher yielding paper roll off and then have to reinvest in lower yielding paper. \n\nThe decision comes down to your views. We are at a weird time, for \u201cusually\u201d bond funds would yield higher than MMFs.",

I\u2019ll preface stating that I retired a few years ago but traded in the money market space for a couple decades. Just looked at SGOV\u2019s price action and I don\u2019t understand stand why it looks like a saw blade (spikes up and down). I\u2019m sure if I dig into it further it\u2019s likely a mark-market valuation that is influenced by the tightenings but compared to a MMF, which has a steady incline versus the more volatile ETF pricing. (I\u2019ll bet they end in the same place, but would suck if you had to sell for some reason on one of those down days. \n\nSecond, I\u2019d choose a MMF that is eligible for the Fed\u2019s RRP facility. Just a couple months ago, that yielded as high or higher than 1&amp;2 mo bills. Since the Fed has continued to keep the RRP award rate above the Fed Funds rate (it\u2019s usually 5bps below) it seems like a great safety valve which an ETF won\u2019t have. If the short curve (1-3months) goes inverted again, the MMF can divert funds into the RRP and lock in a return above the FFR. \n\nFinally, there is a ton more of regulation and oversight on a MMF versus an ETF. MMFs are covered by the SIPC, I don\u2019t believe ETFs are. \n\nAs for whether the short term outlook looks better for a short maturity investment (a MMF or the aforementioned ETF) versus something further out the curve, that\u2019s really up to you. The curve is inverted, which means there is a ton of money betting on/expecting the Fed to cut rates.  This has change a bit in the last two weeks. 2yrs yielded 4% to weeks ago and have backed up to 4.57. So the market is moving towards the Fed not easing soon but 4.57% is well below FFR which is 5%. Point being, if the Fed does ease or signals they may ease soon, then a longer maturity fund is the better place to be. If you don\u2019t think that is the case, the shorter maturity gives you less risk, higher yield (for now), and an easier and more liquid option if you choose to suddenly change your mind.",

It's potentially misleading.  Most seem to agree we are currently in a bear market.  And, back around -- of course this is probably a great time to invest for the long term because of that.

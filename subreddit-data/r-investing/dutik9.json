    "postText": "The course gives a broad overview of introductory finance that most here will obviously already know. \n\nThe first reason I thought it worth sharing is because the teacher (Andrew Lo) is probably the best and most passionate finance professor I've ever seen. Really hooks you into the lectures. \n\nThe second is that the course is filmed during the height of the subprime crisis, and each lecture starts with a discussion of recent events and how they relate to concepts in the course. Very interesting to hear perspectives and how they progress throughout the crisis.\n\n\n[Lecture Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdHlfiOAJyE&amp;list=PLUl4u3cNGP63B2lDhyKOsImI7FjCf6eDW)\n\nFor those of you that want a great discussion/explanation about what caused the mispricing of subprime mortgages (as opposed to the superficial one given in The Big Short), I would recommend the following section from\n\n[Lecture 7: Fixed-Income Securities IV](https://youtu.be/ZWKnK9LIETA?t=1983)",

As long as cash flow is expected in the future (and why else would there be any value), you can use DCF (though it will be more inaccurate and more for a sanity check then actual valuation, but I already said that).",

You're splitting hairs, I already said it's not perfect but it can be used to determine if a price is at least sane. History of profitability makes it easier but is no means a requisite to DCF. Future earnings is what matters. And that's actual earnings. You're a fool if you use EBITA because interest, taxes, and amortization/depreciation affect actual cash flow.",

Then I get a little bored and he gets a new point across and I\u2019ve already missed it. But I agree with one poster here about how cool Lo is during the emergent recession, he really spoke like everything is alright and not truly a crisis.  I especially enjoyed but am also a little worried about how much he downplayed stocks as it\u2019s just volatile and the bond market severely dwarfs the stock market and dives deeply into coupon rates. While I\u2019m sure most people like me in their 30s have a majority equity portfolio and aren\u2019t looking at bonds. Interesting times ahead?",

Core inflation seems kind of \"stuck\" around 5%, mostly because the cost of shelter is up around 8% year-over-year.  \n \n\"They\" say that shelter data lags reality by quite a bit, so it may be that we're functionally still seeing 2022 numbers.  If that's the case, we'd hope to see shelter inflation drop moving forward, pulling numbers down for the next year.  OTOH, some say the issues with housing are systemic and there's no relief in sight.",

                            "comment": "Shelter lags because rental housing is on a 1- or 2- year lease. The amount you paid for a lease starting in May is basically the same as for one starting in April. But they went up a LOT over the last 2 years, so if you're renewing a 2-year lease, you're paying a lot more, so the average amount paid by everyone goes up by a chunk.\n\nZillow has the \"Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI)\", at [https://www.zillow.com/research/data/](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). Looking at the seasonally adjusted data for the US:  \n5/2023 is 2048, 4/2023 is 2045. That's a 0.5% annualized rate, basically flat.  \n5/2022 is 1951, we're up 5% since then. 5/2021 is 1683, we're up at an 11% annualized rate since then. \n\nSo even though the rental prices aren't going up recently, the average amount people are paying for rent still is. That's why \"they\" say shelter data lags.",

I bought in 2014, and yes, my house is worth double what it was before, but even if I was wanting to downsize, it wouldn't be financially practical right now because I'd be going from a 2% rate to something like a 8% rate.

However the US is a huge country with a lot of space to build homes. As places like downtowns slowly die(as they are also horrible soul crushing concrete pits) people will be able to move out of confined spaces into more open areas. Hell if just 5-10% of the population left large cities prices and rents would drop considerably. The problem ATM is 20 year leases on huge office space that is forcing people back to offices and back to downtowns. Congress could fairly easily come in and cover those losses for any company that allows full time remote work and kept people more spread out... Really it would be benificial across the board, from less pollution, to less demands on small living spaces...",

Zoning regulations didn't suddenly restrict over the past 3 years -- they've been more or less flat relative to a more or less flat population. Relaxing zoning regulations isn't going to help when (just as now) idiots are given free reign to bid up prices with borrowed money or just poor personal finance skills. If you want to lower prices then you need to lower credit availability and increase lending standards, in addition to driving up inventory with forced sales secondary to rising unemployment. There is no other solution.",

Prior to the rate hikes, we had a good decade of near-free money, with a lot of cash sloshing around looking for a return (hence why there were ridiculously overvalued gimmick stocks and cryptocoins).  Pandemic hit, some of that cash sought out a safe, stable investment like housing, whether as long term rentals or AirBnBs.  Everyone's aunt seems to be a landlord now.  Regular Mary and Joe just trying to buy their first house with a 30 year fixed rate and 5% down, they are now competing against bigger money that can offer cash.  Plus the pandemic softened up employers to permit remote work, so some folks picked up and moved to cheaper areas, basically gentrifying them and pricing locals out.\n\nAnother factor is the labor shortage.  We simply don't have enough people to build the shit, and didn't have them before the pandemic either.  Labor costs go up, supply chain issues driving costs up, then new residential prices get passed onto the buyers for projects already in design.  For projects not yet even in design, the labor and material shortages can kill them...also causing a lag in the supply of new residential and boosting demand for existing residential.",

My wife's parents are in this boat.\n\nI wouldn't mind a good 20% drop in the value of my home. It would greatly reduce my property taxes. Most of my net worth isn't in my house and even a drop of 40% wouldn't put me underwater. I don't view the equity in my home as an investment. I own a home because I want to live in it, not because I want to generate a return on it. Its a thing I need, like a car or a bed. But I am not most people. Most people, epically older folks, need home prices to stay high and go higher. But as a home owner I benefit from that so, meh.",

The US is expecting a very weak wheat harvest and Ukraine obviously is having issues producing. \n\nIf the US has an unexpectedly large harvest, I'd expect the prices to fall but otherwise we probably won't see much of a drop until next year. \n\nNonalcoholic beverages is pretty clear. Coke and Pepsi both raised their prices; the regular price of a 12-pack went from about $5 to $8 while the sale prices went from $3-4 to $6-7. Those prices probably won't fall until consumers reduce their spending. \n\nRent is rather complicated and likely won't drop unless we start building more quickly. The jump in motor insurance likely is mostly due to the rising costs of new vehicles, lack of parts, and, in small part, due to the Hyundai-Kia thefts raising their rates for coverage. The jump for repairs is also mostly due to the lack of parts.",

CPI ex-food and energy topped out a little over 6% and really hasn't dropped all that much. This inflation will continue to be persistent unless the Fed breaks its back with high interest rates like they did in the 70s and 80s. No soft landing will come of this. All they're doing is prolonging the inevitable. Not raising rates would have worked in the back half of 2022 when the dollar was stronger (strong dollar = deflationary pressure) but not now. Break the back of inflation. No balls.",

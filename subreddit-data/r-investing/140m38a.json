    "postText": "My research so far has told me that Edward Jones has a bad reputation, particularly for very high fees compared to the industry average. Searching Edward Jones in this subreddit specifically was actually very telling. \n\nThe reason Edward Jones initially seemed so attractive to me is because I don't have a background in finance, and they are very friendly towards people who are transitioning their careers. I also have a connection who is a Financial Advisor with Edward Jones who I respect a lot (they can't all be that bad). Anyways, that connection made the jump seem way more doable for someone like me who has always had a personal interest in personal finance and investing, but doesn't have the professional experience to back it up.   \n\n\nI recently moved to Columbia, SC where there seem to be quite a few opportunities with Edward Jones,  but I am obviously a little uneasy about it given how much they charge their clients. One of my best friends is also a CFP with Fidelity, but unfortunately Fidelity isn't in Columbia. They're in Charleston, Greenville, and Charlotte nearby. It seems like there are potentially some opportunities with Merrill Lynch and Charles Schwab, but that definitely seems like it would be difficult for me to get into. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on Financial Advisors as a whole, and/or which institution provides the best services?",

If you make it, great. If not, that's just fine, too.\n\nMost start then take their book elsewhere because commissions and trails are better elsewhere. The business is EDJ's but the relationships are yours.\n\nAbout relationships: You'll harvest your warm market then do the best you can elsewhere. Your beginnings is commensurate your warm market and connections. Once that's exhausted, you'll have nothing more than hard work and luck. Hence the 95+% attrition.\n\nThere are some silver-tongued devils that can sell helicopters to hummingbirds. If you're one of those, you're going to be fine wherever you end up.\n\nI had a colleague who didn't make it, ended up selling insurance, property and casualty. Killed it, said it was 10x easier than EDJ. I'm still in the business, service stuff for banking and brokerage. Tried two other sales jobs, ETRADE and VALIC. Flopped at both.\n\nRemember, 95+% attrition. It's not impossible but it's pretty close for a majority of us.",

That's part of the reason I'm investigating EJ so much. \n\nBut, I feel like making it this far in D2D sales is hopefully a good sign that I can stick with a role like this. I can do relationship building really well. I feel like it's a good fit, I just don't want to be in a situation where I am selling a product that I'm not fully convinced of myself.",

You will of course know that Dish only costs less for the first year of the two year contract, then goes up - not to mention the shit-ier quality, fewer channels and non-existent customer service.\n\nIt's a bit odd you have a conscience about financial advice, but happily push a garbage product by (literally) going door to door, and then convince yourself you saved someone money.",

Which is fine, except it's strange that you would be such a keyboard warrior over something you know nothing about. \n\n1.) Dish does a 3 year price lock on their new customer prices. I don't know where you got 1 year from. So, the price is locked for longer than the contract.\n\n2.) I save some customers over $100/month on their current bill. That amounts to over $3,600 over a 3 year period, not counting the fact that their bill with the current provider will go up during that time. \n\n3.) Every single customer I help either gets more channels for a lower price, or chooses to have a lower package to save money. Without exception. \n\n4.) The quality is almost objectively better. Dish can record 3x as many things at once. Dish has a voice activated remote. Dish gets YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon Prime built into every box. Dish can automatically remove commercials out of recordings. Dish has 2x the recording space. Dish has the largest selection of free on-demand movies and tv shows out of any provider.\n\n5.) Every customer I help gets a minimum $300 gift card for switching, some get up to $500.\n\n6.) I encourage them to switch providers again after their 3 year price lock is up if that would benefit them.\n\nAgain, I can't tell you how wrong you are. But I appreciate the attempt to tell me I rip people off for a living.",

I wasn't able to finish migrating her stuff to schwab before she passed away and i regret it. he used to call harassing her that she couldn't move her insurance policy without penalties.

For DIYers and investment hobbyists who use /r/investing the idea of using anybody but a \"fee only fiduciary\" or even paying an advisor anything at all is treated like highway robbery, but realistically there are many many people who could benefit from a *financial salesperson* convincing them to buy some equity mutual funds instead of leaving money sitting in a savings account or burning their money on meme stocks.\n\nAnd, for Average Dude with maybe $30k-$60k to invest and no willingness to pay thousands up front to a fee only advisor, EJ is the Main Street firm of personal finance that is willing to take their business. There are much worse places out there, both for advisors and clients.\n\nI'd say to /u/DavidZacharyYT that the skills gained at EJ can be valuable and you may be able to do good for people. You can always jump ship and go independent after a few years of building some experience at EJ.",

I\u2019m sorry your experience with your father wasn\u2019t a good one - that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the norm. Whole life insurance represents a very small portion of most FA\u2019s books, for me it\u2019s less than 1%. It\u2019s a niche-vehicle only suitable in certain situations. And believe it or not, sometimes it\u2019s simply something the client wants. Regardless of the situation, I always do my due diligence with the client to review suitability, cost, and alternatives.\n\nHow is the fee structure dishonest? It sounds like you don\u2019t know much about the fee structure. There are really only two options:\n\nOption 1: Brokerage, transaction-based accounts. This is, for most clients, the cheapest route if they plan to hold investments long term. If they want to purchase mutual funds, there is a sales load (up to 6%) associated with the purchase. It scales down the more they invest (breakpoints). Some clients prefer the active management approach, or desire a blend of active and passive strategies. If a client is investing a substantial amount, they can purchase at NAV, but are still responsible for the ongoing 12b1 fee. If they are purchasing ETFs, stocks, bonds, CD\u2019s, etc. there is a sales charge or commission cost associated with that purchase (or sell in some situations) - just like at almost every other brokerage. Generally, around 1.27%.\n\nOption 2: Fee-based accounts. This is generally a more expensive route, but if the client desires the ability to move in and out of different investments frequently, this can be a more cost-effective way to go. In addition, some clients who prefer to be more hands-off with their investments may prefer this style of investing and management. Similar to breakpoints in transactional accounts, the more clients have to invest, the lower the overall cost as a % of the AUM (starts around 1.35%, but can be a little higher in advisory/UMAs). There is no sales load in these accounts, but ER is something we still pay close attention to. Again, it comes down to what the client wants and how they feel we can provide value. If they feel we can\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t hurt my feelings for them to go DIY at Vanguard or Fidelity. Everyone is different and not everyone believes or thinks the way you do. Most of the clients I work with prefer a blend of both mutual funds and ETFs in their retirement accounts. My general recommendation is to utilize passive investment strategies within efficient markets, and active investment strategies in inefficient markets.\n\nClients cannot be charged a sales load, the ongoing ER, AND a fee for AUM\u2026that just doesn\u2019t exist. Hope that helps.",

    "postText": "So I know they say portfolio overlap is bad, but if you maintain the 70/30 split between US and International is it still harmful?\n\nExample:    You don\u2019t like the fact of putting all you US market money into one total stock market ETF owners by one of the major players\u2026..So for the 70% US equity, you split it between 35% VTI and 35% ITOT.        Yes they 99% overlap, but in total it represents 70%.    The fees are almost dead even.   You just don\u2019t want the money with one company. \n\nYou still have the other 30% all international etf, and some gold.\n\nI know it\u2019s not diversification since they hold the same companies, it\u2019s more not putting all your money with one financial companies basket:",

There is nothing wrong with be overweight in mid/small cap as long as you know why you are doing it as per your investment plan.",

            "comment": "No issue splitting between VTI and ITOT as far as overlap.  One thing to think about is that while both are total market funds, the market is heavily weighted for large-cap stocks and for example the median market cap for VTI is $125 Billion.  You may wish to consider mixing in ETFS like Vanguard Midcap (VO) and Vanguard Small cap (VB).  Additionally you mention International and gold - but the traditional 3 ETF Portfolio would also consider a bond ETF like BND and BNDX.   With respect to alternatives like gold you might also consider other alternatives such as real-estate ETFs -  VNQ and VNQI.",

    "postText": "Well, that was unexpected. They did have a blow out quarter though:\n\nQ4 sales topped $100 billion for the first time:  $125.56 billion vs. $119.70 billion expected and $87.44 billion year-over-year\n\nEPS: $14.09 vs. $7.34 expected - which is insane as well.\n\nI'm gonna need a day to grasp this. What the hell Jeff.\n\nEdit:  Bezos will transition to Executive Chair, and Andy Jassy will take over as CEO. Jassy is currently AWS CEO.\n\n&gt; \u201cAmazon is what it is because of invention. We do crazy things together and then make them normal. We pioneered customer reviews, 1-Click, personalized recommendations, Prime\u2019s insanely-fast shipping, Just Walk Out shopping, the Climate Pledge, Kindle, Alexa, marketplace, infrastructure cloud computing, Career Choice, and much more,\u201d said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO. \u201cIf you do it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. That yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive. When you look at our financial results, what you\u2019re actually seeing are the long-run cumulative results of invention. Right now I see Amazon at its most inventive ever, making it an optimal time for this transition.\u201d \n\n[Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-reports-4q-2020-earnings-results-152012181.html)",

Better to free up a little bit of that control and maintain the soaring profits we have all shared.",

I just get a refund if something gets held at customs or shows up different from what's advertised or lacking safety certifications, etc. Can't be good for Amazon's bottom line to host that kind of business.",

You can curate the website to the brand in a similar way that the atmosphere of a retail store is integral to the brand itself.\n\nThere's been a bit of this, but I'm amazed that AMZN hasn't dug into it yet. You should have been able to search \"Nike\" and be able to purchase from a webpage (on amazon.com) that looks more like the Nike website... Because let's be honest, Amazon.com looks like it's still in 2010.",

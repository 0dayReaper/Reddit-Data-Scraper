This is going to ignore a lot of flows, margin requirements, etc, but its illustrative\n\nLets say simple dumb example with the following, assuming only 100 shares exist\n\nWSB-A owns 100 shares in their portfolio of many stocks, but its a margin account.  Which means their broker (Broker-A) can use the shares to help fund the margin account. \n\nHF-A wants to short the stock, so it calls Broker-A, Broker-A borrows the shares from WSB-A account and lends them to HF-A\n\nHF-A sells the stock in the market and is now short (borrow vs. a sell)\n\nWSB-B wants in on the action and buys the $100 in their account at Broker-B, which is also a margin account with only this one stock in it\n\nHF-A wants to short more of the stock, calls Broker-A, they have no more shares to lend, so they call Broker-B \n\nBroker B goes into WSB-B account and borrows those to lend to shares to HF-A who then sells in the market.  \n\nThey are now short 2x the outstanding shares, however there is now 2x the ownership than there should be.  \n\nNow again I am not saying this is what is happening or not, however the accusations of lying, fraud, naked shorts etc, are not entirely accurate as it is possible to get here with everything on the up and up.  That doesn't change that what is happening is fascinating to watch and I can not wait to read all the postmortem, and it is a turning point for retail investors, however I hope people are smart and take their gains before this all unwinds.",

Honestly, in this day and age, there should be a chain of custody on stocks to prevent this kind of double borrowing. In essence, this is still naked shorting because the the stock owned by WSB-B was actually borrowed from WSB-A and sold to him. So until WSB-A is made whole by being given back his shares, the shares owned by WSB-B should not be available for borrowing. My two cents.",

If we followed your approach then you wouldn't be able to use that stock for margin since it was already \"owned\" by someone originally. \n\nSo while the short interest in my example may be 2x; the long interest is 3x; which you can infer that it provides more access to the shares than would be if it weren't for short sellers.",

They can just continue pushing share prices down by selling shares that don't exist so that they have a mark to market profit on their books and they can take their 2 and 20 (or 2 and 30 in Melvin's case). Share price starts going up? Just keep shorting at it and push it back down so you're again at a profit.\n\nOf course this leads to a complete and utter lack of control over risk, so now Melvin has imploded and taken probably half their AUM with them. Then the copycat hedge funds that probably mimicked half their trades start melting down as well.\n\nI guess I shouldn't be surprised, but having CNBC and numerous regulators essentially come out to try and protect these absolutely reckless hedge funds is ludicrous. They should be attacking them for having done something so insanely irresponsible and demanding that they close their short positions but that's not what they're doing.",

By borrowing it, they actually have possession of the stock to sell.  \n\nThe economics are the same, kind of.  Harder to locate shares cost more to short (via interest and margin requirements); that helps the broker with risk management of the HF.  Without the borrow HF could just do something stupid like say try to sell 8 bazillion shares, this limits them to only be able to sell what is lendable",

They can then go on an legitimately lend it again. Now the same share has been lent and shorted twice.",

All this, a week prior to two major presentations.\n\nTicker falls to 22-23 and recovers. Squeeze is on as available shares go from 7k to 250k. Iceberg comes back with another splashy release and 5 more lawsuits. Stock goes back to 25 and hangs there. \n\nWolfpack did the same thing to MVIS. Shorts suppressed the price all summer long and when the squeeze was on they ran to Seeking Alpha bloggers to put out scary stories. \n\nPeople have had enough",

Plain and simple, and I think everyone understands this.\n\nI don't think anyone on their right mind thinks GME is worth $300 a share and possibly much more (depending how high it ends up going).\n\nIt's a play. Plain and simple. A bunch of people saw shorts being wildly overextended, and they knew they could come in and drive them into a narrowing wedge that would shoot the price up.\n\n--\n\nWhose fault is that? The people taking advantage of the situation for profit, or the people who put themselves in that position to begin with?\n\n--\n\nMaybe I'm dead wrong, but, for the most part, I see Hedge Funds as just people being part of the big boys club. No one, unless they had a personal vendetta with the funds involved in this GME short play would intentionally go and squeeze them because they still have to work in this market after the fact-- they're not going to pulverize bridges.\n\nSo the funds felt like they could do this. No one would catch them. No one's gonna do anything about it... and when GME eventually filed chapter 7 and went to 0, they'd be off the hook.\n\nEasy money off of shorting a moribund company.\n\n--\n\nWell, now \"retail investors\" (which I think is a slight... but I get it) caught wind of it, and piled on them.\n\n--\n\nThey don't to cry foul because they got checkmated in their game.\n\n--\n\nThey should have never been able to hold this position to begin with... and if regulation comes down on this, that's where I hope they'll look at. The problem isn't the people freely exchanging information, the problem is allowing such a precarious and vulnerable position to exist.\n\n--\n\nWhich is why it's bonkers to me that NASDAQ CEO came out and said \"If we get wind of social media talking about a stock here, we're gonna suspend trading on it.\"",

I called and explained that shouldn't matter because I own enough shares to cover the option. Phone lady stepped away, came back, and said yeah, you're right, want us to place the order for you? I said sure, but it won't be bought now because the share price and premiums have fallen. They said sorry this restriction has been placed on all td ameritrade accounts right now and we don't know when it will be lifted. I explained that there's no special risk in writing covered calls, the new arbitrary rule is costing people like me money for no apparent reason. She agreed and just said it's the current rule.  \n\nHow does preventing me from locking in gains and hedging a price drop protect me? You're exactly right, this stuff is a load of garbage. They're actively hindering their clients from making money!",

No way it will be all rich people.  It's like any war--some good people are gonna die, even if the war is just.\n\n(2) [Short selling is good](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/current_issues/ci18-5.html) (obviously not over 100% which is nuts) and we need people to do it; it helps ensure bad companies are snuffed out and money is invested in companies that will make use of it.  If shorts are extra risky because internet forums try to crush them, that could make the market a lot worse, and not in a way that benefits the little guy.  \n\nSo I don't see any case for arguing that $GME is particular is a problem, but if this sorta thing were to happen all the time (seems unlikely, I think this is historic, but that's just my opinion) then you could see real problems.\n\nSocial media and widespread internet connectivity are *extremely* new and no one has any idea how this is gonna play out.  IMHO we've seen it hugely influence politics in a way that is, at best, mixed.  Not hard to imagine markets could be negatively effected.  I'm optimistic that we'll figure it out in the long run, but in the meantime it's certainly worth monitoring and keeping tabs on.",

This whole scenario is the little guys catching the big guys with their pants down, in a corner, using the rules of the game against them to create a positive feedback loop that lets the bulls slaughter the bears.\n\nThe current market for $GME is still a price discovery mechanism for a stock that was nearly worthless, is possibly priceless in the immediate near-term, and will possibly be relatively worthless again once the bears give up shorting this stock and this thing fizzles.  So from that perspective, Wapner should agree that there is a fundamental reason for what the price action is doing, it's just not the business' fundamentals.\n\nChamath made points that would have precluded this from happening:\n\n1) outlawing shorting more than the float.\n\n2) requiring transparency for institutional firms.",

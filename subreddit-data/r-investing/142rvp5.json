    "postText": "**Edit: Made a call to Schwab and now have StreetSmart Edge. My prayers are answered, this'll be a fun rabbit hole. I will still say the \"mainline\" Schwab interface is not as good as TD Ameritrade's was.**\n\n\nTitle. Tons of little things I don't like about Schwab's interface and a couple big things I completely hate. Looks like I have a 250-character minimum, so here are some:\n\n* No streaming quotes! Not by default at least. Neither in the \"position details\" view nor in the ticker lookup at the bottom\n* \"Refresh\" button is in an inconvenient place. Which I have to click more often because no streaming quotes.\n* Don't like the layout of the detail stock quote page AT ALL. In particular, have to scroll down to see earnings/PE/dividend data, while the top of the page has useless junk such as sustainability scores\n* Harder to search for specific transactions\n* Positions view doesn't allow for day's high and low (important to me, TDA had it)\n* In general, less efficient , less compact layout overall \n\nThese are just a few of my complaints. NOTHING about Schwab's platform experience is better to me. Maybe they have customization tools I'm missing but they're not obvious. IBKR is about to gain another client.\n\nI'm not a super-frequent trader at all, usually &lt;10 trades per year, but when I do trade I want it to be efficient and want all the info I need right in front of me. More importantly I use my brokerage account as my bank, with all my cash going through it, and Schwab just doesn't seem as set up for that as TDA was.\n\nAm I alone here? What am I missing?",

A lot of it is geared towards option and futures traders - it's similar in concept to the functionality available in ToS but it sounds like you didn't use it at TDA. Note that data in Ibkr isn't free unlike at Schwab/TDA.  The stock features in TWS isn't really any different than in Schwab SSE - iirc.\n\nI have never explored portfolio margin at Ibkr but my understanding is that portfolio margin at TDA/Schwab is less restrictive. Many traders with portfolio margin use box spread financing so margin rates don't really matter much. I don't know if Reg-T margin at Ibkr would be differently than at any other broker since brokers don't have much leeway in how Reg-T accounts are serviced.\n\nDo you already invest/trade on margin? That shouldn't have changed when your account transitioned to Schwab. Especially not a Reg-T account.\n\nIf you plan to switch to Ibkr because you prefer Ibkr's margin and TWS - that's an entirely different reason. And tbh - it really should have no bearing on the TDA/Schwab transition.\n\nThe other reason why someone may switch from Schwab/TDA is the API - it's been a bit messy. But it doesn't sound like you are an algo trader. I could imagine people being upset with the Schwab/TDA API and switching to Ibkr or even the new TastyTrade API.\n\nAnyways - I can understand why people would get annoyed if they are used to doing things one way and now it's different. I would expect that for most passive and buy/hold investors - it probably just getting used to how things are organized in the web site.\n\nBut if you are looking for active trading services like custom order types and API access - then you should definitely explore other brokers. I was told that TDA active trading services and features such as portfolio margin rules. futures platform, and ToS are the go-forward solution at Schwab. So if you want to stay at Schwab for active trading and those features - you would have to open a TDA account.\n\nBTW - I don't understand your comment about streaming quotes not being available. I've always seen realtime streaming quotes at Schwab.",

I'm split on IBKR, it would have advantages but gives me more than I really need and as you said, wouldn't be free.\n\nI don't see streaming anything anywhere in my Schwab account. TDA even used to update my balances every 5-10 minutes, Schwab doesn't even do that for me. Oh and I'd like to have the main indices (SPX/INDU/NDX) on the same screen with my positions as TDA did, can't figure out how to do that on Schwab, not even by creating a watch list.",

So I prefer to use an actual trading desktop app. \n\nIf you are an active trader - and you need real-time level 2 quotes - just use the brokers desktop trading platform. \n\nBalances in both TDA and Schwab are actually updated in real-time in the desktop apps. \n\nTDA's ToS actually handles watch lists and charts in a bit of a wonky way because it's designed around options and futures trading. For example - common features like getting the tax lot cost basis in ToS is not available. Schwab SSE is geared more at stock and equity options traders - it's a lot easier to setup if you need watchlists, charts, realtime news, CNBC news, etc. \n\nThere are always going to be pros/cons depending on each broker's platform. \n\nIbkr TWS and TDA ToS are both Java based apps so they can have Java related performance issues.  But both offer better cross-platform compatibility for Linux, Mac, Windows. Schwab SSE only works on Mac and Windows. \n\nFidelity's ATP is more similar to Schwab SSE - but it's Windows only iirc. \n\nImho - making a decision on choice of brokers should really depend on the type of trading that you are doing and how actively you trade. And it's not just the trading platform - things like fees, execution quality, margin rules, etc. should be part of that decision. \n\nMost of r/investing isn't about trading which is why I find it odd that retail investors in this subreddit are finding the transition to Schwab to be an issue. \n\nMy own TDA accounts are scheduled to be transitioned in Q1 of 2024. The reason why I would move those accounts from Schwab is if their portfolio margin rules, option risk rules, or my negotiated fees change. And I'm told that none of those things will change.  In fact, Schwab has already modified the fee schedule on my Schwab accounts to match the fees on my TDA account ahead of the transition. Although, annoyingly, TDA was unwilling to rebate me certain fees which Schwab doesn't charge.",

Moved out to ally a couple of years ago because  they changed the unrealize/realized gains visibility  which really passed me off and at the time had no resolution in site. Plus got a big account bonus for the move. Shortly after  also opened a schwab and merril accounts as well, also for the bonuses. Eventually etrade as well. Of those 4 the only one that came close to that for me in terms of usability is ally. If tdameritrade ad a account bonus( haven't seen one in a couple years) I would probably  go back to tdameritrade assuming my original concern from years ago was since resolved. Barring that, I am content with ally.",

I usually only execute orders once per month and don't follow things very closely. The research tools usually fit my needs, but I'm aware of better ones out there. The app is handy if I want to check up on things. I look at it like the Walmart of financial services, nothing is either terrible or great, and they have everything you want all in one place.\n\nDid you know - 20 years ago you used to have to have $20k minimum to setup an appointment with a Schwab broker, and they were an actual person you went to meet in an office tower? You would put on a suit for this meeting if you wanted to be taken seriously, even then they would try and sell you garbage. Online trading sites were questionable at best and all trades were like $8-20 per. Man the times have changed, this is great and so easy.",

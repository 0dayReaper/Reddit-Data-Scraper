    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m a bit conflicted. I found a 2 family house that looks great for a rental property. I have to put down 20% which is around 150k. \n\nI did some ROI calculations and I expect to see around 6% returns from equity buildup. The cash on cash ROI is only like 1.2%. NJ property taxes suck so bad.\n\nAnyways, with word about housing market collapse.. should I leave all that capital in a hysa? I just opened one up recently and the interest is pretty good 4.2% compared to when I had it sitting in a 0.01% interest bank.\n\nPull the trigger or ride the hysa until the market comes down? Thanks!\n\noh im already also doing other stuff like maxing my 401k and roth ira!",

Without knowing more about your financial situation, I personally would stick to the HYSA at these rates, but it all depends on your risk tolerance/willingness to deal with renters.",

Don't believe the listing agent on your income potential (although any agent promising 1.2% CoC is probably at least honest?) . If your CoC is based on increasing rent not the rents in place and is that low then this to me is a hard pass. If you haven't added in maintenance (and especially if this is your first place), hard pass.\n\nIf there is good rent upside (not just when you take possession but if you are in a place where that has a good chance to be popular, etc.) and you want to be that guy that jacks up the rent then it's a maybe. But if this is your first house you have to really know that you want to be that guy. It's not easy.\n\nIf the CoC is really based on actual rent collected, long term, low hassle tenants and/or includes a management company then sure-ish. I probably wouldn't with so many other completely safe ways to park your cash right now.\n\nIf you are thinking about this as a live in one half rent the other the weight of the decision gets less based on the math. But it sounds like a pure investment from the way you've described it.",

    "postText": "If you've paid any attention to the financial news over the last 2 years, you've seen the questions and critiques about Warren Buffett's cash position. In almost every interview he's asked why is he stacking cash or why Berkshire isn't outperforming the S&amp;P 500. The majority of questions aren't as brazen, but rewatch some of his interviews and you'll see that 1 or 2 questions along those lines comes up. \n\nTake this article by CNBC from November of last year:\n\n*Being in the enviable position of having that much cash to spend seems unenviable at the moment, as far as Berkshire shareholders, and maybe even Buffett, are concerned. Buffett\u2019s company is currently on pace for its worst annual stock performance since 2009.*\n\n*\u201cHe pinned himself into a corner a few years ago, saying I can\u2019t have $150 billion in cash in three to four years and say that\u2019s alright,\u201d said Greggory Warren, a Morningstar analyst who covers Berkshire Hathaway.*\n\n*Underperformance versus the index, deals that have not worked out well, such as Kraft Heinz (thought it showed signs of life in its most recent earnings), and increasing willingness on Buffett\u2019s part to consider share buybacks, all point to the the importance of moving that cash into investments that generate a return.\"*\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/even-obvious-way-for-buffett-to-solve-big-cash-problem-is-a-puzzle.html\n\nI can spend all day finding each and every article from the past 2-3 years but you understand my point. \n\nAs stocks soared to all time highs, people wondered just as they did during the tech boom whether Buffett had lost his touch. Now Buffett is sitting on a 125+ Billion dollar mountain of cash just biding his time. He's poised more favorably than he could ever ask for, and prices are just getting more reasonable by the day.\n\nTLDR: When you see Buffett stacking cash, he's not an idiot. He's waiting for prices to become reasonable again, which only happens after a significant market decline. \n\nI'm not saying he's an oracle, but he's rarely wrong. If history is any indicator, Berkshire is going to reap some mighty rewards.",

Newsflash: *most people are not like Warren Buffet.* When you get very big, it's not so easy to move your fortune without moving the market. You are very illiquid, so you must plan ahead. So, in his context, piling up cash makes a lot of sense. Plus, he can always generate a lot of revenue, which can be reinvested aggressively. Even if his fortune was slashed in half, or 80%-90%, he'd probably still be faring very well.\n\nContrast that to the typical investor, which has e.g, $ 10,000 in savings. That person is very liquid and nimble, but his/her portfolio can get ravaged easily in markets like these.",

I don't have money like warren buffet but i live comfortably. I only bought stocks in depressed sectors and waited. Right now I am buying up all the oil and energy stocks. No clue how low it will go but I will be buying at these prices. Warren paid 40 a share for oxy I am paying 13 a share. Thats whats worked for me. buy in depressed markets and hold and wait. When the market is over bought i sell it and get another depressed sector that it something people need long term.  I dont look at charts or graphs or anything. I lok at etfs and see which ones they own the most of in that depressed sector and buy like the top 3 from portfolio. Its really that simple.",

I had just graduated with a Bachelor's.  I got two years paid for via my own efforts ([Running Start](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_Start) program in my state to get free college) and my parents helped cover the other two years.  So no student debt.\n\nI was also a saver in general, which helped.  I lived with my parents even after graduating for a while and just saved money, and when I did move out I got roommates even though I didn't need them.\n\nMy pay was much less than it would have been had I graduated at any other time as fresh out of college- and I think it set me back for most of my career- but I was lucky to have a job while everyone I know was being laid off.\n\nI also lived in a cheaper city that near, maybe slightly below, national median prices.  So by 2010, houses were $130k median.  Foreclosures in a below-median neighborhood could be as low as $50k without being complete trash.  Houses just sat on the market.\n\nSo we're talking about no debt, already had savings, and needing down payments of $10k-$15k.\n\nFinally, my parents had always been in to real estate investing and encouraged me and offered me guidance.  They looked at the foreclosures with me and helped me identify ones that could be done with minimum rehab (and I hired out the work).  So I had the education advantage.\n\n\n\n\nThe point is, though, that I happened to have the position to buy.  If I'd been in a different position, I couldn't have.  The same thing goes for richer people too.  If 99% of your net worth is in stocks when the recession hit, guess what?  You have no cash to buy things.  (Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc, etc.)\n\nIf your net worth is in cash or something else, or you had a high income, then you could buy up the failing businesses and sometimes make a fortune. (Steve Mnuchin, Mitt Romney, etc.)\n\n\nIt's not a \"the rich benefit when it crashes\" thing, it's a \"the people who have cash available benefit, and the people invested lose\" thing.",

Moreover Berkshire has recently purchased MORE DAL shares.\n\nMoreover, DAL and UAL are not currently distressed and both have extreme plans already in place for liquidity. UAL says they have $9B in liquidity, and DAL plans to have $5B by the end of the month. United themselves have an 18 month plan including and accounting for 70% decrease in demand in the next few months. They even made it a point to point out that much of their assets are currently unencumbered and they have avenues of liquidity they have not tapped unless necessary.\n\nThe reason why buffet was buying airlines in recent years is because of the strengths of their balance sheets and cash flow statements. And now it is because of these strengths that these two airlines believe they will in fact not have issues like in past crisis. If we go back through history (I in fact checked) the airlines were already in trouble BEFORE the market crashed last time. This time is completely different.\n\nIf Buffet decides he wants to buy more airlines shares, there will only be one reason and one reason only: He sees that the shares are trading at significant value compared to intrinsic value. It will not be to bail out the airlines or to provide them liquidity.\n\nTruth is, the airline equities right now are trading on FEAR just like the rest of the market. And as always, FEAR overrules everything in the market.",

Not sure what your point is here?\n\nBuffet often abides by a 10% rule and hardly ever breaks it. Delta has been a small exception to this rule. \n\n&gt;They're already flying empty airplanes around parts of the world with 0 passengers on board (unreported on freight numbers though) just to keep their departure time reservations. If domestic travel continues to tank down to where international travel is going, they're gonig to have massive overhead to cover and not a lot of revenue to pay for it with. These liquidity numbers are not all that large for the size of their operations.\n\nSure, I may be a little optimistic in my presentation of facts, but you are being entirely unrealistic. There is a difference between 0 revenue and a 70% decrease in revenue. Delta has already cut international flights by 20-25% and domestic by 10-15%, and likely now to cut even further. Not to mention that Delta acquires it's jet fuel from it's wholely owned subsidiary Monroe so they are entirely exposed to crude oil prices that have been halved for the next few foreseeable months.  \n\n\n&gt;But the fed has drastically increased repo window operations to try to keep credit market liquidity up, which in itself implies that they see future liquidity issues.\n\nYour logic here is flawed. Causation does not imply correlation. The fed increasing the repo window operations to keep credit market liquidity up before we actually have a liquidity crisis is the fed trying to insure one doesn't happen in the first place. Let's stick to the facts: Credit markets are and continue to be liquid. Interest rates are near zero.\n\nThe airlines WILL bleed. Nobody here is denying this. They will be operating at losses in the next few quarters for certain. But net loss does not mean total loss. Much of their expense may be fixed, but it does not mean there is no variable compenents to it.",

There are studies that show even when you do an okay job timing the market the money you lose out on sitting on cash almost always outruns the gains from trying to time.  Time in the market basically beats timing the market in all scenarios.  Especially over long time frames - 10+ years.  So, no, people who say not to time the market are NOT idiots.",

Warren won't come out and say the market is a bubble. He has used doublespeak because he knows investors listen to what he says and he doesn't want to be responsible for collapsing the market. His dad was a politician and he is smart enough to know that you don't want to be blamed for market declines. His reputation is important and Berkshire has hundreds of billions of dollars in stocks invested that he wants to maintain value.\n\nAfter things blow up and the dust settles he will come out and talk about all the foolish and stupid things investors were doing. He probably knew they were doing stupid stuff all along, but he has to keep his lips closed.\n\nAt the end of the day, he knew the market was overvalued and was sitting on cash. \n\nThus you should watch what Warren Buffett does, not what he says.",

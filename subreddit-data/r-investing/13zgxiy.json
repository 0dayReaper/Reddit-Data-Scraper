    "postText": "I was wondering what everyone's opinions were of Fidelity's total market index funds, specifically the zero expense fund, FZROX.\n\nIt makes up a majority of my Roth IRA with about 10% being in the international market fund. I figured since FZROX was a total market index it would match other total market index funds pretty well, but I've been thinking maybe putting it in VTI would be better?",

If I recall correctly, the weight difference of Apple alone is bigger than the ER difference of VTI and FZROX (possibly other companies as well, I'm not sure how far down you'd have to go before you find the first company where that isn't the case).\n\n0.20% vs 0.60% is 3x, but a 40 basis point difference, that's quite big. 0.02% vs 0.06% is also 3x, but an ignorable 4 basis point difference.",

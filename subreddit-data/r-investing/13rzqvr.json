    "postText": "I currently have the 2003 Edition with a commentary of Jason Zweig, and some said this made the book's content more complicated to read as he put all the footnotes of Graham himself to the end of the book. And he put new footnotes.\n\nSome other suggest the 1965 and 1973 edition with Warren Buffett, and I cant find any PDF so far.\nI would like to read the book from a perspective of Benjamin Graham himself.\n\nDoes anyone have older edition copies?",

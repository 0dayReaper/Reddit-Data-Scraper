Sueing the SEC seems like another way to stifle access to information for retail investors disguised as a means to protect them.\n\nI have a lot of bias right now against institutional entities and I'm interested in what people have to say about this and whether or not this is more sensational news for clicks. I couldn't find a source with specifics about what the SECs overhaul would look like so I'm torn on how I feel about this.\n\nEdit: For those seeking further context, look through some of the great discussions in the comments!",

They make good money selling this data to HFTs and the like.\n\nI'm not entire sure what data would become publicly available, but I assume it's level 2 data or something alike.\n\n The \"overly complex and more expensive\" line seems like bs to me. Sure, some people might not know what they'd be looking at, but that's already the case now with a lot of available data (have you seen the language they use in sec filings?). \n\nAnd how it would increase cost is beyond me, unless the exchanges themselves inceare prices for basic data (so this is just a red herring).\n\nBut would also love other's input as I'm not a market specialist by any means.",

Meaning at any time for a single security you and I can see the bid and ask price, and the last trade.\n\nDepth of book is a series of different prices and volumes people are willing to pay.\n\nEx. I want to sell 200 apples, I see the Bid price someone is willing to buy from me as $50. \nThat could be misleading. If I see the order book/depth of book I would notice someone is willing to buy 2 shares at 50, then the next person is willing to buy 98 shares at $48, then the next person has a bid at $40 for 200 shares.\n\nMeaning I end up selling my shares at around $45 instead of the $50 I thought.\n\nIt is also how at one moment someone bought GME at over $1000\n\nThey said something like \"buy the 500 cheapest shares in the market\" but there were 300 at $400 and the next one's were $1000 (I'm imagining here)\n\nWhich is why you should put a price limit when entering an order",

Currently Robinhood, E*Trade, et al, can offer \u201cfree\u201d trades because you as the user are the product.  They are selling your trades and general user data to HFTs so that you are put at an immediate disadvantage.  If all of that data become publicly available then there would be no source of income from the HFTs and therefore trade commissions would return to these brokers.\n\nIt\u2019s all a bunch of bullshit.  These \u201cfree\u201d brokers are screwing their users.  They offer worse pricing on every trade and by selling the user data and order flow they are giving the hedge funds the ability to always optimize their own profits.  Paying commission fees with a broker that doesn\u2019t sell order flow is significantly cheaper in the long run.",

Retail order flow is more valuable than institutional (partly because they're less informed and the MM is like likely to be on the wrong side of the trade). Market makers and hedge funds are two different things but the MM is providing a service to both sides by creating liquidity.\n\nDoes there need to be rules and regulations to protect retail investors? Yes. Are HFTs universally bad? Absolutely not. Is PFOF bad? Only if your broker isn't giving rebates to you and improving your pricing. Hard for me to see any issues when I place a marketable order and it clears for better than bid/ask midpoint.",

The new rules expand the content of NMS market data to include:\n\n1. information about orders in share amounts smaller than the current round lot size (e.g., 100 shares);\n\n2.  information about certain orders that are outside of an exchange\u2019s best bid and best offer (i.e., certain depth of book data); and\n\n3. information about orders that are participating in opening, closing, and other auctions.\n\nAlso:\nCompeting consolidators, rather than the existing exclusive SIPs, will collect, consolidate, and disseminate certain NMS information.\n\nIt was adopted in December. They should be effective in 60 days, but a phased transition plan begins in 2021 to avoid chaos.\n\nSources:\n\n[Traders magazine](https://www.tradersmagazine.com/am/industry-supports-sec-market-data-rule/)\n\n[Odd lots definition](https://www.investopedia.com/odd-lot-trading-on-the-rise-4774753)\n\n[SEC's statement](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-lee-infrastructure-2020-02-14#_ftn6) on the issue.\n\n&gt; The proposed rule would add depth-of-book, odd-lot, and auction information to what would be defined as \u201ccore data\u201d required to be provided in the SIP.\n\n[The possible implications](https://www.tradersmagazine.com/departments/commentary/nms-ii-an-odd-solution-for-the-odd-lot-problem/) discussed briefly.\n\n&gt;The U.S. market has an \u201c odd lot problem.\u201d That\u2019s because 100 shares of AMZN (for example), at over $200,000 not only qualifies for block size but is multiples larger than the average trade or best bid value. So what tends to happen is that algos and individual investors bid for smaller values of AMZN, creating an \u201cinsiders\u201d market at better prices than the NBBO shows.\n\n\n&gt;One problem with this is that investors and brokers using the SIP won\u2019t know that there are small buyers and sellers at slightly better prices in the market.",

You trade 10 shares of amzn, you'll get NBBO, but they are getting a little better than NBBO, because the market for 10 shares is alot more liquid than the market for 100 shares.",

You could also run a laptop mining bitcoin with just CPU (I caught the end of that and everything was moving to GPUs). Unfortunately, like many, your introduction to the space is short lived as it seems like a cool idea but not really fathomable. \n\nThe run to $4 is when my attention on Bitcoin was captured again. I eventually grew the testicular fortitude(took almost a full year to convince myself, but did lots of research/tinkering/learning in that year). and went to my bank and wired money to Mt Gox. My teller tried her best to talk me out of it as once it was sent it was as good as gone (she could see my account balance at the time lol).\n\nAfter almost a full week, my funds ended up in Mt.Gox, and the rest is history. Mt.Gox we all called \"The King\" back then, because it did something like 90% of the trading volume for all of Bitcoin. Over time, more options appeared and just spread out to hedge exchange risk (which proved to be one of my best moves ever as Mt.Gox imploded).",

I have spent a decent portion of my career in education industry, so I am really jaded about information being put behind paywalls. I have never seen a case where opening up information to the public has been harmful to the public.\n\nYour example already happens. The libraries do pay the premium and are able to afford it by sharing resources, meaning it may take longer to borrow the book or media, but you will eventually be able to. \n\nIn fact people have told me some libraries now have open access Bloomberg terminals. I live in a somewhat rural area, so I haven't seen one in a library myself, but that is great if true. (Especially if they also have a mathematica license)",

And I can understand the natural inclination to sort of increase access to things on all fronts.\n\nPretty fair point that libraries do stuff like that already. I guess then to me this situation feels like it's mostly some new guy in town rushing into the library demanding a special subscription to something that the other people in town who use it just pay for themselves, and there's a high likelihood this guy loses interest and leaves by the time they go and get it.\n\nIt's a pessimistic view but let's be real, a lot of people posting are themselves saying they've got a few months of experience trading and demanding this or that transparency or making big corruption claims when they've barely got the lay of the land on what's going on around them.",

I guess my whole argument boils down to finding the data useless for the most part, except maybe for some very specialized traders. And it is frustrating seeing people shake faith in the markets based off bad interpretations of that same data. That's the biggest issue in my mind, the \"rigged game\" sentiment.\n\nI just think that active retail traders, whether they know it or not, are complaining about something most other retail participants in the market don't care at all about. And in pushing for something like this they're asking others to foot even a small bill for something they plan on trying to make  money off of.\n\nI like the testing idea, I wonder how that would be received by people taking it. \"Where's the question on short ladder attacks!\"",

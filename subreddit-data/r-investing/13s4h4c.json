    "postText": "Hey all, I didn\u2019t sell my Tata motors shares in time before they delisted (Major health problems kept my mind elsewhere). I am a bit confused on how this works. In this post on https://www.tatamotors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/frequently-asked-questions-delisting-and-deregistration-of-american-depository-shares.pdf they stated will sell the shares and and I will net proceeds then taxes are out or will they take 40% of gross proceeds. Sorry, I am pretty new to this",

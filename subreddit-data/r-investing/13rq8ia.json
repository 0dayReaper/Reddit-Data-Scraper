    "postText": "My wife and I both received promotions this spring and our disposable income will go up a pretty good amount. We have saved for our son with a bank account, and his grandparents have funded a 529 as well. I am wondering what would be the best way to start investing for him? \n\nI would prefer to use a brokerage account that he could use as a down payment in in 20s, but everywhere I look they do not allow it until they reach 16-18 years old. I even looked at opening a joint TOD account but it would not allow it. \n\nI have seen UTMA/UGMA, but I don\u2019t like it for two reasons, I don\u2019t want him to take complete control of it at 18, and I don\u2019t want it to penalize him when he looks at colleges and have it count against his FAFSA score. \n\nIs there any other better options for me to start saving in? I am looking at (roughly) $50/month. Planning to invest in VT / VOO or comparable Mutual Fund.",

That also gives you the option to use those funds for another purpose if something unexpected happens and you fall on hard times. \n\nOnce he's out of college and presumably getting on with his life, you can help him in other ways, such as direct monetary gifts and/or helping with the down payment on his first house, or even topping off his IRA if he has a bad year. \n\nBasically, the most impactful thing you can do to help him is to ensure your own long-term financial security and prosperity.",

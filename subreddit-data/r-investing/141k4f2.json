    "postText": "So Schwab has the above listed product that will invest your money for you based on risk tolerance and time horizon.  Seems pretty good if I'm not as active as I should be with my investments.  Does anyone have any experience with this product and can give pros and cons.  I know you just let them do the investing, rebalancing, and tax loss harvesting,",

They upped the interest rate on the cash position, it's not as bad as it used to be.\n\n\nCons: the cash position is still pretty large, ~7% at the most aggressive.\n\nThe makeup of the portfolio itself is fairly diversified, though between the cash and bond position, it is pretty heavy into cash equivalents.\n\nI offset the cash drag by going heavy in other portfolios. I consider my entire net worth as one portfolio and have adjusted my entire cash/bond position accordingly",

The only way I\u2019ve pulled money out is to drain the cash position and when that goes under 10% of the portfolio, it\u2019ll just sell some from the equities funds and FI funds to re-level. \n\nTo completely exit, I think you\u2019d wanna call Schwab and they\u2019ll cash  you out but you\u2019ll be on the hook for taxes on capital gains (or be able to harvest losses, if that\u2019s the case). \n\nEverything is in ETF\u2019s. If you don\u2019t think you\u2019d like it due to lack of control beyond the few tuning knobs, might be best to just invest on your own. \n\nI\u2019m not going to touch my SIP just because I don\u2019t wanna deal with the tax-fermath (lol).",

Also it is essentially free (they hold your cash at below market rate which is about 7-9 basis points of drag) vs 25-35 for most similar services. Strong recommend.  I'd check out Wealthfront as IMHO the only superior option for both sexes. and add Ellevest if you are female. Betterment is the most popular but IMHO an inferior portfolio.",

Most thought buying S&amp;P 500 or all US stock is diversified enough and they lost almost -20% in 2022. Bulkt of the movements attrubute to just 6-10 tech stocks. If they rise that is great. But the performed horribly when the interest rose.  Most investors do not understand good portfolio is not fully invested.  Bonds today do not hedge stocks. There used to be a better fund family called Amerivest.  It is still around. Based on risk tolerance level one used to get actively managed.  However, it is not take in any more customers.",

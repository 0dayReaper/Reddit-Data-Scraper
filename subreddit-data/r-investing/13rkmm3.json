Since a BOD\u2019s primary role is to ensure the company\u2019s shareholders are taken care of, why would the CEOs of other companies care about the success of other companies? I thought it was a dog eat dog world in the business world?",

Its somewhat also sometimes good to get out side perspectives and experience .  \n\nHowever to your point Xerox does not really compete with Target or GM. Xerox makes printers / copiers and imaging solutions ; those other companies are not competing in that space.\n\nIn other cases I do seem to remember some BOD resigning if the companies do get into some competition for a conflict of interest .

There is some truth to this.\n\nHowever, it's also a form of collusion. It\u2019s a part of how socioeconomic elites maintain their power and wealth. CEO A who\u2019s a board member of a corporation led by CEO B, votes to give CEO B an ungodly pay package because CEO A\u2019s own pay package is voted on by their fellow CEOs in return. So it is very directly in the personal interest of CEO A to invite CEOs B, C, D, E, etc. to act as directors for their own corporation, because they all have a mutual interest in compensating one another massively, regardless of the fact that their companies may technically be in competition with one another. At the level of their individual interest, they are best served by collaborating with one another to mutually raise CEO pay as board members of one anothers' companies.\n\nIt's like Congress voting to give themselves raises. All parties tend to come together on that, regardless of their differences on education or social media or whatever, all parties tend to agree that they deserve to give themselves a raise when it comes time to vote on it. So while the companies run by CEOs A, B, C, etc. may be \u2018competitors\u2019 with one another in the same way Democrat and Republican Senators are competitors, their individual interests are best served by cooperating on the key issue of how to compensate themselves.\n\nThe managerial class in each company has common and collective interests with one another, regardless of whether their businesses are competitors or not, which are pursued through these incestuous relationships.",

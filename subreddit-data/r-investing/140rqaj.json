It\u2019s lowered the prices of houses somewhat but not by a lot in my area. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of a multi unit (3) property but the rates are about 7% so it\u2019s sort of a risk and maybe rents come down. \n\nAlso not sure how much would banks refinance later on once rates go down back to like 2-3%. \n\nI already have stocks and bonds so wanted to see if investing in real estate now makes sense when it\u2019s like the tail end of the time when real estate was booming. (Yep, like for a decade and now in going in).",

It took a global pandemic to bring the rates down to that level a few years ago, and nobody saw that coming. Before the pandemic, when was the last time rates were that low?\nIt could be another decade or two before we see rates drop that low, so taking that into consideration would probably be wise..",

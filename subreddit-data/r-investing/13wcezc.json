    "postText": "I'm thinking of putting most of my cash into Treasury Bills for now while yields are still relatively high. However, I heard new Treasury Bills that get issued in the weeks after the debt ceiling deal passes may have a higher yield.\n\nI'm debating whether I should buy the T-bills now or wait a few weeks, or at least next week, until the bill passes.\n\nI'm thinking of setting up a T-bill ladder of 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 13 weeks.",

            "comment": "I mean the interest you earn in the two weeks you waited will prob be the same as the new yield you would be getting.  Bet it\u2019s a wash.  \n\nUs debt is like the first thing that gets paid so it\u2019s not like they will default on your bills.  I\u2019d just get them now.  \n\nI just sort of did the math and 2 weeks of interest on 100k would be like $207.  3mo tbill in the next 76 days (cause you waited 2 weeks) will yield $1353 @ 6.5% (which I feel is generous interest rate).  Current t bill would yield $1331 over 90 days @ 5.4%.  So you are honestly gambling to make an extra $20 but if the interest rate doesn\u2019t change or doesn\u2019t jump to 6.5 then you \u201close\u201d 100\u2019s of dollars.",

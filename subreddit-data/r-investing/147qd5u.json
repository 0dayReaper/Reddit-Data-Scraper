The advisor pointed out my 401k was heavy in redundant assets and was biased towards a target date fund that historically doesn\u2019t perform as well as some other investments might. \n\nMy question is do most of you self manage your own 401k and if you do are you more cautious or diversified with that vs non-retirement specific investments?",

                    "comment": "Yep. Warren Buffet recommends* keeping 90% of your portfolio in an index fund that tracks the S&amp;P 500 and 10% in cash (edit: technically short-term govt bonds, which I consider cash equivalent\u2014extremely low risk, very low return, very liquid). Periodically rebalance. \n\nSo, if the market goes down, your index fund will lose value but cash won\u2019t, so your cash percentage will be higher (say 15% instead of 10%). You should take some of the cash and buy more shares of the index fund to get back to 90:10.  And do the opposite if the market runs up making you more like 93:7 (you don\u2019t necessarily have to sell, just allocate more of your contributions to cash). \n\nThis isn\u2019t timing the market by most definitions. You have a target portfolio balance and maintain it over time regardless of what the market does. But it does have the effect of causing you to buy more when the market is down and to sell/buy less when the market is higher. \n\nIdk if that\u2019s the best strategy for OP or for 401Ks in general, but that\u2019s the recommendation* of one of the wisest investors out there. And it\u2019s not just some survivorship bias nonsense from someone saying this is how they got rich. It\u2019s not how Buffet got rich or how he invests his own or BH\u2019s money. But it is how he has his family\u2019s trusts set up, I believe. And it\u2019s very sound investing advice.\n\nETA: This is a variation of the older stocks and bonds rebalancing (eg, 60/40). Bonds were generally safer, less volatile than stocks but provided less return over the long run. The bonds provide a hedge. And as a plus, stocks and bonds tended to perform somewhat inverse of each other. So if one was up and the other down, you\u2019d have to rebalance to get back to 60/40 which means selling some of what\u2019s up and buying what\u2019s down. Ignoring transaction costs, that\u2019s likely to outperform just holding without rebalancing. But bonds don\u2019t always inverse the market anymore and haven\u2019t really been the best investment for us retail plebes in a while. That\u2019s why Buffett chose to go just cash (technically short-term govt bonds) (but only 10%, as opposed to say 30-40% bond allocations).\n\nE2: * let me just clarify that Buffett hasn\u2019t explicitly \u201crecommended\u201d this portfolio structure to the general public. He revealed publicly that it\u2019s how he set up the trust(s) for his wife and/or family. He\u2019s been public about recommending most people invest primarily in low-cost index funds. He\u2019s a smart guy and isn\u2019t going to give specific investment advice to the public generally, but revealing the strategy he set out for his trustee to follow is probably the closest thing you\u2019d get to a recommendation from Buffett. At a minimum, you could say it\u2019s a portfolio structure he\u2019s endorsed. Also, I said \u201ccash\u201d but meant an equivalent (very safe, very liquid, some interest). Buffett\u2019s trusts use short-term govt bonds.",

Depending on when/how often you rebalance, it does allow you to acquire more shares during market corrections (using not only contributions but also rebalancing cash into shares). And it also allows for some profit taking when the market runs up quickly. \n\nOver the long run, I don\u2019t know if that gives a higher ROI than always being 100% S&amp;P. I\u2019m sure somebody has back tested that. I haven\u2019t looked. But if it does outperform 100% S&amp;P, that\u2019s def one reason to have some cash even if young. \n\nIf it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019d be important to know by how much. If it\u2019s not a massive difference, it might be valuable to keep some cash anyway, because you could potentially need to tap it. It preserves some portfolio value in a recession and also allows you to use some without selling assets that are down. It\u2019s not ideal, but when times are tough, it\u2019s prob better than alternatives. And there are usually some ways to avoid early withdrawal penalties (eg, withdrawing Roth contributions/seasoned rollovers, loans, special legal provisions for specific reasons, etc.). \n\nSo, I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s \u201cno reason.\u201d Also, if you\u2019re interested in FIRE, being under 50 doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t retired or nearing retirement. There are ways to start tapping the money early (eg, Roth conversion ladders).",

You're purposely keeping funds liquid so you can buy more shares when you think the pricing is more favorable. That's timing the market.\n\nI get what you're saying about how if stocks drop then your allocation of cash/stocks, and an auto rebalance would kick in you buying more shares, but on the flip side, as stocks rise, you're going to be putting more of your contributions into cash. If you can't access the money for 10, 20, 30 years, it doesn't make like any sense to have that much of your portfolio in cash. Just DCA with your contributions. \n\nIf you breakdown most of the funds you're investing in, a lot have a few percentage in cash exposure (even some of the more aggressive ones like CPOAX have ~2% cash exposure). Now, I know this isn't you actually holding cash in your 401k/ira/whatever, but keeping 10% in cash/cash equivalents could result you having upwards of 20% of your portfolio in cash.

You\u2019ve always got 90% in stocks. \n\nI\u2019m saying the effect of keeping the balance at 90/10 is more buying at lower prices and less buying/more selling at higher prices. But that\u2019s just the side effect. \n\nThis is no different than a Boglehead 60/40 portfolio that\u2019s 60% stocks and 40% bonds. The idea is when one is down, the other usually isn\u2019t and you rebalance to get back to 60/40. The result is you\u2019re buying more of what\u2019s down and selling what\u2019s up to rebalance. \n\nIt\u2019s just that only 60% is probably too low for stock exposure and bonds don\u2019t really perform like they used to and can also be down when stocks are down, negating the main benefit of the strategy. Cash (or equivalents) is safer than bonds and you\u2019re not really giving up much return compared to what bonds pay these days (plus you\u2019re allocating only 10% instead of 40% to this lower performing asset). \n\nIt\u2019s the same thing, but because it\u2019s cash instead of bonds that\u2019s somehow \u201ctrying to time the market.\u201d It\u2019s not.",

A 100% S&amp;P 500 would backtest better than 90/10.  A 3x leveraged ETF of the S&amp;P 500 would backtest better still, but I certainly wouldn't recommend a person put all their assets in such a fund.   The difference is increased variance.   Investors require a higher average expected return to compensate for the increased risk of a higher variance portfolio.   If a higher expected variance portfolio doesn't have a higher expected average return, you are doing something wrong.\n\nThis makes the optimal portfolio a question of balance risk/variance vs average expected gains.   A person with a higher risk tolerance (often younger persons who are far from retirement) would typically choose a higher variance portfolio with the largest expected gains.  A person with a lower risk tolerance (often persons who are near retirement date) would typically choose a lower variance portfolio, with less risk of swings in portfolio balance.\n\nWhile the specific numbers vary with the specific portfolio and timeline, there is often a far lower risk of running out of funds during retirement with a portfolio weighted more towards lower variance than one with 90/10.   You can find some example numbers at [https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/beyond-4-rule-how-much-can-you-spend-retirement](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/beyond-4-rule-how-much-can-you-spend-retirement) (among countless other sites).   In the pictured examples, the average return is far higher after 30 years of retirement with a high variance portfolio than low variance, but the lowest balance after 30 years is also substantially lower:  bottom 10th percentile return of $241k decrease with \"convservative\" portfolio vs bottom 10th percentile return of  $655k decrease with \"moderately aggressive\" portfolio.",

Market is up, you\u2019re buying less to stay 90/10. Market is down, you\u2019re buying more to stay 90/10. \n\nI think people are just thrown off because one allocation is cash. If you made a portfolio that was, say, 60% large cap, 25% small cap, and 15% international, you\u2019re fully invested at all times\u2014no cash. But unless those funds all perform identically, you\u2019re going to be buying more of the funds that are down and selling (or buying less) of the funds that are up, in order to maintain that balance. And if the disparity is a lot, you\u2019re going to sell one allocation to buy more of the other. That\u2019s not timing the market. It\u2019s buying more of something that\u2019s down and selling something that\u2019s up, but it\u2019s not timing anything. It\u2019s maintaining the portfolio balance of exposure to different companies. \n\nYou could argue that not rebalancing is more of timing the market. You\u2019re moving away from your stated goal and trying to ride the hot hand in a sense. You\u2019re letting international get up to 18% and sticking with it (for example). Why? Because you\u2019re trying to predict the future? You\u2019re guessing international will continue to outperform? Isn\u2019t that more of trying to time the market than selling some international, which is up, to rebalance to 15%, and buying more small cap, which is down, to bring it up to 25%?",

I think vanguard publishes a piece on the statistics behind this (maybe someone can link it).  Pilots and doctors are notorious for underperformance.  Being a high earner and smart in one field doesn\u2019t really translate to being smart at investment management. If you have a self directed option then that\u2019s great but I\u2019d recommend investing a majority of the money into the various low cost index funds.  By doing this you\u2019re already outperforming most funds in your 401k lineup due to the lower cost.\n\nI work in the space at one of the worlds largest 401k providers. It\u2019s interesting work.",

Most 401k plans have a version of SPY. \n\nSPY will enable you participate in 500 of the biggest companies in the world. The embedded management fees for SPY is very low and SPY has returned an average of 10% in the last 10 years. \n\nWith the preponderance of index funds and ETFs, one does not need to be sophisticated to participate in the financial markets. Just put your money in funds like SPY or ITOT and forget about it. Stop chasing returns.",

The S&amp;P 500 is so prevalent that most assign it a beta of 1, meaning that they're using it as the proxy for total market risk/correlation. I see a lot of people recommend some kind of total stock market index and I personally do not think the financial metrics line up in favor of that over the S&amp;P 500.",

Arithmetic avg 9.1% return, CAGR is 8.3%, which is a reasonable outcome, especially as the last year knocked it down quite a bit, plus I have a healthy chunk of allocation to International stocks.   \n\nOur advisor-managed (non 401k) investments provided negative returns over-all, and I transferred that to self-managed decades ago.\n\nSo yes, self-management can be done just fine.  Advisors don't always know best, though sometimes they do.  They can be useful to stop you from selling, and yes, to prevent unwarranted skew across your funds.  A good advisor will also identify funds with high fees to disinvest from, and mention the trade-offs in building your portfolio, so you have some input.\n\nHowever, one has to have some idea what they're doing if you DIY.   \n\nIf you build a three-fund portfolio, skew it for your age &amp; aggressiveness, you could hold that for a few years until you learn more (and maybe long after that, a three funder is simple but powerful.)  You can google three fund portfolio, and there should be a Boglehead site that has plenty of resources.\n\nAlso, Asset redundancy is not a great thing, but isn't always terrible.

At your stage of the game do your own due diligence and find out what risk tolerance you want to take with your retirement savings + estimated timeline. Once you do that, find a portfolio model with low expense ratios to help you achieve that.\n\nTarget date funds are the greyhound bus of investing, it will get you to the city you want to be in but not drop you off at your doorstep. If you want a more personalized approach then what a TDF has to offer then you\u2019ll need to do some of your own research.",

    "postText": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/06/covid-stimulus-update-senate-passes-1point9-trillion-relief-bill.html\n\n\nThe US Senate just passed the 1.9T pandemic relief bill after negotiating with a centrist Democrat for the final vote to break the 50-50 tie.\n\nAfter a month of a downtrend in equities, on Friday, markets rallied into the green. I expect that this bill will likely be a catalyst that kicks markets off next week further into green territory as more households, especially those who are making less than 70k per year can anticipate a 1400 check in the coming weeks",

It isn\u2019t its own currency.  When, for example, the Tesla MY LR costs 1 BTC, and BTC no longer changes value in USD then it\u2019s its own currency.  I really can\u2019t see that happening, at least to where it\u2019s not tied to the dollar. I believe in the crypto ecosystem, but I can\u2019t figure out how it separates itself from fiat and still holds value to exchange for assets.",

What I\u2019m getting at is people have the sentiment that the dollar is a scam and somehow BTC could exist and have value even if the dollar goes to shit. Maybe it could, but as long as its value is based on the dollar or other currencies, and the dollar is such an important part of world economics, it seems BTC is still riding the wake. The fact it\u2019s so volatile when the dollar is (has been ) stable means it\u2019s still totally unsettled. I don\u2019t see how that changes. Maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding some people when they seem to think crypto can overtake fiat. I think they are missing the point. I think defi can take over banks, etc. but, at least in my lifetime, without the dollar, how can BTC even have value?  Hope to see that day, if it happens.",

Buying things for .00014321 BTC would suck, but some 10000:1 stable coin and an agreement to round at a certain point makes it much more feasible.\n\nIE, your net worth is measured in BTC, but you transact in DerivedCoin or whatever.\n\nI know a global currency makes a lot of people nervous, but man, I\u2019d love to have one.

Thus, this loan creates 100,000 - x dollars of new money, where x is the money held in reserve by the bank. \n\nIn 2020, there was 16 trillion USD in mortgage debt alone in the US, and a similar amount of corporate bonds. \n\nThe US government creating 1.9T USD, while not insignificant, is a fraction of the US currency created by commercial bank lending.\n\nAdjusting interest rates would have a larger impact in the rate of new money creation compared to this bill. However, you don\u2019t hear people freaking out when the fed cuts rates by 0.25%, despite that having a significantly larger impact on the rate of new money creation than this.",

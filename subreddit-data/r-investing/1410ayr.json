    "postText": "Spouse is just finishing post-secondary and will be able to easily find well-paying (middle-class) jobs with ease based on all the postings constantly up where we are moving. As for me, I have a solid job with a good pension and a 5+ year posting that is pretty much guaranteed.  \n\n\nthis budget is both towards retirement RRSP (Canada 401k) and a down-payment on a home through a TFSA. So roughly half of this annual amount would be for long-term (25-35 year horizon) savings and the rest for 2-4 years for the TFSA.  \n\n\nMy reasoning by continuing to do dollar cost averaging with both ETFs/Index Funds as well as blue-chip stocks is that even though there is a lot of overlap, I am hoping to sell from time to time when the individually owned stocks outperform the funds or ETF's to pad and accelerate the TFSA and get our downpayment quicker.   \n\n\nI may be completely out to lunch by overthinking the portfolio and trying to time the market. The DCA is planned to be quarterly for my own ease (I understand monthly might ultimately be the most profitable).\n\n**Portfolio Strategy\tAnnual Budget**\r  \nHigh-Risk Stocks\t        $800.00\r  \nBlue-Chip Stocks\t        $1,400.00\r  \nETF\t                                $2,500.00\r  \nIndex Fund\t                $2,500.00\r  \nT-Bills/Bonds \t        $1,200.00\r  \nTotal\t                        $8,400.00",

            "comment": "Agree with the other poster. The money that you need in 2-4 years is better off in a GIC/short dated bills/something more cash equivalent That's a very short time window investing wise and its a critical expense that absolutely needs to be there when you need the money in 2-4 years.\n\nUnless you're putting in the basic legwork like listening to quarterly reports and keeping up on sector news (or paying someone who does this for you), then stock picking is almost assuredly negative expected value. Probably better ito move that allocation to an index/thematic ETF vs individual tickers.\n\nSelling winners when they outperform is a more meaningful choice than you might realize. It gets into portfolio rebalancing/rebalancing premium concepts. You're also sort of just running a weird call overwriting strategy on the high beta assets... Actually, harvesting realized upside volatility on mean reverting assets is the basis of a quant trading strat called volatility pumping, but you need to be picking your assets carefully (watching correlations within the portfolio, among other things) to ensure this has an expected premium for you.\n\nIn practice though, unless you are systematically defining \"outperforming the index\" and exactly know how you take profit and when, then you're just throwing dice. Remember, higher risk stocks have higher beta/volatility, and they are *expected* to often outperform (and underperform) as they have a higher variance. You are harvesting the upside variance, but guess what, if they tank you're on the hook for 100% of the losses. This is a very different risk profile than straight equity ownership and thus your portfolio should probably be adjusted to account for the variance harvesting you plan to do on the high beta names (probably by adding some positive convexity somewhere). You're also killing some of the momentum factor which is an easy source of alpha/returns, so if you're not being properly compensated for harvesting the runners (ie if you're not putting thought into how to do this systematically) then it's negative expected value.\n\nIf you *were* to intelligently pursue selling the outperforming runners, the best way to do it would be to sell calls against them. Then you skip actively trading the realized volatility and just take cash up front from implied volatility (which is fairly priced out by market participants). This is actually conceptually much cleaner and safer from a returns perspective than discretionary selling of names you think are \"overvalued\", despite involving (very basic use of) options.\n\nIf I was planning on systematically selling runners in a longer term structured portfolio based on quantified metrics for \"overvalued\", I'd be graphing out probability distributions and pulling up some papers to read the existing literature, that's all I'm saying, lol. I think most non-quant portfolio managers would just sell calls on the names!\n\nOr better yet, just do a portfolio level rebalancing strategy that applies to all assets. Just buy and sell with intent to move back to a set allocation once a year - this is easy and works well.\n\nHope that was fun to think about. Selling winners intelligently is one of the hardest parts of active trading by the way. Buffett for example knows with high confidence he only holds winners, so he avoids the practice entirely as it introduces unwanted dice rolls.",

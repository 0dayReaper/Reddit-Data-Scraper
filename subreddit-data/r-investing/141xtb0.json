What made you pull the trigger and what did you learn from it?\n\nI am absorbing a ton of literature and I am feeling extremely gun shy on making my first buy (or selling any of the assets my dad gave me to get my feet wet). I would like to hear your stories to understand your reference frames and maybe take some of the anxiety out of this whole endeavor. \n\nThanks!",

When it went to $128, my friends suggested me (in fact warned me sell it and take profit). Seeing more than double profit, scared and took profit.\n\n&gt;what did you learn from it?\n\nNever listen to any third party advice, do your own DD!",

Two years later they had a little meme surge and I sold it all at $65 per share. It would later peak at 90 per share. Which sucks, but I don't regret it. The stock has comparatively been in ruin ever since.",

            "comment": "My first trade was fairly boring - $500 into GE back in the mid-90's right as it was starting to take off (yes I'm old). It was really good for a while (x6 in value in about 3 years). From it I learned that even dominant companies can fall or flounder. When they do, sell and move on. \n\nIt would be just as fun to ask people their worst trade or most interesting trade. Worst trade - buying Delta Airlines stock right after 9/11. Just because a good company's stock has dropped really low doesn't always mean its a bargain. It can head all the way to zero/bankruptcy. I ditched before zero, but ate a nice loss. Most interesting trade - buying Petro Kazakhstan (Canadian oil exploration company) right before they were bought out by PetroChina. Made a near instant 45% return by complete dumb luck.   \n\nOne final thought - I stick to the general rule that individual stocks should only be up to 5-10% of your holdings, with the vast majority in index funds and similar diversified investments. \n\nGood luck!",

Today, total is huge I cannot afford to liquidate them from a taxable account.\n\nThe argument is one needs diapers and bandages daily. The need of detergent, shave do not stop.

They ran up a bunch more before eventually failing\n\nMy first big trade was solar city I bought after it dropped like 50% betting on a bailout by telsa and I was right , sold at like 400% gains but if I would have held it would be like 4000% gains.\n\nHonestly I really don't do that any more and stick mostly to boring index funds for the last 5+ years",

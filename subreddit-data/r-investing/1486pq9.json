    "postText": "\nI am considering investing in an actively managed factor based actively managed ETF imagine $DEEP or EYLD \n\nMy biggest hesitancy is the .6-.8% expense ratio but I have started to wonder how etf's tax advantage may meaningfully make up for the expense \n\nso ultimately in general Is the tax advantage of actively managed ETF's meaningfully vs having to pay capital gains if you were to self apply a factor based strategy with yearly turnover?\n\nAnd if you have a deep understanding of this topic could you please explain it in as simple of language as you can\n\nMy very basic understanding from you tube is that mutual fund even passive ones pass on capital gains taxes when they have any sort of turnover and for any dividends. I have heard that ETF's can have turnover but it might be considered something like \"transfer in kind\".\n\nI appreciate this is a complex question but thank you in advance for the consideration.",

What makes actively managed funds appealing to you?\n\nPassively managed index funds include ETFs and mutual funds. You are correct that mutual funds will pay a distribution, which is taxes as capital gains, and ETFs will not. It is not related to turnover, but rather growth. You should still look for low turnover (as you lose money to spread/ transaction costs every time assets are bought or sold).\n\nPut simply:\n\nLow expense ratio good.\nLow turnover good.\nIndex funds are mutual funds and ETFs.\nIn a tax-advantaged account go with whatever has the lower expense ratio and turnover.\nIn a standard brokerage go with the ETF with the lower expense ratio and turnover.\nDon\u2019t look for the needle in the haystack, buy the haystack (index fund).",

There you can see details for 2022 distributions regarding qualified dividends, capital gains distributions, etc. Also, if an ETF has very high turnover in excess of 100% that could result in tax implications.",

And usually its a very slight advantage, unless holding for periods over 10+ years or having unusually high returns. But a .6-.8% expense ratio may very well exceed the benefit either way. Would have to do the math.",

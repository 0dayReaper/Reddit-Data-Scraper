    "postText": "I like many bought the hype and lost a shitload. I am in a position where I can dollar cost average my shares down to the $4 range. \n\nMorningstar provides a lot of long-term hope so I don't want to lock in the loss, which is substantial, but every other ratings bureau says to avoid. \n\nLooking for opinions or insight that's not already known. The US will eventually make cannabis legal (or at least *not illegal*) which opens up the US market to them considerably because it triggers the purchase of some domestic companies. \n\nMy gut right now says to just keep holding out, but my fear is that in that time the growing domestic companies will eat away everything that CGC is set to gain by entering the US.",

The issue has moved beyond cannabis and has again become a political football in the Senate. Despite the fact that there are 10 Republican senators who would support de-scheduling, the atmosphere in D.C. is to do everything to prevent the opposing party from scoring a 'win', and unfortunately the clear preference of the American people is ignored. The fact that Joe is an old drug warrior and will not use the bully pulpit to promote these changes certainly doesn't help either.",

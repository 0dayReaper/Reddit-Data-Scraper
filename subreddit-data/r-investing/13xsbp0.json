    "postText": "With the 3M / 4M (13W / 17W) benchmarks having the highest yields right now, I began to think about Floating Rate Notes.\n\nFRNs are a relatively new US Treasury instrument, starting in the year 2013. FRNs are indexed against the 13W Treasury but plus a \"spread\" that's determined at auction. For example, today's FRNs are +0.169%. So an FRN today would be around 0.169% higher than the 13W Treasury (which is itself, determined on a weekly basis and will float).\n\nIn effect, FRNs are for people who plan to build a 13W bond ladder (plus get a wee bit more interest on top of that), but are otherwise far more convenient than clicking the buy  button all the time. FRNs just make money over the next 2 years when they mature, or can be sold earlier than that.\n\n------------\n\nAnyone have experience with FRNs that they'd like to share? They seem like a good almost-cash like (or perhaps... more BIL-like) instrument. They seem to be liquid, float with the short-term rate (which is substantially good right now), and very low risk.\n\nBut I'd be curious what anyone's practical experience is.",

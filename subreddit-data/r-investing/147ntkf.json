            "comment": "In the short term, the price of an ETF is driven by supply and demand for the ETF, similar to the price of an individual company's stock price. However, there is a mechanism in place that helps keep an ETF's price equal to the NAV of the assets within the ETF. This is done through authorized participants (APs). APs are large banks, brokers, and other market makers that are allowed to either\n\na) Exchange 1 share of the ETF for a corresponding quantity of all of the underlying assets in the fund\n\nor\n\nb) Exchange a corresponding quantity of all of the underlying assets in the fund for 1 share of the ETF\n\nThe APs use these two actions to arbitrage risk free profits, and this arbitrage keeps the ETF price at the NAV of the underlying assets.\n\nHere's how this works in practice. Let's say demand for an ETF has caused the price of the ETF to be higher than the NAV of the underlying assets. An AP now buys all of the underlying assets, executes action b), and then sells the share of the ETF. This is a risk free profit to the AP. The result is that the price of the ETF is pushed down (because the AP has sold it) and the price of the underlying assets goes up (because the AP purchased it). This is repeated millions of times per second until the two prices equalize.\n\nThe same process happens in reverse if the price of the ETF is below that of the underlying assets. The APs buys shares of the fund, executes action a), then sells the underlying assets.",

The amount is probably less than the bid ask spread anyway, of say, $0.01 per share. It\u2019s really not significant enough to worry about, and the liquidity and convenience of ETFs is well worth it anyway. You would need to buy millions of shares before this added up to a significant cost. Since the APs can buy millions of shares, those fractions of a penny per share do add up.",

In general they are huge, like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan , etc.  They are given the ability to engage in arbitrage on ETFs, a process that keeps ETF prices in line with the underlying basket of stocks in a given ETF.  They also make some money in the process, but it keeps ETFs priced properly for everyone.  \n\nTo give you an example of how it works, just imagine that for every share of an ETF, it holds only three stocks:  1 share of ABC at $10, 1 share of DEF at $30, and one share of XYZ at $60.  And at the beginning of a day, the ETF is priced at $100, in line with its holdings. But during the course of the day, each of its three underlying stocks rises by a dollar per share. So now the underlying basket of stocks is worth $103 but the ETF is still priced at $100.  \nIn the last five minutes of the day, the APs will submit Creation (buy) orders big enough to boost the price to $103. They have models that tell them how much they need to create/buy in order to raise the price by the right amount.  \nThe same goes for days in which the ETF becomes overvalued relative to the underlying basket of stocks, but the APs would sell (Redeem) ETF shares to bring its price back in line with the underlying basket of stocks. \nSo the last five or 10 minutes on an ETF trading desk is pretty chaotic, with all the APs, trying desperately to get their orders in and executed before the market closes.\nIf you\u2019re interested, you can read more about the process [here](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/what-is-the-creationredemption-mechanism)",

The answer is, the fund needs a NAV because it's tracking to an index.  \nSo let's look at an example, XBI, which tracks to the S&amp;P Biotechnology Select Industry Index.    \n\n\nDuring the day, supply and demand fluctuations result in a fluctuating real time market price (MP).  But what about the underlying assets?  How do they keep it all in sync? The fund will re-sync to it's index by buying and selling shares in the index and feeding (or removing) them back into the fund as shares.  So in cases of very high demand, the fund may trading with the MP &gt; NAV.  And on the contrary, in the case of very low demand, the fund may trade with MP &lt; NAV.  When the MP is less than the NAV, the ETF is trading at a DISCOUNT.  When MP &gt; NAV, it's trading at a PREMIUM.  These variances between MP and NAV will need to be addressed by the fund in a timely manner.  \n\n\nSo what if the fund doesn't address it?  How do you know how well the fund is doing in resolving MP to NAV differential based on market volatility (supply/demand).  That's Tracking Error.  Here's a graph of the difference in MP and NAV for XBI, and you can see the corrections being made along the time axis, and just how tough it can be for the fund to keep the fund on track in cases of spiking demand or supply.  In fact, you can see a trading arbitrage opportunity on 1/18, which is another story all together.  Hope this helps your understanding.  \n[https://ycharts.com/companies/XBI/discount\\_or\\_premium\\_to\\_nav](https://ycharts.com/companies/XBI/discount_or_premium_to_nav)",

In practice, for the average retail investor, I don't recommend the strategy.  These trades are very short lived, and really involve timing based on short term market exuberance and/or stress.  You need to know why the variance exists, and if that variance is warranted.  It's certainly possible to do these trades, but as is usually the case, it's not as easy or simple as it seems.  Here's more info on the subject that I think may be helpful:  \nhttps://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/literature/investor-education/understanding-closed-end-fund-premiums-and-discounts.pdf",

The mutual companies have relationships with large banks called APs who in turn have relationships with market makers to make sure the ETF stays near NAV almost all the time.  That relationship can fall apart during times of high market stress but in general it won't.",

For the average retail investor, you should IMO consider the average of the absolute value of the premium/discount a one time cost of ownership (basically look at the premium/discount chart and assume that you're going to pay a premium of roughly half the max premium).\n\nFor large funds like SPY or VOO, the premium/discount is going to average around .05%\n\nWhich is basically well within the realm of daily trading noise.\n\nThis topic really isn't worth wrapping your mind around unless you're doing very rapid trades (like an algo trader), investing in very small ETFs, or investing in closed funds (which would be an entirely different conversation).",

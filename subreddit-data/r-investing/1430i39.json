    "postText": "My wife and I recently welcomed our first child and I\u2019m putting together my game plan for her finances. Obviously opening a 529 investment account is the common doctrine, but the chatter around higher education over the past few years has me now rethinking things.\n\nI was fortunate enough to have my undergrad paid for via a standard brokerage account, and a part of me is leaning towards doing the same for my daughter due to the flexibility. Using a normal brokerage acct would give up some tax advantages, but I am wondering if that would be worth it to not be locked into using it for higher education without a penalty. \n\nMy speculations are that the anger of education costs, the reality of AI, more jobs hiring based on actual aptitude, not education level, and the general negative view towards traditional college will come to a point where college in 18 years will be nothing like we have today. I realize that a 10% penalty on gains isn\u2019t the end of the world, but paying the govt a penalty on top of taxes makes me cringe.\n\nWould you still open a 529 for a newborn, or consider a traditional brokerage acct or some other vehicle for giving your child some type of financial nest egg in 18 years?",

To this day 93%+ of new hires across those companies have 4-year degrees. The 7% that don\u2019t are almost exclusively either content/data entry roles, executive assistants or SDRs - pretty standard no degree required roles.\n\nMy own job technically doesn\u2019t have a degree requirement and theoretically doesn\u2019t require any non-trainable skills. Yet 50%+ of us have multiple degrees and almost everyone on the team has at least one degree from a top-50 university",

I find this incredibly important and believe it\u2019s where humans will differentiate from machines in a more automated world.

I know that more than likely won't completely cover college for my kids but it'll be a good start and we're saving a ton in other buckets too(401k, Roth, brokerage acct).

Since the discount isn't a large amount, you could probably argue in court that you should just be required to pay the difference in premiums. \n\nI'd just buy the share, though. Berkshire Hathaway is a quality investment and historically has always been one of my best performers. If index funds didn't exist, I'd invest the majority of my funds in BRK.B.",

I used to own BRKB, but I sold it (thankfully right before it tanked).\n\nFord Motor Company (F) will supposedly sell you cars for I think $500 over invoice if you own 100 shares. Given the cost of some of their trucks, you could probably buy 100 shares, buy a truck, and still come out ahead.",

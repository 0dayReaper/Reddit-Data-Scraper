    "postText": "I want to make sure that the recommendations I gave to my friend are correct. Here is the background:\n\nMy friend just started a job with a new company, and I wanted to make sure he is properly preparing himself for retirement. He is in his late 20\u2019s and is now able to really start building his portfolio. His time horizon is roughly 30-35 years, and his effective income tax rate is estimated to be roughly 20% this year (state and federal). During our conversation, I found out that the 401K provider has a financial advisor that they provide as a resource to employee participants of the plan. After asking some probing questions over the course of a 15-minute discussion, I feel like that advice that this so called \u201cprofessional\u201d gave my friend was not only misguided, it was flat out wrong. The first issue I took was with the investment advise he gave. This advice was not to invest most of the money in stocks right now since we \u201cdon\u2019t know what the market is going to do this year\u201d and to hold the money in less volatile investments like government bonds and stable value funds to wait out the uncertainty of the year. I fundamentally disagree with this advice as I subscribe to the belief that you should always be buying regardless of what the market is doing (especially in an automated account like a 401K) and that trying to time the market is a fool\u2019s errand. Am I the crazy one here? The second issue I took was with the type of account the advisor recommended. He told my friend that he should NOT be contributing to a Roth 401K and instead should opt for the traditional pre-tax option. This is the second point that I disagree with. My friend is just starting his career and expects his income to scale up quickly over the coming years. I personally believe that because of his age, time horizon, and relatively low effective income tax rate he should be contributing to a Roth 401K until his effective income tax rate breaks 25%. Again, am I missing something here? And if I\u2019m correct, how did this \u201cexpert\u201d give such bad advice?",

At 20% tax bracket I would generally agree with you, but there are also [perfectly valid arguments](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/10qwnrx/why_you_should_almost_never_contribute_to_a_roth/) that a Traditional 401(k) is better for the majority of people. This isn't as clear-cut bad advice as the previous topic.",

As your income scales up so will your tax bracket. When you retire, you only have to draw off what you need so hypothetically would be in a lower tax bracket. So why pay 25% in taxes today instead of 10% in taxes at retirement?",

The advisor may have picked up on a hesitancy for risk and might have wanted to just get him started for matching/experience. \n\nAs far as a reason for traditional vs Roth, is your friend cash poor?   Possibly the advisor recommended traditional because your friend had less than the company match available.  With traditional, the number available is roughly 20% higher than Roth due to tax savings. \n\nThat was me playing devils advocate because I told my children that Roth is best if you can afford it and to create an emergency fund then push long term/retirement savings into low cost wide market index funds because most blips now will average out well with dca and time in the market.",

Typically better to do that when it makes a bigger difference \n\nSince 401k is a periodic investment and by the time he has a few contributions under his belt we will probably be in a recession, the advice to go into a Money Market yielding 5% interest is good for that short interval.\n\nBut he should rebalance into a full S&amp;P 500 fund and change all future elections to be 100% in that as well\n\nThis is, as you say, market timing and can be dangerous.\n\nMy easy button advice is go 100% into a low expense S&amp;P 500 fund (like Vanguard VFIAX )",

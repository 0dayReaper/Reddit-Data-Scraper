I've read a bunch of white papers and every one concludes that equal weighting theoretically will outperform cap weighted over the long run. It makes sense considering the following facts: 1) only 40% of stocks will make money, and the rest are losers, and 2) over the long run, 100% of gains comes from 4% of stocks. \n\nIt's really hard to pick stocks, so you need to just hold all of them. The most a stock can lose is 100%, but your winners are unbounded. If you hold an equal weighting of 10 stocks, and 9 of them lose money, if your tenth goes up 10x, you're fine. Same cannot be said if you're cap weighted - it would depend on which one it was. Theoretically, it's harder for massive companies to grow 10x compared to smaller companies, but the last 10 years would beg to differ.\n\nEdit: Added link: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fear-the-faang-stocks-heres-a-better-sp-500-index-fund-for-you-2018-07-26",

As growth stock have huge increase in multiples (high PE etc) they will become underweighted relative their market weight.\n\nAlso the aim is to diversify and \"own a bit of everything\". Since no one can predict the future, your best bet is to own a bit of every company, to take part in their rise. The key here is take part in the rise, not buy in after the rise.\n\nIf you solely buy into market cap weight, you are mostly buying into businesses who have already have a big rise. Which may sound good, buy good companies right? But there is no guarantee that it will continue into the future. And seeing huge increases, means that even more huge increases get less and less likely.\n\nThis is where many make the mistake in investing. They buy the hot stock that has already ballooned. You always have to ask yourself, \"what is going to happen with this stock tomorrow?\". Not \"what happened to it yesterday?\".\n\nWhile momentum investing has some merit, it's a dangerous game, and you gotta be quick both in and out. Which means timing. And the market will out-time you 99 out of 100 times.\n\nAnd then you have AAPL, a trillion dollar company that grows like it's a million dollar company, so what do I know.",

Apple's volumes are so insane, very very few companies have the volume apple has in this world, so they get great pricing for components. No vendor in the world will reject apple as a customer, everyone will do whatever it takes to retain apple as a customer and gives them the highest attention (see: TSMC)\n\nTSMC is completely maxed out on capacity. If Apple didn't take up that capacity, there are plenty of other companies that would (AMD, Nvidia, etc.) Given the semiconductor shortage going on right now, Apple is likely paying a premium for TSMC's fabs. The price difference is likely the reason why Nvidia went with Samsung fabs for their new cards as opposed to TSMC. While doing so leaves probably leaves some performance on the table, they're so ahead of the competition they don't have to worry about it.",

Now you don't anymore since they used it up. Mathematically it does nothing *directly* to the stock price. But it (usually) signals to investors that a company has some confidence in itself and that the future looks good. They wouldn't be buying their own shares if they think dark times are ahead (unless management is just pumping up their own compensation).",

Additionally, I\u2019d say that in general (and Tim Cook has said this specifically) companies won\u2019t buy back shares if they don\u2019t believe their stock is overvalued or even adequately valued. It only makes sense to buy shares if you 1. Have additional liquidity that you don\u2019t need for reinvestment, and 2. Think your stock is undervalued. If you felt like your stock was adequately valued then you would just keep the cash.",

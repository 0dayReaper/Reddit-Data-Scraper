I\u2019m down 40% and no longer believes in Cathy Woods, and want to take a more passive approach into investing instead. However selling and going into VEQT while down 40% feels very painful. I don\u2019t need the money for a long time. Any advice for me?",

It just happens to be in ARK, it is one trade away from being cash.\n\nTo keep holding ARK you need to have confidence it's coming back AND that it will beat VOO, which is where your money could be hanging out.\n\nWhat you have right now is the sunk cost fallacy.",

Every day.\n\nIf the answer switches from \"yes\" to \"no\" back and forth at too high a frequency, then your evaluation engine is miscalibrated (your \"optimal\" decion making has too much of a trading tax) and you'd be better off in a broader ETF. This second part is underappreciated. It is brutally hard to develop this valuation engine to perform optimally through the highs and lows of a business cycle (we only get to see a few during our working lives).",

If you wish to be overexposed to a specific sector, buy the index for that sector like QQQ. \n\nCan a great team of active investors sometimes outperform the index? Yes, but it does not appear they can usually do it consistently over a long time. \n\nMore importantly, please look at ARKK and ARKQ's fund holdings. Do you truly believe in these companies? If you have to buy stocks, would you pick them?\n\nI used to hold some ARKK during the pandemic boom years and luckily sold when the fund first started to fall in value. What got me to sold was that I did not believe in many of the holdings. An example like Roku: Terrible company that will probably someday go bankrupt as the world shifts to Google/Samsung/Apple with their own TV operating system. \n\nIf you want to yolo some money on the side, take 90% of your money and buy an index fund. Take 10% and pick whatever fun stuff you want to do. Trim this and do not over-expose yourself for risk that you cannot tolerate. \n\nYou will read every day on Wallstreetbets of someone who yoloed a bunch of money and got rich quick. You will also read stories of heartache and loss on that same forum. I choose slow, steady, and high probability of success.",

Every day you decide to hold is equivalent to buying the whole stack again every day. Apart from transaction costs of course. So the most logical thing to do would be to just pull the bandage off in one go and sell your ARKQ holdings.\n\nIf you cannot stand the thought of ARKQ spiking after you sell, you could always do a reverse DCA. Just sell equal portions of ARKQ over a set period. This would lessen the hurt somewhat if ARKQ starts climbing. Mind you, in this scenario you will still be exposed to further (but less) hurt if ARKQ takes a nosedive.",

Since inception ARKQ has returned 12%, unfortunately you didn't buy then lol. It's just been a bumpy ride getting that 12%. I am not on the hate Cathie Wood train, its important to understand who she is and who she isn't. TLDR she is the daughter of an engineer and has a very good grasp of new technology, has managed funds in the past and produced returns for her clients. People labeling her a Charlatan are following price movements. She will not closet index, and doesn't manage stock volatility at all. She has shown in previous funds before ARK she just doesn't care and can stomach more risk than clients can. Just know that if you invest with her. \n\nI would not sell ARKQ, when risk appetite comes back so will her holdings. The higher beta of her holdings work both ways. I'd suggest adding new money to your account and buy SPY/VOO. If you're going to index, just buy the S&amp;P500. I don't think index ETF's can outperform SPY/VOO because as soon as a factor outperforms everyone piles into it. Just buy the market to dampen your portfolio volatility",

Never blindly follow the herds on Reddit.\n\nAnother example I can offer you is the obvious shill of VTI/VTSAX or any Vanguard investments on Reddit. Currently Vanguard does not have the cheapest ER, Fidelity does. \n\nAnd VTI/VTSAX is cap weighted so it is highly concentrated in mega-cap tech while if you look at the holdings &gt; 2000 small and mid cap stocks are included just to give clueless morons a sense of \u201cdiversification\u201d but in reality the top 100 holdings literally control movements of the entire index. \n\nSo a lesson for you and many others here, many people of Reddit are just morons, gamblers and idiots who can only repeat the talking points they hear from elsewhere. Not many can open a fund provider websites, look at the holdings, weighting, etc\u2026 and understand what they all mean.",

Know the history of Fidelity, they have historically (and still do) offer funds with very high expense ratios. \n\n2) Your point about cap weighting is meaningless. The objective of owning TSM is to hold the entire market at cap weight, which is what VTI does. By virtue of being cap weighted, the megacaps are always going to be the largest concentration.",

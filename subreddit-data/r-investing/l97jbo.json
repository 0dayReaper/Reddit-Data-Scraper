    "postText": "*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.* \n\nRather than doing a writeup of Friday, I think the time I have at the moment would be better spent going over some conceptual market mechanics.  As I mentioned in my previous post that covered some light analysis of the week, my first glance was that Friday was a low conviction, low volume day where momentum traders/and volatility arbitraging HFT algos were skirmishing, and a slightly deeper look tells me that's probably the case for almost the entire day, up to the last minutes before close.\n\nThere was a bit of a push toward the end of the day just to extract maximum interest charge pain.  Keep in mind also that on Friday many of the retail brokerages still had issues with GME, and GME price was also protected from aggressive short-side attack due to the uptick rule.\n\n# Capital Flow, Liquid Float, and Price\n\nOk, so let's go with a diagram I put together while thinking about how to best answer a ton of questions related to the mechanics behind triggering a squeeze.  This is not very formal--just conceptual to help you think about the relationship between price, liquid free float, and capital required to move things around.\n\n[Capital Flow to Price Volatility Leverage Conceptual Diagram](https://u.teknik.io/DDa8Y.PNG)\n\nAs you can see in the diagram, I figured it would be conceptually clearest to model the relationship kind of like a seesaw.\n\nOn the left you can see that people selling tends to increase liquid float, moving the fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to the right, except in the case of selling to people who are planning to buy and hold, which moves the fulcrum to the left.\n\nThe lower the liquid free float, or the further to the left the fulcrum goes, the greater the likely impact of any particular capital flow (net selling or buying) on share price.  Importantly, as the diagrams on the right half show, it's not a linear relationship.  The closer the liquid free float comes to 0%, the faster the price volatility increases... theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches 0%.\n\nI find it sometimes help to think of the extreme case to help clarify.  On the extremely liquid side, if you have all of the tens of millions of GME shares in play, dropping $10,000 in to buy shares probably doesn't even register on the ticker.  On the other extreme, if what if there was only 1 share in play?  That same $10,000 instantly prices GME at $10,000 a share--if you can even get the person holding it to sell!\n\nSince company value is estimated mark-to-market, GME would instantly become rated one of the most  (if not the most) valuable companies in the world.  This is in no way true, of course, as you could not subsequently sell all the rest of the shares at that price, but as far as a whole bunch of market mechanics and market participants are concerned, they would have to treat it that way until another transaction took place to re-price the company.\n\nSo, in the grand scheme of things, in terms of difficulty of initiating what magnitude of a squeeze, the primary factor is locking up actively traded/liquid free float.  Also important to keep in mind, locking up the float is only very gradually noticeable until you get very close to locking it all down, and you reach a point where suddenly each fraction of free float being locked up has parabolically greater impact on price volatility, reaching its limit where going from 2 actively traded shares to 1 actively traded share doubles price volatility sensitivity to capital flow by just locking up a single additional share.\n\nSo simple, right?  Actually, yes. However, don't mistake simple for easy (absolutely not the same thing in this case).\n\n# Market Games\n\nSo, GME and other high short interest stocks are looked at in two ways by many market participants.  On the one hand, you have normal investors and traders who don't really pay attention to it at all, and, if they do, they see it as a tool for price discovery that is otherwise neutral and dampens volatility (people tend to short stocks as price goes up, and cover shorts as price drops, so normal shorting activity is at least in theory supposed to help keep price stable).\n\nThen you have what I'll call market gamers.  These are people who are willing to look through the veil of what various mechanics in the market are theoretically intended to accomplish, and just pay attention to what they actually do.  There are a number of market mechanics that get really strange in extreme circumstance, and shorting is one of them, as using it to the extreme can absolutely crush a company's share price and actually harm the company badly.  The counter to that is the increasing risk of a squeeze, which gets worse with extreme price volatility.\n\nImagine it this way.  Short interest in a stock is like the stock comes with a very strange feature--a closed wormhole portal into the brokerage account of the short position holder that, if slammed with a high enough day or week end price, blows open and sucks their account capital through, and possibly their broker's capital too, until they've patched it closed again with shares of stock they were short.\n\nThat's not how you're supposed to look at it, but that's kind of how it actually works in practice.  Most wall street types would find it appalling and wrong to think about it that way, but with Millenials and younger jumping in to the market we're talking about generations of people who grew up watching things like people doing [4 minute speed runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSYY4k52GEs) through games intended to take[\\~100 hrs](https://howlongtobeat.com/game?id=21614) to complete, using nothing but the mechanics of the game in ways entirely unintended by the developers.  That's kind of what GME is like, from a certain point of view--a speed run through the market, blitzing and confusing everyone watching--throwing a ton of money at hedge funds' short interest until you blow a hole in their account and suck the capital out with the force of a black hole.  Of course people are getting jumpy.\n\n# Battleground - Strategy and Tactics\n\nIn a way, GME has turned into a battleground stock in the minds of many wall street people.  Wall Street vs WSB is basically the way it's been depicted in the media, and a number of them seem to be taking it personally.\n\nWith a battleground stock I find it helpful to think of it like a literal battleground, but with territory marked out by stock price.  It helps you consider the impact on each 'side', what their motives are, and tactical and strategic implications.  The reason I think this way is that once a stock becomes a battleground, the issue is no longer about price discovery--it's about proving a point or accomplishing a specific goal, which changes the dynamics of the trade.\n\nIn my opinion, the retail strength/defensive line is at the $148 level as mentioned in my previous post analyzing the week.  This is based on the majority of volume being in the runup from $30 to $148, which triggered the first squeeze.\n\nMy guess is short-side strength hardens at the $350 level, based on that being the level at which the whale plugged the first squeeze.  What this means is that you can expect some short-side people to actively short more at that level, possibly following through on momentum, as many of them want to prove a point that GME is a &lt;$20 stock, as stated by a number of them on CNBC.  $350 might seem like a low number given Friday's close, but remember that Friday trading was subject to the uptick rule, so the short effectively could not push back, and was instead fighting a rearguard action to bleed the long-side advance as much as possible, and lure them off their strength as much as possible.\n\nSay what?  Is there a point to those analogies like that?  Why yes, of course, because those analogies are very good mental models for what is going to happen in a short squeeze campaign.\n\nRemember, in the grand scheme of things, the goal of the long side is first and foremost to lock up liquid float.  That means buying and holding shares.  The question is.. how much will it cost you to move the needle on that, so to speak.  the higher the price the short side can force you to pay to lock up float, the longer it'll take and the more expensive it will be.  It is also like fighting far from your supply lines in that respect, in that there will be weaker hands mixed in far beyond hard support levels, such that quick pushes by the short side will shake them out, loosening float back up.\n\nHow about on the long side?  You want the short side to overextend themselves by shorting the price down on momentum, and hopefully get them to keep building up short interest at the lowest price at which they will do so.  This means having to have the patience to see the price go as low as you can tolerate before you start losing your key support to despair.  Why?  Because it means you're buying the shares they throw at you at a lower price (costs less to move the needle on locking up liquid free float) and also that their short position is at a lower average price, lowering the price it will take to trigger a squeeze.\n\nThe above is why, in some cases, you will see a sharp dip before the vertical move in a squeeze.  You can essentially lure the short side into an ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points, which allows you to continue to lock up free float at ever cheaper prices while the short side thinks it is winning.  Once you think you've accumulated enough to prevent covering without a parabolic price move, you spike the price back the other way and it's effectively game over.  It can take some time to play out to its conclusion, but that is the essence of it.\n\nLet's make it concrete and put some numbers to it.  let's say you need to lock up 10mio more shares for the squeeze (no idea, just using the number for easy math).  If you can buy it all skirmishing at the $200 line, you'll pay $2bn to do it.  If instead you've extended to the $300 line, you're going to pay $3bn.  If you're an alpha-seeking whale, why pay 50% more to accomplish the same thing if you can get away with it?  If you recall, I referenced seeing what I thought looked like this type of ticker behavior in my 3rd post.\n\nThat being said, you might not mess around with those types of tactics at this point if you think you're already close to blowing up the next short interest holder.\n\nIf you think you're close, then you're looking at the most efficient way to make the last tick at trading close as high as possible.\n\nThat is very similar to the price action we saw on Friday at the end of the day, as mentioned earlier.  If you think about it, if the goal is the have the price at/above a certain point at the end of the day, what is more efficient?  Rush in the morning, then have to pay that higher price level for the whole day to maintain it, or wait until later in the day, as late as you think you can manage, and then push to that point at the very last tick?\n\nThat, at least, is a very high level view of what you're trying to accomplish, but it gets very complicated in the details.  If you're dueling with a good HFT algorithm, you can run into things like the price getting spiked to trigger halts to run out the clock (kind of like fouling someone in basketball), which gets harder in the final minutes of trading due to the wider LU/LD allowances, but still doable, even if you have to do it by sucking price level up (maybe to give you 5 mins to call your buddy at Blackrock to dump shares onto the ticker or something like that).\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind.  One of the reasons these things can roll on for a long time, is it might not be a one and done blowout (possibly on purpose).  Think about it--if you can get people to keep piling short interest in--particularly for emotional reasons, you can ring the register as many times as they are willing to keep doing it to ultimately prove their point.  Think of the Citron guy who re-shorted back in around what.. $90 or $100 I think?  All because he wanted to make his point when he got blown out at the move off of $30.  There are people piling back in right now.  Who knows how many times they're willing to reload the short float.\n\nOk, so this post is much longer than I originally intended anyway, but I think the diagram and some of the descriptions above should provide a good amount of food for thought and discussion.  A number of people asked me why I said that price to squeeze was secondary at this point.  If you haven't already figured out why, try to think about it, or maybe ask in comments and someone can help with a further discussion.\n\nA couple of final points:\n\n* Assuming the long-side people continue to lock up liquid float, remember that volatility can get greater in BOTH directions.  This can mean that you get wiped out if you're somehow still trading GME on margin, as a quick price collapse can get you margin called even if the price quickly rebounds later.\n* Greater volatility means you should mentally prepare for big dips as well as swings to the upside.  Pre-market and after hours trading don't have circuit breakers, so it could get wild during those times too.\n* Also with extreme volatility you end up possibly hitting halts more frequently.  After the first frustrating day of this happening with GME I made myself a basic thinkorswim thinkscript study so I'd have a handy reference on whether it looked like this was going to happen.  For those of you on ToS, use it on the 1 minute chart.  Note that the LULD tolerances are different in first few minutes and toward the end of the day, so you'd have to adjust the parameters (or just keep it in mind).  I use it with the step lines vs the default line.  If price crosses the guard lines then you're getting close--if it crosses the circuit breaker line then you're about to be or already are getting halted.  Here is the code:\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    input TrailingPeriodLength = 5;\n    input CircuitBreakerPercent = 10.0;\n    input GuardMultiplePercent = 70.0;\n    \n    def trlAvg = Average(close, TrailingPeriodLength);\n    \n    plot trailingAverage = trlAvg;\n    \n    plot upperStop = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);\n    plot lowerStop = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);\n    \n    plot upperRail = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);\n    plot lowerRail = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);\n\nAlso, I got a comment in another post telling me to get a job lol.  Actually I have one, so I'm not sure how much I'll be able to post from Monday forward.  As I've mentioned in a few comments on prior posts, I actually am not active on social media normally.  I just created this account to try to help people use this probably once-in-a-lifetime event and the intense interest it's generating to help people learn to become better investors and traders.  I'll try to keep posting, but maybe not as regularly, and probably shorter (which I know some of you will be happy about :)).\n\nHope you all have a good rest of the weekend.  Good luck in the Market on Monday",

The two main things influencing that are: A) the size of the short position relative to the total account margin allowance, and B) the average share price of the short interest.\n\nBased on the above, a few bullet points:\n\n* Larger position size relative to the rest of the portfolio means the price doesn't have to go too far above their average price to trigger a squeeze\n\n* Lower average price means the price to squeeze will be lower\n\n* You can also try to attack the value of the rest of the account to instead lower their margin allowance if you cannot push the GME interest up (typically much harder, but there are exceptions).  This is also more feasible if it is a highly leveraged account.\n\nGME has been an automatic two-way attack by both raising the price and resulting in deleveraging of the overall market, so the hedge funds are losing in both directions (GME going up, rest of portfolio going down)",

The brokers have no way to hedge the risk they'd be taking on to do that favor, so they won't.  Basically, the hedge funds have nothing to offer them, and they're not a charity.  The hedge funds would have to instead cut deals with the large institutional holders of GME.\n\nNormally you would say there was little chance of this, but if they wanted to go all-or-nothing into the trade, they would first lever into particularly sensitive parts of the large holders' portfolio, and then go negotiate.  The argument they would be able to make then is that allowing them to be blown up will cost the GME holder far more than bailing the hedge fund out.  This threat might have more credibility now than it did a week ago given that the entire market had to deleverage to an extent because of the GME situation--and it didn't even go full MOASS yet.\n\nThat being said, while the details about the concern you raised in your post may not match the situation, the overall insight that rules get bent when big money is on the line is absolutely true.  That is why I usually refrain from guessing what will happen.",

It might take years to accomplish, but Wall Street will give the share price the benefit of the doubt, so to speak, instantly if they believe that kind of turnaround is likely to happen, particularly in this monetary policy environment. Companies with way worse financials than GME are getting valuations way higher than that because they can get Wall Street to believe that someday somehow they\u2019ll make insane money.

I put my diagrams on an anonymizing file service because I want to avoid anyone ever knowing who I actually am to avoid that kind of BS.\n\nThe other post was not negative, or at least that was not my intention.  It was just not hype.  With that post and this post I was trying to show people some of the tools you can use to try to understand what is going on in the market.  You can get a good feel from the ticker action, and trade with better conviction and likely more consistent results if you do this.\n\nMy series of posts are intended to just walk people through how I look at things, and then also the importance of going back and verifying.  I know that no matter how certain I am of something happening in realtime, you never have the ability to actually check things carefully in realtime.  That is what I meant about occasionally going back and checking to see if you were correct.  In my opinion, I think it's better for me to show people the tools I sometimes use, ways I might use them, etc. and let them come to their own conclusions vs. trying to tell them what to do/think.  If I want to get psyched I'll go to WSB (seriously, some of those memes are awesome), so I figure I don't need to do any hyping here.  Realtime sentiment-driven momentum trading, on the other hand, means trying to be extremely sensitive to those things, which means trading that way with that kind of mindset, at least for me (hence the very different tone of those posts).\n\nTo me, it is important to try to understand players in the market, their sentiment, motives, morale, etc., so you can try to react appropriately, especially in a massively volatile momentum trade like GME.  On the other hand, when you have time, you want to step back and take a hard look at the data.  Over time you will find mistakes in your realtime reasoning, which will then help you learn to make more accurate calls in realtime going forward.\n\nIn that earlier post I referenced losing out on maybe $300k in momentum trading opportunity because I hadn't done a good analysis earlier.  Had I done one, I would have:\n* Realized by the first after-hours tick of that first squeeze that in fact a squeeze was in progress, because I would have understood that that type of volume just does not happen normally after hours, even during the hype runup.  That would have put in context the $500 high as a squeeze high, not new retail support (i.e. sell there, buy the dip).\n* Understood that the hard support to repel that insane short-side attack on Thursday would actually be in the 130s - 150s range (the momentum behind that move would definitely pierce what I labeled the line of defense in my last post, but then likely bounced back).  Just looking at the chart in realtime I figured that the support floor for the day was going to be around the market open bounce near 250s, so I bought into that dip way too early.  The 250s level was also on much lower volume to be a strong support.  Still profitable with the later mean reversion, but literally about 1/2 as profitable as it would have been had I been better prepared.\n\n*side note: for those who may be upset reading the above, I have a core holding of GME I'm just holding on to, and a portion of momentum trading capital for any opportunities*",

I've followed trading with level 2 data throughout the week and I saw how Thursday unfolded.\n\nMy take on the issue is, combined with the short ladder attack, that many retail investors, especially the ones using mobile apps like Robinhood and who just aren't sophisticated, went haywire as they couldn't buy more shares (among them GME). Of course that didn't affect everyone, inc. myself, but many either got scared by that or the cratering stock price. (Does Robinhood even require multiple clicks for orders?) Also the liquidation of assets with margin calls was a catalyst. Plus I'm not sure why Robinhood fractionals were being dumped. Panic selling?\n\nAlso broadly the sentiment got momentarily cautious, since it wasn't clear what's going on. I personally had a gut feeling somebody is seriously trying to jinx the retail investors and cause havoc. I personally decided to just watch how it unfolds.\n\nIf anything, there was a serious colluded attack on retail investors, which does warrant an investigation. I don't mean how they blocked purchases due to liquidity and clearing issues, since that's understandable. I mean that the timing of all the events and how also Reddit was being attacked. And the temporary shutdown of Discord was also dubious.\n\nIf anything, the retail side of the GME story held and in the end things rebounded, as the demand was still there.",

If you had started with, say, a 50/50 core holding and momentum trading allocation, by now you could have more than covered your initial capital outlay in profit taking, and 10x'd your position in both core GME holding and momentum trading capital.  These are normally ridiculous crazy talk-type numbers btw, but this is also probably a once-in-a-lifetime type momentum trading opportunity.  People who got in early and understood the opportunity have 100x'd with options before the option greeks blew up and they became so expensive.\n\nThat kind of strategy actually allows you to contribute more if your purpose is to trigger the squeeze vs if you just bought and held from day 1.\n\nRegarding WSB, they are a mixed bag of people who really know what they're doing, and people who follow what those people tell them.  Whether that's wise just depends on whether you trust those peoples' A) judgement/skill, and B) intent.  I tend to believe that at least the OG GME people are both good and sincere, since they were sharing the opportunities and their reasoning transparently before anyone knew what would happen.  The only caution I have is that absolutely no one can tell you with certainty what is going to happen next.  Just remember that when you're riding the rocket... you're riding a F'in rocket... rocket rides are not smooth, but they can be awesome.\n\nRegarding the pyramid scheme vibe.. I'm not sure one way or the other.  At the moment I tend to see more people who have latched on to the cause with such fervor and conviction (for various reasons), that they get mad if they feel like you're even hinting at any deviation from the gospel.  It is also true that at least to this point, if you lacked faith/conviction in this trade, you were almost certain to get washed out for big losses on the massive volatility.  That might be why some of them get so sensitive--they saw friends who got wiped out because at the critical moment they doubted and despaired out into the bottom of a hard dip.",

I can't say, maybe the retail wsb horde already fired off what they had.  But I think it is very likely to translate into dollars, and we won't see the peak for at least a few days.

I've already started reading more about the many models and KPI's you've been mentioning throughout your posts. These have been inspiring me to learn more about investing (not just gambling).\n\nNow to the question: I get the sense that you are mainly focused on providing hard facts and not advice, but FOMO is getting the better of me. Would you say that it's too late to get in on the action come next week? I would only put enough in to purchase a share or two at the current price - money that I am willing to lose (fully aware that it won't make me rich and it won't make me poor). If so, at what point would you recommend buying in (if it dips)? Is there usually a point during trading hours that this typically happens (early/mid/late in the day)?\n\nI've also been seeing that $AMC is also part of this movement - what are your thoughts on that side of this?\n\nAgain, THANK YOU. These have been absolutely wonderful. I've been keeping up with WSB throughout this, so you're explanation is a breathe of fresh air.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am aware you are not a financial advisor and will not hold you accountable - it's my money and my risk.*",

How can we trust the short interest numbers, it seems that different sources are reporting different numbers. On some sites the Days to Cover is around 2 days, whereas on other sites it is &gt;5 days?\n\n2. How do we know in the first place that Melvin or one of the big whales are responsible for the high short interest? Could it be possible that the short interest is distributed among multiple HFs and therefore Melvin might've already covered their share of shorts?\n\n3. Couldn't the HFs slowly close their shorts one at a time, making it seem like that there really isn't any squeeze?\n\n4. Whose shares did these HFs short? Can they not negotiate with the people whose shares they shorted, and ask them to wait it out?",

I only use those numbers as order of magnitude estimates myself.  Just remember, the VW squeeze was on 13% short interest or something like that.\n\nThe intense focus on the exact SI number is partly why I focused on the mechanics in this post.  What that should help you understand is that as long as you get enough float locked up, whether SI is 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, or 120 is immaterial in terms of whether there will be a squeeze--there will be one.\n\nAs far as days to close, you have to look at the source's definition.  Ortex uses currently estimated SI / 30 day average daily volume.  I.e. their DTC calculation is garbage if the volume has been unusual/unusually volatile (which is the case with GME).  It's not that it's not normally a useful datapoint--it's just that this situation is so unusual that it's no longer meaningful.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the DTC figure is based on an assumption that essentially 100% of all buying on those days is done to close short positions.\n\nRegarding 1 and 2, it is possible but would have a dramatic effect on the price.  If you think about it, so far GME has been largely momentum to the upside with occasionally strong short attacks down.  If shorts also added some covering into it, it would undermine their attacks and raise the price more dramatically.\n\nRegarding 3, it's not the person who loaned the shares they're worried about, it's their broker.  You see, the broker is on the hook in case the short seller goes under, so they're not going to take the chance.  Even if you could get the original lenders to agree, what if GME is 3x price by then, and that means the account doesn't have enough to cover?  No, once the account doesn't meet collateral/margin requirements the broker liquidates it and just buys back the shares needed to cover ASAP, possibly leaving the account holder in debt to the broker on the way.",

Given the opportunity at hand, why hasnt there been whales on the long side to lock in the float already. Given the magnitude of SI it would have been pretty easy for a couple of whales to already lock sufficiently, in order to trigger the squeeze from the get go. We are talking about pretty low capital requirements in the case of GME. I saw you answer a similar question, that it is indeed something to think about, but what is your personal take. Could it be that, given the SI and the constant influx of new SI at higher prices it is more profitable to execute X small squeezes, reenter at lows and eventually get that homerun. I know it is oversimplifying the sheer number of players involved but still I find that very interesting. Thank you in advance if you decide to reply. I absolutely love your every take on what is happening.",

The OP has made comments about this consistently. Long HFs are in this too and are very incentivized to continue to lock up the free float.

Super insightful and helps to make better informed decisions.\n\nI don't know if you would like to comment, but I am curious about the role of the retail investor in all this. I know that this may be a battle of sharks, but how big of a role do individuals have in moving the needle? This may also include externalities that are effected by the public like the budding movement that's been all over the forums and news. Do you think something like public sentiment and things unrelated to the technical aspects of the stock will have an effect on how this all plays out?",

Over at WSB it was correctly posted as a graph from Webull, but not with a lot of explanation.\n\nEssentially it's now down to who blinks first.\n\nBefore I proceed, let's get two things straight. I'm not your advisor, just a random stranger in cyberspace. I don't try to push you to win the short squeeze game. I understand fully your emotional state - I too would at least like to get away safe.\n\nSo what would it take?\n\nAt the volume of this Monday, GME is basically acting like a small cap share. There's little supply and demand is not high all the time - at least not now. So the key here is, like OP has explained in other terms, to get some price volatility. Sure, it could still trigger again some gamma squeeze, but most importantly for your stance, there has to be a shortage of supply (i.e. lack of seller, AKA hands of that certain expensive material).\n\nCurrently you can mainly wait and see. I wouldn't really start dumping anything yet. The current level is comparable to last Thu. I'm sure it's nerve wracking, but short interest suggests it's still heavily shorted and there's really a lack of shares to buy.\n\nI don't have access to the NYSE orderbook, but it's possible that some interesting ask prices have again been visible there, due to the lack of sellers.\n\nSo despite the latest from S3 Partners and how this can be perceived through financial media, I personally have chosen to wait this out one trading session at a time. It's possible that volatility swings again in the other direction, since volume is so low.",

I have always been a supporter of the underdog in most situations (I am the underdog in this particular mess).  \n\nBIG SHIFT;\nSince last Friday afternoon I\u2019ve been noticing a dramatic shift from the original WSB feel, mood and expression.  The daily boards are gone, binary memes of the movement; heroes and villains are now the main attraction and the sole of what WSB represented is no where to be found.  \n\nCrude &amp; Vile is part of the sub and I loved it. But at the end we do watch for for each other, changed our views and most learned a thing or two however it was never a space where politics was a topic or driver of it\u2019s momentum. \n\nHowever seems the events which took place last Thursday triggered an opportunity for political agendas to run ramped and morph a unlikely investment victory for the underdog into a totally different game, narrative,  sub reddit etc etc. \n\nIt now feels very political, only leaving room for the anti and pro Wall Street.  That is not what I signed up for.  We have undergone some much division and now this movement is being highjacked by think tanks and interest groups which see an opportunity to weaponize what is taking place to further divide us.  \n\nDoes anyone here also agrees or also sees these changes I\u2019d really like to hear and understand your point of view.

Try to avoid letting WSB affect too much your mind now. I've personally been further empowered to watch out this by reading this sub and r/stocks. Plus there's still good commentary on WSB. It just requires digging and having a good internal filter. My take on the GME short squeeze hasn't changed.\n\nI personally have posted on WSB that not all shorting is an issue. The issue is when it's going bonkers, like with GME, and when the shorting side doesn't understand to drop in time. It's an expensive lesson for them.\n\nI'm pro equities, so I can't subscribe to the notion of a \"Occupy Wall Street, part 2.\" But I can subscribe to the notion that it's a fair play to counter the shorts with investing/speculating from the opposite direction.

Between the politics, misinformation, manipulation, hivemind thinking, lack of education, and sheer variety of players involved, we're going to see the full spectrum of good and evil both winning and losing. It's going to be a wild ride. I hope that there's a net good that comes out of this, but negativity is certainly going to be thrown in both directions along the way.",

We sure as hell didn\u2019t anticipate political involvement. These are huge variables that weren\u2019t part of the original thesis. \n\nOne of the most important things one can do when investing is to check in with themselves and ask if the reasons that pushed them into the trade still exist. \n\nWell- gamma squeezes are done with how far otm MMs are placing new strikes. The premium for options is so high that they are hedged securely, and buy pressure is being suppressed with no signs of that changing.\n\nIn the end, the house always wins in this game. Taking profit is hard in a hysterical market. But that\u2019s how I personally know it\u2019s time to take profit. Be fearful when others are greedy.",

This is truly a once in a lifetime event and people with all sorts of agendas are hopping on board, but does it really matter (for now) if the end goal is the same? I've been a lurker over there for about a year now and yeah it sucks that for the moment the post quality has seriously gone downhill, but I'm writing it off as temporary. People are going to learn very quickly when this is all over that not every stock is GME and the hype chasers are gonna lose interest.\n\nThis could also be a r/GameOfThrones - r/freefolk scenario where the original subreddit starts to suck so we just congregate to a new one.\n\nI also think there's this impression that suddenly all these 'outsiders' with political agendas hopped on board, but I think people forget that humans are not one-dimensional and that you can be a WSB smooth brain while also having certain beliefs. Personally, I got in on GME solely for the gains, but it's an added bonus that it's bringing light to the control that big money has over the market and that this could actually cause some major wealth redistribution.",

For example any foreign country, which is in some kind of trading war with U.S. Or maybe a big multi-billionair, which simply wants to blow some other players in this game up.  \n\n\nI mean this big-player just needs to buy again and again. When this player makes it smart, it would also be possible to sell those shares later back to the market for the same or much higher price. For example by starting slowly and then increasing the volume exponentially.   \n\n\nAny ideas why we just see attacks from HF but not those kind of attacks?",

            "comment": "I love this analysis - it's great to be able to visualize how locking up the free float creates price volatility, which eventually leads to the big squeeze.\n\nIf I'm understanding correctly, there are a lot of questions we don't have clear answers to:\n\n* How much of the float is truly in play? Are shares included in mutual funds effectively locked up? I've heard one analyst say that he would expect only 10 million of the 51 million public float are actually in play.\n* How much of the float has already been locked up by truly diamond-hand longs?\n* How many shares are currently shorted? How much will short interest increase as the price drops further?\n   * We've been told today that multiple analyst firms now estimate the short interest at 20-25 million shares, down from around 60 million shares a few days ago. That strains credulity because a) We saw relatively low volume on Thursday and Friday, and b) We would expect the shorts to gain confidence and INCREASE their short positions at they drive the price down as they did on Thursday/Friday. If they believe the stocks is finally heading back to $20, won't they get back on the short train?\n* How much will retail sentiment factor into the remaining battle? Does WSB still have a major part to play by diamond-handing their shares, or is that part of the game already played out?\n\nThanks again for these posts, it's getting harder and harder to find good analysis of this situation.",

            "comment": "So I'm a complete newbie to investing. I bought into GME for 5k during the big attack on Thursday and ended up with a much better position than I should have had just on dumb beginner's luck accidentally nearly perfectly timing the ladder attack. I'd be disappointed if I were to lose everything, but ultimately it wouldn't affect my life in any way. I plan to hold it long and use this once in a lifetime event as a learning opportunity. If I break even, that's great. If I can show a profit, so much the better.\n\nI recognize that this post is related to my question, but I'm not sophisticated enough to understand it well enough to supply my own answer.\n\nI really like GME. I like it so much that I want more but I'm not willing to throw in any more cash because that would actually weaken my ability to hold it long term. I'd start caring about losing it.\n\nI'm an idiot but I have a lot of free time these days and have been reading a lot. Too much really, I should be sleeping more. I'm in for the ride, but I also recognize there's a certain number of people who just wanna make a couple quick bucks, that will panic sell at the next attack, cash out and 'paper hand' it 'too early' and so on.\n\nI have this idea of setting up like 2 shares at a sell stop (1k) limit (1.2k) with another 2 shares at a sell limit 1k, and a buy stop (1k) limit (600), with the idea being that if the HFs try to spike the price up to 1k causing people to cash out followed by an attack, I'd then grab up their stocks at a relative discount and increase my position overall without putting in any additional capital.\n\nOf course I respect the fact that I'm a moron and I might be missing something obvious, as well as the fact that the HFs are smarter, more experienced, better equipped, faster and more ruthless than I could ever be. So would I be playing into their game in some obvious way? My only true ambition is to break even on this whole experience, but obviously I'd like to do better if I can. From what I've learned so far I'd probably be giving them something in terms of margins, options, whatever which I'm still yet to understand at all. But wouldn't buying up a couple shares that were being sold anyway at no additional cost to me be a net positive if my basic position is to sit and hold? I'm very much on the squeeze or bust train and kinda plan figure out the rest from there.\n\nI'm sure I didn't format things correctly, so I'd appreciate any corrections and just overall relative risks and downsides to this idea considering my overall position.",

Which is cool and fits the spirit of holding more stock and that helps the cause. But it also increases your fear and greed gauge with every new share. Not a lot of people can handle seeing    10k (or a number they consider substantial) unrealized profit disappear in minutes and plunge into the red (have you ever asked yourself why trading platforms tend to display gains and losses very prominently in green and red?)\n\nYou must also understand that this is not investing. This is pure speculation. Investing is (should be) a net positive game (for the player A to win, player B does not have to lose). Speculation is a zero-sum game. And its worse than Vegas. In Vegas the house needs to tell you what your odds are.\n\nBut I like GME and I\u2019m holding on.",

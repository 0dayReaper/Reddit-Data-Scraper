Higher volatility will go up more in bull markets, down more in bear markets on average.

They will point out that a lump sum invested at the top of the bubble, with no additional funds added, would have taken until about 2015 to break even with SPY. I would point out that anyone that invests like that will do poorly. The QQQ ETF was created at the absolute worst time to invest in it, early 2000. Investing in the NASDAQ before the bubble, or after would yield outperformance. DCA into QQQ starting at inception, would yield outperformance, despite the bubble. Beware of the holding period cited. It's just as irrational as citing the 1929 crash for not investing in stocks until the 1960's which people did.",

There is a case to be made that picking stocks based off the exchange doesn't have meaningful benefit. I'd much prefer a \"growth index\" but my issue with those is some of the holdings don't even meet the stated requirements of the fund. The reason I like QQQ is that it contains more of the stocks I'd want to own long term...good growth prospects, high ROIC, and clean balance sheets. There is a lot of \"trash\" in the markets right now, fueled by cheap debt. The companies will survive and do fine, but returns will probably suck. I think GE, IBM, MMM, etc are more overvalued than MSFT or AAPL because they're just zombies.\n\n1a). Only 4% of stocks contribute to the overall returns of the market...I WANT to own the outliers and they should trade at a higher valuation.\n\n2). Factor investing will look terrible in hindsight (my opinion). The reason is because they are easily quantifiable (that's why academia loves it) and therefore it's easy to squeeze the excess returns out of the factor. I'm not being a smartass but find me a factor fund that outperforms. They all seem to work when the book is written and then not work after the fund has been launched.\n\n2a). I listed some factors above (ROIC, revenue growth) but I don't think a factor fund could use them because there's a lot of cyclical noise in them. US Steel has a high ROIC right now but I think we all know that's not sustainable. They still require some intelligent insight to make work, which is what I try to do.\n\n3). edit - forgot the international diversification point. I think people really overlook that US large caps are almost all internationally diversified within the business. The other thing I'd point out is that foreign companies do not have the same stated goals as US companies. For instance, Japanese companies exist for the benefit of their employees (imagine that). They hoard cash and have lower margins and ROIC not for the benefits of shareholders, but for stability. In the US markets, we have a different culture (for better or worse).",

Even setting aside the value factor, markets with a relatively higher P/E generally (not always) provide lower future returns than markets with a relatively lower P/E. If we disagree on this, then we may disagree on what drives stock returns in general. In my opinion, the best companies don't always make the best stocks, purely because of their valuations. I understand you disagree on this point, and that's fine because we have no clue what will happen going forward, but looking at the \\*data\\*, it would appear that \\*historically\\* what I have said tends to be correct. \n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to not have faith in the factors going forward. But you cannot cite data as the reason, as most data points towards the opposite.\n\nIf you are genuine in asking about a factor fund that outperforms the market, DFSVX.",

Because of OPs age, they are the perfect candidate for a small cap value tilt rather than a large cap  growth tilt.

With 45 years of runway OP has good odds of capturing the premium. The always quotable [Ben Felix] (https://youtu.be/2MVSsVi1_e4) can describe it best.\n\nIt should be noted that [QQQ has hardly done any better than the S&amp;P 500] (https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2023&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;leverageType=0&amp;leverageRatio=0.0&amp;debtAmount=0&amp;debtInterest=0.0&amp;maintenanceMargin=25.0&amp;leveragedBenchmark=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=QQQ&amp;allocation1_1=100)  with significantly more volatility: Lower risk adjusted returns.

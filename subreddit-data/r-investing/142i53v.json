I have 20% allocated to international because \"diversification\" but I'm starting to come to a conclusion that it is just \"worsification\".\n\nVanguard recommends 20-40% and their Target Date funds are heavy on international.  Bogle and Buffet recommended no international in the past.\n\nBack testing on Portfolio Visualizer show that Ex-US were absolutely crushed over the last 30 years with EMs doing slightly better than international developed but still crushed by Total US stock market.\n\nUS is where the innovation is and a much better business climate with less taxes and regulations than Ex-US developed markets.\n\nAs for EMs, they never seem to emerge.  The issue there is corruption and dictators that can change rules on a whim.\n\nWhat to do?",

Soviet communism, Iron Curtain economies like East Germany, China before they established their stock exchanges, the Japanese market's complete collapse in 1990 and afterwards... basically international economies have always been far behind the USA, but for some periods you can compare favorably the limited western European/Canadian/Japanese markets to the USA, but that is a fool's comparison because today broad international stocks now include all sorts of crap that weren't in existence in the 20th.  1980s East German automobile market was not more profitable than the US market was.\n\nYou are right, broad non-US investment has been terrible this century.  A sensible person should avoid it like the plague.  That doesn't mean though that _some_ international investment can't be good.  For example, FEZ (50 biggest companies in the Euro zone) did quite well earlier this year.  IMFL is a broad factor international ETF that is pretty new but its sister OMFL has a longer US history.  \n\nSeveral country-specific ETFs have done great this year, like GREK (Greece) and EWW (Mexico).  EWZ (Brazil) has great potential and is up 20% ytd.  ETC.\n\nYes, avoid de-worsifying your portfolio with thousands of garbage international stocks, but do look around for good opportunities wherever they are globally.",

With broad international stocks, imagine if North Korea were suddenly added to the mix, or Somalia.  Adding more previously destitute countries would not help a broad fund.  On the other hand, some folks suggest Chinese dominance in the future, which would dwarf the percentages of other areas in a broad international fund and thus possibly also beat the US alone.\n\nAll you have to do is, when that happens, if it does, rebalance your portfolio.  Now and for the past decade, broad international funds underperform, though as I mentioned some smaller- focuedare doing very, very well.  GREK is up 31% ytd.\n\nYou don't need to now, nor should you, base the bulk of your investments on what might happen in 15 years.  However hard it is to time the market tomorrow, timing for 15 years from now is a bad thing to do.",

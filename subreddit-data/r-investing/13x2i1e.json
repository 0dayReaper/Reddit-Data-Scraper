    "postText": "So recently I have  been looking into how to calculate intrinsic value as I want to set up a google sheet/excel so I can put in the info instead of always repeating the calculations.\n\nHowever, I am having a little trouble as im finding quite a few ways of how to calculate intrinsic value and was wondering which is the most common calculation/formula that is used or is use all and average the values out? I been look at Grahams revised and DCF formula. I have some stocks that i believe are at pretty good value but I want to do the calculations myself to compare to what analysis say.\n\nAlso if there is like a google sheet/excel with all the formula pre made or a youtube guide of how to set one up would be nice as well.\n\nThanks for all the help",

            "comment": "Peter Lynch's formula is really simple. Add the expected annual growth % to the dividend yield %, and divide that sum by the P/E. If the resultant is &lt; 1, it's overvalued; if it's 1 to 1.5 it's fairly valued; if it's around 2 it's undervalued, and if it's around 3 it's very undervalued. Whatever price makes that value 1.25 would be an appropriate \"intrinsic value\".\n\nWhat I do, is I imagine buying the company outright. If I paid market cap for the company, given current earnings and expected earnings growth, how long until I get my money back, and how much more will the company be worth by then? For a flat company with no growth, I want my money back in like 7 years. If they make $1b a year their market cap should be &lt;= $7b. That's a P/E of 7 of course.\n\nThey should be paying all of that $1b in dividends because they're obviously not investing any of it in growth, and the sale price should never go up if their earnings never go up.\n\nIf it is growing, then I can accept a longer period before I get my money back through earnings, because as their earnings increase, the sale price (market cap) should increase and I can exit early and still make a profit. In the above example, if they're growing at 15% per year, maybe I'll pay $17b for it (P/E of 17) because while I wouldn't get my money back for 9 or 10 years, I could sell it after 7 for $34b, assuming the P/E stays the same.\n\nIf you can figure out what you'd actually want out of the company if you were to buy every share and put your face on the front of the building, you can decide which of these intrinsic value formulas takes into account everything that's important to you. It could be as simple as looking at the P/E/G value. Maybe in your mind it makes sense to subtract expected inflation from G and add the dividend yield %.\n\nThe much harder part of all this is deciding what kind of expected growth is actually sustainable (if even possible). You can look at the balance sheet, consider the competitive moat, read what the analysts say, read the manager's biography, check historic growth, look at competitors, ask your cat, etc. but shelling out a fortune for a company that's not growing enough to justify it just doesn't make sense.\n\nA fair market like you see at the beginning of a bull run is going to be much more fixed on fundamentals, so lower P/E ratios vs. growth are more important to more investors. In a bloated market like you see before a crash, those fundamentals go out the window and the fair value is whatever the shoeshine boys say it is.",

            "comment": "Comment about Peter Lynch\u2019s method is decent - just adding another for context. \n\nI model out all of my investments with a DCF.  Most important understanding when modeling is that these models only predict the intrinsic value of a company when all of the assumptions are 100% correct (they\u2019re not). I use them mostly to figure out what the market is currently pricing into the share value. Using analyst consensus to drive FCFs and playing with exit multiples and discount rates, you can see what the business would have to do over the next x amount of years to be at current fair value. Can then do my own research and see if I think it\u2019s likely they will meet/beat/miss those forecasts.",

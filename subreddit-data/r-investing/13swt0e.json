    "postText": "I was considering purchasing a tax free muni ETF like RVNU or MIN, but I'm confused on some basics of it.  I wanted this because I have Cap-Gains taxed at 20%, so I figured I would gain an extra 20% on the yield by not paying taxes.  The fund RVNU has a -13.66% YTD yield, and I'm curious why the fund would have so much of a swing.  You are basically just purchasing a bunch of Muni bonds and let's assume a close to 0% default rate, isn't the fund basically worth the value of the bonds divided by the shares?  Why would it swing up and down so much?  What am I missing?",

It's considered interest income which is taxed as ordinary income. The interest from $RVNU should be Federal tax free. State taxes may vary depending on the underlying holding and your state of residency.",

When you require a higher/lower return from them, their present value falls/rises.  \n\nFor example, consider a ten year, zero coupon (for simplicity) muni bond. For it to yield 2.5%, it would be priced at  \n100/1.025\\^^(10yrs) = 78.12.  \nFor it to yield 4%, it would need to fall in price to  \n100/1.04\\^^(10yrs) = 67.56, a 13.5% drop.",

Bonds are taxed as regular income, not as if they were dividends. \n\nThey tend to start making sense when your tax bracket crosses into the 32% bracket. Before that, the after tax return from taxable bonds tends to be higher, but you have to do the math to make sure. Additionally, once you cross into that bracket you usually start owing the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) of 3.8% so the math works even more in your favor.",

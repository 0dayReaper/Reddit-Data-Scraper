However, I did this math and want to see if it makes sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found a $1 million dollar policy with a 40 year term for $110 a month. This would cost me $52,800 over the life of the policy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also calculated as if I contributed $110/month over 40 years I would have $389,454 (assuming an 8% return per year).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess the question is if the additional \\~$611,000 worth it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts, maybe $1 million is too much?

Will they be able to afford the house? \n\nThis is why term is a good choice , and here is the thing you ideally will need less and less term insurance as you age and as your kids grow up\n\nIf your 30 with a wife and two small kids and a mortgage with 300k left you might need at least a million or more dollars to make sure your spouse and kids are not in the poor house if you die as they grow up for the next 18-20 years\n\nFast forward if you are 40 you might need less insurance , now your kids only have 10 years or so before they are adults , you owe less on your mortgage maybe you only need 500k or something plus hopefully you will have other investments in your 401k/IRA \n\nFast forward to your 50 you probably now need even less insurance , enough to cover what is left on your mortgage/funeral cost something like 300k\n\nby the time you are 60 you should not need life insurance your kids should be adults and hopefully can take care of themselves , hopefully you have savings like a 401k/IRA if you die you won't put your wife and kids in bad financial situation",

Married, ok. Children? Mortgage? If you die, how much money does your wife need to go on. What does going on even mean - how does she imagine living in that case? Keep the house, move, job situation?\nJust being married might not warrant the need for an insurance in itself.\n\nYou should probably speak to a professional - together with you wife.\n\nFew considerations to keep in mind:\n- The earlier you start, the cheaper\n\n- In case of children, how is the money split between wife and children\n\n- Cost of the scheme\n\n- How can the scheme be invested\n\n- Can you pause or stop the payments in case you need to (loss of job)\n\n- Tax optimisation \n\n- Can you pledge it for a mortgage loan if needed\n\nThere are many things to consider.

As a grown adult, I suspect the answer is yes, so you don\u2019t need life insurance right now.\n\nMy recommendation is to buy a 20 year term policy as soon as you are expecting your first child. Maybe 30 years if you plan on having a lot of kids since it could be closer to 30 years before the youngest is an adult.\n\nYou haven\u2019t given us enough info to know if $1 million dollars is too much. That\u2019ll depend on your financial obligations like a mortgage and the standard of living you want to leave your family with if you die.\n\nAnd yes, never get whole life. It\u2019s a bad product that only makes sense for a very small number of very wealthy people.",

            "comment": "What you just laid out is the base case for whole life, or really more importantly permanent insurance. You are correct there is a 98% chance you will spend $50k in premiums with no value to show for it. Roughly 2% of term policies pay claims, that's why they are so heavily promoted they are a cash cow. With a permanent life policy, no you aren't going to earn 8% unless you go with a VUL but you are going to have a lower risk noncorrelated asset. And it is an actual asset. Term is only an asset if you die. \n\nYou could spend $100 a month for term life with nothing to show, or spend $400 a month with $50k of cash value in 10 years effectively giving you a net cost of $0. It's not a question of \"cost\" as I can layout that permanent life net over a periodf of 10 years or less \"costs\" less ($0 is less than $50k). It's a question of cash flow and can you cash flow the higher monthly premium.\n\nIt's no different than real estate. It's a no brainer that you are better off buying a nicer house in a nicer neighborhood than a modest house in a bad neighborhood. However, both houses provide you with the same benefit (shelter) but the nicer neighborhood will appreciate faster. But can you cash flow the higher monthly cost? That is the question.",

It's a much cheaper option for me than using an insurance company.  My wife also has a term policy through our insurance company, although with less coverage.  We both also have a 50k whole life policy.\nSome points to remember, insurance payouts are not part of your estate and are paid out directly to the beneficiary.  Having a nest egg and other assets are great, just don't end up up long term care or have a ton of end of life medical bills.",

            "comment": "A 40-year policy is too long for most people, and the length of it makes the policy way more expensive. You don\u2019t need life insurance at age 70. At that age you\u2019ll hopefully have saved a big nest egg, and anyone you\u2019d like to leave money to can inherit it directly from you if you die then.\n\nYou also don\u2019t need to have the same coverage the entire time. As your net worth gradually grows, you\u2019ll have less need for a big policy. For example, you could buy a $500K policy for 30 years, a $300K policy for 20 years, and a $200K policy for 10 years. This would give you $1M of coverage for the first ten years, $800K for the next ten, and $500K for the final ten. It would be less expensive than a 30-year policy with a $1M benefit while still meeting your needs. I stress that this is only an example, and you may want to be covered for only 25 years total.\n\nI would also consider whether you need life insurance *right now*. You didn\u2019t mention having a family. Does anyone depend on your future income? Does anyone depend on you being around to perform unpaid labor that they could pay someone to do if you died? If no to both, you may want to wait since you don\u2019t have a clear reason to be paying for insurance. If yes, that\u2019s how you can decide how much of a death benefit is needed.\n\nYes, avoid whole life insurance and any other form of permanent life insurance. I can link some explainers on that if requested.",

This is good if you don't have a good estate plan as it's not uncommon for probate to take a year or more.  Yes, spouses get access to things easier but all it takes is you forgetting to grant access to the account for things to get dicey for your spouse.",

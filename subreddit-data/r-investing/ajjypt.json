Only thing is that you me and everyone else doesn\u2019t see that public info until a news site picks it up and does a story because we don\u2019t have the time or wherewithall to scour through records on obscure sites or the resources to get people in the court room/house.\n\nSo someone could have just been extremely crafty in moving their way through a grey area. Having information before the news reports it isn\u2019t illegal. Or someone had a disgruntled high level exec who just watch their stock options fortune get fucked.\n\nThat being said, even with the exec in the pocket it can still be a grey area. If they told proper channels and then that exec hit up his trader immediately after about the news he technically isn\u2019t breaking the law. This stuff is extremely common on Wall Street - I suggest you watch the SAC Capital doc.",

If you bought $25,000 deep OTM worth of calls each in 10 different companies that were all really beaten down lately (like GE, Nvidia, Apple, etc..) You could just say you see the whole market as oversold and wanted to buy up a few companies that would bounce back harder when the rally you envision occurs. The return from this one would cover all that loss with a huge profit still, give you a reasonable alibi, and you might even make something off those other plays.\n\nAt the end of the day, they have to prove that you had access to non-public information. If you took some steps to make it seem more legitimate, they might not bother looking too hard. This guy is going to have a dedicated team of people going through every little hair inside his butthole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr just don't insider trade. It's really not worth it. You'll get busted, and they take all the profits as well as put you in prison. ",

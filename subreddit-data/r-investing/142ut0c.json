    "postText": "So I think I get the principle of how the US can be 20+ Trillion in debt and still be okay. The question I have is, although the government collects legitimate money, in order to finance more debt, they issue more debt. Like in order to pay off old bonds interest or total, they use money generated by the IRS + here is where the ponzi scheme starts, issue more debt. They are literally keeping us a float by issuing more debt to pay the existing debt.\r  \n\r  \nIn a ponzi scheme, you keep adding more investors to pay your existing investors. Now obviously the US has real income but part of that payoff plan is so ponzi-scheme like, how is it not? What am I missing here?",

Yes the past 20 years it has been rising faster .",

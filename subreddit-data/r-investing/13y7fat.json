    "postText": "Have a general question?  Want to offer some commentary on markets?  Maybe you would just like to throw out a neat fact that doesn't warrant a self post?  Feel free to post here! \n\nIf your question is \"I have $10,000, what do I do?\" or other \"advice for my personal situation\" questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:\n\n* How old are you? What country do you live in?  \n* Are you employed/making income? How much?  \n* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)  \n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  \n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  \n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)  \n* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?  \n* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.  \n\nPlease consider consulting our FAQ first - https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/faq\nAnd our [side bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/about/sidebar) also has useful resources.  \n\nIf you are new to investing - please refer to Wiki - [Getting Started](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/gettingstarted/)\n\nThe reading list in the wiki has a list of books ranging from light reading to advanced topics depending on your knowledge level.

I knew that was back then and that the market is not stupid anymore, too many smart people looking at it 24/7. Maybe you can make some gains with some insider information but other than that... No way. Well, meta proved me very wrong. When I saw the stock at 100 I put all my savings into it, I just could not believe it was happening but it was. The sentiment was at rock bottom for no good reason and it kept getting lower by the day. I knew it could go even lower than 100 and it did, I also knew it could take at least 5 years to see more nice gains. Fast forwards half a year or so and the stock is already up 150% and I have gained 35K in the process. Imagine that, 150% on a blue chip in 6 months, it goes to show that this game is not that hard, as long as you are patient (these opportunities don't come around every day) and most Important you need to be able to believe very strongly In yourself because when 99.9% of people are calling you stupid and the price keeps dropping you need to keep sleeping well",

It was mostly because earnings went down which is expected in times of Economical uncertainty and it was easy to see it was not business related since it affected all other companies that do advertising. The most important thing affecting the price was mark zuckerberg himself, he has control of the company and cannot be replaced, people thought he was blinded by VR and would bankrupt the company. I however disagreed, he is a smart man and knows what he is doing, he did make a mistake by spending a bit too much during a time of uncertainty but he quickly fixed it. People also had the impression that he was spending 80% of the money in VR when in truth it was more like 20%, the rest was going to the core business.",

I like tech though a lot more more than pharma \"growth\", so if you _want_ to broaden things MGK has merit.\n\nSCHD is currently useless, and at your age emphasis on dividends is counterproductive.\n\nSOXX is good, especially since you also have XSD in the Roth.\n\nYou have 47.23% more VOO than I would, with my interest in tech and making money.  My base holding is XLK, with IYM and QQQ.  The I like at least the three big semi ETFs, the two you have plus SMH because together they cover more and I can adjust my weighting easier with all three... like if I want more NVDA, I add SMH, if I want less NVDA I add XSD.\n\nVGT is an excellent holding, but again I prefer XLK and suggest you compare the two as you basically get a lot of smaller companies with it that historically underperform (slightly) the larger ones.  Alos XLK's mix got a lot better this year by shedding the 13 financial stocks like Visa that have held it down over the years.\n\nJEPI is a dog inferior to VOO, but better in a Roth where its tax drag at least won't kill you.\n\nSo, you look fine to me, but I'd encourage you to at least make some paper portfolio competitors of what you hold and measure your performance against those.",

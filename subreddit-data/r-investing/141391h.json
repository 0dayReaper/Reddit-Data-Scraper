The latter also has a recurring revenue membership component. I believe grocery is typically viewed as an unfavorable mix component, so the diversified retailer profile is likely a contributing factor.",

For example, say Walmart beat revenue estimates and guided higher on the year, but it\u2019s driven by grocery. The flow through to Net Income and FCF yield won\u2019t be as high as if it was from a higher margin segment.\n\nI also think the notion of defensive stocks is fairly flawed. I was taught cigarette companies are defensive but people have largely quit smoking. I also see hype around dollar stores pop up whenever recession fears spike, despite the fact they largely sell useless shit and people cut back heavily on useless shit when money is tight. I just don\u2019t like the whole \u201cpeople always pay their mortgage\u201d mindset- it didn\u2019t work so well in 08.\n\nIMO there just isn\u2019t much of a point in defensive stocks when you\u2019ve got 5%+ CDs, but that\u2019s just my ignorant opinion lol",

Walmart, Target, and Costco are huge retail players with a massive presence and a broader range of products letting them diversify their revenue streams. \n\ntheir size and reach allow them to enjoy economies of scale, which means they can negotiate better deals with suppliers, lower costs, and offer competitive prices to customers. this tends to attract more investors and positively impact their valuation multiples.",

My memory from college is that everything was about 1.5x the Walmart price and it had about 10% as many people shopping.  The gas at their gas station was the most expensive in town also.  I used the video store they had in it because I had late fees at all the other stores in town.\n\nAlbertson\u2019s stock 5Y 34%\n\nSP500 5Y 54%",

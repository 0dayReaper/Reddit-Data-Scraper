In 1998 this changed to percentage, but the levels were set at 10%, 20%, 30%. Which is why 2008 never triggered despite the Dow having a few -7.x% days and the S&amp;P having a few -8.x% days.",

Do you think this sudden drop, which correlates very closely with COVID-19 hitting the US time-wise, has more to do with that, or some economic problem?\n\nHonestly, I think the market was looking for an opportunity to correct itself. Trump and the Fed have been doing everything they can to make that not happen, so its been floating along wanting to correct itself. To me, this is the opportunity it was finally able to use.\n\nPersonally, I think we're going to see another week or two of this, along with another 10-20% in drops, and then we're going to flatten-out. Things will probably stay that way until we've reached a sense of normalcy, at which point things will begin to trend back up.",

I'm no scientist but this seems like it'll be worse in 2 weeks and if everything is shutdown and nobody is spending which this economy depends on, the market's just going to get worse.  I'm thinking if you wait 4 weeks or months you still can't time the low but you'll have way more shares than if you auto invested in a weekly or biweekly right now.",

Following that crash, we saw the rise of online platforms that made trading easier than ever, which drew more people into the markets. Demand for stocks grew much faster than the companies themselves, and the prices skyrocketed up until this past month. With a lot of people now able to sell themselves, they are likely driving prices down since there\u2019s such a large flow of sell orders to fulfill at market price. Think about BTC, and how once it became a hot topic and everyone wanted it, its price went way up. Then as the craze cooled down, we saw its price also come down. Another huge factor that plays in was the rise of ETFs, or a bundle of stocks. Instead of creating a huge sell off of individual stocks, people are now essentially selling off entire markets, just as they were buying them before. However, the long bull market never corrected because people bought and held for such a long period, then bought more as they earned more money. Eventually there was more money invested in ownership of all these companies than there was actual production. Were all of these companies really worth as much as people were paying for them? Absolutely not. It was a bubble of a different sort. The same amount of cash that was in the economy a month ago is still the same today. So how are people able to buy so much with such a limited supply of cash? The answer is credit. What we\u2019re currently looking at is a large amount of credit being wiped out. People would see above average gains, feel rich, look rich on paper, and borrow money for big purchases \u2013 essentially buy real things with \u201cfake money.\u201d The coronavirus may have triggered this sell off and what mainstream media is blaming, but there were a lot of inherent issues that needed to be \u201ccorrected.\u201d The prices of stocks grew, but the actual value of what companies were producing didn\u2019t. Now we\u2019re seeing it come back down to match the value of productivity. But once this sell off is over, we\u2019ll probably see some stagnation as the coronavirus has halted a lot of production in a lot of countries and quarterly earnings will be way down. Then as companies get back on their feet, we\u2019ll see another long bull market because as a younger tech savvy generation begins to invest, they\u2019ll do the same buy and buy and buy with ETFs and stocks until another big scare hits mainstream media. I\u2019m no expert, these are just my thoughts.\n\nEdit: to add to this, it\u2019s the extremely wealthy that will be hit the hardest. I\u2019m really hoping that this crash will spill over into more tangible markets so that average people are able to afford housing and the ability start their own businesses. Just remember to be productive and spend your money on productive things rather than things that decrease in value over time. No need to flash your money with fancy cars or expensive dinners unless you\u2019ve made it to the top and it\u2019s just pocket change",

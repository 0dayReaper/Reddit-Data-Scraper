            "comment": "Basic facts:\n\n* 28 years, Europe\n\n* Employed, $ 70,000 net per year, financial job\n\n* Objective: save, invest and multiply. Minimum protect against inflation.\n* Time horizon: long-term\n* Risk tolerance: High rewards only come from high risks. I won't gamble everything and understand risk, and know that 100 % safe assets won't earn me a reward above inflation.\n* I keep a \"balance sheet\" of myself. Composition:\n*- 21 % in bank accounts\n*- 5 % forex (reserve currencies)\n*- 7 % certificates from a bank (floating interest rate, min. 3,2 %, due 2028, market price now down by a few %, but will hold)\n*- 19 % private loan, will be re-paid half of that soon.\n*- 6 % my car (based on periodically updated estimates using official Eurotax-valuation) plus other small assets\n*- 11 % gold\n*- 30 % ETFs\n* Debt: usually a few hundred on credit card, but that's paid within one month, no interest on that, only annual fee. My expenses are about 35-40 % of my net income, so I can save the majority. In my balance sheet I keep some smaller provisions.\n* I track my expenses to the cent and keep a cash-flow forecast. I constantly update it, e.g. to changing fuel prices, changes in salary,...\n\nMy main \"problem\" is: I have a net worth of about $ 230,000, and of that around $ 80,000 will soon be in cash (part of the loan I gave out will be re-paid soon). I'm hesitant what to do with it. I have a quite frugal lifestyle and save 60 % + of my income, aim is to save up money for a house and comfortable future life, maybe found my own company one day or buy (parts of) one, and simply have a nice cushion.\n\nNow we have inflation of close to 10 %. Because of my work I don't believe that inflation will recede to normal levels of 2 % soon. So I see all my cash becoming less and less valuable. On the other hand, I have seen my portfolio of ETFs barely moving now for two years. The bank collects fees for the depot, the ETFs collect managing fees, so in effect I lost money here. You know what the stock market was like last year, and if I look at larger ETFs aimed at e.g. S&amp;P500, MSCI World,.., the historical development in almost all shows nice returns in 2020, 2021-2022 close to 0, and this year... well... a bit up.\n\nWith regards to the stock market in general: for me it's a casino, plain and simple. The P/E-ratios of some companies are batshit crazy, hyped up stocks like Tesla represent a large share of the market, but all it seemingly takes are over-optimistic presentations of Elon Musk promising new features to make our friends at /r/wallstreetbets go crazy for the stock, and that's not an isolated case. I've studied this stuff and had to learn among other things how to value companies (DCF is always a fun exercise, particularly when defending why the result is higher than with the common EBITDA-multiples for the sector), and since several years they hype around loss-making companies with big promises has become the norm. Who here remembers the hype around WeWork? All based on the idea that this company is a \"tech unicorn\"... because... eeehhh.. they rent office space like tons of other commercial property owners? How many of you actually looked at their website like I did? What's the \"tech unicorn\" part there? I know at least five better search engines for office space, and yes, co-working spaces are not a new idea. It seems like make-belief and hype are the most important ingredients to a company's success, and all major indices are littered with what I consider to be money-machines for a few eccentric founders (Tesla helps Elon go to Mars, WeWork's boss is well-known for his thirst for money,...).\n\nOn the other hand, despite all my aversion to major stock markets, I do understand that some companies are legitimally hyped, e.g. I understand Nvidia, I understand that if e.g. an energy company patents a new type of power generation the stock can increase in double or triple digits,..., I understand the business side and what a muitiplying of revenues combined with protected intellectual property can mean for future P&amp;Ls of a company. Here I see the value. The problem I have more is that the indices are littered with \"non-value hypes\", on the other hand if I'd pick individual stocks I'd have to invest much more time. And of course hype-stocks produce higher returns, regardless of whether there's value behind or not. And I'm willing to take some risk.\n\nI'm considering spending more on gold. I have equally little faith in our economies as a whole, we stayed afloat after Corona because of massive government spending. America as one edge compared to Europe: during Corona, you let your employees be fired en masse, supported the unemployed, and later those got new jobs, and some companies didn't make it despite PPP. In Europe everything was \"frozen\", so we now have - my feeling - more companies that should have closed long ago, but were kept alive artificially. Gold is a safe haven.\n\nCrypto and real estate are the two asset classes I have skipped completely. Crypto has no value in my eyes, it's more like gold these days. So as a hedge against the stock market - fine. The problem is more that all these traders we have around here don't do their homework on taxes, so while my bank does taxes automatically for my depot, crypto traders just trade, and I'm left with the mess of taxation. Some work better, and there are some companies specialized in this, but the complexity of national and international taxation would force me to have a tax advisor do this for me, and that costs extra money and time. Laws are being adapted, and gradually more of the traders integrate automatic taxation, then I would consider joining the game.\n\nReal estate for me is just too much money tied up at one place. If I buy a house now, I'm not sure if I'd ever use it for myself, given that I move around a bit for my job. Renting it is no option, too many bad experiences in my circle of relatives / acquaintances who do rent. And prices are too damn high for me, especially considering that increasingly both left- and right-wing parties want \"rent brakes\", that would decimate both rental incomes and values of real estate. Costs of living are edging higher and higher, and sooner or later governments might intervene. Plus I have limited faith in the economy in general, I won't go into detail on that.\n\nTrading apps (European equivalents of RobinHood) are not my preferred choice either. One major reason is again the taxation, they do the trading, and I'm left with the mess of having to determine the correct taxes... fun when you use e.g. ETFs from ten different tax jurisdictions. Plus the fees / spreads on some are just horrendous, with my current bank I have quite solid deals (family relationship with the bank, so my rates / fees are OK) and no tax-trouble. Also I'm not that experienced with derivatives, and these are in my eyes better for people with more time on their hands - my workdays usually are 10 hours or more and lots of outside stuff.\n\nWhat I actually am trying to buy are two products, one is a protection against inflation (base interest rate plus inflation rate, but only if one stock index doesn't lose more than 50 % over the next 5 years), and the other is a bet on another stock index, if that index in 5 years is at or above the current value I get 153 % back, otherwise 100 %. But I'm having some troubles buying these products.\n\nSo now you know some things about me. I'm not sure what to do with my money, I only know that I don't want it to be eaten away by inflation. I have limited faith in the economy and the stock market overall, too much is artificially pumped up, but OK, I'm willing to take risk. What are your recommendations?",

The company has gone through 4 or 5 rounds of layoffs since 2020. Employees in 2020 received a 1-year salary as severance, thanks to COVID-era funds. That is all dried up now, I guess, as none of us this round received anything from what I can tell. There was no notice of the layoffs, and in my state I believe it's required, so I am going to chat with a lawyer about that.",

Higher risk adjusted returns is better. Lower risk adjusted return is worse.  \n\n&gt;particularly when adjusted for common factors like value and quality  \n\nValue refers to stocks of companies which are priced low compared to the amount of profits the company is making. Quality refers to stocks of companies with profits that are consistent and have high margins and low debt.   \n\nStocks with high dividends are often also value stocks. Stocks with consistently rising dividends are also often quality stocks. If you control for value and quality, there is no need to look at dividends. Those factors are a better characterization of how a stock moves than dividends.    \n\n&gt;If you are looking for a 30 year drawdown, 20-40% bonds is appropriate.  \n\nIf you want to withdraw 1000 a month from a 300k portfolio for 30 years before you die, then a good portfolio would be between 20 and 40% bonds (things like BNDW, SCHP) plus 80-60% stocks (things like VTI, VXUS).   \n\n&gt;For a perpetual withdrawal, you will want want 80-100% equities.  \n\nIf you want to withdraw 1000 a month for much longer than 30 years, the  you will need to take on more risk by increasing the amount of stocks (things like VTI, VXUS), and lowering the amount of bonds (things like BNDW, SCHP).  \n\n&gt;I'm sorry, I didnt understand a thing you said this time, remember I'm a beginner to this, so I dont understand that much.  \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/gettingstarted  \nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy  \n\n&gt;Also you didnt mention any dividend ETF  \n\nCorrect  \n\n&gt;and I was hoping you mention it because I ve been looking in to Peter Schiff dividend fund and others like SCHY.  \n\nI see no reason to buy a fund based on dividends",

After doing some research I have put together a portfolio of 94% stock and 6% bonds that is allocated into some broad ETFs. I know the portfolio may be a bit overkill in terms of specifics, but it is largely low-cost and gives me some freedom to adjust the different allocations as I see fit. Here is how I have it allocated:\n\nInternational: 14% VEA 9% VWO\n\nDomestic: 53% VOO 11% VXF 7% SCHD\n\nBond: 4% BND 2% BNDX\n\nAny thoughts/input would be helpful, and I am wondering if this is too specific and if I should instead just hold VTI/VXUS.",

Are you concerned about losing your job because of some temporary hype in May 2023?  Of course not.  You answered your own question.  After a pandemic, supply chain issues, and a recovery from a pandemic, we are entering a new period of innovation.  Not investing in it now would be a big mistake... or not investing with worrying about Skynet taking your job.\n\nI don't have any clue why you are having so much trouble, or any ideas about how things wouk in your country, but invest something in the equivalent of QQQ and XLK and you instantly will have a large hedge against your personal career concerns.",

Most of them should have an app or at least a website. I didn't have to post anything for mine but it might be different in your country.\n\nIf you're very risk averse you should invest in index funds rather than picking stocks. You may even want to include some bonds as a hedge against market volatility so you won't be as tempted to panic sell. If AI turns out as big as you're concerned it will, the companies that succeed in it will end up at the top of indexes anyway.\n\nI am also a SWE and I'm not really worried about AI. So far it can only generate code that solves problems close to something someone else has solved and put on the internet. It might be used as a productivity multiplier and might end up reducing headcount or salaries, but if you're worth your salt I don't think you'll lose your job to AI any time soon.",

But a lot of problems in software engineering are... kind of close to something someone else has solved - a lot of it is fitting together libraries and services that already exist, with bits of business logic scattered about. I've used ChatGPT 4.0 and it often making mistakes and isn't really particularly useful at getting things right, today.\n\nBut 1 year ago it couldn't produce a particularly convincing English sentence, and today it's writing code at a junior level with a few mistakes. 5 years... unless progress really stagnates, I worry.\n\nYou're right, I think a reduction in head count... and I'm probably senior enough not to be cut immediately. But there's always been a huge demand for software engineers driving salary - it'll have impact on the industry.\n\nThe next decade will certainly be interesting, I think.",

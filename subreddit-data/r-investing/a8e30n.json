It\u2019s also not clear if the president will be impeached or not in the coming months.

That means that I just got 10% more shares for my money than I got for the same contribution two weeks ago in my last paycheck.  \n\nNow, if I had just retired I'd be more concerned, though obviously I'd be mitigating my risk with a tent.  \n\nThe sad thing is that 10 years ago I didn't understand this well and I saw all the market troubles as a reason NOT to invest.  In reality they were a reason to celebrate.  \n\nHere is today's headline for anybody who is contributing to a 401k:  \"Stock exchange announces pre-Christmas sale on stocks.  All offerings are 10% off this week!  Return your purchases at any time for full retail price!\"",

Historically whenever unemployment is at its lowest, most people earning= most people spending, but as and when the the unemployment rates go up, spending power of the common man decreases (partial stimulus to the economy)\n\n3.Gradual increase of historically low interest rate (people ask why interest rates? Simply put, its the cost of borrowing money, when does cost go up when demand is high and supply is low, I.e the monetary stimulus is slowly but gradually withering)\n\n4.Oil prices have a similar correlation, they have been dwindling and should touch atleast 35$ based on the the bottom tangent set based on a 20 year chart. \n\n5.The world outlook isn't that certain with alot of important elections which effect the economic and social situations of countries ( US, Canada, India) Plus Brexit. \n\n6.The US economy is facing relative competition from the Chinese economy ( which will be the largest by 2035 or so based on PWC 2050 report) Also, the addition of the yuan as a reserve currency by the IMF as more and more country move towards holding the Yuan. What happened  to the Pound during the 1960-1980, should happen to the dollar as power transitions. \n\n2019 will definitely be a rocky one. \n\nAny suggestions or contradictions to the above points are welcome ( As we learn the most with a healthy discussion/debate)\n\nThank you for reading and happy holidays :) \n",

We\u2019re down roughly 15% from our September high, but it\u2019s happened through steady, gentle decline. We close down 1%-2% a few times per week instead of having a big dramatic crash.\n\nA bear market requires a 20% drop within 60 days. The S&amp;P 500 is close to hitting the percentage of loss, but it\u2019s happening too gradually to qualify.

His research attempted to provide an understanding and explanation of the characteristics of financial crises, which he attributed to swings in a potentially fragile financial system. Minsky is sometimes described as a post-Keynesian economist because, in the Keynesian tradition, he supported some government intervention in financial markets, opposed some of the financial deregulation policies popular in the 1980s, stressed the importance of the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort and argued against the over-accumulation of private debt in the financial markets.Minsky's economic theories were largely ignored for decades, until the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008 caused a renewed interest in them.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/investing/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

However the same is true on wall street: if you knew there would be a perfectly level expansion, everyone would lever up on margin and buy whatever they could. Sellers would obviously see the same, and would pull back selling price to much higher. Some buyers who weren't savvy would then hit the ask, and that would be the new market price. Momentum traders would follow this breakout and push prices even higher. And then they'd collapse back to the trendline, and then below as the unsavvy investors switch to fear and panic selling. \n\nAnd what should have a linear slow March upwards would look, well, indistinguishable to the current market, filled with exuberance and desolation in book busy periods.

    "postText": "Hello, my name is Dami\u00e1n, I am from Argentina and I am 21 years old. My country is economically very unstable, so people are constantly looking for alternatives to protect their money. It makes me doubt that they invest in the US and what tools they have. What interests do they have? can they invest little money? Can they withdraw whenever they want? \n\nThank you for your responses and sorry for the inconvenience.",

Meanwhile, the Fed is near its peak rates and any future move would likely be a cut, lowering the dollar strength.\n\nAlso, in uncertain times right now in Argentina, I don't know if OP has the luxury of \"5-10 year time horizon\" like most average US investor. Can he even easily access his funds? What if the Argentina bank breaks down? Can he even withdraw his money then?\n\nGold can easily be carried and sold in the black market.",

(https://www.robo-advisorfinder.com/locations/argentina) I would definitely check.  Endowus has Dimensional which is a terrific shop  https://endowus.com/factor-investing.",

            "comment": "There is no one answer to your question, as there are many variables in picking a 'good' investment. Timing of purchases, investment objectives (e.g. growth vs. dividends vs. protection of capital), economic factors in the country you plan to invest in, etc. Certainly, it does no good to keep your money in Argentina, I read last month that inflation had reached 96% - wow! \n\nIn theory, although I am unfamiliar with securities trading in Argentina, your investing account should allow you to access foreign investment vehicles, and allow you to hold and accumulate profits, if you make any. The problem is that there is no safe investment vehicle which will allow you to outpace your country's inflation level. The best you can do at your age is to start investing for the long term and taking the time to learn how to manage your choices. Ideally, you would convert your monies into a more stable foreign currency, such as the USD.\n\nI agree with others here that gold is looking like a continued strong investment for at least the balance of this year, but spread your risks among several strong choices. Look at GOLD, or GDX.\n\nFor stocks, in no particular order, I would suggest NVDA, GOOG, MSFT. Beyond that it really depends on whether you will be an active trader, or a buy &amp; hold investor. BABA, ZM and BIDU can make good profits when timed well.\n\nU.S. Treasuries are very safe, and I saw an ad on the Pilot app offering 5.2%.",

    "postText": "I frequently trade SPY options, and when talking with my friend recently, he brought up [Section 1256 rules](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section-1256-contract.asp) that basically allow you to claim 60% of your profits trading any eligible instrument at favorable long term capital gains rates regardless of how long you held the position. Looking at XSP, a lot of sources [claim they qualify for this treatment](https://www.cboe.com/insights/posts/how-taxing-is-your-options-trade/), at the very least under certain circumstances. In addition, the wash sale rule does not apply to these instruments and they are European-style exercise options, meaning you don't have the risk of assignment before the expiration date. All of these seem like substantial benefits to trade XSP over SPY options. The only downside I see is that the volume of XSP seems to be far less than SPY. Does anyone do this? What exactly has to be done to claim the tax benefit here? Is it even worth it considering the volume difference?",

But IIRC it's not as tight as SPY, but worth it if you trade short term positions.\n\nIt's not more popular because you need to use options only, you can't buy XSP as-is.",

I suspect that many people will tend to trade SPX index options or /ES fops instead. \n\nI think that many retail investors are generally scared off by the fact that XSP and SPX are cash settled. But I suspect that it's mostly lack of understanding of options and also the availability of section 1256 contracts in general.",

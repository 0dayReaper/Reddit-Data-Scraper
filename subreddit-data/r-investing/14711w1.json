    "postText": "I\u2019d like some feedback on a HSA portfolio. As you may know, HSA dividends and capital gains are taxed in California. I\u2019m young and fairly healthy, but I anticipate accessing the funds throughout the year for healthcare expenses. I would like to have somewhat balanced growth and capital preservation, but I also want to be tax efficient.\n\nMy thought was something like \n\n50% GOVZ\n\n30% SCHG (VUG as tax loss partner)\n\n20% XBI   (IBB as tax loss partner)\n\nThe zero coupon treasury bond allocation is in anticipation of a long term declining trend in interest rates.\n\nThe equities allocation is to keep the dividend yield minimal but leave the potential for growth intact.\n\nAn alternate idea is\n\n50% GOVZ\n\n50% VOO (IVV as tax loss partner)\n\nIn all cases, I would use new funds to rebalance the allocations and occasionally sell and buy to rebalance as necessary. \n\nAny feedback or suggestions appreciated.",

So the remainder would be split equally between treasury funds and equity ETFs.",

I'd just throw it all the investable portion in  brk.b , which doesn't pay dividends so should be tax efficient and is plenty diversified. For the funds you need through out the year, you should leave a cash balance or short term tbills  if your hsa allows them.",

I was informed that they will auto liquidate FDLXX (treasury-only money market) for debits, so that\u2019s where the spending money would be held. \n\nThree funds and some cash in a money market overly complicated? I really don\u2019t mind tending to it and I\u2019ve found some tax loss harvesting partner ETFs for each allocation. \n\nI\u2019m not opposed to simplification though, any suggestions other than BRK.B for the equities allocation?",

But if the bond funds rise significantly in value due to declining prevailing interest rates, I would sell to buy more BRK.B and rebalance the allocations. Capital gains on treasury bonds are taxed by California as ordinary income, so harvesting losses on the bond fund is a good idea, I can rotate between the three funds every so often whenever they\u2019re showing a loss.",

I figure that if the market crashes, interest rates will come down. If they don\u2019t come down, I\u2019m essentially halving my returns from my equities allocation, which I am okay with in this account where I may need to access the funds periodically throughout my working life.",

    "postText": "Back story on me, Im a single 34y/o self taught artist. I made some pretty bad financial decisons in my 20 s that ive slowly been working my way out of. I dont have to much debt under 5k but i have on repo on my record (gross I know). I planned on paying it all off by the end of summer. I live nomadically and well below my means. Anyways, my father is in control of an UGMA UTMA account  of mine (with about 16k in it)  and has been forever. Unless he releases the money or i take him to court (which I will not, because money at the end of that isnt worth that much hassle to me) I dont have access to it. At first this was frustrating to me, but now not so much. My Father has seen me make better financial decisions and in turn has given me loans against my nest egg. i dont mind doing this but im at a point where i would rather just ask him to invest somewhere where i can do somthing similar. A type of savings account that accures interests that i can also take loans against. He always talk about IRAs or 401ks, others have told me about whole term life insurance policies but all of this is another langauge to me.  Im totally clueless. Im a fucking artist. Im just grateful people even buy my work, but im past that now and need to figure out how to keep my buisness growing and invest this nest egg.",

Im trying to find a good investment account for 16k, that accrues interest. with possiblites of using for secured loans.  the whole reason this deals with my dad is because he is the one who controls the account. Im just trying to find it a place that he feel like isnt a bad investment, and i can use later for my benefit. Im not at all familiar with investing out side of savings account and semi precious stones/metals. THIS IS FUCKING WHY YOUR GETTING A BACK STORY YOU TROLL STFU",

It took me a few years to gain my inventory ,skill level and travel experience to get where i am at. Ive traveled all over the world to source my stones at a much cheaper rate. These brave endeavours benefited me 10 fold.  I dont really want this extra money. Everything ive amassed to far I did by litterally rock collecting. Thats the cool thing about semi precious metals and stones, people always want them and they usually only go up in value. Ive seen litterally hobos, turn into multi millionaires just by digging for the right rocks. Anyways, I just want to put this money somewhere as like a nest egg for a future , with the options to take a no interest or low interest loan out against it if need be. I enjoy my lifestyle and fund it just fine. I also could continue to still use my dad as a secured credit card, that also works. I would just rather have it making money instead of just sitting there like it is. Its only 16k, but I want to put it some where it will GROW. Im 34, I wanna make up for my time fucking off, so i can continue my lifestlye while saving for a rainy day.",

Figure out your monthly expenses, multiply it by 6 (for 6 months safety net) and stick that in a high yield savings. I recommend Marcus by Goldman Sachs. That money is federally insured up to 250k and you\u2019ll earn the current interest rate (4.15% right now). \n\nYou\u2019re not eligible for any kind of 401(k). Those are employer sponsored and you are self employed so forget about that. \n\nThe remaining money should go into an IRA. I recommend opening one with Fidelity. There are two types: traditional and Roth. With Roth you pay taxes now, but the investments grow tax free and you aren\u2019t taxed when you withdraw. With traditional IRA, no tax now, but you pay taxes on any gains when you withdraw. Keep in mind you can\u2019t touch the money until your 59.5 years old, or you\u2019ll pay a fee. \n\nI recommend the traditional IRA given you are a novice and probably don\u2019t want a hefty tax bill right now. \n\nWhen you open the fidelity account, there is an annual contribution limit (currently 6,500/year). When you deposit the cash it will show up as a money market fund (don\u2019t worry about the lingo) it acts very similar to a checking account except you earn interest. \n\nI would buy $1 of FXAIX - its a mutual fund that tracks the s&amp;p and regularly pays out dividends. You need to buy at least $1 for the next part - auto investing. Once you have the $1 in FXAIX, go to the fidelity search bar and search automatic investment. Set it up so that it invests $500/month into FXAIX, that will keep you under the 6,500 annual limit and it invests by itself (aka set it and forget it). Let it auto invest until it is fully invested and just go about your life. This is pretty basic investing, but I think it makes sense for your situation. \n\nI hope this helps. Good luck.",

Add up how much you owe every month, year, etc. Even if your income is irregular, you can save a chunk of it in a bank account that you don't touch except to pay those bills (separate from your food, gas, etc).\n\nOnce you have enough in that account to pay for several months of bills, put all your bills on autopay so you never miss them, and keep contributing to the account from your income.\n\nAssuming your father is not a sociopath, you will NEVER get a better deal on a loan than from family. If he's willing to lend you money, use that to jump start your bill autopay account. You can pay back with flexible terms, but you'll benefit tremendously from having all of your own obligations paid on time, every time.\n\nAnd if you don't already, keep a balance sheet for your business activities. Set benchmarks for yourself, track progress. You will be surprised how quickly putting all this stuff on paper results in having more money in your pocket to fund the stuff you love.",

All loans were paid back. I just call my dad a secured dredit card Because the money is there.  Like i said before, Im a van dweller.

It is better to be ahead of the ball than to have some shitty thing happen at the worst time and then a kick in the nuts for a loan to pay back.\n\nThis will give you some more mental leeway.

Fair enough, but giving specifically targeted advice from just a couple of text blocks of your bio would be irresponsible of we who answered you.\n\nAs for land, I didn't suggest improved land.

Property taxes will be low, and you could buy in an area you think might be beneficial for your geologic interests. An example of this situation is a little spot named Gemfield, NV. (Not for sale, I'm sure, but Google Earth it.) Although you can't get a mortgage to buy unimproved land, it doesn't take much to change that situation for a later loan. Of course it depends on where you would buy the land.\n\nIt's great that you have a reliable financial backstop in your dad. why don't you have a few heart to heart talks about direction, and heed his advice as he seems to have been at least somewhat successful.

I listened to that little voice that said \"do something practical\" and it sounds like you are hearing that voice now.  \n\nFirst and easiest thing to do is to set up a Roth IRA account.  The limit goes up every year, but my advice is to max that thing out every year.  \n\nIf you actually have a job that offers a 401k, then contribute at least enough to get the company match maxed out (that's free money).  If you can afford more, do more.\n\nIf you are self employed look at setting up a SEP IRA.  You can actually contribute a lot of money that way.  \n\nWhole Life is garbage, don't do it.  \n\nThe main key here is to put money into those programs until it hurts.  And I mean hurts.  At least 15% of your income? But if you can do 25% or 50%, go crazy and do it.  The more you front load now and make the sacrifice, the more compound interest will take care of you.  Get your UTMA money and put it in these investment vehicle. \n\nRule of thumb: you want to retire with 25x your living expenses in investments.  But after 25 years, inflation will make you need double that, so better to shoot for 50x of your living expenses today.  Use a simple investment calculator (like the Dave Ramsey investment calculator - I like it because it is super easy to understand) to calculate how much money you need to be putting away monthly.  \n\nInvest your money in a low cost etf like VTI or VOO or, frankly, anything that has a very long term track record of delivering an average return of over 11%. \n\nGood luck",

I believe M1 offers margin on taxable brokerage accounts starting at $10k balance. I used to this as leverage when money was cheap (I think mine was 3.50%), but right now money is expensive. Consider getting a high yield savings account or money market fund. Also, you probably know this by now, but if you\u2019re in the US, I\u2019d look into cheap parking areas around Sedona. You could probably squeeze some good returns with their tourist economy.",

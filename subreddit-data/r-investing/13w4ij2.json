    "postText": "I have been watching $SCHD for a while and noticed it's hovering around $70 in the last few weeks. YTD it shows a larger underperformance relative to S&amp;P500 (probably the largest in its history).\n\nI've never own any dividend fund but it feels like SCHD has a very solid screening criteria. It looks more like a quality-focus fund than a yield-focus one. It just happens to have relatively good dividends. That said, I can only add it in a taxable account due to limited space in our Roth/IRAs. I wonder if it worth holding with tax considered compared to index like VOO or VTI in a long run. Any thought would be highly appreciated!",

            "comment": "SCHD's holdings vary each quarter, sometimes by a bunch, while VOO's holdings change slightly yearly.  Right now SCHD has been basically tricked into overvaluing pharmaceuticals (because of covid) and oil/gas (because of Russian war), and thus is -6% ytd while VOO is +11%.\n\nFactor ETFs rely on past data so are a bit backward looking but that normally is mostly a good thing.  But Covid and the Russian war were abnormal and very strong influences.\n\nIf you want to hold it for longterm and get it while it is sucking now, not a bad idea, but just know it will likely not start to do well at least until it rebalances next time.\n\nOn the other hand, SCHD and VOO are now running about the same total return for the past 3, 5 and 10 years, while taking different paths to that performance so if you like them both, probably a good idea to have both, since they partly hedge each other.",

I would rather own Broadcom Monday morning than SCHD for instance.\n\nBasically, you buy SCHD now, you should be ahead in three years.  But if you buy AVGO (or whatever) now and switch over to SCHD when its underlying is more in tune with the times, you should do better in three years.  Maybe not, but anytime you are making choices you should look at not only what is a good choice but what might be a better choice.",

There are lots of higher dividend stocks that would not fit my idea of value stocks .

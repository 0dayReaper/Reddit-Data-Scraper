    "postText": "\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/softbank-says-unaware-of-sec-probe-into-securities-trading\n\nOn Wednesday, short seller research site PlainSite posted a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter revealing that the agency is investigating SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company and investing giant notorious for financing various unprofitable \u201ctechnology\u201d companies like WeWork, Uber, Compass, and Oyo.\n\nAaron Greenspan, founder of the Think Computer Foundation that runs Plainsite, filed a FOIA request in December 2020 for \"any investigative materials [from January 1, 2018 to the present] pertaining to the various SoftBank companies controlled by Masayoshi Son, specifically relating to SoftBank's trading of stocks and derivatives on those stocks.\"\n\nThis request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the \"Nasdaq whale.\u201d SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.\n\nThanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank\u2019s high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit\u2015named SB Northstar\u2015and its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.\n\nIn a January letter responding to Greenspan\u2019s initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records. Greenspan appealed the decision on March 9 and two weeks later received a letter saying that responsive records were identified, but they could not be released under legal provisions that cover ongoing investigations.\n\n\u201cWe have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing,\u201d the SEC letter stated.\n\nAccording to the letter, the SEC maintains that releasing the records \u201ccould cause harm to the active and ongoing enforcement proceedings because, among other things, individuals and entities of interest in the underlying investigation could fabricate evidence, influence witness testimony and/or destroy or alter certain documents,\u201d in addition to revealing cooperating witnesses and the general scope of the investigation.\n\nThe debatable merits of the SEC\u2019s denial aside, an investigation into Softbank may indicate that its risky trading strategy is catching up to the giant. SoftBank unwound its Nasdaq derivative positions by December 2020 after investors questioned its \"controversial strategy\" which could've lost the company billions more. The last look at SB Northstar's books at the end of September showed that it had bought about $17 billion worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4 billion in bets to prop up their prices.\n\nSoftBank did not immediately respond to Motherboard\u2019s request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.",

If they bought ATM options that would equate to a gigantic exposure to the market. The thing is that the options they bought we\u2019re considerably OTM which means that 3.4B worth of premium would buy them a whole lot more contracts and, consequently, an even bigger exposure to the market. That\u2019s the main problem. Many people involved in SB operations where getting uncomfortable with the risk they were taking in  because it was getting harder and harder to manage due to the sheer size of they\u2019re exposure. When they were finally ousted as the whale buying all those options, everyone dumped on them, but at the time I believe that they had already liquidated their positions. \n\nThe bet paid off. But that\u2019s only because people start to notice when there\u2019s large inflows into a stock/option and they start pilling in and making the price rise. \n\nIt\u2019s market manipulation nonetheless, because they made those bets with the sole intent of getting other people to join in on these stocks, making the price rise as more and more people join in",

If retail wasn\u2019t a big deal, why would they go to such great efforts to get retail to sell??\n Go over to the GME thread and look at the top post that has the image of Bloomberg terminal screen. Look at how many shares exist. Retail itself definitely owns over 100% of float.. what more would you need to believe retail is a huge player in this scenario?",

I don't see how *any* of them are going to achieve long term profitability.\n\nThey make their money in two ways:\n\n* 15% to 35% of order value from the restaurant\n\n* Delivery/service fees paid by the customer\n\nBoth of these are going lower with time.  Many states are legislating 15% caps on restaurant fees.  They are trying to pass these fees to the consumer while simultaneously racing to the bottom to compete against each other.\n\nOn the driver end, pay is becoming a major issue.  It used to be that about half the drivers would accept anything and the other half were the \"cherry pickers\" (only taking high tipping orders).  Add in surging gas prices and there is now a lack of drivers in many places.\n\nNow everyone is trying to cherry pick, and the existing cherry pickers (like me) are getting even pickier.  I only accept about 2%-7% of orders sent to me, depending on app.  Doordash is already reducing delivery distances in a lot of their markets because they can't get orders delivered.  I was delivering hour-late food on Uber tonight because they had no tip (Uber paid me 4x base pay to do it, which itself is unprofitable).\n\nI just don't see it.  But I could also be really biased here.  I see further consolidation in this industry post-covid.",

Market manipulation requires the deliberate attempt to impact the free flow of markets with the intent of moving a stock price up or down, there are some qualifiers for \u201csocial harm\u201d too. \n\nThe legalities can get pretty in the weeds pretty fast, so like a super high surface level one could say that if a bunch of people decide they think a stock is going to go up and they buy calls, forcing a MM to hedge out the exposure which pushes up the stock then that\u2019s just a result of market mechanics.  If a single or coordinated group of large buyers decides to purchase calls with the intent of driving the price up specifically because of said hedging then that\u2019s market manipulation.  I\u2019d assume it\u2019s going to be quite difficult to prove but we shall see. \n\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to read more there\u2019s some writings on the legal theory here, as a warning it does get fairly in the weeds. \nhttps://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2978&amp;context=articles\n\n\nThe thing is, since the legalities and case law are so undefined here it\u2019s tough to say what if anything would come of this, the closest thing I can think of is the JPM Silver case, but that\u2019s still significantly different.  Most cases of market manipulation are tied to materially false statements, and those that are tied to trades are usually in far less liquid markets/securities.  So I guess it\u2019ll be interesting to watch at the very least.",

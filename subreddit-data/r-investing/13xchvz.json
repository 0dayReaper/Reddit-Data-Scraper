Although - if you need to park cash for only a few months, there may be better ways to do so.\n\nFor example - if you need liquidity (ie you may need to withdraw the funds regularly or on a short term basis) - something like a money market mutual fund makes more sense.\n\nIf you know that you don't need to touch the cash for some period of time - you can also just buy the treasuries directly or use other fixed income products like brokered CDs.\n\nThe choice of using SGOV vs something else really depends on your goal and need to access that 70k you mentioned.",

We already have a 529 Plan in place, and have been making monthly contributions for some time. Due to a death in the family, we have received a lump sum that would cover at least one year of college expenses. Rather than placing in the 529 account, I'm wondering if there are better investment options for the money, since it would only be in the account for the next 3-6 years as we cover college expenses. I would certainly appreciate any advice.",

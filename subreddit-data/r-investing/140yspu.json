    "postText": "Hi. I think I understand the specifics of a Roth back door    I make too much money to contribute to an Roth IRA.  If I contribute to a traditional IRA it would be non-deductible.  So looking at back door Roth.  I do have a current traditional IRA that has about $20k in it, it was a 401k rollover from a previous employer.   My question is about pro rata taxes.  Would those apply in this situation?   If so, how much would it be or how could i figure?  Basically is doing a back door worth it?  Thanks.",

            "comment": "Yes, you would be subject to pro-rata taxes. As you know, the way the backdoor Roth works, you put post-tax non-deductible dollars into your traditional IRA, and then convert that IRA money over to a Roth. When you convert a Trad IRA into a Roth, you need to pay taxes on any pre-tax dollars that get converted over. Ideally, all the money you convert over to the Roth is already post-tax, so that means you don't have to pay any extra taxes.\n\nThe problem is, if you already have pre-tax money in your traditional IRA (and mind you, they count all the trad IRAs you have, not just the one you put money into), the IRS doesn't let you just convert the post-tax money you put in. Once you put the money in, it essentially gets mixed in with all the other money already there (think like if you poured a glass of apple juice into a glass of orange juice). So when you do the Roth conversion, whatever proportion of your total account is pre-tax will be considered taxable (ie, since you have $20k pre-tax, if you do a $6500 nondeductible contribution, 20,000/26,500, about 75%, will be subject to pro-rata income tax when you do the Roth conversion).\n\nFor some reason, the pro-rata rule does not apply to 401ks. So one thing you can do, if you have an active 401k, is check to see if your plan will allow you to roll a traditional IRA into. Some plans do (you might have to call your plan provider to find out). If they do, you can get rid of your traditional IRA by sticking into your 401k. Then you can do backdoor Roth conversions free and clear.",

            "comment": "Yes the $20,000 Rollover IRA will count in the pro rata rule.\n\nBetween the $20,000 and the $6,500 nondeductible contribution you have $26,500. So 24.5% of your IRA is post tax money (6,500 / 26,500), and 75.5% of your IRA is pretax money (20,000 / 26,500).\n\nSo 75.5% of the $6,500 conversion (about $4905) will be taxable. And you'll need to file IRS form 8606 to track your basis in the Trad IRA space.\n\nIf you can rollover the IRA back into a 401k, you should do so, which would avoid the pro rata trigger.",

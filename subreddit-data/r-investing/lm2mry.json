    "postText": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/blackrock-has-started-to-dabble-in-bitcoin-says-rick-rieder.html\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Rick Rieder told CNBC on Wednesday the world\u2019s largest asset manager has begun entering the bitcoin space.\n\nThe remarks from Rieder, who is BlackRock\u2019s chief investment officer of global fixed income, came on the same day bitcoin broke above $51,000 for the first time.\n\n\u201cToday the volatility of it is extraordinary, but listen, people are looking for storehouses of value,\u201d Rieder said on \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d \u201cPeople are looking for places that could appreciate under the assumption that inflation moves higher and that debts are building, so we\u2019ve started to dabble a bit into it.\u201d\n\nIn January, BlackRock added bitcoin futures as an potential investment for two of its funds, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The funds are BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities and BlackRock Global Allocation Fund.\n\nA number of other financial institutions, such as BNY Mellon and Mastercard, have made entrances into the crypto space in recent days. BNY Mellon, the nation\u2019s oldest bank, will launch a digital assets unit later this year, while Mastercard intends to support certain cryptocurrencies on its formal network.\n\nElectric vehicle maker Tesla also announced last week it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin using cash on its balance sheet and intends to begin accepting the digital coin as payment for its products.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has risen more than 70% this year, adding to a major rally that began in the fall. \u201cMy sense is the technology has evolved and the regulation has evolved to the point where a number of people find it should be part of the portfolio, so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the price up,\u201d Rieder said.\n\nDespite bitcoin\u2019s growing respectability as an asset class, Rieder said Wednesday that how much exposure an investor should have \u201cdepends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re holding a lot more cash than we\u2019ve held historically,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because duration doesn\u2019t work, interest rates don\u2019t work as a hedge and so diversifying into other assets makes some sense. Holding some portion of what you hold in cash in things like crypto seems to make some sense to me, but I wouldn\u2019t espouse a certain allocation or target holding.\u201d",

I got into QBTC just to be done with the decision with a small percentage of my portfolio (aka gambling money).\n\nKids in r/bitcoin are super hyped about the money of the future and the death of centralized banking.  I'm not, not at all.\n\nIn fact, I could imagine a world when authorities straight up ban cryptos.  The more it becomes mass adoption, regulations (direct or indirect) will kick in.  Smart money cannot be in love with cryptos where Trillions aren't flowing in the normal market.\n\nThose big firms jumping in the train is also a double edged sword.  Very good short term for the price, then later on you realize they are able to manipulate the price somehow and profit from it leaving retail on the side, once again.\n\nDeep inside of me I still consider BTC gambling and I'm just trying to scoop easy profits and/or assume a small loss or anemic returns for years. If in 15 years from now everyone is having BTC and it's somewhat of a norm and I didn't hold, I just don't care.  I was wrong, like so many other times before.",

You don't need an app. You can just go to webpages and if the webpages are blocked in one jurisdiction, you just use a proxy. \n\nThe hardest thing is figuring out how to onboard fiat in a regulatory environment where it is banned. But there are definitely ways to go about it. No doubt prices would take a hit if it were banned by say the US (although I think that's highly unlikely). \n\nI believe in the future of decentralized finance. Centralized finance has certain advantage but it's also so corrupt and unequal. We need something new. Most of my crypto assets are in eth and DeFi tokens...I have some btc but btc is increasingly dominated and controlled by wealthy people and institutions and it's not that decentralized. I mean I still only allocate a portion of my money into crypto although I wish I had put way more back when I got involved in 2016. Oh well.\n\nThere's always going to be people like me who believe in it and will participate in it and facilitate it regardless of regulatory status. The more casual people might leave but it's really not going anywhere. And I highly doubt it would be banned anyway.",

A CBDC can still be debased, it can still be seized and a CBDC can and will likely have inbuild controls that determine where and how you can spend it/transact it. It's basically fiat money with inbuild monitoring and control. Very useful for governments and central banks, but could get orwellian pretty fast. In many ways it's the antithesis of \"true\" cryptocurrencies. I suspect that the possibly slightly orwellian nature of CBDC's could even drive further adoption of crypto, but who knows",

Most likely not because you know the value of 1 BTC is $50,000, and the cup of coffee is only $2. That's the thing in people's minds nowadays. BTC is valuable because of USD. Without the actual currency, BTC has no intrinsic value whatsoever. At the end, it's still pegged against the actual currency. It's practically a derivative currency.\n\nNow this thing is global and people are adopting it, which is what scares me the most. What's preventing a group of people to do massive selloffs, crashing the value down, took assets away from the banks, funds, and other people's pension funds. This thing is scary.",

Kraken received a banking license last year, and is one of the oldest XMR&lt;--\\&gt;fiat pairs. Also, the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (lead regulator for US Banks), released guidance a few weeks ago specifying that *all* blockchains, including those with enhanced AML risks, are permissble for banks to use. Finally, watching the primary concerns of central banks regarding CBDCs, privacy is basically one of their #1 concerns.\n\nOverall, I think that it's moreso the chain analysis, exchanges, and miner corporations that have been trying to suppress Monero. Obviously XMR largely invalidates chain analysis business model, but moreover, Monero took great pains to ensure that ASIC miners weren't able to scoop up the majority of new issuance at launch. So the miners and exchanges don't have large amounts to dump on retail at market tops, so they're not really promoting it.\n\nBut despite all this, Monero is continually exhibiting signs of organic adoption and growth. It's an uphill battle, but one I think will be fruitful.",

The divisibility of the coins is actually a plus: if the service is roughly pegged to a fixed value, and the coin doubles in USD price, then the service will cost half as many coins. So the utility of the service is unaffected by coin price, allowing supply and demand to adjust the coin price without affecting the utility of the network. So early on the service might cost 1000 coins, but as the project matures that same service might cost 100, then 10, and eventually 0.001 while still compensating everyone involved in the service provision appropriately.\n\nIf you are really curious, here is a summary of LTOs token model https://blog.ltonetwork.com/deflationary-asset-burning-defi-model/\n\nAnd here is a summary  of TRAC's: https://origintrailexplained.info/#trac\n\nIf you are AT ALL curious about how this works in practice I highly recommend taking a day or two to read up on the whole crypto ecosystem. There are massive gains to be made by being able to find legit projects early on and then just sitting back and watching the money pile up. I am up 10x on my initial investment, and I have banked my tokens in such a way that I am getting 7% APY paid out in additional tokens from network fees from paying customers who are actively using the network.",

The idea of \"get in or lose out\" is a pernicious one and I wonder how many CFOs and other people are looking at that and seeing $$$. \n\nBut one thing to note is that BTC is an incredibly risky investment and as the article states, people have cash to burn and therefore can take the risk. So please do not take out a second mortgage. If you have money to lose, diversifying a bit into crypto makes sense.",

Suspiciously they don't explain any of that on their website, they only state they follow TradeBlock XBX Index, but\n\n&gt;Grayscale Bitcoin Trust does **not currently operate a redemption program** and may halt creations from time to time. **There can be no assurance that the value of the shares will approximate the value of the Bitcoin held by the Trust** and the shares may trade at a substantial premium over or discount to the value of the Trust's Bitcoin.\n\nPersonally I find it amusing that folks are now using legacy brokers and finance institutions to pour billions into an asset that was created with the sole idea of circumventing those institutions and giving power back to the people. And the reason why it's seen as a hedge by many is directly linked to the fact that unlike in traditional markets there is actually accountability for each \"share\", the owner has full control at all times and can verify everything, and there isn't any risk of runaway inflation or over-leveraged banks that can take you down. It's rather absurd to be buying into this, but using a bank to do so. Hardware wallets are only a few bucks.",

I got tagged so if you want to know what that person was talking about I made an FAQ [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/hc3uto/ethe_gbtc_grayscale_frequently_asked_questions/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).\n\nIt\u2019s a little dated with the ratios and premiums but the fundamental points still stand. Btw, it is actually explained in their reports in detail, my FAQ hits on some of the quotes (or at least how to find the report). \n\nShort and sweet, there is an amount of BTC or ETH backing of up each share of GBTC or ETHE. It\u2019s a ratio that changes slightly each day, but that is on their main webpage for each product.\n\nWhen issued, it\u2019s at NAV. However when it hits the secondary market it is priced per market forces. As you noted, no redemptions... so that\u2019s part of why the price doesn\u2019t track particularly well (and the 6 month wait). \n\nThe irony isn\u2019t lost on me, but Grayscale is running everything per SEC laws and it is a nice way to get crypto exposure in an IRA. Premium moves wildly (although tame as of late), some call it an issue but if you game it right it\u2019s actually a nice little boost to your gains.",

Right now, only financial news outlets are really talking about this rally but most non mainstream news outlets are too busy with Covid, Politics, and Weather at the moment to fit Bitcoin into the news cycle. \n\nAlso, this rally is being clearly being fueled by institutions whereas 2017s run was mostly, looking from the outside in, retail which makes me believe that this rally will be more sustainable as institutions would not let an asset they are invested in have the massive crashes like it has done before. Will we still see \\~50% drops, probably, but really doubt it'll crash more than that unless we somehow go vertical once again which imo would be 250,000 or more in 2021. Then I could see a drop to 50k, but once again, I highly doubt institutions would let bitcoin rise that high that fast ever again.\n\nEdit: how I plan to determine if we're near the top is if I see a new article on bitcoin reach the front page of my local news network for a couple days or it is featured in the non financial section of the broadcast explaining what is crypto and bitcoin, with a headline of something along the lines of \"Bitcoin Craze\" or something like that",

But just addressing the current digital currency (Visa) vs Bitcoin (layer 1 settlement) Bitcoin is still faster than visa and actually safer for the merchant than visa. If I sent you Bitcoin you would see it in your wallet almost immediately. Just like if I swiped a card. The difference is, Bitcoin needs \"confirmations\" to be considered final, and after 3 the transaction is considered final. Whereas visa is not considered final for 72 days or whatever the call back refund period is for said credit cards. But they control the system so they can pull the money back for any reason, yours or theirs. So in this ONE scenario, Bitcoin wins.\n \nI would also recommend looking up the lightning network (layer 2 protocol) which addresses high fees and settlement time. \n\nSpoiler alert: fees are less than a penny, and settlement is as fast as your internet. So 2 second delay tops, usually.",

    "postText": "\nHi! So I\u2019m 21 and have just hit 15k in savings. I\u2019m very proud of myself for saving that much money, but I\u2019m not sure how to move forward with it. I have my money in a Student Savings account. I\u2019m not sure if or how I should begin investing my money, or if I should move it to a different kind of savings account. And my parents don\u2019t really have any great financial advice. Any info or suggestions would be helpful!",

            "comment": "You're going to get a lot of advice. But probably the most important thing that you can understand is 15k in savings =/= 15k to invest.\n\nMortgages are about 7%. Credit cards about 20%. Treasuries are paying about 5.\n\nSo, best thing you can do is maintain strict savings milestones.\n\n1) Save $1000. This is untouchable unless there is an extreme emergency.\n\n2) Get insurance. Save enough to cover insurance deductibles. \n\n3) Save six months expenses\n\n4) pay off loans or invest\n\nYou are 21, riskier investments are ok as long as you have your month to month expenses covered. Take this time to learn how different investment vehicles work. Try things out with small amounts of money. Once you find something that is good for your situation you can consider chipping in more.",

                    "comment": "&gt; Get insurance.\n\nThat's too generic a statement to be useful.  What -kind- of insurance should a 21yo have?\n\nGuideline: Buy insurance to cover the cost of something you **can't** or **don't want to** afford by yourself.\n\n* Life insurance?  Probably not; if OP eventually has a mortgage to pay off or a kid to put through college, and their CURRENT INCOME is required to so, then life ins to replace that income makes sense -- eventually.\n* Health insurance? Probably.\n* Liability insurance? Maybe.  Some of this is included in:\n* Auto Insurance? Absolutely!\n* Disability insurance? Hard to say.\n* Long-term-care insurance?  Absolutely Not.\n* Insurance as an investment vehicle?  *Run away!!*\n* Drug insurance?  etc, etc,\n\nBut just telling a young person to \"get insurance\" is not really helpful guidance.",

If you have a longer investment horizon and are comfortable with taking on more risk, you may want to consider investing in a diversified portfolio of U.S. equities. However, if you have a shorter investment horizon or are risk-averse, you may want to consider a high-yield savings account or a CD. It's important to remember to always do your due diligence and consult with a licensed financial advisor before making any investment decisions.",

Pls help!\n\nIm imaging my mortgage being sold on the secondary mortgage market to another firm for repackaging into an MBS. \n\nIm imaging the value of a low interest rate mortgage in an economy where interest rates have been hiked, does the value of the mortgage go down like a bond does?\n\nWhat decided the price of the mortgage?\nCould it be less the the remainder of the principle due on the loan? \nOr would it be valued higher due to the estimated sum of the interest expected to be paid; higher but less then the calculated sum?\n\nIm trying to ask if i can take advantage of the interest rate hikes devaluing low interest mortgage assets. \n\nCan I buy my mortgage, for less than the calculated total repayments I would have paid if i kept the loan for the life of the mortgage, and cancel out my debt obligation and save money?",

You can actually hold your own mortgage debt however it's generally not useful to most people because there are better gains to be made.\n\nYou can self fund your mortgage for a fee to a chartered bank.   I think it's $200 a year.\n\nThis works well for registered accounts where the holder has maximized their contribution room and wants to get more funds into a registered account.    \n\nBecause interest earned is fully taxable as compared to capital gains there is little reason to hold in a non registered account.  \n\n100% though you are allowed to own your own mortgage debt.   The reasons for doing so generally are limited.    You can get similar or better returns investing through private equity MIC.\n\nBut no, you can't just write it off.  The debt is still with a chartered bank.",

Unfortunately, the answer is no: it's not profitable for banks to sell individual mortgages, and if they sell them at all for a loss, they do a bunch at once.\n\nBut some places have formalized this and they give you the right to buy your mortgage back:\n\n&gt;In Denmark, in addition to pre-paying your mortgage when interest rates fall and you refi, you also have the right to 'buy' your mortgage out of the CMO bond when interest rates rise and the street price of the bond falls. The price you pay is whatever percentage your mortgage is of the total par value of the bond.\n\n&gt;So if you have a $500K mortgage that is in a $50M par value 3% bond and the street price of the bond drops to $41M, you can \"buy' your individual mortgage out of the pool for ($500k/$50M) \\* $41M = $410K\n\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32813598",

Why?\n\nSay that your mortgage was recently resold on the market, either by itself or as part of a package of similar mortgages. To the buyer, they are getting your future mortgage payments in exchange for some upfront price $X. But that $X that they paid is *not the face value of your mortgage*. Given that interest rates have risen, they have no reason to pay the full face value. They are going to pay some lower rate, so that the payments they receive are commensurate with current interest rates. That means $X will be lower than your mortgage's value.\n\nThe new owner has no reason to take a further discount from you on $X - not when they could just re-sell it on the market for $X.\n\nYou're trying to take advantage of a loss in value, but that loss in value has already happened, and it affected whoever bought or funded your mortgage on the wrong side of the interest rate changes. It's too late for you to take advantage of that.",

            "comment": "It's an intriguing concept, but buying your own mortgage directly is not typically possible for the average homeowner. Here's why:\r  \n\r  \n**Mortgages are packaged and sold in groups:** When your mortgage is sold, it is typically bundled with many other mortgages into a mortgage-backed security (MBS). An individual typically cannot buy a single mortgage out of this pool.\r  \n\r  \n**Secondary market transactions are complex and large-scale:** Buying a mortgage or a mortgage-backed security requires a significant amount of capital and knowledge about the mortgage industry. These transactions are typically done by large financial institutions, not individuals.\r  \n\r  \n**Pricing of Mortgages:** Mortgage pricing in the secondary market takes into account the present value of the future cash flows, which includes both principal and interest payments. These calculations are based on various factors such as current interest rates, the creditworthiness of the borrowers, and the anticipated rate of prepayment. If interest rates rise, the value of a low-interest mortgage might decrease (similar to how a bond works), but it's not guaranteed that the value would fall below the outstanding balance of the mortgage.\r  \n\r  \n**Regulatory issues:** There are likely to be numerous legal and regulatory issues with an individual buying their own mortgage. Mortgages and mortgage-backed securities are highly regulated products, and it's unlikely that a typical homeowner would be able to navigate these complexities.\r  \n\r  \nThat being said, homeowners do have an option to take advantage of low interest rates: refinancing. When you refinance your mortgage, you essentially pay off your old loan by taking out a new loan, typically with a lower interest rate. This could lead to significant savings over the life of your mortgage.\r  \n\r  \nIn an environment where rates are rising, refinancing might not seem as attractive, but there can still be reasons to do it, such as switching from an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate mortgage, or cashing out home equity.",

    "postText": "I have 25k of student loans at 31 years old.. The loans range from 3-5 percent unsubsidized interest. I have 185k total in savings and investment atm. I am debating on whether I want to pay it all at once or just pay it down slowly. My original plan was to pay it all at once when the forebearance ends, but smart money tells me to just pay minimum. Now I am confused on what to do.What would your advice be? if pay it off slowly how much should i put in a month.",

            "comment": "I would pay at least the 5% ones off, once forbearance ends and once the government finalizes what will happen with student loan forgiveness. It would be super dumb to pay off during forbearance, and it would also be pretty crazy to pay off debt when the government might reduce your balance by 10k. \n\nI disagree with many of the other commenters. \"Enjoying life\" or \"Not having a ball and chain\" or paying them off just to not have debt are not valid / objectively good reasons unless you're financially at a point where money has ceased to matter at all. \n\nYou should pay off 5% student loans because it's hard to meet those returns, and impossible to meet it in a guaranteed fashion. You can do HYSA for 4% but you'll pay tax on the interest. You can invest and get 8% inflation-adjusted returns, but it's not guaranteed, you'd have to think long-term, and you'd have to pay taxes on the returns anyways. \n\nPaying off 5% debt means you get 100% guaranteed 5% returns with no tax liability. \n\nBut again, for sure hold off until forbearance ends and the forgiveness is determined.",

I'd note that the funds that don't go towards paying off lower interest rate debt could be invested now either in HYSA as others have mentioned or in high dividend stocks where qualified dividends get preferential tax rates.  $MO for example yields nearly 8.5% today as an example. Qualified dividend tax rates depend on your tax bracket and come after a reasonable holding period but are attractive for many.  One could potentially even just use some of the dividend income to pay down the low interest debt cover time (with a focus on the peace of mind of eliminating old debt).\n\n**Qualified dividend tax rates**\n\n* In the 10% or 12% tax bracket, your qualified dividends are taxed at 0%,\n* In the 22%, 24%, 32%, or 35% tax bracket, your qualified dividends are taxed at 15%, and\n* In the 37% tax bracket, your qualified dividends are taxed at 20%\n\nSource: https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/income/investments/dividend-taxes/#:\\~:text=Qualified%20dividends%20are%20taxed%20at,are%20taxed%20at%2015%25%2C%20and",

However one way to picture it is to ask yourself if you\u2019d take out a loan today at 3-5% to invest the money for the chance of those long term returns.",

I had $100k invested in 2008 and asked myself whether I should keep investing or pay off my $100k in student loan debt.  A few months later, my portfolio was worth $30k.  It took me two years to recover and by then, life circumstances had changed, so it took me 3 years after that to get my debt paid.  We have an inverse rate yield curve that almost always means recession is imminent.  Pay off the student loan and get it out of your life.",

            "comment": "It really depends on certain things . If the payments can be made while you invest in certain things sure . Can the investment make 6% + to validate the debt? My personal advice would be to pay the 25k , not because the interest is low , but because the debt being paid off &gt; the investment making you a lot of money short term . Even long term , at 10% you would make 2500 on the first year . If it was 250k makes sense . Or the other option is get a whole life policy against it to help you generate wealth over time and help you for the future in 2 ways , 1 ) you can put the loan on it to pay it off just incase something happens to you and 2) after 4 years the savings component comes into play and create wealth to generate till year 20 . After that you will still create wealth as it grows and if you ever need to borrow against  the policy its a tax free way to do so . I know its a lot , but as long as you have options , we have answers . As for tax purposes and such please ask someone around your area due to canada and usa have different tax codes and such. But this part is pretty equivalent. Benefits of the li policy can be used to get you higher loan as well for housing and such . ( also check with your laws in usa as i am an advisor in Canada)",

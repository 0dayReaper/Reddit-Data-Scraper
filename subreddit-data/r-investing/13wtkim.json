    "postText": "Hi folks, I can't seem to find reliable clear insight into American Depository Receipts (ADRs) vs. owning the shares in your brokerage via a foreign exchange.\n\nFor example, I own some ADRs that are very low liquidity, and I am interested in just buying the stock via my brokerage to hold. What I'm trying to figure out is what's the overall thing to look out for when it comes to Currency differences, ADRs in USD vs. Foreign stocks in Yen or the Pound for example. I've also heard that ADRs charge a maintenance fee, but I don't know where to find that info.\n\nKind Regards!",

            "comment": "It might help if you post the ADR as they are not all the same. Some ADRs are officially \"sponsored\" by the company to allow people in the USA to more easily invest in them, they work with an investment bank to setup the ADR\n\nSome are un-official where some bank will just set it up independent of the company . Usually with sponsored ADRs the company will pay the fees associated with the setup\n\nHowever usually its just easier to buy the ADR because you do not have to get access to the foreign exchange to buy, convert you dollars to the foreign currency and dividends automatically get converted back to USD",

    "postText": "I have been thinking about reading security analysis lately, but just now I saw that it was a 700 page book. I read the intelligent investor in the past, which I thought was an okay read (made sense, but took a while to get through). \n\nIs Security analysis written in a similar style to the intelligent investor? Is it difficult to comprehend the message conveyed by the authors?\n\nI really don't want to spend $50-60 on a book I won't finish, so I appreciate responses from those of you here who have read the book before.",

            "comment": "It's a fairly low return for each unit of time invested in reading it. There are probably more modern books that would give more relevant and up to date information.\n\nI listened to the audiobook which let me use it to fill commute time. You won't become a genius investor from it but for me it reinforced important concepts and helped me understand the original idea of value investing. If you can look past the railroad bonds, outdated ratios and long defunct companies to get the overall idea it's an interesting, enjoyable, and very long book. I think the most valuable things I got from are was differentiating between investment, speculation, and gambling and getting a better sense for when a market or stock is way too hyped up or unfairly undervalued.",

            "comment": "I enjoyed it. It doesn\u2019t offer much in terms of strategies that are widely applicable today, if only because it\u2019s been many decades since it was written. However, the overall mindset is still very applicable.\n\nSome points I found particularly interesting include:\n* Beware companies that are growing rapidly but only through acquisitions\n\n* Pay extra close attention to \u201cspecial items\u201c in cash flows and balance sheets.\n\n* If a company has multiple shared classes, look for arbitrage opportunities\n\n* If you want to invest in a company, consider the relative strength of its bonds versus its equity\n\nIt takes a little bit of personal creativity to apply this stuff, you\u2019re not going to get a curated list of strategies and analysis teams to perform today. However, if you read it carefully enough to understand Graham\u2018s thought process, do you find that there\u2019s lots of inspiration to be drawn from it.",

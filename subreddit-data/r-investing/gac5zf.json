    "postText": "I have browsed this sub for the better part of the last decade and picked up a lot of useful tips and information. The last few weeks - it seems like it has become the norm to toss best practices of investing out the window.\n\n\nI learned the following on here: \n\nYou can not time the markets. It is impossible. The market is irrational. Keep your money in and keep investing. Time is your friend. The market will go up over long periods of time.\n\nAnd now in 2020 I am seeing the following advice being pushed:\n\nI know better than the markets. The markets will drop. I can surely time this. It\u2019s not me that\u2019s wrong it\u2019s the market. The market is not responding correctly to bad news.\n\nI am even seeing people over emphasize negative news stories about the virus or the economy. It seems there is a growing resentment from people holding cash that may have missed catching a falling knife - which we always knew to be incredibly difficult.\n\nThe fact of the matter is we don\u2019t know how the market will behave. For us average investors it is best to keep putting money in and holding or dollar cost averaging. Ignore everything else.",

If you wouldn't buy a stock at its current price, why would you continue to hold that stock at that price?\n\nnow i'm not saying this is the endtimes for the US economy and stock market. I absolutely believe, fundamentally, that our economy will truly recover and we will hit ATHs again, sooner rather than later. but just like 2008, I think some companies will survive and others will die, and holdings in certain companies aren't worth holding through the uncertainty. If you're a total market index investor (like a lot of us), then absolutely just hold through. Loss is just a cheap time to buy. but holding some specific securities through this is probably more risk than is worth.",

The fear I have is that this may be the long term debt cycle (75 year avg) deleveraging which could have peaked in 2008. When the debt-income ratio rises, lowering the interest rate stops working, the debt repayments become larger than incomes, the economy will deleverage. Less spending leads to less income to less wealth to less credit leads to less spending and the cycle repeats. In a recession, lowering interest rates will increase spending and break the cycle. The only way out is to cut spending, reduce debt through defaults and restructurings, redistribute wealth and print money. The fed's actions appear as if they're preparing for a depression and it wouldn't be all that hard to believe from the fiscal irresponsibility leading to the 08 crash and the complete lack of reform since then. IF we are truly heading towards a depression, it would be understandable to avoid the market because it will take decades to recover.",

                            "comment": "The problem isn't really that the bears are wrong. They are almost surely correct, because the fundamentals dictate so. Reality dictates so.\n\nHowever, what they bears are *really* discussing is economics, not investing. The difference is that economics is not nearly as concerned with time horizon, and thus, it is usually foolish to make *investment* decisions (which tend to be much more sensitive to time) based on *economic* analysis. (EDIT: Additionally, economics is almost entirely unconcerned with, and generally makes no indication of, how an individual should make decisions. It is instead concerned with assessing the future and present based on the result of the decisions which *are* made in the current existing circumstances.)\n\nThey are 100% related, and the market will eventually, no matter who is doing what, be subject to the reality of the economy. That is just a fact, (and it is the fact that bears are crying about now). But when you *change* your investment (from cash to assets, or assets to cash) you are *intensely* affected by the specific timing. Economics says very little about specific timing, it is concerned about broad trends and broad markets over broad periods... especially macroeconomics which are primarily the type of economics that are being debated back and forth.\n\nThe disservice is that the people arguing against the bears are telling them they are wrong about the *facts*. They are not. The virus and the measures the global economy has taken will 100% without a doubt cause a much larger problem in the economy and the markets.\n\nBut even during the worst economic situations, *some* markets are strong, and *some* businesses are strong. There are absolutely businesses, and thus individual stocks, whose fundamentals in this situation actually indicate a good deal. A bear market isn't everyone being losers, it's that there are more losers than winners by aggregate invested capital. That doesn't mean that all capital is underperforming.\n\nWhat needs to be explained to the bears, and no one seems to be doing, is not that they are *wrong*. It's that their analysis doesn't lead to any actionable information. \n\nSo you say that this will lead to a huge rise in foreclosures, maybe even more than the 2008 financial crisis? That could definitely be true. It will almost definitely lead to an increase in foreclosures. How do you take advantage of that? By having enough cash to purchase a foreclosed property at auction sometime in the next 5-10 years.\n\nSo you say that this will lead to a 40-60% drop from peak in the S&amp;P 500? That could also definitely be true. How do you take advantage of that? Probably by selling LEAP calls, not by purchasing puts that expire next month or next week. But if you look at what you can actually sell those for, (we'll assume a spread because we're not stupid enough to sell naked LEAPs), you could sell the June 2021 300/305 call spread on SPY for ~$210 per contract, with a capital requirement of $500. But there's a lot of risk in that, for contract that you're risking $1.38 for ever $1 of potential profit on. There's early assignment risk, which is MUCH worse on LEAPs. There's the risk that the Fed uses monetary policy to transform the downturn into an inflationary one instead, which would result in the market going up while real purchasing power goes down.\n\nWhat about purchasing a LEAP put instead? Well, the June 2021 250 put will cost you ~$1,860 today, and it still isn't protected from the risk of an inflationary recession. (In fact, it performs even worse in such a case.)\n\nOr what if the downturn does come, but governments around the world are able to use measures that are bad in the long term to defer it? What if that doesn't happen for about another year? Sure, the *10 year* prospect would get even worse, but exactly what instrument are you going to use to bet that the market goes down over a period of 10 years in real terms instead of nominal terms?\n\nThe bears are 100% right. Unfortunately, there's not much they, or anyone else, can do about it. This whole thing is a shit situation. It's shit for us investors regardless of the market, it's shit for families, it's shit for politicians who are stuck with nothing but options that will be unpopular, it's shit for the working class who are probably going to be totally fucked by a combination of the economy (which much more directly affects employment than markets) and automation or other efficiency improvements.\n\nWhat the bears need to be told is this:\n\nYes, you're right, the economy is kinda fucked. Unfortunately, none of those things that you think let you profit off a fucked economy are likely to work, so you're probably going to have to deal with a fucked economy *and* bad investments if you try. This isn't really because markets are inherently dishonest, it's that most markets measure the value of capital, not the value of the economy itself.\n\nThe only real tool to bet against an entire economy is to short the currency that economy uses or use commodity futures, but unfortunately since most governments have the power to directly affect and control their currency, that isn't guaranteed either, and it's pretty difficult to do that if it's the same currency you earn money in. Additionally, commodity futures may not be available or priced attractively on the timescales that you might be right about the economy on, and they can be affected in the short term by speculative demand based on inflationary concerns as well.\n\nThe only truly well-positioned people for this kind of situation are those whole have enormous amounts of capital to expand a business they own and are able to rapidly adapt to industry changes that allow them to get enormous return in volatile economic circumstances while also being connected enough to the people who control the actual power over currency, etc. to be able to accurately assess such risk.\n\nNone of us are those people, so none of those options are available to us.\n\nEvery retail investor is going to be fucked by this somehow, and you won't be any different just because you see it coming.\n\nEDIT: \n\nAnd for those who doubt the idea of an inflationary crash, it's basically the only way that a government can maximally protect the rich, and the only thing they have to do is fuck the poor and middle class in a way that the poor and middle class don't even really understand. I can't really be confident about *any* politician rejecting that idea, given history and how our societies are constructed.\n\nAnd hedges against inflation, such as gold, don't necessarily protect you from economic component of a \"crash\", just the inflation side.\n\nThe \"real\" way to \"win\" is to pick the business that is going to come out ahead 1-2 years from now. The reason this is foolishness for us retail investors, and a golden ticket for most of the extremely wealthy, is that most of the wealthy have (at least some) control over how the business tries to come out ahead 1-2 years from now, either from being an executive, or from being a large investor that the company consults/keeps appraised. Thus they are not nearly as exposed to the mistakes of others, and are more reliant on their own mistakes or brilliance.",

So each month, you put in 1/18.\n\nOn the other hand, periodic investing is how most of us invest in our 401ks. You invest everything you have available when you get it, periodically, which isn't DCAing because you aren't splitting a lump sum up into multiple installments.",

You'd do worst if you invested at the peak and never again.\n- \"I'm DCA'ing with a bigger amount into the dip, but I'm not timing the market.\" Uhh what?? Go for it, I don't really care, but if you can DCA harder now, you weren't fully invested before, so you're timing the market.",

You can absolutely re-balance a portfolio during a down period without it falling into \"timing the market\"",

It's an index of 500 large companies.  If the COVID shutdowns force a lot of independent coffee shops out of business, those losses aren't reflected in the S&amp;P 500.  Starbucks, however, is reflected, and if they've got the cash to weather the storm, they'll be in a pretty good spot on the other side taking business away from the independent shops.  As a result, the economy could be in complete shambles, but if big companies benefit from the small business closures, the S&amp;P 500 could still increase.",

Idea generation about what to buy? Not really, instead thread after thread of, \"Is ThIs A BuLl TrAp?\" People complaining about the Fed, which 1) is a waste of time and 2) provides absolutely nothing useful. Okay, you're all upset about the Fed - how are you going to invest? If you're not going to invest, then what are you doing here? A Fed member is not going to come here and go \"Oh, user 42069lovesweed is upset about what we are doing and would prefer if we let everything crater so that they can be right about their negative view. Lets stop everything.\"\n\nI'm still seeing people who are genuinely (and bizarrely) upset when optimistic things are mentioned, although it has started to calm down a little. And remember, when this sub is very pessimistic (like in mid March) time to buy. When this sub gets much less pessimistic, that's time to get concerned.\n\n\"It\u2019s not me that\u2019s wrong it\u2019s the market.\"\n\nStarted to see \"the market isn't doing what I think it should\" a lot in 2019.

When the market goes in the complete opposite direction of where fundamentals are pointing with no sign of stopping, it is a concerning trend. People can lose trust in the markets. You don't have to time the markets down to the hour, but what is the point in having a market if it doesn't reflect the value of the companies participating? It is healthy for a market to experience downturns.",

One part of the frustration is clearly missing out on a \"buying opportunity\", the other one is that everything you thought you knew is being thrown out of the window. A pandemic causes the whole world to close down, a massive amount of businesses goes bankrupt and millions of people lose their jobs. To the market that event seems to have been a tiny speed bump at best. Based on that you can almost make the argument that it's pointless for markets to ever go down, which is I think is psychologically difficult for people in general. We like the feeling of control, or at least the illusion of it.",

The whole economy is in limbo, about to reopen against the advice of epidemiologists and scientists. Medical workers still wildly short on PPE and not ready for a mass influx of COVID patients. Economists are predicting an extended and severe recession. Unemployment is hitting numbers not seen since the Depression. FOMO and overoptimism that the epidemiologists' predictions won't come true (and lead to a re-closure) seem to be driving most of the stock increases at this moment. \n\nWhen one balances upside vs. downside, it's easy to understand why people who were bulls a month ago purchasing good companies at good prices for long-term holds suddenly became bears when those prices quickly rose to near ATHs with no justifiable reason to rise so quickly. If this is a straight up V recovery with no bull trap, it will be a first.\n\nI took some profits and missed out on some further gains since then, but I have a sizeable amount of cash to take advantage if certain stocks fall or if the situation as a whole starts to get bad again - at least I know I won't be riding the whole thing back down again. In the meantime, I'm DCAing and patiently watching to see which stocks hit my target prices.",

            "comment": "People like to think of investing in terms of hindsight: will I look back on this decision and decide that it was the right one, given the direction the market goes in.\n\nMy perspective as someone who has largely checked out of the market, and is not an expert at ANY of this stuff, is this:\n\n1. Risk is high.  Very high.  You can look around and see entire industries shutting down, of people losing jobs by the millions, of massive economic turmoil around the world.  That's the _definition_ of a high-risk environment\n\n2. This risk is above my threshold.  I went through the 2008 economic crisis.  Just kept investing incrementally through it.  The current risk feels way higher than 2008.\n\n3. It's been a good 10 years of great returns for me.  2019 was really good, and I got solid growth.  When I checked out, I was down 10% from my ATH in 2019.  Averaged over the last decade, that's a great run.\n\n4. I feel like the next several months poses a risk to my employment prospects, so I feel like having cash on hand is a good thing.  Having things fluctuate in the market, worrying about whether it will drop soon or not, is not a worry I need right now.  Especially not when I'm stuck at home and kind of stressed out in general.\n\n5. I'm OK if I miss out on some growth in the near term.  I've had the pleasure of enjoying solid growth for 10 years, and I was already going to shift conservative in 2020 before COVID took us by surprise.\n\n6. I'm more interested in capital preservation right now.  There are some bigger direct investments I've been wanting to make (like in land).. so I want cash around for that.\n\n7. The biggest risk I face right now is loss to inflation.  I have my money in a fixed-interest account for now.  If inflation goes through the roof, I feel that society has other problems that are bigger in magnitude that I'll need to deal with anyway.\n\nSo, I'm pretty content to have my money.\n\nI'm not a regular poster here, and I do post on WSB (but I don't play options.. I just enjoy the memes there).  If the investing sub's only purpose for existing is \"DCA, keep investing\", then there's really not much to talk about at all here, is there?\n\nYes, I appreciate that you're tired of the bears vs. bulls crap that has been dominating investment talk lately.  Everyone wants to understand what's going on and everyone likes predicting the future.\n\nI'm not going to predict the future - who the fuck knows if the Fed's actions are going to inflate stock value through the roof and keep things stable.  Who knows if they're going to fail.  Who knows if we're headed for new lows.. or a V-shape.  I don't pretend to know these things.\n\nBut I know risk is high, and I know things are bad, and this is a time when I feel is a good time to be conservative... at least for me.",

But I don't mind. I am already up more than I expected this year. The market made some sense to me earlier but it doesn't right now. So I feel like I am gambling more than anything. So it's okay to sit it our and regroup your thoughts. If your selling at a loss I get it, panic selling. But is it bad if I sell at my peak?   \n\n\nMy other hypothesis is that Canadian housing might go down a bit and I want to have a cash to invest if that is the case.

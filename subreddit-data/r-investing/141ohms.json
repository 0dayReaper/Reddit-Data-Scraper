Can somebody explain it to me like I'm 5?\n\nWill bond prices and  yields likely go up because of this? Or down? (Or prices down,  yields up,or vice versa,   or...?)\n\nWould it most likely be a better idea to buy bonds *before* or *after* this upcoming so-called deluge of bonds?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cOutside of a major crisis, like 2008 or 2020, this is going to be the largest issuance of T-bills on record,\u201d says Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities.\n\n[https://www.axios.com/2023/06/05/debt-ceiling-treasury-issuance](https://www.axios.com/2023/06/05/debt-ceiling-treasury-issuance)\n\nThank you",

T-Bill pricing isn\u2019t just (or even primarily) determined by nominal supply of actual t-bills. \n\nIt is also impacted by the \u201csupply\u201d of alternative sources of yield per unit of risk, interest rate policy, and a whole host of other things in global markets.\n\nFor example, if the Fed signaled they were going to change the long-term inflation target to 3-4% instead of 2-3% that\u2019s going to have such an overwhelming impact that an increase in nominal supply would be near irrelevant",

(Inverse relationship)\nThis means your logic to determine lower prices also imply higher yields, as simple as that.\n\nThe exact mechanism is kinda hard to explain in a post, so I\u2019d suggest a simple google search / Chat GPT to explore this relationship (kinda simple and intuitive).",

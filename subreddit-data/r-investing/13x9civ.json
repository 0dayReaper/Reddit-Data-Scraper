    "postText": "All,\n\nI was looking at BDCs such as Arcc and Main and noticed that they have negative operating cash flow and free cash flow for most years. This is mainly to due large amount of (-) non-cash items relative to their net income on their balance sheet.\n\nCan someone give a brief explanation if this is the norm for BDCs and why is it so?",

            "comment": "Just looking at ARCC, I do see a few non-cash items deducted from net income in their cash flow statement. These are primarily PIK interest income received on loans they've extended to their clients. PIK is a form of interest paid in kind (i.e., tacked onto the principal, only paid in cash at maturity). PIK interest would be recognised by ARCC as income in the P&amp;L, but excluded from the cash flows. That's normal.\n\nBut the primary driver of negative cash flow from operations is the fact that they extend more new loans than they recoup old loans who have reached maturity and are repaid to ARCC by their clients. Looking at FY 2022:\n\u2022 proceeds from sale and repayment of investments (i.e., clients repaying old loans to ARCC) = $7.747 billion\n\u2022 purchase of investments (i.e., new loans made by ARCC to clients) = $(9.852) billion\n \nBasically, they're still growing their asset base.",

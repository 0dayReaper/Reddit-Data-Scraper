Taking that advice and applying it to individual securities is ridiculous.\n\nAt Enron's peak, 23 August 2000, its share price was $90.75 and it was an economic juggernaut diversifying into various markets, \"America's most innovative company\" six years running according to *Fortune* magazine, with massive revenue for its organizational size. On 26 September 2001, it was \"on sale\" for $25.15/share, and anyone who bought on that day had the satisfaction of seeing their investment go up to $36.76 on 11 October 2001, a recovery of +46% in just over two weeks. By 2 December 2001, they were trading at $0.26/share and declared bankruptcy.\n\nThey don't always go back up.\n\nEdit: for those discounting Enron as an example because of corporate fraud, just insert GM above. Major corporation, deemed essential, bailed out by the federal government, shareholders still went to 0. Or hell, wonder where Delta bought a bunch of cheap infrastructure from in 1991?

Who knows, there could be plenty of corporate fraud out there that could be exposed by a recession. Or maybe not.\n\nIf you'd like a non-fraudulent example, GM got a federal bailout during the last recession and is still a major functioning company today, but shareholders still got nothing. Who's to say the same won't happen to Delta? **I'm not saying it will or offering an opinion on any individual stock**, I am just saying that people who comment \"keep buying\" as a knee-jerk reaction to *an individual stock* going down are being foolish. If, however, they do their own analysis first and then decide that that's the best course of action, then power to them. It just has to be specific.",

That is why banks are looking for guidance on all these new small business loan programs -- they want to not only get paid but to make a profit in doing so.  Banks aren't charities.",

I think the whole market is precarious at the moment, but AMD has continued to improve in every way. They will continue to gain ground on Intel and I would put money into AMD before any other chip maker's stock still.\n\nHell, I didn't even see this coming, but they just released a laptop chip that decimates Intel's offerings. It outperforms or at least matches Intel's current best and takes anywhere from 25% to 100% less power doing it, depending on the TDP setting of each implimentation, and there's no sign Intel has anything to beat that coming up soon. They might retake the performance crown, but perf/wattage is in the bag for AMD as long as Intel's foundry troubles continue.\n\nWhat I was betting on in the ride from 2 to 27 was a lot of very believable info about Ryzen being great for servers. Sure enough, the stock price responded almost exactly with server marketshare. If AMD can avoid Intel playing dirty with the major manufacturers, they now have the best server, HEDT, budget desktop, and laptop CPU's. There's zero excuse for Intel's monopoly in the laptop space to continue. Since laptops are something like 70% of PC purchases, I expect similar gains as that changes.",

When airlines were grounded after the 9/11 attacks and subsequently did not provide adequate returns to investors, was that somehow not a red flag?

They sell seats and every single seat on every single plane looks the same.  Only a very narrow segment of their market wants the perks and luxury upcharges and even then, all airlines are essentially the same even in this regard.  A first class seat is still basically a commodity given how interchangeable it is across carriers.

Just the tip, lmao, am I right, famma-lam?\n\nBut before we get started, make sure to *smaaaaaaash* that Like button, tap the ass of that Subscribe button, and ring that notification bell. [Doorbell chime sound.]\n\nToday\u2019s stock of the day is an old-school stock called Enron. A lot of old ass motherfuckers used to make bank on this shit in the late 90s and the early 2000s, I guess during the Vietnam War or some shit. Anyway, this shit was lit, they had dope ass energy products and MA BOI Kenneth Lay is the CEO! His fucking last name is **LAY**! So you know my boi KL lays more pipe than just oil pipelines. He\u2019s probably getting *all* the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders pregnant.\n\nSo that brings us to tip 2. Before you invest in a company, always look at the CEO. If he looks like a fuckin\u2019 nerd, **left swipe that bitch**. But if he\u2019s a dope-ass motherfucker with a bangin\u2019 name? Back up the truck, and get ready to make a buck.\n\nAlright that\u2019s all the tips I got for you right now. I\u2019mma bout to to hit the bong and trade some Tesla and Carnival Cruise options.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to sign up for Battle Legends using my affiliate code. You\u2019ll get 65,000 gold coins.

These kids apparently didn\u2019t know what happened in 2008.  \n\nLot of these guys are no older than 30 and just bought into the very beginning of the 10-year bull run. As in they somehow got into a well-paying job at the bottom of the last recession (or in one case, I suspect one of them got a job from their own dad) and market timed through pure luck. Notice how a lot of them played up dividend investing and retiring by 40. Soon as CV hit, lot of them went hilariously dark.  \n\nTurns out there's more to investing than just throwing darts at a board and picking stocks that got the pin.",

I bet there's some insane value there that no one else is seeing!\" Y'all are so pathetic. So many people saying they're gonna stay away now without doing any of their own research. So many people just buy whatever Buffett buys just because it's Buffett. Have you ever looked at a financial statement? Have you ever done any financial modeling or projections? Have you even bothered to closely observe Delta or Southwest, or are you just following daddy Buffett way too late once again? You aren't value investors, or even informed investors.

He also laughed and said that he definitely wouldn't be selling airline stocks to Yahoo Finance just a month ago. My guess is that he needed to get under 10% so that he can sell a bigger portion of his stake without having to disclose it within two days. As a LUV and DAL shareholder, I'm really hoping he'll give a good excuse for selling or I will have lost a lot of respect for him. Not for losing money, but for saying he wouldn't sell and then doing it anyway.",

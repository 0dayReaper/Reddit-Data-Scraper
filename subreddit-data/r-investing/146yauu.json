It will be in a college town with a very varied wealth distribution meaning, there\u2019s plenty of people would would need the laundry mats. How much management is required and what are the profit margins. I\u2019ll do my own research too but Reddit has proven to be an efficient means to gain info.",

            "comment": " laundromats, I love the business because it's lots of coins coming in all cash and there are ancillary cash Revenue such as soap machine ice machine candy machine Etc . you can easily hire someone inexpensively for a wash and full service and that can be highly profitable. Now for the bad, utilities are usually very stifling even with newer equipment and you must have new equipment to be efficient .the gas , water, sewer and Electric charges will eat away at your profits. You need a a busy location and at least two or three locations in order to make a decent living. In my opinion many of the old time operators have gotten out of the business. Car Wash is forever popular it will cost you closer to 750,000 for a real one and that also has a lot of ancillary cash flow through merchandising multi-wash tickets. That was a high theft business from employees but now everything is computerized and most people use credit cards so your theft to sales ratio will be lower than it's ever been due to technology. You have to have special equipment to do recycling of your water best to have a separate well and t h e r e ve is always plenty of consumer complaints many of them are fraudulent about car damage. Car Wash if you're in a busy location you will do very well. Very labor intense. I would prefer to have self-service a couple washing b a y s located in half a dozen busy gas stations",

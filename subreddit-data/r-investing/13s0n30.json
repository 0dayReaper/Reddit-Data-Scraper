    "postText": "I'm not super fluent in the interesting world and have kept things relatively simple.  \n\nI was pitched a spread of a few structured notes, one with auto calls yearly starting at 13.5% with principal protection of 30%.   It's structured out 7 years with the final year reaching 94% return - which is I think 9% equivalent over the term. \n\nThere's another note at 7 years with a 120% return.  \n\nThese are both based on a Canadian index and are called if the index is flat or higher at term. \n\nApologies, I likely screwed up some lingo but I think I have put it down so you can pick it up.  Happy to clarify anything. \n\nI'm told these are back tested 30 years and over the full term the odds of them being called approach 100%.  \n\nGrains of salt with all of this, but it makes sense to my lament ears.  \n\nI'm thinking of putting some money in this but will keep some for ETF's or other ideas. \n\nWe are told these notes based off an American bank index are shit. But the ones on a Canadian bank are quite good.  \n\nAny insight would be appreciated.  \n\nCheers",

If you don't need the funds over the next 3 - 7 years, then I would recommend investing into them. I have never experienced a note that goes all the way to the 7th year because it usually is called by the bank in around second or third year (when the index exceeds the callable level of 105 or 110). \n\nI suggest that you go wtih one that provides the same return every year (say 10% or 12%), 25% or 30% protection barrier, and Canadian Banks as the underlying index. The Canadian Banks are safe and conservative. It's all Canada has. So, the government won't let them collapse.",

That's all the Canadian economy has. So, the government is not going to let them fail. Having said that, do understand that the payout is going to be dependent on how the underlying performs. So, just be prepared that there MAY be a few months you won't receive any interest. Also, be prepared that you may have to commit to the full 7 years.

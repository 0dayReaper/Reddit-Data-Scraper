    "postText": "So I checked my current rate on bonds purchased in November 2021. It's sitting at 3.38%!\n\nThis is kind of crap since you can get above 4% from a Money Market Fund.\n\nIt also seems like inflation is moderating so I wouldn't expect the I-bond rate to increase.\n\nI'm thinking about just redeeming all the bonds and dumping into said MMF. I know I'll lose the last 3 months of interest but I'd say it's worth it.\n\nWhat does everyone think? Any reason not to redeem? Thanks",

Like if you bought an i-bond just before a rate change, you'd still earn 6 months of interest at your original rate, then it would change to the new rate for 6 months, which repeats until you sell. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong because I was just trying to figure this out for myself and Treasury Direct sucks.",

If you go to treasury direct, you will not see the third interest rate at, for example, the 13th month. You will see the second interest rate.",

In fact you two are saying exactly the same thing for how early redemption works, but with a different mental model.\n\n\"Receiving interest 3 months late\" (which is when it shows up in the account) is the same as losing the last 3 months as a penalty. The only difference is past the 5 year mark, once the bonds have no penalty to redeem.",

For example, let\u2019s say you bought your I-Bond on November 1, 2021. Two years later, on October 31, 2023, you\u2019ve gone through four 6-month rates; let\u2019s say on November 1 in 2023, the rate drops precipitously and you want to get out but only lose the penalty in the new low rate. Then, you can cash out as early as February 2024. However, if you instead bought in January 2022, you\u2019d be getting the same exact rates as the first example, but your I-Bonds would experience each rate change 2 months later. So, in this second example, if you wanted to end up with the same interest as the first example, you\u2019d want to cash out in April 2024, instead.",

I am curious to see the data over the next few months though.\n\nI do agree that the fed isn't gonna tolerate inflation staying at the current level. I think they're gonna pause in June, but if core PCE doesn't go down i think they'll start hiking again no later than the fall.\n\nSo we shall see what happens next.",

I do think it's gonna be pretty hard for CPI to go above 5% again, but it's pretty easy to stay around 4% for too long. \n\nSo in terms of I bond vs just regular bond or mmf, you should probably stick with mmf or just regular Treasury bond for higher yields. And if CPI just stays at above 4% by the end of the year, the fed will definitely raise rates again but this time closer to 5.75% which again means higher yields for mmf. I tend to follow what fed Bullard says, even though he's considered a super hawk, he's been right for more than 1 year when it comes to how high the fed needs to go, and he thinks the fed has to hike rate by 0.5% more this year.",

Sure, hindsight is 20/20 and balancing your port with some sort of saftey is good, but they could've gotten the same safety from high grade bonds but actually beat inflation for the last 2 decades.\n\nI Bonds were a totally reasonable play over the last 18 months because of the very unique situation, but now their yield is essentially back to garbage. They're not meant to do anything other than stave off inflation, that's it.",

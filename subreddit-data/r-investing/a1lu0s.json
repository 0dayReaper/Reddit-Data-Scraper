Splitting shares into classes allows those who want a say in the company, and those who just want dividends/value, to not have to compete for the same pool of shares.  If all shares were the same it would mean a whole bunch of vote dilution and could create a situation where someone owns a small percent of total shares, but has a majority vote due to most not participating in that system.  \n\nOn the flip side, it allows owners to retain control of their company while also issuing shares.  They get the benefit of investment without the drawback of accountability to those investors.  Since there's so much information about the markets, and they're designed to be as confusing as possible, you might not even know the shares you own are non-voting, meaning you have no say in how your investment is used.  While this prevents hostile takeovers, it also ensures terrible management remains unchallenged.  It's why Elon Musk can cuss out and hang-up on investors and they can't do much of anything about it.  Musk still controls the majority of voting shares.\n\nIf you intend to participate in company decisions, it's important to know which class of shares you need to purchase.  Voting shares are usually more expensive, and some classes don't even pay dividends(they're solely for voting).",

That is exactly why these different types of shares exist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo let's say a company divides itself into 100 pieces. Each piece is a share. Typically, a business will have a meeting for everyone with a piece of the company to come together and decide by vote who should be in charge of the company, how the company should be run, etc.  For voting purposes, each of the 100 pieces would get one vote. Now let's say you're the company founder, and over the years you have kept 51 pieces for your self. Congratulations! Whatever you want to vote for happens, because you have a simple majority (you wouldn't split your own votes against yourself, would you?)  Now let's assume you fell on hard times and sold 2 shares, so now you only have 49 shares; and you said something really bad, and the owners of the other 51 shares hate you. They now have the majority, and use their 51 votes to override you forever. Maybe they vote to sell the company to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo overcome this scenario, businesses have come up with voting shares, and non-voting shares. Now let's pretend the previous scenario happens, but when you set up the company, you created 50 voting shares and 50 non-voting shares, and kept the voting shares to yourself. You still fall on hard times and sell off two shares: one voting, and one non-voting. Now it doesn't matter what you do or say, because when you sold off 2 shares, you only sold one voting share. You still only have 49 shares, but there's only one other vote out there floating around. You maintain control of the company because no one can out-vote you, even though you no longer own more than 50% of the company.",

There are a couple governance issues in particular that tend to pique their interest. One class of issues might be termed control rights. As others have suggested, institutional shareholders tend to dislike provisions that dilute or minimize their voting rights relative to their holdings. Along the same lines, they tend to disfavor anti-takeover measures like poison pills. They like to ensure that they have say in directors, so resolutions that reserve or create seats for independent directors are often favored. Funds and other institutional holders are also sensitive to their own public image and things that might be seen as burnishing that. So voting in favor of shareholder resolutions that might advance that \u2014 and that aren\u2019t facially detrimental to the company\u2019s financial performance or ability to operate \u2014 are favored. These often come in the form of things like diversity initiatives for board composition or employee hiring, or any number of lip-service resolutions pandering to issues in the public eye. \n\nExecutive compensation can be a little tricky and go either way. Funds are sensitive to the notion that executive compensation should align management\u2019s interest with increasing shareholder value. But that can sometimes be difficult to ascertain. Funds also recognize, in the one hand, that there is a competition for top talent, favoring generous compensation packages, and, on the other hand, that compensation packages that appear outsized or disproportionate, whether measured by company financial performance or in comparison to average worker compensation, are perceived negatively. \n\nAnd, of course, funds pay attention to and vote their perceived economic interests in strategic decisions that are put to shareholders. A proposed merger would be a typical example. ",

The market is extremely good at determining the price of the stocks, so its difficult for active management to beat the market.  The causes more people to use index funds.  If it starts to swing too far the other way, it will create opportunities for active management to invest in undervalued companies, thus encouraging active management.  It seems to me that active vs passive will swing back and forth, but generally push toward middle ground.",

You can't know if the index will fall 15 or 20% during the next 10 years. If your main goal is to keep your wealth at maximum safety and you're ok with lower yields, I don't see why you wouldn't just buy government debt. Maybe I'm very risk averse, but that's what I'd do if the Euro bonds weren't so stupidly low right now.",

Bad companies are weeded out when their liabilities exceed their assets and they can no longer continue to be a viable business. It seems like what you want to say is that indexes lead to overvaluing certain companies. But that just increases opportunities for people who want to be active investors. the price of a stock really has nothing to do with companies being weeded out. Stock price has nothing to do with fundamentals.",

Fund flows are proportional to the market cap. This would murder the market cap and fund flows with it.  Not to mention each new equity issuance would be worth less than the last because of dilution.

There is a point that as passive investing grows there will be more opp for active investors, so it will never capture 100% of the market. That is very true. But, my point is that in general it is in society's interest to have as many discriminators of where capital goes as possible. Reduce that mechanism and it's not good\n\nHonestly, it's hard to follow your point, because it keeps changing. I was addressing this point you made:\n\n\"It is active investors that say \"this company has lost all their money, is 100 billion in debt, and has no plan. I will stay away from their equity offering\" that make a company go bankrupt\"\n\n&gt; It destroys the stock price.\n\nWhich causes active investors to bail leading the stock price even lower along with the market cap. are we doing some kind of academic exercise here where we imagine what the market would look like if it were 100% controlled by funds? Because I was talking about the actual market not this theoretical one that you seem to be talking about.\n",

Index investing is primarily done by retail investors, which is why its only 17% of the market. Thats nothing. It is a non-issue until index investing is large enough to matter - which will never occur because institutional money will by and large always be actively managed. ",

Well worth reading:\n\nhttps://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/investing-without-people.pdf\n\nThe nut of the article, in my view, is this: if active investors are effectively setting price, then widespread active investing is what makes it impossible for active investors, on average net of fees, to beat the market, which is the justification for passive (index and otherwise) funds. But if the the proportion of active investors trading stocks is displaced by passive funds, will that displacement reach a point at which active investing once again becomes profitable?\n\nI believe the answer must be yes. With enough passive investing, at some point, the dollars being invested actively become too small to materially change the price of a security. This will create opportunities (including potential arbitrage) for active investors, some of whom will succeed. Money will aggregate or flow to those active managers until, on balance, the fees charged equal the profits being reaped. ",

At the very least stocks have been choppy or flat with the first signal of an inversion. \n\nAm I getting in my own way by liquidaying my stock exposure now? \n\nOr should I jsut stop researching and   continue to DCA into the VOO?\n\nThanks!",

The yield curve is heavily over hyped, and while i do agree the economy is likely to get worse in the second half of the year, that doesn't mean the stock market is useless. The reality is that stocks bottom before the economy does, and recover while a recession is still going on. You won't be able to time that.\n\nSo yeah, ignore the noise and the fear mongering and stick to your strategy. I know i am.",

I see most of that evidence telling me we may be in for a Bitcoin style twin peak move. Im betting on that. \n\nMy only real issue is people saying \"Its too hard, just DCA\" as market advice to others.

My strategy involves protecting my account by entering and exiting regulary. Your strategy involves DCAing every dip. We are not the same. Your post is basically talking to yourself. I will be fine no matter what happens. \n\nAnd I will be pissy when I see the lazy trying to infect others and show them off the same cliff. This isn't about market direction.

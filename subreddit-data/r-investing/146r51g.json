            "comment": "Worst case taxation $600 (this assumes all $3k are gains) and best case $0. Will depend on your MAGI (gross income minus pre-tax retirement contributions) and if your gains are long-term (&gt;12 months holding period) or short-term (&lt;12 months holding period)If your broker is \u201cfirst in first out\u201d, then likely long term. Long term capital gains tax rates for most folks will be 0% or 15%. 0% up to ~$84k, I believe. 15% between ~$84k and ~$500k-ish.\n\nExample: My MAGI is $75k. If I bought $1k in 2018 and went to sell now for $2k, my long term capital gain is $1k, but my tax is 0%. If my MAGI is $100k, my tax in the same scenario is $150.\n\nAll of the above is Federal taxation. You should research your state taxation implications as they tend to vary state to state.\n\nHope this helps!",

Each lot, has it's own gain and loss based on the time the money was added to the fund (basis).  Most firms, Vanguard, Fidelity, etc.  will let you setup a tax favored withdrawal policy.  It's worth a call to Vanguard and have a discussion with them.  Could really help you in your situation.  If you bought the fund all at once, then you'll only have one lot, and then this point is mute.[https://www.tdameritrade.com/education/personal-finance/taxes/what-is-a-tax-lot.html](https://www.tdameritrade.com/education/personal-finance/taxes/what-is-a-tax-lot.html)",

If you bought them over time, you would have purchased each batch at different prices.  When you sell, the gain that you\u2019re taxed on is the sale price - purchase price for the particular shares you sell.  So if you choose shares with the highest purchase price, you\u2019ll have the least gain to pay taxes on.",

Deferring is good but reducing is better.\n\nAt minimum, there will be a little bit of short term just from dividend reinvestment.",

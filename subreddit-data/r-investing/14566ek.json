    "postText": "I started investing in 2018. My parents connected me with a family friend who is an financial advisor at EJ. Unfortunately, I did not do my research and just went with their suggestion. I think at the time I was overwhelmed and just wanted to put leftover cash to work but not really have to think about it. \n\nWhile I like my advisor personally, I am frustrated by his work. \n\n1) He is very stubborn about EJ's risk tolerance corridors. I received a small windfall from my grandfather passing, much of which was in blue chip securities. He's been very aggressive about selling these securities to get the portfolio to EJ's preferred balance given my risk tolerance, leaving me with unnecessarily large capital gains exposure (A couple of these stocks were purchased in the 80s!)\n\n2) He's demonstrated unusual ignorance about pretty basic concepts. For example, we were reviewing my personal budget following a salary increase and he didn't understand marginal tax brackets. \n\n3) Most importantly, the performance of my portfolio is subpar. It is definitely a more balanced portfolio, yet I seemed to catch the worst of 2022, without the massive upside of '20, '21' and positive start of '23. \n\n2019: +18%\n\n2021: + 11%\n\n2022: -17%\n\n2023: +5%\n\nDue to all these reasons, I am considering starting a self-managed new brokerage account (open to suggestions) focused largely on index funds. Fortunately, my EJ advisor is in his mid 60s and likely retiring soon. When he does, I will move over my funds to the new brokerage. \n\nAm I overreacting to the performance of my portfolio? Is it a bad idea to start a second brokerage account?",

            "comment": "With regard to point 1, you don\u2019t inherit the cost basis of your grandfather\u2019s stocks. If you somehow did your taxes based on that assumption, that was incorrect and you paid way too much in tax. Your cost basis \u2014 the price at which you effectively bought the stocks for tax purposes \u2014 is determined by the price when you inherited them. See the term \u201cstep-up in basis\u201d.\n\nI would suggest leaving EJ as soon as possible. You won\u2019t get out of it by your advisor simply retiring; he\u2019ll try to transfer you to someone else. The fees they charge are not worth it, and you can manage your own simple portfolio without someone else interfering.\n\nIn my view, Schwab and Fidelity are the best brokers for most US citizens. They have virtually every feature one could need for all types of accounts, they have their own in-house mutual funds with no minimum initial investment, and great customer service (especially Schwab).",

            "comment": "As others have mentioned you may have done your taxes wrong.  I'll also note that while it is nice to compound on long term capital gains the extra drag isn't that much.  The worse problem will likely be the portfolio (though EJ has gotten better about holding fund costs down) and the advisor fee. \n\nEJ is pretty close to bottom of the barrel in terms of advisor quality.  They do take smaller clients though than most advisories.  If you want to manage yourself you can do it.  Or you can compromise on a robo at around 25 basis points.",

            "comment": "I would check out M1 as a way to start.  You can build a portfolio or copy someone else's and they buy into your investments as a block.  I'm not explaining it very well, but if your looking for a place that gives you control and simplicity, I find I liked M1 for that.  Watch a review or two on youtube and explore the website to see if its what you want. I've tried most of the  newer online companies, plus Fidelity, Schwab, and Etrade.  If you're uncomfortable going with one of the newer investment apps, then definitely shoot for fidelity as their interface is intuitive and easy to follow.",

Get on your new lane as soon as possible.  Be sure to copy the particulars of your portfolio (cost basis etc) before you transfer the assets.  Usually transfer is smooth but make sure.",

            "comment": "Actually your returns are fine for older folks. To say the least they are respectable. For example, if you owned S&amp;P500 -18% is what the return was in 2022.  Many Redditors lost -20 to 35% last year being too attached to high tech stocks (faang). Arkk had +152% gain in 2020 before many investors lost most if any left.\n\nHowever, it is time to move on to your style of management. Just transfer the funds to a different brokerage. For better for worse, you are in charge of your destiny.  Good luck to you.",

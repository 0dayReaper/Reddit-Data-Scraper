    "postText": "I asked this in various Daily Threads on the Stocks and Investing subreddits but didn't get a response, so I'll try in the main subreddit.\n\nI'd appreciate someone's input on the discrepancy in valuations reported by Morningstar with that of an ETF's fund documents. Consider [AVDV, an actively managed Avantis fund](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/avantis-investments/avantis-international-small-cap-value-etf/) that tracks small cap value companies outside of the US and in developed markets. It is extremely diversified within its segment, [with 1336 companies](https://i.imgur.com/bE0NH1A.png) and [none with more than 0.75% weight](https://i.imgur.com/Au4jmmc.png). The weighted average market cap is $1.7B--where by weighted they multiply each market cap by its weight in the ETF, not simply averaging the market caps. This is stated in [their definition](https://i.imgur.com/g4UPsTi.png). They go on to calculate similar weighted valuation metrics:\n\n- Weighted Average Book/Market 1.06x [i.e., B/P]\n- Weighted Average Profits/Book of 0.32x. [i.e. E/B]\n- An implied E/P ratio of (1.06)*(0.32) = 0.34\n- An implied **P/E ratio** of 1 / (0.34) = **2.94**\n- An implied **P/B ratio** of 1 / 1.06 = **0.94**.\n\nOn the other hand, [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/avdv/portfolio) states that the **P/E of AVDV was 7.16** and the **P/B is 0.84**. [Here are all their valuation metrics.](https://i.imgur.com/zpIuixB.png)\n\nWhy is Morningstar giving a P/E ratio that is 2.94x higher than the fund documents? Is this because Morningstar doesn't do any weighting and literally just averages the P/E of every company in the ETF no matter its weight? Does it have to do with the treatment of negative earnings companies? Simultaneously, Morningstar has a P/B ratio of 0.84 which is *lower* than the Avantis document's implied 0.94 ratio. So Morningstar has a more expensive P/E ratio but cheaper P/B ratio.\n\nBoth sources indicate this sector and ETF is extremely cheap, but I'm very interested in if it is as cheap as implied by Avantis.",

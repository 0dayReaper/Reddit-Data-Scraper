    "postText": "\nWould I better off just opening a regular IRA account for my child instead of a 529 college savings account? I feel like there is a bit more flexibility in a IRA compared to the 529 but I\u2019m not sure. there is a level of uncertainty that my child, may never go to college and the funds can be used for other things such as buying a house or continuing to save for their own retirement. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

To withdraw before retirement, it's either all Roth IRA contributions and then $10k for first time home buying, and only the penalties are waived, income taxes still apply. It's not like a savings account that you just withdraw whenever you want.\n\nFor education, 529 is way better. You also can now roll up to $35k from a 529 to a Roth IRA.",

            "comment": "https://finaid.org/savings/ugma/\n\n\n&gt; For financial aid purposes, custodial accounts are considered assets of the student. This means that custodial bank and brokerage accounts have a high impact on financial aid eligibility. However, since 2009-10 the treatment of custodial 529 college savings plans has been more favorable. A custodial 529 plan of a dependent student is treated as an asset of the parent on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This means that a custodial 529 college savings plan for a dependent student has a low impact on financial aid eligibility. Thus one method of dealing with the financial aid impact of a custodial bank or brokerage account is to liquidate the account and transfer the proceeds into a custodial 529 plan account. If money is transferred from an UGMA/UTMA account to a section 529 plan, the section 529 plan should be titled the same as the UGMA/UTMA account. When the child reaches the age of trust termination, the child will become the account owner for the section 529 plan. The custodian is not permitted to change the beneficiary of the section 529 plan, because the responsibility of the custodian to use the assets of the UGMA/UTMA account for the benefit of the child does not terminate when the funds are withdrawn from the account.",

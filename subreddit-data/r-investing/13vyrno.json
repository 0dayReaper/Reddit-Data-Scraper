            "comment": "as a general rule, the old advice is to avoid bonds in a taxable brokerage. but that's not 100% accurate for everyone, all of the time. partly because ETFs have changed the game so much. \n\nbond funds tend to have very high turnover (buying/selling of assets within the fund), and this can create capital gains taxes for mutual funds. \n\nbut ETFs are structured to minimize capital gains taxes, so they have little or no capital gains taxes relative to a comparable mutual fund. imagine a bond mutual fund and a bond ETF both have a 50% turnover rate (compared to 3-5% for a typical stock index fund). if you held $10k in the bond mutual fund, that's potentially capital gains taxes on $5k per year. but with a similar bond ETF, there would be little or no taxes on the capital gains each year, only taxes on the dividends.",

That's because I have more in taxable than in tax advantaged and I just don't have the room in my tax advantaged accounts for my complete bond allocation.\n\nTraditionally it is advised that you should keep bonds in tax advantaged space, but in doing that you are squeezing out some growth opportunities.  It also neglects the huge difference between pre tax and Roth.  Some now advise keeping bonds in taxable.  \n\nI keep zero bonds in Roth, a pretty healthy allocation of a broad bond fund in pre-tax (traditional), plus in-state Muni bonds in taxable.",

Like this one. https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/tax-equivalent-yield-calculator-tool/\n\nIf regular bonds and bond funds come out ahead, just use those. It's likely you aren't in a high enough tax bracket for it to work out in your favor, or maybe it's a wash.  If your income is likely to go up in the future though, it wouldn't hurt to start now.",

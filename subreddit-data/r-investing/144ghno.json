I plan on distributing my funds across all 4 evenly. That said, what are your thoughts on my investment selections and allocation of funds?",

Second, what I forsee is likely going to be critical in the future.\n\nhttps://etfdb.com/compare/highest-5-year-returns/no-leveraged/\n\nThe answer to that is primarily the big info tech companies and semiconductors.  So I look to make a base holding around that primarily via three infotech ETFs (XLK, IYW, QQQ) and three semiconductor ones (SMH, SOXX, XSD).  After that I decide what individual stocks I want to go heavier on (or are missed by the ETFs altogether, like SMCI) so I get those.  Then I save some for wide variety of the best other ETFs and stocks to keep an eye on that I might temporarily get... like fossil fuel stocks last spring.\n\nSo while big tech is today my core holdings, I also am willing to get some obvious short term stuff like oil and more speculative longterm stuff like clean energy, lithium, infrastructure, robotics/IA companies not covered by semiconductors, cybersecurity, etc.",

Here\u2019s another take, what if the stock market takes a large hit and you have a medical emergency that warrants you to withdraw from the HSA. If you do QQQ or something volatile, you may be forced to withdraw at a bad time. In contrast, an IRA is something for 30+ years into the future if you\u2019re young and the volatility can be manageable because you\u2019re looking at such a long timeframe.\n\nHere\u2019s my advice. S&amp;P 500 (FXAIX) and VTI for HSA because its a bit more balanced of growth and value stocks. You\u2019re account will still grow, but you\u2019re not going to take a 30%+ cut like QQQ did last year (minus huge recession). IRA you can do more QQQ and mix it up depending on your risk preference",

Mine is like 70/30 FXAIX and AVUV right now.  Indexed TDFs are also decent if you don't know what to do.",

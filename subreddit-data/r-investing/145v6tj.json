Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  \n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  \n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)  \n* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?  \n* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.  \n\nPlease consider consulting our FAQ first - https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/faq\nAnd our [side bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/about/sidebar) also has useful resources.  \n\nIf you are new to investing - please refer to Wiki - [Getting Started](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/gettingstarted/)\n\nThe reading list in the wiki has a list of books ranging from light reading to advanced topics depending on your knowledge level.

The rest of 50% are allocated as the following:\n\n\u2022 50% into stocks (ETF/mutual fund, preferably index fund, domestic, dividend reinvestment)\n\n\u2022 50% into bonds (ETF/mutual fund, mix of sovereign/corporate, domestic, bond coupon reinvestment)\n\nAll earnings are reallocated to preserve the ratios. Any drops or rises are re-balanced from/to the less affected investment products each month.\n\nI would like to hear about the issues that such strategy might imply.",

The last two are a bit too unwieldy for me, and I already have CDs and savings accounts, so I was thinking about whether the strategy may improve the gains. I'm mostly interested in the cases when the local financial regulator lowers their rate and CDs/savings account interests go down as well. Historically, such course of action benefited stock/bond holders quite nicely (at the expense of depositors). \n\nSince I don't feel I'm competent enough to tell when the regulator is going to raise or lower the rate, I'm just thinking about 50%/50% ratio. \n\nI like bonds because crashes happen and a recent crash my investment portfolio had endured has shown me their benefit of a much quicker price recovery that stocks lack.\n\nBTW, the local regulator's rate is far from both negative area and zero and will remain so for a foreseeable future.",

What you suggest is a fine starting point, but if over time your fixed returns do lag inflation and your stock returns beat inflation, then its just up to you decide if you want to switch the percentages.",

            "comment": "Hey everyone! I wanted to give an update. My wife and I invested $20,000 for start up on and FIA account through AllianzLife and they gave a 32% match on initial investment. We are also in the process of being approved for an IUL account each. We each have great 401K accounts through Fidelity with our jobs, at 6% with 100% matches. With all of that being said, we still have about $80,000 in savings and are looking to invest more and continue diversifying our portfolio. We have agreed to rent a house for the time being, as we see the rates are too high and the return on a house today may not be what we put in. Are there any other ways I may be able to diversify my portfolio that I should look into? Thank y\u2019all!",

            "comment": "Hi, name\u2019s David! \n\nI\u2019m 27 living in NYC, USA. I work a $27/hr 8-5 M-F job. I make $1600 every 2 weeks (after tax). I plan to not stay in this job so hopefully within a year I\u2019ll find something better in terms of a programming job. I started saving in my Acorns account $100 a week but plan to save around $1500 a month after I pay off all my CC debt which should all be paid before August. I always pay on time so I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to pay off my debt before the target month. \n\nI\u2019m making this post because I want to know if Acorns is a good investing app? I\u2019m completely new to investing (which is why I resulted to using Acorns (robo-advisor if that\u2019s what people call it)). I use Acorns mainly for my savings account and I plan not to touch it til I\u2019m 60+ or hopefully til I make a million from it. \n\n I\u2019m thinking long term and I want to know if I should continue putting my money into my acorns account? Is there other savings/investing accounts better for long term? If so, can anyone recommend? Just know that I\u2019m new to investing (new as in, I don\u2019t even know how a 401k works or is utilized)  so if you do advise a investing account/etc. especially if it requires me to sacrifice time to learn knowledge I need to invest smartly, guides/ tips/tricks or resources would help alongside with your app recommendation.\n\nI hope I\u2019ve provided the I formation needed. If I\u2019m missing anything or I need to share any additional information, please let me know.\n\nMany thanks!",

The fees are a high percentage early in your investing journey, but gradually decrease as time goes on.   Their most aggressive fund is highly diverse, but not really as aggressive as most would like.  \n\nBetter brokers for long-term investing are Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard in a Roth Individual Retirement Account (Roth IRA).  No fees for having a Roth IRA account.  Look to invest into a Total USA index mutual fund or ETF.  The performance are nearly the same for all of them with super low expense ratios.\n\nExample:\n\nFidelity's FZROX with a 0% expense ratio.  Index mutual fund.\n\nSchwab's SWTSX with a 0.03% expense ratio.  Index mutual fund.\n\nVanguard's VTI with a 0.03%expense ratio.  ETF.\n\nCheck Investopedia for terms and definitions.  \nCheck the Boglehead community for retirement investing ideas.",

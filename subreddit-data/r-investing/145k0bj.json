            "comment": "If these are the only two orders available, then I believe the trade would be executed at $16 dollars. But given how there will be other bids/asks on the market that might fill these it\u2019s hard to say.\n\nBut if these orders do get filled, the most expensive price the buyer could get is $20 and the lowest price the seller could get is $16.",

It seems that even ChatGPT gets it wrong:\n\n&gt;In the scenario you described, the first order placed was a bid for 5 units at $20. Then, a sell order for 5 units at $16 was placed. Since the bid was placed before the sell order and at a higher price, the trade would be executed at the best available price, which is the price of the bid at $20 per unit.\n\nThis assumes 20 comes before 16, as to what happens when they're at the same time:\n\n&gt;if two market orders are placed at the same time, the order in which they are processed and executed depends on the system's order handling rules.\n\nAlso, I found this on Quora:\n\n&gt;Remember, your limit order means fill at or better price else don\u2019t fill\n\nSo if someone places 16 after 20, then it can get filled at 20 if I understood correctly.",

When I said the trade would execute at $16 I was biasing the price in favor of the buyer (the buyer gets a price lower than $20 while the seller gets their worst possible price).\n\nLooking at this problem again I really can\u2019t say a specific number, but I\u2019d say if these are the only two orders on the market it\u2019d execute at a price between $16-$20 (depending on some mechanisms I frankly don\u2019t know enough about lol).",

The execution price will depend on what the current NBBO (national best bid offer) of the stock is at the time the orders are placed. Market makers on listed exchanges are required to quote their best spread during trading hours. \n\nA buy order - whether it's marketable or limit - will not exceed the best ask.\n\nA sell order - whether it's marketable or limit - will not exceed the best bid.\n\nThere are also times when a liquidity provider or internalized crossing system may result in a price improvement inside the NBBO spread.",

The standard ones are just common agreements. Even with brokers that seem to be purely electronic, I guarantee you the functionality exists to pull orders out of that queue and execute them in a manual queue.\n\nAll types are just instructions on how they may vary that price to the market. If you think this could open up matters of conflict of interest, you're right. I think the only help in this situation is to check what the broker's buy/hold/sell is. If your order is in line with that, you're likely good.  If it's contrary, you may not want to order there.\n\nIf you see an instance where they recommend one way, but treat your order in another, sue the shit out of that broker.",

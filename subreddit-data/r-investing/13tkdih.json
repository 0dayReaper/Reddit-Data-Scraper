    "postText": "I feel like a lot of markets are just dominated right now, and we aren't seeing many new innovative or even controversial players in a lot of spaces. For instance, Amazon is dominating online shopping, Google is the same for search, MSFT and AAPL are pretending to compete in their own space, retail has had the same major players for decades, same story for oil and cars (TSLA definitely is no longer up and coming), etc. Are there any medium sized companies that you think of as players in a space people are unsure of? Also, don't say crypto. Whether or not you believe in that, I just don't want to go down that road here.",

During the pandemic when a lot of LV casinos were closed VICI still collected 100% of their rents as the landlord.\n\nThey also own golf courses and fine restaurants. They do not invest in half empty urban office buildings.\n\nFull disclosure: we are long this holding with an asset allocation of 2% of our portfolio.",

Compliance and regulations present a challenge for businesses to meet demands for distribution. It\u2019s almost like the playoffs, similar to the what banks face today, where big fish eat small fish. \n\nSort of a conspiracy but the trend is very real and happening today. Lobbyists acting on behalf of big corporation\u2019s interests are driving agencies to increase standards and thus, benefit those with capital to play. \n\nAmazon loves lobbying and they have the power to make politicians dance. \n\nAssume markets take a big hit and drug retailers like Walgreens get obliterated. Amazon\u2019s cash in hand for Q1 2023 was almost $50 billion. They\u2019d be able to buy them out easily. \n\nPrice\u2019s Law talks about the principle of how a small minority gets the vast majority. It\u2019s nature and in capitalism, the minority appears to be reducing, while they get even more. \n\nNobody has a crystal ball so we\u2019re all spewing here but big corporations are ruthless and they\u2019re only getting bigger. Look at the banking industry.",

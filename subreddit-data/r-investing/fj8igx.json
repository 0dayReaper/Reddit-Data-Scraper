America has gone from a robust growing economy with normal consumer behavior to canceling travel, not dining out, no large gatherings, not visiting public places, etc within the span of about a week and a half.  This is by any measure a completely unprecedented drop in consumer activity and thus demand.\n\nThe Fed is responding to bigger issues: because of this companies have started to draw heavily on credit lines to do basic stuff like cover expenses and meet payroll - this is putting a ton of strain on credit markets.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-liquidity-idUSKBN210174\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-11/-50-trillion-in-question-after-u-s-treasury-liquidity-dries-up\n\nThis is by any account a completely unprecedented situation.",

I passed by four grocery stores today, every one was PACKED with people trying to panic hoard. The grocery stores should be completely closed to the public at this point, and instead all groceries should be delivered, free of charge (and reimburse the grocery stores until this all blows over). That means people keep buying stuff, more jobs open up for delivery, and everyone gets what they need.\n\nSame should be done for restaurants, just close them for sit-down, convert over to delivery, use the wait staff to do the drops (with wages increased and supported temporarily by government funding). If a cook so much as sniffles, send them home with pay for 3 weeks (supported by government funding).\n\nSame with entertainment. Theaters should be closed right now (no way around that one, they'll likely need to be bailed out), and movie studios should be putting this stuff out on Disney+, Netflix, etc. It'll keep people chill while this blows over. Allow the studios to be very flexible with their books and call these movies a loss on taxes.\n\nBroadway closed? Set up streaming performances that you can pay to watch. It's not the same, but it's something to do, and it keeps at least some revenue coming in, and the actors working without being in a performance hall with 1000+ people.\n\nSame with any office work. If you're behind a computer for 50% or more of your day, your job should be converted to remote temporarily.\n\nThere are some jobs and functions that simply can't be done online, and that's fine. In those cases, keep them going. The point is to clear off as much of the traffic as possible to \"flatten the curve\", and we have a lot of technology to enable that.\n\nThis isn't going to be the last time we have to deal with something like this, so we might as well assume that we need plans for how to keep things going. Imagine if this was instead caused by germ warfare from a country like Russia...what would we do then?",

                            "comment": "I started out in MBS so I can give a bit of color here. The simple explanation: the bank sells the mortgage to fixed income investors so they make a profit on the origination fee, not the rate itself, unless they also service the loan. You don't need to be a mortgage servicer to originate a loan. So lower yields means lower mortgage rates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDetailed explanation: Mortgage rates aren't set by Treasury yields, but it is a very easily quotable instrument so a lot of people will use that. Mortgage rates (primary market) are effectively set by MBS bonds (secondary market) because a lot of lenders are essentially a conduit (technically not the correct word here but good enough) between the ultimate borrower and ultimate investor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgency MBS bonds have no credit risk but you have prepayment risk, which means that you own what is close to a Treasury bond plus short a call option. Imagine if you could invest in a callable Treasury bond, this would be close. In the near term, bond volatility has been incredibly high and as you are short an option, that reduces the price / increases the yield of agency MBS bonds. You don't want to buy a pool of mortgage-backed securities at 3% coupon if borrowers will refinance to 1.5% in a couple months. This explains why Treasury yields can fall but mortgage rates increase. But if we are in a prolonged low-yield environment and volatility mean reverts, the option cost will reduce and the excess spread of MBS over Treasuries should fall. Lower secondary market yields means that the primary market rates should fall as well.",

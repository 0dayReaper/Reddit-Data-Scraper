Unfortunately, the last 2 days including all the questions on the KR conf call totally killed all the upside basically. I'm punching my imaginary wall right now. \n\nThis isn't even a buying opportunity either. In my mind traditional supermarkets are morphing to something even worse than a retailer except for the fact that they're less cyclical. ",

Walmart's purchase of Jet.com also came with a complete overhaul of Walmart.com, a new online team lead by the Jet.com CEO who Walmart has placed a huge amount of faith in power in and he's definitely going to use it well. Bezos is pretty smart but he's not the smartest in the industry and he's not going to win now that the giant has pulled their heads out of their asses re: online retail. It's just not mathematically possible for him to beat them if they use their head-start resource advantage properly like they're starting to now. He likely knows this and a move like buying Whole Foods is Bezos and friends giving up on outright \"beating\" Walmart and such in the race, instead trying to forge a new corporate identity that can exist alongside the other giants and have its own particular identity. \n\nThis should definitely be a good price drop to buy Wal Mart on. \n\nAnd Dollar General is just profitable for free. I worked there last year, people that shop there aren't suddenly gonna have the money to start buying in enough bulk to offset shipping costs. The company's management structure seemed like a fucking mess looking from the bottom up, but the CEO himself is pretty good and it just doesn't take effort for them to make a profit in their niche. Nobody really wants to compete with them right now because competition would make the whole sector go from shitty-but-easily-profitable to just shitty and pointless to work in. I see zero chance of DG struggling in the next quarter. \n\nThis should definitely be a good price drop to buy DG on, but sell as soon as the oil price re-explosion starts to show signs of rearing its ugly head, because DG's market's economics are gonna change heavily when that happens. I give them a year before they start struggling. But they're still a good buy for now, they're probably going to rise some more before they hit those difficulties. Not a guaranteed investment like the Wal, but still a good one. ",

Think of this as one of those fresh food delivery services like Farm Box Direct, except they'll have the massive (comparatively) footprint of Whole Foods, with the logistical infrastructure of Amazon.\n\nIf they take this seriously, this could pretty quickly and massively disrupt the entire grocery industry. That's before you even start factoring in upcoming technology enablers like drone delivery, automated vehicle delivery, etc. They could come at this from so many technology angles in the future that it will be pretty hard for any incumbent players to really compete, because while it's easy for Amazon to buy a grocery chain, it's going to be essentially impossible for a grocery chain to buy an Amazon. For many grocery companies, their best bet is probably to just get acquired by Google or something.",

That's operating cost; it ignores the multi-million dollar installation costs. Hourly employees are going to be quite a bit cheaper for a while except perhaps at NY locations.\n\nIn NY the transaction overhead might be a worth while tradeoff to reclaim the space from the 50 checkout counters + 100 person line waiting to checkout. Together they occupy half a million per year in leased real-estate. Moving more product, reducing shrinkage,  and increasing customer volume (no lines, always fast) might make it work.",

That gallon bottle shipped 2nd day FedEx from I-don't-remember-where.  It was the only thing in the box.  The other 8-10 items shipped in three other boxes from three other locations, two of which were also FedEx 2-Day.  One was UPS Ground.\n\nI've been joking with friends that, if you hate Wal-Mart, the easiest way you can hurt them is to give them your (online) business.",

At worst, they would have been shipped UPS Ground.  Probably one or both boxes would have arrived via USPS.\n\nWal-Mart might have more distribution, but I feel Amazon has *better* distribution. \n\nAmazon is by no means perfect though.  The other day I got a roughly 10\"x6\"x6\" box that had nothing in it but a pack of four coin-cell batteries that I had ordered along with other things that arrived separately.  That was probably due to the lithium sticker the box had to have on it, but they could have used a padded envelope and saved on the dimensional weight.",

If I could order anything that my local WF carries, that would be a game changer for me. The nearest WF is not super convenient for me to get to and it's always a parking clusterfuck. I really only go to it if I'm preparing a fancy holiday dinner and need things like a natural unfrozen turkey, grass fed rib roast, etc.  I would shop there every week if it was more convenient.

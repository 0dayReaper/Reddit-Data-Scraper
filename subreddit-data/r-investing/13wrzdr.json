    "postText": "On Fidelity, I can buy CDs that are being sold by other people, and there are ones that expire in around a week. It also looks like they are being sold for below market price (99.2 instead of 100). \n\nAs far as I know, I could buy this and get a month's worth of yields in one week, but this seems too good to be true. This would make the annualized yield around 20%, so what's the catch?",

Now if you buy at less than 100 that can boost your YTM and is a loss for the seller, but you\u2019d have to calc the YTM to see what your actual annualized return is",

And you understand the min qty purchase required to get that rate, It is possible  a seller is simply selling at a discount to get out of a position and raise cash. In that instance, the return would be higher than normal. The interest will be paid based on the term and remains time. Meaning if it pays quarterly  for example, previous quarters (may) have already been paid in cash vs reinvested and you won't receive  that,just the last one I believe. Without knowing for certain, it doesn't  seem worth the gamble, especially  when there are 5.5%new issues  available.",

That doesn't pass the stink test, you must be missing something",

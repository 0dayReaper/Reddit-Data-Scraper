    "postText": "Title might be a bit confusing, so i apologize, but there is a picture here to help me convey my question. I made a post not long ago about using my companies financial advisor to start my investing journey [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13nw889/just\\_started\\_aggressively\\_investing\\_using\\_my/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13nw889/just_started_aggressively_investing_using_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nI learned a lot of stuff, got told i was being taken advantage of (high fees from my advisor), and did a lot more research since then. Vanguard and VTSAX/VOO were the main ones i kept hearing over and over. I tried to look into how these funds work but i still dont quite know enough. My main question is this...\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/p652iJI](https://imgur.com/a/HlJkqUY)\n\nIf i were to buy into either of these funds, i see there is a list of areas they split the money into (I think this is what this list shows at least) Is there any reason to buy into both? It seems that a lot of the areas they invest the money into are the same. I would like to buy into both to try and diversify a bit more but are the areas that are the same (Energy, Health Care, FInancials, Etc.) The same companies? IS there any reason NOT to buy into both, or is it fine just putting my money towards one of them either VOO or VTSAX?",

Instead of needing to create (and maintain) your own patchwork of funds, the single broad market index fund does all that work for you. \n\nSo just stick with VTSAX, maybe at a broad market international stock index  fund once you have enough saved to buy it, and then a broad market bond index fund as you get older",

Just stick with either one and you will be fine. \n\nIf you want to add a second ETF I would rather add some VT or VWO to get exposure to foreign stocks.",

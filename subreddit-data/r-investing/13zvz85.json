I have narrowed my search to five funds to choose from but I'm having trouble distinguishing them and deciding which to invest in. Here is the list (please let me know if I missed any):\n\nVOO \nQQQM\nSCHD\nVTSAX\nVTIAX\n\nI know I should not invest in all of these because there is probably a lot of overlap. Which funds would you all choose and why? \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: this is where I get confused as there are endless funds and endless recommendations",

The US is the world's largest and most dynamic economy and has been in that position for 120yrs.

Invest in the US and back your investment by advocating with political leadership for pro-economic-growth policies.  \n\nIf you're willing to take on a little more risk, then QQQM will probably be more volatile but deliver better returns over the long run.",

The period from 1970-1990 we got very bogged down by the increasing entitlements and business regulations propagated over the previous fifty years.  By the late 1970s, even Democrat Jimmy Carter recognized the over-regulation problems.\n\nBut look at it this way: how many first class entrepreneurs like Elon Musk dream of moving to France to chase their business dreams?  none.  They come to the US because it's here that they have the best chance of success.\n\nBut that's also why I said to advocate for growth-oriented policies.  US success depends on it's policies.  Overloading with entitlements and regulations will bring us back to the level of Europe.",

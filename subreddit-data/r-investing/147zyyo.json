    "postText": "Edit: title typo, meant to say traditional ira not roth \n\nIf my former employer's 401k has mediocre fund options and my new one has slightly better ones, but also offers an alternate option of doing a Schwab self-directed would I be better off rolling it into the self-directed or would a traditional roth make more sense for the rollover?\n\nAt the end of the day I want to be able to abandon the expensive underperforming funds and just put it into ETFs of my choosing. I was liking the idea of the roth because I can open it under the same broker as my other trading account and that felt more convenient.\n\nI also don't know how Schwab is, but I'm satisfied with my current brokerage.",

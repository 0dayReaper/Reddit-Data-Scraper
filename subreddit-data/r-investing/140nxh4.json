    "postText": "The interests in my EU country are quite low. For 30-40 year loan I could get about 3% interest rate.\n\nIsn't it a good idea to take that loan and put it in a diversified portfolio? The average return over those years will most probably be way above the interest rate, not to mention inflation.\n\nThere's always the possibility of the interest rate going up, but overall seems it will probably be worth it. And I could sell the stocks and repay the loan, unless the market has crashed bad.\n\nWhat am I missing\n\nUpdate: There are no capital gain taxes here",

So whatever you end up with, your net is that minus $455,000.\n\n$300,000 invested compounding at 3% is $737,000. Minus the loan costs, you end up $282,000 ahead at the end of it.\n\nAt 5%, your net is $885,000\n\nAt 7%, it's $1,980,000\n\nCompare to saving saving that $455,000 over 30 years instead:\n\n3%: $740,000\n\n5%: $1,000,000\n\n7%: $1,550,000\n\nSo unless you think you're going to get fantastic returns every year for 30 years, even accounting for safer investments near retirement, you're likely to end up with less money and more risk.",

So, if you can afford to loose 20k and want to pay that back over 30-40 years, I would not do that, because the risk reward isn\u2019t there. But if we\u2019re talking 2k over the next 4 weeks I say go for it. The return on that reward needs to be able to match the risk which is cash interest (25%) or else you are losing. Have a plan to pay back the loan, like excess money from your paycheck because you work a good job.",

Now that nobody seems to think that risk premia stay the same over time or that beta really does reflect everything that matters about risk in the stock market, it seems like there is no one way to calculate the cost of the capital anymore.

            "comment": "Theoretically, sure, and trading with leverage is not unusual... but 30 year loan has unique risks.\n\nFirst, most of the time when people trade with margin/leverage, it's for very short term trades. Margin rates are high, and the whole point of using a loan to capitalize on higher volume so you can get a meaningful profit in a very short time and avoid interest altogether.\n\nSecond, the usefulness of this loan changes dramatically when you have to pay it back every month. If you sell stocks to repay, you lose the compounding effect and risk selling at a loss month after month. If you use income to repay, your cash flow is diminished. In either case, you could be forced to sell at a loss to cover the monthly repayment.\n\nThird, since there is no \"sure thing\" in investing, the most you can do is reduce risk, and accept lower returns. You've set a 3% breakeven, so even if you want modest returns of 4-5%, you have to invest in assets that come with disproportionately high risk. You'd basically have to invest in the S&amp;P 500 and accept equities market risk to get the same payout as a risk-free 10 year US Treasury bond.\n\nThe only advantage in this scheme is that you're investing a big chunk of money up front, which helps get compounding interest snowball rolling quickly enough to offset the interest. But if that doesn't go to plan, you could be locking in major long term losses.",

                    "comment": "I think this answer covers a lot of the aspects.\nTo me, the two main challenges are a) the liquidity impact of having to repay the loan's interest AND principal and b) the risk of both the housing market and stock market crashing, which could leave you insolvent and maybe even forced to sell either house or investments at a loss.\n\nIn addition, you'll have cost to create the loan (banks, notary, state, etc). There will potentially also be cost to pay it back - particularly if it is fixed rate.\n\nNow that being said, many of the negative comments here seem to fail to acknowledge that anyone with a mortgage and investments are doing the same. The alternative would be to not invest and instead pay off the loan. So it's fairly common, just that your case you have to take a loan with the sole purpose of investing. Noone says you need to borrow the maximum amount possible.\n\nWhat further speaks for your suggestion is that you have no capital gains tax, and I would be surprised if you cannot deduct some of your loan cost in your income tax. Maybe you could also use pension schemes to get more deductibles. Depending on the income tax rate you have, this could be significant (but money is then tied up).\n\nRich people have been doing this for decades (and I can also tell you some horror stories from Spain in the post-financial crisis era).\n\nSo not all stupid, but risky. If you had asked a year ago when we had lower rates, it would have been easier to recommend a yes.\n\nUltimately, you seem to be financially strong. It's mainly a question of risk tolerance and the ability to bear potential losses.\n\nPersonally, I think rates will go up further and stocks will go down. I wouldn't do it now. But nobody knows.",

If the dollar weakens hugely after you buy vis a vis the euro that would eat into your returns big time. If you bought European stocks in euros you'd have lower risk- however European stocks haven't had the same long term return as the S&amp;P 500, especially since the GFC.",

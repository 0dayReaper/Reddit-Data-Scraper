    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI own a combination of ETFs, mutual funds and stocks, and it\u2019s tough to keep track of how much of a single stock I own across investments. I do a high level scan of it all myself every few months but it\u2019s tedious to look up the holdings of each fund, find the % the fund owns of a stock, find how much money I own in the stock indirectly through that fund, and do this for all other funds. \n\nI\u2019ve used the X Ray tool from Morningstar which is exactly what I\u2019m looking for- but I\u2019m not subscribed to that anymore and looking for an alternative. Currently use Fidelity as my brokerage, not sure if they have a tool like this. \n\nAny tips would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

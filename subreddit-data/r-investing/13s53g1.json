    "postText": "Hi,\n\n  \nI understand the wash sale rule for losses, but how does it apply for gains?\n\n  \nFor example, if I sell stock A for a $1000 loss, sell stock B for a $1000 gain, and then immediately buy back stock B on the same day, how much tax do I owe at the end of the year?\n\n  \nWould I be net neutral not have to pay capital gains on the appreciation of stock B? In other words, can I \"cash out\" my gains on a stock to offset my other losses but say invested on that same ticker? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Just to add to the other response. What you did in your scenario is desirable at the end of the tax year since, in the US, there is a limit on how much is deductible annually for cap losses. So there is such a thing as cap gains harvesting to limit the tax implications down the line. Realizing gain can also be desirable in certain situations but they are relatively niche.",

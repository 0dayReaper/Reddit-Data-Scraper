But it was generally known that bogle was pretty terrible at active investing.  Rumor is that Wellington actually removed him from their management teams because he was so bad.  Of course that ended well for everyone because he then went to start Vanguard which obviously revolutionized the industry but also funneled billions of AUM back to Wellington anyway.\n\nE: I can't find where at this point but he has expressed in no uncertain terms that he doesn't want to be remembered for investing, indexing, or even for Vanguard.  He wanted to be remembered for being a consumer advocate in the investment, and specifically in the retirement plan world. ",

That'd mean to be well diversified you'd have to have 2 of the best stocks in each sector if you wanted to go the individual stock route. This is before the Internet and how easily available material was. I imagine way less people than, those who didn't have a background in finance, were able to accurately analyze stocks.\n\nToday, theres plenty of books. If you knew *nothing* you could study from Investopedia and Udemy for free or low costs and become better equiped than most.\n\nIntroudicing his funds changed the game.\n\nThe introduction of ETFs made things even better. If nothing else, you could just sit your money in the S&amp;P, Nasdaq, long term treasuries, and international fund and be better off than most.\n\nSometimes i wonder why i just don't keep things simple for myself and and focus on VTI and QQQ. Thats about the best i'm gonna get!\n\n",

I got to spend 30 minutes talking with him one on one over breakfast. He convinced me I didn't need to invest overseas, that US companies do plenty of business overseas and therefore the American stock market captures much of the world's economy. That certainly worked in the 9 years since. Who knows going forward.\n\nI do note that Bogle ate bacon and eggs, to me, a heart attack survivor, a very unhealthy breakfast for someone with a heart transplant. But, hey, he had a younger man's heart. To live to 89 is a good run for any guy, especially one who had a heart transplant. \n\nRIP Jack Bogle, the Jesuit priest of finance.",

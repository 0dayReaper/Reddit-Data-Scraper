Especially when you consider inflation. \n\nI have my own money working for me in the market. I don't need my inheritance to survive, so I want to do something smart with it. \n\nShould I find a 4% inrest account? Put it in bonds? I'm open to any ideas aside from putting it in the market. Thanks.\n\nReally appreciate the answers. Though the fact this post is being heavily downvoted shows how many of you are jealous babies.",

            "comment": "&gt; ... so I want to do something smart with it.\n\nDepends an awful lot on what you consider 'smart'.\n\nIf beating inflation by fractions of a percent is smart, then the difference between CDs, or Bonds, or a Bank isn't going to mean more than maybe 200 $/year (inflation adjusted) if you choose the right one. Of course, you could be losing that much or more if you choose one that doesn't pace inflation.\n\nHave you maxed out your 401k, IRA, Roth IRA?  Buying the same instrument in a tax free (or tax deferred) account is clearly a big plus.\n\nFunding a 529 plan could be another good option. They're super flexible in terms of who can benefit,\n\nhttps://www.savingforcollege.com/article/who-is-a-member-of-the-family-of-a-529-plan-beneficiary\n\nAnother form of mostly tax free investing would be to set up a NIMCRUT. You get a tax write-off, the assets of the fund grow tax free, and someone you choose gets a periodic payout. The payout is taxed as regular income. The NIMCRUT has a 'make up' provision that allows you to not make payouts in bad years. Eventually, what's left over in the NIMCRUT goes to a charity of your choice.\n\nhttps://learn.valur.io/nimcrut/",

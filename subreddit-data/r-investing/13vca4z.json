    "postText": "Hi. My fianc\u00e9 made a large sum of money through trading options. We now want to invest a portion of that into a safe haven. \nWe are trying to evaluate if an investment of around 220k (\u20ac) into SPGI vs. Moodys / Synopsys vs. Cadence is the smarter way to make a ton of money over the next decade. \nWe were already comparing these businesses in terms of earnings and numbers and they seem really similar. \n\nWhich ones would you decide on and why? \nI know there are many of these comparisons but I\u2019d like to hear some opinions in 2023. \n\nThankful for any tips!",

Both are fantastic businesses, with a long history of great market performance (with low volatility too).  They are a duopoly in a critical business.  Don't try to outsmart the world by picking between them.  Bet on the industry and buy the virtual sure-thing of owning both.",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t speak about the second group, but S&amp;P Global and Moody\u2019s are powerful natural monopolies with very boring businesses. As long as western capitalism reigns and plenty of debt that needs to be refinanced exists, there will always be demand for credit ratings, which is the cream of the crop segment for both businesses. They have pricing power about 2% + inflation rate, take up a very small percentage of the total volume of money changing hands, and have relatively less exposure to R&amp;D costs and capital expenditure risks. Using any other credit ratings agency beside Fitch will result in nontrivial amount of additional capital costs. S&amp;P Global owns a lot of popular indices from which it derives high margin subscription revenue as well. Both businesses also have aggressive shareholder return policies. In the wake of the global financial crisis, they continue to draw lot of online flak regarding their accuracy , but it\u2019s likely they will remain toll gates for the foreseeable future. You can evaluate their overall accuracy across various financial instruments over the decades with their website annual investor material.",

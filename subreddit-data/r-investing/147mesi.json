    "postText": "I'm curious as to how stock prices of publicly traded stock rises/falls when the market is closed.  \n\nEx, Case: NKT, Danish cable manufacturer is doing a stock emission, offering stock options to shareholders. The options have been send out during the weekend, after the market closed. Now, when the market opened today, the stock price had fallen from 430 dkk to 400 dkk, approx 7.5%. How is it, the reduction happens instantly when the market opens, and how come the Danish stock exchange reports a rise of a few percent today (Monday), when the stock is down from close Friday? \n\nThanks in advance\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

I figured it might be related to aftermarket, now i know for sure:) \n\nDo you know how aftermarket trading takes place? Practically speaking - you need to connect a buyer and seller in a way that doesn't go through the ussual channels?",

What happens in the case that user A has a sell order for 10 shares at a price of 100$/share, and user B has a limit order to buy 20 shares at 100$/share?\n\nDo I even understand the principles of limit orders, the term is new to me.",

And brokers can also internalize the feature. This is a flag on an order to specify if all or none of the order can be filled. \n\nBy default - AON is not set. So in your example - unless the buyer sets the AON flag, the buyer gets what is called a partial fill of 10 shares.",

Fidelity doesn't provide services in Denmark afaik.\n\nIn the US - banks do not offer access to capital markets unless it's a holding bank and the services are offered through a broker-dealer subsidiary. \n\nI think that Fidelity was just an example.  \n\nPlease note that some of the comments in this post are very US centric.

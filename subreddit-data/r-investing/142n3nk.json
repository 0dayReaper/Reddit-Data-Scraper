    "postText": "As a passive investor majority of my investments are in form of Mutual Funds. However, even with that I've to admit that I've not been very disciplined and astute in monitoring my portfolio, and do it like once every 4-6 months, but have several SIP (Systematic (monthly) Investment Plans) running. Today I happened to review my portfolio and I feel that it is hightime I did some rejig in my MF portfolio. One of the large-cap MFs hasn't been performing well (consistently since 2yrs). It was already on my \"monitor hard\" list but I've made up my mind to move away from it. I have also identified a different large-cap MF which I'd like to have instead. Question then, what is the right approach to do this switch ? I can think of 2 distinct approaches, and a 3rd perhaps being the hybrid of the 2.\n\n\\- Approach-1: Start a Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) to start divesting on monthly (or even weekly) basis and reinvest the amount in the new MF. Here I could choose to keep the quantum of re-investment same as my monthly investment before (into the particular MF), or I could speed it up by being 2x-3x-5x per month.\n\n\\- Approach-2: Make a one-shot, move i.e. divest in first MF and move the entire sum into new MF as lump-sum investment.\n\nIn the country where I live, there are tax implications, where-in capital gains accrued over longer period have advantageous taxation, compared to capital gains accrued over short period. Thus the gains from most recent SIP investments would be taxed at higher rates. Given this, I could do the \"lumpsum\" treatment for the part of my investment that qualifies as long-term only.\n\nJust looking for some thoughts in the community on why someone would pick one approach over the other ?",

If Fund A provides 10% a year and Fund B provides 7% a year, then I would be earning 3% more a year by allocating all of my funds into Fund A. There is no point to keep your funds in an underperforming holding. It only reduces your overall return.",

            "comment": "I will preface this by saying that it is okay and normal to change your investment strategy. However, what you are describing sounds a bit like \u201cSell low, Buy high\u201d. After all, past performance is not an guarantee of future performance. I just want you to be sure of why you want to change your strategy and that it is ideally not just because the new fund has a better 1yr return than the old one.\n\nIf you are worried about tax implication with a sale then go assume these are not held in a tax advantaged account (like an IRA/HSA in the US) which would then lead me to ask why hold mutual funds over exchange traded funds?  MFs have more tax implications while you are holding them as compared to their ETF counterparts. \n\nLast, and to answer your actual question, I would say out of your two presented options the second would be best. You could also make sure to only sell those shares that are past the \u201clong-term\u201d threshold to reduce tax liability, but that will mean retaining the fund you want to get rid of for an extended period of time (up to 1 year in the US).",

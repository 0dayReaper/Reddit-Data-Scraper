It can vary depending on supply/demand. A stock like NVDA probably has very low borrow fees since it is not shorted very much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;How often would I have to pay my broker interest?\n\nBorrow fees accrue daily from settlement date to settlement date. Most brokers like TDA will charge monthly. \n\nIf you have a bearish outlook on NVDA - you can also explore other methods of taking a bearish position.   \n\nOther ways of fixed max loss positions include call credit spreads, long puts, and long put spreads. \n\nIf you have high conviction in your trade - you can also use synthetic short futures and variations. \n\nThere are other techniques but if you are unfamiliar with shorting and taking a bearish position - an inverse fund like others suggested is a fixed max loss option to start with.",

Most brokers for small accounts take the interest on the cash and pay the interest on the borrowing fees.  You could look into single stock futures since the spread between borrowing fees and cash means it is definitely worth it for you to short at the commercial rate rather than retail rate.",

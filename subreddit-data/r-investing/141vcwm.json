    "postText": "I've been trying to understand treasury stocks, and the effects of their reissuance under stock compensation plans on the balance sheet but am getting very confused.\n\nWhen a company repurchases stocks, the shareholder equity and asset sections decreases by the same amount (i.e Number of shares * Price at moment of purchase) because the stocks become a treasury stock which is considered contra-equity. So far so good.\n\nIt's when the the treasury stocks are issued under stock compensation plans that the whole thing doesn't make sense to me.\n\nI was specifically looking at Adobe Stock FY2017 Shareholder Equity section specifically(Page 57 and 60)\n https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReportArchive/a/NASDAQ_ADBE_2017.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCmOSlnq3_AhWOlP0HHQDRAdIQFnoECA0QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0C0BxZbmvuI0K0EHKJUF2P\n\n1) In its YoY  table for Shareholder Equity  it says 2 things contributed to it's APIC: \"Reissuance of Treasury Stock under stock compensation plan\" and \"Stock Based Compensation\". What is the difference between these 2 and why are their APICs so different(Stock based compensation gave 453 million while the other only 1.7 million? Isn't all stock compensated from Treasury stock?\n\n2) In the YoY table the reissuance has a negative effect on retained earnings but the stock based compensation doesn't?\n\n3)We know that when a company repurchases stocks both Assets and Equity goes down equally. However, when a company is issuing stocks as compensation plans to employees, the equity side of the balance sheet goes up(because shares outstanding increases) but does the asset side go up equally as well?\n\n4) Basically, it's the YoY table that I can't make sense of. It's tripping me up.\n\nThank you",

Look at pre 1968 Germany, they had a different patent system which actually fostered new novel drugs. It was only during the 40s-60s that the US system became the model it is now. Which is patenting the actual compound product, and not its process or something that lead to it. It turns out, as more and more data continues to roll in, it hugely disincentiviezes  novel research rather than the commonly touted encourages. ",

I worked for a 'consulting company' that ran essential parts of clinical trials for FDA approval.  \n\nThe process then, around the Millenium, is largely... legit.  The FDA drug approval process is exhaustive, to say the least, and a great deal of the company resources is spent on submitting, then re-submitting, drugs for approval.  It is a staggering process.  So *then*, I could understand Pharma's idea that they need to recoup cost.  Those costs are really, really big.  Billions big, thousands of jobs, including a lot of people I called friends.  \n\nBut, the consolidation in the market, which is inevitable, no Dr. Evil doing, just a process, naturally pushed more and more resources to, as you say, marketing and lobbying.  Those mergers required Federal approval across numerous nation-states.  Once the big Companies had resources invested in that lobbying, well, now they can do other things with it.  And their purpose *is* to provide value for their stockholders, either with profits, dividends, stock value, or any other way.  \n\n&gt; In this sense the basic research costs are socialized while the profits, increasingly breathtaking profits, are privatized.  \n\nMajor, major problem that is one I agree with the core Reddit ethic about (and that is rare!).  I pay State and Federal taxes, live next to a Major research University, one of the biggest on the planet, University of Michigan.  It's a State college, which means they have tax breaks and direct funding from the State.  But it costs $15k per semester for tuition alone.  The profits from the medical research are parlayed off to private companies and individuals.  *I* paid for that research!  \n\nJust rambling thoughts here.  \n\nThe problem is, a pan-national solution involves other nations, and those nations, including Germany, are often corrupt or in some way have a *stupid* set of solutions to problems which are now coming to light as actual problems for them.  So you get some EU, UN, or transnational proposal which boils down to \"We think the US is a bully so here are your penalties\".  So, we Americans naturally reject that (then are called stupid rednecks, which exacerbates the problem and confuses the conversation).  \n\nAnd no one will ever convince me that European drug manufacturers are in any way more ethical or that their system is better than the US's.  They are the original Dr Evil companies, they come from the big German chemical firms form the turn of the century, and are only rivalled in duplicity and corruption by a company like Thyssen or Krupp.  Slave labor.  Barons and stuff sitting on the Board.  Permanent, constitutional subsidies in a variety of nation-states... fucking system is a mess.  \n\nJust rambling here... this is a thorny one everyone kind of throws their hands up about every ten years or so because it's so intractable.

Hard to imagine even more players entering the space. \n\nThere's one aspect not very often seen, but the mergers done fervently in the past few years mostly in order to evade taxation, has been a big bust towards developing novel meds. Analysis has indicated that the number of new drug approvals during the past 60 years is correlated with the number of companies\nhttp://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v8/n12/full/nrd2961.html\n\n&gt;although mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry might have had a reasonable short-term business rationale, their impact on the R&amp;D of the organizations involved has been devastating.\n&gt;In major mergers today, not only are R&amp;D cuts made, but entire research sites are eliminated. Nowhere is this more evident than with Pfizer. Before 1999, Pfizer had never made a major acquisition. Over the next decade, it acquired three large companies \u2014 Warner-Lambert (in 2000), Pharmacia (in 2003) and Wyeth (in 2009) \u2014 and multiple smaller companies, such as Vicuron, Rinat and Esperion (Supplementary information S1 (figure)). Over this time frame, to meet its business objectives (a euphemism for raising its stock price) Pfizer closed numerous research sites in the United States, including those at Kalamazoo, Michigan (formerly a site for Upjohn), Ann Arbor, Michigan (formerly a site for Warner-Lambert) and Skokie, Illinois (formerly a site for Searle). It has also recently announced the closure of the Sandwich site in the UK. These sites housed thousands of scientists, and many major drugs \u2014 such as atorvastatin (Lipitor), amlodipine (Norvasc) and sildenafil (Viagra) \u2014 were discovered there. The same pattern has been observed after most of the mergers and acquisitions by other major pharmaceutical companies during the past decade.\n&gt;However, Pfizer now projects that in 2012 this figure will only be 11% (between US$6.5 and $7 billion). The extent of this decrease is further emphasized by comparison with the pre-merger R&amp;D expenses of Pfizer and Wyeth in 2008: $7.95 billion and $3.37 billion, respectively, and $11.3 billion in total. Other large pharmaceutical companies have announced similar cuts in recent years.\nhttp://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v10/n8/full/nrd3514.html\n\n\n\nOne thing the Europeans have going for them is NICE and IQWIG which is a decent second layer of approval to see if a drug is actually worth anything clinically for what it costs. \n\nAlltrials is working on methods to eliminate the administrative bloat in trials. \n\n",

I started there in the 90s.  The size of the data is large, but doesn't mean anything because of the vagaries of compression, collations, etc.  \n\n*Physically*, when the FDA used to require paper data sets, the long-time employees talk about them loading the trials data into semi trailers, sometimes more than one.  So about 10-40 tons of a paper per drug.  Just on the statistical data-sets.  Not to mention the rest.  Am I wary of regulation?  Absolutely.  Drugs have been buried due to regulation and the staggering cost of bringing a drug to market if it's marginal the FDA will approve it.  Especially when a cancer drug has an impact on a small portion of patients with a specific type of cancer that is not exactly common.  There *are* chemicals that exist that could, dramatically put as we always see on the News, save the lives of hundreds of children a year.  Well, no one is going to fund that cost, not even when they can get Insurance companies to agree to $20k per dose.  \n\nI'm pretty wary about any European extra-layer regulation for that reason.  \n\nThere are actually a huge number of 'biotech' startups concerned with single-issue drugs, procedures, or devices, funded by Angels.  But, the Angel investment, A B, and C funding-rounds and all the rest of the VC, Startup nonsense has turned that into a complete shit-show, as we  *regularly* see on the news now.  \n\n",

Yes, the price hikes are ridiculous, but its a direct effect of the creation of billing practices designed durinng the creation and subsequent modifications of the managed health care model. \n\nEdited to add, I upvoted your comment because I like the discussion, but I want to downvote you because of your misappropriation of u/martinshkreli 's name.

My joints ache, I generally feel like my gut isnt right, and I'm somewhat lethargic. I think we fundamentally misunderstand what's causing so many people to have gastric issues, but once you get on these PPIs, you can forget getting off of them. Every gastro I've seen looks at me like I'm crazy and then goes on to say there's not really any serious studies looking at the problem now because PPIs \"work so well.\" Quit taking them for 3 days, deal with the rebound and then tell me if this is \"working well.\" I now live in constant fear of running out.\n\nMy guess? Antibiotics are causing this. I think they majorly screw you up inside and then these issues emerge. Researchers have already proven that ulcers are caused by bacteria. Fecal transplants have surprisingly shown major success in all sorts of applications for lower GI issues. But nope, let's keep using these PPIs, because \"they work.\"",

And a smaller PBM trying to compete can't do much because they lack the negotiation size to be a big player.\n\nThere's also a perverse incentive with drug prices because the PBM gets a cut of its money from the rebate it negotiates...so the higher the price of a drug, the bigger the rebate it can negotiate and the more it pockets.\n\nIt definitely seems like a market failure to me.\n",

But it doesn't need to pass that extra $10 to the plan, it can just pass over $1 or $2 above what the small PBM would offer and keep the rest of that for itself.

Hospitals themselves charge through the ass for simple generic otc medication like acetaminophen from their own internal pharmacies.  They're usually gouged by their suppliers and warehousing companies and there are cases where manufacturers gouge themselves either through mergers that give them a captive market or FDA granted production monopolies for 'quality control'.  Additionally the US in general foots a massive percentage of research and profit costs due to other countries either having national health systems that flat out won't cover drugs that are marginal improvements or just ignore IP wholesale like India.\n\n\nA lot of this happens with generic and widely used drugs that have been off patent for literally decades and has nothing to do with evergreening, IP law and high costs for new and novel drugs, but it tends to reduced into 'big pharma is evil' in the public dialogue.  \n\nIt's a complex and multifaceted problem with lots of bad actors and the chief reason it doesn't get dealt with is because there's pretty aggressive advertising and lobbying of the public itself (specifically seniors) every time legislation that actually reign some of this in come to the table.  The fact of the matter is that the US is graying and seniors flat out consume massive amounts of healthcare resources and if they aren't on board for something it isn't going to change.  The most powerful lobby in the US isn't Apple, Pfizer or Exxon it's the AARP.",

Are you aware that they fly patients to testify infront of congress to lobby that a drug be approved? This is just politicization of the FDA. \n\nThat is just outright lies. But don't forget that despite our best judgments, things can still go wrong. And we get the analysis wrong. For instance a drug which lowered blood cholesterol really well, ended up actually killing lots of people upon further study. \n\n&gt;The doxazosin arm was stopped early (in March 2000) due to a 25 percent higher rate of combined CVD and a two-fold higher rate of heart failure compared to the diuretic arm. The results were published in the April 19, 2000, JAMA.\nhttps://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/allhat/qckref.htm\n\n\nOh and cancer? \nIressa, cancer drug by AstraZeneca for third line option, was shown to be effective by surrogate test of reducing size of tumor by 10%, in 139 patients. They pushed for rushed approval. It did not occur before other trial data came in. The drug showed no benefit in real survival outcome, nor even in tumor size reduction, in 2,000 patients.  But 12,000  were on the drug in an \"expanded acess programs\" and fought for approval. AstraZeneca even funded sending some patients to attend FDA advisory committee. The drug, which didn't work,was approved. This was confirmed in yet another large study. Another drug came out for third line and was shown to be effective. Iressa staid on the market.  \n\n\nI implore you to not stick your head in the sand on this issue. \n\nHow about psych drugs? FDA analysis of 100,000 patients. Only 4% got tricyclics. Half of patients had depression. 50% responded to the active drug. 40% responded to placebo.  \n\n\nCochrane review of depression in general practice: 58% responded to drug while 46% responded on a placebo. Although this itself is biased due to using only published trials, which are far more likely to be positive.  \n\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4272b1-01-FDA.pdf \n\n\nThe more conservative estimates from the present analysis found that differences between antidepressants and active placebos were small. This suggests that unblinding effects may inflate the efficacy of antidepressants in trials using inert placebos. \n\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003012.pub2/abstract;jsessionid=16EB14542D3DA2DB45F37A4EDC5BECCA.f03t03 \n\n\n\n\n\n",

There are advantages to a single-payer system and there are disadvantages (reduced development, fewer benefits, higher taxes required for welfare costs, government control can be problematic at times).\n\nIn fact, many drug companies use the US market as a way to justify developing medicines that wouldn't have been developed otherwise. Costs are often so high that reimbursement needs to follow (around 50% of all drugs in the world are developed in the US).\n\nMarketing is a requirement for pharma so that it can receive more money from its products which in turn funds R&amp;D which in turn means newer, better medicines for everyone.\nYour claim that 'the whole point of marketing is to undermine evidence-based medicine' is stupid. It is illegal for a drug company to market their products on anything other than real scientific evidence. It does happen, but when it does, the fines can be [enormous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_pharmaceutical_settlements) and hence the law acts as a huge deterrent to what you claim 'the whole point is' - i.e. it isn't the whole point, just like the whole point of advertising your car is not to make other cars look bad, but to make yours look better.\n\nPatent laws are complex - are there issues? Absolutely there are. But the higher prices while on patent, and steep price declines that occur in the market for patented drugs once its patent expires - is the efficient and expected result that balances the sometimes conflicting needs to fund the large expenses of developing new innovative drugs for tomorrow and making drugs as affordable as possible today.\n\nFraud also exists, as do a couple of the other things you mentioned, of course. This is a $500 billion dollar industry. Not every single agent is going to behave perfectly, there will be bad apples.\n\nBut to paint the pharma industry in one broad stroke as the epitome of evil, as it seems you have done, is horrifically inaccurate.\n\nPharma has saved millions of lives, extended the human life span, improved the quality of many lives, has been a boon to the US and world economy and contributed extraordinary science to the sphere of human knowledge.

We subsidize other nations costs in this way. \n\n&gt;Marketing is a requirement for pharma\n\nIn which countries? You once again seem to have a faint notion of what  is going on but you're stuck in 101 basics and refuse to graduate to 201. Your claim against evidence based medicine is asinine and ignorant. Drugs, unlike any other consumer product has an objective answer. Marketing exists for no reason other the to pervert the evidence based decision making in medicine.  \nSo we pay for products with a huge uplift in price to cover their marketing budget, and that money is then spent on distorting Evidence based practice, which makes our decisions unnecessarily expensive and less effective. \n\nPharma marketing is a way for the public and patients to pay for Pharma marketers to produce biased information, which distorts data, and makes treatments less effective and more expensive. \n\nBut don't believe me. There's lots of research out there you can dive into. \n\n\nProfessor sir Michael rawlins was head of NICE and noted that some of the cost of drugs is due to marketing. Around 1/4 of the price for some is marketing. \n\nDrug adverts aren't truthful in their claims. 1/2 of claims in ads are supported by the trials those ads referenced. 1/2 of trials referenced were of high quality. Even in the leading journals like JAMA NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE, less than 1/2 the ads referenced a high quality trial that supported the claims. \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20103825/\nSystematic review \nhttp://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006350\n\nPharm reps 278\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876413/?report=classic\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/17/pharmaceuticals.nhs?client=safari\n\n&gt;The other thing we have to pay for is the costs of marketing. Marketing costs generally are about twice the spend on research and development.' Advertising to patients was forbidden in Britain, but widespread in the US, and some of that marketing cost was built into European drug prices, Rawlins said.\n\n\n&gt;which in turn funds R&amp;amp;amp;amp;D which in turn means newer, better medicines for everyone.\n\nPure ignorance. The in fact proves it. See the effects in mna. \n\n\n&gt;hence the law acts as a huge deterrent\n\nNo it's not. It happens all the time. This is a classic case where they make more money doing illegal things and just lay the fines if caught. Remember me saying regulators don't do much of their job? Well there's about 4 reps for every doctor. I've met hundreds of them. They wink wink and gush around the \"rules\" all the time. \n\n&gt;is the efficient and expected result\n\nYou're out of your element. Efficient? The current system disincentivizes novel meds. Again, see Germany pre 1968. \n\n&gt;steep price declines that occur in the market for patented drugs once its patent expires\n\nOnce again you're making assumptions for how things should be, not as they are. \n\n&gt;Generic drug prices rising with competition. \nhttp://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mylan-price-hikes-20160830-snap-story.html\n\nRampant collusion mate. \n\n&gt;Not every single agent is going to behave perfectly, there will be bad apples.\n\nEvery single agent? Did you miss the part where 1/2 of ALL trials go missing? This isn't every single little thing, it's 1/2 of all medical trial research. Perhaps you'd do better with an example? \n\nAntidepressant papers  published over two decades of approved drugs were looked at.  \u000b\u000b12500 patients in 74 trials, with 38 trials showing positive resluts for new drugs.  \u000b\u000b37/38 + were published. \n\n\u000b\n\u000b3/34 not positive were published.  \u000b\n\u000b11 of the negative trials were in the literature, but were written as if the drug was a success!  \n\u000b\u000bSo reality is 38+ and 37-, while the literature showed 48+ and 3- trials. Absurd!  \u000b\n\n\u000b&gt;Pharma has saved millions of lives, extended the human life span, improved the quality of many lives, has been a boon to the US and world economy and contributed extraordinary science to the sphere of human knowledge. To argue otherwise is senseless.\n\nNo ones arguing otherwise. If I pull a knife out of your back while slipping my hand into your wallet and poison into your water, it appears you're just going to say \"THANK You!\" \n\nAll you have to do is read a few of the sources. Your perceptions are just not reality. \n\n",

It's just the accumulation of 40 years of business practices. Turning \"science\" trials into an assembly line to approve drugs. From the first papers given from PR firms to journalists on the need for a drug (see female sexual dysfunction fiasco) to the ghost writing from PR marketing firms that actually write and publish the trials papers, sometimes before the data is in. \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23585648/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240099/\n\nhttp://www.radstats.org.uk/conf2007/Blumsohn.htm\n\nhttp://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b5293\n\n&gt;Regulators are there to stop and punish those that do. \n\nRegulators that don't regulate? More harm is usually done when new regulations are introduced because then regulators claim an accomplishment and pharma claims they must abide by strict regulations. What they don't say is that the regulations aren't enforced. See 20% compliance with FDA ACT of 2007. \n\n&gt;it's more of a sign of a government failing at it's job than it is a reflection of the industry itself\n\nSomething we need to make sure is fixed. Maybe a start is enforcing the regulations there already. This isn't just gov either. Journals have claimed to not publish any trials that aren't registered, something not done. (A problem because 1/2 of all trials go missing. Which of those do you think they are, the positive or negative ones? If 1/2 of a data set goes missing that's a bad data set or fraud. And yet on our entire scale of medicine that's what we have) \n\nWe can certainly blame pharma. I'm not sure why you're putting all blame on gov. Pharma is the one actually doing highly unethical things and fraud. This is a serious issue and not something we should be sticking our heads in the sands about. ",

The price for a decades-old antibiotic called doxycycline, for example, jumped from $20 for a bottle of 500 pills in October 2013 to more than $1,800 in April 2014. The ongoing attorneys general investigation began in 2014, according to the complaint, and has \"uncovered evidence of a broad, well-coordinated and long-running series of schemes.\" \n\"It's always suspicious when you see dramatic increases in price in areas where there's really no market protection, either through patents or something else,\" said Dana Goldman, director of the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at the University of Southern California.\nExecutives from Heritage, a New Jersey company described as the \"principal architect and ringleader of the conspiracies,\" sought out competitors and got them to \"agree to raise prices for a large number of generic drugs,\" according to the complaint.\nA Heritage saleswoman from Minnesota would allegedly organize the Girls Nights Out, Swanson said. The gatherings were sometimes called \"women in the industry\" meetings, as if the aspiring executives intended to mentor each other on the secrets to getting ahead in a man's world. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., had asked Heritage for details about doxycycline's price increase in 2014. In a letter to the company released Friday, they noted that Heritage never sent the information. When asked about the drug's price increase, an attorney for Heritage told Cummings and Sanders that \"Heritage has not seen any significant price increases\" for doxycycline in the U.S.\nhttp://www.dailynews.com/health/20161231/where-did-drug-prices-start-rising-posh-dinners-girls-night-out-probe-alleges\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Ursodiol is a generic that has been sold for decades. It was available for a list price as low as 45 cents a capsule until May 2014 when one of the firms \u2014\u00a0Lannett Co. \u2014 raised its price per pill to $5.10. Lannett\u2019s competitors quickly followed with their own price increases, with most offering the drug for about $5 a capsule\n\u201cWhat did they do,\u00a0put cocaine inside it?\u201d asked Ken Solar, who lives with his wife. Lannett executives have told shareholders that the\u00a0U.S. Justice Department\u00a0is investigating the company\u2019s pricing practices. Most Medicare patients were shielded from the rise in ursodiol\u2019s price rise until this year. Solar said his insurer, Coventry, which is owned by\u00a0Aetna, changed the classification of ursodiol from a Tier 2 generic medicine, for which patients pay $9 for each prescription, to Tier 4, which includes mostly expensive specialty drugs. Under Solar\u2019s plan, beneficiaries must pay 50% of a\u00a0Tier 4 medicine\u2019s price, shifting far more of the cost to the patient. Walt Cherniak, an Aetna spokesman, said, \u201cWe moved it to a higher tier because of the rising price of the drug.\u201d\nhttp://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-medicare-drug-costs-20161123-story.html\n\n&gt;\u201cBy entering into unlawful agreements to fix prices and allocate customers, these two executives sought to enrich themselves at the expense of sick and vulnerable individuals who rely upon access to generic pharmaceuticals as a more affordable alternative to brand-name medicines,\u201d said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent Snyder of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division. \u201cThese charges are an important step in correcting that injustice and in ensuring that generic pharmaceutical companies compete vigorously to provide these essential products at a price set by the market, not by collusion.\u201d https://consumerist.com/2016/12/14/former-pharma-execs-face-felony-charges-for-generic-drug-price-fixing/\n\n\n\n",

Everyone points the fingers at each other... either it's the pharmacy, the manufacturer or the insurance companies. No one can pay for $1500 for a months worth of name brand meds. But if you get generic you only have to pay $5 but you are going to miss that one certain ingredient that could make your whole world better. I fight with insurances all day about paying for the med. but then they tell the doctor what meds the patient has to try before they can approve what the doctor (who btw has been a psych doc for over 40 years) patient should take. \n\nEven I talked to a drug rep and they said pharmacies get more money if they push the generic drug. This is why Walgreens always pushes the generic drug. \n\nI feel for these families who have to pay for doctor visits and meds that cost so much. We try to get copay card out or also feel trials out... but we can only do that so much. Just these year I've signed up 50 families with assistance programs through the manufacturer companies. It's very upsetting see how many people can't afford meds for what they really need. ",

Basically if a medication is too expensive to afford even after the Medicare or insurance picks up nearly all of the tab, the drug company will donate to a charity which can pay that copay for the patient, granting the company big dough. The directing of money from the charity to the specific drug the company makes is something which is not supposed to happen(wink wink). \n",

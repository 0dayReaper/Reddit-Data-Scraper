Is there something that shouldn't be there?",

You want to make sure you aren't getting fucked by useless fees to fund managers. There should be a lot of people here that can recommend funds with low expense ratios.\n\nThe Lord Abbett fund I believe is LHYCX and the expense ratio is 1.52%, which is high. You're paying for active management of the fund. That doesn't mean it's necessarily the wrong move to invest in it though. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that you can just go with these recommendations for now and then slowly shift to other investments as you yourself become more educated on investing. It isn't a race.\n\nAnd also, think hard about wealth preservation right now. There are a lot of macroeconomic risk factors in play and simply getting through the next year with your money intact might actually be the best move.",

Rough income, expenses, and current balances would suffice. You also mentioned you are now the caretaker of a 14yr old, please include rough details for that as well (e.g., are you covering their living expenses? College? Helping them buy their first house? Etc.)\n\nIn general, there are no circumstances where I would invest in actively managed funds with high expense ratios. Passive investing yields higher returns, has lower cost (so you keep more of your returns), and is also more tax efficient.",

This tells me that his/her investment options are limited and is not providing the most objective opinion. There are so many tools that can be used such as ETF, Structured Notes, etc. No mention of them.\n\nI would not allocate close to 70% of your money into fixed income at this time because the interest rate is likely to continue moving higher. Central Banks in US and Canada have both indicated that they want to keep the rates as they are or keep increasing them to tame inflation. There is an inverse relationship between interest rate and bond prices. When rates move up, the bond price moves down. You having 70% of your money in bonds, means that portion is going down. So, I wouldn't invest so much into bonds right now. \n\nI would say keep 50% in 1-year term deposit and earn a decent interest rate. Wait and see if there the recession occurs during this time. If so, the markets come down and you have 50% of cash available to purchase at discount.",

    "postText": "&gt; Paul Morina, the principal of Paulsboro, New Jersey, High School, is listed in financial records as the president, CEO, CFO and more at a Nevada-incorporated company whose stock is trading at levels that give it a valuation more than $100 million.\n\n&gt; That\u2019s an oddly high valuation because the company, Hometown International, owns a delicatessen \u2014 and only one small delicatessen \u2014 in Paulsboro, where the Morina-coached high school wrestling team frequently wins state championships. The company has disclosed that it has shareholders based in China\u2019s Macau territory.\n\n&gt;The shop, Your Hometown Deli, did just $35,000 in sales \u2014 combined \u2014 over the past two years, according to Hometown International\u2019s annual report, filed March 26 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/15/hometown-international-nj-deli-owner-worth-millions-in-stock.html",

I'll update you.\n\nUpdate Tuesday 4/20: [I went and got a taylor ham, egg, &amp; cheese sandwich for myself and an italian sub for my SO](https://imgur.com/a/XJtIWm8).\n\nI pulled into the lot right around 11 AM when they open. Three cops were standing outside talking to each other. The was a small news crew across the street setting up equipment. I walked in, small crew of a young guy and two older women. It reminded me of my high school job at my town grill. They were extremely nice and personable. My sub came up pretty quick and had to wait a minute for the breakfast sandwich since the grill was still turning on. \n\nTaylor ham: NJ staple breakfast food. I ordered it as a \"pork roll, egg, &amp; cheese\" since I was in South NJ. Roll was nice, eggs were cooked perfect, they used white American cheese which I liked. Negatives: they didn't slice it in half and didn't ask me if I wanted \"salt, pepper, ketchup\" which is the standard question you get while ordering one usually.\n\nItalian sub: My SO said that the bread was nice, good size, great ratio of ingredients, neatly made, and had the perfect amount of oil &amp; vinegar to keep the sandwich from being dry but also not soggy.\n\nTotal was $14 and some change. Overall, I'd say it was pretty good.",

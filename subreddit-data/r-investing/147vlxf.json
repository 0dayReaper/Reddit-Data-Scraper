Stocks don\u2019t all end up at the same spot 10 years down the line - some go up a lot, some go to zero.\n\nHis strategy - invest in companies and jump out at 15% - only makes sense if all stocks are bound to return to norm, aka stocks that are down must go back up, and stocks that are up must come down .   But that\u2019s not how things actually work - Apple will never return to its 10 year ago valuations, it\u2019ll have like a 1 P/E.  And Bed and Bath and Beyond will never recover.",

You invest it in Netflix or even worst a bad stock and it tanks.. so what happened to your account?  It went down and the great trade that made you money is now a loser.  While if you held Tesla and it holds or gains very little; you are still good.  \n\nThis scenario happens a lot.

I traded in and out making small gains the whole time. When it crashed at the beginning of COVID I decided to go all in. I think it was under 500 pre-splits. I was already a little nervous putting *all* my money in it and my accountant talked up Exxon so I sold and bought that. Then TSLA went up. And up. I said ok I messed up, I'll wait for the correction. No correction. Just kept going up to what, 7x run? Correction didn't come until I lost out on like 2mil of gains. I said I'm freaking done trading. I'm holding my buys unless they see another scenario like that where I'm sure they're going to correct and I better take some gains. I probably should switch back though, I doubt that's ever happening again. I had like 2x gain and held as it crashed into red for a good year there. Currently at 180 cost average. I doubt it'll rampage to 600-800 again... But I swear if I take some gains it freaking will. So I may as well hold.",

And ideally that idea shouldn't be \"Because Reddit/any kind of social media (creator) said ...\".\n\nHaving that idea should also give you an expectation in terms of company performance and stock price performance. Now if you are up 15% and you re-evaluate the work you did on the company and find that your assumptions still hold true, why sell?If you find that your assumptions were wrong and that the price shouldn't be where it is or shouldn't go above where it is, that would be an indicator to sell. But in that case it doesn't matter if you are up 5, 15, 30% or down 10 or 20%.\n\nBasically, decision making should be based on the comparison of the work you've done and the assumptions you've made vs. how things actually played out and what the outlook based on that performance is rather than the number in your portfolio. (Provided you don't have any urgent expenses, need for the money or a position you absolutely want to rotate the money into because your level of confidence is much higher there)\n\nSome of the big investors, I believe it was Peter Lynch, also talked about this:we often make the mistake of cutting wins and letting losses run when it should be the other way around - we should let our winners run while cutting our losses.\n\nAs with any generalisation, caution is advised here and what I wrote above should be kept in mind. But the core of the statement is true. And it's an easy mistake to make. We let our losers run because we hope for a turnaround, we take our winners early because we want to secure the win and are afraid of a turnaround and a drop. It's psychology. But it's something that hurts us.\n\nAnd it is something I would probably abide by if you are actually \"playing\" with individual stocks and treating them like a casino. Unless you get into a play where you know it's just about who's the biggest idiot and the last one to get in the scheme - which I would STRONGLY advise against; greater fool plays are risky and well and truly gambling rather than investing.But if you ever happened to find yourself in such a scheme, that would be the instance where you take a small win and run rather than letting greed take over and eventually falling deep.  \n\n\nOne more thing I'll leave you with: Even if you sell, it's not an \"All or Nothing\". Selling less than 100% of a position is viable (well, if your position is large enough so the cost of selling doesn't matter, that is; if you have 200$ in a position and a selling order costs you 5$, selling half the position at +15% isn't exactly viable)",

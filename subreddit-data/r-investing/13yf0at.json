    "postText": "Being a passive investor with a general lack of time and skill, I thought I'd try a newsletter, where they spoon feed you when to buy and sell.  Having read the Motley Fool, and seen Jim Cramer, I know there's a lot of bad advice out there, so I went to Hulbert's ratings (he tracks newsletter performance) and expertly hit the sort button on the Returns column and picked the one at the top, The Prudent Speculator, which has a 14% average (key word) annual return since 1980.  I signed up for their newsletter (around $30/mo) and invested about $1M in all the stocks in their main portfolio at the same ratios they do.\n\nThe past year and a half since I did this have been rough, and I know everyone can have a bad day, so I've been waiting it out.  But I became impatient and noticed that they don't generally publish their annual returns.  After digging a bit I learned that their founder, a guy by the name of Al Frank was considered to be a good investor and he racked up better than average returns until his death in 2002.  Since then, their returns have been at or below the S&amp;P 500.\n\nSo basically, people are impressed with their high return rate, and you think they must know what they are doing since they've been doing it for over 40 years, but turns out they are averaging in their less than stellar returns over the past 20 years into the overall number, and they still look like geniuses.  \n\nEventually the math will work against them but for now, I got suckered.  What's your experience with newsletters?",

I subscribed to 2 newsletter at the time, not going to name them because I can't attest to the quality of it now. \n\nMy goals at the time was to invest in only dividend paying stocks cause I want to retire with having my living expenses paid out by the dividends. One of the newsletter tracked the dividend aristocrats and the other one had a score of dividend stocks. Basically if both newsletter at the time recommend a stock I would invest in it. They are owned and made by different people so if both people recommend the same stock, pretty good odds. \n\nThe issue with this means that I didn't invest in any growth stocks at all, which at the time didn't matter because of my investment goal. It worked, because the stocks were mostly blue chip dividend paying stocks, the price didn't dip that much if at all and I didn't care much about stock fluctuation because I was in it for the long game. \n\nI stopped doing that now I have 80% in Total Market Index and S&amp;P500, 20% fun money into whatever. I stopped because dividend pay and growth is painfully slow. It was the beginning of my career so I was basically getting paid less than 10$ a year. I would revisit this strategy after I'm close to/or retire, now I need the growth.",

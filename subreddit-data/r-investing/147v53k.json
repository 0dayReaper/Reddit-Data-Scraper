    "postText": "Last year there was a post asking what folks were doing to profit from the current/upcoming recession on Hacker News: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211)\n\nI replied ([https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751)) that I purchased some pandemic stocks, which I started doing in April 2022. Most of my purchasing was through summer 2022, but I've bought others more recently, like Carvana on the dip in December (which luckily popped since it became a meme stock), as well as Meta, Amazon and Google on the dips in October. The most recent was Allbirds on the dip in March since I had just purchased the shoes and they quickly became my favorite.\n\nOverall, I'm up 36%, but as you can imagine a few winners (which I luckily have larger stakes in) make up for the losers. My target timeline is \\~3 years, and we could still see a deeper recession from a hard landing, so I plan to post more annual updates.\n\nThere were multiple lots of some stocks, so I've summarized each with the overall unrealized gain/loss so far as of this morning:\n\n* Affirm: -11.33%\n* Amazon: +25.25%\n* Allbirds: +9.43%\n* Coinbase: -34.32%\n* Carvana: +306.5%\n* Google: +29.35%\n* Meta: +170.89%\n* Cloudflare: +14.35%\n* Netflix: +97.08%\n* Peloton: -54.61%\n* Roblox: +25.14%\n* Shopify: +39.26%\n* Snapchat: +3.21%\n* Snowflake: +11.14%\n* Unity: +8.91%\n\n**Some commentary**\n\nIt's hard to convey how much of a roller coaster the the last 12 months have been, with some pretty large negative swings that I just had to watch and not react to. There are likely more to come, especially since it seems a lot of the potential good news is already priced in.\n\nInterestingly, in that post I mentioned Peloton was one I regretted almost instantly, and is now my worst performer by far. Unfortunately, greed got the best of me and I caught that falling knife buying a few times as the stock dropped further. I was hoping they would get rid of the excess inventory, improve distribution and double down on subscriptions to turn things around, but that hasn't materialized. Maybe it still will, or they get acquired.\n\nDespite the strong gains, I still feel Shopify (improved focus, strong brand), Netflix (new ad tier, other new streaming services struggling and likely to go back to content), and Meta (improved targeting post privacy changes + AI opportunities) still have good upside potential.\n\nI also really like Microsoft due to their enterprise moat and opportunities with AI, but their stock never had the correction the other stocks did and that was the scent I was chasing at the time (right or wrong). But long-term, I also wonder if AI will negate the need for human productivity software since the AI can just do it and review/edit mode requires less bloat (e.g. video with Final Cut Pro vs. TikTok, or images with Photoshop vs. Instagram). I wouldn't doubt if we see an AI-native productivity suite that doesn't just integrate AI, but predicated on simplfy reviewing AI generated content.\n\nI'm disappointed to have missed Nvidia (up 3X since October) since I used to own it and have been watching it since the crypto bust created excess inventory and a predictable dip, then the AI trend led to the recovery. The valuation feels rich, but could easily grow into it given the trajectory of AI, unless the hyperscalers make their own chips.\n\nPerhaps counterintuitively, it seems it's more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts than financial analysts/stock pickers since, at the end of the day, you need to make your own decisions about the fundamentals and prospects of the business. Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but by definition backward looking while valuation is forward looking.\n\nI'm curious to see how these perform if the US enters a broader recession in the next 18 months. I don't plan to sell unless something catastrophic happens and I see a better opportunity to shift to.",

Then started buying on the bad earnings reports that I felt were overcorrections when I was familiar with the underlying businesses.\n\nThe layoffs will help profitability, improvements in AI mean they may not need to hire as many back and interest rates should go down as inflation eases to drive up valuations again. So I'm optimistic there's more upside.",

It wasn't called covid yet but people in China were getting sick by the droves, large areas were being quarantined, and more long before it hit here.

The Chinese government was shutting down cellphone footage as fast as they could but too much was leaking out because the disease was spreading so fast and they couldn't handle it.",

Also, one of the analysts I read at the time gave me insight into what was going on in China.\n\nI didn't know it'd lead to the world shutting down, but I knew it was going to be bad. \"Bad\" only needs to be sufficient to rattle markets, though it wa much worse than that, so my timeing saved me from the crash.\n\nThis doesn't mean I'm briliant though. If I was, I would have immediately bought the dip then rode it all the way up, but I didn't. I was more risk averse at that time because we had small kids and my wife's business (retail) had shut down for months. Much uncertainty. But that's where the post above picks back up with easing into FAANG and SPY before selling again, then buying the dips over the last year.",

Sure by taking profit you reduce your upside but also limit the drawdown which is important since it'll be quite tough to pick the top.\nAnd even if this was a complete new bull market you'd wanna see a rotation into other stuff instead of a few stocks carrying the whole indices. So even if you wanna play the bull case you'd wanna cut the positions that have performed well and partly rotate into undervalued stuff.

I bought on the dip, so the lower the price the lower conviction you need.\n\nOverall, I'd say I'd be bullish for a few reasons:\n\n* They are a juggernaut, no real competitors\n* Shopify recently pulled out of logistics by selling that arm to Flexport, so Amazon has even less competition\n* Everything is shifting to AI and that has to run somewhere -- datacenter scale computer. AWS is the largest hypserscaler, thus gets economiesof scale, especially if they build their own chips\n* There are also more opportunities coming with AI we can't imagine yet, the biggest will benefit most\n* They seem to be leaning out with the layoffs, so will drive more profitability\n\nThose are some reasons I'm bullish on it. Whether I'd buy it today is another question. I look for opportunities, which means I generally buy on corrections. So, I form an opinion on the future of the company, then when I see an overcorrection I have enough conviction to make to contrarian bet. That means more reading, listetning and waiting than buying. An ambush predator I guess lol.",

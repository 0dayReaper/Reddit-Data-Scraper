I see that\u2019s still the case today, despite the US side performing much better. \n\nMy dad has always said to go heavy in US because those companies have foreign exposure anyway. Your thoughts? 65/35 still the way to go?",

Overall, they still act like their home stock markets. Capturing how foreign stock markets behave can both help increase returns and reduce volatility compared to 100% in any one county (even the US).\n\nEconomies and stock markets also aren't the same thing and in some ways may be negatively correlated.\n\nWhy should one ignore Toyota but hold GM? Why ignore Samsung but hold Apple?",

Oat that to figure out your ratios.\n\nSome people are fine with large caps for their US coverage,  personally I'd always like proper exposure to the extended market.\n\nCheck the contents of the Fidelity International Index, it might be FSPSX, which is developed markets only, no emerging. If that's the case, you may consider either adding an emerging fund somewhere, or ignoring ex-US in the work plan and going heavy on it in some other account to make up for that.",

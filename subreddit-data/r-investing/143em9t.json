Even what school they went to plays a part, albeit a minor one.\n\nNext up is looking for video interviews or even commercials with them. How do they respond to questions about their livelihood? How do they carry themselves. They are or will be figureheads of the company so they have to have at least SOME sense on-screen.\n\nAnd finally I try to find *real* contributions they've made in the past. This could be research papers, methodologies published, teams led, or anything that has direct and tangible results.\n\nIt's not short work most of the time, but that also plays into it. If a board member actually is reputable than this information will be relatively easy to find and not in the shadows.",

There is definitely a balance to be struck - experience is valuable, and people are unlikely to get it at the board level until later in their careers. However, I think older board members are less likely to be forward looking and trying to identify trends that are coming 5-10 years down the line.

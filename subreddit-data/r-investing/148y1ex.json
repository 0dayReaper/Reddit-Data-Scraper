Oldest one is 8 middle one is 5 and smallest one is 6 months old. I put a restriction till 25 years old. Is it gonna be good enough for them by the time they graduate from college ?",

The UTMA accounts are irrevocable gifts to the minor that must be transferred to them when they\u2019re 18. No restrictions on what they can use those funds for. 529s can be used for K-12 schooling and trade schools in addition to traditional college/higher education. With secure Act 2.0 529 funds will also be eligible to fund Roth contributions (starting in 2024). Additionally the your kid can pass the 529 funds to a sibling if they dont go to college or have a qualified expense to use the funds on\nEdit: The UTMA is still great to use for building a nest egg for kids but it\u2019s not the most tax efficient method to save for education",

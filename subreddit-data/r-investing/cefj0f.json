Someone from China bought it despite having never seen it in person.  Oh and she paid 100% cash.  10% over asking price.  Oh and she waived inspections.  Sorry!\"\n\nSo this new development is fine by me.\n\nEdit: A few years ago, Vancouver created a foreign buyer's tax to combat this -  [https://globalnews.ca/news/3636579/vancouver-foreign-homebuyers-tax-one-year-anniversary/](https://globalnews.ca/news/3636579/vancouver-foreign-homebuyers-tax-one-year-anniversary/)",

It is just one method of capital flight as they know the government constantly devalues their money.\n\nWhen Trump announced 25% tariffs in China, Bitcoin jumped out of its long bear trend with a huge force as many they were fleeing out by Bitcoin.\n\nAnother way is to withdraw a bunch of cash in Shenzhen and travel to a Hong Kong branch.",

Existing homeowners were getting WAY too much for their home (nobody needs to profit that much on a residence), and the Chinese buyers were simply letting the houses sit there vacant. That is not healthy for a community, those houses should be filled with young families that will spend 20 years in the community, paying taxes, going to local businesses, supporting the schools, etc.\n\nThis is a VERY good thing to happen.\n\n**EDIT**: Thanks for the gold! Now maybe I can afford a down-payment on a house!",

We're not talking 6,000 shares of the latest tech company, we're talking homes that people should be living in for 20 years, with their kids growing up. It's INCREDIBLY unhealthy for homes to just sit vacant in a community.\n\nIf you think it's protectionist, go try to buy a home for yourself, a US citizen, in the middle of China and see how that goes. At the very least, the US should have reciprocal laws about property ownership that impose whatever rules are in place in the buyer's country on their intent to purchase abroad.",

Until enough people show up to either offer the desirable things or enough people show up and create demand there's just no competing and no incentive to go T2 unless you have children or want to be frugal.\n\nWhen I moved to New Orleans a few years ago I did it to be frugal. And, yeah, I saved a lot of money. But I was also bored as shit.",

It sounds like you are describing a rural texas oil town by your description but in reality these places can be amazing. And no one is forcing people to move but I'm really not sympathetic to anyone that forgoes complete financial prudence to be near the met.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have mostly spent time in T2 cities and they can be every bit as fun as T1 plus you dont have to work until you die. If you are Ibanking in nyc of course i get it, but if you are in a field that can perform in another city its in your best financial interest to do so.",

If you build your list purely by data, let's say population or wealth, it doesn't work. Seattle, or San Francisco, which to me are T1 cities, have smaller populations than Houston, Texas, which to me is a T2 (despite being one of the biggest cities in the country).\n\nTo me, a Tier 1 city is typically one people outside of the country have heard of. New York. Boston. SF. LA. Seattle. Chicago. When I visited Paris and told people (a cab driver and a worker at a bakery) I was from New Orleans, I shit you not, they had never heard of it. I had to say, \"Louis Armstrong? Jazz?\" and that gave them sort of a light bulb...\n\nA Tier 1 city has everything you expect. Density of population, residential and commercial spaces in close proximity. Insane traffic. Wealth. The aforementioned things to do. Tier 2 cities tend to be more spread out, like Houston or Atlanta (but, again, LA is insanely spread out so you can't judge cities by density, either), and they tend to have sleepier commercial activity (most stores or restaurants downtown shut down around 5-6 or are only open for lunch).\n\n They tend to have some wealth but not crazy wealth. Charlotte, NC is flush with bank money (I think). Houston and Dallas with energy. Miami with tourism and probably drugs, I dunno. Someone mentioned Boise, I think Boise has been home to a tech scene for a long time but it hasn't ever put the city on much of a map. Oddly I was driving cross country and went past Boise and it looks absolutely miniscule, like a small town that's really proud of having a couple 50 story buildings in it. Not hating, just an example of a place having a bigger reputation than it should.\n\nYou might find this book helpful: [The Death and Life of Great American Cities, by Jane Jacobs.](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Great-American-Cities/dp/067974195X) I read this early on while hunting for a place to live because I wanted to really understand how to recognize a great city without having to visit many of them. I ended up traveling a lot anyway but her work is very insightful. She was instrumental in how Toronto evolved (she even had an impact on New York I believe) and I briefly lived in a neighborhood with her fingerprints all over it, that was essentially her model neighborhood. A perfect blend of medium density residential (some single family homes next to 20-30 unit apartment buildings a few blocks deep) astride a commercial corridor for groceries and entertainment -- [the neighborhood is called \"The Annex\", check it out on Google Street view here](https://www.google.com/maps/@43.6659543,-79.407487,3a,63.9y,191.25h,90.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sJZzWDxHNOtmpEj6SVnrSAg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192). The neighborhood has a mix of students, professors, bankers, artists, etc. Or, it had -- I'm sure it is gentrified like crazy by now.\n\nA Tier 1 city is also a city that is insanely expensive to live in. In San Francisco I rented a 330 sq. ft. apartment in a truly awful neighborhood for $1650/month five years ago. That was a great price back then...in New Orleans I had a 1300 sq. ft. house and was paying the equivalent of $800/month in mortgage. I paid the place off just before I moved away from there, something I never thought I'd be able to do in my lifetime. It is something I will never likely be able to do in a Tier 1 city.\n\nSo...probably more of an answer than you wanted or expected, and probably not a very helpful one. My suggestion is to think about what is important to you and find a place that has that. Do you love the outdoors? Denver/Boulder, Portland OR, Seattle, etc. are great cities with that. Do you want to spend tons of time at a beach? San Diego is pretty affordable (for California) and you get that. Do you like hiking and camping? Plenty of places to do that in texas. Find a subreddit here and ask the locals :)",

All of the Trump tax cuts were designed to benefit REITs.  The economy is pinned on property as an investment that must always increase in value.  At some point this becomes at odds with American values because only the already wealthy class (with a large crossover to the older generations) benefits from this.  \n\nAs far as is can tell there is no popularly acceptable mechanism to counteract this other than something like Elisabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax, which is bound to be supremely toxic to the very class it targets and who conveniently happens to have the legal weapons they need to counteract it thanks to Citizens United.

It's when unemployment goes way up and house prices crash at the same time that people get screwed on a massive scale.

There are way too many families starting out now in the US who can't afford their first house, it's a sign of a very sick country when so many are in that position.",

Intrinsic value can be defined simply: It is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life.\"\n\nDividends are the only way you can take cash \"out of a business\", short of liquidation.",

That means you technically own part of the companies assets and its cash flow. (even though you can't access it) In a publicly traded company whoever owns 51% can decide the course of that company. You can pool together with other owners, and as long as you have 51% you can decide the path that company takes. That is super powerful. You can decide where and when the company spends its money. You can choose to not spend money on certain things. For example, If your group of 51% owners dont like a certain political party you can run a campaign against them. You can fund their political opponents. This is just one of countless examples of how corporations and company's exert their power and influence. Power and influence is a very valuable thing. especially in today's society.",

If they aren\u2019t paying dividends, they are hoarding cash or investing it in value creation or buying back shares.\n\nIf they are hoarding cash then whoever has 49% of the company has 49% of the cash. If they are investing it whoever has 49% of the company has 49% of the enhanced value of whatever, new ip, capital assets, etc. \n\nTheoretically the investments can be bad (value destruction), and yes the shares would tank if the market agreed the investments are bad, but that isn\u2019t unique in this scenario, lots of companies make bad bets.\n\nI think the fundamental premise needs to be expanded a little bit. Companies that don\u2019t pay dividends, don\u2019t buy back shares, and don\u2019t invest in value creation opportunities will see their value shrink to hard assets-liabilities on the balance sheet very quickly. The dividends is only one piece.\n\nYou gotta remember the controlling stakeholders are in it to make money $$. They are going to get theirs one way or another, buybacks, dividends, keeping their share price high and borrowing against it. Other shareholders will benefit the same.",

Yes, motivation for wanting that ownership is (or at least should be) based on an expectation of some portion of the company's profits being passed your way. At least eventually, anyway.\n\nEven if a company isn't currently paying dividends or doing buybacks, there is an expectation of future transfers of cash in some way. Even without a clear expectation, owning the stock gives you access to that transfer if it were to occur in the future.\n\nThere is no way to 100% guarantee that dividends/buybacks/etc will never happen. A company like Google can get away without doing this because of rapid growth. The rapidly increasing value of hypothetical future dividends/buybacks cancels out the lack of real dividends/buybacks today. If that changes, it can easily force the hand of google (or any company) into doing dividends/buybacks to keep the stock attractive.\n\nOn top of this, you seem to think that the founder ownership is something that will never change. I would argue that if this became a true, genuine obstacle to the companies share price growth, it would change.\n\nSo in short, nothing you've said really matters.",

At some point their growth will slow and they'll have to give dividends to keep investors happy.\n\nAlso, I find it interesting these companies with business models that involve plowing everything into growth.  At some point investors will demand some money back and when that happens the business model will weaken.  If they can't plow everything into growth then they may lose their moat.  Apple and Microsoft have been successful in giving some dividends back while keeping their moat strong.  I'm not sure all of these high growth tech companies will have a similar happy story.  For example i'm skeptical that the logging/metrics cloud solutions will be as successful as investors seem to think.  There's lots of competition.",

A stock is a financial asset. Outside the theoretical possibility of controlling the company (which, let's face it, will never happen for you or me), there is one purpose, and one purpose alone to hold a financial asset like a share - cashflow. Either now, or in the future.\n\nWithout cashflow, a stock is glorified bitcoin, whose only value comes from the willingness of another fool to pay a higher price for it.",

The price might not be 0 due to speculation or similar reasons, but the monetary worth would be non-existent.\n\nThat said, this szenario is only hypothetical, since in the real world at some point the cash would be distributed, one way or another.",

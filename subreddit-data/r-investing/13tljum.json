    "postText": "As we all know, Nvidia jumped 25% in a day on Thursday, one of the [largest single day](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-25/nvidia-nvda-on-track-for-record-219-billion-surge-in-market-value) market cap gains in history. Now up ~175% YTD, in a market that has rallied strongly since the start of the year, with AI being the hot new thing, there is talks of Nvidia (and AI in general) being a bubble. That Nvidia is overvalued.\n\nBut I want to point this out: despite the 25% jump in price this week, NVDA shares actually got **cheaper** on a forward P/E basis.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xPQR2OF.png\n\nPrior to the report, it was traded at ~60x forward earnings. After the report, it trades at ~50x. And that 50x is only ~1 standard deviation away from it's 5 year average range.\n\nThis relative valuation holds for pretty much every metric\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/iMejuuf.png\n\nRelative to it's peers, Nvidia, despite the massive single day jump, doesn't trade much more than above it's historical average.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/4nP2u9w.png\n\nWhy is this? Because in hindsight, analyst expectations were somehow *too low*.\n\nOne year forward revenue grew from ~$30B to ~$40B, a 33% jump\n\nTwo year forward revenue went from ~$37B to ~$50B, a 35% jump\n\nOne year forward EPS went from ~$4.55 to ~$7, a 55% jump\n\nTwo year forward EPS went from ~$6.50 to ~$9.60, a 46% jump\n\n2025 operating profit expectations a week ago were $16.6B. After reporting, now $27B\n\nForward gross margins went from 67.5% to 70.5%\n\nForward free cash flow went from $11.4B to $20.4B\n\nI know it sounds like beating a dead horse here, but Nvidia just gave guidance that is them screaming that a transformational change is incoming.\n\nWill the stock continue to keep going up every day? Of course not. But the calls of Nvidia being overvalued based simply on price action is ignoring the fundamental shift.",

If you had a full DCF model you'd see something like the consensus projecting 30% top line growth, and the implied growth being something like 25% growth.  This would be an increase from say 20% before the jump.  Your job is to determine if the newly implied  25% growth seems greedy by your estimates, and if it is then you should sell the stock.",

Nvidia and it's peers trade at a premium to the market multiple. And even with the big jump on Thursday, they trade at a relative to it's peer multiple that is cheaper than the prior multiple.\n\nI'm not saying go out and buy Nvidia or anything. Just that the term \"overvalued\" is relative to some valuation. If you think Nvidia is overvalued after a 25% jump and 175% YTD increase, then you had to have also thought it was more overvalued recently prior to it and has been overvalued for years. That is fine! But it has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 over the past 5-10years, so clearly the market has been buying the multiple.",

                            "comment": "While I understand your argument talking about relative multiples, I think it's too simplistic and therefore incorrect.  How are you supposed to know whether a company is worth 25x PE or 35x PE?  They're both just arbitrary numbers from the layman's perspective.  You need to have a full DCF model to understand what's really being priced in at 25x and 35x to therefore know whether you should be buying or selling.  And if you don't have one, then you're actually just a momentum buyer/seller following technical rules.  Not saying that can't work in the short run, but how are you supposed to know when something is actually overvalued?  You actually  can't.  Instead you just fooled yourself into thinking you know how to define value from one arbitrary number following historical patterns.\n\nAlso the market does trade on a consensus principal, because what do you think the NTM PE is based on?  It's the sell side consensus EPS estimates.  Also if the buyside is pricing in a 'margin of safety', then that means they think the sell side is getting greedy and therefore don't agree with the magnitude of the increase I'm expectations.",

AI, especially ML, require a lot of computing power to work on non trivial problems. The advent of AWS means that a researcher doesn\u2019t need to have exclusive access to a large data center. \n2) HADOOP and parallel computing advances. This made it easier to build horizontally scalable algorithms that take advantage of cloud computing \n3) GPUs. (i.e. NVDA) AI requires a lot  of hard computation and the GPUs enable that. \n4) Open Source software development. All the software building blocks are available and free. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching these converge over the last 5 years. I think the LLMs (Chat GPT, etc)are the tipping point that starts the gold rush.",

Like it only took the open source community about two months to figure out how to run them on a Raspberry Pi and train a Lora on Macbook Air.

Nvidia is gonna make a lot of sales and still be a market leader in GPUs but will it sustain the growth expected right now?",

Keep in mind TSLA's story is not over yet. \n\nIt seems on reddit, people aren't comfortable with investing in a stock based on high profits in the future. \n\nPeople seem to be more comfortable investing in mature companies where profits aren't going to grow massively but trade in 20s PE and 30s PE seems to be accepted for companies with moderate growth.\n\nI think stocks trading at \"low valuations\" can give people a false sense of security. \n\nI can't fault people for investing in INTC when it was trading at 10 PE for the last 5 years, but we can see that what looks like a \"value\" stock can be extremely risky.\n\nI believe the market is reasonably efficient most of the time, and we can see there was good reason the market valued INTC at 10 PE.",

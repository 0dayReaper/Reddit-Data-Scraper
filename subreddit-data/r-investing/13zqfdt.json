    "postText": "Does anyone know how to find the number of T-bills that were auctioned off for previous auctions?   I looked on the TreasuryDirect website, and for each past auction they give the price and investment rate, but I can't find the quantity sold anywhere.   \n\nFor this Monday's 13 week T-Bill auction, the TreasuryDirect site says they're offering a quantity of  65 billion.  I'm curious how this compares to past offerings, considering that the debt limit impasse has been resolved, but the Treasury needs cash immediately.",

            "comment": "&gt;I'm curious how this compares to past offerings\n\nLast week's was 63 billion. You can see all of the announcements and compare the offering amounts on the treasurydirect website\n\nhttps://treasurydirect.gov/auctions/announcements-data-results/announcement-results-press-releases/auction-results/#competitive\n\nMy guess is they aren't just going to dump over a $Trillion worth of t-bills on the market in a single week's auction. They don't need the entire amount all at once. Also the treasury general account gets replenished with tax revenue in 2 weeks, so that gives them some breathing room and they can spread things out quite a bit.",

I needed to click one more link.   \n\nLooks like your guess is correct.  Monday's auction for 13-week T-Bills is only for $2 billion more from the previous week (I guess 'only' should probably be in quotes).",

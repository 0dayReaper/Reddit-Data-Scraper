    "postText": "I am managing some temporary excess liquidity for a business and investing in a cashable GIC is a good option for us.\n\nRBC offers a Prime-Linked GIC, which I understand to be a variable rate linked to whatever happens to RBC prime. As of today, Prime Rate at RBC is 6.70% and the GIC pays 4.25%. Therefore, you can pretty much infer it's as a \"prime minus 2.45%\" variable rate.\n\nBut when I was on the phone with RBC Investments, they told me that the rate does not actually follow prime. The rate won't change \"if it moves only a little bit up, like 0.25%\". So I asked, \"is the GIC rate prime minus 2.45% or is it some other factor for calculation?\"\n\nTurns out no one can answer this question for me. The person on the phone couldn't find anyone who could answer it either. Then I went looking for terms and conditions and \"fine print\". There is nothing about it on the public website, on the private investment page and you can't find any information before or after purchasing the GIC (so far).\n\nThe only thing I can find is this:\n\n&gt;The rate of interest on Interest Rate-Linked GICs is calculated based on a discount from the RBC prime interest rate. The RBC prime interest rate is a reference rate for determining interest rates on Canadian dollar commercial loans in Canada and is subject to change. The RBC prime interest rate can be found at rbcroyalbank.com/rates/prime.html. You may obtain the current interest rate applicable to your Interest Rate-Linked GIC by signing into Online or Mobile Banking, by making inquiries at your local branch, or by calling us at 1-888-903-0419.\n\nI have requested the full legal disclosure and terms and conditions so I can read the fine print, but I'm actually a bit shocked that no one could answer or disclose what the discount rate is and whether or not it too is variable. I'm concerned I can't find out more of what I'm buying prior to buying it. I only need to \"agree\" verbally that I want to purchase a GIC and it's done.\n\nI have asked them to send me the full prospectus or legal terms and conditions. We'll see if they show up.\n\nTLDR: RBC won't tell me whether their Prime-Linked GIC has a static discount or a variable discount.",

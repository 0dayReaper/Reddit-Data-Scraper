    "postText": "Mortgage bonds are pretty straight forward.  \n\nHome loans are given to home buyers, home buyers pay interest, mortgage debt is sort of \u201csecured\u201d because of the value of the home.   If the prospective buyer defaults on the loan, you still have the value of the house.    Investors looking for an opportunity may invest into mortgage bonds to make money, presumably on the interest paid by the home buyers. \n\n\nAre there also bonds that are based on cash loans to individual people? \n\nI\u2019ve been getting a lot of spam calls lately, I just don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re so motivated to \u201crelieve\u201d the tiny bit of debt I have.",

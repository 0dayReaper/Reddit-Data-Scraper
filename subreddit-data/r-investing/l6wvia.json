Please use this thread to discuss/complain/etc.\n\nE: Some rumblings saying it is only a restriction for pre-market and that RH users will be able to buy on open.\n\nE2: If you were able to buy on RH after open please drop me a reply here.\n\nE3: Thank you for the replies. Need to keep this locked to spare my inbox.\n\nE4: 2:27pm and it looks like RH and a few other brokerages are still not allowing investors to buy certain stocks. We are also still dealing with a lot of spam submissions and so will continue to keep the spam filter set to all for the time being.

I transferred two weeks ago and still don't have access to the cash in my account and can't transfer it out.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Make sure people know this!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Edit: if you transfer the WHOLE account you can\u2019t do jack with any of it. You can partial transfer securities and only those you transfer will be locked up. Just don\u2019t transfer short-term plays.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Edit 2: Thanks for all the love! I\u2019ve done all I can do in all the threads I saw when I posted this one. If you see people asking for advice on brokers or starting threads with news, PLEASE SHARE THIS INFO. I\u2019m going back to work soon and can\u2019t be town crier much longer. \u2694\ufe0f  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Edit 3: I\u2019m getting shit for saying it could take two weeks. There *are* laws on the books regarding the actual transfer once initiated. That doesn\u2019t mean anything if the new broker (who has to initiate the transfer) doesn\u2019t start that transfer soon enough. Plus this whole fiasco is because brokers are pulling shady shit. This is not financial advice and is all anecdotal from my nightmare transferring out of RH. Do what you want.",

As you sell and RH positions, transfer those funds to the new broker. This keeps you liquid while not losing any value on positions in better spots than their current rates. Also- this will keep you from paying the $75 (so I hear) transfer fee and it lets you make your moves in the mean time on the new platform",

We\u2019re proud to have created a platform that has helped everyday people, from all backgrounds, shape their financial futures and invest for the long term. \n\n&gt;We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary. In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG. We also raised margin requirements for certain securities.\n\n&gt;Amid significant market volatility, it\u2019s important as ever that we help customers stay informed. That\u2019s why we\u2019re committed to providing people with educational resources. We recently revamped and expanded Robinhood Learn to help people take advantage of the hundreds of financial resources we offer and educate themselves, including how to make sense of a volatile market. In 2020, more than 3.2 million people read our articles through Robinhood Learn.\n\n&gt;We\u2019re committed to helping our customers navigate this uncertainty. We fundamentally believe that everyone should have access to financial markets. We\u2019re humbled to have helped many people invest in the markets for the first time. And we\u2019re determined to provide new and experienced investors with the tools and resources to help them invest responsibly for their long-term financial futures. \n\nI have always thought they had garbage communication skills, and did shit jobs of explaining/excusing past fuck ups.  But this is a completely different level of low effort spin.  \"We\u2019re committed to helping our customers navigate this uncertainty. We fundamentally believe that everyone should have access to financial markets. \"  So we're going to go ahead and not let you have access to these financial markets though. \n\nSay what y'all will about the major brokers, but I don't see Fidelity and Schwab preventing people from buying.  As far as they're concerned if you buy at $500 and the stock drops to $8 that's your problem.  Which is how it should be.",

They have specifically targeted stocks of the companies GameStop (GME), BlackBerry (BB), and AMC (AMC). They have removed the ability for their users to buy the stock and are only allowing their users to perform sell actions with regard to the security. Removing the ability to buy a stock while retaining only the ability to sell it with no explanation is not only manipulation of the stock on a technical level (if nobody can buy the price by definition cannot go up) but also on a psychological level as investors begin to panic sell as they see such strange actions being taken by their trusted brokers with no explanation aside from vague warnings of increased risk from market volatility.",

I would put \"normal\" fidelity customer service at a similar tier.\n\nWhen I was learning options trading, their trade desk was probably one of my best teachers - taking time to walk me through every aspect of a trade, possible exits, what I would see on both their website and on their app so nothing would be unexpected.\n\nCompare that to TDA who literally told me \"we don't need your business\" and called me a liar about what things were applied for when I opened my account, even though I had freaking snapshots showing I was right and they were wrong.\n\nIf I could have fidelity + ThinkorSwim I would be sooooo happy.",

Transfers can take 5-15 days, and the squeeze could happen in that time period, but RH could also prevent trades during the squeeze claiming volatility. That said, you could sell stock for cash and withdraw and buy into an account on another platform (but frankly, don't take my advice as I'm not sure):\n\n&gt;It takes two business days for Robinhood to fully settle a transaction. Therefore, funds from a sale transaction would be available for withdrawal on the third day after a trade.",

Personally I'm not going to suggest brokerages that did this when anyone asks for brokerage recommendations on here in the future. Not that I really recommended RH for ages anyways, but apparently going forward it's Fidelity and Etrade when people ask I guess.\n\nYou're talking about the head of the Nasdaq saying that trading in situations like GME should be paused so that pros can \"recalibrate?\" When my investments toilet, can I get a trade halt? \n\nAs others have noted, this basically confirms a lot of what WSB have been saying. \n\nIs this some attempt for firms to try to \"protect\" people? Some people will end up losing big in this whole thing and that's unfortunate, but even if so, can't start stopping trading (what's the rules-based exact reason why RH is not allowing trading in these names?) because once you do it it's a slippery slope - what becomes, \"too much, gotta stop trading\"?\n\nI tell people on here that you're going to make mistakes and you have to learn from your errors and over time you hopefully evolve into a better investor. Apparently, when major funds make real mistakes, they don't have to learn from their mistakes, they yell for the ref to halt the game. When this GME squeeze is over (and it will be at some point - it isn't going to infinity), some people are going to be the bagholders and that's unfortunate but my question is, when GME reverses and there's volatility to the downside, will the same brokerages halt trading in these names again or no?\n\nWhether you are for what WSB did or not, I think everyone can agree that this \"rules for me but not for thee.\"  And maybe that's the way things are going to be and people have to adapt, but it's still pretty dismaying.\n\nIf this somehow shows how broken the system is (i don't think it's going to cause some sort of market crash, it will stop sooner than later), then that was going to happen eventually anyways.\n\nEdited because high and holy crap, some errors.\n\nEDIT: LOL. Apparently in March of 2016, Robinhood Tweeted, \"Let the people trade.\" https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp/status/712708069369782272",

The real scary thing is that the more measured play would be to just...let people have this. It's an extreme outlier that doesn't matter in the long run (and it's not like WSB are going to take all the money).  Some people will make money, some will lose. World goes on.\n\nWhat's really dismaying is that people don't even feel like they need to throw the \"little guy\" a bone. There seems to be a seething resentment at the very possibility of a hedge fund getting played (when, again, many bandwaggoners will lose) by retail investors using online knowledge and that it can't be allowed even though it poses no threat in reality.",

This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them. \n\nWe retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules \"to protect\" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price.

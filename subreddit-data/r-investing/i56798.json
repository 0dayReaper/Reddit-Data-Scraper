The wechat ban is going to be much more complicated.\n\nThe executive order appears to include a ban on any financial transaction with Tencent.  Tencent investments include reddit.",

WeChat is owned by a publicly traded Chinese company.  boith of these situations present various revenue risks and upsides for various public companies.  So discussion around that certainly belongs here.\n\nYour thoughts on Trump, Biden, China, Russia, various political ideologies, who's going to win the upcoming election, the state of data collection, weather or not this constitutes fascism, or your general thoughts on how terrible corporations are don't belong here.  They belong in /r/politics, /r/worldnews, or really whatever other subreddit you'd like to go to.\n\n33 people have been banned so far in this thread.  I'm not sure if anyone here will ever come to understand that the mod team is very serious about the rules on politics, but in the mean time we will continue banning people.",

More recently:\n\n&gt;**Auto revoke app permissions:** Android 11 DP3 has introduced a new option to automatically revoke permissions such as camera, location, and more, from apps that haven\u2019t been used for a while. This new setting can be turned on if you think you\u2019re not going to be actively using an app after a few months\n\n&gt;**Enhanced one-time permissions:** You know how in Android 10 you can tell apps to grab your location, microphone, or camera data only while the app is open? Now, the OS can let you approve those permissions just a single time and will revoke the permission later.\n\nhttps://www.androidauthority.com/android-11-features-1085228/",

Remember the 2016 election, where Facebook allowed its user data to be given to Cambridge Analytica psychological warfare political operatives for creating disruptions, divisions and anxiety in targeted election demographical segments in some states?  The fact that US companies have been abusing social media data and no one has done anything to stop it, is why anti-China conspiracy theorists are able to worry about China\u2019s rising social media apps. The \u201cdata leakage\u201d is impossible to contain as any just about any kind of data can be used to profile and psychologically target social media.\n\n&gt; I don\u2019t get why these aggressive reactionary measures continue to be the answer.\n\nAlso, this is Hoover-style trade protectionism on the part of Trump, and these \u201caggressive reactionary measures\u201d are just as likely to plunge the US into a great depression in the same way that Hoover\u2019s did, given the circumstances we are in with coronavirus and our diminishing ability to make our own goods and compete globally.\n\nEdit: I got banned for this comment. Apparently, discussing Trump\u2019s trade protectionism and its parallels to Hoover\u2019s that drove us into the Great Depression, is \u201cunnecessary politicization\u201d \u2014 note that even if I were \u2018politicizing\u2019 Trump\u2019s disruptions of trade, analysts believe that he is engaging in these trade disruptions for political purposes to begin with.

This is without factoring how much the price of goods will rise due to wage laws in the US being much more pro-employee than China.\n\nNot to mention all those American companies that heavily rely on Chinese supply chains.\n\nJust because China doesn\u2019t allow American companies to penetrate its market, doesn\u2019t mean that America and American companies doesn\u2019t have a lot to lose by damaging trade relations with China.\n\n(Edit: should add that I\u2019m not pro/anti China or USA for that matter, just a citizen of a smaller country caught in the middle)",

You could eat food, buy grocery, shop for expensive skin care products, buy plane tickets etc , all with wechat pay ,as long as you have RMB loaded or have a RMB card linked to it. So technically, you don't even need to have any US dollars with you while traveling in the states. \n\nThe impact on economy might be trivial, but this means a payment method had been created which makes avoiding US dollar possible while doing business.\n\n Say, a French company that felt the pain of Alstom was doing business with a Chinese company in the US, and they happen to have abundant RMB in the bank,so they made their payment in RMB through wechat. This threatens the monopoly status of the US dollars.\n\nThe Federal Reserve had been printing alot of money and will be printing even more, all those money need to go somewhere. So apps such as wechat pay ,which makes it possible for other countries to do business without US dollar ,have to go.",

Even services like Dropbox and Box don't work in China.\n\nThat's because the Chinese government has some crazy draconian laws that applies to *all* companies, foreign and domestic. FB/Google/Twitter decided they don't want to comply (for good reasons), but companies like Microsoft and Apple do. The CCP doesn't specifically target any American companies.\n\n&gt;We should reciprocate.\n\nShould we copy their Great Firewall as well and ban any apps that doesn't allow government backdoor for data access? Winnie the Pooh can unilaterally ban any site/app he doesn't like, and that's what makes their government terrible, do we really want our President to have *exactly* the same type of power?\n\nIf there are privacy/national security concerns, then legislate through Congress and punish all apps/software that doesn't abide by the law, be it Facebook or WeChat. \n\nHowever I feel extremely uncomfortable that \"national security concern\" is now just the magic keyword that gives the President unlimited power to do whatever he wants. What's next, banning CNN and MSNBC because the FBI \"uncovered\" some connection between the networks and some foreign government?\n\nFurthermore speaking from personal experience, WeChat is used by millions of Chinese Americans as a chat app, very often with friends/relatives back in China. It's very similar to Line and WhatsApp in that regard. Using this logic Trump can ban all phone calls or emails or texts to China because there is a risk of the CCP government monitoring on their side.",

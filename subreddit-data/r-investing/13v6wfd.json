    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI have a quick question about taxes when selling stock at a profit.\n\nYes, I am aware of long term and short term tax rates - long term is 1 year hold at a minimum, and short term is less than a year taxed at whatever bracket you find yourself in.\n\nBut what if there is a mix of long and short term?\n\nSuppose I buy 100 shares of stock A at 10 dollars a share. The value since then tanks 80%, to 2 dollars per share.\n\nI decide to hang on to this. A year passes by and I see this stock at 2 dollars and decide to buy 100 more shares.\n\nI am now invested 1200 dollars into this, with 6 dollar average cost.\n\nSix months after I buy additional 100 shares, the stock miraculously goes up to 12 bucks per share and I decide to sell.\n\nHow am I being taxed now:\n\n1. 100 shares are considered long term and 100 shares are considered short term\n2. All of it is now being considered short term.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Each trade / lot is considered individually.  So #1.  To expand a bit - if you were to sell 100 shares instead of 200 your brokerage account will ask you what cost basis to use and the choices are FIFO, LIFO, and selected lots.  FIFO is first in first out so that would sell the first 100 shares.  LIFO is last in first out so it would sell the second 100 shares.  And custom / select lots allows you to pick which to sell.",

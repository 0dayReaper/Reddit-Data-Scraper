    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am looking for an API to use to collect dividend data. I have used IEX cloud for many year but they have recently gone 100% paid, and the pricing doesn't quite make sense for what I do.\n\nCan you recommend an API to collect basic dividend data - ie amount last paid, next ex/paid date, next amount, the last 12 months worth of history? I am simply trying to automate my portfolio tracking (currently in Google Sheets). I can probably scrape yahoo finance instead, but would rather use an API as long as the data is good and not too laggy.\n\nThanks in advance for any recommendations!",

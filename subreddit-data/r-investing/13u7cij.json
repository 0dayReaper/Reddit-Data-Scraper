    "postText": "Hey all! Just started investing recently. I\u2019ve rolled over my old work 401k and put it all into an S&amp;P500 index fund (in a Roth IRA) and am now trying to understand why international index funds will benefit my portfolio despite their low life-of-fund returns. I understand the diversity is important because history doesn\u2019t mean similar results in the future, so if international stocks do great I\u2019ll be able to benefit from that in the future.\n\nWhat are some examples of when international stocks did better than US domestic stocks. Did their greater success justify holding on to them despite their overall lower lifetime yields when compared to S&amp;P500 or Total Stock Market Index funds? \n\nAlso, I am 23 years old. Would my longer time horizon mean I should be okay to just invest in the S&amp;P500 index funds since I have more time to ride out bear markets?\n\nThanks!",

EDIT -- fixed the link for this one: https://web.archive.org/web/20221226033655/https://tweedy.com/resources/library_docs/papers/Dichotomy%20Btwn%20US%20and%20Non-US%20Sept2022%20Fund.pdf\n\n&gt;put it all into an S&amp;P500 index fund \n\nI did a backtest analysis on Portfolio Visualizer, showing a 50/25/25 split of S&amp;P 500/international/bonds beat the overall S&amp;P 500 from 1999-2016. https://imgur.com/a/4jz89kW\n\nhave you looked up long-term performance of the S&amp;P 500 vs. the S&amp;P 400 (mid cap) and S&amp;P 600 (small cap)? Over some long periods, like 1995-2015, small and mid cap US stocks had much better returns. https://contrarianoutlook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Large-Mid-Small-Chart.png",

The US corporate economy overwhelmingly crushed the rest of the world from 1950 to 1989, but did not necessarily beat the western Europe/Canada/Japan stock markets that existed at the time.  \n\nThe lesson should be some non-US investment can make sense, but if you try to extrapolate that to \"all\" _current_ non-US is better because of the limited results of that timeframe, that is a bad idea.  Today there are far more and different markets.",

What the data shows is that no country has the best performing stocks at all times. US stocks do not provide the best returns over all time periods as many investors incorrectly believe. The fact that US stocks have done the best on average over the last century is largely irrelevant, because we don't get to invest for 100 years, and even if we did, there's no guarantee the next 100 years will be like the past 100 years. We only have a few decades to maximize our exposure to stocks so it makes no sense to YOLO on a single country, especially when other countries can offer similar/better returns.",

And that was primarily due to the Japanese stock market bubble. \n\nIf we use \"normal\" metrics - the kind you would use in evaluating the performance of a stock or ETF - we see that the US has outperformed ex-US over the last 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 years. \n\nI understand why people feel safer putting some of their portfolio in ex-US for diversity; I really do, and if they feel better doing that, they should definitely do so. \n\nWhat I object to is the idea that ex-US is somehow \"due\" to outperform, or that there is some law of nature that requires US and ex-US to go through cycles of performance and outperformance. There isn't. \n\nSo by all means people should invest internationally if they want. \n\nThey should just stop trying to prove that ex-US will soon outperform.",

It depends on why US stocks outperform.\n\nIf they outperform because earnings growth is stronger among US-listed firms, then you wouldn't expect the gap to close.\n\nIf, on the other hand (as appears to be the case), past US returns are the result of a drift upward in valuation relative to other markets in advanced economies, then you'd expect mean reversion and lower US returns relative to international over time.\n\nIt's complicated because the US market has better growth prospects than Europe, UK, or Japan, but worse than Canada, Australia, and emerging economies. Its valuations are extremely high. There are also foreign firms listing in the US to get that sweet dollar.",

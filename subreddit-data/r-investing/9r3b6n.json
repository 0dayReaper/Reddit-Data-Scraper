They can just churn them out at item cost now.\n\nI didn't buy in. I remember back in March or so when everyone was dogging them for not making their numbers but they were *moving in the right direction* and I posted about how that was the important bit: moving too slowly in the right direction is 1000x better than moving in the wrong direction, but everyone was hung up on whether it was 2000 or 3000 cars and whether it was February or March. In the big picture that doesn't matter as long as they keep moving forward, which they did. And this is the long term result.\n\nHonestly something I learned working at a very successful company: most people declare failure *way* too early for everything. They're afraid of working through the ugly, embarrassing part, so they don't. It's the people that fight through that, keep their eye on the ball, and ignore everyone else that succeed.\n\nWish I had bought in when I was thinking about all this.",

Perhaps if we were able or willing to go without any hint of a paycheck for 12-24 months we would have started from scratch.

One of the things he's talked about is how its really hard for the owners of small companies to pull out of things when they're not going well. There's a sunk cost fallacy going on, but the meat of it is that people will keep throwing their money into a failing business because they're too emotionally invested to stop before they've wrecked all their finances.\n\nI would suggest selling the company before ever touching your 401k. People will get caught up with the times the odds are defied, and for every success for those who went all in, there are a lot of people with failed marriages and wrecked finances because they destroyed themselves trying to keep a business.

They're afraid of working through the ugly, embarrassing part, so they don't. It's the people that fight through that, keep their eye on the ball, and ignore everyone else that succeed.\n\nAs a software developer, I never understood this mentality. Your company hasn't folded until it's folded. Just because you missed a few deadlines does not spell the end of the company. As long as you're making progress, you're still doing pretty well.\n\n\nI never understood the obsession with seeing Tesla fail, and so many people all over the place claiming it as fact. Like, no, if it really were a problem, then Tesla wouldn't be expanding. They've had their bumps, but by and large they've always been on the right track, at least since the first Model Ss rolled off the line. \n\n\nYeah, I've been following Tesla since the first Roadster appeared, and it's hilarious how many people don't realize that Tesla has always gotten far more negative coverage than they deserve.

Just because you missed a few deadlines does not spell the end of the company.

Afterwards he just decided to cancel class a few times because he felt too busy to teach. I started referring to the dude as \"two-weeks\" because any time I tried to talk to him about something he'd avoid me and say \"ask me again in two weeks.\"",

Many of the Tesla bears think the big auto manufacturers can modify a factory and start cranking out millions of EVs in 1-2 years. What they don't understand is these cars require a totally different work force and knowledgebase to create. Tesla has no experience making ICEs whereas the other manufacturers have been doing that for a century. They are likely to innovate much slower and be scared to make cars that are radically different than what they have now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the time Tesla is cranking out the Model Y, Semi, Roadster 2.0, the big manufacturers will probably be cranking out something equivalent to the 2014 Model S with a huge grill on the front so it looks like an ICE. Not to mention they are years behind on charging infrastructure. They likely won't be as aggressive as Tesla on expanding coverage globally until ICE sales begin declining heavily. ",

I still think of Tesla as a battery and software company as much as they are a car company.  The cars will bring down the price of batteries.

I see them getting into buildings too.  \n\nThe media and others keep trying to force musk to just stay on cars, but they are so wrong.  I think this was huge reason why musk wants to go private.  at this point, you can get a car, battery storage, and a roof from tesla.  The boring company will be making the bricks, so it only makes sense that tesla will eventually sell you your smart house too.  I am not sure if they will use subcontractors.  not sure if they will acquire a company or maybe partner with a company, but the home should definitely have Tesla's name on it.  \n\nSustainable building is so slow right now.  it desperately needs to be simplified.  Homes need to be smaller, but loaded with technologies and a lot of glass to make them feel bigger.  most people want to buy big homes to impress people but the future has to be more focused on quality and not quantity.  Telsa does not have to take huge market share.  Tesla is the only company that can really make this change.",

I imagine that's a big part of it, additionally ASP is higher with the AWD/Perf push adding around 10% GM of it's own.

These are legitimate improvements in actual production processes when it comes to building the Model 3.",

That has been the biggest problem and the one most analysts were focused on and Tesla flat out managed to do it this quarter.\n\nI'd also point out that as much as the permabull camp loves to scream 'FUD' here none of this was just fated to happen and in the lead up to it Elon Musk specifically managed to make some massive fuck ups like committing securities fraud and then almost rejecting a super generous settlement and putting his ability to control the company at risk.  The company spent the prior 3 quarters burning through billions of dollars of cash with very little to show for it and Elon specifically lashing out at any journalist, analyst or short seller who pointed that out.  These weren't imaginary fears or some conspiracy is was the company having trouble actually building cars profitably.\n\nYeah a bunch of TSLAQ bullshit about the company going bankrupt next quarter or there being some Enron level fraud going on when Tesla's production and financial issues were pretty public.  Which again was made even worse by Elon Musk going onto Twitter and fabricating a buyout plan.\n\nI find it amazing that people still act like it was completely unreasonable to think Elon Musk was unstable and unreliable after that bullshit and questioned the company's ability to deliver on its fairly lofty promises.  This wasn't some surefire thing and people had plenty of reasons to be worried about it happening at before Tesla had to roll over a substantial amount of debt.\n\nQ3 delivered ultimately and you're going to see a host of analyst upgrades and revisions because of it.

I expected them to turn a profit and generate FCF, but I will admit, Tesla surpassed my expectations by a wide margin and they will be able to pay off the November convertibles. Now, the big question, is this sustainable?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA key question, which obviously Tesla won't reveal or doesn't know, is how many of the original $420k Model 3 reservations were for the $35k variant that is at least 6-12 months away from production, and perhaps will never be produced.\n\n* On the call they noted that less than 20% of reservations have been canceled. I don't think Musk would give critics an inch, so I am going to assume that this number is just about 20% (If it was 17% they would have said 17%). \n* Tesla has delivered around 95k Model 3's \\~22% of backlog\n\nA critical question is how much of the backlog is for the $35k Model 3 variant. Let's try to narrow this down logically\n\n* To start off, you would say *at least* 50% of the original 420k was for the $35k version. The ASP of a car in America is just about \\~$36k \n* Now, I think it's also fair to say that Tesla's target market has a higher ASP for their car purchases than the average American, so I'll keep that $35k reservation composition at 50% or 210k of the original 420k\n* How many of the cancellations are the Model 3 variant? Very safe to say most of them, I would argue virtually all of them. Why? The person waiting on a $35k car doesn't have the same luxury of tying up $1k in reservation nor wait indefinitely for their car to even be produced (it's been almost 2 years since reservations were opened up). Somebody putting down $1k deposit and buying a $60k car has at least another one to drive around in the meantime. \n\nSo to summarize the numbers, I am assuming 210k of OG reservations were for ASP &gt;$35k. Of those, 95k delivered, which would leave 115k remaining on the ASP &gt;$35k backlog. Assuming 210k of OG backlog was for $35k Model 3, there have been 84k cancellations, leaving 126k of $35k backlog.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBulls may be asking, \"but what if more reservations have been added, either somewhat supplanting deliveries, or fully replacing deliveries?\" Well we know that's not what has happened, because Tesla opened up ordering to people without reservations in July.  Additionally, new customers were getting delivery windows of 1-2 months, considerably less time than reservation holders were for deliveries. I would guess this is because these people were ordering higher ASP versions, which is understandable that Tesla would prioritized them in survival mode, but also tells you something about demand for the higher ASP Model 3's\n\nSo, the backlog is what it is at this point. But this raises another question, if they still had 115k of reservations for ASP higher than $35k as of October, why would they ditch reservations in July? Doesn't make a lot of sense to me. This would lead me to believe that the % of backlog for $35k Model 3 is higher than the 50% assumed. Let's look at some scenarios:\n\n|% of Original Backlog for $35k Model 3|Remaining Backlog for ASP &gt;$35k|\n|:-|:-|\n|50%|115,000|\n|55%|94,000|\n|60%|73,000|\n|65%|52,000|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla delivered 55k Model 3's in Q3-18. Between 60-65% of OG backlog being for $35k version is where they begin to run into trouble with the growth story. This also coincides with higher ASP backlog being worked down first. So possibly modest to flat growth in deliveries at a lower ASP? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat doesn't bode well for Q4-18 deliveries does it? We should be getting the October delivery numbers in a week. Is anyone still confused as to why the Q3-18 earnings call was hastily announced and ahead of typical Tesla timeline?",

I've personally worked in a company where the CEO is a \"stable genius\", when the line workers start feeling like their CEO is making stupid decisions it's poison for morale and productivity.",

They're -1.5 Billion on the year so far. Even if they have +254 million this quarter and more next-quarter, that's solidly unprofitable this year.\n\nAccounts-payable will grow because Tesla is naturally making more cars. So you have to keep all elements in the balance sheet in mind. You can't just assume Tesla \"owns\" all of that 800-ish Million it just made, its gotta pay its suppliers and other such stuff.\n\nGAAP of $254 Million is the figure to focus on.",

If TSLA can stretch their payables to 90 days while AR is collected in let's say 30 days, that's fantastic. While your point is understood that increases in AP are a source of cash that eventually get paid out and represent an outflow, 1) I don't think GAAP requires cash on the BS to be netted against changes in AP....that doesn't make sense to me; and 2) it doesn't mean they can't continue to manage working capital in a way that generates favorable cash flow on a quarterly basis. Yes, the AP will eventually get paid, but AR is growing faster and could be collected on better terms than their AP; 3) if we are stripping out increases in AP as a source of cash, why are we ignoring the ~$500MM increase in AR that is a use of cash and already stripped out of FCF? You'd need to add that value back and then we're essentially back at the $740MM of cash to the balance sheet discussed earlier, so while I follow what you are saying I don't quite follow the significance / logic of what you are trying to argue.\n\nBut either way, we can be punitive and strip out the $535MM or so increase in AP and like you said they are still FCF positive +$254MM. That still bodes wells, but yes, agreed that they are still negative on the year. The caveat to that is that the whole thesis on TSLA rests on a certain amount of volume being achieved to where the 3 becomes FCF positive. If Q3 is that pivot point, then the past quarters of negative FCF aren't all that important to the future profile of the company.\n\n",

Dumping inventory to improve Accounts-Receivable only happens once.\n\nWith that being said, it seems like Tesla **is** reporting a GAAP profit of $254 million. Which should be taking into account all of this. So yes, its a pivot point and you are right to be bullish.\n\nBut I'd argue the number to focus on is $254 million as their Q3 profit number.

We were talking about cash flow and cash on hand earlier, not net income. Net income is kind of irrelevant to some extent as it isn't cash flow and growth in net income would impact retained earnings by that amount, not cash on hand which we were discussing earlier. \n\nAs for AP, my broader point was they can have their payment days negotiated to be longer than their AR, which will continue to benefit them, not be a one time thing. But if we want to strip out the growth in AP to account / hair cut their cash balance to reflect the future cash outlays Tesla will have to make to satisfy theses payables, we would also need to adjust for the fact AR grew q/q and acted as a use of cash in the existing calculation of working cap. As I am sure you know, AR represents future cash inflows to the company and it grew by generally the same gross amount as AP, so this all strikes me as a relatively non-issue.\n\nAny way -- maybe it isn't important.

Netflix also reported very early in the earnings cycle and the whole market got dragged the next few days on poor guidance from Caterpillar and 3M. Tesla's earnings are solid and there hasn't been an announcement of additional leveraging yet....in fact, this report paints a path for them to deleverage if these FCF trends continue. Furthermore, with each day we get further into the earnings cycle and I suspect TSLA reporting good earning should help support the broader market and calm the nerves about high flying tech stocks and valuations, so long as their commentary / guidance on the call tonight aren't overly bearish due to tariffs and rising costs. That said, there is a laundry list of corporates reporting this week and any one of them could set off further selling which could negatively impact TSLA even in spite of strong earnings. ",

I think they finally managed to work out their production issues earlier than expected and that's pretty much the most positive thing that could have happened for the company. There's some things being held back for sure, SG&amp;A containment probably won't last and capex undershot projections. Product mix will probably worsen with the MR but it makes sense to do it now that they're actually making some substantial gross margins on the Model 3. This should keep parts inventory from building and give them a better ability to negotiate on prices and potentially lengthen their cash conversion cycle out. This definitely leaves them with enough cash on hand to delever a bit too if they want.\n\nPretty much great all around, a little massaging but none of it really changes the core performance here. Haven't been short this thing since around the $260 mark and at this point I don't think I will be going forward. They've legitimately seem to have worked out their major production kinks and likely have plenty of runway for an EU launch at this point. If they can execute similarly in Q4 or a maybe a bit worse they're going to be in a very good position going forward here until there's legitimate competition from other luxury brands.\n",

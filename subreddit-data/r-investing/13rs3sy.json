    "postText": "I'm not talking about explicit insider information, but rather more general info. For example, I work in a corporation, but not at the insider information level. However, I see the general direction the company is going, and it makes me feel a certain way about the future of the company, based on decisions that are made. What's interesting is, despite no major news announcements, the stock is continuing to move in the same direction of my sentiments. \n\nIt makes me think that if a large investor or hedge fund was able to build relationships with lower-level employees at corporations, they could get a feel for what is going on inside the company, and make decisions accordingly. Basically any employee at any corporation has more visibility to the internal workings than an outsider, and a large investor could piece together rumors and sentiments from inside the company to create a profile of where the company is heading.\n\nIs anyone aware of this type of thing happening?",

If you look a couple days before, let\u2019s say earnings, the stock will start to lean one way or the other due to rumors/news leaking out.  This phenomenon is researched at universities to determine how efficient markets are. \n\nNow, are hedge funds going and making friends with mid level employees at a company, I don\u2019t think so.  But as stated previously, institutions have more access to corporate leadership than most investors do; for example, you never hear Joe Schmo asking a question on an earnings call, just analysts from JP Morgan types.",

You should read the book Black Edge by Sheelah Kolhatkar about Steve Cohen and the \"edge\" they had from mid to high level employees at all types of companies and how they obscured whether or not they were insider trading.",

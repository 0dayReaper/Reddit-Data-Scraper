    "postText": "China has inflation rate of practically 0% and interest loan rates of 3.65%. And they are not recovering that fast from COVID as expected, at least for now.\r  \n\r  \nDoesn't this mean that at any moment the China may start to stimulate their economy/businesses with lowering their interest rate and raise its inflation a bit, so their companies stocks might start rising also?\r  \n\r  \nPlease share your opinions. What would be the best investment in this case? maybe KWEB, MCHI, CQQQ, FXI, or something similar. Do you think this is good idea?",

Yes I've seen the China hustle and well aware of the risks.\n\nThe amount of skepticism and even downright hatred towards China is downright massive and I have underestimated the negative sentiment.\n\nReality is that nobody believes the numbers from China and there are so many risks involved that are unique to investing in China.\n\nI think on paper something like KWEB being discounted by 75% from ATH could actually be enough to overcome the risks if you are a gambler like me. \n\nIf you know anything about China you will know that the KWEB holdings are companies that have some very legitimate and visible economic activity within China. Tencent, Alibaba, etc are real businesses. So if you want to gamble on China that would be the play, to me.",

China equities potential for the incoming decade is too big to ignore. I have increased my China equities position ratio to 17% in May. Usually I keep them under 10% but have been increasing my China stocks steadily. I would stop at 25%.",

Germany and France are trying to work with China despite US wanting them to decouple with China. China have a growing middle income class which is extremely good for its economy. Chinese equities will do well and its multi year mega bull run have just begun on 01 June 2023. Buy low sell high. MCHI, KWEB are at the low now. Smart investors have bought in Chinese equities for the past few weeks. The reason why US want to decouple China is to slow their growth. It could also mean if US start to be more open minded and resume free trade with China, China stocks would be up 50-70% in an instant. This could happen any time.",

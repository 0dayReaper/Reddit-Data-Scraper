Which makes sense, retail is a lot less leveraged.  \n\nWhat is happening is that lots of big banks were generally freaked out because with sharp rate increases they are being hit very hard on highly leveraged bond portfolios.  Also their fee based work is collapsing, things like mortgage inceptions dropped dramatically, the kinds of drops in activity that were it happening economy wide would be a depression.  Underwriting for bonds dropped off.  Companies going IPO almost disappeared.  It feels like a recession to them. \n\nLower paid employees are experiencing the best job market in decades.  Lower paid employees aren't getting interviewed by the WSJ. They also are upset about inflation more than they should be so even when they are interviewed their off the cuff opinion is negative. \n\nThere are no conspiracies of disinformation ever. There is no big money acting in concert to deceive retail ever. Rather there are lots of people in the markets with 18 mo earnings focuses that are investing with supposedly longer time frames.",

I also sell puts on SPY against the cash position to get another 10% or so of premium or until I get the shares on a reasonable discount.\n\nAfter all, my best protection against a potential downturn is my W2 job and my emergency fund (which is the cash mentioned above).",

This about to have a recession economy the media has been pushing for the last two years has added 14 million jobs, has an all time high GDP, all time high wages, and a stock market gain of about 15%. Those facts haven't really been shared by the media a whole lot - I'm guessing if a different party was in charge they would have been emphasized and bragged about.",

            "comment": "media wants to keep instilling fear so institutions can hog up all the shares. Once done, media will reverse its message and become bullish which sucks in retail while those institutions unload their shares. The retail provide support when institutions sell. Retail then gets frustrated bc as soon as they bought, they are down 1+ percent. They can then sell for a loss which provides liquidity to  institutions so the cycle repeats. I\u2019ve found success ignoring what the media says and follow price along with a 30week moving average. If the MA trends up, I\u2019m long. Flattens, I pay attention. Falls, I\u2019m out. I sold all of my s&amp;p mutual fund in Feb 2022. Sat cash and bought 100% back  in Jan 2023 despite whatever the media was saying at the time. Avoided the majority of the drawdown in 2022 and am riding the current  recovery.",

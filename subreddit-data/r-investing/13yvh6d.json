Valuation methods have changed, just buying low PE isn't good enough anymore. \n\nThat's why I believe the most important part of the book is psychology. Investors push stocks way above and below what they are worth. Learning to invest based off facts instead of emotion keeps investors from buying into promotional companies and bubbles.",

Then next was going to be Securities Analysis and Machiavelli and The Prince and Other Writings.

Buffett has continued to profit despite his size due to irrationality and compounding, While RenTec has a cap on its size due to the very thing that makes it profitable. RenTec can never get to size of BRK, and still be have the same returns. This is just a matter of physics. Whereas BRK can continue to scale.\nI dont think people generally fathom the feat of what BRK has accomplished.",

Do you not understand what that means for an investor? Essentially it will throw cash but they will always have the problem of figuring out what then to do with that cash as it can be reinvested at the same rate?\n\nIts like saying \u201chey i have 1000% in returns in nano caps\u2026\u201d to someone with billions. While that is great, theres really nothing i can do with that, as due to just size alone the risk and return wouldnt make sense.",

Although it is a classic - as often with those, there is a certain level of hype and people feel they have to love it - most of the principles and recommendations are out of date. \n\nWhy? Because the very nature of the economy has changed: \n- Services have a different cost structure and cash requirements\n- Internet has disrupted the way information is shared and greatly reduced price discovery (electronic trading was not there too)\n- QE among other things has resulted in multiple expansion across the board (eg. If you only bought businesses trading at &lt; 1x P/BV (price to book value) over the last decade, you would have only been able to purchase banks).\n\nGraham himself broke his own rules on a number of occasions including when he acquired 50% of GEICO in 1948, representing 20% of his own fund at that time. By 1972, this sole investment had generated a 500x+ return dwarfing the performance of all his other investments combined.\n\nBottom line, take his book as a series of recommendations on value investing (eg. Analyse companies, BS &amp; CF, don\u2019t rush, prefer asset backed companies rather than those based on hyper, diversify your portfolio etc).\n\nAt the end of his life, when asked if his framework was still relevant he explained that it had been updated many times because the world had changed too. Read a detailed summary and focus your time and attention on other books.",

Intelligent Investor has a target audience of  1940s upper class investors.  Most of the people reading it are middle class.  So for example the book assumes you have a personal banker, the people being recommended this book do not. The book is dated as far as technique, many things simply could not be done, for example the S&amp;P guide he recommends for initial screening hasn't been published since the 1990s.  Intelligent Investor is a lousy first investing book. The people recommending it I suspect haven't read it themselves. \n\nLet's start with a simple question.  Are you just trying to get a portfolio going (in which case I'd suggest a robo).  Or are you trying to learn.  In which case I'd start with more modern books on asset allocation.  You can (and probably should) outsource your stock picking to mutual fund companies via etfs. If you want to learn to stock pick... then I'll mention that Intelligent Investor is more fun than most of the other books you'll need to read which are about financial statement analysis. \n\nSo let's start with where are you in your journey?",

The best one I've ever read on futures was https://www.amazon.com/Treasury-Bond-Basis-Depth-Arbitrageurs/dp/0071456104 .

A stock is just a long call, a short put at the same strike and cash.  So turning cash into a covered call with a put cancels out any mispricing. If you do think stocks are mispriced you can make directional options trades but you don't have to.",

            "comment": "Ask ChatGPT to give you a summary of the book. You can even define how detailed the summary should be\u2026 for example, here is the five paragraph version:\n\n\"The Intelligent Investor\" by Benjamin Graham is a timeless investment classic that provides valuable insights on how to approach the stock market and make sound investment decisions. In summary, the book can be summarized in five paragraphs as follows:\n\n1. Graham emphasizes the importance of adopting a defensive approach to investing. He suggests that investors should view themselves as business owners rather than speculators. By focusing on analyzing the intrinsic value of a company and purchasing stocks at a discount, investors can reduce their risk and increase their chances of achieving long-term success.\n\n2. The book introduces the concept of Mr. Market, an imaginary character who represents the emotional and often irrational behavior of the stock market. Graham advises investors to take advantage of Mr. Market's mood swings by buying stocks when they are undervalued and selling when they become overvalued. This approach is known as value investing and aims to capitalize on market inefficiencies.\n\n3. Graham emphasizes the importance of thorough research and analysis when selecting stocks. He introduces the concept of a margin of safety, which involves buying stocks at a price significantly below their intrinsic value to provide a cushion against potential losses. By focusing on companies with strong financials, a history of stable earnings, and a competitive advantage, investors can increase their chances of finding undervalued opportunities.\n\n4. The book cautions against speculation and market timing, highlighting the unpredictability of short-term price movements. Instead, Graham encourages a long-term investment mindset, advocating for a disciplined approach of regularly investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks. This strategy reduces the impact of market fluctuations and provides better odds of achieving consistent returns over time.\n\n5. Finally, Graham emphasizes the importance of managing one's emotions and avoiding herd mentality. He encourages investors to remain disciplined, patient, and rational, even in times of market euphoria or panic. By sticking to a well-defined investment plan and avoiding impulsive decisions, investors can navigate market volatility more effectively and achieve their long-term financial goals.\n\nIn essence, \"The Intelligent Investor\" provides a comprehensive guide to value investing, focusing on fundamental analysis, a margin of safety, and a long-term perspective. It equips readers with the tools and mindset necessary to navigate the stock market with prudence and discipline, aiming for sustainable investment success.",

Certainly if you're just slogging through it because someone told you it's a good book you probably wont get much out of it anyway. I find it very hard to absorb information when not engaged. \n\nBut a lot of investing IS boring, at least it will be boring if you find that book boring, its reading statements and transcripts and doing research and math. So if you are just finding this book boring but others interesting it's fine to put it down and maybe circle back to it later, but if you find a lot of investing books and work boring then maybe consider why you're doing it at all.",

Furthermore, everything you listed I have had to do it previously and I enjoy it very much, but it's this book I am having a hard time with.

For me starting at Chapter 14, that\u2019s when the book started to get more interesting. \n\nAll the original text is dated. Many of the companies listed as examples no longer exist or changed names. Even some portions are no longer valid because laws have changed. Reading the commentary sections (assuming you have the revised version by Jason Zweig) made it easier for me to comprehend what the *bleep I was reading. But even Jason Zweig is referencing stuff from the dot-com bubble when I was a kid. Wish a more modern version would be written relevant to our time of tech and growth stocks. \n\nI can\u2019t claim to understand all the details and remember all the numbers. To me, the point of this book to me is get you to grasp the big picture of investing, how much commitment you have to put into it with some detail on valuations and ratios. But this is probably not the book that\u2019s going to make you a pro at slicing and dicing 10k\u2019s and coming up with ratios. (If anyone has a book they recommend, I\u2019d love to learn more).\n\nThe two of the most memorable pieces of text for me are the footnote on page 375 of Chapter 14 commentary and the last part of the chapter 18 commentary on page 486. \n\nIf you can tough it out, you\u2019ll get the accomplishment of finishing it and will come away with a bit more of knowledge.

            "comment": "Alternate take: That book is a really good way to understand a traditional style called value investing. Philip Fisher *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits* was more the beginning of Growth investing.  And *One up on Wall Street* is more about finding good companies all around you (a qualitative way of doing Quality assessments).  Buffet uses special deals and moats and try's to find a different type of value, and sometimes cash.\n\nThis is what makes my take an alternate take: Its harder to find large or mid cap companies than it was in the past that meet those metrics because they are already sifted through by everyone else including algorhythms, and the far more complicated than they first appear factor ETF's.  If you really want to best apply those strategies, small caps are best because the bigger funds, ETF, institutions etc do not scoop them up as much (there is less to scoop up) and because data is harder to find.  Small companies are where something like One up on Wall Street or even traditional value (Graham) or growth investing (Fisher) can shine.  \n\nFor larger stocks it can be better to take a indexing strategy or alternatively read and understand the factors and how the special indexes that use them were derived. It is very very interesting and very data based.  An easy way to find it is either CFA institute books, or alternatively look at whitepapers which describe the theory behind each of the now multitude of factors. Note dont confuse them with thematic investing, that is a very different idea.  Also realize factors have an inherently cyclical nature, and contrary to popular opinion can be combined with older styles like value (now often called \"Fundamental\") or Growth.\n\nOfcourse just my opinion.\n\nNote also: if you do want to understand options start with *Options, Futures and Other Derivatives* by Hull then read of the numerous different strategies from a reputable source: [https://www.cboe.com/optionsinstitute/](https://www.cboe.com/optionsinstitute/)\n\nNote two: When you are unsure, start broad then very gradual go narrow.  While Mr Munger is likely right \"I would rather invest in just my best ideas\" it takes a long time to learn to think like Mr Munger.",

They can be used to supplement investing (cash secured puts at your stocks price target to buy, and covered calls to sell), or they can be used outright in the form of strangles, spreads, etc.  I would go the read a book route but there are also courses:\n\n[https://ecornell.cornell.edu/certificates/financial-management/investment-strategies/](https://ecornell.cornell.edu/certificates/financial-management/investment-strategies/)",

While I\u2019ll agree that index fund investing is relatively safe over the long term, for most people they will never make the kind of returns people like Warren Buffett made when he first started out (probably quite difficult for most people to do anyway). Concentration builds wealth as Buffet says, and I\u2019m an adherent of that mantra. Analysis, understanding market dynamics, studying the business model etc, these aspects have all been important in my decision making regarding which stock to buy. I\u2019ve also made concentrated bets and maintained discipline and patience throughout. Since 2014 having invested in only two companies I\u2019ve beaten the market by a substantial margin and turned $160k into $2 million. Index funds for Mum and dads won\u2019t make that kind of money in 9 years unless you earn a high income and plow everything into index funds with reinvestment plans. Granted it depends on your risk tolerance, but following the principles as outlined in the Intelligent Investor coupled with patience, discipline and concentrated bets will pay off much more handsomely than broad diversification (for me diversification comes later when you have built up substantial wealth and you want to maintain/protect it).",

I think of these things as you gotta know where you are coming from, to know where you are going. At least for me, this has helped me to understand investing climate.\n\nBuffett and Munger style has changed over time due to this understanding. Majority of investors don\u2019t get this.\n\nA simple mental game, work through if you were a successful nano cap investor. With time, youd HAVE to move up the food chain. And at every level youd have to adapt your style, because what works at one level no longer works at the new one.\n\nContrary to common view, there are markets where Ben Graham style actually does work. Not every market is as efficient as America. \n\nAs an investor, its gonna put more tools in your box. I think truly good investor wouldnt be trying to copy BRK, nor would Charlie or Warren be investing in the same way if they were 100x smaller.\n\nMy opinion is I dont think generally people truly grasp the magnitude and difficulty of what BRK has accomplished and even at its size they can pull new tricks out their hat and continue to evolve.\n\nAsk yourself how serious are you about investing .",

Part of the job of an investor is finding inefficiencies in markets, so you can profit off of this as much as possible. This book is one of the top sellers ever. Many people have read it. If many people hold that view, that should tell you that many people wont even bother looking in that market. \nGiven that Buffett once owned a share of a 30 share duck hunting club \ud83d\ude02which was amazingly profitable, I can tell you he\u2019d be starting with the A\u2019s as he always says, if his cash was appropriate size. Even looking at Nick Sleep, Nomad Partnership was profiting handsomely in 3rd world markets most people would consider uninvestable.\n\nThe book is there as pieces of information to take into account, not to be mindless followed. \nYou\u2019ll notice the great investors generally all have their own styles, and incorporate little pieces of different learning as they go along. The point i was making is a successful investor will grow and change as time goes on, and grasping \u2018why do you\u2019 aids in that more that knowing the \u2018what do you\u2019.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m going to go against 99% of what most people are going to tell you and say that it is not essential. The book is dense, not for beginners, and will need multiple read throughs to truly understand the concepts and ideas being presented. That\u2019s definitely why you\u2019re finding it boring and I don\u2019t blame you. You\u2019re better off spending some time looking at free online resources that teach you the essence of value investing and the framework you should use than to try and force your way through a book you clearly aren\u2019t enjoying. That being said, the book does provide a very useful framework on how to think about investing if you can grasp the concepts. But back to the point about is it essential\u2026not really.",

I think I might swap those two out when I find an easier to understand and beginner friendly alternative. Thank you.",

Today I'd reccommend that the very first book anyone read about investing is The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel.  It will inform and influence everything that you decide to pursue afterwards and the manner in which you frame those pursuits.",

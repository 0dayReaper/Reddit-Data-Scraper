    "postText": "Obviously in hindsight it's not a great idea - I opened some $SPY June-24 puts and $SH (1x inverse ETF) earlier this year thinking it's a good idea to hedge the downside risk since everyone and their grandma are talking about an incoming recession. I wanted to have some ammo to \"buy-the-dip\" whenever that comes. Apparently, I was caught off-guard by this recent AI boom and those shorts are underwater. These are about 5-7% of my total investment portfolio.\n\nNow I'm quite struggling what to do -\n\n* Close them out? The S&amp;P500 looks extremely over-extended to me, especially when it was screwed by those very few tech giants. I have a fear the market gonna tank once I hit Sell.\n* Even if I do, should I sit in cash or flip to long immediately?\n* Hold them and wait for a pull-back? But when? The index just keeps going higher week after week.\n\nWhat would you do if you're in my shoes? My long-term plan is to hold mostly ETFs like VOO, VTI, SCHD/G/Y, etc. I only started to DCA into SCHD recently given its relative underperformance YTD.\n\nAny thought or comment is highly appreciated!",

Add to the long positions with any excess income. Don't fret the noise. Check in maybe once a year to make sure your current portfolio aligns with your long term goals.\n\nWill SPY go to 400? 360? 300?! Do you care?

Ordinarily I would just DCA into the market but this time I speculated that SPY is overpriced and that it priced in a no landing scenario + a lot of growth in a high IR background. I think that illusion will fade in Q3 and market will correct. So I would hold but I have a feeling that you might have overpaid for that very long PUT. I think the probability of under 3700 SPY is very very low in a year. So I\u2019d be looking for an exit target later in the year when some scare makes the VIX jump.\n\nETA not financial advice.

    "postText": "New Jersey fined Uber $649 Million for Saying Drivers Aren\u2019t Employees. New Jersey has demanded that Uber pay $649 million for years of unpaid employment taxes for its drivers, arguing that the ride-hailing company has misclassified the workers as independent contractors and not as employees.\n\nA audit uncovered $530 million in back taxes that had not been paid for unemployment and disability insurance from 2014 to 2018. Because of the nonpayment, the state is seeking another $119 million in interest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/nyregion/uber-new-jersey-drivers.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/nyregion/uber-new-jersey-drivers.html)",

Contractors work however they want and employees need to be on call for certain periods and be at certain hot spots. Just a thought.

If they remove all penalties for drivers (other than retaining the right to ban people from their platform for egregious behavior), then they can probably get away with classifying drivers as contractors based on federal law.  That won't help them with the state laws though, as the states are explicitly clarifying the vague statements in the federal law in order to classify Uber drivers as employees.",

You want to allow companies to hire consultants to do one-off jobs without a ton of overhead and risk.  However, there is also a public interest in employees having unemployment/disability/etc taxes paid so that when they're out of work or injured they don't become dependent on the general public to support them.  \n\nThe CA law sets a pretty good definition.  To my eyes it seems to cover most working arrangements that would fall under consulting and so on, but not when all the work at your company is being done by \"consultants\" all doing the same task.  If you hire somebody to fix your plumbing you'd be fine under the CA law.  If you hire an army of plumbers to subcontract your rent-a-plumber service's work to then you would need to treat them as employees.",

They might drive for multiple companies, but the drivers are basically doing nothing else for long periods of time.\n\nIf they had to exclusively give the work to people who are just doing this for an hour or two per week they'd need to find a LOT more drivers.  There might not be that many people willing to work under those terms.  After all, they'd need to find other full-time work and wouldn't be available to just sit around at the airport all day/etc.",

Our public labor unions are destroying our state.  I tell people from out of state about \"PBA cards\" and it boggles their mind how it can even exist.  I have 2 \"gold cards\" from friends who are cops and any time I get pulled over now, I give the cop my gold cards with my license, and they don't even run my ID or look at my insurance card or anything.  \"Have a good day.\"  My cop friends say that many cops do this so they can basically wash their hands of anything that might be wrong, including DUI, etc.  I don't get how it is even legal for a person to get preferential treatment because they are a friend or family member of a cop.  It's bad enough that cops get preferential treatment.  Also I'm not a cop hater for the record (obviously); I just think this practice is really corrupt (despite me taking part in it).\n\nEDIT: For those who don't know.  A PBA card is a card that cops give to friends/family members that they show to cops when they get pulled over.  It tells the cop that they are a friend/family member of a police officer.  A gold card is made of metal and says \"Family Member - The bearer of this card is an immediate family member of an officer of the _____ Police Department\"  If I was to get a ticket, I would tell my friend/relative that I got a ticket from ____ Police Department, and he/she would talk to the other department or to their union rep. and give them shit about it.\n\nAlso, regular PBA cards are plastic like a credit card and cost something like $5 for the cops to buy from their union rep. They are valid for 1 year although you can still use them past that and cops will sometimes give you a break because of it.  GOLD PBA cards are made of metal and are engraved with your name and they never expire--good for life. They cost the cops something like $20 to buy.  Cops usually give out PBA cards around Christmas time as gifts.",

I'm not exaggerating when I say this:  I have a couple of cop friends who gave out gold cards to our whole group of friends (probably 15-25 people) and none of us have received any tickets in ~10 years.  I've personally been pulled over like 5 or 6 times and not received a single ticket.  In fact, I've never given a cop my gold card and had him even look at my insurance card.  As soon as they see the gold card they say \"Have a great day.\"\n\nMy cop friends even said they never write tickets to anyone with gold cards unless they did something serious.  DUI is where it gets tricky because they can get in deep shit if someone is really drunk and they let them go and they end up hitting and hurting someone.  For speeding and stuff like that, its basically a guarantee you will be let off the hook unless you are an asshole to the cop or something.",

Uber offered a service - \"hey use our app to pick people up and drop them off wherever they want and they'll pay you. You can also work whenever you want!\" and millions of people (me included) thought \"hey, what a great way to bring in some extra income\" and happily went about it. I'm grateful to Uber for giving me the opportunity to make extra money with a vehicle I already owned. And I know many other workers who feel the same way. I don't feel nor see how my rights have been violated at all during my working for Uber. I could have quit working for them at any time. I never had to start in the first place if I didn't want to. Uber simply offered people a way to make extra money and people took it. To be honest if Uber closed down their whole company because they were sick of all the hate they are constantly getting for no reason, I couldn't blame them.",

That is their sole service they provide. \n\nUbers fuckup is trying to dominate all markets at the same time without regard to local laws. There is absolutely no way that Uber that could handle the tens of thousands of districts of jurisprudence within this country let alone across the entire world. \n\nIt is 100% their fault that they did not perform their due diligence. Know what a successful company that shuttles people around is called? A cab company. They get the benefit of working within only one or a few districts. Fleet wide servicing. Negotiated fuel rates.\n\nThe reason why Uber appears to be successful is because they defer all those costs to the state by not paying unemployment or health insurance. And by deferring maintenance and fuel to the drivers.\n\nThere are plenty of drivers that drive 40 hours or more and they get none of the benefits a regular employee would. And according to the state of New Jersey that\u2019s exactly what they are.",

It's an uphill battle for any State to try to have their own classification.\n\nAdditionally, there's nothing keeping the driver's from performing services for Lyft (I believe) or GrubHub or any multitude of other jobs - and there is no set schedule for them to perform work.  These are some reasons why they qualify as independent contractors under IRS rules.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that most cabs operate on a similar model where the drivers actually *lease* their cab from the company they drive for.\n\nIt's a Hail Mary.\n\nThen there's the matter of if the state wins.  Can you imagine the cluster that would make with retroactive claims that could be associated with that?  Forget it.",

This applies even if you are given freedom of action. What matters is that the employer has the legal right to control the details of how the services are performed.\n\nHours worked is one of many factors into whether you're an independent contractor.\n\nUber dictates the cars that people can drive, the routes, and the rates.

At a certain amount of hours you are more of an employee than a contractor. Furthermore, while you can set when you work, Uber (and Lyft) have total control over the amount you are paid and ultimately is the one offering you the rides (effectively clients or projects in contractor speak) you can select. A true contractor seeks out the work and sets out the price. That's not true in this situation.",

On top of that, most drivers report financial improvement because of Uber (and I suspect, many of the drivers are immigrants who have an easier path to income with Uber).\n\nWhat prevents them from being honest independent workers in my mind is that they aren\u2019t told the details of the ride before they take it on. Any independent contractor in my mind agrees on the job being performed with a company before the work is done.

    "postText": "Hello friends,\n\nI'm a non-US person looking to expose myself to short term USD interest rate (fixed income) products. Rates are obviously quite high at the moment and I do not wish to speculate on their future direction.\n\nI've built up a $BIL and $SHY position but I've noticed that my interest payments are subject to withholding tax. This led me to research some alternatives, and one which stood out was $BOXX. This ETF uses box spreads to extricate the short term interest rate from options.\n\nAny downside to this strategy? Any other fixed income strategies which avoid withholding tax? Let me know your thoughts... cheers.",

Never heard of someone getting it back though. \n\n[Here's the dividend's percentages by ETF that get this distinction.](https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/tax-information/qualified-interest-income-qii-percentages-final-2023.pdf)",

You may ask your broker for this, but I have never seen someone get that money back.\n\n&gt; This information relates to Non-Resident Alien (\"NRA\") shareholders and their advisors only. In accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, as extended,\nNRA investors may be exempt from all or a portion of the withholding tax on distributions received from the iShares Funds to the extent attributable to interest-related\ndividends and short-term capital gain dividends. Shareholders may be eligible for a Federal tax refund for the amount of the taxes withheld in excess of the required\namount. The following information sets forth the distributions that were designated by the iShares Funds as exempt from NRA withholding.",

Although I don't know how that works in a brokerage account.\n\nThe use of box spreads should work for you. If you have access to index options with sufficient capital, you could just implement your own box spreads so you are sure of the tax treatment.",

In case you don't have a subscription, here's the relevant paragraph:\n\n&gt; Evergrande\u2019s aggressive debt-fueled plans can work fine when the housing market is booming, but store up trouble for when the market turns. It has also benefited from continuing to delay full recognition of its interest expenses by capitalizing them onto its balance sheet.\n\n&gt; Most Chinese developers do something similar, but most don\u2019t face such a big interest bill: Evergrande capitalized $3.2 billion of interest expenses\u2014over 80% of its bill\u2014in the first half, equivalent to more than the net profit it made during the period. Such delayed interest expenses already show up in the company\u2019s negative cash flow. They will eventually have to be recognized, eating into future earnings.\n\nof course the best source is still the annual report haha",

The reason why people keep buying houses as investments is mostly that they have a lot of money but nowhere to put the money. Many Chinese companies have fairly dubious financials (i.e. accounting fraud is rampant) and the Chinese stock market has been incredibly volatile. There are also a lot of currency controls in China so they can't move money out of the country, and they banned cryptocurrency so people stopped throwing money into wild speculation in that. So it's basically just real estate left.\n\nAt some point there might be a crash, but it could be an incredibly long time from now.",

The Chinese are definitely having some influence but Canadians also love their giant single detached homes on 30 year mortgages or those who got in early and made a killing on speculation. Just because you and I aren't buying them, doesn't mean that others aren't. I know some people in their 50-60s who multiple properties which they sit on until they make the gains they want and then they sell and move the cash to a cheaper market and do the same. Some of these are the parents of kids whom they willingly gift house downpayments; and the cycle continues. Interest rate increases will deflate it somewhat but until we take on speculation and also the NIMBYism which is restricting supply, there wont be affordable housing. ",

Talk to anyone from one of the larger North American cities to see how many Chinese people own a home that either they don't occupy, or they send their kid to school to live in. This is driving the prices of homes up like crazy, to the point that people in that area can no longer afford to even buy a home.\n\n",

Look it up, asian ghost towns, just specifically to park their savings in real estate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIMHO, these ghost towns show an abundance of glut in the real estate market on their end. If something were to happen. Then these extra homes will be useless considering there are TONS of them in these mega cities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could imagine for a while these possible scenarios --- a trade war that would highly affect the conditions in china, a massive decline in the world economy that would no doubt affect china which in turn would lead people to cash in their real estate investments all at once. IF and WHEN people have/develop a fear that they cant sell their real estate immediately or soon then the market will have a rush of people wanting to get out effectively lowering the value of these estates. These are just my ideas.... Im also trying to get away from writing a paper. hahaha",

If you\u2019re a super rich person who can spend $5m+ cash on a second home to indulge in a winter hobby, you go to Aspen where you can hang out with other people like yourself during high season. It\u2019s one of the few housing markets that are literally divorced from local fundamentals such as average income or how much banks are lending etc. And even if the real estate market falls across the USA due to macroeconomic factors, the owners in these town can afford to sit on these expensive houses and wait it out before the market picks up again. Maybe not the housing market, but the stock market where\u2019s there\u2019s a lot of new wealth being made, so these people are willing to pay over the odds for their own ski chalet for socialization/recreation purposes.",

The shadow banking system is an unofficial lender - aka: not a bank or credit union. It relies on a complex system of what is essentially networking and trust called Guanxi. However, the Chinese borrow as much money as they can, knowing if they invest it overseas, they'll have a freehold asset that will always be theirs and cannot be repatriated by the Chinese Government, the banks and away from the reaches of the lender who doesn't have any recourse since it's all underegulated. It's all basically a giant game of musical chairs. They all lend a lot of money to each other. When the music stops (aka: that debt system implodes) they'll just flee to Canada/Australia/USA where they have residency or citizenship and leave behind their debts. It means they'll lose \"face\" and be socially disgraced, but they'll have their millions of USD worth in assets in a safe haven.",

CDOs and CLOs can be thought of as shadow banking (since the ultimate holder are investors). \n\nAccording to this FT article shadow banking is estimated at 45 trillion worldwide, with about 16% coming from China. \n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/c45bf332-1e48-11e8-956a-43db76e69936\n\nWhat happened after 08 was that shadow banking has become way bigger since banks can't have those dodgy loans on their books anymore and need to be super collateralized. Hence the rise of CLOs, which instead of sub prime mortgages, bundles SME loans. \n\nAlso all those crowd funding debt/equity fintech platforms are also part of shadow banking.",

I've read that in Sweden mortgages can be taken out for 100 years out, with the owners only paying the interest and their kids inheriting the property with the mortgage. Any Swedes wanna chip in? In Canada where I'm at the only people I know buying homes are existing home owners or people who've had help from the bank of mom and dad. Somewhat similar situation it seems",

That is not the case today, you can only get a house loan for 85% of the cost, the remaining 15% needs to be financed on your own. You'll have to pay off 2% a year of your loan until you come down to 70%, then you only need to pay 1% a year until your loan is at 50% of the amount you bought the house for. Tough to enter the housing market for us renters... \n\n",

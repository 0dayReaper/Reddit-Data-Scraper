    "postText": "I bought some 9 month CDs about 7 months ago that I was to sell early but don\u2019t fully understand how to calculate the return I would see on those if sold on the secondary market now. I requested a quote for the sale on Friday (that is now expired) and it came back at $99.735 per CD. Does that mean that I\u2019d see a $0.265 loss per $100? Does the buyer get all the interest accrued during the last 7 months? The rate on the CDs is 4.65%.",

            "comment": "That sounds about right.  Buyer gets the payout at maturity, and a buyer can buy something with a better return (around 5.3%) today, so you have to sell yours at a discount to compete.\n\nEdit: Actually this doesn't make sense to me.  If the buyer stands to make $3.48 in 2 months, I'd expect the CD to be priced higher.  Did you buy these for $100 each or are they like t-bills and you bought them for like $96.52 each?",

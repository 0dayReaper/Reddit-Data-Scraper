Now I\u2019m wondering if there is any point to me opening one up at all living in Southern California. I guess I can open a brokerage account anyway but I know I won\u2019t be getting any tax breaks any advice here would be appreciated.",

            "comment": "A 529 plan can still offer valuable tax advantages, even if you can't deduct your contributions on your state or federal income tax return. In a 529 plan, your earnings grow tax-deferred and withdrawals used for qualified education expenses are completely tax-free at the federal level. This can result in significant tax savings over time, especially if you start saving early and let your investments grow for many years.\r  \n\r  \nMoreover, keep in mind that 529 plan assets can be used for a wide range of education expenses, not just college tuition. This includes K-12 tuition, certain apprenticeship costs, and even student loan repayments up to certain limits.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, if the state tax deduction is crucial for your financial strategy and you're comfortable with potential out-of-state investment options, you could consider investing in a 529 plan from another state that does offer a tax deduction. Just be sure to understand the potential drawbacks: some states might require residency to get the tax benefits, and out-of-state plans may have higher fees or less appealing investment options.\r  \n\r  \nAlternatively, if you're looking for a different type of account that offers tax advantages, you might consider a **Roth IRA**. While contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars (so you won't get an immediate tax deduction), the earnings grow tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement. And a bonus, Roth IRAs also offer some flexibility for education savings: you can withdraw your contributions at any time without tax or penalty, and you can withdraw earnings penalty-free (but not tax-free) for qualified education expenses.\r  \n\r  \nAnother option to consider is a **Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA)**, which allows for tax-free distributions for qualified education expenses at both elementary, secondary and higher education institutions. However, there are contribution limits and income restrictions on who can contribute to a Coverdell ESA.",

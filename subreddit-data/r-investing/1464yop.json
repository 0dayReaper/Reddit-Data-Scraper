    "postText": "I am recently retired and never had time when I was younger to learn about investing. I have a 401k managed by Fidelity and a Vanguard Roth IRA. I have never taken anything out of either but am getting to the age where I'm beginning to look at making small withdrawals. My IRA has reached the point where I can make withdrawals without any penalty or tax impact. I still want to make sure that both accounts are growing as I'm only barely past 60. \n\nMy Roth IRA has a current rate of return of 10%. I have it set at 70% stocks and 30% bonds. My 401k has a rate of return of 6.48% and is currently set at 60% stock and 40% bond (i have an order in to change it to 70/30 - the same as my ira). Should I make contributions to my Roth IRA from my 401k? Why/why not?",

So you want to spend down your traditional accounts first to avoid a tax time bomb when your forced to take those withdrawals.",

            "comment": "Mostly bogleheads forum is right for soft or retired investments, just visit there to learn.\n\nMe, just around your age, prefers to move 401k to IRA account as that gives wide opportunity to spread the money to ETFs.\n\nYour 401k may have Roth portion and Traditional portion. You do not need to transfer to Vanguard, but ask fidelity representative to move the complete 401k Traditional to new fidelity  Traditional account (they need to open for you) and move complete 401k Roth to new Fidelity Roth IRA. This moves gives no tax implications as this is direct transfer.\n\nYou can then invest in wide variety of products (focus ETFs to start with) such as QQQ, SMH, SPY, VOO, VTI..etc.\n\nThe only benefit is 401k has limited options given by company plan while IRA has wide plans across the market.\n\n**Up to this point, it is fine**, no issues, no taxes.\n\nHowever, you need to learn **complete investment side(Knoweldge is essential to avoid many pitfalls)**. Never follow any blogs advice, buy some good books from amazon, read, understand and invest.\n\nTo start with, Just buy this used book (below $6) [https://www.amazon.com/Charles-Schwab-Guide-Finances-After/dp/0804137366](https://www.amazon.com/Charles-Schwab-Guide-Finances-After/dp/0804137366)\n\nGood Luck, have safe investment.",

Do you want to get taxed now or later. If the rates are exactly equal, there is no difference. But due to tax rates being progressive, the rates are not the same. You can strategize that based on your personal situation.\n\nIf you don't care to learn, post your current income and how much you plan on retiring on, people will throw out numbers for you and you just have to trust that they're right.",

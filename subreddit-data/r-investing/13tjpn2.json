The lottery is a statistical nightmare so I was thinking maybe there could be a psychology correlated with lottery players that makes them invest or trade with worse performance?",

No.  As long as it doesn't entice you to Yolo everything on one call option, you're probably fine.",

But their reasoning is there is virtually no negative impact on their lives playing $20/year on tickets, but the potential upside if they happen to pick the right numbers/tickets is immense. Those types of people probably going to be fine picking and holding long-term, slow growth stocks.\n\nOn the other hand, people who blow a quarter of their paycheque on scratch tickets every two weeks probably aren't going to be investing at all, because ... well, with what money would they invest?",

If you're buying a ticket occasionally to give yourself a mental escape for a few days where in exchange for $2 you can fantasize about what life would be like with hundreds of millions of dollars - go for it. Consider it part of your entertainment budget.  Same thought process if you pretend it's a long-shot investment in high risk \"lottery futures\" - a $2 \"investment\" on the really remote chance for a huge gain. That being said, if you're buying more than one ticket or expecting a win you're really bad at math.",

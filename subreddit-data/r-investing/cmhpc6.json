The interest you pay against your loan is interest paid into your 401k.  In a good market you lose because the interest rate lags market returns.  In a down market you are ahead as the interest beats losses in the market.   Its only a taxable distribution if you take a loan, terminate employment, and don\u2019t repay the loan from money outside of the 401k.

I think the shortest period allowed by law is 90 days after termination for it to go into default. The remaining outstanding loan balance would then be considered taxable income plus 10% if under 59.5.\n\nOn phone, sorry for typos",

It's actually not that easy to explain *why* it is seen as a bad thing, but stability (if China doesn't maintain their stance) and strategy are the two main given (ie, China effectively imports \"knowledge\" in doing this, by having more firms set up there).",

To offset this, China devalued their dollar making Chinese goods potentially more affordable to America, thus undercutting the tariffs.  Furthermore, this also makes American goods way too expensive for Chinese people to buy. So essentially, Chinese goods will continued to be sold in American but American goods won\u2019t be bought by the Chinese.  I definitely don\u2019t know enough about this sort of thing, but at face value it sounds like a clever move.",

Therefore, US gets 1000 widgets and China gets $10,000 annually. Tariff man puts 10% tariff, meaning Americans now pay $11 per widget, but $1 goes to tariff man (US govt). Americans can't afford all 1000 widgets at that price, so they only buy 800 widgets.\n\nNet result: US gets 800 widgets, China gets $8000, US govt gets $800. China keeps 200 widgets.\n\nScenario B: Now, China devalues its currency because it wants to get rid of ALL of its widgets despite tariff man's 10% tariff. With exchange rates, it now only costs $9 to get a widget. US can once again buy all 1000 widgets for $10 each, but approximately $1 goes to the US govt. \n\nNet result: US gets 1000 widgets, China gets $9000, US govt gets $900. \n\n\nIf you compare net results, scenario A is better for China IF it has another customer to buy those 200 widgets. If, however, those widgets would just sit in a warehouse, then scenario B is better for China.",

Trade wars are invariably wars of attrition, assuming we're dealing with big countries (i.e., neither China nor the U.S. have the ability to entirely crush the other's economy, there are just too many alternative trade partners).  \n\nThe evidence seems to show that the Chinese economy is bleeding slightly faster than the U.S. economy. China, however, has the advantage of an upcoming U.S. election. Voters think short-term. Even if prolonging the trade war would be \"better\" for the U.S. economy overall, China would like to see a Democrat elected who will cease the tariffs and offer short-term \"recovery\" to US citizens without forcing China to make any concessions. This would render the trade war worthless, and mean the economies were essentially crippled for nothing. \n\nChina doesn't have the same pressure from an electorate. I should note, however, that people frequently hyperbolize the lengths to which the Chinese government would go just because they don't have the same election system. Sure, they are willing to take more fascistic measures, but a nation *is* its people, and I think the Chinese government generally does what it considers best for China as a whole (however brutal its decisions may be on individuals, including Chinese citizens). China won't permanently hamstring its own economy just for a \"win\" - its government are still rational actors. \n\nNot-so-bold prediction: China waits out the election cycle. If Trump wins, they buckle because they know he isn't going to let up. If a Democrat wins, they up the pressure and the Democrat cancels the trade war to make Trump look like a failure and to score short-term points.",

It was a legitimate move it obviously raises the price on consumers but it was so the Chinese couldn't take over that market through shady tactics.\n\n\n(For those who don't know) Dumping means to sell something below it's cost of production.  The government was subsidizing the tires to make them so cheap they'd be sold at a loss to make it impossible to compete for US manufacturers. If they outcompeted through efficient processes and better planning there'd be no justification, but this was a temporary hit to try and become a monopolist. I'm not the biggest fan of President Obama (not his biggest hater, either.) , but he made a good call here.",

But then they slowly started allowing it to appreciate (as the market fundamentals suggested it should) as China grew. But market pressures changed due to slowdowns in Chinese productivity and the exchange rate wants to \u201cnaturally\u201d go back down right now.\n\nAs you pointed out, recently China has been doing more to prop it up than push it down. \n\nNow they\u2019ve decided to stop/slow doing those things to prop it up, allowing the exchange rate to move towards where the market wants it. \n\nthe policy change was a conscious choice.  So is the choice to let the market do what it wants and to stop fighting the market a form of manipulation? That seems to be the Trump administration\u2019s argument. \n\nit\u2019s sort of counter to what we consider \u201cmanipulation\u201d to be. To *not* prop it up and to allow the exchange rate slide towards a value more in line with fundamentals seems like the opposite of manipulation to me. \n\nBut they did make a policy change and it resulted in something Trump doesn\u2019t want, so he\u2019s going to argue they did something unfair and bad. \n\nAnd since Americans are stuck in the past, and don\u2019t realize that China\u2019s policy and market pressures have changed quite a bit from the days when China pushed it down, they just assume China is again doing what it used to do.  But back then it was moving against market fundamentals. What happened this week was it moving with market fundamentals (because they opted to ease up the fight against it).\n\nTrump will have a hard time making his case to the people who understand these things. The argument will be, \u201cChina stopped propping up its currency and let the market push it down. That\u2019s manipulation!\u201d It sounds kind of nonsensical. \n\nA lot of Americans will buy it because they assume cheaper Chinese currency is evidence in if itself of manipulation, even if its aligned with market fundamentals. \n\nChina can easily say to the IMF (and to people who understand the current market pressures), \u201chey, you said we should allow the market to do what it wants and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d  That excuse might be a bit disingenuous (as they have their reasons for choosing to make this change now) but it is aligned with the facts.",

I can only guess it's an attempt to devalue the yuan further along with their most recent internal troubles. But anyone who cares should have long gotten out.\n\nThe other weird thing is I believe a devalued yuan would actually strengthen the USD.

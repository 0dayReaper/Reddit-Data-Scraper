    "postText": "I am looking at various bond ETFs and recently saw more offerings around floating rate ETFs.\n\n$BRLN from BlackRock seems interesting.\n\nIt has various risks related to businesses, high-yield bonds, and even some EM exposures, but it seems quite diversified. It provides a 9% yield which is higher than Junk Bonds. It takes into account the current market (recession, raising rates). And yes, the expense fees are not cheap (0.55%).\n\nGiven the relatively short duration (4 years or so), it should do relatively well regardless if the rates stay the same, go up further, or go down.\n\nThoughts? Any other good option for bonds besides $BND, $JNK, $SJNK, $HYEM, and $PHK (much higher risk) and alike?",

Without subordinated bonds to take some of the impact, the loan space could get ugly if defaults pick up as rates stay elevated or continue to rise. MS had a good piece on this last month.",

That is, if interest rates shot up, the payments on the bonds would too, very shortly, so it's as if you're rolling them over in that short interval. The page for [FLOT](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239534/ishares-floating-rate-bond-etf) gives the effective duration as .04 years.\n\nI've had good experiences with that one, btw. Post fee yield of ~5.9% for the past three months, about the same credit quality spread as MMMFs.  The one downside is that it temporarily lost about 2% around the SVB collapse, but recovered in a week or so (used that chance to double down).\n\nBut otherwise, its very very much like a savings-account-as-stock. It's held its value since the time bought in (March 3), while throwing off good dividends.\n\n(Also, I assume you mean FLRN?)",

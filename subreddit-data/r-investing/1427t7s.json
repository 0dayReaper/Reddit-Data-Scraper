    "postText": "20% out of every paycheck goes to a TSP, with my portfolio being split 70% conservative/30% moderately aggressive. \n\n500$ every month goes into a Universal Indexed Life insurance plan.\n\nCurrent savings at 22 is 13,000$. It would've been 20,000$, but I made a bad purchase on a truck that didn't end up well in the middle of last year. I am also about to drop my TSP contributions until I paid off 2,700$ in student loans before interest starts again this summer. I am currently halfway through my military contract. \n\nHow am I looking?",

Growth up to 10% indexed with the S@P 500 with a floor of 0%. Non taxed withdrawals after two years, and I also won't pay taxes on growth from the interest.\n\nYou definitely are making me think on it though. I'll be down 2,000$ if I pull out now.\n\nThe premium isn't 500. I'm contributing 310$ extra to grow the baseline for when it starts accumulating interest.",

            "comment": "Yuck. Our company used to do stuff like this until our financial advisor retired. Then we switched to Vanguard due to lower costs. 100% broad market equities until you are older, then pare it down to 75/25, 60/40, maybe 50/50 if you are risk averse. I probably will never be less than 50% equities ever in my life. Not being exposed to rising dividend payments in retirement is a mistake in my opinion. Need income growth to keep place with inflation and rising expenses later in life.",

Long term compound interest on free Money over 30 years  will far exceed what you pay on a 2700 on a car loan. \nI do think the life insurance isn\u2019t necessary, I didn\u2019t get it until I was 30 and had children, you may have a basic policy through the military. If not usaa has good, cheap rates. \n I also agree with other about the balance in your protfolio. You are young enough? Does military tsp has lifecycle funds? It\u2019s a sit and forget thing,",

What are your other options. \n\n2.  That insurance plan is pure garbage. I can smell it from here. You don\u2019t even need life insurance if your single. Get rid of it ASAP!",

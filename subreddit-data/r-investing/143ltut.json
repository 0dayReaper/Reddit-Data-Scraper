I\u2019ll probably leave it there atleast 10 years, maybe more if I don\u2019t need it. I keep seeing that fxaix will have capital gains and I\u2019m a bit confused how much that is and if voo does too? What\u2019s the difference between a capital gains and normal taxes when it comes to taxable investment income?",

            "comment": "capital gains in a mutual fund are usually higher than an ETF due to how the fund operates. When a large redemption takes place in a mutual fund, the PMs must sell underlying shares to raise money to meet the redemption. They try to do this in a tax efficient manner but an institutional client may redeem more than they can accommodate. This causes the fund to realize capital gains to be passed onto you. ETFs can create/destroy shares via authorized participants instead of having to actually sell the securities and realize any gains. \n\nRebalancing can also trigger capital gains in mutual funds but its less of an issue with index funds like FXAIX since its more predictable. It's more of an issue in active funds with high turnover.\n\nFWIW, FXAIX hasn't had a capital gains distribution in 4 years, I wouldn't worry about it with most index mutual funds.\n\nlong term Capital gains are taxed slightly differently than regular income: https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates",

The fund is a pool money that the fund administrator can then invest on behalf of the members.    The administrator plans to keep a certain amount of cash available in the fund to handle paying bills and some buffer to handle routine redemptions from members.    If the redemption is really big, then the administrator may need to sell stocks to cover the amount the member wants to withdraw from the fund.    When the sale happens the fund itself recognizes a capital gain or loss.    When the fund has a gain or loss, then all the members are subject to recognizing that gain or loss based on how many shares they own of the fund.",

            "comment": "In terms of tax implications, both funds can generate taxable capital gains when they buy or sell securities within the fund. \n\nHowever, the amount of capital gains taxes you'll owe depends on factors such as your income tax bracket and the duration of your investment. \n\nIf you hold the investment for over a year, you may qualify for long-term capital gains rates, which are lower than ordinary income tax rates. \n\nIt's important to note that tax laws can change, so it's best to stay up to date with the latest news.

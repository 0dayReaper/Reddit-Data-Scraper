My local bank is offering 4.5% on 5 month CDs (10k max). \n\nDo y\u2019all see rates going up in the next 5 months or should I just lock in 10 CDs now at this rate and reevaluate in 5 months? Maybe just put a portion into the CDs and see what the Fed does?\n\nAre HYSA as safe as CDs?",

Obviously, the higher the rates, higher the risk, so just making sure if it was worth the extra yield. \n\nDoes it make sense to maybe spread some out and do a few CDs at my local Wells Fargo bank, some CDs at Fidelity with higher rate, and some money into  HYSA? Or just pick the one with highest rate?\n\nAlso, once you purchase a CD, do you know how is it reported on your account? Is the principal amount still being reported or is temporarily missing from your total investments balance until maturity? Is the interest earned once fulfilling the CD or does it accrue?",

The CD interest is considered income, so even if it hasn\u2019t reached maturity, Fidelity will give you a tax form and you will need to pay taxes (Federal and State) on whatever interest accrued.\n\nFun Fact: You can also buy T-Bills which will not be subjected to State Tax (Federal Tax still apply) and you can newly issued ones in Fidelity as well",

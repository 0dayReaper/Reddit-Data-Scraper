    "postText": "Put in my first Treasury auction order via schwab. Auction for 2 month Treasury bill maturing on 8/8. I got the tbill at unit rate of 99.20356. Did the math and it comes out to roughly 4.8%. So I am not sure I got a good deal from this auction because I've been reading that 2 month Treasury bills are getting around 5%. Here is the math :\n((100-99.20356)/99.20356)*100 = 0.80283\n\nAnnualized, this becomes (6 two month periods) :\n\n0.80283 * 6 = 4.817\n\nIs my math off, or did I mess up my auction selection? Either ways, I'm looking for clarifications on whether I did the math wrong or I got a low yield bid.",

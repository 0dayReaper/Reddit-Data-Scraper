Because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new view, to create a fiction.\"\n\n\"Then you call the (Wall Street) Journal and get the bozo reporter in Research in Motion and you would feed that (rival) Palm's got a killer it's going to give away. These are all the things you must do on a day like today, and if you're not doing it, maybe you shouldn't be in the game.\"\n\n\u201cIt might cost me $15 million or $20 million to knock RIM down but it would be fabulous because it would beleaguer all the moron longs who are also keying on Research in Motion.\"\n\n\"A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund ... meaning I needed (a stock) down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It\u2019s a fun game and it\u2019s a lucrative game.\"\n\n\"Who cares about the fundamentals? The great thing about the market is that it has nothing to do with the actual stocks.\"\n\n\\- Jim Cramer, hedge fund manager from 1987-2001, Dec 2006\n\n[Dealbook NY Times Article on Cramer's Interview](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/)\n\n[Investopedia Article: Short and Distort Bear Market Stock Manipulation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D))\n\n[Anatomy of a Short Attack](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#aoh=16119453107704&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Finstablog%2F11442671-gerald-klein%2F3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack)",

I\u2019m 40 years old and if a brokerage just took my money tomorrow, like just straight took it out of my account and said they lost it and there was nothing they could do about it I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.  I think someone much younger would believe America is more just than that, and someone much older would believe there was realistic legal recourse but if you\u2019re about 40 years old and didn\u2019t inherent anything from anyone then you know what I\u2019m talking about.",

My generation (I'm 24) has also grown up with corruption. Only we are 100% aware of it and have been for most of our lives. At least myself and most of the people I know. Granted I've met some people that somehow believe the US is the best country ever and they are blind to everything. Think along the lines of the kids raised by die hard Trump supporters. Those people are brainwashed as fuck. I'm new to the market by a few months, and I came in expecting Manipulation and corruption and I'm honestly doing fucking incredible lol. Feels good beating the rich at their own game, or at least keeping up and holding my own",

Not going to lie it didn\u2019t even feel like John was finding his own until the 4th quarter of that Bush/Gore campaign, and then the show took off.\n\n\nThe Daily Show is now basically what is was before John Stewart, which is a good show, but not transformational.",

I think that he is a part of a problem in a sense, but in a lot of ways he's a relatively minor part of the problem simply because he's willing to be up-front about it.  \n\n* A major problem with TV news is access.  If you want to do news you need access.  That means that at some point you need to tow the line.  I see this all over the place - want a review copy of a product or book or movie or whatever, well, your integrity is only allowed to go so far.  \n\n* Another major problem with TV news is entertainment.  We want to be entertained.  Stewart is an example of where this works well, but he is just providing the criticism and not the education/solution side.  The education part is REALLY hard to sell unless you do the Cramer thing.    \n\n* The real world is always more complex than what fits in a tweet.  The details of how settlement and so on get really boring really fast, and that is how this nonsense thrives.  You can't just make the whole system cash and carry, and everybody tunes out once you get past that, which means that the system is allowed to run itself.  That is how we end up with GME being shorted 150%.",

(Legit question)\n\nALWAYS think about where a company makes their money.\n\nCNBC makes money from being entertaining, NOT giving sound financial advice. They could care less whether what they're saying makes any sense, as long as you're watching.\n\nNear as I can tell, we still to this day do not have consistent and quality financial journalism. Hedge funds are the ones making actual money off legitimately knowing what's going on, and they make SO MUCH MORE than anything else they could do, there's an extreme disincentive to sharing that knowledge or knocking their own house down.\n\nr/wallstreetbets, for better or worse, is essentially a crowdsourced hedge fund. The only issue is the peasants figured out how to play the game.\n\nNothing has changed fundamentally since this interview Jon ran on Jim almost 12 years ago, and unfortunately there's still no one blowing the whistle on anything.",

No one on Wall Street actually cares about them because it's such a small stock! But also, Redditors are going to crash the economy if they keep buying it up! \n\n- Really, RH restricted buys to protect the small traders, and the current trade volume is too high so we have to pause it. But no, we won't restricted other volatile markets because we believe in the free market, and we're not going to halt SALES because that would be unfair!\n\n- GME is just a pump and dump and you're stupid for buying into it. But have you thought about selling all your GME and buying NOK instead? How about BB or AMC?",

But they're leverage 10:1 on the long side too. So they need to sell way more than $19B's worth of securities to come up with the margin/cash to fund the short position on GME.\n\nOversimplifying a lot here but that feels like it could be happening given the \"degrossing\" we're seeing in the broader market.",

It's a play called a \"short ladder\" (I'm new to all of this but hell if I'm not learning a ton these last few weeks!)I'm still baffled at how disgusting these moves are... and I'd wager it's far from over.\n\nEdit to add what short ladder attack is:\n\nSay price of XYZ stock is $400/share.\n\nHedge A sells shares of XYZ stock to Hedge B for $390. Hedge B sells shares of XYZ stock back to Hedge A for $380. They ping pong back and forth on an extremely rapid pace, making it appear that the new price per share is far lower than the market value previously was. This spooks the hell out of people who are worried about losing their entire investment and they sell (probably at a loss), Hedges scoop up shares they've shaken out and the price rises back to it's regular level when they're done.",

Just pointing out that it wasn't just one broker shutting it down causing the entire selloff. \n\nI also think part of it may have been a short ladder effect, but moreso that there was a massive liquidity issue (essentially one of the bigger precursors to what would have been a short squeeze). \n\nFidelity has its own clearing house, and I think Vanguard too, at least those two I could even still buy call options, let alone shares, when people were shut out.",

Admittedly Vanguard and Fidelity likely have much larger clearing houses and are able to back up buys, but it is extremely suspicious that ONLY platforms with direct business relations with Citadel suddenly have liquidity problems and platforms that stand to benefit from this have no issue at all processing your buy. \n\nWhile Robinhood and the other brokers provided an ok reasoning for cutting off buys, I think it's still a clear cut case of market manipulation in the intent of the law if not the word. If suddenly all of these brokers are having liquidity issues, shouldn't the SEC halt ALL trades of GME until it's sorted? The only benefit of the buy restriction was that hedge funds were able to escape some of their extremely bad short positions in the 100$ range while everyone else suffered. \n\nDefinitely seems intentional and wee bit too coincidental. Although Citadel is so large it's hard to escape having some kind of business relationship with them.\n\nEdit: to be fair I don't know a LOT about the whole deal but like my nan always said. If it looks like a fish swims like a fish drinks like a fish and tastes like a fish .... it's not chicken.",

If the current shorts entered their short positions with GME at $300 they can afford to pay interest for months without eating into their profits too badly. Long term upside is something like $250/share, and 30% interest on the share price is only like $0.25/day. In that case we might need another catalyst to kick off an infinity squeeze. Without another price increase to cause margin calls they can probably afford to wait us out. Sadly Thursday really put the brakes on this whole thing.",

Most of your bosses didn't get their positions because of their talent but often because of their connections or money.\n\nI could go on, but my point is that life isn't fair and while it's a noble societal endeavor to try to make things fairer, as an individual if you want to compete at the top 1% percent at anything in life you need to identify and be willing to exploit your unfair advantages.\n\nI'm not even saying people shouldn't be mad at this, but just don't be surprised to find out stuff like this is happening because it will make you a bitter person. Life isn't fair and it never will be. It's actually surprising to me that an investment community is shocked by this. The reason Reddit won their battle this week is because they used their unfair advantage as one of the largest communities on the internet to orchestrate a global movement to attack a few random hedgefunds. You think I as an individual can screw over a hedge fund like Reddit did this week? Nope, and perhaps that's not fair either, but it was pragmatic. And that's all that really matters.",

He's not a licensed financial advisor. \n\nI\u2019m surprise this isn\u2019t more well known.\n\nYou have to also understand that he ran a hedge fund during a very different time. This is how hedge funds were back then. He even mentions the good old days of hedge funds on air, and this is what he\u2019s referring to. \n\nHedge funds often serve a different purpose now, and it\u2019s not always to beat the s&amp;p as what he\u2019s referring to in this video.\n\nWe still have the likes of them to an extent, and many still deal in high risk, borderline illegal, and highly unethical practices, but you have to understand that unless you go full Enron, Madoff, or even just pull a Martha Stewart, you\u2019re usually not looking at possible time in jail. If the losses can\u2019t be tied to a Ponzi scheme where you\u2019re robbing your own clients, or making illegal sales from your own company, it\u2019s a very grey area that some people consider to be just part of how things work. \n\nIf you stick to something like VTI, VT, and so forth, all of this is a nothing blip in the infinite variability of the entire market, and shouldn\u2019t cause you more harm than any one who isn\u2019t a speculator. \n\nJust remember, Jim is there for entertainment. If you\u2019re getting your investment ideas for picking individual stocks from CNBC and not a reputable financial advisor, you\u2019re going to butt heads with these people. If buy and hold in good companies is your plan, and you limit speculating to a very small fraction of your worth, these issues are mostly irrelevant. \n\nAnyways, he's an actor. He says he reads Reddit (Wall Street bets) regularly, and we all know that's a lie, aside from maybe an intern showing him a post or two.\n\nBasically, CNBC is not a good source for speculative trading advice. The guy literally hates on ETFs one day, and in the next breath tries to qualify his opinion by saying that yes, the broad ETFs are something everyone should own some of....\n\nJim is also NOT licensed in any form that I'm aware of, regarding financial advice. He also graduated from Harvard law and passed the board, but he's not a lawyer. Keep in mind that he is 100% not there to make your rich. He's there to sell advertising spots.",

But I also realize that, as the everyman he just wants to have a nice retirement and do what he wants as well.   I don't begrudge him that...\n\nBut *fucking god we need someone like him right now*.\n\nWe need someone with his combination of ability, eloquence, and *outrage* to get these people on their show and not hold their feet to the fire, but *set them on fire*.\n\nHis Crossfire Interview was legendary... When he took on two pundits on their home turf and beat them both like fucking rabid animals.\n\nChris Cuomo is fine... But he doesn't have the same *je ne sais quoi*.   He doesn't have the same background or ability to make things accessible.  He doesn't seem to have the same ability to take Main Street's problems and force people in the halls of power to confront them.",

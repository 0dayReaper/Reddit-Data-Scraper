M1 High-Yield Savings Accounts are furnished by B2 Bank, NA, Member FDIC.* \n\nSo M1 just partners with a bank , that bank is FDIC insured so its safe up to 250k\n\nAs far as M1 brokerage its registered with FINRA\n\n[https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/281242](https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/281242)\n\nand its a member of SIPC\n\n[https://www.sipc.org/list-of-members/](https://www.sipc.org/list-of-members/)",

The first and the 3rd accounts tend to be allocate your contributions to index mutual funds. Many at r/stocks and similar subs have lost money trying to trade/invest in individual stocks. I recommend just checking out how target date funds and organized and reading books such as [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Common-Sense-Investing/dp/B077VYLVGP/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=little+book+common+sense+investing&amp;sr=8-1).

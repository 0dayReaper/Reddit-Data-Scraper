    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI\u2019m building a investment portfolio for the next 15-20 years on bonds and was wondering if it\u2019s a good idea to include corporate bonds. I\u2019m looking for low risk with constant returns.\n\nI was thinking of doing like 80% treasury, 10% Disney and another 10% in Boeing.\n\nNot too sure if the risk is worth the gain though.\n\nAny online tools that can help me with this?",

    "postText": "I am early on in my career. I just finished my undergraduate degree and I'm getting ready to start my first job. I plan to spend one or two decades in the US before moving over to Europe, either set up a company in Europe, set one in the US with a European branch, or work for a US company in Europe. I'm a citizen of the US and a country in the EU, so also part of the European Union. In my first couple years ahead, my job will involve a lot of traveling, and I do plan to do a year or two working for my company's branch abroad in Europe (I will be likely specializing in European markets and already building a European client base from the US in my 20s). I am about to set up my investment, retirement, and savings account as I take on my first job. Which brokerages should I consider keeping accounts with and investing with considering that long term I want to move and retire in Europe (ideally Europe but open to anywhere else abroad.)   What advice do you have? I really appreciate it.  I heard Schwab is quite good with global transfers, but I am quite unsure",

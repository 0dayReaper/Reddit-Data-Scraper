    "postText": "I\u2019m 17 living in Eastern Europe\n\n\u200bI'm 17 years old, 11th grade turning 18 in september. Right now I've about \u20ac500 saved, and after the end of the school year, which will be in about 2 weeks, I plan to go abroad this summer to work for a family member in the US (an opportunity granted to me by my parents). According to the calculations I've made, I should receive between $8000 and $14000. I don't plan on spending more than $1000 of that, and I've been looking for a way to invest that money for a long time. Since I'm still in school next year and I'm an athlete, I won't be working at home for at least a year, if not longer (I live with my parents). I've been looking into crypto, stocks, and VTI. Many people advised me against investing in crypto, and VTI seems pretty slow and inefficient for this small amount of money. (1k per year out of the 8k) and I'd like to try something riskier. Stocks might be the way to go, but there seems to be so many options that I just don't know what to do. Can anyone help me or guide me where I should invest this amount of money?",

            "comment": "I would probably put it into VTI and start learning and reading books about investing. Also, think about what you want to do with that money you invested?\n\nBeing an athlete you should know, the training you do is for a specific purpose, a competition, the Olympics etc. You don't just go for a random run or work out whenever. Your effort needs to be done thoughtfully with a goal in mind. You plan out your workouts with plans to hit certain numbers, then you do the training to get there.\n\nSame thing with your investment. Think about what is your plan with that money, what numbers are you expecting to reach and in what time? Based on these questions I would evaluate what risk level I am willing to take.\n\nBut remember that joke: \"My risks are calculated, but man, I am bad at math\".\n\nJust because you acknowledge your risk, it doesn't mean that you're safe.\n\nTL;DR - put it in VTI, learn about investing by following the market and understanding how your portfolio value changes based on how market evolves (news, earnings, sector development, geopolitical crisis etc.)\n\nPS: I'm from Eastern Europe too",

But TQQQ is triple leveraged QQQ.  So, you essentially get three times the bang for the buck.  But here are the problems. The glaring problem is if TQQQ goes down, you are take 3x the losses.  (By the way, SQQQ is a triple-leverage short, so you make money when QQQ goes down).  The other is that there is a small amount of decay in this instrument, so if the NASDAQ is moving sideways, you are probably losing some money. Still, if you think that NASDAQ is going up, then TQQQ is a riskier bet with more rewards if your are right.  \n\nNote: My personal advice for you being 17 is VTI or a something slow and stable like that.  The risk you should take in life is starting your own business.  That has the highest potential for reward and it is most within your control.  Investments should be a medium-risk deal until you get to be old.  90-95% of your investments should be in something \"boring\".  One day, you'll wake up and be 40.  And your 40 year old self will thank your 17 year old self if you just keep pumping your money into boring investments.  If you are dying to play with crypto or other high risk things, do it with money you can afford to lose.  You will learn valuable lessons.  But it's better to learn those without losing all you money.",

Also, keep in mind, the vast majority of my wealth is in boring stuff.  TQQQ less than 5% of my wealth and my options trades are less than 5% of that (because I'm not a pro).

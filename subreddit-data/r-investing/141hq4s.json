    "postText": "From bloomberg: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-06-04/us-effort-to-help-homebuyers-get-affordable-loans-mainly-benefits-banks-instead\n\n&gt;The first sign of deep trouble in US banking this year came from a sunbaked office complex in a San Diego suburb. There, a small firm called Silvergate Capital Corp. assured investors it was weathering a run on deposits. Its lifeline: about $4.3 billion from a Federal Home Loan Bank.\n\n&gt;Heads turned across the financial industry.\n\n&gt;Silvergate didn\u2019t have a network of branches serving consumers, and it barely offered mortgages. It specialized in moving dollars for cryptocurrency ventures. \n\n&gt;Soon it became apparent that a roster of troubled regional banks was leaning on FHLBs \u2014 a relic of the Great Depression originally aimed at ensuring financial firms have cash to lend to homebuyers. Yet the banks had little to do with everyday mortgage lending. \n\n&gt;Silicon Valley Bank, catering to venture capitalists and tech startups, said it held $15 billion from an FHLB at the end of 2022. Signature Bank, with clients including crypto platforms, had $11 billion. And by April,  First Republic Bank, offering mortgages to millionaires on unusually sweet terms, ended up with more than $28 billion. All four banks collapsed.\n\n&gt;For many, that was a crystallizing moment for the 90-year-old Federal Home Loan Bank system, which has ballooned to more than $1.5 trillion while playing a growing role as a backstop for banks taking all kinds of risks \u2014 and a diminishing role in funding new mortgages. That\u2019s raising questions about the purpose of FHLBs and why the private institutions enjoy so much government support.\n\n&gt;This look at the system is based on interviews with more than 30 current and former FHLB officials, overseers, borrowers and other market participants, most of them speaking on the condition they not be named to candidly discuss confidential experiences. Many described an environment where loans are made quickly with little due diligence, generating billions of dollars a year in profits for FHLBs and the banks they serve \u2014 plus millions of dollars in bonuses and other compensation for their own executives.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s hard to imagine the Federal Reserve rewarding bosses for arranging industry bailouts, but that is in effect what now happens at FHLBs.\n\n&gt;The FHLB of San Francisco, for example, more than doubled its assets last year as Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic and others embarked on their borrowing binges. Its chief executive officer, Teresa Bazemore, was awarded $2.4 million \u2014 much of it in bonuses \u2014 during 2022, her first full year atop the institution. SVB and First Republic now rank as the second- and third-largest bank failures in US history.\n\n&gt;Bazemore's pay was tied to goals and other metrics the San Francisco FHLB's board set in consultation with a third-party expert and showed to regulators, said Elliot Sloane, a spokesperson for the San Francisco FHLB. \u201cThe level of advances to a member is based on a careful, thoughtful and conservative underwriting approach that takes all the relevant risk factors into account. That is our congressionally directed function,\u201d Sloane said.\n\n&gt;Many of the largest banks also have become accustomed to drawing financing from FHLBs, even as they pull back from lending to US homebuyers.\n\n&gt;Wells Fargo &amp; Co., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc. \u2014 among the system\u2019s biggest users since 2010 \u2014 collectively tapped at least $62 billion during last year\u2019s relatively sedate markets. Citigroup\u2019s $19 billion amounted to 3% of the total cash pool, while the firm originated only 0.3% of the nation\u2019s mortgages in 2022, according to bank regulatory filings and federal mortgage records. Wells Fargo borrowed $32 billion before announcing in January that it\u2019s slashing mortgage operations.\n\n&gt;The lion\u2019s share of US home loans are instead issued by nonbanks, such as Rocket Mortgage, which sell them to free up cash to make new loans. \n\n&gt;Those businesses generally aren\u2019t eligible to tap the FHLB system.\n\n&gt;More than 80% of the top 100 FHLB users borrowed more from the system than they loaned out as mortgages. Fourteen banks reported no originations.\n\n&gt;One quirk of the system is that the government\u2019s assistance doesn\u2019t appear as a line in the US budget \u2014 sparing FHLBs the kinds of bitter congressional debates over expenditures that have gripped Washington in recent months.\n\n&gt;Instead, government support starts with special treatment, giving FHLBs an edge in raising money cheaply. They gather most of their funding by selling bonds exempt from state and local income taxes. Buyers are also more comfortable with the debt because of the widespread assumption that if an FHLB ever runs into trouble, the government would jump in with taxpayer money to prevent default. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s have said their credit ratings for the FHLB system would be several notches lower if not for the government's presumed backing.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe implied guarantee is also not something that's conveyed by the government,\u201d Ryan Donovan, CEO of the Council of Federal Home Loan Banks, said in an interview. \u201cIt's something the market perceives, that we're a safe place, that our debt that we issue is solid.\u201d\n\n&gt;Economists vigorously debate the value of the government\u2019s support. Defenders of the system, such as former White House adviser Jim Parrott and economist Mark Zandi, estimate it was worth around $5 billion last year, while detractors peg the boost closer to $9 billion. Some of that is passed on to banks as a discounted source of financing. It also translates into higher profits for the FHLBs, which last year produced $3.2 billion in net income.\n\n&gt;They held on to more than half that, lifting their stockpile of retained earnings to $24.6 billion.\n\n&gt;A portion \u2014 about $1.4 billion \u2014 was paid banks and other \u201cmembers\u201d as dividends. \n\n&gt;In the end, the $1.5 trillion FHLB system contributed a mere $355 million to a program supporting housing affordability last year.\n\n&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d said Cornelius Hurley, an independent director on the board of Boston\u2019s FHLB for about 14 years through 2021. \u201cThis is a public entity. We should be demanding more from them.\u201d\n\n&gt;Defenders acknowledge that the system is a quirk of history but say its ability to provide funding quickly is crucial, especially when crises erupt. FHLBs can start stabilizing lenders before they resort to tapping the Fed\u2019s discount window, and before policymakers can meet to discuss other extraordinary measures.\n\n&gt;Banks that do tap the discount window have to worry about stoking the very same public panic they are trying to quell.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe members certainly could go to the Fed,\u201d said Michael Ericson, CEO of the Chicago FHLB. \u201cThe challenge is there is a reputation risk associated with that. In talking with member institutions, they feel that the stigma is real.\u201d\n\n&gt;FHLBs didn\u2019t always provide cash so freely. The system was almost comically risk-averse when President Herbert Hoover signed the law for its creation in 1932. In the first two years, hopeful borrowers filled out 41,000 applications for mortgages funded with FHLB money. Three were approved.\n\n&gt;Back then, thrifts and insurers were the biggest lenders to homebuyers. The firms were supposed to go to local FHLBs and pledge collateral \u2014 such as home loans \u2014 to borrow cash and make additional mortgages.\n\n&gt;But by the late 1930s, Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s administration was creating an even simpler system: A new entity, Fannie Mae, would buy mortgages. About three decades later, Congress chartered Freddie Mac to help thrifts manage interest-rate risks. The pair gave rise to the mortgage-securities market, which funds most home loans today.\n\n&gt;But in the 1980s, the savings and loan crisis erupted, prompting a government bailout. With so many thrifts failing, the FHLBs were losing too many members to sustain themselves. So in 1989, George H.W. Bush\u2019s administration reached a deal to expand the FHLB system to serve thousands of banks \u2014 on the condition that 10% of profits would go toward supporting housing affordability.\n\n&gt;FHLBs fought that requirement at the time, people involved in that process said. They now tout it as a core piece of their mission.\nSticking to the Mandate\n\n&gt;FHLBs have to set aside 10% of their profit for affordable housing grant programs. They rarely do more.\n\n&gt;The number of lenders using FHLBs more than doubled to more than 8,000 by 2005 \u2014 while the system\u2019s balance sheet swelled about sixfold to $1 trillion.\n\n&gt;But after the 2008 financial crisis, the nation\u2019s largest banks began pulling back en masse from mortgage lending.\n\n&gt;Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Citigroup collectively originated 4% of residential mortgages in the country in 2022, down from 13% in 2010. Rocket Mortgage increased its market share over the same period.\n\n&gt;Still, FHLBs continued to swell as banks sought financing, especially in emergencies. The system\u2019s total loans to members surged 28% to $1.04 trillion in this year\u2019s first three months, beating a record set in the third quarter of 2008.\n\n&gt;\u201cWhat the home loan banks have become is a source of general liquidity to big banks,\u201d said Bruce Morrison, former chair of the Federal Housing Finance Board. \u201cThey\u2019ve made a great contribution for the last 50 years, but the market has changed. They\u2019re doing a job that the Fed should be doing.\u201d\n\n&gt;Most Americans aren\u2019t familiar with the arcane system.\n\n&gt;A software engineer from a think tank recently went on National Public Radio\u2019s \u201cThe Indicator\u201d to take a quiz about this year\u2019s turmoil in US banking. Asked to identify the industry\u2019s \u201clender of second-to-last resort\u201d from a list, she paused on the correct answer: the FHLB system.\n\n&gt;\u201cSounds made-up,\u201d she said.\n\n&gt;When deposit runs at regional banks began making headlines around the world in March, few eyes were on the FHLBs as they furiously raised money to meet the incoming demand to aid banks, issuing $304 billion of debt in one week alone.\n\n&gt;\u201cPeople underestimate how much value they bring,\u201d said Ted Tozer, the former president of Ginnie Mae. \u201cThe record number of advances this year when there was contagion shows a lot of it happens under the covers. The FHLBs are the shock absorbers.\u201d\n\n&gt;FHLBs can react so quickly because it\u2019s hard for them to lose. They have a so-called super lien on the money they lend, putting them at the front of the line to get repaid if a bank collapses. The FHLBs note that any secured lender would take priority in the event of a bank failure.\n\n&gt;But insiders say the super lien contributes to features of FHLB loans that can make them especially egregious. It's not uncommon for banks to bend accounting rules to get bigger advances. There's also little incentive to do thorough due diligence.\n\n&gt;\u201cYou can look at who they are lending to and see it\u2019s not because they\u2019re doing a good job screening for bank quality,\u201d said Kathryn Judge, a Columbia Law School professor who focuses on financial regulation. \u201cIt\u2019s a byproduct of the fact there\u2019s a mechanism in place to protect their interests.\u201d\n\n&gt;Two people who worked in different FHLBs for more than a decade said they never saw a loan turned down, no matter how poor the financial health of an institution. What matters, they said, is getting collateral \u2014 US Treasuries, home loans, mortgage-backed securities and other real estate assets.\n\n&gt; **Though banks often have to pledge more collateral than they borrow, they have found ways to maximize the value of that collateral. Normally, firms label assets they intend to hold short term as \u201cavailable for sale.\u201d If the value of those assets fall in the market, the bank marks them down on its books and takes an immediate hit to its earnings. **\n\n&gt; **But firms may avoid markdowns by moving assets to a longer-term accounting bucket dubbed \u201cheld-to-maturity.\u201d That allows them to preserve the value of collateral they present when borrowing from an FHLB.**\n\n&gt; **Charles Schwab Corp.\u2019s banking arm shifted $189 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities to that category last year. The firm borrowed $12.4 billion from the FHLB system through the end of 2022, and had the capacity to borrow $68.6 billion, according to an annual report. In the first quarter of 2023, its FHLB loans more than tripled.**\n\n&gt;The FHLBs don\u2019t track how banks use their financing. The lifelines can help troubled banks avoid fire sales of assets. But if a firm\u2019s balance sheet is in bad shape, collateralized lending may do little more than postpone the bank\u2019s inevitable demise, potentially letting losses worsen. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is left to clean up the mess.\n\n&gt;\u201cThat delay makes a difference,\u201d said Judge, the law professor. \u201cFresh liquidity allows them to limp on longer rather than evaluate their own viability.\u201d\n\n&gt;After the Fed embarked on a rapid series of rate hikes early last year, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic watched their assets lose value and their financial condition worsen until depositors panicked and FHLB lifelines were no longer enough. The FDIC estimates their failures will cost its main insurance fund more than $31 billion, including coverage of uninsured deposits that will be paid by a special assessment on the industry.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, the FHLBs and their lobbying arm boast that they\u2019ve never had a loss on a loan in more than eight decades.\n\n&gt;Large banks borrow from many sources, sometimes including more than one FHLB, putting the regional hubs under pressure to compete for business. A former official described how one of the nation\u2019s four giant commercial banks played regional FHLBs off of each other, scoring better rates and terms.\n\n&gt;Earlier this year, the FHLB of Chicago announced a sweetener for its members: \u201cEarly bird discounts.\u201d\n\n&gt;Through May 31, the FHLB promised better rates for loans given before 10 a.m. Banks could also get \u201cvolume discounts\u201d if they took out advances larger than $100 million, according to its website.\n\n&gt;Such gamesmanship irks policy advocates such as Aaron Klein, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cNo banks should be able to arbitrage the FHLBs against each other,\u201d he said. \u201cMembers should only be allowed one.\u201d\n\n&gt;Chicago FHLB\u2019s Ericson said that enticing members to come in the morning helps with planning and that it\u2019s increasingly common for banks to borrow from just one FHLB.\n\n&gt;Last year, the FHLB\u2019s overseer \u2014 the Federal Housing Finance Agency \u2014 announced it would conduct a sweeping review of the system to consider whether it needs to be dramatically reshaped. The agency\u2019s director, Sandra Thompson, later signaled dissatisfaction: \u201cThe status quo is not acceptable,\u201d she said at a Brookings symposium in February.\n\n&gt;But in the wake of March\u2019s regional banking blowup, Biden administration regulators have been emphasizing the importance of FHLBs in stabilizing the industry\u2019s balance sheets. \u201cThrough this period of market stress, the FHLBanks remained in a safe and sound condition and continued to serve their critical role,\u201d Thompson told a congressional panel in May.\n\n&gt;Her agency\u2019s recommendations are expected later this year.\n\n&gt;Some FHLBs are starting to voluntarily pay 50% more than required to housing affordability, and others are in the process of doing so, Donovan wrote to Thompson in March. That would raise their contribution to 15% of their profits.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, there\u2019s a measure for consideration in Congress that would boost it to 20%. Housing advocates say that\u2019s not enough, arguing that improving affordability should be a more central part of the business model than carving off a slice.\n\n&gt;That wouldn\u2019t include offering better financing terms to Community Development Financial Institutions, which fill gaps in lending to communities, such as minorities or people with low incomes or living in rural areas. The organizations often have to put up more collateral than banks and have a harder time accessing funding even though they more directly address affordability.\n\n&gt;The FHLBs now have around 6,800 members. About 1% are CDFIs. At the same time, more than 500 insurers, including giants like MetLife Inc. that no longer play a pivotal role in housing, are some of the system\u2019s biggest borrowers. On its website, investment firm Wellington Management urges insurers to burnish their profits by drawing even more FHLB money for leverage.\n\n&gt;\u201cYou can be outraged but the outrage is in their purpose,\u201d said Morrison, the former Federal Housing Finance Board chair. \u201cThe question is whether we really need this huge trillion-dollar institution or if they should be restyled. They serve a private purpose with public subsidy.\u201d",

They were aware that banks which shouldn\u2019t have had access to these funds were qualifying to use it in order to shore up their balance sheets. \n\nI think that likely played a role in the fed/treasury offering to allow banks to sell their current treasuries or trade them in at the non depreciated amount awhile back as well. \n\nBasically if they had 1B worth of 1% treasuries that were now worth 700MM due to rising rates, they were allowed to sell them back for the full amount they paid. \n\nThe two events could be unrelated, but they both happened within a few days of each other so they definitely seemed related to each other.",

We tried that in 2008. The financial system shut down, nobody could get loans. Asset firesales. Layoffs in the 10s of thousands per company.

They probably paid half that about six years ago. I know the new buyers had some sort of a mortgage, as they said this year \"had we tried to buy it now, we couldn't have afforded it.\"\n\nWe are in a very HCOL area, and while home prices are still way up, they are coming down as rates are really high and it's hard to sell or buy with these high rates in our area.  We bought a very similar house in 2019, but all cash, no mortgage. We are still way up, and aren't worried, it's our home, not an \"investment\" in our minds.\n\nWith rates and inflation so high, banks are having trouble generating revenue from mortgages, and MBS are still a thing, so it's a really odd situation where it's neither a sellers or buyers market, and it's causing a liquidity crisis for the banks, so instead of this money helping consumers afford houses, it went to banks to \"fill the gap\" so to speak.\n\nI am happy to be corrected if wrong.",

If your circle of acquaintances includes people over 25 or so, you can see how ridiculous the idea is.\n\nIn reality, 50% of people have more than 3 months of expense saved:\n\nhttps://www.bankrate.com/f/102997/d645adeb42/20220623-june-fsp.pdf\n\n(With 27% having 6+ months of savings, 22% having 3-5 months of savings, 28% having less than 3 months of savings, and 23% having no savings).\n\nOf course the problem is that new media are misleading to profoundly dishonest when they cover these topics because bad news gets more engagement. \n\nBut - particularly if you are someone who invests - you can't blindly believe that things you read on the internet are true. *Especially* if they correspond to your pre-existing beliefs, like Americans are particularly bad with money. \n\nHere's the most egregious example, repeated every year, and gobbled up by credulous \"digital natives\" on reddit.\n\n[56% of Americans can\u2019t cover a $1,000 emergency expense with savings](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/19/56percent-of-americans-cant-cover-a-1000-emergency-expense-with-savings.html).\n\nThis is the story everyone has heard. Here's the source and the repeated claim from within the body:\n\n&gt;Some 56% of Americans are unable to cover an unexpected $1,000 bill with savings, according to a telephone survey of more than 1,000 adults conducted in early January by Bankrate.\n\nOkay, clear enough. But what does the Bankrate study say?  \n\nWell, not that. Not that at all. Here:\n\nhttps://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/emergency-savings-report/\n\n&gt;Only 43% of U.S. adults would pay for an unexpected emergency expense from their savings.\n\nThe study never claims that the adults *couldn't* pay for the unexpected expense. None of these oft-repeated studies claim that. It is *always* what the person would do, not what they could or couldn't do. The earlier, more academic studies, made this point explicit. \n\nThe study also shows us this:\n\n&gt;25% of people would accrue credit card debt to pay for a $1,000 emergency expense and pay it off over time.\n\nPut together, plus using some math, these two things tell us that: (1) 57% of Americans would put an unexpected $1,000 expense on a card; (2) 32% of Americans would pay the card off that same month; and (3) 25% of people would put the debt on a card and roll the debt over. \n\nMeaning, clearly, that 75% of Americans can afford an unexpected $1000 expense because they would either pay it from savings or put it on a card that they would pay off the same month. Notice how much work it was to dig out this important fact?\n\n25% of Americans *may* still have enough in savings to pay off the unexpected emergency - but if they do, it's probably fair to say that their expenses are precarious enough that they would prefer to pay some amount of interest to avoid using their savings (if they do have savings).\n\n\nOf course the news isn't all good; the people reporting having no savings are of course a cause of concern. But these articles have us worrying about things that aren't the issue, which makes it hard to focus on the actual issue.\n\nAnd while I've broken the report down, it's *really tedious* to tease out the actual facts from the persistent negative spin (or, in the case of the CNBC report, the actual dishonesty). They bury the lede that half of Americans have three months of savings (and over a quarter 6+ months of savings), while also presenting misleading data suggesting that over half of Americans can't afford an unexpected $1000 expense.  (Where, as noted above, in reality 75% of Americans can afford the expense, including many who would put it on the card).\n\nIt's further obfuscated by the negative sounding but ultimately confusing formulations comparing present savings to past savings in a manner that sounds like an Algebra I question.\n\nAnd don't get me started on all of the dishonest \"paycheck-to-paycheck\" reports.",

The catch was that these mortgages were Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs)... so they were low when these subprime borrowers initiated the loans.\n\nBut then the economy was starting to overheat during the Bush era, so the Fed had to increase interest rates, and quickly. As the Fed interest rate went up, so did the rates for these ARMs. After a few years, people with ARMs were paying 50% more in their monthly mortgage rates, in contrast to their jobs that were still paying near-minimum wage.\n\nSince these people didn't care about their credit score, they simply stopped paying their mortgages. Banks seized their homes via foreclosure and then tried to recoup their losses via auctions on the cheap. Since this increased supply, home values dropped rapidly, which caused even more people with ARMs to realize their mortgages were underwater, which caused more foreclosures, which caused even lower home values, which caused more foreclosures, etc etc.\n\nThe reason this won't happen today is two-fold. One, we got rid of that Clinton-era subprime requirement, so banks today are extremely strict with who they lend to. Monthly income is a significant factor in whether you'll get approved for a mortgage, as well as credit score. This means people are less likely to default, since they've been guaranteed to have a steady income AND they actually cared about protecting their credit score. \n\nTwo, the vast majority of loans today are fixed-rate. As the Fed increases interest rates, it will have the exact opposite effect compared to if they were ARMs. Not only will my 3% rate remain at 3% while the current rate is 7%, but also, I DON'T WANT TO sell my home else I'll replace that 3% with a 7%.\n\nThis means that instead of massive foreclosures increasing the supply of available homes on the market, we'll actually DECREASE that number, which in theory should drive home values higher.\n\nThis is all conjecture, btw. But anyone with an economics degree will likely agree.",

Those people would then refinance their house to get a new teaser rate to keep it going. However, once their home values were no longer rising, they couldn't refinance and thus started defaulting. On top of this, banks were giving out mortgages that they knew were doomed to default because they could turn around and sell them to wall street investors, so they were clear of the downside of these bad mortgages. The reasoning for wall st investors buying them is where it starts getting more complicated so I'll leave it there.",

Instead, the programs became permanently attached to the land and all of the land receiving those subsidies ended up in the portfolios of the super wealthy.

Upon expiration there should be a vote by the people to continue or expire the program. But the people haven't proven themselves to be all that responsible, educated, or concerned either, so idk how feasible or productive that idea is either. Basically what I'm saying is that we still need social assistance programs, but there should be checks and balances to ensure they're actually serving their intended purpose.",

Plus they get to jump the line for liens, so they're still willing to lend even if it pushes the previously senior lienholder down the list.\n\nAs a result, FHLB lending is now seen as a distress signal for financial institutions, especially after Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and a few others had borrowed a bunch from FHLB before their collapses.\n\nThis article is about the mismatched incentives and oversight. They're federally created, and carry some implicit government guarantee, but they can pay big bonuses to their executives, which is unlike any government agency itself. It raises questions about whether the incentive structure causes unnecessary risks being borne by the taxpayer, both in the system and in the FHLBs themselves.",

They are the primary lender in the CU space, at mine we took a just in case borrowing late last year and it ended up being basically revenue neutral with the dividend they give on the required stock and the current overnight rate being about equal. For CUs that are in trouble (high risk rating from NCUA on capital stress tests) they start taking custody of the collateral, raise the rate, increase the haircut, and require weekly check-ins. There is a limit of who they will lend to but there\u2019s a chance an FI that was imploding could take out a loan before they get examined and downgraded.",

If you've bought recently you'll be fine, you may just have to wait 10 years or so to get your initial value back (judging from history).\n\nOf course that only applies if it's your primary residence. If you bought it as a rental or investment property...lol.\n\nI should also include that it is heavily location dependent. NE and Midwest people will probably be okay, you may get your values back much quicker. Can't say the same for some of the mountain states and southwest (Austin, Boise, etc.)",

However, it has come under scrutiny due to its increasing role in backstopping banks involved in various risky activities, rather than funding new mortgages. Troubled regional banks, including those serving cryptocurrency ventures and tech startups, have leaned on FHLBs for liquidity. Critics argue that the FHLB system enjoys significant government support without sufficient scrutiny or accountability. The system's loans are made quickly with little due diligence, generating billions in profits for FHLBs and banks but raising concerns about risk. Major banks like Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup have also relied on FHLBs for funding despite reducing their mortgage lending operations. While defenders emphasize the FHLB system's ability to provide liquidity in times of crisis, others argue that the system's role overlaps with that of the Federal Reserve and that it should focus more on supporting housing affordability, as mandated. The Federal Housing Finance Agency is conducting a review of the FHLB system to consider potential reforms.",

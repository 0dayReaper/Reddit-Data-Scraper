This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.* \n\nWow, what a week.  All I'll say on that for now.  I'll maybe do a recap of Friday at some point this weekend if I can.\n\nFor this post, rather than a narrative recap, I'll go into some very light technical analysis on a couple of screenshots from TD Ameritrade Thinkorswim and Ortex.  I don't have a lot of time to go very deep into everything I normally do, but I wanted to give the newer traders an example of how I go about coming to some of my conclusions.\n\nSome of the conclusions I came to in the heat of the moment in my previous posts may also not stand up to more rigorous scrutiny of the data.  In my opinion, at least, it's very important to ensure that you go back and review any of your high conviction trades from time to time.  Please feel free to use the charts I'll show to challenge some of the assumptions I may have made and written about while watching the live ticker tape action, social media, and other high-frequency sentiment indicators (things I might rely on for a hyper-realtime momentum monster trade like GME has been this past week).  Maybe use them to challenge your own thoughts and assumptions as well.\n\nI realized while doing this that writing those prior articles probably cost me \\~$300k in momentum trade opportunity LOL, since I used all of my free non-trading hour time to write instead of do an even more in-depth version of what I'm going to show you now.  That being said, if that writing helped any of you understand what was going on, and ultimately progress on your way to becoming better traders and investors, that to me is well worth it--maybe one day you too can pay it forward!\n\nIf any of you reading this are chart jockeys, please share some tips if you have them.\n\nFirst, the charts (links since pics aren't allowed on this sub)\n\n1. [Ortex Short Interest Data](https://u.teknik.io/oSTxt.png)\n2. [Daily Summary of the Week](https://u.teknik.io/7lF58.PNG)\n3. [1/26/2021 Mini Squeeze Hourly](https://u.teknik.io/QHqt2.PNG)\n4. [1/28/2021 to 1/29/2021 Fibonacci Retracement](https://u.teknik.io/VoiPc.PNG)\n\n# Fundamentals - Ortex Short Interest\n\nFirst, lots of questions on the prior post about Short Interest remaining on GME so I'll start with this one.  Looks good to me.  I think Ortex will update end of trading Friday data just before/around Monday market open.  I consider this chart to convey mostly fundamental data, as the underlying value thesis behind the recent push by retail traders has at least recently been about the squeeze.  This is the type of data you'd use to try to analyze data about the security being traded.  Note that most pro traders would not consider short interest to be a 'fundamental ' attribute, and normally I'd agree, but I think GME and maybe some of the other high SI plays are an exception to that.\n\nIf any of you are inclined to feel jumpy about the diving lines on the chart, make sure to look at the axis values on the left.  The chart is calibrated to capture the movement over the period, so the bottom of the axes are not 0.\n\nA few things to note:\n\n1. Short interest drops substantially from 1/26 into 1/27\n2. Volume is shrinking\n3. Remaining free float on loan has gone down, but at 66% as of Thursday, is still quite high\n\n# Overview - Daily Chart &amp; Summary of the Week\n\nA few things going on here\n\n1. The big volume days on Friday, Monday, and Tuesday are when it seems to me that the greatest retail momentum would have occurred.  The battles were pretty intense at key price points if you take a closer look at those intra-day charts.\n2. Big picture here, what it tells me is that many if not most of the retail share volume was acquired at or below $148 on huge volume.  That means the core of your retail support, and the majority of shares in WSB diamond hands would have been bought probably between the $30 and $148 price range.  My guess is that Only DFV the DFV early acolytes, Dr. Burry, and the institutional holders have meaningful volume below $30.\n3. Given points 1 and 2, I'd consider the $148 price level as the critical defense level of your earliest, hardest retail support.  You can dive deeper into the 1/26 trading day and possibly make a case for other levels as well, but I'll roll with that for now.\n4. Ok, so maybe the Melvin guys weren't really lying.  The Ortex data showing short interest drop from 1/26 to 1/27 coinciding with the massive and sudden price dislocation upward on 1/27.\n5. If new shorts entered the game it would have been near the highs, possibly selling into the forced buying of what I'll just assume was the overnight Melvin squeeze and into the early market  hours on 1/28.  Possibly aggressive momentum shorting on top of the Robin Hood BS, the bots, and the networking issues came together in a perfect storm with that HFT ladder attack on the vertical dive.  Wow--no wonder that thing was so intense.\n6. As you can see on that downside wick on 1/28, the huge momentum briefly pierced the Retail line before being slammed back up.  We'll take a closer look in the fibonacci chart.\n\n# Analysis - Mini Squeeze Hourly\n\nJust a few notes. I checked and the after hours volume here was sudden, quite unusual, and pretty consistent with a forced liquidation of a substantial position.  Rather than slamming it all out at once, the broker spread it out quite a bit.  Some takeaways:\n\n1. If you wanted to take money from Melvin, this was the chance, and a lot of people (or a few whales) certainly did.  The numbers in my summary were very quick mental math of the hourly volumes in overnight trading\n2. The price didn't break away as aggressively as it probably could have, which means there was some carefully calibrated pre-planning to unload a bunch of shares, laddering up to the $350 level.\n3. I am genuinely sorry to have to conclude, therefore, that the WSB bros with the $420.00 limit got scooped. Something on the order of 17 million shares worth of Melvin dollars got cashed out under them by a HFT whale with access to firehose shares at Melvin's broker all the way through overnight trading.  few retail even have the ability to trade for that entire window, and certainly not on the order of 17 million shares anyway.\n4. Another important takeaway: 17 million shares is a lot, but it's nowhere near the entire original SI in GME.  The Game hasn't necessarily Stopped yet (heh).\n\n# Technical Analysis - 1/28 to 1/29 Fibonacci Retracement\n\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar with what traders call \"technical analysis\", it's really just a fancy set of words to say looking at squiggly lines, bars, etc. on charts to try to figure out what's going on.\n\nOne particularly popular tool is called a fibonacci retracement.  It sounds a lot fancier than it is, but it is extremely useful, and extremely commonly used by momentum traders (which is partly why it's useful--if everyone is trading off of the same thing, it's a self-reinforcing bias in the market).  There is a lot of background reading you can do on the topic--I recommend it.  You'll be a better trader and even investor for it, as it tends to be useful even on longer timeframe charts.  Kind of uncanny really.\n\nLooking at this chart I realize I probably should have plotted the 'retail line of defense' here too.  Oh well, maybe next time.\n\nTakeaways:\n\n1. I figured the relevant trading range going forward was peak euphoria to peak despair in regular trading on relatively good volume.  That happened to be the top to bottom move on the Robin Hood news.\n2. Using that for the fibonacci retracement, you can see how much of the trading action bounces around between the various levels before settling in scarily accurately into the 50% - 61.8% channel in after hours trading.\n3. it's quite possible that short-term equilibrium on this battleground stock is $300 to $350 until either side makes a strong push.  Price was trapped in that range toward the end of normal trading on relatively good volume.\n4. Probably a bunch of momentum traders drew exactly this retracement (or something very similar) for their rest of day trading after the floor got put in near the retail line of defense.  In all honesty it's hard to say if the tool works because of some fundamental reason or because everyone uses it so everyone times their momentum plays off the same playbook, making it self-reinforcing.  All that matters in the end is that it works pretty consistently once you get used to working with it.\n5. Below the price graph, pay attention to the volume bars below.  It's especially critical when trading momentum to understand the relationship between share volume and price, as there are patterns that are more likely to play out depending on the relationship.  For example, when price is moving around a lot, is it doing so on high volume or not much volume?\n6. Traders tend to overshoot a little on each push, so even if price ultimately drops lower after an upside spike, if the volume on that drop is low compared to the upward push, that actually tells you that it's likely to go higher a little later on.  There are many sites that go more in depth into this kind of thing (patterns, volume and price analysis, etc.), and it is incredibly useful to try to understand what to take away from price and volume movement as you watch it unfold live.\n\nLots more going on here, but this post is getting pretty long already.\n\n# Other Takeaways\n\n* The whales in the pond obviously do their homework (that's how they got to be that big, after all), and they were therefore prepared to act decisively to unload 17 million shares at the upper end of the trading range when Melvin got blown up.  That's how you make big bank on big volume--do your homework.\n* My thesis in the [part 2 article](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l6xc8l/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_2/) that the big early drop before retail pre-market was a short-side scare tactic could very well be totally wrong.  You could make a case either way that it was a new short-side player diving in at a higher price point, a  long-side whale making bank, or a combo of both.  if you check the Ortex data against the numbers here you can probably come up with an order of magnitude educated estimate.  If so, apologies to the CNBC Squawk Box crew--probably no factual inaccuracies in your reporting (though the tone did make a lot of retail panic)\n* Ironically, it might very well have been the continued unwinding of Melvin's short position that intercepted the panic drop into premarket rather than a long-side heavy hitter.  LOL.\n* Thursday afternoon and Friday were low volume, low-conviction momentum sloshing around.  Dueling HFT algos and momentum traders trying to scalp alpha from each other is my guess.\n* Contract expiration may cause a price dislocation into the new trading week, so I'm not sure the fibonacci retracement chart is still useful.\n* I'm sure if I go back over my previous articles and compare to the chart data more carefully I'll find all kinds of other inconsistencies with my realtime thoughts.  It's key when trading, at least in my opinion, that you are willing, able, and indeed eager to go back and rethink your assumptions, no matter how much you liked them. Challenge and verify with data whenever possible.  Not doing that is how Melvin got blown up, after all.\n* My worst case scenario thesis in the [part 3 article](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/) may still be valid depending on the total amount of short interest loading up into GME at these newer highs.  I remember hearing some fund manager talking about shorting GME at the $400 as a stabilization mechanism.  Wow.. short something with the most hyper volatility of any $1bn+ stock I've ever heard of... for stability.  That's not a word I'd ever associate with a WSB meme momentum rollercoaster stock.\n* An infinity squeeze is still totally on the table, as long as sufficient short interest remains.  The strategy and tactics you'd use to get there may have to be different though, as price ratchets up into higher bands. I'll keep those thoughts to myself--for sure those WSB guys have a plan.  They've proven to be scary effective so far after all.\n\nThere are other things you can take away, or theses you can come up with from these and other charts you may have access to.  Hopefully, for you newer traders I've given you a useful glimpse into how I might try to use readily available data to improve/challenge/refine a working thesis to ensure I'm better prepared for the days ahead.  You should find the tools that seem to work best for you.\n\nHope you all have a good weekend.  See you on the field on Monday.",

This is not financial advice.\n\nEdit: I see the Director of Predictive Analytics from S3 says 113%. He states it as fact, but doesn\u2019t say whether this is some insider data that S3 has, or whether it\u2019s a result of their predictive modeling. However, he is the director of Predictive Analytics. I\u2019m not 100% sure, but I think this is still an estimate. I don\u2019t know how their financial models work and if their accuracy is tainted by the current volatility. I\u2019ll say, prior to the volatility, Ortex model was within 5% of the real number almost every time. However, the most recent report, using data from 1/15, was off by 16%. So their model is definitely affected, no one knows how much. \n\nIf we take their 113% and use 16% as the tolerance (which is one data point, so who knows if that\u2019s a good idea...) then we\u2019re between 97% short or 129% short.",

There's been plenty of Volume for any old shorts to have closed their position in the last two weeks. New shorts will come out on top and are way less likely to sell until this settles back below $100. Even with the large interest on new shorts right now. \n\nIf most new shorts are in above $300 then the short interest doesn't matter much. The price would have to keep getting artificially inflated to create pressure on them to sell all at once.\n\nI think all these new shorts will just prolong gme staying above $100. But it's not exactly a recipe for a squeeze. \n\nThis is obviously opinion. I would love to hear a counter argument.",

But, the math on available shares is still the math, and if GME opens at an ATH on Monday then those shorts are, for the time being, underwater, and additionally paying the highest rates. If it can open high on Monday and if the % actually available float drops due to retail holding then I think the squeeze is still unsquozed.",

ShortB\u2019s shorts are synthetic. Also 3 people each own two games for a total of 6 games. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a naked short because they have borrowed games owned by Annie. Never mind that they were borrowed from me. Nobody keeps track of that. As long as there is liquidity and continuous unwinding and winding of positions then it\u2019s all hunky dory. \n\nBut what if people stop selling? What if they pressure the shorts? \n\nMaybe they\u2019ll find enough sellers at a reasonable price to unwind the synthetics. \n\nBut who have synthetic shorts and who don\u2019t? Maybe there is not enough sellers at a price below bankruptcy. Maybe there\u2019s a flaw in the system nobody has thought of? The system could break, something unpredictable could happen. Everyone on the street fears the unpredictable more than anything.\n\nEdit: I believe this is how the money supply grows through loans.\n\nEdit: the shorts aren\u2019t synthetic.

Be it from another Hedge Fund, Cyberattack or reddit these folks must have had an exit plan or cut some deals to prevent it.   \n\n\nThey've been playing the game far longer. It's hard to predict just what all they are doing/can do but I also thought that perhaps the pressure on the interest or payment isn't that big of deal for them. Or as you said maybe they would just rather slowly bleed to death with the chance this whole spontaneous retail investor banding together thing dies out and they turn a massive profit again.     \n\n\nThe whole concept of the dirty tactics they are doing isn't BS or conspiracy theory though.

The Melvins are on the open while the long side whales are on the dark. If a billionaire sees opportunity to eat other billionaire, they will jump at that opportunity every time. Also, since most stock volume is frozen by insiders and retailers, the chance of short side winning on long run is relatively low. Just my opinion. Not a financial advisor.",

Every ladder attack volume has been low. 200 shares sold 100 bought. I think the whale on our side has been dipping there toes in each time snapping up shares.\n\nPuts expired worthless. Another huge loss.\nHigh interest rate bleeding them.\nThis is on top of what $60 billion losses so far.\n\nLong hedge fund shark is in the water and it smells blood.\nWe are just along for the ride.\nAnother thing to think about is the blatant in your face manipulation OUT IN THE DAYLIGHT with the worlds media paying attention.

I\u2019ve been tracking Melvin Capital\u2019s positions, both long and short, to get a general idea on what might be going on in the HF industry, especially amongst the titans. \n\nOne of the notable trends I\u2019ve noticed is defensive selling on the long side of the 13F holdings Melvin Capital released at the end of last year. Whenever GME starts spiking, short positions trade in-line (not nearly at the same volatility,) and longs get hammered. There\u2019s a balance as GME slows on momentum through the day, and then crazy price action in PM/AH.\n\nI had theorized that Melvin Capital may have capitulated (last week,) but that started seeming less likely (unless they jumped ship first to protect loss using the 2.7b capital infusion and now it\u2019s other shorts.) Their short positions outside GME, in particular, are starting to indicate a return to being value throttled. CHD made earnings with a beat, both in EPS and revenue (surpassing last year\u2019s revenue,) but still got forced into a down channel at close of day Friday (after a solid earnings and a generally positive sentiment.) \n\nMeanwhile, longs found support towards end of day (while being down overall for the month.) Melvin\u2019s biggest long option position by cost is FISV, and LB by shares. Both have been getting beat down, but prices appear to consolidate up whenever GME (and others,) shows downward momentum. \n\nThis is all amplified due to copy cat HFs, inverse HFs, whales, retail, sentiment, and SI that has not decreased appreciably (even if the needle has moved on short entry.) If I was an HF, I wouldn\u2019t touch this thing with OPM. It\u2019s turning into a movement, and retail investors are hitting something beyond euphoria. At the current rate, even if whales get out, GME is going to be associated with positive sentiment in the general public. Some media and groups like Citron Research are trying to poison the well, both to stop this crazy volatility and to prevent GME from establishing a permanent foothold above short target prices.\n\nThere is such a large inflow of data and variables, I would not be surprised if Melvin Capital bailed, but I don\u2019t know if they could actually close their whole position. Additionally, if they have tied their holdings together in either an algo model (for HFT,) or in the structure of their HF trading model, they may be \u201cstuck\u201d to a degree. I\u2019m still trying to figure out whether MC would be considered a type of Unified Managed Account, and if so, what sort of financial products could they have built out of their positions. They check the boxes: high buy-in, full discretion of funds, and what appears to be a single targeted strategy. Weirdly, they also only have 7 clients, and almost all capital comes from their companies based in the Cayman Islands (common master-feeder setup.) \n\nNo one knows these seven clients, but if the paperwork is anything to go by, they\u2019re actually institutions. \n\nAnyway, I haven\u2019t taken my adderall today, so idk, GME volatility will continue as scheduled and Melvin probably didn\u2019t fully escape their position yet.",

Ironically, this ends up trying to drive the price down which hurts everybody who has already invested (half of their users).\n\nI still hold to the Napolean (I think?) quote: Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.\n\nI suspect RH is a poorly run company and there was a lot of stupidity involved in the decisions being made. The damage will be done either way.\n\nThat said, I am totally willing to believe that it was a move geared towards protecting Citadel and I also still believe that the infinity squeeze is still on the table. If it does, I am going to be able to retire, so it's hard to force myself to try to read perspectives on both sides because my desire for confirmation bias is incredibly strong right now.",

                                    "comment": "As a preface, this is just my opinion. Do whatever you feel is right with your money. I can\u2019t know what is happening real time and am just piecing together info that a lot of others could probably more eloquently explain and have posted. My particular \u201cexpertise\u201d is more on the valuation and macroeconomic side of investing than the market mechanics side, which is what is happening right now. \n\nI think the squeeze is still in motion, and is currently delayed. I am subscribed to the theory that Thursday was about to trigger an absolutely unfathomable gamma squeeze and short squeeze on top of it. For some reason MM\u2019s are still being allowed to write options on this incredibly volatile and now somewhat political stock. On Thursday, that stock opened with at $500 a share and had enough raging buying power to push it $550 despite multiple short attacks putting downward pressure on it. This was going to put the $570 calls that were just made almost instantly into the money and trigger while hedging to go with all the other poorly issued call options already in the money. We then had the shutdowns by the brokerages everyone has talked about, and I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not 1000% educated on that side of the business. My very basic understanding is that it was likely because the clear houses did not have enough liquidity to cover the fact that an universe-ripping squeeze was gonna take place with a starting price near $600 (we\u2019ve never had a stock begin a squeeze that high). \n\nSooo with that background of the situation laid out, time to address my comment on the availability of shares. The various brokerages all own some amount of the float of the stock with the clear houses sort of provided the liquidity to execute the trades. Some of these brokerages like TD (or Fidelity) had upwards of 20% float so they were able to facilitate trading of shares more than a Robinhood who can\u2019t go and find the shares out there when they\u2019re trading hundreds of dollars. We need to remember this was a micro cap company a couple weeks ago that suddenly traded more than the S&amp;P 500 itself for two days. So what happens when the float is decreasing because of failed short attacks and buying pressure is keeping an ever increasing price floor on the stock, oh and by the way, 10-25% of the buying pressure isn\u2019t even re-entering the float because those people hate wall st and view this as a movement and want to hold. Eventually, the shorts are out of the margin or paying interest payments so high for their new shorts that their collateral with the brokerage is deteriorating and should be margin called. Well even if your short interest has come down some, all it\u2019s down is help prop up this buy floor. Now you need to cover your shorts which will cause a never ending price increase (aka the MOASS), oh and you\u2019ve got to cover it with this float that the MM\u2019s are also competing to cover with to hedge against their poorly underwritten options. This means everyone now needs to buy this limited float over and over, so the real short pressure isn\u2019t this 120%, it\u2019s more like 600-1200% (ranges I\u2019ve seen from people smarter than me). \n\nNow with all that said, this short squeeze becomes less and less likely to happen if you don\u2019t let anyone touch the stock because eventually people will lose interest due to opportunity cost increasing. If you\u2019re a richer than god hedge fund, who cares you\u2019re not gonna lose hundreds of billions on the trade now. There\u2019s also been so much levels of illegal activity here that anything is possible. Wouldn\u2019t even surprise me if the brokerages start doing force liquidations with loan money (market cap is only $15B rn) for \u201cthe market\u2019s protection\u201d because what do you even do about that in court? The loss potential was infinite, you can\u2019t measure it, but you also can\u2019t know for certain what\u2019d it be. So what do you do? Probably fine them less than they would\u2019ve lost and they win.\n\nI\u2019m on mobile so sorry if some of it is quickly explained.\n\nTLDR: I\u2019m holding but more for symbolic movement reasons. Do what you feel is right with your money. Brokerages &amp; clear houses have liquidity issues, I\u2019m seeing degrossing across the market, no one is allowed to buy so really on interest payments are pressuring the shorters right now and if that stays it could take forever for them to run out of money and at that point everyone may just be praying on a govt bailout per usual.",

What does that mean?  It means it might turn into a situation where you have rolling crushes and squeezes for a long time.  Icahn vs Ackman ran for something like 4-5 years lol.  There are scenarios where you can end up ringing the register on this thing at hedge fund managers' expense over and over and over.  If Ryan Cohen actually has a good turnaround strategy going in the background, GME could also take advantage of that kind of action to shore up the balance sheet and fund an accelerated turnaround to the point where even a fundamental valuation would peg it as a $200+ stock.  That is the max bullish case scenario I can think of (no idea how likely as we haven't heard anything from GME's board or management that definitively tells us they have a good strategy).",

I get this strategy (the idea make sense, but its not working as people wont sell)\n\nNow the other strategy I heard is something between the lines like this:\n\n* Cover their shorts and immediately get into another short position? (this one doesnt make sense because they would be required to have the same amount of capital/assets as leverage)\n* Double down on shorts (I am assuming this is the DCA strategy, but this would burn through their leverage really quick and make the short squeeze happen even earlier because they will need more leverage to keep old and new shorts)\n\nCan someone please enlighten me?",

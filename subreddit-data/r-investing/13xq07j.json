They also all take different approaches on how to pick the funds. So you now have 3 indexes that try to pick index paying stocks based on a criteria (and all three are different) so you do not have to be a good stock picker\n\nThe dividend advocates are really just stock picking advocates they think they can pick 10-15 stocks that will outperform the market, if they can great good for you. \n\nI am just saying the average person really sucks are picking stocks and if you asked 100 people to go out and pick 10 stocks, most would lag the market long term.",

It also offers what passive indexing cannot: a stable income and/or growth stream, and wealth preservation. The last is a key point for many retirees, and is based on the fact that unlike selling shares for income, a dividend investor never needs to sell shares at any particular time. These are facts beyond dispute, but unpopular with those who have been misled.",

You're welcome to mislead as you like, but I won't be responding.\n\nNothing I've presented here, or in our other discussions, is misleading.\n\nI'm genuinely trying to have discussions with you in good faith, but all you do is make assertions without offering anything concrete to demonstrate why focusing on yield over total return leads to better long-term outcomes.\n\nThe only evidence I've ever seen you present is [back-tested comparisons of cherrypicked stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/13vfw3y/comment/jm72ffk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that outperformed the market, but that's not actually evidence of anything. I could show you ***thousands*** of dividend stocks that underperformed the market, but I'm guessing you wouldn't accept this as evidence against your claims.\n\nSuggesting that you can outperform the market by investing in stocks that beat the market is kind of obvious. But you'll only know whether something beats the market looking backwards, and there is no way to know in advance which stocks will outperform. If you really knew which stocks are going to outperform the market you'd be a billionaire on a yacht and you wouldn't be having this discussion on reddit.\n\nIf dividend stocks were inherently better as you're suggesting, then everyone would know that and the market would price them such that the advantage would be lost. Stock returns are based on expectations, so the only way for dividend stocks to consistently outperform expectations is if the market consistently underestimates them. But this does not happen in theory, or in practice, as the market is generally efficient and responds to all available information.",

When I buy dividend stocks I always set them to re-invest the dividends.  I'll be in accumulation mode for decades.  I'll take money out when I retire, I don't want it now.",

            "comment": "Dividends and \nWhy you should not focus on them:\n\nDividends and the growth of dividends are explained by the FF Five Factor Model. And explained extremely well\n\nDividend focused investors generally OVERPAY for dividend yield (impact on expected return)\n\nDividend focused investors are highly sensitive to dividend distribution (you are letting corp governance dictate your spending!)\n\nYou could take a typical dividend focused portfolio - and recreate it with better tax efficiency and more diversification by ignoring dividends. \n\nSee: https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.12785\n\nSee: https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.12968\n\nDividends do NOT explain future expected returns (these are explained from priced risk exposure)\nDividends cut out roughly 53% of ALL global stocks - reducing diversification and reducing the reliability of your investment outcome\n\nFavouring dividend-paying growth stocks tends to tilt a portfolio toward large-cap value stocks ,companies that exhibit robust profitability and conservative investing. So, picking dividend stocks is probably better than picking stocks in general.  But you still take on enormous amounts of idiosyncratic risk by picking individual equities.\n\nTo those who love Buffet - see this https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2012ltr.pdf page 19 - where he illustrates how he does NOT use dividends as criteria for picking his securities. \nMore so - he likes low priced value companies.\n\nTLDR, focus on total return. \n\nA good starting point is a low cost, globally diversified index fund.",

Citron needs to investigated for possible collusion with firms for market manipulation. They did the same damn thing with PLTR. They find stocks with momentum and then send out a hit piece just so they can get a better price to buy in. Smh",

There is a less need for an intermediary like GameStop to sell games.\n\nMeanwhile, BB and PLTR actually are building products that are needed for the foreseeable future (security + bigdata).",

Cohen may pull a rabbit out of the hat on $GME, (he might be better positioned to do this than anyone, frankly) but it\u2019s speculation and a MASSIVE short squeeze driving this run right now. \n\n$BB is badly undervalued against its tech peers. Do your own DD, but this new BlackBerry under Chen is a phoenix from the ashes of an old hardware giant. Watch this space.",

That is the point of value stocks. They have problems and that's why they're not trading at the appropriate value.\n\nYes there is speculation, but I'm an avid gamer and I think there's a lot of potential.

As the price rises, they (and share shorters as well) need to buy shares to cover the risk of having to deliver shares at a low price (also see gamma exposure). This becomes particularly urgent when the call options reach their expiry date (Fridays). Then there's the effect of margin calls if share/option shorters have used leverage to short - a price rise could force them to liquidate their shorts, i.e. buy shares. All taken together, the price rise becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy - a short squeeze.",

If the price goes up, you end up losing a lot of money. This means shorters head for the exit and price continues to sky.\n\nThese guys shorted more shares than were even in existence!\n\nLook up 2008 VW short squeeze, [KBIO short squeeze](https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/). Fascinating case studies on an economic phenomenon where Supply becomes not existent, increasing Demand through the roof. I've learned more in the last week of trading than in my previous 2 years, it is so interesting.",

It sounds like you were buying tesla just for the volatility of the stock so you could make quick money and repeat. If you believed in the company you would not be quick swing trading it. \n\nI literally did the same thing with tesla and sold at 300 something last year after I was comfortable with the money I made. In hindsight obviously I wish I saw tesla for what the market sees but I did exactly what my original goal was.\n\nI still have shares in companies from that time that I have only held and never sold my position on because those are the companies I trust.\n\nIf you interpret every volatile upwards spike as news that you shouldn't sell you will get shit on eventually.",

It's not like it happens the same day every 4 years and it's not like this wasn't covered extensively, even more than previous inaugurations.\n2. The next day he tries again. He can't get it going. Tweets about \"technical issues.\" Then he claims he's being *hacked*. Come on, man. No one's hacking your goddamn Twitter. \n3. Eventually he just records and uploads the video. Most of it is dishonest or incorrect.\n\nIt was a shitshow from the start. I was a little worried at first because I've seen his stuff before and usually it makes a few good points. His GME one was garbage and clearly other people agreed. Share price didn't even blink. If anything, the complete lack of a solid bear case intensified the bull case.",

Not only has the number of shares available to short decreased, but the rate at which you have to pay was raised from 45% (after sitting at 20% for weeks) to 100%!!!!\n\nI've seen some DD claiming a gamma squeeze which looks most likely to me for the halted trading run up. There were almost 15,000, $40 puts that expired yesterday. I was watching the price of those Puts, and on Thursday they were trading at like $2.3 a pop, but by Friday morning, even though the stock was green on a red day, the puts had barely moved in price. THATS CUZ NOBODY WAS DUMB ENOUGH TO BUY THEM!!! As the stock slowly crept up and long buying countered any other available short positions, the puts were moving super low volume. At the point of the gamma squeeze, the puts simply went to worthless, they weren't gonna print and the shares had to be returned.\n\nExpiring puts = rocket fuel",

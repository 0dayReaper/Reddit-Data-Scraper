What country do you live in?  \n* Are you employed/making income? How much?  \n* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)  \n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  \n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  \n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)  \n* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?  \n* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.  \n\nPlease consider consulting our FAQ first - https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/faq\nAnd our [side bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/about/sidebar) also has useful resources.  \n\nIf you are new to investing - please refer to Wiki - [Getting Started](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/gettingstarted/)\n\nThe reading list in the wiki has a list of books ranging from light reading to advanced topics depending on your knowledge level.

I am the custodian.  \nHe is on the verge of dropping out of school, is starting to get into drugs, has moved out of our home, and is aware of the account, just not the amount. To insulate him from accessing it, we are considering withdrawing the money and making a large purchase (like a condo) and putting it in his name. We would rent it out and put that income towards a saving account for our son. Any thoughts/info on the legality of such a withdraw, or other ideas on investments we could make for her so that she doesn't have access until stable would be immensely appreciated. Also, any creative solutions on how to have assets in his name which we wouldn't need him to sign for? PS we're in MN. Thanks, Reddit!",

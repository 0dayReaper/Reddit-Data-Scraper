    "postText": "Hey everyone! Just recently started working for a company and am setting up my Roth IRA, but was confused on the wording. It says:\n\n\u201cFor every dollar you contribute up to 1% of your salary, Company will add one dollar to your account per pay period. For every dollar you contribute on the next 5% of your salary, Company will add 50 cents to your account per pay period.\n\nCompany makes a Retirement Contribution that is equal to 4.5% of your pay per pay period for anvone with less than 10 Years of service or 6.5% of your pay per pay period for anyone with 10 or more years of service. You are eligible to receive this contribution immediately.\u201d\n\nCan someone Barney style this for me? It says they will match 6% (5% of which will be 50 cents to the dollar) but then the bottom says 4.5%. \n\nI am attempting to match so I get maximum payout by the company, while also paying off my student loans. Then I will adjust more towards that 20% mark. Appreciate the help!",

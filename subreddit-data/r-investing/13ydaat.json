    "postText": "There's a lot of diversity in ESPPs.  Some have a limited lookback provision, some have mandatory minimum holding periods.  The discounts may not be very high.  However, there are plenty that seem like a no-brainer, for instance 15% discount with a full lookback provision and no minimum holding period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat would be the least ideal ESPP that would be considered worth doing if one wants to avoid investing in a single stock (and one's employer's stock at that) but also not pass up \"free money\"?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor my employer, we get a 10% discount on the closing price at the lower of the beginning or end of the 3 month offering period (that's good), but we have to hold for another 15 months after the holding period (definitely not good).  What would be the longest holding period you would consider investing in a similar ESPP?  For reference it's a Fortune 500 company, but this is for generic ESPPs and participating only for the discount, not because one is betting on one's employer.",

            "comment": "It depends, is your company stock one you want to hold and are already buying?\n\nI wouldn't accept any holding period at my current company. My ESPP is valuable to me because it's guaranteed gains. \n\nI get a 15% discount to the lowest price of the first or last date, and I sell the very same day the shares settle.\n\nBut that's because if I had cash right now I would not buy my company stock, I see better deals in the market I want to own. If I was working at a company who's stock I wanted to actively buy I would accept a ~12 month holding period.\n\nTo make it simpler, If you had cash right now would you buy your company stock? If yes, than a holding period is acceptable. If no, then a holding period is unacceptable when you could be using that cash to buy stocks you actually want to own.",

This doesnt mean if you had x amount in cash would you literally buy the stock. In simple terms is the value of the companies financials and market position such that you would hold your company stock. If you worked for a market leading company that is doing well, there is no harm in holding some. If your entire NW is tied up in your company thats one thing. Outside of that, only you can decide on the right number.",

The benefit of going to 24 months is the taxable discount (taxed as income) is on the FMV at the beginning of the offering period.\n\nWhen all is said and done, looking back at historical share prices for my employer, the tax benefits of holding 24 months rather than the required 18 months is a return on only around 6-7%, which is not really worth it for an individual stock.",

Espp looks at the first and last day of the period and gives you the lower off the price. If the stock goes up you get the 15% discount (what I get) plus all the gains. If it goes down you still get the 15% discount. So it's an automatic 15% discount even if the stock price is at a lower price. \n\n\nIf your company has a lot of upside it's 100% worth it. I joined my company 2 years ago and since I'm a bit of a vet in my industry I know that the company I was joining was at relative to the competition and I concluded that it's about to go off. We got lucky and got hit with the bear market and plus a bad regulatory decision that got us a favorable strike price for 2 years straight.\n\nIf you don't have confidence in your company, you could sell right away and lock in the 15% discount. I got confidence in mine and been riding the lower cost basis now and up nearly 100%\n\nYmmv",

You have some type (even lightly maybe) of direct insider knowledge of your company.\n\nYou're living and breathing it every day. You know the culture. You know leadership and hopefully listen to the internal all hands calls and public quarterly conference calls. You see if and how they are hiring and growing or if they are struggling and lay offs coming. You might work in finance and see the revenues and money flow. You might work in sales and see the upcoming pipeline. You might work in system/software development and know some upcoming projects are a game changer for an industry or company. You might work in marketing and see the budgets getting bigger and expanding as presence. Etc etc.\n\nCombine all of that and make a determination or rank your confidence. Even if there isn't a look back, full 15% discount, or there is a holding period...it doesn't mean it might not be a fairly competitive part of your financial planning and maximizing returns on your hard earned capital.\n\nAlso, I would factor dividends into the holding period and ROI. A 10% discount and a 5% dividend would give a minor bump to the ROI and dividends might also make a difference in a holding period vs a growth company that isn't granting any dividend.",

Espp price is 85 for 2 years and you get the stock every 6 months and can sell immediately. If the stock goes below 100 at any 6 month stock buy date, the stock price is dropped to that price and the 2 year window starts from there.  \n\nSecond company (that had espp) you could buy stock with every Paycheck and got it then at the price on the check date and you would get the stock on that date (but don\u2019t pay a commission)..  \n\nFirst company the stock was pretty amazing, so in the situation above, it would go from 100 to 200 by the end of the  2 years (or higher) and you\u2019d be buying the last shares at 85 for a stock that was priced at 200.",

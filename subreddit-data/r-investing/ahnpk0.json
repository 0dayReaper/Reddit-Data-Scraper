If the youth use continues to rise, and we see  significant increases in use in 2019, on top of the dramatic rise in  2018, the entire category will face an existential threat,\" [he said.](https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Speeches/ucm629620.htm)\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Possibility they combine the two products down the road when more formal  legalization hits the US or make a new product based on the Juul patents/tech.  Zero chance MO didn't see headwinds coming on this issue before this purchase of Juul and they still went ahead with it.  The story of big tobacco (or rather any big industry) trying to create lifelong customers early on is not new here.  Not trying to dissuade you from shorting MO (in 2018 that would be have a very profitable short and I don't have a position either way).  \n\nAs a sidenote if you short shares in companies with a \"x timeframe\" dividend (MO is quarterly), just know you'll have to pay the dividend doing that period if you short during ex dividend.",

Make a product people want and they will buy it.  Maybe cigarettes aren\u2019t the way of the future.  So instead of trying to make it the only product available, why don\u2019t you try to beat the e cig companies at their own game.  It\u2019s not like big tobacco doesn\u2019t have enough money for research and development of something people would want.  They have way more resources than most vape companies had when they started out.  Idk.. I was able to quit smoking with a vape.  I still vape but I don\u2019t crave it like I did cigarettes.  When I wake up in the morning it\u2019s not the first thing I do.  When I smoked I had to have one when I woke up.  So I\u2019m pretty sure if I had to stop it wouldn\u2019t be that bad.  Hell my ex\u2019s mom quit smoking with those blu e cigs and she loved them.  She had gallon zip lock bags of the little menthol carts.  It was crazy and crazy expensive.  But it worked and I think she quit those as well. ",

Part of this is because it used to be more common and we tend to associate old social trends with class (see also: three piece suits). As a side effect or a cause, smoking cigars is done as a sign of spending these days (see probably any mid-00s rap video where they're wearing suits).\n\nAlso, cigars have tended towards more expensive as time has gone on.

There were several other competitors that undercut Juul on pricing, higher nicotine concentration and larger variety of flavors. And that users can also purchase 3rd party refillable pods instead of Juul's pods.\n\nThe shop owner said they stocked a competitor's products one day, and all of that inventory sold out while Juul was struggling to sell. The other e-cig shop owners they know had similar experiences.\n\nSomeone summarized their analysis as \"So you're telling me Juul is the Keurig of e-cigs?\"\n\nEDIT: Here's the big thread, posted just 12 days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/adiieq/a_somewhat_long_writeup_on_the_juul_for_those/",

Not, banning it and leaving the distribution of the product to uninterested cashiers at your local Wal-Mart or sketchy website distributor. ",

But this stands out:\n\n&gt;I find myself debating with tobacco makers and retailers the merits of selling fruity flavors in ways that remain easily accessible to kids. But if the epidemic continues to mount, I\u2019m sure that the debate will change to one of whether these products should continue to be marketed at all without authorized pre-market tobacco applications. It could be \u201cgame over\u201d for some these products until they can successfully traverse the regulatory process. I think the stakes are that high. And would be a blow for all of the currently addicted adult smokers who, I believe, could potentially benefit from these products.\n\nThey are talking about taking flavors completely off the market, which is more than they have seriously discussed before.

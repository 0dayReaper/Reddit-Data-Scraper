    "postText": "\n[ Bot hates me so here is a link](http://www.bloomberg.com/news)\n\nIn the late 90's we had a similar Tech/Digital stock rally (this is not nearly as bad though, so chill, companies are actually destroying the estimates and profits are strong).\n\nBack then it was web page development and internet providers, now it's mainly electric vehicles and some parts of tech. \n\n\u201cSt0nks\u201d were only going up, up and up. You heard things like - Dude, its a new economy, this is the new normal. This is the future, you can't use old models to define value. Die all boomers and burn traditional stocks (ok I might be exaggerating on this one). \n\nAnyway, I was a finance major at a prominent university in London, UK. I was destined for greatness and a trainee spot at Deutsche Bank's analyst desk. My friend - let's call him Eli, because his name was actually Eli - was a stock genius. \n\nEverybody is a genious in a bull market, you put some money in to a company in IT and BAM, the new Buffett (or Cathie).\n\nEli was good for about 350kUSD at one point, not bad for a student. Or I should say, 350kUSD nominal value in stocks. Because, its not money until you sell. Eli learned the hard way.\n\nThe \"dip\" came. Eli figured \"st0nks only go up\" - I'm gonna \"buy the dip\". The dip became a slide, then a vortex and finally evolving in to a capital sucking black hole (not an anus ok).\n\nEli bought and bought, he also had a debt position of about 25% of his portfolio. This increased to 50%. The bank called, Hey Eli - that collateral isn't so hot anymore, pay up dude. Eli paid up. One year later he had -13kUSD on his account for accrued interest rates and trading fees.\n\n\n\nSo what's there to learn. Well, depends on how risk averse you are, but I see a lot of new investors that ask about when and how to take home profits. There is no rule or best practice, but here's at least an strategy that I'm using myself.\n\n\n1. I  usually don't let a stock grow beyond 20% of my portolio, if it does I start scaling back profits and weight to other, new opportunities. The riskier the stock the earlier and more I scale back.\n\nCompound that interest, bitch.\n\n2. I always keep a 10-15% cash position so I can take advantage on dips or other opportunities. This capital has had a ridiculous payback over the years. This is not money, this is capital. I have a savings account with 3 months salary. That\u2019s money. Money pays bills, capital grows.\n\n3. For every 20% growth I take home for example 20% of the profit in riskier playa. So in G-ME for example I started buying early and by $90 I only had profits invested. By 300 I had sold about 2/3 and on the way down I dropped the last stocks at 115. \n\nSo let\u2019s say a stock grows from 100 to 120. I take back 4. Then it goes to 140, I take back another 8 so now I have taken 12 total. \n\nObviously there is some flexibility here, but use it for inspiration. For more secure stocks you want to hold on more and longer, but for me it\u2019s a lot about maintaining that cash position.\n\n\nSo what do I do with my profits? Well, I do a few things. \n\n\n1. I reinvest them in to other stocks, so I make sure I have a short list of alternatives at all times.  For example, my G-ME winnings (yes it was a casino) paid for 300 PayPal stocks at $231. They\u2019re now up 15%. \n\nCompound that interest, bitch.\n\n\n2. I put them in the cash position so I can be opportunistic (but still max 15%). Life saver in March, pure rocket fuel baby. \n\n\n3. I buy my wife or kids presents, I get a nice Rolex or refurbish the house.  I turn it in to money. I have money so I can spend it, use it. \n\n\n\nMoral of the story or TLDR;\n\nMake money, you probably won't see another opportunity like the one of the past 6-10 months. Its not coming back for a while. \n\nDon't step out of the market, pick your stocks wisely, keep some cash to pounce on some disappointing earning calls or dips and remember: IT IS NOT MONEY UNTIL YOU SELL.\n\nDisclaimer 2: I was a licensed financial advisor as in a securities analyst, but do your own research. This is not advice, it\u2019s inspiration.\n\nPS Eli went on to be a very successful entrepreneur and has started a few companies. I believe one of them is going to IPO soon DS\n\nEdit: clarified advisor part\n\nEdit 2: this completely blew up, thanks for all the awards and upvotes but spend the money on stocks instead!",

Yeah, 20% is just fun money to throw around to see if you can really move the needle on an otherwise super safe portfolio.\n\nHowever, I live a rather frugal lifestyle compared to others so my threshold for \"casino money\" is likely a lot higher than most, as losing 20% of my net worth would have zero practical impact on my lifestyle or long term financial security.\n\nI think one thing OP gets right here that others miss is that he mentions he takes profits to spend on luxuries which is almost universally frowned upon in these communities.

Since then I have maxed 401k, stock purchasing for nearly 20 years and suddenly I'm looking at 7 figures in assets. \n\nNow I'm playing penny stocks doing my own DD and am holding 6 figures in gains so far (ALPP, ABML for those curious) and hopefully rising since they're both uplisting as we speak. I put 40k total in, but that was money I had pulled out as the market plummeted during early covid. The difference now is,  I've allocated it for growth. \n\nThank to both you and the OP for your posts. Good stuff!",

Otherwise let the profit run. You should scale up instead of down - if AMZN has grown very large on its own, put your new salary into other things to balance the ratio or invest in other industries, while still maintaining some cash on hand. \n\nThe ratio won't be stable like a fund doing this, but I find it working out way better. Winner has tend to win more a lot in recent times. Also, the trouble of tax events are not worth the \"potential\" extra 5% I can earn from pulling moves to me - which aren't even guaranteed between bad decisions and potential extra tax.  \n\nEverything I've hold so far is over 2-3 years long: \n\nTop performers include: TSLA, SHOP, SQ, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, Crypto, etc. \n\nMeh performers include: FB, GOOGL, DIS, TTWO, etc.\n\nShittiest performance is index SPY. \n\nIf I had scaled any back the way OP described as things popped off of a ER or special trigger, my performance would be significantly worse especially one before they have become capital gains. I've held TSLA since $50 (or $250 pre-split) without selling any until $694.20. \n\nMy newer holds (less than 1 year) are ETSY, LSPD, API, all of which boomed too but I ain't gonna scale shit back either. Why would I if I still believe in the business and the growth of it? \n\nThe only take away from this post is don't catch the falling knife with debt that you can't sustain. Keep cash on hand (which I have plenty) and hold through dips or crashes. Same things applies to the dot com bubble too.\n\nDisclaimer - as good as my portfolio above sounds and it is true that I practically haven't picked a single loser so far (which isn't hard to do in this tech bull run), I have lost plenty in yolo options world playing for fun before r/wsb became r/gme. You do not want to follow my options positions... inversing me is close to guaranteed money.\n\nEdit: [this comment has some visibility so I will link to my other comment \"shilling\" for API too](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldqxmv/how_do_you_discover_potential_stocks/gm89aov/) Absolutely not a financial adviser and please do your own DD, I'm not one of those people who will write a paper for you, but at least put it on your radar when you are busy hopping around in clubhouse if not now then in a few days or weeks guaranteed :)",

The Financial Times have written an excellent article on it:\n [Financial times](https://www.ft.com/content/9fbd8265-f94b-4e0a-a924-ba3e6365daca)\nIn addition to this hedge funds will always be able to execute orders before you do as there is a daily with transactions on retail sites such as RH and Trading 212. There were no short ladder attacks, it was simply traders cashing in. \n\nPut it all down to an expensive lesson and move on. I don't want you to feel like this is an attack, I also made a play on GME and lost cash, I bet emotionally and was drawn into the hype like you were.

They allow direct access to the markets, you can choose which exchange to trade on and which market maker you buy and sell to if you wish. You can algo trade just as fast as the big boys with the same market data they use. \n\nThe solutions are out there people need to get off robinhood which hopefully the the GME saga has made clear.",

Not investors, active traders. For most beginner and intermediate users Fidelity or Schwab are going to be easy to use, big enough to avoid market liquidity issues, and have the best learning resources and support.",

Those posts got shouted down.  \n\nThe GME followed the same pattern.   I wasn't in on it. My humble opinion is GME would have carried on a bit longer if it wasn't for RH slowing the trading and the weekend that followed the big spike.   I think people reflected and started selling off.  \n\nMy take is if reddit starts talking about something DD.   If it seems everyone is in and going crazy about how it's only going to go up, it's time to sell.  \n\nNot advice just my observations.",

In hindsight, those of us who held can see it was the wrong move (20/20 and such) Reality at the time was that something unprecedented was happening, and I chose to hold because we were in uncharted waters. A gamble of sorts.\n\nThe sign I regret not seeing the full implications of was when the platforms restricted Buys. At that point, the game was clearly tilted against any sort of increase in a pretty massive way. \n\nAnalogy that comes to mind is an underdog in the boxing ring... thrashing the champ, the crowd cheers. It seems close to being over, like the impossible might happen. Then the officials call a time out. They tell the challenger that he can no longer throw punches for the next couple of rounds. The champ wears down the challenger (who is relegated to doing nothing but trying to duck the champ's punches because he's prevented from throwing his own) Once the officials make that rule change, even if only for a couple of rounds, the outcome was inevitable.",

It didn\u2019t happen overnight, so I watched it day after day thinking \u201cit\u2019s Cisco, it\u2019ll come back!  I\u2019m sure others were buying even more shares \u201con the dip\u201d.  It\u2019s a famous example of a stock that didn\u2019t recover for 14 years. \n\nTwenty years later it still stings, kind of like a bad breakup. Hindsight, it\u2019s so clear I should have sold after it exploded. But euphoria and FOMO are powerful. It\u2019s human nature. \n\nBut I just kept at it, putting money in every month, year after year and while I never had another Cisco, I had Tesla and Shopify and others that did me well. \n\nLook forward, not back. You can still earn money and invest money and there\u2019s many growth sectors right now to invest in. It\u2019ll work out. \n\nBased on what I\u2019ve learned, had I been in your situation with GME I\u2019d have sold half.  If you totally jump ship too early you can miss out on gains (See my Tesla example). Splitting the difference is my acknowledgment that I can\u2019t time the market or a stock perfectly. \n\nAnyhow, I hope this didn\u2019t come across as a lecture. I just wanted to commiserate with how you\u2019re feeling, having been there before. Please go easy on yourself.",

I sold again at $200, and $400, and $695, and $880. \n\nIf I had just let it all ride I would have made about 4x more profit. Do I regret not just holding in a company I believed in? A piece of me does, but overall? No way.\n\nI don't have a crystal ball, and Tesla could have died or peaked at any time in the last 8 years. I still have a significant portion in Tesla, and have profited enough to buy a Tesla. How could I possibly regret that?",

If you sold at $320 and it went to $2000 you'd be opining about how you paper handed and lost out on profits.  The fact of the matter is that the \"short thesis\" for GME which was once a long shot proved to be correct.  What fucked up many people's decision making was the uncertainty of whether the price collapse (1/28 - 2/1) was due to market manipulation or if the bubble had burst.  \n\nThe truth is no one fucking knew what was going to happen and the \"I told you so\" people are completely full of shit.  If you leaned more conservative AND took your money out at the top you're now a genius (survivor bias).  But if the short squeeze was allowed to happen and you were in 6 figures the tables would be flipped.  Don't be dejected for making the wrong decision in a completely FUBAR scenario.  How much money you make in the market is always going to be a combination of informed decision making, risk, and luck.  Just learn all you can from this situation to help you make better ones next time, but make sure you're learning the right ones.  \n\nFor what it's worth, I fall into both camps of selling too early and too late:  Cost basis low teens and sold big chunks @ 40, 80, 200.  Holding shares still (too late?  maybe).",

Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money. After a heady experience of that kind, normally sensible people drift into behavior akin to that of Cinderella at the ball. They know that overstaying the festivities - that is, continuing to speculate in companies that have gigantic valuations relative to the cash they are likely to generate in the future - will eventually bring on pumpkins and mice. But they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one helluva party. Therefore, the giddy participants all plan to leave just seconds before midnight.

I don't have large sums of cash, so I continually invest in a handful of companies over time.  Are you making large initial investments then not re-investing in the same companies?  I guess my question is, why is it better to take profits on the way up rather than holding and compounding your gains via time in market?  Just an inexperienced investor here that is truly curious.

You'd have taken a great position and auctioned most of it of before its true potential was realized. And then what do you do? You put PayPal which has already doubled over the past year.

That's just moving taxed realized gains into a new position that carries a comparable amount of risk.\n\nWhen I invest, I make a thesis. I let the 10Q's and product performance guide my decisions.

Many got burned and had to default and foreclose because their investments had lost so much value it wasn't worth paying the mortgage anymore.\n\nThis past month is starting to feel very similar. I had a friend say \"I've never traded before, but I'm holding $GME till $500 or bust!\" I have another friend who told me he got a second mortgage on his house so he could put more investment into a local startup. The discussion and sentiment feels very similar to pre-2008. The \"friends, family, coworkers telling you about the super risky investments they bought\" index is higher than it's been since 2007 and that scares me a lot.",

                    "comment": "&gt;what do you think about a recession?\n\nThere are good reasons to worry about one, and good reasons not to. Before I get to them, let me say that you, I, and no one else knows. If you're invested for the long-term, then don't worry about it and continue to buy each month. If you're invested for the short term (going to need money to buy a car/home, retirement, etc.), then switch up your investments to enable you to meet your goals and protect against a bear market. \n\nNow that I've said that, we can speculate for fun. Reasons to worry: somewhat higher inflation expectations that could rapidly accelerate because of a boom in demand combined with continued supply disruptions. All of a sudden, there's more money chasing fewer products. Sudden increases in inflation usually cause a market swoon. Even without a sudden uptick, I'm concerned about supply chain problems being a drag for years. I mean, Ford is having to cut production on its most profitable, in-demand product because of a shortage of semiconductors. Semiconductors are literally a core component of the modern economy, so I see that as a particularly worrying case. \n\nReasons not to worry: There is simply huge pent-up demand that may fuel a post-war-like economic boom. Millennials have abandoned urban living en masse and are buying homes and starting families in a truly historic movement. All the difficulties of managing this demand pale in comparison to trying to create it through governmental action. In other words, it's a good problem to have. And the current U.S. government is much more competent than the previous one.",

These kids commenting sound exactly like we did in late 99 or early 2000.   \n You remember the late 90's and how your friend lost $350,000.  I was there but not as a college student.  I was a commissioned sales person selling shit to rich people and my territory was Silicon Valley.  And everyone with a pocket protector and a calculator was rich in Silicon Valley in the days of everyman's stock options.   As you might expect I made a boat load of money in 99, about 5 times my normal income.   So late in 99 and early in 00, I not only kept my 401k and IRA in all equities, but I invested $350,000 of after tax cash in those few months.  Now $250,000 of that was in the stock of companies where either the CEO or another member of the C Suite was a current client.  That way I had a pretty good idea of what they thought at least in general about the direction of their business. The other $100,000 was \"invested\" in two Corvettes.  About 18 months later the $250,000 was nearly completely gone and clearly my best investment had been those 2 Corvettes as they did retain most of their value.   I owned stock in two companies (ADAP and EXDS) that had gone BK.  I owned Cisco at $77/share.  I owned Juniper at $84/sh, $93/sh and $113/sh.   I forget the others.  I did keep my portfolio about 15 years just as a reminder of what can go wrong, but eventually I even got tired of looking at that.\n\nThe same thing will happen again.   Maybe tomorrow, maybe in two years, maybe in 5 years.   I have no idea what will cause the bubble to burst but it will.   And in 20 years these kids will be telling children not yet born about the crash in the decade of the 2020s.  Yet not a single one of those yet to be born kids will pay a bit of attention just as we didn't in 1999.",

I want to keep that front and center, and not lose sight of it. \n\nI did get wrapped up in the GameStop thing. It was my first trade ever. Although I had been watching the markets for years, I just hadn\u2019t been set up life-wise until this year. So... I hear about RC, see the deal with MSFT, and think: \u201cthis company will turn around. I can get in now and make some profit.\u201d Then? Well, we all know what happened. I didn\u2019t have a damn clue about what a short squeeze was, how to capitalize on it, or what options even were, let alone how to trade them. I learned so. fucking. much. those first few weeks. When the first gamma squeeze happened? I set stop losses in a tiered system like you describe in your method. I made my initial investment back, and then took 6x my initial investment in profits. I have no regrets. Yeah, I could\u2019ve made more, and yeah, I think about it, but don\u2019t let it delegate my attitude or other investments. NO WAY. That\u2019s how you get burned. \n\nI still trade, but don\u2019t really want to fuck with meme stocks for awhile. I rolled the GameStop money over into other things, and I\u2019m building exit strategies with real-world achievable goals. I also have a large end-game goal to trading in general, and I think it\u2019s important to have that. It will make me more disciplined in my executions, and not allow me to get lost in the intricacies of each little trade I make. \n\nExcellent post, OP. I believe a lot of us needed to hear it.",

            "comment": "Can you clarify some information?  \n\n\n1. Your friend with the $350k account was running 25-50% margin, so $87.5-$175k in margin, for a total long size of $437.5-$525k.\n2. Your friend received a maintenance call which he was able to meet. This would have indicated that the account had lost about 50% in actual value. So the $350k that he owned is now $175k. The maintenance call would have been between $50-$100k depending on the amount borrowed at the time. Your friend was able to meet that requirement.\n3. Your friend then ended up with a -$13k account, somehow. What exactly were you invested in? I was invested at that time as well and most of the odd stuff at the time didn't drop overnight. Even Enron took around 1.5 years to get wiped out. It was definitely not a light-switch situation where you woke up overnight to a massive loss (except at the end where it went from \\~$4 - $0.75 overnight, but the security wasn't marginable at that point; you would have had to have 100% cash on it.)\n4. Regarding point #2, why was your friend ok receiving calls from the risk desk and subsequently clearing them yet not reducing his risk exposure? It just seems incredibly far-fetched that you'd maintain your exposure across your investments after receiving a call like that. Many people wouldn't be able to meet the requirements of the call (not enough cash on hand), and they would have been liquidated.\n5. Getting back to the -$13k balance; what triggered this? How do you get a negative balance without being closed out if you're not running 2:1 leverage or something greater?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you",

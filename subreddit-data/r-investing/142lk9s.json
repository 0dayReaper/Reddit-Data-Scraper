    "postText": "I've decided to put some money into Short Term US Treasuries by buying them through my broker. I plan to hold them until full maturity. Now this is where I am getting a little confused about the tax implications. If I purchased these short term treasuries through treasury direct and help them until maturity it seems that the only thing to pay taxes on is the interest when the treasury matures. There would be no capital gains involved. Is it the same if I purchase shorter term treasuries through my broker? These are not direct auctions from the government as far as I can tell because they seem to be a few days old. If I hold them until full maturity would they be subject to a tax on the interest in addition to a capital gains tax? The reason I am confused is I see references to both 1099-INT and 1099-B reports being applicable to Treasuries bought on a secondary market.",

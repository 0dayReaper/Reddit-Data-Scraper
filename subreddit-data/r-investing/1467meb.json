    "postText": "Hello fellow market investors.\n\n  \nLet's start with what UNIT does.\n\n* Uniti is a Little Rock, Arkansas-based specialty REIT that acquires and constructs mission-critical communications infrastructure in the form of fiber optics, copper and coaxial broadband networks.\n* They own and operate 137,000 fiber route miles covering 275,000 commercial buildings, with most of its network in the Eastern and Midwestern portions of the U.S. It's one of the 10 largest fiber providers in the U.S. today, and its fiber optic leasing generates about 70% of its total revenue.\n\nNow some research.\n\n* President and CEO Kenny Gunderman purchased 225,000 shares of Uniti Group at an average price of $4.37 in the first week of March, amounting to $983,250. These are historic lows for this company. There aren't many investors in a low prices. The CEO has 14,500 shares at $24.15.(Current share price is $4.25 paying a $0.15 dividend on 6/30/2023 and the ex-date is 6/15.)  \nShort interests are at 109.44% with only 6.5 days to cover.  \nMost recent earnings report, analysts say compared to their peers. Value should be $11.42.\n* Windstream is their biggest customer and some debt pushed out further in the future.\n\nWhen you think about our country, everything runs on the internet. It's the backbone of the digital world. Cell towers, businesses, and residents all require internet and is still expanding. Cell services are moving into the home internet market.  \nPersonally I have an average share price of $3.18 and wouldn't mind another buying opportunity but I don't see any reason for this stock to be any lower.\n\n  \nLet me know your thoughts!  \n\\-Irbs  \n\n\nHappy investing and remember this is my own research. Take ownership on your own gains and/or losses. It's not my fault!",

            "comment": "I think that in order to fully understand this company you need to really dig into the Windstream relationship.  They sued each other, now Uniti is required to invest a lot of money into the network for Windstream and the contract expires in a few years.  I don\u2019t really understand everything but it is a major dynamic for the stock.  Also, they have a ton of debt but also very stable and recurring cash flows.  However they still have to invest a lot on their network.  They recently issued some very expensive debt (12%?) but said that would carry them through to the point where they can operate without additional capital needs.  The CEO talks like they might sell it but it seems like Windstream would be the primary candidate to buy them.  I own the stock but admittedly feel like there\u2019s a lot going on that I don\u2019t completely understand.",

Windstream filed for bankruptcy at some point. Even with their payout ratio only being 34% of FFO it's still a risky play having so many eggs in one basket.",

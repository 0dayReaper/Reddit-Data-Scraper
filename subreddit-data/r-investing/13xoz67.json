    "postText": "I\u2019m somewhat new to options. For the most part I\u2019ve been  selling covered calls to generate a bit of cash every month or so. Accumulating cash and buying shares. \n\nThis time it didn\u2019t go as planned. The shares are now in the money and I\u2019m a few weeks out of expiration on the options. \n\nWhat do people typically do in this situation? \nDo you buy back the contracts? \nHold on and hope the share price drops before the expiration? \n\n**** Is there any financial difference between me paying to buy the calls back now at a premium or letting my share get sold? ****\n\nLet\u2019s assume the stock price is $20 or so more than the strike, does it behove me to buy back the calls or let my shares get sold? Or is the math basically the same? I\u2019d the share price continues to go up, say $5-10 from here, for every $1 up, does the call cost the same to buy back? Is there a formula or website that can help me compute this with hypotheticals? \n\nDidn\u2019t expect these names to pop up so fast so soon. Still making money on the shares, but the options I guess cancels that out.",

            "comment": "Just my 2 cents - but generally speaking when you trade options, you kinda want to have an exit strategy for if the trade goes in your favor or if it goes against your favor.\n\nYour choices depend on your original trade thesis and your current and future thesis on the underlying. For example:\n\nIf you sold the calls at a strike and dte that you think makes the stock overvalued then do nothing and take the assignment and collect your profits.\n\nIf you think that the underlying will be in a range and the stock is fairly valued and you want to hold onto the stock - then roll the call - ie a calendar where you btc the call and write a call further out in dte.\n\nIf you think that the stock will raise even more - you can roll the stock out in time and a higher strike ideally for a credit or even.\n\nIf you are accumulating the underlying and you think that the stock will rise or stay flat, you can turn the spread into a covered strangle and write puts.\n\nThere are other things that you can do - but I tend to favor simpler option writing techniques.",

If not - just look at the appropriate calendar spread where the long call will buy-to-close your your short call.",

If the stock keeps rising its better to buy back the option now to capture that upside.\n\nIf the stock stays flat or drops it will be better to hold or buy back the option the day it expires, but since you cannot really know what will happen its a judgement call",

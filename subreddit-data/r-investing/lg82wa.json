    "postText": "After spending the weekend looking at marijuana stocks to get into before Dems make it legal nationally CRLBF gets my seal of approval. \n\n1. They sell a ton of gummies and edibles. I don't think legalizing weed is going to drastically change the number of people that smoke it or how they get it. But most people in states that it is not legal in will get to enjoy edibles that were previously unavailable to them. Also edibles are easy to scale up the manufacturer and distribution of.\n\n2. Cresco is an American company. I think believe that the Canadian companies don't have as much potential for growth as American ones do. Just my opinion.\n\n3. Cresco is the nation's largest wholesale distributor. This will be huge when every Tom, Dick and Joe starts opening cannabis shops like starbucks. \n\n4. They are virtically intergraded. This makes them more nimble and gives them the ability to change fast when the time comes. \n\nAll marijuana stocks are going to go up. I'd be interested in some discussion about some lesser known small caps.",

Basically limiting all available ETFs by a shit load. It is especially bad since the reason they do this, to minimise risk for retail investors, is completely inversed. I always just wanted to buy a weed ETF, but was not able to. Hence, I 'made my own ETF', exposing me to much greater risk.\n\nI will be forever pissed about this regulation.",

Recently listed on the Nasdaq and they have some super simple yet useful tech. They provide high volume grow solutions with integrated software (SaaS) and even provide consulting services for growers. High operating costs for some reason (they don't manufacture their product). Haven't dug in deep enough to figure out why.\n\n$100MM+ in sales last year from only 3 customers so if legalization ever catches up to demand, then this company would be the play. Their products can also be used for general indoor farming as well, so they have a large market.",

            "comment": "Wrong one one point. \"Every Tom Dick and joe will start opening shops\"....have you read about the market in Florida? They are handing it over to large chain conglomerates and making it impossible for anything but a monopoly. The average smoke shop owner or aspiring dispensary owner will not be able to afford to operate in FL. \n\nWith USA legalization not being universal you are better off investing in Canada or an ETF like MJ. States may pass it but not every state has the same laws and those laws are then approved or not approved by each county in some states. In Oregon for example, many eastern counties do not allow the sale of recreational weed while much of the western portion of the state does. Despite it being legal to have in the entire state. \n\nWith passage of legal weed you will have a new wave of smokers (even to try once) that were scared of getting arrested before. Then you have the whole tourism industry that will spring up around legal weed as backwards states will almost certainly delay passing. Plus the gross mischaracterization of what it is like to find a street dealer was a huge deterrent.",

It\u2019s easy for children to accidentally eat them, so there\u2019s a high risk that regulators ban or restrict candy-like edibles. Furthermore, edibles have high concentrations whose effects are very delayed, so they are harder to dose, which is another reason for strict regulation.

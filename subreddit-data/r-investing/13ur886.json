    "postText": "Hi all, as far as I can tell, MSCI no longer publishes the weight of EM in its global index. Is there a more or less accurate way to calculate the weight of EM in the MSCI index based on the data they do publish for the index (e.g. a percentage for holdings in china)? Many thanks ahead!",

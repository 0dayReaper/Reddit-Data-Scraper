            "comment": "IMO the money here is the ability for the kiosks to upsell compared to humans taking your order. I'm sure they have data showing the average order size is larger through a kiosk than human.\n\nKiosks let you browse the menu better and with photos of all items, they can try to upsell you to make it a meal, upsize, etc 100% of the time, they can push promotions and specials, they encourage browsing more of the menu as there's less of a time crunch to complete your order. All around I think it's a great move for the long run.",

For example, boomers that aren't tech-saavy generally don't like the kiosks. Anecdotally, my mother refuses to use them even if the line for the register is long and the kiosk is free.\n\nBut on the other hand, younger orderers might just use mobile orders on their phone.",

I vastly prefer it, and early on I could basically expect anywhere with self-checkout or automated kiosks would have one open for me whenever I wanted. A few years later, it's quite common for every self-checkout or ordering kiosk at a given store to be in use most of the time.\n\nI expect this trend to continue. I get plenty of social interaction without talking to cashiers and I think that's true of a lot of people, for whom the time savings are a big deal.",

They sound like a great way to replace humans but they are much slower at collecting orders and create longer lines and ultimately it is faster and more profitable to have an \"expert\" human take the order and money. Kiosks are an old technology and a good chunk of people are going to struggle using the kiosks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, many younger people hate interacting with humans and may prefer kiosks.

It frees up a worker to carry orders out to tables, which families may find especially helpful. \n\nAnd the pictures are helpful in upselling and decision making, giving infrequent visitors time and opportunity to get everything that they would like. \n\nFinally, customizations are limited on the kiosks, helping to keep things simple for the kitchen as well.

When you first started at McDonalds, how long did it take you to be trained on the system?  Generally the faster the system the longer training takes. When I first started working at Dominos we used a text based system. It was amazingly fast, but employees had to use a reference chart (or eventually memorization) for toppings because they were input as letters.   A large deluxe for example would have been input as pogms  Pepperoni, Onions, Green peppers, Mushrooms, Sausage.   For less common toppings the letters didn't align to the words.   Black Olives were R,  Bacon was K.  (cause b was ground b, and o was onions and c was extra cheese.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExtremely effective, but it took quite a bit of training, and new employees would still be asking questions about how to input something after a few months when they ran into something new.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen we changed to a new touch screen graphical system.  Took a lot less training, but orders took twice as long, and customization took longer.  Compared to the online ordering it was still great though. Online took even longer, and wouldn't even allow some of the customizations we used to do.  Philly Cheese Steak Pizzas for example used american cheese instead of sauce.  We used to be able to add american cheese as a sauce option for any pizza, but to order it online, you have to order a philly and removed just about every topping and add what you wanted instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  realized part 2 of the story was also applicable.",

I believe it's because they're using the opportunity to advertise to you.  It's possible to make a fast, intuitive system but they choose to make you scroll through huge pictures of the products.

They could also opt for buying a gift card from me so they can use the kiosk for their full order, although that rarely happened.\n\nThe Kiosk served a very specific demographic when I was around. People who were socially awkward around cashiers and wanted to avoid them, people who don't want to wait in line during a busy hour, and, usually, young adults from 18-30.\n\nThis demographic shrinks even more when there's a promotion or discount going on at our place, because the Kiosk sucked at redeeming those, meaning you either had to forfeit your discount or deal with a human being.\n\nAnd finally, to put the icing on the cake, here are the following issues the Kiosks bring to Managers:\n\n-You have to assign an employee to refill its paper consistently if it's in high usage (they used to waste a ton of paper, it's a bit better now but still)\n\n-People will constantly ask your employees for help concerning how to use them, at very little pay off (since they rarely end up using them after, commenting that it's so much easier just to order regularly)\n\n-It constantly has problems. And the guy who fixes them only shows up one day a week. Meaning if you're counting on the kiosks to replace some if your cashiers, oh boy are you screwed.\n\n-People break them with misuse, see the previous point for details.\n\n-Sometimes the Kiosk will screw up the order, and you'll have to step in with your manager override stuff to refund an order, correct it, whatever, and before you claim human error, the kiosk fucked up at a ratio of 10:1 to what a normal employee does, 30:1 if you only count experienced employees.\n\nNow sure, if they invest enough money, the Kiosks will eventually save a restaurant a few cashiers, but it will be a hell of an investment, with many drawbacks, and you'll have to buy a much better kiosk if you want ANY shot at saving money, which will be an even bigger investment, and you'll still need a cashier, cause like it or not, there's technologically illiterate people.",

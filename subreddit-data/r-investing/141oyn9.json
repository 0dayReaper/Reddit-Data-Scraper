XYZ stock is trading at 55 and I write a 1 CSP for 50.\n\nNow i have 6k + premium - fees on my account.\n\nIf I use the cash to buy another stock and sell it before the CSP gets exercised, will that be considered as using margin? Will I be charged interest even if doesn't get exercised?\n\nDoes it differ brokerage to brokerage?",

            "comment": "In your example - you are only charged margin if you are assigned on your short put and your cash balance goes negative.\n\nMargin accrues on a settlement to settlement basis. So if you sell the other stock and it settles before the assignment on the put settles, margin fees are not accrued.\n\nIt how many people generate yield on cash when writing puts - by holding treasuries and money market mutual funds - since mutual funds settle T+1 and equities settle T+2.",

As soon as the available cash is no longer sufficient to cover your purchases, you will use your margin and hence triggers the payment of interest.\"",

Most reps would not understand the question because most reps are barely trained in options that aren\u2019t long calls. You should always take the time to be transferred to your brokerages trade desk if that\u2019s an option.",

I would have expected it to impact your buying power and margin.\n\nWho's your broker?\n\n\\[edit\\] fwiw - my comments are based on the assumption that you are asking about a US domiciled margin account that is subject to Reg-T.

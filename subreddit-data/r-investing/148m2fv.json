    "postText": "Hi everyone! After a year and a half of owning our first property, my partner, and I will be having to move over 400 miles from where we\u2019re currently living due to work. This will be our first time going through the process of having an investment property. I\u2019ve reached out to only one property management company. Over the phone, the person at the property management company gave me a rough estimate of what we\u2019d be able to charge monthly. $400 less than what our mortgage is. Yikes! It was just an estimate based on Ba/Bed and location (were in CA). But we live in a great location so the conversation did leave me a bit nervous. Is a property management company the best option? Any advice, tips or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advanced.",

I heard a story from a friend where the property management company suggested rent rates for a unit that was significantly below current market rates.\n\nIf their estimate was accurate though, definitely sell.  Not worth losing money on it every month.",

Also, Reach out to your real estate agent if they have any specific references. \n\n2. Evaluate digital management options that would help you manage your property from abroad. (Example: Hemlane. Not endorsing it or am sponsored, just saying it\u2019s an example)\n\n3. Sell it. In this market and less than 5 years ownership you would probably sell for a loss but if it\u2019s in a great area you really never know. Prices in the \u201cin demand\u201d area near me haven\u2019t dropped and still sell quickly. \n\n4. Get comfortable with it being a money drain in your pocket.",

I mean, being a small time owner is basically like buying a part time job. Still, my experience is that property managers just aren't going to take as good of care of it as you. Maybe you are lucky. \n\nI mean, you hope to make a profit. So do they.\n\nYour nut with rentals comes with time. The mortgage gets paid down. The market rate for rent increases over time. Even then, some years it might just suck, as you might have a huge or unexpected expense. \n\nIf you can't swing it... sell it and put that money into something that is less work, worry, and obligation.",

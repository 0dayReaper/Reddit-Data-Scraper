                    "comment": "&gt; I'm wondering how day trading super volatile assets like the above can lead to such huge losses?\n\nIt almost certainly involves shorting or options.\n\nShorting is borrowing a share of stock and then selling that share. You make money by buying it back later for a lower price. So your maximum profit on the trade is the price of the share if/when the price goes to 0. Your losses are potentially infinite because the price of the stock could 10x, 100x, 1000x, etc and you would be obligated to buy the share at the new price.\n\nOptions are very complicated but are essentially the above but with financial instruments that multiply the gains/losses. So instead of dealing with individual shares, you deal with contracts that deal with hundreds of shares. You can play either side of the trade (betting the price will either go up or down), but the losses are effectively infinite in many cases.",

If that is not a factor (in my case it isn't) then it is just a preference.  \n\nIf you sell the LT Losses now, you get a tax break, and assuming the stock goes up, you would just have a higher tax liability on the larger LT gains of the other lots down the road.\n\nOn the contrary if you sell the LT Gains now, you pay the taxes, and assuming the stock goes up, you would have a lower relative tax liability on the remaining LT lots down the road.\n\nIf I'm thinking correctly, the overall tax liability across time is the same barring any outside influences to the tax treatment (regulation changes, other personal tax strategies, etc.)",

Now, I\u2019m trying to plan long term for retirement. Some of the investments I tried making have (of course), totally failed. I have four stocks sitting that have a total gain of -86% or higher. I\u2019m tired of seeing them and combined - these four stocks shifted from the initial investment value of $4900 to $160 today. Admittedly I was embracing taking on the risk but now would like to plan for conservative to moderate risk. Overall the portfolio is in a much better place and growing better than these but I wanted someone\u2019s advice if I should hold on to them in some desperate hope they climb back up to break even or just sell, take what I get and put it into a mutual fund to try to regrow.

And choosing an investment adviser usually depends on what you need and want. \n\nMost people do not really need those types of services unless they have financial situations which are more complex than the average investor. \n\nAssuming that you are in the US - the vast majority of investors start out by simply opening a retail brokerage account at one of the larger brokers which provide good customer service. Brokers like Fidelity and Schwab are good brokers. Some brokers are subsidiaries of banks so if you have a bank that you like - their brokerage services may be sufficient - for example MerrillEdge is part of Bank of America, etc. \n\nGenerally, if you are unfamiliar with investing - just stick to broad based index funds. \n\nYour first step is probably to decide on where to open your brokerage account.",

I choosed \"iShares Core S&amp;P 500\" with symbol \"CSPX.UK\"  (traded in USD, in London). I also found \"SXR8.DE\" traded in EUR, in Frankfurt.\n\nSo my question is: Are these two the same fund, only listed on different exchanges with different symbol ? Does even matter which one I choose ?  I live in Czech Republic and we use CZK so i have to convert currency anyway. Trading in EUR would be little more confortable due to SEPA payments in EU. Are there some other considerations for long term - not so risky - investing ? \n\nThank you.\n\nPavel",

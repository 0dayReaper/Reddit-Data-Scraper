It\u2019s unequivocal that prenups trump rules like communal property in the vast vast majority of cases even though there are never any binding guarantees (just like with investing or anything else).\n\nEven in California you can take simple steps to make a prenup enforceable. Get a lawyers consult for each spouse and have the lawyers write the contract. Cases where the courts have overturned a genuinely mutual agreement are very rare and it\u2019s basically stuff like dropping a document they don\u2019t understand in front of someone to sign or trying to wing it yourself and writing in unenforceable terms that get struck down.",

It might be the best initial option rather than taking a large amount of risk that they don't fully understand.  I would advocate for scaling into risk based on your level of capital, risk tolerance and comfort level over time and generally indexing outperforms the majority of fund managers even inflation adjusted.  That doesn't mean risk is bad it just means most people and professional money managers will underperform the indexes when investing.",

[https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/the-science-behind-money-and-emotion](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/the-science-behind-money-and-emotion)\n\nInvesting takes years (really, decades) to pan out. So if you're responding to short term market events (debt ceiling is a good current example, but there's always something in the news) you will find yourself timing the market, and failing miserably at it like most people.

And using something like a low cost Target Date Fund (or frankly, if you need it, a robo advisor) will stop you from wanting to \"tweak\" the allocation or worse flee to cash when markets are down.",

I patiently waited through the IPO (initial public offering) as I knew the price would likely go up right away at the opening bell. I waited a good 3 months to let the dust settle. I bought at a great price and made a very nice profit 3 years later in 2015 when I decided to sell. I did sell prematurely as the price continued to rise. But I made a good profit nonetheless. Well instead of putting those gains in good blue chip dividend stocks, etf's and reits I got excited about penny stocks in the burgeoning cannabis sector. At one point I grew my portfolio to a very nice 6 figures. At that point-around the end of 2017 to the beginning of 2018-I could have taken a very handsome profit. Had I sold all my positions I would have realized a 4 x on my profit. But no. I got greedy. I held on thinking I would make a million. I saw my hard earned money turn to a couple grand. It's a terrible thing to experience. But I am glad it happened. It taught me a valuable lesson. TAKE PROFITS. Always. Stay away from OTC stocks. While Cannabis was hyped up for a while (remember Tilray) the entire sector really turned out to be a dud.",

Were you expecting to turn your spare change from last summer's job, into next semester's tuition?  It don't work that way.  \"Investing\" is not some magical, painless \u00abthing\u00bb that makes everyone rich.\n\nHitting $10,000 for the first time in your retirement account is a milestone; celebrate it.  Hitting $100,000 -- SEVERAL years later -- will be one too.  Somewhere in there, will be a year when investment performance is a larger number than your annual contributions; savor it!  By the time you hit $500,000 -- OOH, HALF A MILLION! -- you will be about 75% of the way to retirement; it's the last ten years that gain you the most.",

No more rolling from stocks to bonds and back.\n\nMy only concern these days is being able to invest more. I'm not complaining, but my new worry or sport is to free up as much cash as I can to invest. I'm not worried about day to day or month to month performance, and if I feel something in my other 20% investment allocation needs to change I only change future investments.\n\nGood luck!",

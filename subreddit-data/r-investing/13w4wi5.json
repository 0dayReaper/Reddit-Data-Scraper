    "postText": "Protalix (PLX) is set to receive a $20 million milestone payment from its partner Chiesi upon the FDA approval of Elfabrio. Protalix is also eligible to receive up to $1 billion in regulatory and commercial milestone payments in addition to tiered royalties. The company expects cash &amp; equivalents to increase to $51.6 million after receiving the $20 million milestone payment. That represents a 56.4% increase over Protalix's cash &amp; equivalents of $33 million.\n\nThe company is expected to be profitable in 2023 w/ a continuation of profitability in 2024.  The stock sold off recently after a strong run-up before the FDA approval. I see a buy the dip opportunity here.",

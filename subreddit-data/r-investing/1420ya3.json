    "postText": "Let's say I want to put on a merger arbitrage trade. Company X plans to acquire Company Y in an all-stock deal, 1 share of Company X for 1 share of Company Y. Market doesn't think the deal will go through so there so is a significant premium - let's say Company X trades at $10 and Company Y trades at $6.\n\nI buy Company Y and sell Company X, since I anticipate price convergence, but I also want to hedge my risks by buying a $10 call on Company X. Now I'm nicely hedged, but I'm paying theta on this option that I might have to hold for months. Is there any way to minimized the bleed, or am I just resigned to paying it to \"lock in\" this final payoff?",

                    "comment": "Thanks! First response on here from someone who understands what I\u2019m trying to get at. Makes sense that it\u2019s overkill - my main concern is just if I am leaving money on the table, then why should I behave suboptimally, right?\n\nYou said I\u2019m long theta, but since I\u2019m long the call I\u2019d be short, not long (i.e. paying theta). So that would just mean I\u2019m long gamma and can sell this gamma that is useless to me to hedge that out. So I suppose I could gamma scalp on Company X, which I really don\u2019t want to do because (a) I don\u2019t really know how, and (b) transaction costs. \n\nYour idea of selling the straddle is intriguing but it seems like a very dirty hedge, but I suppose that\u2019s really the only option if I don\u2019t want to gamma scalp on Company X. It does make sense provided that there is a high R-squared on the beta/tight correlation. But can I ask why a straddle, and not a strangle, or just sell a call on the index (since you\u2019re long a call on Company X)? \n\nThanks for the info - if you feel like responding to this I\u2019d appreciate it, if not, no worries",

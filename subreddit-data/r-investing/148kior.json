    "postText": "Long story short- been in training for my job the past 10 years or so. Now I\u2019m about to start work and will finally start making some serious $$. I was hoping there\u2019d be a period of time to buy some ETF, stocks at a discount but everything is so expensive. \n\nI feel like the best time to buy was before such a strong retail interest in investing and trading. Literally every dip gets eaten up and I feel like that\u2019s been the case the past few years as retail has shown a stronger interest. Surely this has done *something* to algorithmic trading and has pushed markets higher. I admit that\u2019s purely speciation, though. \n\nThere are multiple trillion dollar companies now. Before Covid\u2014 just 3 years ago\u2014 the idea of a trillion dollar company was pretty absurd. Now Apple is pushing 3 trillion and people somehow feel that\u2019s justified and the new normal. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m just too grumpy about it. We had multiple bank failures and the market recovered really quickly. I thought maybe there\u2019d be a lasting effect in which I could put some solid money into the market over the next year from this, but nope, just keeps going up. \n\nAm I totally wrong to feel this way?",

Sold all my positions and never found the right time to get back in. \n\nMy cash just sat there until 2020 when it crashed again.

Basically, on avg and over the long term, the sooner you get your money into the stock market the better you will do. If you're still contributing to the account and have a longer time horizon, the chance that you'll find a better entry point than today and make the investment on that day is basically zero.

Trust me, it's a great time to be an investor historically. There's a lot to unpack in your post.\n\n\"stocks at a discount\" - usually stocks that are on sale, or trade at a discount, have a good reason for doing so.  Even if you had this scenario, it may not be the panacea you're expecting.\n\n\"strong retail interest\" - this is a good thing, not a bad thing.  This keeps spreads tighter, provides a more efficient market via liquidity, and keeps the markets healthy.\n\n\"multiple trillion dollar companies\" - You can mitigate these risks with proper diversification.\n\nThe problem I see, is you are waiting to invest due to risks you see in the market.  Put your energy into understanding an mitigating those risks and get started!  Every investor faces the risks you present.  The fact you know about these risks and have concerns, means you are already a step ahead when it comes to the long term game!  You just need to learn how to mitigate these risks.  Perhaps start slowly, maybe buy a brokerage 3 mo CD at 5% or so, then research how bond returns work, what are the risks?  What makes them go up and down?  Should I own the actual bonds or buy an ETF?  what's the big difference in terms of risk versus one or the other?  Trickle in small amounts over time to spread your price points.  Worried about mega cap tech in the S&amp;P 500?  Maybe add a mid cap ETF or research equal-weighting.  Whatever your concern, you can mitigate it with homework.\n\nIf you wait, you'll have to figure this all out anyway once you jump in, so why not start now.  People wait for sales on Black Friday, for that fantastic bargain, only to get crushed in lines at Costco when the doors open.  Only to find out that the TV was an easy dump for the company who can't get rid of that 3 year old model with firmware issues and bad pixels.  Keep your chin up!  You can do it!",

Maybe some long term treasuries, TLT or VGLT or GOVZ, depending on your age (if you're under 40, probably don't bother, if you're under 30, definitely don't bother). If you have a 401k, you may not have those exact options, so just invest in whatever US total market index fund or S&amp;P 500 index fund and an international index fund they offer you, or all in a target date fund. Stick with it for a while. Learn about factor investing once you've held onto those for a few years and decide if you think the theory behind it is good. \n\nObsessing over buying the dip or whether something is overvalued or if you've \"missed out\" is going to cost you far more money in the long run.",

Pour your earnings into retirement vehicles until they overflow, then into non-tax-advantaged accounts in broad, low-cost index funds with low yields. Watch the coin multiply.\n\nWhen I was 21 I had been admitted to an excellent MD/PhD program (BME was my program of choice, I wanted to do orthopedic surgery and run a biomaterials lab in academia), but my mom developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. I declined the offer and cared for her through 7 years of remission/recurrence, then went into engineering, then management, then executive level. I didn't even have a bachelor's degree until I was 33. \n\nThe experience turned me cold for a bit. Seeing everyone traveling and getting married in the interim. My response was to save 70% of my net income minus loan payments. It was catharsis by pain. I drove a 19 year old Toyota when I was running a group of 20 people. Looking back now, this self-flagellating exercise in frugality was the best choice of my life. \n\nThe bull markets early in your investing career matter LEAST. By far. The most important part is the timing of your last bull run with respect to de-risking reallocation. If you go from 90/10 to 30/70, for example, at the end of a long bull run you'll be in a very different category than if you did it after a major drop off, so be flexible about retirement date.\n\nThat's it, you're all set.",

Since everyone's expecting it, everyone's sitting on the sidelines with lots of cash assets just waiting for a dip. Which means that whenever there is a dip, everyone floods in. It's hard to have a recession that everyone is waiting for, which is why it looks like the bottom was back in October.\n\nOf course, these things can also come out of nowhere.

Scenario 1: the market crashes 50% over the first 12 months and the rallies at a 15% annual rate over the next 108 months. Scenario two, reverse. The rally then the crash. Both cases, if you had a lump sum, you make about 5.8%. No difference. But with the dollar cost averaging, scenario 1 you make about $130,000 total returns, and scenario two you lose $3,000.\n\nThe takeaway? Don\u2019t be afraid of a market crash. Pray for one. Your wealth is so low and your earning potential so high you should be socking away as much as possible and hope it goes down every month.",

In the next 6 and 1/2 years by 2030 we need to be spending four trillion dollars a year on climate transition assets. Last year we're spending somewhere around $680 billion. This is the greatest opportunity of making money on the planet. We haven't even spent 4 trillion dollars combined in the last 17 years that sustainable finance has been around.\n\nGive your head a shake and open your eyes. You clearly have more understanding to do.",

Stock prices WILL go up and down, and the best thing is to use the dollar cost average strategy\u2014regularly putting in the same amount to the stocks over time\u2014which in the long run will even out. Use an app like Robinhood that lets you buy at small amounts and set up automated investing over time.

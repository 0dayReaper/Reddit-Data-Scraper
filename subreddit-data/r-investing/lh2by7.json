    "postText": "I've been investing for a couple years. Most of my stock picks have been large cap companies, lots of tech and consumer products. I follow trends, buy the dip, yadda yadda.\n\nAbout a year ago I started putting extra money into ETFs. For those, I have focused on tech heavy funds, clean energy, next gen stuff- all Vanguard or low cost funds. Now that my portfolio is split evenly between individual stocks and ETFs, I've noticed a surprising trend:\n\nMy ETFs beat my stock picks almost every day. Today is a great example- in a mixed market, my individual stocks are (collectively) down -$195, but my ETFs are (collectively) up $110. And it is like this fairly consistently. On a good day for the markets as a whole, my ETFs are always beating my stock picks. Sure, there are times I have an individual stock that might pop and outperform my ETFs, but more regularly, my collective stock picks rarely outperform my collection of ETF picks.\n\nI guess I am just saying that I am done trying to pick the next winning stock, spending my valuable time pouring over charts and digging through the news for rumors. I am liquidating my individual stocks and dumping it all back into my ETF picks at the next market dip.\n\n[edit] SO MANY PEOPLE asking what my ETF picks are. I am not a financial expert, so I don't claim that these are the best, but I have: VGT QQQJ VOO SCHA ARKK and VBIX (which is a mutual fund, not an ETF). My plan is to add some crypto, maybe another ARK, and at least one ETF that focuses on low volatility to hedge against a falling market.",

And most research indicates that most of that 10% can be efficiently captured using diversified factor exposure rather than trying to make discretionary stock picks. \n\nPicking individual stocks felt like a lot of effort with the outcome dominated by the market and idiosyncratic risk. \n\nI still enjoy understanding investing research, but my investment strategies focus on asset and risk factor allocation.",

But like dieting, the best investment strategy is the one you can actually stick to.\n\nSo if you know certain things about your personality - you can do \"sub optimal\" strategies to help mitigate them.\n\nFor example:  I hate personal debt.  Yes, I logically know I should leverage the shit out of my home due to historically low interest rates - but instead I want to pay off my mortgage.\n\nEvery financial advisor worth their salt in the world would say that's stupid - use leverage on your real estate purchase and put that money to work in the market in the meanwhile.  I agree.  But for me, psychologically it's like a sword of damocles over my head every day.\n\nI found after a couple years of having said mortgage it was severely impacting my risk aversion.  Overall I would have been better off simply paying off my mortgage aggressively so I \"felt better\" as it would have meant putting far more money into the market vs. being scared on the sideline with far too much cash.\n\nSo - in the end I know I'm giving up a few percentage points of gains a year on my net worth.  But before that, I was giving up 10% yearly gains by being too conservative to the point of fearfulness.\n\nSo, tldr; stick with the most optimized investment strategy you can *personally stick with long term without going insane* - the trick of course is knowing you are consciously making those tradeoffs!",

Providing you\u2019re setting a stop loss, and/or ready to sell before it collapses completely.\n\nI can understand the hard empirical data point of view that, if you think it still has upside potential, you should leave all the capital in to maximise those returns - and if you don\u2019t think there\u2019s upside potential, why does the money remain on the table?

It can't just keep trading multiple times above its realistic valuation, otherwise it will be this controversial stock forever. At some point it either has to have a correction or plateau until the company catches up with the price. Personally I think it will keep trading like this until the next big crash, whether that be next week or the next decade. So many people have made so much on it that it will be an obvious one to drop when things get sketchy.\n\nAll that being said, I'm a shareholder and a huge fan of the company. Tesla will likely be responsible for a considerable portion of my retirement savings. I just get stressed now and then simply knowing that one day my account will get fucking demolished and I'm gonna have to swallow that big ass pill. I literally hope for a correction soon, just so I (and many, many others) can feel better about holding it.",

I recommend reading \"A Random Walk Down Wall St.\" for anyone who has doubts about that. \n \nThe best (and most boring) approach for the vast majority of people is DCA/periodic investment in broad market indexes. It's very difficult/impossible to consistently time the market to avoid sell-offs or catch run-ups. Most likely you will end up sitting in cash and missing out on capital appreciation when it happens.\n \nA good analogy for beating the market: you have 1,000 people in a room, each with a coin, then you ask them all to flip their coins. Anyone who flipped tails has to leave. Should be left with about 500 people now. Now repeat that - anyone who flips tails again has to leave. Should be about 250 left.\n \nNow, repeat that 8 more times. Statistically speaking, you should be left with about 1 person who has now flipped heads 10 times in a row. In such a simplified scenario it should be pretty obvious that the 1 person who has flipped heads 10 times does not have some special skill in flipping heads, but rather is a result of the simple statistical outcomes you would expect when starting with 1,000 people. \n \nFor some reason, people have a much harder time accepting that the same is true for stock picking, even though there is *tons* of data that supports the idea that it is just that - pure statistical chance. It presents nearly exactly the same way. \n \nSo sure, out of hundreds of millions or billions of market participants, there are bound to be people who are dead right on every single one of their stock picks, however there is no evidence that it has any relationship to how smart they are, how much research they do, how well they understand markets, economics, any of that. It's pure chance. \n \nThat said, there's nothing *wrong* with trying out a few speculative trades in a wildly exuberant market. You may hit on a few big returners, just don't let that convince you that you can do it consistently and in every market environment. Set aside a small percentage (maybe 10%) of your portfolio to allocate to risky/speculative plays, and park the rest in \"boring\" investments and forget about it.",

Many are examining a time range where people didn't have access to the internet or when the majority of people were barely even using the internet. I don't think it's possible to overestimate how big of a deal the Internet is in empowering retail investors.\n\nAlso not only do those studies examine a meaningless time period, but they also include people who day trade, swing trade, try to time the market, don't know basic principles when it comes fundamental analysis and everything in between.\n\nThose studies probably don't apply to a lot of people here. A study that examines the average person in a population is meaningless to a person who isn't average, or isn't part of the time period or environment that the study took place in.",

No one predicted that.\n\nWe won't know for another 10+ years whether that strategy is sustainable. There's still potential for a tech bubble burst on the horizon (imagine we were having this discussion in February 2000).",

You can set and forget them and pull in just as much money as TSLA without relying on pure dumb luck. I wouldn't recommend the leveraged ones right now though because the VIX is pretty high, but if it falls under 20 then those are good buys.\n\nAlso keep an eye out on the fed, you do not want to be holding leveraged products if the fed removes their support from the market, its pretty much the only thing keeping this bubble inflated right now.",

When you look at the american stock market, the S&amp;P 500 and the nasdaq are what people look at, and its also what the government looks at.\n\nIf the russell or some international market falls down, nobody cares. If the S&amp;P or nasdaq fall, you are going to see government / fed intervention happen to pump them back up. \n\ntldr; SPY / QQQ are straight up rigged, and thats why I like them the most.",

            "comment": "ETFs are just collections of stocks weighted by a metric. There\u2019s nothing magical about them. If your stock picks are underperforming your ETFs, it\u2019s likely that your weighting mechanisms aren\u2019t effective or that you\u2019ve picked companies which carry a lower geometric mean vs the ETFs that you\u2019re investing in.\n\nWithout specific information (eg. I picked Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix and Google at 25% each, but have consistently lost in terms of CAGR vs (insert ETF)), no one will be able to offer any kind of logical conclusion as to why you\u2019re underperforming. If you\u2019re invested in a high volatility ETF (eg ARK*), and you\u2019re comparing it to your performance, you need to once again look at your holdings and their monthly individual geometric mean. As an overly simple example, a 50/50 split between Tesla and Shopify has a running CAGR of about 100% per year for the past 5 years; this would have outperformed almost any ETF that you can pick including certain leveraged ones like TQQQ. This comes with trade offs (reasons not to do this), but it is an example of \u201cpicking stocks\u201d.\n\nBottom line it\u2019s not that picking stocks is inherently less favorable vs an ETF, but picking stocks depends on what your targets are (volatility, drawdown expectations, Sharpe/Sortino ratios that you\u2019re targeting, etc.)",

            "comment": "Maybe at 53 I'm just too close to Boomer age, but does anyone else prefer mutual funds to ETFs?  I had a bad initial experience (probably 15-20 years ago) with ETFs because I bought one that was thinly traded and, as a result, it traded significantly below it's NAV.  Coming from a mutual fund world, that pissed me off and made no sense to me.  But since ETFs are traded like stocks, and the price is determined based upon supply and demand, it does make sense.  Don't have that issue with mutual funds.\n\nBut as to the OP's overall point, I think a lot of us get to that point eventually.  Either because the ETFs/Funds seem to perform better, or (like me) just because they are so much less work and effort.  I moved everything (sans a few individual stocks I still dabble in) to mutual funds probably 12 years ago.\n\nMy research now consists of tracking them to make sure nothing goes haywire, but only doing true research about every 3-5 years when I rebalance my portfolio.  That sure beats spending hours every week running stock screens, reading press releases and combing over SEC filings.\n\nAnd it seems to have served me well.  My 5-, 3- and 1-year trailing annual returns right now are 17.38%, 15.06% and 30.12%.  That beats the S&amp;P 500 Index, and that's really all I'm trying to do.  If I can do that with minimal effort (while also have some money constrained in limited-option 401k accounts), I'll take it.",

Time is better spent focused on building a skillset that does provide value.\n\nAnd the case can also be made that timing the market is a fruitless pursuit. \"Time in the market beats timing the market.\" This point has been a bit harder for me to take though. It's clear that circumventing my human tendency to gamble by buying indexes makes sense. It's less clear that paying attention to general trends and working to avoid \"bubbles\" is a waste of time, especially in the current market. But I'm only 30, so I figure that my investing horizon is far enough out that any hiccups in the market will be recovered and irrelavent enough by the time I'm drawing on my funds / switching to bonds that it won't matter.",

If there's no overlap, it's a cool idea. Keep an eye on the trends and if it drops off, time to sell them.",

With all this liquidity flooding all over the place, the best performing stocks are no longer the ones that everyone already owns and has eyes on, but the lesser known microcaps that suddenly get a boost.",

Thing is, as they get bigger, there might be a real issue being as flexible as they have been; some of their positions they will struggle to get out of. Interesting to watch, shame they don't do a euro version directly. I do think they will get bounced in a downturn unless she has a trick she can turn. Actually, that sounds a bit perverted.",

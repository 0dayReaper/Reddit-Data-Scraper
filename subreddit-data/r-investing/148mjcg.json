    "postText": "My wife and I file jointly and we make over the max income for Roth IRAs. On her own she has a job and makes 80k. I have my own Roth IRA that I made through the back door process. Is she able to do this as well or would that create some sort of IRS problem? I would be funding both of these, though me funding her account could be done indirectly as we have separate bank accounts.",

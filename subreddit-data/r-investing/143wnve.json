I recently moved some money in my Fidelity brokerage account from my \"core position\" (SPAXX, short term government t-bills, cash-like) to another money market fund, SPRXX - Fidelity Money Market Fund.\n\nIf you look at the fund description, it says \"as of 06/06/2023, +4.78%\" gains. However, the NAV is $1.00, and in the gain/loss/value columns in my account ([see here](https://imgur.com/a/o5bGd56)) in the SPRXX row, it says N/A. Where do my gains/losses appear?",

I have my stocks too but right now I am about 60% money market funds and that is probably going to keep my 10 year average for investing above 12\u201313% and on the year above zero.  I\u2019ll take 5% in this climate.\n\nI\u2019ll also try and pick some winners.",

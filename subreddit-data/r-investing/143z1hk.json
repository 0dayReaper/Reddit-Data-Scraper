    "postText": "I've recently inherited a large sum of money including cash and my financial advisor is suggesting I look into a Unified managed Account (UMA) as another avenue for investing in a taxable account and for tax purposes.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've never heard of a UMA until today.  I've never seen it even mentioned on the financial forums.  Anyone have any personal or professional experience with these types of investments?",

            "comment": "A UMA is essentially just a brokerage account (or accounts) your advisor has full discretion over. They're somewhat similar to how roboadvisors work and will generally follow predefined models the advisor or his firm have designed plus some customization for your specific needs. Review the fee schedules and determine if this sort of professional management is even needed.",

            "comment": "A UMA and UMHA (unified managed household) isn't a type of investment. It's a type of account with multiple sub-sleeves and sub-accounts that may hold different types of investments and/or strategies.\n\nRebalancing and tax harvesting can be done on a sub-account/sleeve level and also on the whole account.\n\nUsually each sub-account/sleeve may have a different model from a different subadviser.\n\nThese are discretionary accounts. I think that some UMA/UMH programs can support a non-discretionary and self-managed sub-account/sleeve as well.\n\nMost decent UMA/UMHA programs support restrictions as well in case you want to specify stocks or types of investments that you don't want to own.\n\nIn contrast to an SMA (separately managed account) - UMA/UMHA fees are usually a bit higher.\n\nI don't know if current UMA/UMHA programs have more features and bells/whistles these days since it's been a while when I was involved with them.\n\n\\[edit\\] - there are also a bunch of other features and nuances in these types of programs. For example - being able to handle overlapping wash sales between subaccounts. Handling tax optimization between taxable and non-taxable accounts. Figuring out tax effective yield on fixed income holdings.\n\nAnd in general - the models should ideally hold less funds to maximize tax management optimization opportunities.\n\nAs far as whether it's worth it or not - it really depends on your net worth, complexity of your financial situation, and your personal family obligations. There's no one size fits all answer.",

    "postText": "I know that there are different views on how much to save and some may say as much as possible.  Much of the general guidance says 20% or 30%.  Does that include pre-tax?  Say I shoot for 30% and I put 15% pre-tax into my 401k and my paycheck after tax is $1k.  Since I put 15% pretax would I now put another 15% or $150 into an after tax savings?  Trying to figure out what to be directionaly shooting for here.\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "The rule you're referring to is often called the \"50/30/20 rule,\" which is a budgeting guideline that suggests dividing your after-tax income and spending 50% on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings. However, the exact percentage you should save depends on your individual goals, financial situation, and comfort level.\r  \n\r  \nTo answer your question about whether the percentage includes pre-tax or after-tax income: when it comes to retirement savings like a 401(k), it's common to consider this as part of your overall savings goal, and it's usually calculated as a percentage of your pre-tax income.\r  \n\r  \nIn your example, if you're putting 15% of your pre-tax income into a 401(k), you are already making significant strides towards a savings goal of 30%. You can certainly aim to save an additional 15% of your after-tax income if that's feasible and aligns with your financial goals. However, keep in mind that your net income will be lower due to the money that is being put directly into your 401(k).\r  \n\r  \nAnother way to think about it is this: if your goal is to save 30% of your income, and you're already contributing 15% pre-tax to your 401(k), you're halfway there. You could then aim to save an additional 15% of your after-tax income.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, these are guidelines and not hard and fast rules. Your personal financial goals and situation may dictate saving more or less. It's also important to build an emergency fund and pay off any high-interest debts.",

I could do that for a month for $1500 (including food/housing/flight) by staying at a surf hostel in the jungle.  (Has WiFi, a restaurant, a kitchen, comfy beds, etc.)\n\nI also spend about $20 a week driving to play beach volleyball twice a week.  Which costs nothing in itself.  Neither does surfing when I'm in Florida for six months.  With those my two favorite activities.\n\nPartly because I'm careful with my money, I now own a second place in Florida.  When I go to Central America (etc.) now in the Winter for a month or two, I'm able to rent that condo out for more than the vacation costs.  I'm also able to rent it out for $!0K+ in income over the warmer months, when I'm back in Michigan.  (I'm also able to rent out my Michigan condo while in Florida, so my carrying costs on both properties are more than covered, and I receive additional income from them.)\n\nThe main problem is that people waste money on things that \\*aren't\\* truly important to them, simply because they don't think about it, or their friends are doing the same thing.  Like new cars, expensive clothes, frequent eating out, drinking at the bar, cable TV, etc.  Which makes it harder for them to enjoy the things that are truly important to them.  \n\nPeople need to realize they'll likely earn millions over the lifetime, and then decide how they really want to spend it.

At that point, it doesn't really matter, because you've already accounted for the most important expense.",

If you truly can't, you can then revisit/adjust the savings goal.  But most Americans have tons in discretionary/flexible expenses.    \n\n\nFor most people, it makes sense to 1) at least max out any 401K employer matching, 2) try to contribute at least $5K-$10K yearly, if possible, to a 401K/IRA, and 3), if possible, max out all 401K/IRA options so you minimize the amount of money confiscated by uncle same.  (Not sure about 401K's, but you can again withdraw from T-IRA's if truly necessary with only a modest penalty, and sometimes none at all.)",

Roth IRA's are more flexible, and may be withdrawn in retirement untaxed, but your income will likely be lower in retirement than it is now, so that's not generally preferable.  And their greater flexibility (ease in early withdrawal without penalty) makes it less likely you'll keep it saved.\n\nNow, you may not get the up-front tax break benefit of a traditional IRA if your income is above a certain limit, and you have a 401K, but you should still be able to make the standard $6.5K contribution.  And have that money grow untaxed once invested within the IRA, which is at least as important.  (Why invest it instead in a standard brokerage account, where all dividends and gains from sales will be taxed?)    \n\n\nNote:  You can still withdraw early from a traditional IRA.  You'll just have to pay a 10% penalty, with the withdrawal also treated as income for income tax purposes that year.  However, you'll probably only do so in a crisis anyway, like extended unemployment, meaning your income (and income tax) will be lower that year anyway.  And you can withdraw penalty-free for things like buying your first home, or your first new home after not owning one for a few years (up to $10K), or for educational/medical expenses for yourself or your family, or in certain emergency economic contexts, like during Covid.  So it's usually a good idea to max out all possible IRA contributions, whether or not you get an up-front tax break.",

If so, you should put as much as possible into legal, government-approved tax shelters like the 401K and IRA, because you'll generally get an up-front tax break as a result, and your money will then grow tax-free.  (That money is also usually protected from creditors, which is an additional bonus.  And it can be withdrawn penalty-free under certain circumstances.  And only incurs an 10% early withdrawal penalty in all other cases, in addition to the income tax on it for that year, which will likely be lower than the year you contributed if you're feeling the need to withdraw it early.)\n\nWhen I say \"as much as possible\", I of course mean after your basis needs are met.  I'm not talking about sacrificing housing or decent groceries.  But you should obviously max out those retirement account contributions before investing in a standard brokerage account, because the retirement investment accounts will grow tax-free (and therefore faster), while the standard brokerage accounts will not.\n\nAt minimum, you should obviously max out any employer-matching limit your 401K (if any) has.  Because that's free money.  But even a basic IRA represents the government matching your contribution at your highest marginal tax rate.  Which is probably 20%-33% if you make good money.   So by not doing so, you're sacrificing that free money.\n\nI respect the right of everyone to do what they want with their own money.  It's just important that everyone understand the tax/creditor/growth benefits of retirement account investing.  And from a financial perspective, contributing to such accounts clearly makes more sense than eating out often, buying new cars, frequent fancy vacations, etc.  (Though one can certainly do all that relatively guilt-free after maxing out their retirement contributions, and purchasing their own home, which is another good way to save.)  \n\nBecause you're sacrificing all that free money from tax breaks and tax-free growth (and possible employer matching funds) if you don't.",

After 30 years of 7% post-inflation compounding returns, you will likely have $1.13 million. 4% of 1.13 million is $45,200. You're biweekly return on investment is $1,738.\n\nThis math works no matter how much you make. 15% pretax savings, invested in high-growth indexes, allows you to stop working after 30 years and maintain roughly the same income. And this doesn't factor in social security.\n\nInvest more, you can stop working a little earlier or with a little more. Invest less and you can stop working later or with less.",

You are really using margin so it\u2019s more akin to cc debt than a car loan/ student debt.\n\nThat being said, the question is kind of null because you generally provide brokerage statements to the bank anyways, which should show your relatively live positions. Not saying you are doing otherwise, but generally try to be upfront with your assets/liabilities when the banks do their DD. You don\u2019t want to give them cause to make your life extra cumbersome, even if you can financially afford it.",

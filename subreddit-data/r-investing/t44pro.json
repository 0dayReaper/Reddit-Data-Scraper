There probably is more, but these are the two that stand out.\n\nLeg one is a mobile laser tank designed to intcept missles and cook electronics. There is an example in the same museum as the last maus in russia.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1K17_Szhatie \n\nLeg 2 is much bigger. Not quite goldeneye, but the soviet designers didn't get the message that the SDI system wasn't quite what Regan said it was.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)\nThose two legs get terrifying when you read about what the permiter system/deadhand was supposed to be paired with what M2/D6, the Yamantau complex, and the alleged Kosvinsky Kamen complex were supposed to be. But due to many reasons, some of which are still haunting russia to this day, they never reached full potential.\n\nTLDR: Soviet Super Space Lasers",

Then the neon is purified in Ukraine. \n\nA similar analogy is with gold. There\u2019s trace amounts of gold in seawater, but you don\u2019t see anyone purifying seawater to extract the gold. Probably the same holds for neon, no one would extract neon from normal air because the concentrations too low. It\u2019s not as simple as \u201cbuild more factories\u201d.",

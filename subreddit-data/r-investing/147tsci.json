Some of my friends are saying go for it but some are saying to pull....   \nWith everything I have been reading there is a lot of news around them but shouldn't this be the time when their shares are cheap to get ahead of the game. Through what I have been seeing in the news looks like these problems are just a bump in the road and they will stick it out in the long run.   \nLooking for some guidance here!",

This perspective on the firms comes from conversations with people who worked there in the past 5 years and have since quitted.\n\nBy sticking to the \"create first and find applications later\" approach (badly summarized by me), cited in many financial and administrative texts, they have been steadily detaching from their regular customer base. They are failing to adapt their prototypes and ideas to the uses their customers are finding for them but can't quite integrate into their process.\n\nI couldn't find sources to back me up, I guess it's not the type of thing people typically tweet about. However, speak to anyone who has tested or used their warehouse or retail solutions, and they'll tell you how the companies fail to adapt to their users, creating the impression that their software and hardware are somewhat clunky.",

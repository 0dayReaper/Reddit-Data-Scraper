    "postText": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of buying ETFs that follow Tbills versus buying directly from Treasury Direct. I understand ETFs have a fee but I\u2019m more concerned with tax implications of dividends from ETFs vs what I get from Treasury Direct? Capital gains tax could be a factor but but we\u2019re talking about fractions of a percent. Any help would be much appreciated. \n\nThanks.",

I think of Treasury Direct as a vehicle for savings and not for investing. \n\nI only use treasuries to generate yield on cash when it's not efficient to use methods like box spreads. If I need shorter term liquidity, I use a prime or government money market. \n\nFor longer duration - my risk tolerance is a bit higher, so I prefer funds that hold more than just treasuries. The expense is worth the additional yield and convenience since I don't know much about fixed income investing. \n\nThere are lots of ways to get exposure to US treasuries. All these methods exist because different people have different needs - Treasury Direct is great for people without a brokerage account. It's just not for me.\n\nBTW - What do you mean by \"taking on some interest rate risk\"? Afaik - interest rate risks exists whether someone uses Treasury Direct, buys treasuries directly, or uses a fund.",

The fund is designed as a 1 - 3 constant duration year treasury fund. \n\nThe fund will have an average yield to maturity and average weighted maturity. \n\nIf you hold the fund to at least the average maturity and reinvest dividends, it will yield the average yield. \n\nThe fund holds underlying bonds at different maturities to adjust and maintain a constant duration.\n\nSo today - if you invest in $VGSH - you can expect that in 2 years that you would have an annual yield of about 4.2% - [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vgsh#portfolio-composition](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vgsh#portfolio-composition) \n\nTreasuries have the same interest rate risk that you describe - if an investor bought a 2 year t-note 2 years ago, they are susceptible to the same rising or falling interest rate risks. You can smooth out the interest rates with a bond ladder - but that's kinda what you get with a constant duration fund.",

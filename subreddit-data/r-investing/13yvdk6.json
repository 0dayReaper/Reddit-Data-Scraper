    "postText": "My wife started a job a few months ago. It\u2019s a small wealth management company. She is not financially savvy. She became eligible for what she was calling a 401k managed by Schwab. After her first couple contributions, we logged on to check on it and it is titled a \u201cpension trust\u201d not a 401k. What is this, and what are the differences over a 401k? What do I need to know?",

I do know this firm ended their pension plan a couple years ago and maybe the name carried over. \n\nWe are able to make investment decisions on Schwab, just like it\u2019s a 401k. \n\nI\u2019ll get her to ask, but I wanted to get some info before",

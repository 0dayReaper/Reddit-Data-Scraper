Today I just received a mail from calsavers about tax form that I been contributing a portion of my paycheck there. They did not send it to me until now and I already submitted my 2022 tax and already max my 6k of that year. What should I do now? And I just check I been contributing my 2023 also. Now I have two roth ira accounts.",

There are rules that allow you to withdraw from a Roth IRA without paying a penalty, as long as you do it within 6 months or so from the tax filing deadline (so, October-ish).

You can be charged the penalty tax on any excess amount for up to six years, beginning with the year when you file the federal income tax return for the year the error occurred.\n\n\nhttps://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/iras/excess-contribution",

    "postText": "It's time for me to cash out my investment of solid 24K gold coins.  Over 20 ounces worth.  Most are one ounce and are American made. Several Canadian made and Chinese made coins too. \n\nI've done some lazy research and do not believe any of these are the famous million dollar coins. \n None are officially graded, though some have unofficial gradings.  Since none of these are officially graded, there is a chance one or several are not solid gold, though they all come from reputable sources so I believe they are all genuine.  They are all in great shape.\n\nI live in Los Angeles and want to exchange these coins for US dollars. I'm not in a rush to sell, and would be happy with a partial sale of the collection as well.",

Do you think I should get all the coins I'd like to sell officially graded before putting them to market?",

Do a quick search and you'll probably find dozens in the greater Los Angeles area.",

They are small time brokers who offer a quick an easy outlet for one to buy or sell what amounts to bullion in one ounce increments. They have to make money somehow so they discount the price they pay relative to the current spot price when they buy and add a bit when they sell. They almost never pay a premium for a coin. They are smart enough to check each coin that comes in to see if it's particularly sought after in the numismatic market before reselling them but other than that they couldn't care less if they're buying a $20 Eagle or a South African Krugerrand.",

At least with other collectibles (e.g. art jewelry, alcoholic beverages) there could be significant appreciation from collector value. Better off buying a couple Rolex Submariners than stacking up $30k of gold coins.\n\nEdit: addendum\n\nAlso, gold is NOT useful in a societal collapse or natural catastrophe type situation. If that\u2019s the scenario you are planning for then spam, rice, and drinking water are king",

Average mortality has gone from 74.75 years in 1988 to 78.75 years in 2016. Adding 3 years changes how that group passes wealth to people less than 50 because median age of birth in 1970 was just over 25 years. A 50 year old in 1988 was more likely to have deceased parents and any inheritance. Due to increased life expectancy inheritance is less likely for people less than 50. It makes me feel like 50 may be a deliberate cutoff point for the comparison because it is the age at which this effect is magnified.\n\nIt also helps that a 70+ age individual experienced the change to the 401K plan as they also had pensions. They also experienced an incredible asset boom that has lasted 40 years (with interruptions). This may be a new normal or an exceptionally lucky aberration for this age group.",

I feel like you may have implied that point but I think it's worth saying explicitly.  \n\nThe fabled promise of significantly longer lifespans/\"living forever\" actually scares me.

Then he inherited $30,000, and today - about thirty years later - his liquid net worth is north of $5,000,000 (using the phrase \"north of\" not to suggest that that's an extravagant amount, but rather because I'm not sure of his actual worth - that's just the amount that was in one of his brokerage accounts that he showed me).   \n\nIn the spirit of the 18-year-old he once was - who got all of his siblings out of an abusive home ruled by an alcoholic prince-of-tides father in rural Florida in the 1950's - he will distribute that fortune among his family and descendants.  When he passes, that money will probably be split among 30-40 of his siblings, cousins, children, grand-children, and some more-distant relatives.  Even a simple average, $5,000,000 / 40, yields $125,000 per person - significantly more than the $75,000 (in today's money) that he received via inheritance from his father-in-law in the mid-late 1980's.\n\nIt really does depend on the person.  While some might spend more (when they live longer), others will amass larger fortunes as they continue to work well beyond the standard age of retirement (as my grandfather continues to do).  Some will invest better than others.  Others will lose large portions of their investments. \n\nIn general, despite potentially lower wealth in today's younger population, quality of life is nevertheless drastically improved vs. prior generations, due to modern medicine, computing, social norms, transportation, food, law enforcement, emergency response times, social connectivity, and general technology.  \n\nEven if I (currently 21 years old) wind up poorer than my predecessors, I still appreciate that - for the large part - I have it better.  If mild economic difficulties are my only struggle, I have it easy.",

Genetics always plays a role but people with money in general are in better health than those without. They can afford better healthcare, they can afford concierge doctors who will spend two hours per appointment with them addressing all their concerns and needs. They don\u2019t delay healthcare due to cost, which in many cases can lead to early decline and death, they are not limited when insurance won\u2019t cover a medication, they have the ability to travel to the best health centers in the country to have the brightest and best minds working on them. There\u2019s no secret that lower income is associated with higher rates of obesity and chronic disease states, many of which can lead to an early death. People with money can afford healthier diets, gym memberships, personal trainers, and a plethora of other health enhancing modalities. \n\nMy point in all of this is that your extended age of 78.5 factors in a lot of lower income, chronically ill people who meet an early demise. Those holding a substantial number of these investable assets are likely outliving those who can\u2019t afford decent healthcare and living into their late 80s to mid 90s delaying the passage of wealth more than estimated.",

Six months is a good safety net, but most people aren't going to be out of work that long.\n\nPersonally I just leave my emergency fund invested in my brokerage account.  If I lose my job and I run out of severance/etc and haven't gotten another job, then maybe I might have to sell some stocks in a down market.  That's basically the worst case, and it isn't that bad.  On the upside that money is all invested all the time and I've yet to lose my job.\n\nNow, if you have a job that is more seasonal/etc then of course you'd want to keep cash to level things out.",

My great grandmother on my moms side ran through roughly $3 million after selling her late husbands farm land by the time she passed at 93. My dads parents lived rather frugally and worked until they were 80. They ran through &gt;$1 million before they passed away at 91 and 89.       \nRest-home visits after major surgery/injury, dementia, cancer, Alzheimer, heart conditions, physical therapy, etc. . . You would be amazed at home much debt the elderly carry for medical bills and some just plain out decided to pass away. The system is made to suck as much wealth away from them as possible.       \nA great example is that my 91 year old grandmother had a stroke and was revived. She suffered brain damage which led to severe and sudden dementia and Alzheimer. After being kicked out of 2 rest homes that were partially covered by her medical insurance for being unruly we had to pay out of pocket for one that dealt with Alzheimer patients specifically; it was $9,000 a month before factoring in medicine and treatment. If you can't afford something like that they put you in the government assisted homes that you read about on the news (sexual assault, neglect, abuse).",

That would be ok even without an inheritance tax, because the money that was accumulated would still be taxed when it's used. As long as the cost basis stays the same, anyway.\n\nBut changes like that are hard to make. The group that it affects the most (older people) has the highest percentage of active voters.\n\nAnd by the time millenials/post-millenials are old enough, they'll also vote to keep their money. It's easy to vote to take someone else's money when you don't have any, but people change their mind pretty quickly when they're the ones with the advantage.",

So together my suspicion is we are comparing two very different size groups when comparing over 50 to under 50 in 1989 to now.\n\nThe poster's title (I believe) wants you to think it's a generational issue (i.e. the baby boomers are hoarding the wealth), but it seems like to me most of it is more likely to be a combination of:\n\n* Older people have had more time to gather wealth\n* Demographics because of the Baby Boomers means there are more older people now than 30 years ago.\n* A change in how people are funding retirement now than 30 years ago.  30 years ago pensions were more common but now we have had decades of 401k so there is more wealth sitting in retiree's retirement fund.  The calculation would have ignored the value of the pension fund but counted 401k wealth.",

Then look at investing in investable assets from 31% to 16% which around 50% less in terms of percentage. Then if we couple it with a change in median income based upon quartiles there's a paper that shows the higher individuals see significantly more growth in wage in some respects 50% or more than lower quartile counterparts and when its percentage in growth someone with 100k can grow significantly faster than someone with 50k if the 3% increase goes to the 50k and 6% increase  to 100k the compounding effect. This doesn't factor in how much excess of disposable income you can reinvest at 100k mark as the standard of living we assume is the same they live in the same area. Then we assume most people in higher-paid positions are much older they will get more return. But the evident factor is this needs to be tied in alongside wage growth which shows younger individuals are paid significantly less in the same portion of there life than these people who currently are older with much more significant asset worth. You cannot catch up plain and simple. Also, in the scenario rent-seeking is a lot more likely which creates another burden on younger individuals.",

That is, people now need to invest and save in the form of a 401K instead of relying on a pension for retirement. If pensions weren\u2019t counted as investable assets but a 401k is then I would think that would make up the bulk of the difference.",

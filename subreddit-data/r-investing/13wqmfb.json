    "postText": "Hello: What is the best way to purchase treasury bonds? Should I go through a broker or buy at treasury direct? I want to purchase short term treasuries with funds I will need in roughly 6 months to a year and avoid as many fees as possible while maintaining easy accessibility of the funds when it matures. I've never used treasury direct so I am not sure how that works.",

They are being weenie snowflakes. The web site is solidly functional and easy to use.\n\nAt TD you can schedule bond purchases long in advance and have them roll over as they mature. The minimum purchase at TD is $100 and $100 increments.\n\nBonds held at TD cannot be redeemed at TD before maturity. To redeem early, they have to be transferred to a broker. The transfer process is tedious, slow, and difficult. Don't buy bonds at TD if you might want to cash out before maturity.\n\nBonds at TD are only available by non-competitive\\* auction. You won't know the yield until the auction is over and you can't cancel the purchase if you don't like the yield.\n\nBuying bonds is easy at brokers. To buy Treasury bonds at non-competitive auction you have to place the buy order between the auction announcement date and the auction date a few days later. Brokers only list T-bonds for ordering between the auction announcement date and the auction date. You have to pay attention to the auction schedule to buy them.\n\n[https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/221/Tentative-Auction-Schedule.pdf](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/221/Tentative-Auction-Schedule.pdf)\n\nAuctioned T-bonds at brokers are $1000 minimum and $1000 increments.\n\nT-bonds at brokers can be sold any time on the secondary market at the market value on the sale date. Depending on what has happened to interest rates since buying the bond that can result in a capital gain or loss. Existing T-bonds can also be bought on the secondary market any trading day.\n\nGetting your money at maturity is easy at either. At TD the money is transferred to the associated bank account on the maturity date. At brokers the money is deposited in your sweep account at the broker.\n\n\\*The competitive auctions are not available to small investors.",

The result of the auction determines the yield. The government can refuse to sell at a yield higher than they will accept. Buyers can refuse to buy at a yield lower than they will accept. Non-competitive purchases get whatever yield the result of the auction is. This is similar to placing a market order for stocks.\n\nLimit orders are not allowed for T-bond purchases by non-competitive auction. You can place limit orders for purchase of existing bonds on the secondary market.\n\nNew bonds are issued at the yield determined by the auction on the discount or premium to par and coupon rate  for the par value at maturity. T-Bills do not have coupon payments. They are always sold at a discount to par. The difference between the discount price and par is the entire yield.\n\nIf you buy a T-Bill with a yield of X% that yield is on the purchase price, not the maturity par value.",

Either way, it\u2019s reasonable to expect that it will be almost the same as the YTM of outstanding bills.\n\nWhen bonds are issued with coupons, such as notes or bonds, the interest rate is typically set at the current market rate so the price comes out to roughly the same as the par value.",

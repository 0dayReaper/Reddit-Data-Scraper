    "postText": "Hello\n\nI am 23 years old ,I put a total of 7K into the brokerage for investing while having saved 26K after moving 7K into the brokerage. I bought 2K worth of VWCE and in a timeframe of 9-10 months 5K worth of BBBY stock\n\nThe stock it went kinda well being up with gains of 300% of my investment(15K+7K my money) but I didn't sold and now am sitting on 300euros and still holding .....my broker Degiro kinda screw me as well as I am not be able to buy VWCE due to KIID regulations \n\n Long story short I have only 2K for investing and any gains that will happen from the stock am holding .\n\nDo you think investing is still worth and that in some point in the future I will be able to break even my losses by just holding VWCE ? \n\nAny advice would be appreciated as I am kinda psychologically down .All these times am kinda trying to not make decisions based on my psychology but here is my plan \n\n1) Hold bbby stock for future ( or till I break even)\n\n2) Invest into VWCE",

The market is not rigged and is not against you. It's not the market's fault that you invested in a bankrupt company against all advise and common sense. If you check your comment history, around September of 2022 i personally warned you that BBBY is going bankrupt but you refused to listen because you thought it's going to squeeze. Needless to say that this is not investing but gambling. The market can be used as a place to grow your money slowly over time or it can be used as a casino and you chose casino.\n\n3. In your place I would sell everything and create a new account in the irish Degiro website (where they still allow you to buy ETFs) or in IBKR and continue investing only in an All World Etf. Your current account not only is useless because you can't buy Etfs but also it gives you depression because you will have to wait 10 years until you see green again and it will constantly remind you of your failure.\n\nMake a fresh start with a new portfolio that isn't -80% and use the lessons you learned. Never buy a single stock again, never fall for hype and unsubscribe from the cultist and gambling subreddits you were taking advise from. Eventually you 'll make your money back, but it's going to take a really long time.",

I moved to Irish Degiro and I keep on buying Vanguard All World as usual, no problems.\nYou can create a new account here \nhttps://www.degiro.ie/\n\n I also created an IBKR account where I verified that I can buy from there too with slightly higher fees but in the end I decided to stay with Degiro  because they are regulated in Germany and I feel my money is safer there.\n\nAnother thing I want to tell you is that until your retirement, you are going to see the markets drop big many times, this is normal and you should expect it, you will even get to see -50%. Markets drop and recover, sometimes it takes many years. When single stocks drop they may never recover again, that's why stocks are not for people like me and you who are clueless, when things will get rough..we will panic..buy high sell low and lose money.\n\nI will also like to share with you a blog that I'm reading that helps me understand how the market works so you can start getting informed responsibly.\n\nhttps://awealthofcommonsense.com/\n\nBecause we are from the same country I feel bad and I'm trying to help, hope you 'll do ok in the future.",

This the distribution ETF, if you want the accumulating one then buy VWCE from the XET exchange and you pay 1 euro again (as long as you buy once per month).\n\nIbkr charges 1.4 euros, slightly higher but the platform is nicer and looks more professional. \n\nI started investing when I was 40, I wish I would have started at your age, even at a loss. You have a great advantage and you should consider yourself lucky that you learned important lessons early in your life. Investing in a total market fund is very slow and requires lots of patience, as humans we are programmed to seek immediate satisfaction and fast results and this is not going to happen. That's why investing although simple is also so difficult and not anyone can do it,  best thing you can do is just DCA and don't think about it alot.\n\nNobody is interested to make money after waiting 20 or 30 years but then eventually they arrive to be 60 years old and wish they had. In the end, time is inevitable and the years will pass despite what we believe about them.",

The reason why it's important to make that clear is because if you can't take responsibility, then trading/investing might not be for you because you will end up losing it all.\n\nIn regards to the rigged... please remember everyone is in the market with the same objective.. to make a profit... it doesn't matter if your trading with  a 100 or a billion the objective is the same...if you remember that as a key point then maybe you will understand why your losing money when you standing in the way of them making money.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with you taking a contrarian position... but before you do that, you need to get used to market movement and ranges of the stock your planning on dealing with...\n\n jumping in straight because of buzz words like \"gme\" \"squeeze\" \"kill da shorts\" \"evil corporates\" etc... is pretty much a recipe for death... also the narrative that all those funds are evil is just that a narrative..",

Every single thing that you have stated is either untrue or misinterpreted.\n\nYou have already received a lot of feedback on your post from people who have a lot more experience and knowledge. Yet you prefer to believe the false information being perpetuated by a cult.  \n\nIf you really want to learn how to invest and understand the capital markets then the first step is to accept that you are the one that was manipulated into buying stock in a failing company. \n\nBBBYQ is the new age attempt at a pump and dump using social media misinformation. That's why it's called a meme stock. \n\nAbout some of your misperceptions:\n\nThe Reg SHO list occurs when a stock is very volatile and heavily shorted. Yes - delivery must occur. And that is what happens. You are misintepreting why a stock stays on that list. In a stock like BBBY - traders (both retail and prop) are day and swing trading and shorting the tops. It doesn't mean that the short share are not being delivered - Traders short usually for short periods of time to lock in gains and do it again over and over. There are plenty of retail traders who are simply more experienced and knowledgeable than you are that are profiting from BBBY's failure by shorting.\n\nYour broker didn't stop trading in BBBY without warning. Did you read and understand the disclosures from your broker? Many brokers like Degiro do not support OTC penny stocks - this is not new process. When a stock is delisted - many brokers will only allow liquidation. Your broker is literally trying to protect you as required by law from doing more damage to your finances. \n\nThe increase in float was not a surprise - it was actually announced by the company in advance. In order to attempt to save the company, BBBY put together a death-spiral financing as a last ditch effort to generate liquidity. This was very clearly mentioned in the regulatory filings months ago. \n\nWhat happened to you is terrible and I am sorry that you fell victim to the meme stock cults. But your first step is to get out of the cult if you want to help yourself.",

I haven't looked at BBBY and so I can't comment on what the DTCC commentary is... however I would suspect that the information is widely discussed on some kinda bbbystock sub-reddit... and another popular thread will be evil shorts...  \n\nMy first rule of investing and trading is avoid those threads like the plague... 99% of the time those threads are only active because of bagholding and everyone goes into some wild group delusion of persecution and start creating reasons for why they are screwed... but most of the time it has nothing to do with the business but how its preventing a squeeze/rally... which then leads to the next post \"shorts must die\"... its pure emotion in those threads with close to zero logic.\n\nThe second issue of broker... I guess degiro is a discount broker and its common that they don't allow the trading of penny stock OTC... its in the terms and conditions when you opened the account... so its not like you can say its a surprise they don't allow trades... you need something like IBKR for that... (did you check if degiro will allow you to sell the shares to close position?)\n\nAs for the third... no, you can't easily win this game because it's not a game... the statistics are very real... 90% of people  got washed out of the market. The only ones who succeed are those who take it seriously... almost anyone who made a crap ton of money in a single trade with some random gamble usually returned the money back to the market with interest inside of a year...",

In the last 6 months - the liquidity issue that the company faced was pretty clear that the company would be at risk of bankruptcy.\n\nNow that BBBY has failed and are liquidating store - it's quite likely that the company will just try to sell off assets to pay creditors. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the reorg plan will result in all the shares being cancelled.",

I also invest about 10-15% into an international fund.\n\nThese are base levels. From there, you can choose to invest into specific sectors or dividend growth funds. I stay away from random company individual funds. I do invest a bit into individual stocks, but it's only companies who have been around for a decently long time, and again, NOTHING that's doing so poorly that they've announced bankruptcy, or are super low cost (down in the &lt; $5 range.)\n\nGood luck.",

            "comment": "When you purchase individual stocks, the idea that the price will go up if you hold it long enough doesn\u2019t apply. Companies fail (FRC), or they get bought out, or they just slowly go from really great to out of touch with the current environment (GE, Blackberry). Markets trend up over long periods because for every individual company that fails, is kicked out, or trending down, another individual company takes its place. Investing is mostly focused on statistical probability that the invested money will yield something over the long term with minimal risk. Where as the markets will look at BBBY, GME, FRC, etc and just move on replacing their value with others, when you purchase individual stocks you are taking a considerable risk equal to your investment amount. In other words, each individual company you purchase stock in can go to zero. It\u2019s not easy to watch hard earned money go away. It is a bad habit to leave losses in and use hope that the company will magically turn around. You may need some personal discipline in cutting your losses, and invest what you have left, be it even 300 euro in something stable that will grow long term like a general market ETF.\n\nOn the other hand, a lot of people play the lottery. Even knowing the odds are astronomically small, they still purchase dozens of lottery tickets. Each ticket that is not a winner is a loss just like bad stocks. Choosing to jump on the bandwagon of failing companies thinking that one or a group of unorganized folks can overcome the discipline, research, tools, and experience of large corporate short sellers and large trading firms to \u201csqueeze\u201d them is no different than thinking your lottery ticket is the winner, so you buy 100 of them or 4000 of them.\n\nSo how do you deal with the emotional difficulty of seeing your account 60% in the hole knowing the majority company is in bankruptcy? You sell for what you can right now. You do it fast, like ripping off a bandaid. Learn that the stock market is an exchange of money so it\u2019s more prudent to invest than to try and catch large institutions in squeezes. Put whatever money you get back into something prudent, usually not on the latest bandwagon.\n\nAlternatively, you accept to yourself that you want to gamble and try to outsmart the markets so acknowledge the risk you take and put in only what you are comfortable losing because chances are you will lose it all. You then mitigate your personal loss risk with self imposed selling short stops like 3% or whatever you want but also, most importantly, gain limits. Take the money instead of letting it stay. Don\u2019t worry that the stock still has room to grow or whatever. You\u2019re in the gambling to make money. Take the profit or loss and repeat the emotional cycle.\n\nWhen I first started buying stocks in 2018 I made similar mistakes. But I sucked it up, sold my losses and bought more stable companies. I tried the GME and BBBY bandwagons but with small percentage of my account\u2019s value and ended up in losses for both. I sold, learned my lesson that I am bad at gambling, and bought some SPY. I saw my account go heavily negative due to COVID but because I was in SPY and some individual companies making up the top 20-30 profitable US companies I knew that they would recover or the world would be so bad that money would be worthless. That was the only time I let it ride and even bought a little on the way down.",

            "comment": "The first way you cope is by learning from the BBBY buy. Reflect on what happened and don't fall for a pump and dump again. You're young, and it wasn't all of your money. Eventually, if you keep working and advancing your occupation, 7k won't feel like all that much.\n\nI primarily invest my money, but I trade with about 5% of it. I've had trades that returned almost 3000% and I've had ones that lost me 90%. I dealt with the losses by learning, and developing strategies to avoid the next loss.\n\nDid the big losses hurt? Absolutely, and I was a bit freaked out at first. But I changed things up and considered it an expensive lesson. Finding blame might make you feel better in the short term, but taking responsibility and identifying what you did wrong will benifit you in the long run.\n\nAlso, read some books. I suggest you start with \"A Random Walk Down Wallstreet.\" You'll find a lot of useful info and perspective there, and also that the BBBY thig is not a new phenomenon in the market.",

The fact that you\u2019ve held through losses is a valuable lesson, many people realize losses and never come back. Tell yourself that next time you\u2019ll go into investing with a bit more knowledge and will make (or at least try to make) better decisions. Many people never get in the market or invest at 23 years old. You\u2019re still ahead of the curve and have a long time to invest. Stay at it, be aggressive and smart as you still have 50 years to invest. Losses can also off-set taxes on future gains.",

That's literally the reason.\n\nThe only reason to *hold* is that you're such a child mentally, you would rather spend 300 to avoid admitting it's over.\n\nGood luck out there champ, you're gonna need it.

Feel free to post here! \n\nIf your question is \"I have $10,000, what do I do?\" or other \"advice for my personal situation\" questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:\n\n* How old are you? What country do you live in?  \n* Are you employed/making income? How much?  \n* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)  \n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  \n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  \n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)  \n* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?  \n* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.  \n\nPlease consider consulting our FAQ first - https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/faq\nAnd our [side bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/about/sidebar) also has useful resources.  \n\nIf you are new to investing - please refer to Wiki - [Getting Started](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/gettingstarted/)\n\nThe reading list in the wiki has a list of books ranging from light reading to advanced topics depending on your knowledge level.

Does the bank transfer the interest earned monthly to your checking account for you to use or is it tied up until it matures.\n\nI want to be able to keep my principal invested but live off the monthly interest for the next year. Is that possible?",

Do I put towards VTSAX each month? \n\nFirst of all, make sure you understand the difference between an **account** and a **fund**.  Your employer 401(k) is an account.  An **I**ndividual **R**etirement **A**ccount is obviously an account.  -Within- an account, you buy stuff -- things like funds.\n\nAnd, you can't buy a **fund** outside of an **account** -- you have to have a \"container\" for your purchase.\n\nSo, which account?\n\nI'll couch my answer as follows: the year is less than half over.  How much MORE do you think you can contribute to your retirement in the next seven months?\n\nIf you think you can only contribute $6500 more, you can put it in either Account -- add to your employer plan, or open an individual account.  BUT, that's the limit for IRAs.\n\nIf you think you can contribute more than $6500 -- maybe *much* more -- then you should increase to your employer plan; the contribution limit there is $22.5K.  \n\nIf your employer plan doesn't offer VTSAX specifically, they certainly will offer an equivalent -- it's a Total Market index tracker, and *everybody and his dog* has one.",

A lot of people spend whatever they have available.  \n\nGeneral recommendation is to save at least 15% of your income including match. If you can save more, that'll set you up for an earlier and/or more comfortable retirement. If you can't save that much, do your best and set a schedule to increase savings a little bit each year and/or raise.  \n\nYou can save in any of the above. If your 401k has bad fund options, then go with an IRA/Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are also more flexible because you can withdraw principal with no tax or penalty at any time (and has higher income limits than traditional IRAs and doesn't interfere with backdoor conversions if you get above that limit in the future).  \n\nOpen a regular (taxable) account if you want to save and invest money for goals earlier than retirement.",

I am not putting any of these in ETFs (enough of 401K in VTI and rest in VOO). I have a principle of buying 1 VOO every month and I will continue to do it. What are some of the stocks that you can suggest that I should do my due diligence on? I am staying away from the NVDA or random AI companies train and also the tech stock train (I already have some MSFT, AAPL, META, GOOG, AMZN all in profit since I buy and hold for long time). Suggestions welcome what sectors/tickers I should explore?",

My primary advice would be that I think you have enough assets that you should consider one of the low cost advisors (like Wealthfront or Vanguard Advisors) and have them set something up for you.  They'll likely put you into something like a 60/40 mix (stocks/bonds) and can help you keep track of everything.  Since you say you're not too savvy and need guidance that's what I think would help you the most and give you peace of mind.  The second piece of non-financial advice would be to take some of that surplus interest income / dividends off the windfall and invest in yourself/education/training for whatever career direction you pursue.

I'd suggest allocating more and more to a diversified pool of ETFs ensuring it's truly diversified of course (sectors, geography, asset classes). I would not go in all at once, instead, build your exposure by averaging in i.e., monthly investments or other frequency. Of course, get an understanding of the inherent volatility with each investment and the relationship between them, and build a portfolio with a risk profile that you could tolerate.",

Barclays ISA offer 0.7%. Not sure if I'm mixing up 2 different stats there. \n\nOnce I've got an emergency fund set up id love a Roth IRA type deal to put my excess towards.\n\nThanks in advance for any tips",

I have a few questions that might be a bit silly to ask.\n\nFor the past two years I was earning $70k as a single unmarried filer and contributed to a ROTH IRA. Early this year, I doubled my income and now earn $147k and now file as a head of house hold (one daughter). \n\nMy first question is, in order for me to contribute the max amount of $6,500, do I have to open a traditional account and convert it to a backdoor IRA? If so, do I have to do this every year? OR, since I already have a ROTH IRA account am I \"grandfathered in\" where I can contribute the maximum amount despite earning more? Or can I only contribute at the adjusted amount of $2,600?",

Like I said earlier, start small and invest more over time, as this would be my first time investing.\n\n* Risk Tolerance: Really not looking to possibly get hurt here. I am not looking to day trade to gamble a few thousand into something else.\n\n* No current holdings, this is absolutely my first time investing. Very new to it all.\n\n* No big debts, no large expenses\n\nBasically just trying to get my foot in the door with a long term hold into big tech and to learn a few things along the way.

He has great advice on how to control spending and if you have trouble living inside your means he offers ok advice but I wouldn't take his advice on investing\n\nI have heard dave Ramsey claim mutual funds will return 11% and this is a somewhat broad over optimistic statement, and its really closer to 9%. He from my understanding has not named these funds that return 11%.\n\nHe also has a weird thing about index funds, he called Jack Boggle a communist what annoys me. Jack boggle wasn't a communist at all. It just bothers me when people say \"Anything I don't like is communism\"; Saying shit like that actually dismisses the actual horror of real communism .",

So he doesn't name the funds he just says \"Well go on our website and we can hook you up with one of our trusted investment advisors\"\n\nNow I am not against using an investment advisor ; but I think for a lot of people its not really needed. If you just want to stash away 6k year in an Roth IRA to save up for retirement well an investment advisor might not offer that much value, its pretty easy just to setup an account with vangaurd /schwab/fidelity and buy broad based index funds.\n\nI am skeptical of his 11% returns, and I am not sure if those 11% returns are net of fees, sure if a fund returns 11%, but the fees are 2% the real returns are 9% what is in line with most broad market index funds.\n\nAlso sometimes his math is just wrong because he doesn't take into effect of compounding\n\nMeaning you invest 10k, you get 10% returns. After 10 years you won't have 20k you will have more due to compounding you will have like 26K . I have heard him on the show try to claim this is like a 15% average return. Its not its 10% yearly . Meaning lots of his math is just wrong or he doesn't take compounding into account when giving these returns\n\nedit\n\nI am not anti dave ramsey , however he offers dumb down advice for people who have made poor financial decisions so at some point you have to sort of do this because lets face it some of the average people may not understand compound growth or the pretty simple math behind it\n\nSo he will say things like \"If you get 10% returns your money will double in 10 years\" well thats not true it will more than double in 10 years because of compounding",

Compound growth seems to be the line that divides the financially literate from the illiterate, you'd think Dave Ramsey of all people would know that stuff cold.\n\nTo double your money in 10 years, you only need growth of 7.2%, while at 10%, your money will double every 7.2 years (rule of 72).\n\n&gt; Well one thing to remember as part of Dave's business he has affiliated investment advisors. So he wants to drive people to use his investment advisors. So he doesn't name the funds he just says \"Well go on our website and we can hook you up with one of our trusted investment advisors\"\n\nSome reporter tried that and the advisor recommended a target date fund, not a mutual fund returning 14%.\n\nI believe many people who are basically financially illiterate will do best to have a financial advisor, and that's kind of ridiculous. Those with the basic ability to shovel money into an index fund every month until they retire, and not panic when President Crankypants spooks the market or whatever, will outperform the vast majority of financial advisors and mutual funds alike.\n\nPeople don't realize the power of 1%. Over 50 years, reducing your growth rate by 1% results in a final value that's 33% smaller. Over the same period, a financial advisor that charges 1% and who sticks you in a mutual fund that _also_ charges 1% and which underperforms the market average by 0.5% will net you less than half what you would have made if you just invested in a market-average index fund.\n\nWhen you realize this, and you consider how much Dave trashes index funds and Jack Bogle, it _really_ destroys his credibility IMO.",

He went on to list his returns, not the fund names, but the returns of the funds since inception.  People were able to extrapolate that they were various American Fund products.   most of them were around 13% since inception.  THE ISSUE.   since that video 6 years ago, those product now have inception returns of less than 12%.  which means that in under 6 years, they returns have been poor enough to drop 50 to almost 90 years worth of returns to get to sub 12%.  which is impressive.  \n\nSo now Dave is saying 10% and pretending like he's said that the entire time!  \n\nhere is also the rub with the \"supposed\" funds.  They have returned less than 10% since 2007ish.  thats over 15 years of sub 10% avg returns.",

This requires some investment of profits. \n- inflation \n\nAnd then the big wildcard\n\n- changes in valuation multiples.  That one is the wildcard because it's sort of maybe not an ever improving metric, but can improve for decades then reverse.  \n\nSome of the gains in stock markets over the past few decades have been a response to dropping interest rates. That not only allows companies to borrow more easily, it means investors will accept a lower future return on stocks since they are looking for a spread over bonds and bonds are yielding less.  Accepting a lower future return means bidding up the price now.  Additionally we've had a regime of boomers going to retirement pouring assets into financial markets.  What happens to multiples over the next decade or two as boomers draw down capital and interest rates are probably a different regime from the last 2 decades?\n\nBig questions.",

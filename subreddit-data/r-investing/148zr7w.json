    "postText": "Okay, calm down I\u2019m not actually asking this question. It was a joke written by an investor below an Instagram meme.\n\nIt was a thought provoking joke to me though and I would very much enjoy it if some of you took their time to read this and give their thoughts on it. \nMy response went as follows:\n\nWhile I understand the humor in your comment It's quite intriguing to ponder the potential impact that such a decision could have on someone's life. I highly doubt anyone would be foolish enough to go all-in on a single warrant, penny stock or crypto currency. Besides, here in Germany, regulation wouldn't even allow it for the most part.(scandals like Wirecard and loosely regulated assets like crypto are a whole different topic) However even in a first world country like the United States speculating with all your money in one sketchy asset isn\u2018t something impossible at all. Crazy to think one could lose their entire pension through one unthoughtful, rushed financial decision. I guess they call it the \u201cland of endless possibilities\u201c instead of \u201cland of endless opportunity\u201c here for a reason.\n\nAs a European, I have grown up in a pension system in which everyone is legally required to pay a monthly cut of their wage into a pool which is then payed out to you proportionally when you retire at earliest 67. There is more expensive private pensions with other investment assets, earlier pension without financial disadvantages and a whole lot of other benefits as well, but generally everyone has to pay into their pension when they work. I can\u2019t explain this whole topic entirely because it would go beyond the scope this thread (and I\u2019m also only studying finance in the second semester haha) but I think you get the gist. \nBased on this system which some of you might call a privilege and others a bottleneck my opinion on financial assets leans slightly more to a more pro regulatory attitude on the US finance market.\n\nMy questions now for people within and outside of the US are:\n\n1: Which pension system/ country are you accustomed to and what you would prefer for yourself/ your family?\n\n2: I have talked a lot about pension towards the end of my text. Anyways, this whole post stems from the question of wether you would like less regulation on your financial market for the average consumer, sacrificing possible profits, or have a more robust policy for the lower income investor, thus minimizing risk.  \nDo you want stricter or looser rules on the market (especially for lower income and less financially experienced people)? \n\nI know I might have hit a nerve here since most Americans have a very liberal none regulatory attitude, especially when it comes to the economy but I hope I still get some differentiated opinions other than \u201cWell, it\u2019s their own fault if they put all their money into some shitcoin!\u201d This is actually very ironic since I would be considered a very economically liberal person for German standards thinking that some of the financial rules are ridiculously strict here, although I find our system as a whole better. \n\nCan\u2019t wait to hear your takes, seeing you read it all :)\n\n\n\nTl ;dr: In my opinion the financial market shouldn\u2019t be an easily accessible casino. Simple minded, lower/middle class people could think that with 5 minutes of \u201cresearch\u201d they would know, \u201cwether a stock is gonna go up, down sideways or in fucking circles\u201d even though nobody, ever, truly knows since theres factors not even the greatest investors have influence over. The stock market was invented for investing, not horse race betting. What is your opinion?",

People don't:\n\n&gt;lose their entire pension through one unthoughtful, rushed financial decision\n\nSocial Security is not meant to be the sole source of income in retirement. Private pensions aren't a common as they were in the past. They are being replaced in large part by other retirement plans like the IRA, 401k, Roth IRA, etc. People also hold savings in banks, investment companies, brokerage accounts, etc.\n\nIt is possible for people in the US to make investment mistakes or to become victims of fraud. Isn't that possible in Germany?",

This is now roughly 30% of my accumulated public pension capital (despite \"average\" returns)...it might be 50% by the time I retire...\n\nthe alternative cost is real...\n\nI think your post and the text about low income people comes off as pretty condescending...\n\nI think you should compare the returns from going \"all in\" on GME/Wirecard/AMC to the returns from gambling, not investing, and then the alternative is worse...and those bets were taken with savings, not pensions(?), so I don't see the problem...but what do I know?",

    "postText": "For anyone else using TD Ameritrade or Schwab, is there any reason why the 13-week and 26-week Treasury bills were not available today? They are normally available via auction on Thursdays, and [it looks like they were indeed announced as usual today at Treasury Direct](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/auctions/upcoming/).\n\nOr is there a delay due to the Memorial Day holiday?",

Are you saying they weren't there earlier today?\n\nIs there a particular reason why you needed to access them earlier?  The auctions aren't until Monday, and you can place an order at any time until a few hours before the auction.\n\nEdit: Oh, I see that Treasury actually hasn't made an official announcement for the auction yet.  I think this could be related to the debt ceiling thing.  The announcement date of 06/01/2023 is when they would have planned to announce it according to the normal schedule, but given current events, Treasury may have decided to delay the announcement.",

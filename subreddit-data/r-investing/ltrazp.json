It now trades at about the same as carrying value as of Friday.",

Here's what he had to say when they [first issued](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/109694/0000898430-96-001695.txt) b shares, you don't hear many CEOs speak like that (1996) :\n\n&gt;WARREN BUFFETT, AS BERKSHIRE'S CHAIRMAN, AND CHARLES MUNGER, AS BERKSHIRE'S VICE CHAIRMAN, WANT YOU TO KNOW THE FOLLOWING (AND URGE YOU TO IGNORE ANYONE TELLING YOU THAT THESE STATEMENTS ARE \"BOILERPLATE\" OR UNIMPORTANT):     \n&gt;  \n&gt;1. Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger believe that Berkshire's Class A Common Stock is    not undervalued at the market price stated above. Neither Mr. Buffett nor    Mr. Munger would currently buy Berkshire shares at that price, nor would    they recommend that their families or friends do so.     \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. Berkshire's historical rate of growth in per-share book value is NOT    indicative of possible future growth. Because of the large size of    Berkshire's capital base (approximately $17 billion at December 31, 1995),    Berkshire's book value per share cannot increase in the future at a rate    even close to its past rate.     \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. In recent years the market price of Berkshire shares has increased at a rate    exceeding the growth in per-share intrinsic value. Market overperformance of    that kind cannot persist indefinitely. Inevitably, there will also occur    periods of underperformance, perhaps substantial in degree.     \n&gt;  \n&gt;4. Berkshire has attempted to assess the current demand for Class B shares and    has tailored the size of this offering to fully satisfy that demand.    Therefore, buyers hoping to capture quick profits are almost certain to be    disappointed. Shares should be purchased only by investors who expect to    remain holders for many years.",

In terms of shareholder return when he bought Chevron Exxon was also super low and at that price just the dividend which Exxon has been clear throughout that it wouldn\u2019t cut was something like 8 percent. Just the dividend would have returned more then the 5 percent gain to shareholders that was created via share buyback. And we are talking about a stock that was down over 50 percent from its pre pandemic high. To me there are still amazing deals to be had in the oil space even now. BP has went up a good bit in the last several weeks but I still think it\u2019s one of the easiest buys out there in terms of value.",

None of which is actually bad for oil in the near and medium term. Tighter regulation and controls on drilling just constrains supply which keeps oil prices higher. More lenders not wanting to fund oil projects makes capitol harder to acquire and limits new players to the field which also helps keep oil high. \n\nLong term green is the future, but I think the market has oil completely wrong, and is going to be shocked at the demand level once summer hits and case loads drop even in countries that aren\u2019t fully vaccinated.",

What you should expect per them is the returns of a slightly above average company that has (as close to as you can to) no risk of going bust. It's the forward looking risk adjusted returns that may induce boners not the plain return.",

Once summer ends, I don't want to continue selling lemonade, so I perform a share buyback, buying all 100 shares at $2 each.  No dividends were paid in this scenario.  The only way investors realized gains is by selling them at the end of the summer.  \n\nBut at the end of the summer, after making a killing in sales, wasn't the lemonade stand more valuable than at the beginning?  If so, what was the fundamental value of a share?  Was this whole lemonade stand a confidence trick? \n\nNow imagine that I don't really want to completely stop selling lemonade, but I do want to do some buybacks...maybe only 5 shares at $2 each.  Each person who sold gets 100% gains.  Each person who keeps their shares now owns roughly 5% more of the company.  This is like what Berkshire Hathaway has done.",

    "postText": "At the moment the VIX is historically very low. I has been even lower but that was mostly in low interest rate environment or the economy was growing. \n\nWhat is the best way to \"buy\" the VIX index? maybe some ETF that reflects the exact value of VIX? I have seen VXX ETF but it does not adequately track the vix index.\n\nPlease share any ideas.",

            "comment": "VIX index is just a math calculation and there is really no way to buy a math calculation . So traders will make bets with each other on where the calculation will be at in the future and these are just two counter parties basically making a bet with each other and these are just vix futures .\n\nWith these futures contracts the people buying are basically buying insurance , the people selling are selling insurance (in a way) , meaning the people selling will add a price premium to this. No one sells insurance for free.\n\nSo now ETFs can hold these futures contracts but due to the price premium over the long run if volatility stays pretty flat or increases slowly these contracts will lose money due to the premiums , there is really no way around this. They will always sort of lose money in the long run and decay athough they may spike up every now and then along the way then start to decay again.\n\nIn fact for years taking the other side of the bet made money. There was short vix ETF (XIV) and every year it basically just printed money due to the fact it was selling the \"insurance\", every year had amazing returns, until it didn't. Volatility spiked in 2018 and the entire fund collapsed losing like 90% I think in a single day.\n\nEdit technically they are ETNs not ETFs",

And buying is a dumb idea too (as options will sooner or later expire worthless)\n\nIn other words, it may be a bad Idea to deal with VIX at all.",

What was so good about that investment strategy was that you could go long volatility and make more money then S&amp;P500 as the market went up unless the ETF lost 90% of its total value in one day which was mathematical impossible in theory + that it had survived the 2008 crash but offcouse it happened anyway and the ETF fund had to close down.\n\nThe meltdown of that subreddit was epic, i remember  that someone posted a screenshot of a 4 million margin call.\n\nEdit this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/tradeXIV/comments/7vi6oa/xiv_after_hours/",

Like three times it says long term you can expect the returns to be zero.\n\nThen when that happened people were like \"How could this actually happen?\"",

Alternatively, there are VIX contracts constructed in a manner where you can buy as shares such as VIXY or VXX.\n\nHowever, the more suitable play is to buy long dated index puts. As we've lately seen market breadth suffer or imbalanced (XLK +8.97% while the rest returned negative), there is greater opportunity to short QQQ or XLK.\n\nA better trade is to observe sector rotation and take advantage of them by going long on beaten down sectors like energy and utilities (e.g., XLE, XLU).\n\nFinally, while TLT was strongly correlated to indices last year, it's now acting on its own as a flight-to-safety play. If you believe the Fed Fund Rates forecast to be true where we start seeing rates get cut slowly before the end of the year, then TLT or other bond ETFs can be your best bet.\n\nAs always, be reasonable with your portfolio hedge sizes. The market is more irrational than you can be solvent.",

I've had some limited success buying into the vix at lowish points -- I usually work out some sort of \"floor\" price for the trading period. Then get some VIXM -- the short term stuff is too spiky for my tastes. I set a cascading series of auto-sales orders and let it ride until something happens and the VIX spikes. Collect the money, wait until everyone remembers the world is not going to end and repeat.\n\nAgain -- not the greatest of strategies, especially alone.

The VIX itself isn't tradeable. The options and futures are. The options are not tied directly to the futures, but they are priced based on the futures.\n\nThe problem with betting on a rise in VIX is simple: the futures are almost always higher than VIX itself. The lower VIX goes, the bigger the gap. Right now the future expiring in the middle of this month is higher by almost exactly 2 and a half points. The one expiring in the middle of July is higher by more than four points. This is what makes betting on a rise a very iffy proposition.\n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying don't do it. It won't work the way you think it should. Betting on long VIX isn't a speculation: it's disaster insurance. It works very well for that.

Mainly, I used VIX as a gauge when it's time to buy vs sell premium.  But, none of this is really investing.",

They have an advantage that they are not fully invested, so they can adjust daily the money that is at risk, to avoid going to zero. But they still suffer from the contango effect that drags down the price.\n\nTL;DR: you should only buy VIX when you feel it's going to spike (to maximize profit). It usually gives a \"warning\" 1-3 days in advance.",

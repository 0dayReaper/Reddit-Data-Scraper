    "postText": "Buying a property on VA assumption. I am acquiring funds for a second position to pay some of the difference in principal balance and purchase price. Interest rate on the second mortgage will be somewhere in the range of 8-10% to start (may adjust down as market does). \n\nIn 5 years time, a property I have seller financed will be paid out in lump sum resulting in enough to easily pay off the second mortgage. In the meantime, I do get monthly payments from the new buyer.\n\nIs there any reason I shouldn't add to the snowball and continue to contribute the payments I receive on the seller finance to focus on adding to the taxable brokerage account OVER knocking down the second mortgage? \n\nIn the short term, yes they are at 8-10% interest, but in the long run that is another 5 years of added money to that retirement snowball that will eventually be unstoppable?",

I suppose I just see it as it\u2019ll be paid off in 5 years and if I look in that 10-15 year horizon all of those investment contributions will be quite large in comparison to paying off that loan. Same concept at 20,25 year and it just gets better. Maybe I\u2019m accepting too much risk thinking that way though.",

My main contemplation is over the next 5 years of addition adding to the taxable brokerage can really increase the size of that snowball versus just having less on the second. Yes, payments towards that 8-10% interest is great, but take that time horizon out to 10,15,20 years and those years of adding will vastly outgrow just paying that principal down?",

Feel free to post here! \n\nIf your question is \"I have $10,000, what do I do?\" or other \"advice for my personal situation\" questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:\n\n* How old are you? What country do you live in?  \n* Are you employed/making income? How much?  \n* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)  \n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  \n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  \n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)  \n* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?  \n* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.  \n\nPlease consider consulting our FAQ first - https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/faq\nAnd our [side bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/about/sidebar) also has useful resources.  \n\nIf you are new to investing - please refer to Wiki - [Getting Started](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/gettingstarted/)\n\nThe reading list in the wiki has a list of books ranging from light reading to advanced topics depending on your knowledge level.

I don\u2019t really wanna use fidelity for that because it\u2019s kinda complicated UI and confusing. I used to use robinhood 2 years ago until I heard what happened but I do like how easy it is and Ui it looks. I found an different app called moomoo. Does anyone here uses moomoo? I like how simple it looks.",

And they don't provide access to many investment products. Most people will eventually outgrow their services so you are probably better off just using Fidelity if you already have an account. \n\nMoomoo is an even newer broker-dealer and likely has even less features and services.",

Do you have any other propositions to reach the same effect ?\n\nTy",

            "comment": "You can buy a put option. Currently a put on SPY with a strike price of $420, expiring in June 2024, costs about $26.\n\nIn other words, you can pay \u2018insurance\u2019 of $26 per share that will prevent you from losing any more than that. You\u2019ll survive any crash, but you\u2019re losing that $26 no matter what.\n\nFor most investors this is neither wise nor necessary. If you have a long term outlook, just ride the ups and downs. If you have a medium term outlook, balance your stocks with some bonds to stabilize returns. If you have a short term outlook, get the heck out of the market.",

It kinda depends on what you want to do. \n\nIf your investment thesis is that the S&amp;P index will mostly stay flat and you want to \"lock in\" a range, an option collar can be used. Ie. you write call contracts and you use the proceeds to fund long put contracts.\n\nIf you simply want to protect on downside, you can buy protective put contracts against your position.\n\nThe choice of contracts will depend on the underlying S&amp;P index fund that you hold. The number of contracts depend on the number of shares of the underlying fund that you hold. \n\nFor a long term investor - these techniques will generally create drag on your portfolio. And generally not useful unless you have experience with options and/or you have capital preservation financial needs.",

Because it's simulating a short synthetic short, it's not considered a constructive sale by the IRS. \n\nThere are a lot more techniques that you can use for either hedging, income generation, or accumulation. \n\nAnother more advanced hedging technique is to write only calls to reduce the overall delta exposure on the underlying long position. It requires options approval to write naked calls.  But it's not really the kind of technique you use if you are unfamiliar with options. And it requires very active management. Generally only works well with larger underlying positions.",

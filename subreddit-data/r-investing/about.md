Rules:

No low effort posts: **Share investment ideas and insights or ask thoughtful questions**. Please refrain from posting generic news items.  We are not a financial news monitoring subreddit so a regurgitation of a news article without context may be removed. Additional guidelines can be found in the wiki here - https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/rules

Do not make posts looking for advice about your personal situation.: If your question likely has a "right answer",  a beginner topic, you simply need help finding general investing information, or if it's asking for general input on what to do with your investments then post in the "Daily Advice and Discussion Thread" here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/about/sticky?num=1

Keep discussions civil, informative and polite.: **Off topic comments, attacks or insults will not be tolerated.** We recognize that this forum will generate differences of opinion, or misunderstandings of facts, and therefore arguments are expected. However, personal attacks, insults, trolling, or accounts dedicated to getting under the skin of others is not allowed, and will be banned.

Strictly no (self-)promotion or solicitation threads: **Violating this rule results in an automatic permanent ban. Do not post your youtube, twitter, discord, app, tool, blog, referral code, event, survey, etc.** We generally expect that people who come here are not using the forum to build a brand, generate clicks, or shill. Posts that are strictly self-interested or intended to "build awareness" are not acceptable.

Effort: Posts must meet standards of effort: Do not post just an article, highlight the parts of the article you find relevant or offer some commentary surrounding the article.

Additionally do not just make a self post to offer some simple thoughts.  "now is the time to buy", "here's my thoughts", etc. belong as comments to existing posts.  Making your own post devoid of in depth examination will likely result in it being removed.

Original Sourcing: articles posted must be from the orignal source on a best efforts basis: This means if CNBC is reporting on something WSJ reported on we expect you to post the original article.  If anyone is writing an article based on a Bank/investment group news release/white paper post the actual paper and not journalism surrounding it.  

Provide the link to the source article or paper.

This rule will be more strictly enforced based on how clickbaity an article is.

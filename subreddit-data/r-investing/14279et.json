    "postText": "Hi,\nI am a 40 yo male married with 2 kids Currently working. Have a little 401K (~25K) in my current employer. Started a traditional IRA last year and contributed max (6K) each for me and my wife. Wife is working as well. Annual income 280K. \nI will be leaving my job by 3rd quarter of this year to stay home with the kids and will be going back to school. as the wife will have better opportunity. We are still Still looking at 280K salary for 2023-2025. And once I finished school, we\u2019ll probably be at 400-450K annual income. \n\nQuestion:\n1. Should I move my 401K to the same IRA so I can invest it myself? My 401K is currently at about +12% ROI. \n\n2. If I move my 401k to IRA is there a limit of how much I can move? Or can I move the whole 25K then contribute another 6K for this year in either traditional or Roth IRA? \n\n3. With our future salary increase, is it much feasible to convert the 401K to Roth or Traditional?\n\nThanks in advance for any feedback. \nCheers",

Traditional IRA contributions are no longer useful for people in this situation, so they perform a \u201cbackdoor Roth\u201d contribution to avoid the income limits on Roth contributions.\n\nMoving your traditional 401(k) balance to a traditional IRA would hinder any backdoor Roth contributions. You may want to move that balance to your new employer\u2019s work retirement plan if you want to make any Roth IRA contributions in the future.",

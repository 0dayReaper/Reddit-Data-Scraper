Make about 85k/yr. Only debts I have is about 6k in student loans. Looking to buy my own house. \n\nMy problem: I have $12k in my checking/savings account. $21k in a money market. Various stocks with a market value of about $25k. So it\u2019s somewhere around 33k \u201ccash\u201d. Down from what I paid into of about 45k. I have a Roth with a market value of about 100k. Total cost is about 65k. \n\nMy question: I am constantly going through 3 options in my head. \n\n1. Would it be worth it to completely empty out my Roth for a down payment; and get smoked with capital gains taxes? \n\n2. Sell the stocks at a loss and just use those, plus the other \u201ccash\u201d I have for my down payment?\n\n3. Keep the stocks as is. Sell what I\u2019ve paid into my Roth ($65k) and use the \u201ccash\u201d I have has down payment. \n\nI\u2019m consistently leaning towards option 3, but I\u2019m having difficulty committing to it. Frankly, I can\u2019t find anything I truly want to buy in the first place, but I want to be able to pull the trigger when that time comes. \n\nOther info: I have already been pre-approved for a mortgage, etc. \n\nI\u2019ll try to answer any other questions as they come along. Thank you all in advance.",

When I was looking at his statement recently I noticed part of his 401k owned about 200 shares in the company he works with. However the 401k values his shares about 1/2 the stock market value. This confuses me. \n\nHe is currently being given a bonus and he received notice that if he wants to keep the portion of his bonus that he has to change his contributions. In my mind I feel that it is wiser to leave the maximum contribution as it is as it is pre taxed and we do not earn much from our savings (we will retire in 4 years) but now I am reluctant because I feel cheated on the value of the stocks we supposedly own. \n\nTLDR: how does 401ks work, is there a reason stocks claimed to be purchased from 401k contributions be less valuable than what the stock market reports? What is wiser contributing to the 401k a bonus or savings?",

It's a qualified 401k plan that combines an ESOP. The advantage is that the ESOP (employee stock ownership plan) portion is tax deferred. \n\nWhen you say that his employer contributes a matching amount - is that amount in cash, stock or a combination of both? \n\nThe value of the shares may simply be a vesting period which is not unusual. \n\nAs for whether to contribute a bonus into a qualified retirement plan vs having it be taxable - it really depends on your financial situation and your future needs. Note - that there is a maximum contribution limit to a 401k - so if you max that limit every year which is recommended - it may not really matter what you do with that bonus - since once that limit is reached - the employer will stop deducting payroll contributions to the 401k.",

We assumed that these shares were no different from what you would own if you were to buy them from a broker. He stepped down as a yard master in 2019.

Many companies use a 4 year vesting period. Is there a reason why you think that the shares are half the stock market value? Bear in mind that UNP stock has gone down appreciably in the last year. But it's still up from 2019.\n\nThe 200 shares of UNP that you mentioned should have a market value of around  $39,000 today. \n\nAlso - you mentioned that you are retiring in 4 years - so from an investing portfolio perspective - you may want to focus on less risky investments in the 401k. A Vanguard 401k would normally provide fixed income and target date funds. If the 401k was primarily invested in a target date fund with the correct target date, that fund would have automatically reallocated it's holdings to adjust for your date of retirement.",

Previous to the move I had $500.00 automatically sent to TDAmeritrade and it would automatically invest into Vanguard funds.\r  \n\r  \nNow that it has moved over to Charles Schwab, apparently I can no longer invest directly into Vanguard with automatic purchases because I will be charged additional fees. I can invest in Charles Schwab funds with no fees. No big deal to me, I will invest in Charles Schwab index funds similar to my previous strategy - which is basically dollar cost averaging across multiple sectors.\r  \n\r  \nOk - my question is should I sell off my Vanguard Funds and move them over to my newly created Charles Schwab funds? Or should I just leave them? For some reason i think i should sell them and move them over as I will not be investing any additional cash into them - except the dividends and capital gains.\r  \n\r  \nIf you think I should sell them and invest them in the corresponding Charles Schwab Fund, any strategy how I should do that? I would say for the most part they are down 3-5% over the last year or so? Do you wait until they are back into the green at some level, or doesnt matter?\r  \n\r  \nFor some reason i am having a hard time thinking this through, anyone want to give me any opinions to help me think about this better?

You then sell the stock at \"break even\" after a huge run (i.e. you think it went up too far / too fast). You then \"re-buy\" the stock after it dips again, but get hit with wash sale since you are trading with FIFO, and your first buys were at higher prices.\n\nIf you are +12% on the stock, but your broker says you are -2% (because of the wash sale rule), what are the ACTUAL implications? Is it just meaningless?",

Is my portfolio diverse enough/too diverse? and am I supposed to invest all the money I put in? I purchased $500 FXAIX, $150 FFIJX (2065 fund), $250 FSKAX, and $100 FZROX which means all of my $1000 is invested currently.\n\n\n2. IS fidelity GO worth doing? I mainly just want to be the guy that puts money in each week and just set/forget, not trying to actively monitor the account every day, I have seen good reviews on Fidelity GO but if there is a better way to kind of passively invest that would be great.\n\n\n Any information you guys have that can help me would be awesome, thank you!",

Royalties are income derived from licensing and rights agreements of a property. \n\nThere are companies which pay dividends from royalty income. \n\nIf you want to get started to learn about the stock market - just scroll up and look in the Getting Started section of the wiki - there are links to various educational materials.

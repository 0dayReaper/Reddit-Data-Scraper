    "postText": "&gt;Federal Reserve officials, whose hike, skip or pause messaging on interest rates has become a high-stakes word puzzle for investors, seem ready to end the U.S. central bank's run of 10 straight rate increases later this month while leaving the door open to a future rise in borrowing costs.\n\n&gt;For a central bank that says it is \"data-dependent,\" the decision may be more complex than it wants, with the release on Friday of a May employment report that blew through expectations as employers added 339,000 jobs across a broad set of industries. Key inflation data since the last policy meeting also rose.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-new-projections-may-fill-void-interest-rate-guidance-2023-06-02/",

The inflation everyone is obsessing about already happened. 5% is not some instantaneous measure, it's a sum over a time period (a year) that is largely not relevant. This is why Truflation has the current rate at 2.86%, and their methodology is much more rigorous and peer-reviewed than CPI's basket of random crap.",

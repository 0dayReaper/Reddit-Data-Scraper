For $10,000 for 1 year, you get at least $2,000 upfront.  \nI don't know how sustainable it is, but even Turkey's most established banks are doing this right now. There are those who receive 40% interest for $ 1,000,000.",

            "comment": "This is not accurate. There is a financial instrument called \"Kur korumal\u0131 mevduat\" which can be translated as Currency (devaluation risk) protected deposits. It's true that the proposed interest rate is high, but in order to take advantage of this instrument, you first need to convert your USD into TRY and then keep it in a Turkish bank for some period (like 6-12 months).\n\nIf the Turkish lira keeps its value you can reconvert your TRY into USD plus interest at the instrument maturity date. If Turkish lira loses around the interest rate percentage points (say 25%) you'll get your initial USD deposit back with no USD return.\n\nThis instrument is not very liquid (as cash) and also you need to count on the Turkish banks and government to continue backing this instrument. Which might happen, but it's not with 100% certainty.",

If the hedge is 15% and the interest is 5%, then there is no perceived value in TRY deposits against buying new US T Bills at the current 5.5% rates (or buy them from the secondary markets, which will also be discounted as per the current going fed rates). However, if the hedge is lets say 10%, you can create a leveraged position, with a 100% hedge and end up having crazy amounts of profit.\nEdit: changed Fed rates from all caps to just fed rates.",

They\u2019re giving the %20-30 interest on usd basis at the beginning of account start. \n\nSo it is accurate.\n\nIn example:\n\nAssume you have 1 million usd in cash account.\n\n1.\tBank will give you 300k usd at account opening with 6 months.\n2.\tYour 1 million usd converted to 20mil TRY.\n3.\tat the end of 6 months you\u2019ll get your 1 million usd back no matter what usdtry level is.\n\nThe only downside risk here is ;\n\nDifference between official and street currency level. Because money will be converted in official currency.\n\nYou may ask why they\u2019re doing this and question legitimate of banks.\n\nReason they\u2019re doing this is to keep account balanced against regulations. If they don\u2019t balance ther account usd versus try,  they\u2019ll have to buy %8 try bond. So instead of buying long term %8 try bonds(which may cause significant loses on their budget if inflation keeps strong) they\u2019re offering %20-30 interest on their customers. Big banks like BBVA HSBC ING in Turkey offered me around %25 interest last week on usd!!",

The premium is about 5%, not 30%.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that if the Turkish lira loses about 30% value (if this is your interest rate + premium), then you will not get any interest from this instrument. You'll only get your initial USD deposit back. That's how they defined the KKM instrument. In other words, if the currency devaluation is more than the interest rate, you'll not get both the currency devaluation difference plus the interest rate. You'll only be compensated for the loss in the Turkish lira. \n\nSo, in this case, what you'l will end up losing (in addition to what you've mentioned) is the opportunity cost, i.e. USD interest you could have gotten elsewhere. \n\nThe best case scenario is that the Turkish lira will hold its value and you'll get the entire interest plus any premium offer given to you. But the current value of the Turkish lira is not sustainable.",

I\u2019m pretty sure the Turkish military is almost Russia-level suck by now.\n\nIf only the Treaty of S\u00e8vres had worked out\u2026man. Armenian Genocide reduced significantly, independent Kurdistan, diverse Anatolia with Jews/Greeks/Turks/Arabs, Constantinople as a city-state with Hagia Sofia preserved as historical site\n\nOtoh it is absolutely hilarious how he chose S-400 over F-35 and thought he could get both bc he controls the Bosphorous lolol. Smart try but Russia, now Erdogan is stuck with export MiGs. \n\nFortunately the Ukrainian Coast Guard seems to be handling the Black Sea Fleet just fine. Honestly hard to imagine why the US ever worried about the Soviet Navy in the first place. We really, really overestimated their capacity. Was reading the other day about how Japan actually worried the USSR would invade Hokkaido. I don\u2019t think they had enough boats to even get a few thousand soldiers over.",

    "postText": "I'm aiming this more at the people who manage a stocks and shares ISA or equivalent outside of the UK... people who pick and manage their own stocks instead of using hedge funds or index funds exclusively. \n\nMy journey with investing has been pretty up and down, I used to just invest randomly in companies who's names I recognised and perceived well. I didn't do anything in terms of risk management or even think about questions like how much of my capital to invest in a single position etc. \n\nSince then I've read about portfolio theory, looked at risk management and the efficient frontier, looked at monte carlo simulations, read about PE ratio TEVBIT etc and looked at tools to track those. I also use tools for tracking my portfolio, as I find the brokers themselves don't give enough of the kind of information I want... stuff like exposure, returns compared to the market, my risk level etc. \n\nSo to all you self managers out there, what tools do you find the most useful? What do you wish there was more of?",

In a sense it's that stop loss and take profit don't provide enough control... it's not so much about taking money and getting out, or cutting losses early... it's more that I build a portfolio which I expect to behave a certain way, gain returns and move with volatility withing bounds I calculated for my preferences. I want to know when my analysis was wrong and my volatility is actually much higher than expected or lower than expected and adjust for that on the fly to get back in my acceptable ranges.   \n\n\nAnd for you it seems to be a bit of that and a bit automatically controlling your exposure as your position sizes change. Particularly if you are adding 5% of you income to your portfolio each month as an example.",

Dividend stocks look like dogs and have poor returns because they're generally mature late stage companies with little growth left so their profits are distributed as dividends. Furthermore it's more tax efficient to buyback stock than pay a dividend so most companies self select out of paying a large dividend so your pool of available dividend companies further shrink to include ones that don't necessarily return the most profits to shareholders.\n\nAka they are dogs.",

They are somewhat harder to manage because the stock performance is largely cyclical (worth less after the dividend date and more beforehand)\n\nI have 2 of those (BASFY and BTI) in my portfolio. I can do the math and look at the 52 week graph but it's not as simple as looking at price growth \n\nI thought I might be buying growth stocks this year but the ones I've looked at are still too dear. When tech stocks \"cratered\" 20% down they were mostly still at 20-25 P/E\n\nThe things I found cheap this year were financials.",

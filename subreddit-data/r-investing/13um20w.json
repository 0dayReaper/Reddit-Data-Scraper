    "postText": "Hello, \n\n32 male living in USA \n\nMy only form of investment is my contribution to my 401k plan. My company uses fidelity and I\u2019m currently contributing 15% and my company matches 6%. \n\nQuestion : the ticker symbol is FFLDX target date index fund. Should I stick with that or maybe switch to another one? \n\nMy goal is to contribute 20k a year to the plan and want to make sure it\u2019s going to a good option. \n\nThanks",

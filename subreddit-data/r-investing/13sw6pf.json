    "postText": "Hello so I\u2019m 19 but at 18 very 2 weeks aid get my paycheck and break up the extra into money for my Roth IRA and my brokerage. For both however I\u2019d just buy vtsax. So let\u2019s say I had 750 extra to spend (still live with parents) I\u2019d break up the money and put it all into vtsax. I am confused however at how I have always had negative performance returns this entire time even tho vtsax has gone up in price since I started doing this. So I am worried I have been doing something wrong.",

This will pay off in the long run.\n\nLooking at the chart for VTSAX it looks like the one-year gain has been only 2%.\n\nIt's been a difficult year. I can imagine that investing the way that you are would coincidently hit multiple down turns and produce an overall down year.\n\nIt's possible to get better results by being more selective about when you make your investments but 'timing the market' is difficult.\n\nAt your age, most investment advisers would recommend taking a bit more risk. You might want to consider putting some (or all) of your contributions into a fund that tracks the Nasdaq (like QQQ). \n\nThe Nasdaq did poorly early this year but it's on fire now. Some people would tell you that this is exactly why it's the wrong time to jump on the QQQ bandwagon. They could well be right. Timing the market is difficult.\n\nYou might also want to look at ETFs that track particular sectors.\n\nEither of those alternatives are more risky and they require more involvement in your investing.\n\nFWIW, I'm a Day Trader. My sense of risk and market timing is way out of whack with most people's.",

OP, just put money in stuff that's not going away (and boring index funds are a great example of things not going away). For individual stocks, consider anything that's backed by the US government (Boeing being an example) but overall investing in broad ETFs, even if we have a full on crash and recession, will be perfectly fine with your investing strategy in the years 2065+. If somehow, investing now means you're not well off by then, you will genuinely have bigger issues to worry about than your retirement portfolio b/c the world is on fire.",

But that doesn't mean that you pour your money into an index when it's clearly struggling. However, if the current markets are beating you up and talking your lunch money, you're in the wrong place.\n\nI'm going to go ahead and assume that OP is in a situation similar to the typical 18 year old. Meaning that OP will need to pay for further education and buy a home. The rate of inflation for both of those things is far outrunning the overall rate of inflation. OP doesn't need to do 'average'. OP needs to outperform. Unless of course OP's fortunate enough to have access to a well-funded 529 and someone's about to drop a house on them.\n\nAnd maybe OP doesn't want to spend the next four and a half decades working just to retire in their early 60's. Maybe OP would like more flexibility or wants to get out of the game before AARP and Death Planning spam becomes the largest component of what's in their mailbox every day. You do that by taking more risk and learning more about investing when a mistake can be easily corrected. IOW, you do that when you're young.",

Front loading matters the most.\n\nThe greatest returns come from maximizing the amount of the early investments and maximizing their ROR. So, it's also critical to 'fix' any mistakes. The good news is that fixing mistakes is relatively easy to do for most young investors because the amount that they're investing is small in absolute terms.",

    "postText": "I am trying to do the math on a 5 year 401k loan I took out two years ago.  Looking to check my understanding.  \n\nIf I took out the loan when the market was peaked in 2021 (for simplicity let\u2019s assume my entire 401k portfolio is invested in the same fund) at $50/share, and is today trading at $40/share, would I benefit from paying off the loan today? Or would I be better off if I continue to make the monthly payments over the next 3 years?  Obviously have to assume what the market will do, so let\u2019s assume it gets back to $50/share by 2026.",

Paying it back slowly over time is the same as making extra contributions or dollar cost averaging back in.",

I am thinking it was like a credit b/c the total fund amount never changed once the loan was issued, so in that case am I also not exposed to the long term compounding loss of sold shares (since I\u2019m not exposed to the \u201cgain\u201d of buying back shares at a lower price)?",

    "postText": "What is this subreddits thoughts on this solar ticker that\u2019s been around since 2008? \n\nHas been having very good earnings reports the last year yet it\u2019s price has largely been the range of 30-40 for its entire listing history. They\u2019ve been listed  since 2006. It\u2019s current price of $39.30 is the same as it was in 2008\u2026.yes 2008! They\u2019ve grown exponentially since then. \n\nTomorrow they also list their majority owned subsidiary CSI on the Shanghai exchange to generate extra capital because they\u2019re being heavily outpaced on NASDAQ from other US solar companies such as ENPH, FSLR to name a few. Which I think are already overvalued. How long can this Company remain undervalued? A recent analyst price target was lifted from $55-70 (Roth). Which I think is a much more fair valuation compared to its current price. They also have 3 billion in cash, they do have sign significant debt but a large % is tied to ongoing projects. \n\nI truly think this stock is fantastic for a value investor, albeit a frustrating one seeing it get ignored for this long. What do you guys/girls think?\n\nNote: This is an amateurs take lol",

These are basically a commodity. \n\n\nEnphase and FSLR are playing a completely different ballgame. Enphase/Solaredge make the inverters (and Enphase dominates that market). \n\n\nFirst Solar makes Cadmium-Telluride Panels which are far more attractive from an industrial / large scale perspective.",

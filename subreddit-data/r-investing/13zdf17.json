    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI have around $5,900 in Ethereum that I have saved up since the beginning. I was wondering if I should keep this investment in the crypto or look into possibly putting it into a index funds like VOO or VTI? This is a long term investment and not something I'm looking to get rich quick. I would leave this is for a long time and possibly use it for retirement in 30 or so years. \n\n\nIs it wise to place this is VOO or VTI if not what is something that pays in the long run for indexing. I'm not against placing it in the stock market on individual stocks I just think it's a little risky and I'm looking for something long term gains. Hope all that makes sense.",

There is no reason for it to exist, and besides the current \"software running on a decentralized network\" likely will be obsolete in 30 years.\n\nStill, you miss the point, VTI is just the total US stock market.  All I said is it is close infinitely more likely that (short of global extinction) the US will have a stock market than ETH exists.  I didn't make the claim about AAPL or any other single company, in which case the number would probably be single digits.",

For greater long run reliability, get international exposure. \nVT is a fantastic option. \n\nRemember:\nWe have no idea what countries will rise in fall (from stock return perspective) and betting on your home country experiences the likelihood that you may eventually experience a bad outcome on your concentrated exposure. \nSolution? Global diversification, lower your standard deviation &amp; volatility without sacrificing your overall returns. It is a free lunch IMO. \nYou would expect a rapidly growing economy in terms of their GDP growth rate to have higher stock market returns.\n\nA fantastic quantitative paper on why we should NOT expect continued US equity outperformance moving forward.\n\nhttps://images.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Perspectives/The-Long-Run-Is-Lying-to-You.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=D3D54F4C180A564D8227FBCFCEC3366E\n\nTLDR, Almost ALL of the US stock market outperformance relative to international from 1980 to 2020 is explained by the expansion of US price multiples relative to international price multiples. US businesses did not perform better in aggregate, but how expensive they were per unit of earnings increased more (2-3x more).\nShould we bet on that continuing ?  It is probably unwise to assume that the expansion of price multiples in the US will continue to 2x-3x again when compared to international price multiples.\n\nFurther reading related to why we should not expect continued US Out performance\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3689958\n\n\nUsing a bootstrap methodology on data from 38 developed markets from 1890 to 2019, a representative investor loses purchasing power in domestic stocks 13% of the time vs. 4% in international stocks.\n\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3964908",

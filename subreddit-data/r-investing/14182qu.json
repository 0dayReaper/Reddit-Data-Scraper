Feel free to post here! \n\nIf your question is \"I have $10,000, what do I do?\" or other \"advice for my personal situation\" questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:\n\n* How old are you? What country do you live in?  \n* Are you employed/making income? How much?  \n* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)  \n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  \n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  \n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)  \n* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?  \n* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.  \n\nPlease consider consulting our FAQ first - https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/faq\nAnd our [side bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/about/sidebar) also has useful resources.  \n\nIf you are new to investing - please refer to Wiki - [Getting Started](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/gettingstarted/)\n\nThe reading list in the wiki has a list of books ranging from light reading to advanced topics depending on your knowledge level.

            "comment": "tldr at the end. I'm looking for good ways to learn/become more literate in investing/finance/economics.\n\nI'm 26, and in the last year, for the first time, my income has got to a point where investing a sizeable portion of it is a reality, and it's likely to increase quite a bit more within the next year. I'm by no means making a ton of money, but between a few different sources of income and a growing side business, I'm hoping for a minimum of 6 figures in 2024. I'm also looking to significantly reduce my expenses by moving out of my 1 bedroom apartment when the lease is up next november and either getting a studio, roommates or living in an RV (I'm leaning towards the latter).\n\nMy plan for the next decade plus is to save as much money as possible and invest the majority of my money into real estate. In the meantime I'm looking for a reasonably safe short term investment while I save up for my first down payment. The goal as of now is to put ~35-40% down on a ~$150k property in early 2025/end of 2024. I don't know if that exact plan will change, but in the meantime I'm trying to invest in something other than stocks so I can safely grow my money in the short term.\n\nI've received some general advice like a HYSA, t-notes/bills/bonds, sgov, but whenever I try to look further into alternatives to a HYSA I feel so illiterate. As soon as I feel like I'm starting to grasp the concept, I'll read a thread on reddit that makes me realize I don't understand a damn thing about finance, economics, investing, etc. \n\nI know the traditional advice is just put it in a HYSA or t-notes, don't overcomplicate it. But I want to overcomplicate it. If I can get another percent or two without adding much risk I want to do it.\n\nI know you don't have to be a financial wizard or an economist to make solid investment decisions, but I feel like it can only help to become more literate in this space, and as I'm into the whole FIRE thing, I want to do everything I can to maximize what I do with my money without being an idiot.\n\nI've mulled over returning to school part time to get some kind of degree, but I doubt that's necessary. Maybe taking a few classes at the community college would be a good idea, but I don't really know what classes I should be looking for. I want to get a strong understanding of the basics/fundamentals of types of investments and the economics that influence them, rather than just watch some YouTube channel that will give me advice. I want to make sure I understand the terminology educated people are using in this space.\n\nWhether this means taking college courses, something on the internet, a few books, or maybe there is a YouTuber who does a great job at this, I'm wondering what suggestions people here have, and really appreciate any insight. I would prefer not to have to spend much if any money, but I'm open to doing so. Thanks.\n\nTldr: I'm able to truly invest for the first time in my life and want to develop a strong understanding of the terminology and basics/fundamentals of types of investments and the economics that influence them, particularly involving shorter term investments as I save money to invest into real estate.",

Between my Roth IRA and other investments, I\u2019ve built up a portfolio of almost $6,000 in my portfolio. I know this isn\u2019t a lot, but I feel excited to continue this journey so that I don\u2019t have to worry about my financial life now, or later on in my life. Not asking for advice, just wanted to share. :)",

Got a job in late 2022.\n\nI only started my brokerage account and Roth IRA on June 2, 2023. Right now I have 34 shares of QQQM ETF and 1 stock of BoA. My income is not terribly large: 32,000$ at most (although my income is technically tax free as I am working for a NGO on diplomat visa)  \n\n\nI fear that I already missed the initial AI Bull Market to a comical degree and that at 24 years old, I have missed out on a lot of gains that many people my age have made. It was super hard to get a SS number and I wasn't making enough money to really invest while in college. I also have an overspending problem because I give into my hunger and eat out a lot, I don't have a car, so transportation costs (especially flights) cut into my income. My apartment also costs $1,160 every month and this is actually cheap for Washington DC. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDid I choose the absolute worst time to invest now that interest rates are rising and war with China is practically inevitable?",

I'm saying if this were compared to something like a mutual fund your returns would be compounding with the principal, whereas in this case you're just receiving a return when it reaches maturity in 8 weeks. I'm asking how to figure out the effective annual return if you were to reinvest the return. To calculate such a figure I would have to guess would need to be based on the assumption of rates staying the same for at least a year. But regardless, the annual return (on the original 8k) should be higher than 5.35% if you're reinvesting, right?\n\nEdit: OK let me rephrase this. I understand it's an annualized return, not an annual return, and that you'll probably not see the same quoted annualized return for the next year. But let's say you bought $25k of T-notes and kept reinvesting the returns into more T-notes for a year. Wouldn't the return on that initial 25k be higher than the average annualized return of all the t-notes you bought that year, since you reinvested the returns?",

Apple's history is to take a new unrefined technology that exists but is not at the forefront, polish it up, make it shiney and attractive for the average consumer, slap a real high price tag on it, and mint some money from it.     VR hardware is rife for that.  \n\nI know  it's been coming, and was a little tempted to buy AAPL for it but, I'm already too heavy in AAPL via index funds.   \n\nJust looked, yup, that looks good, and that looks like a better application of a headset than the 3d game type stuff or FB fantasy things that are out there, but, at that price, $3500,  uffda, it ain't for me, that's like an entire paycheck.     I couldn't stomach a $500 Oculus, a $3500 apple isn't going to be more palatable.    AR aspect is interesting, Google failed with that, we'll see if it catches on this time.  \n\nFB was investing heavy in this meta-verse world, and had bought Oculus years ago to that end, and hired a bunch of folks for it.   I wonder if Apple gets headsets on people's heads, if that will make that meta-verse pop for FB.     \n\nPersonally I'll wait for a copy.     Google's copy phone was pretty good, and look where it got them.  Same with the Windows and Microsoft.      Based on this history, it will help Apple for a bit, but only until it gets commoditized, and the proprietary and expensive nature of the Apple device starts to  make it less appealing.  \n\nI wonder if you can use a mouse with that thing.   Eye tracking seems like it might not work well, and even if it does, it seems like it'd be distracting.",

I\u2019d say my financial obligations are little to none other than like fuel and my wants (still live w parents) and because of my position I feel that I can be extremely aggressive with investments. \n\nI do obviously have student debt that is piling up and so I\u2019d say my objective is primarily building up wealth and really learning about the markets (I want to go into finance). How would you recommend I invest my money? \n\nAlso, I have dabbled in crypto + nfts + some TA (made some big gains but lost it all hah!) but I\u2019ve recently started reading the intelligent investor and it\u2019s made me want to understand and get good at shares and bond investing \n\nAny advice appreciated!",

That doesn't mean that putting money into even a fantastic stock is even the best idea.  You might benefit more from paying for some extra education thing like studying abroad or some specialized course.  Look at all your opportunities as ways to invest in yourself.\n\nIn terms of investments just don't be in a hurry.  Be sure you want to do what you do.  With stocks, go ahead and make paper portfolios before and at the same time you invest in stocks.  Challenge yourself against yourself to see how well you can do.",

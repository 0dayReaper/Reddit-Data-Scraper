    "postText": "Hi all wanted to see if anyone else has been seeing a fair amount more news of the concept of \u201creshoring\u201d? CNBC had an article about how executive mentions on conference calls are up and growing at a faster rate than AI. With the sizable government stimulus and that most of the country actually agrees that our infrastructure needs a revamp I am curious if this could be something that we will see become more mainstream? \n\nWould assume winners are going to be companies that are far less sexy than the AI driven names &amp; unless somehow geopolitical risk subsides considerably (wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing) I have a feeling this could be a more boring growth opportunity to consider. \n\nWould love to hear thoughts, sharing some recent articles below that illustrate. \n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/06/01/reshoring-more-domestic-manufacturing-due-to-supply-chain-disruption.html\n\n\nhttps://www.scotsmanguide.com/commercial/reshoring-may-trigger-a-long-term-industrial-boom/\n\nhttps://arch-usa.com/after-stellar-performance-new-balance-ramps-up-reshoring-with-skowhegan-factory-expansion-groundbreaking-in-maine/",

With the geopolitical crap happening with China... it's bad news for supply chains if we get into any type of confrontation with them.\n\nHowever, I think it's going to be tough for the US to bring back a ton of manufacturing... we have a pretty low rate of unemployment as is and adding manufacturing to a low unemployment economy is going to drive up those labor wages pretty substantially.\n\nThose are my thoughts. Hope I am wrong though!",

You would be very surprised how much is still done by hand in a lot of manufacturing environments. Either because the business can\u2019t afford the upfront cost or downtime for installation, or because it\u2019s simply cheaper to hire a bunch of people for minimum wage (or less, see prison labor). \n\nA one time grant or low interest loan for businesses to install automation equipment would probably go a long way to accelerating automation.

Feel like that concept closes the cost gap if efficiency can increase in the US by being a leader on the automation side of things.

South American and other southeast Asian countries aren't remotely close to China in terms of cost, quality, flexibility, reliability, and delivery timing.  \n\nManufacturing in the US is astronomically more expensive. It's not even the labor costs, those are actually cheaper in Mexico. Chinese supply chain efficiency is unrivaled. Our landed cost would be at least 10X more expensive to manufacture in the US. Unless you're making an insanely high margin product, I don't understand how reshoring at scale will be at all possible for most businesses.",

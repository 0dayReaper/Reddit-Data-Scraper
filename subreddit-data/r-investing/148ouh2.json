He claims that people from the military admitted that the US government has a dozen UFOs that are \"non-human intelligence\". He has made a bunch of other allegations. He himself has not seen first hand evidence.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Grusch_UAP_Disclosure\n\nNow most people likely don't believe him but let's assume it is all true.\n\nHow should one play this in the markets?",

Frankly there are probably tens or hundreds of thousands of oddballs working at the DoD, it's not surprising that one occasionally \"goes public\" with supernatural stories.",

I dunno!\n\nLower, but not zero.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I pointed out, \"average\" numbers suggest 34,000 people with psychosis at the DoD. Even if you assume degree qualification filters out 75%, and , psych evaluations eliminate a further 90%, that's still 850 suffering psychotic episodes at any one time.\n\nAnd psychosis can start at any age without previous symptoms. It can evade psych evaluations because there's simply no sign of it until it happens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*And* this is just one of hundreds of illnesses or malicious motivations that could explain it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou saying that of 2.84m people, not a single one is suffering mental illness right now? All of them perfectly healthy? Not a single one of the 2,840,000 people wanted to fuck with their government or piss off their employer? *That's* an unbelievable conspiracy theory.",

Almost no one would really know.\n\nWith or without evidence of non human craft, theoretical physics is at a unique place that could potentially lead to a completely new understanding of the universe with potential to change technology, just like what happened about 100 years ago. Many of the brightest minds in the subject no longer view space time the same way and do not see GR compatible with gravity. The thought seems to be that space time is more existing in a holographic universe projected from something like a 2D plain. \n\nThere is a realization that a new deeper understanding is necessary, similar to GR and classical mechanics in the last century. \n\nI guess the point is, if it\u2019s true, would having the technology without understanding it be enough to use it for profit? Maybe the bigger question is are we at a point of a new understanding that could generate crazy technological advancement in things like free energy, or at least harness the tech of a supposed craft? If not, it could be useless from an investment perspective anyway.",

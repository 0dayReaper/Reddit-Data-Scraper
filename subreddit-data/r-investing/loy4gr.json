At this point the market is dancing on a knife\u2019s edge. Passive investing\u2019s IQ drain, and #stonksgoup hype, add to the danger.\"\n\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Euu1vWXVoAA3r6U?format=jpg&amp;name=small\n\n\nThere's been a lot of talks about the current market being a bubble, that could be caused by the low interest rates and QE. Michael Burry's latest tweet had a very interesting graph showing margin debt increasing to new highs.\n\n\nHadn't seen this posted and thought it could make for an interesting discussion.",

Akin to how you back a truck up to a loading dock before filling it with supplies to be shipped. Basically you\u2019re backing up the truck into a stock and filling it up with shares.\n\nThe \u201c4 day rule\u201d, in general, is a broad-strokes advice on reading the market. It certainly is not always true (the stock market never is), but it has solid market dynamics backing it. One of which being the concept of reversion to the mean.\n\nIf a stock dips 4 days in a row, and is not fundamentally failing or correcting from a spike, then the dip is likely related to market dynamics that are separate from the underlying company\u2019s performance.  Therefore, on day 4, it\u2019s very likely that people are going to realize it\u2019s undervalued and its going to revert back to the mean. Its an easy win!",

Personally, I am talking about the active part of my portfolio which is opportunity driven. If/when positions reach exit values i am happy with, and there are no immediate good opportunities, I am not above sitting on cash for a bit until the next attractive opportunity comes. Timing the market on your whole portfolio is not a game I play personally. Also if you have idle cash or get cash later in the year you can be opportunitistic on when to put it in.",

I'm qualifying \"Big Business (BB)\" as any business who could afford to risk at least half of their stimulus package in the stock market.\n\nBB took that money and invested it in various fashions - everything from payroll to shares buybacks and exec bonuses.\n\nA LOT of money was reinvested into the market, and this in turn raised the avg stock price, which in turn raised the major market indexes, and, \"oh look, see, the market rebounded!\"\n\nSo it **looks** like an economic recovery, but only if you use the stock market indexes as an index for the economy.\n\nIn some cases, they really are.  In some cases, they're not.\n\nCaveat emptor.",

His past fund returned 500% over it's lifetime (2000-2008) before he shut it down for personal reasons. Since his fund re-opened, we just don't have enough data to determine what his returns have been but he's struck it big on a couple of plays that showed up in his fund's 13F. And no, he hasn't been fucked yet on his TSLA position. He took out a short position in December and has continued to let it grow. Time will tell. I think everyone knows TSLA is a bubble, it's just if he timed it right or has the balls to wait out massive losses for that bubble to deflate.",

That fund did not have to buy a single additional share on my behalf. It just bought and hold those shares as they increased in value. My long-term passive investment had no price impact.\n\nAlso, imagine the alternative. If we equal-weighted indexes, with a given purchase you'd get $100 of Apple and $100 in Bob's Corner Apple Stand that makes $100/week selling apples. Basically Apple would be unaffected while the Apple Stand skyrocketed in value out of proportion to its size. Cap-weighting is neutral, not distorting.\n\nAnd of course, there are plenty of active players set to arbitrage things, regardless.",

Suddenly lower-middle class people have extra money for the first time in their life and are learning to invest, combined with a generation of younger employees having the free time to up their game from investing to options trading.  All of a sudden everyone and their mother is pumping money into the stock market.\n\nThe difference between today and 100 years ago is back then you could get 10:1 margin and even 20:1 margin when investing.  This led to an extreme bubble and an even more extreme crash.  Today we have regulation in place for this (2:1 margin today), so even if we're seeing the formation of a bubble, there is no way it will become anything like the 1920s.\n\n&gt;When your shoeshiner is recommending you stocks, you know its time to get out.\n\nThe difference between today and a shoeshiner, is a shoeshiner back then is like a paperboy today, or do paperboys still exist.. er.. lol.  It's the same as some kids running a lemonade stand and getting into investing.  Taking a step back, imagine if right now it was common for 16 year old McDonald's employees to get into investing.  There is a clear difference between a working 20-something year old getting into investing (which is normal) and a near minimum wage employee teenager getting into it, and there is a difference between a near minimum wage employee getting into it and kids getting into investing.  The 1920s was a crazy time.  It's hard to put it into perspective, because we have seen nothing close to it and probably never will in our life time.",

It makes it so confusing to read the graph.\n\nAlso, I'm going to have to disagree with Burry here, there's a few key components to the use of margin overtime that he's missing that makes this graph a lot less useful. \n\n* Brokers are more willing to give out margin today then they were in the past (see the criticism RH has gotten over giving out margin too easily, though they aren't the only ones to lower the requirements), so of course there's more margin today then a few decades ago.\n\n* The prices of taking out margin have been going down overtime. RH made headlines just a few months ago for cutting their margin price down from 5% to 2.5%, which caused a bunch of people to speculate at reddit that you could double your profits by investing in a safe dividend paying stock with at least a 3% yield to pay off the margin expense. Also if RH is charging such low margin rates, how long do you think the other brokers can go without lowering their margin rates to?\n\nHence no matter what state the market is in, of course those two things would cause more people to be using margin these days. \n\nThat said, I think Burry is right about one thing he's implying. The heavy use of margin is going to push the market to bigger highs, and then when it goes down it will push it down much more rapidly then it otherwise would have in the past as a bunch of over-leveraged investors get margin called and are forced to sell at bad prices.",

When you get a crash a lot of people are instantly margin called, which exasperates the selling on a macro level. If everyone was on a cash only account then a lot of people could ride out the swings. You were very wise to ride out the Covid March crash, but if you sold or were margin called you realized some nasty losses. Likely you did not re-time your re-entry and just got a haircut.\n\nA lot of newer investors and market participants and FOMO means we are usually always max invested. I bet only 1/10 have say 15% of their portfolio in cash ready to buy a stock market sale/crash...\n\nAnyway, this guy is not a prophet, and he might be right but he might be years ahead. He was years ahead on his big short and meanwhile the party kept going. Don't try to time the market. What you CAN do is keep some cash aside, and don't buy on margin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I will also add that I do not think we will see a crash for 1-2 years just because the government will stop at nothing to restore employment, and we're still a ways off from recovery. They've also found that direct household stimulus is the greatest way to stimulate ever and they will continue hitting this button for a while.   \nI DO THINK we will have March level 30 % monthly corrections though, and as quickly ramp back, just because there is no where else to park your money.",

Before recessions bubbles occur in which the S&amp;P rises along with Margin Debt meeting momentarily before the bust. After which, both retreat as the recessions causes a downturn.\n\nThere should have been a recession in 2014ish, but likely due to the growing popularity of ETFs/Index Funds, low interest rates (thus no Bond market), massive quantitative easing and huge cash reserves held by corps (I think Apple alone had $65B in cash at one point around 2012-13ish), the market was flush with cash pushing indexes higher and growing margin debt.\n\nNow, we appear to be in an unprecedented bubble with no real end in sight as we've entered a recession where real economic growth and capacity has been impacted yet no pullback has occurred in either index values nor margin debt.\n\nWho the hell knows what happens now though. Wonder what the 1925-1933 graph looks like with similar measures.",

They could be right this time, but I wouldn\u2019t use a single article as the sole basis for significantly altering your investment strategy. Also, what happens if interest rates get cut and the market reacts favorably? Now you\u2019re stuck in a money market fund with a lowering yield, and if you attempt to get back in, you\u2019re not going to buy as many shares as you had before.",

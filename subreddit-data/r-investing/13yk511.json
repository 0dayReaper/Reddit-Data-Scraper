    "postText": "I've been contributing to a pension since I was 26 and am 38 now. I maintain an interest in investing, however I only poke and prod around at a novice level at best. In addition to my pension, I've been contributing to an IRA and brokerage account since I started working full time at the age of 26. I started out with a measly $50 dollars a month and am now up to about $600/month.\n\nI have invested nearly EVERYTHING into ETFs. I fully understand a little bit of knowledge is dangerous and that all my eggs are in one basket. Combine this with the fact that I've started to amass a nice little sum, and I'm really leaning toward having some type of proper fund management company to handle my investments from here on out. I should not here that the ETFs have performed incredibly in the 12 years I've been in them.\n\nSo, I signed up for a 457(B) plan at work and figured I'd just do my own little test and see which one is performing better. After about a year of monitoring I'm seeing my ETF rate of returns (.04% expense ratio) are completely crushing the rate of return on my properly managed account (expense ratio 1-2%.... can't remember).\n\n**My question**: Does it make sense to leave what has worked for me for the past 12 years to go to a properly managed account even if the rate of return is lower, just because it seems safer and seems like what I'm supposed to do?\n\nI have no plans to retire soon, I'm still 15-20 years away from that.",

Most finacial advisors will lag the market because they are NOT trying to beat the market , they are trying to give you safer returns (less draw down in recessions , more stable predictable returns) and by doing this you will almost certainly lag the market in the long run in exchange for safer more predictable returns .",

If you just need to give somebody money to hold your hand, you can even hire them and then tell them exactly what to do.\n\nI suppose you could also give them your IRA and you keep the brokerage account, some split like that.",

Make a comparison with and w/o additional fees.  Find out if indeed it is 1 or 2% and most places charge not that much. Last 12 years every investor did well. Low borrowing rate, free printing of cash money went to stock market because CD did not pay anything.  Now we are in a normal higher borrowing era, people cashed out put into Treasuries, CD. I expect the future fund returns to be less than before.\n\nOnce you make the comparison you can project for the long haul.",

They surely perform better than mine DIY in a good year.  I use the actively managed fund for benchmark and have access to someone I respect for opinions.",

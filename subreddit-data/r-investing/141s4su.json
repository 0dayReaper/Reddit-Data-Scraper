I need someone to give me a \u2018cut and dry\u2019 learning experience of how all of this works without ulterior motives (correct me if I\u2019m wrong but don\u2019t some financial advisors get commission for suggesting certain stocks?). \n\nI am 21 and looking to max out my Roth account, and I also have some retirement accounts already started from past employers\u2026 Should I stick to online sources (and if so, which ones) or meet up with someone irl (and if so, what type of person would that be). \n\nI want to just throw my money into an account and not have to worry about it too much. I do not think I can handle investment as a hobby.",

The only decisions you have to make is your asset allocation (between stocks and bonds), and how much to put in International stocks (Vanguard recommends 30% to 50% of your stock portfolio should be in International stocks).\n\nBeware of the evils of performance chasing, which means making investments by what has performed well in the past.\n\nFollow this advice and you will outperform the overwhelming majority of other investors.\n\nIf you find that this is too hard to do, just put your money in a 2070 target date fund from Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab.",

It invest in the entire global stock market (about 30-40% international) and some bonds it is designed to get more conservative over time as it approaches the target date. Which means less stocks and more bonds the further the target date fund date is the longer it is in stocks more.\n\nThis way you don\u2019t have to figure out how change your allocation as you age it\u2019s basically on autopilot.",

They have a sub too  /r/bogleheads \nThe idea is just invest in the entire stock market, keep investing and hold until retirement and you are set. I\u2019d look for a simple mutual fund like FSKAX and just invest regularly and make sure to get any retirement match that your company offers. Always keep in mind that individual stocks are volatile and diversity truly means having a diverse portfolio. Besides total market funds like the one mentioned above, there are also emerging market and small cap mutual funds that can further diversify your portfolio.",

    "postText": "I feel like the NASDAQ is commonly thought of of the SP500's younger teenage brother. Moody, unreliable, unpredictable. Yeah it posts some good gains but you wouldn't invest in it over the gold standard SP500 because it might crash or be too volatile.\n\nWell I thought that way before but am starting to take a different mindset. Tech really isn't going anywhere. The internet was objectively humankind's biggest advancement in the past couple hundred years. AI is still young, and what other technologies or advancements are yet to be made that we can't even dream of?\n\nWhat is the leader of modern day advancements and technologies? Tech. It's not Home Depot or Walmart or Walt Disney Co, and by the way most of the top SP500 constituents are actually tech.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you bought the NASDAQ at the very height of the internet bubble you would still be outperforming the S&amp;P today. If you bought into NASDAQ in 2008 lows you would be up over double what the S&amp;P has returned. If you bought NASDAQ the day it was tradable you would be up over double the S&amp;P has returned - almost 25 years of data. If you bought the NASDAQ at the December 2021 highs before the recent crash you are today at parody with S&amp;P returns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am 28 years old. How far ahead will the NASDAQ be above the S&amp;P when I retire and start withdrawing in 40 years? I'm switching up my gold standard and going to start buying NASDAQ instead of S&amp;P when I am looking to invest in a stock index.",

It is the one that is most adaptable to change.\u201d ~ Darwin\n\n\u201cIf we fail to adapt, we fail to move forward.\u201d ~ John Wooden\n\nThe market has changed, and will continue to change. This time it IS different, and it will be different tomorrow, and next month, and so on. You can adapt and continue or be a dinosaur and become extinct. \n\nTraditional stock trading is dead. Forward P/E, intrinsic values, market cap, shit, even the VIX are all broken. You can trade like it\u2019s still 1979 if you\u2019d like, and that\u2019s fine. But if you can\u2019t (or refuse to) see that things are different, then you will become a fossil: a relic of times gone by.  Your prerogative.",

The economy is increasingly consolidating into the top handful of companies, everyone with eyes can see AI as a revolutionary tech disruption, and whatever winners come out of the gold rush are going to be rocketing up the NASDAQ 100 index. We're now recovering out of a once-a-decade blowoff top and this is likely an amazing entry point. I have a matching 401k for barely beating inflation last resort money, I see no reason to not expect considerable growth in the coming years, and I'm investing in it with leverage.\n\nIf you're trying to park some unneeded money for 40 years and have the self-control to just never sell your shares, consider getting even spicier than QQQ (which is already too spicy for most of this subreddit). The leveraged index ETFs are ridiculously high performing instruments with no margin debt risk, and would have done just as well when backtested for the entire lifetime of the stock market. Everyone dumps on TQQQ, but to date, after the blowoff, it's seen over 8000% gains over the last 13 years of its lifetime. As a young growth-minded investor I highly recommend reading this article: [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4226165-trading-strategy-beat-s-and-p-500-16-plus-percentage-points-per-year-since-1928](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4226165-trading-strategy-beat-s-and-p-500-16-plus-percentage-points-per-year-since-1928)",

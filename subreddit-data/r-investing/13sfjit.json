    "postText": "Say I am down $10000 over the last two years and this year I made $10000 breaking even. Do I still need to pay taxes on the $10000 profit for this year? \n\nI know that there is the capital loss carryover of $3000 per year but how does that work. Doesn't make a lot of sense to be paying taxes when you are taking profit at an overall loss or breaking even.",

The deduction against ordinary income (aka W2 wages) is limited to 3k.\n\nThus, if you deducted 3k last year against ordinary income, and have 7k left in overall capital loss carryforward, you can use the full amount against current year capital gains (provided you still have more capital gains than your capital loss carryforward at the end of the year). If you have any losses left over afterwards, you can deduct up to 3k against ordinary income again.",

In the US at least (and I imagine most of the world, although I am no international tax expert), unrealized gains are not taxed until the security is sold. There are certain specific exceptions, however, such as if you own a PFIC (Passive Foreign Investment Company) or securities subject to Section 1256 or 988, which could require them to be \"Marked to Market\" (or treated as realized at the end of each year, even if unsold). Those are a bit more advanced though.",

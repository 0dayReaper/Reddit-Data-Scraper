    "postText": "Hi. So I am a relatively new investor mainly in stocks and ETF's. Still I am trying to deepen my understanding of various instruments and was hoping you guys might help me out. I have been reading up on warrants I was hoping you guys might confirm my understanding or correct my misunderstanding :)\n\nThe online broker i am using has two types of warrants - Call and Put. Both have three characteristics 1) Strike price 2) delta 3) expiry date. Now my understanding is that by buying a call warrant i basicly buy the right to buy shares on a future date for a predefined price. \n\nExamle: There are Calls on Apple shares. The strike price is USD 128 and the expiry date is 20.12.2024 and delta 0.81. So if i understand correctly by buying 1 warrant for EUR 7 I will have the opportunity to buy 1 Apple shate on 20.12.2024 for USD 128. The delta seems to be an indicator of the volatility of the Warrant.\n\nI am pretty sure i am missing something as this sounds too good to be true. So basicly if i want to invest in Apple instead of investing USD 180 today in 1 Apple share, i could invest (buy) a warrant for EUR 7 with the same idea and if the share prices does increase i could excercise the warrant for USD 128 (USD 50 lower than the price if i buy a share to hold today). If the share price is lower than the strike price i wouldn't excercise the warrant while in the meantime i could have invested my money in other stocks.\n\nI have a similar question for the put warrant but lets see first about the calls as I am pretty sure I am missing something",

            "comment": "1) you are looking at options, not warrants \n\n2) you have the basic terms (mostly) correct. \nDelta is basically a measure of how much the price of the option will move for a $1 move in the underlying stock. Implied volatility is a different concept. \n\n3) the price you are quoting is wrong. If it were right, it would indeed be free money. It\u2019s probably $70 not $7. \n\nAfter you learn the basics, the first thing everyone will tell you is to be careful with options. They are much riskier than buying stock and if you don\u2019t know what you are doing you WILL end up burned.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for taking the time to provide valuable information and advice!\nAfter your comment i checked again the details of the Warrant and it seems there is another characteristic i missed - ratio. Namely, the warrant i am looking at has a ratio of 0.1 which seems to mean that for the price of EUR 7 i get 0.1 shares. So I need to buy 10 warrants to get 1 share which brings the cost to EUR 70 as you said. If this is so, it makes much more sense.\n\nOn the name of the instrument, in the broker i am using it is listed as a warrant, so i don't know.\n\nWould you mind if i ask you a couple of questions about the Put type of warrant?",

            "comment": "Delta, Theta, etc. are loosely referred to as the Greeks and forget about those for  now. Let's just focus on your buying a call option scenario.  What you are missing is not only would you have the potential for opportunity loss (the other stocks you mention) you will also lose your entire investment should you not sell or exercise before or on the expiry date.  Also, 1 contract maps to 100 shares, and generally the market price listed is per share. I respectfully recommend not investing in puts for now, as they are a bit harder to wrap your head around and could expose you to risks beyond your initial investment. Calls can too, but not in your example given. Definitely talk through your first trade with your broker, they are there to help.",

If you are investing in airlines, you have to ponder how much business travel is going to be replaced in the future by virtual meetings. Conventions aren't going to be happening for a while, too. \"But while demand returns to normal, it will be from a base with less business travel. \u201cBefore we used to have these internal meetings and things of that nature, and I think this is going to be way more Zoom-oriented, other types of substitutes,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at the routes that the airlines are planning when they come back, they\u2019re not going to be at the same level that they were previously.\u201d",

They had me come in, *insisted* I come in, over a Memorial Day weekend. Since they were paying me my highest day rate, I agreed. First day I did nothing, because they weren't really prepared yet. They didn't even have a computer set up for me. \"Listen I can go home and come back when you're ready. That way at the least the meter's not running\"  \n\"no, no we NEED you here, once this kicks off\". Did nothing but hang outside on my mobile all day. The next day I came in, they had a computer, but still no brief from Google yet. Did nothing but surf on the computer all day. \n\nThis went on for 3 more days, until the last day when they finally had everything.  \nAll told I spent maybe 2 hours that day making illustrations. No one was really in the office because of the holiday, save for a project manager who was working on a different account. So being there was just an exercise in supposedly micro managing me to make sure I completed my work, but essentially pointless because no one stuck around to supervise.\n\nBut hey I got paid top tier day rate, for 5 days, to do 2 hours of work total.  \nIronic part of this: the reason I insisted on working from home was that I was also illustrating for Google directly for a different project at the same time.",

Ask around for other estimates.  Maybe another artist can do it quicker and cheaper, but is it as good as the other guy who may have provided a longer turn-around time but has a great and proven portfolio and is in high-demand, hence the higher rate?\n\nYou'll get a better end-result by trusting the creative to meet his/her deadlines compared to dragging them to the office and hovering over their shoulder.  If you're scared of getting burned, then hire contractors that have proven track records, great portfolios and are well-reviewed by prior customers.",

It stated they had 3 other designers working on the project (I was the sole designer/art director for the whole thing). On top of that they were paying all of \"us\" my original day rate that they balked at.\n\nFunny, I think the thing that stung the most from that particular job was that they made me (and other designers on another project) work late a few times and instead of doing the customary agency thing of buying us dinner, they said \"Ok everyone, who wants pizza!?

Once we came back I gave everyone a post-mortum and told everyone WFH is off the table for everyone except for the others who did well.

I then got reported to HR, explained the situation to HR they then banned WFH company wide. \n\nNone of that is exclusive to telecommuting though, and this discussion was never about having everyone telecommute, but rather the viability of telecommuting as an option. It sounds like you had much bigger problems as a company with your workforce's diligence and motivation, but even by your own admission some of your employees were fine working remotely. I personally know about several companies which have transitioned to 100% remote without a significant decrease in productivity.\n\nFurthermore the way you attempted to implement the telecommuting policy after the fact was kind of reckless by the sound of it. I say this as someone who had to develop a telecommuting policy for a small company, it was a pretty complicated process. \n\nYou were a manager, and then you tried to unilaterally implement a telecommuting policy, that created huge liabilities for your company, without going through HR. Of course you got in trouble and it backfired. I'm just going based on what you wrote, I'm not accusing you of any wrongdoing, because I think you were trying to do the right thing and should have been accommodated. I'm just commenting on the realities of corporate bureaucracy, labor rights, and discrimination. Based on your description it sounds like you share some of the blame for screwing up telecommuting for your employees that it could work for.",

You can't just stop by an office or two to decide a few quick issues.

It's not for everyone but it is definitely for me. I'm an order of magnitude happier working this way than I would if I had to deal with traffic. My dogs are just hanging out when I work and I can play around in my garden after I've been staring at code for too long or cooped up in meetings for too long.

I usually eat healthier at home and of course that time savings lets me sleep longer but also sleep easier knowing I don't have to be there at 8am.  \n\nAs my dog gets older the time with her is more valuable so if someone paid me 2x to have to go in and work in an office I probably wouldn't take it.  The opportunity cost of time and healthier sleeping and eating WFH is too great.  Plus like you said if I'm mentally drained I can go do a load of laundry, walk the dog, sit outside and eat lunch at 1030, play a game on my PC/console.  It still gets done, the flexibility, happiness and health are too great to give up to drive in.",

More people moving to lower cost of living places leading to more gentrification, and in higher cost of living places maybe things would begin to even out as less people have a reason to live there. Maybe in a couple generations it'd end up changing which cities are the major metropolitan capitals.",

I'm already getting weekly updates from our CFO on exactly this. Prior to this pandemic you'd never even have dreamed of these sorts of cost-savings.\n\nAnd the cost-savings of eliminating travel is just the start.

They said nothing, and I believe that is because productivity has dropped.",

Hear me out:\n\nIf the sole reason against using remote meetings was to avoid headaches and stress (especially when the alternative was getting on a plane and flying out) then that says a lot about either the quality of business class travel, the face-to-face preferences of business representatives, or (more likely) a combination of the two. Not to mention modern software like Teams is far and away more modern than Skype ever was, and it has been available for some time as well.\n\nI would suggest that instead of a lack of friction, this is more like the application of sufficient force. People are forced to work remote and Zoom just happened to get public mentioning in a time when people needed a social integrating tool.\n\nCall me crazy, I think that instead of Zoom being necessarily the superior tool for the job, it's likely the beneficiary of being in the right place at the right time.",

More people may choose to 'telecommute' to their job from far away, then take flights periodically for face to face meetings.\n\nWe have a friend who is a CFO at a large company and he mentioned that with how smoothly things are going with telecommuting, he'd be much more open to filling in a role out of their office in a different city, vs in the city we live in. \n\nTo add to this- if you are just going into the office 2 days a week, you may not care about your commute time as much anymore. Cue people moving further out into cities to get larger houses for the same price, but with longer commutes and higher fuel usage/trip.\n\nSo- I think this could go either way- we won't know until things stabilize.",

I had a client in Tampa that bought from us regularly but I had never met.  So my boss says, \"let's go see them.\"  We do that.  Book 2 round trip airline tickets for next Tuesday and get a reservation at a good restaurant in Old Town and early Tuesday, away we go.  Rent a car, drive to the plant, meet the plant manager and the purchasing agent take them to lunch and back to the airport and fly back to Houston for dinner.  There were only two suppliers of my product and you need to wave that flag every so often to keep your customer.  Would a Zoom meeting have worked?  Not worth the chance that it wouldn't because our competitor could maybe actually go meet them in person.  I stole a lot of business over the next few years, following that go take them to lunch mantra.  I flew in and out of some tiny airports but had some nice lunches and spent a whole lot on airplanes but at the price of our products and to either keep the business or steal business from our competitor it was well worth it.  I am not sure that will change.",

Feel free to post here! \n\nIf your question is \"I have $10,000, what do I do?\" or other \"advice for my personal situation\" questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:\n\n* How old are you? What country do you live in?  \n* Are you employed/making income? How much?  \n* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)  \n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  \n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  \n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)  \n* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?  \n* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.  \n\nPlease consider consulting our FAQ first - https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/faq\nAnd our [side bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/about/sidebar) also has useful resources.  \n\nIf you are new to investing - please refer to Wiki - [Getting Started](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/gettingstarted/)\n\nThe reading list in the wiki has a list of books ranging from light reading to advanced topics depending on your knowledge level.

I'm in college and I'm working this summer, but I don't have a strong income. College is mostly paid for, but I still might have to take out a loan for the last year.\n\n I would like to have enough money for any big purchases I might have to make after I graduate and if I don't need to spend it I will keep it invested. I will most likely want to sell sometime in between 5-10 years from now and I would rather not take on much risk. Thanks",

The TEY (tax equiv yield) could be higher. \n3. just buy t-bills and agency bonds which may have slightly better rates\n4. you could possible find brokered CDs that have a better yield\n5. since you already trade options - an SPX box spread would probably generate higher yield with similar risk characteristics.  A 6 month box is currently around 5.4%.\n\nDeepends on whether you want to play around with the interest rate or not. I personally would stick it in a box spread.",

Presumably, if buying using a limit order as opposed to market order, I would lower the price I would buy for to a certain level below market price and wait for the order to be 'filled'. But after doing some research, I've come no closer to exactly how much lower? I used investopedia's fake (educational) trading platform to buy something trading at a little over 100$, but I only lowered the market price by a couple of percent of its market price. It got filled pretty quickly; is there any general rule for how much lower than market price one should pick for a limit order? Whilst I guess the answer is \"whatever it's worth\" isn't that what the market price is roughly supposed to dictate?",

All kinds of things factor into the price of a stock, or more specifically, people's desire to buy the stock which causes the price to go up.  More demand than supply, price goes up.  But lots of things can influence people's desire to buy a stock and not all of it is rational.  Some of it is hype.  Some of it is guessing about what the company will soon do, or how the economy may hurt/help the company in ways it has no control over.\n\nSo you either should ignore all the noise and just buy an index fund that gives you diversification so you are less tied to one single companies success, or you start down the path of learning to evaluate companies and equip yourself with more tools to make more informed guesses about how the company will perform in the short, medium, or long term.  If you go the latter route, then you ignore what the market says the stock is worth, and you come to a decision on what you think the company is worth, and then you can make potentially a more informed decision on what prices you want to buy and/or sell at.",

My Roth IRA is maxed and a 401k not offered by my employer - What is my best option to make additional stock investments?\n\nFor context, I\u2019m 26 and relatively new to investing. I\u2019ve taken a simple approach so far. I\u2019ve opened a Roth IRA trough Fidelity and have been maxing it out, placing most funds into S&amp;P 500.\n\nI\u2019m currently living with my parents, no rent, and have enough income that I\u2019d like to invest more than my IRA allows. My employer doesn\u2019t offer 401k, so that isn\u2019t an option. \n\nI have placed some funds into a high yield savings account through my credit union, which will earn me some money. This is nice and I\u2019d like to do more of it in the future. However, I\u2019d like to place more in the stock market as well and let it sit, essentially the same as I\u2019m already doing with my IRA.\n\nWhat is the most effective and efficient way to do this in my position? Are there any kinds of other accounts available to me? I also would like to keep my current tax situation simple if possible. If I can pay taxes up front or delay it until I sell the stock decades later, those options would be preferable. Just don\u2019t want to deal with taxes every year on stocks if that makes sense. \n\nAny suggestions are appreciated!",

Like an IRA it is an investment vehicle that will grow tax free until money is taken out.  And if the money taken out is used to pay medical expenses, there may not be any tax at all.\n\nOther than that, probably time to start looking at a normal brokerage account. Edit: In which case, if you want your taxes to be simple avoid Limited Partnerships (LPs), as they have additional tax forms they send out in addition to your normal consolidated 1099 from your brokerage.",

I\u2019m not sure if Fidelity allows a DRIP for stocks but that\u2019s a great way to grow your money by utilizing the wonder of compounding. If the DRIP also allows fractional shares than that\u2019s even more amazing. \n\nThe S&amp;P 500 is a great place to start and the majority of portfolios should be in there. However, please please please be aware of YouTube gurus who preach pump and dump stocks and who also claim that they\u2019ve found the newest Microsoft. The best advice anyone can give, in arguably any area of life, is to read. Simply do a Google search and search some terms yoy are unclear about. Or buy a book (The Intelligent Investor) and digest the material contained in it. Develop your own philosophy on what your risk tolerance is and how you want your money to work for you. You may be more risk tolerant and may want to go more growth stocks or you may be more risk averse and stick with safe big blue chip stocks. There are a F ton of options out there and lots of ways to make money\u2026. and lose everything within a matter of minutes.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be right for me to say to you what exactly you need to put your money into. That\u2019s up to you. Educate yourself on different areas of the market and how the overall market works. From there, go from there. Investment is also a bit of trial and error. However, have a plan for success and if it goes south, have an effective exit strategy for every investment you plan on buying into.",

Or have that managed for you in a robo-advisor or stick it into a target date mutual fund. \n\nOr if you have low risk tolerance - you can just have a higher allocation of fixed income investments. \n\nSomething like this - [http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy\\_Portfolios](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_Portfolios)",

I don't use an allocation model since I trade actively. \n\nYou shouldn't just copy any of those portfolios. They are simply concepts based on a long term investment thesis.\n\nThings like your age, family obligations, etc. should be factors in deciding how you decide on the allocation percentages. \n\nFor example - since you are in your 40's - perhaps it makes more sense to have higher percentage of fixed income vs equities. If you have kids to put through college - that may also be a factor depending on when you need to draw on funds. Do you have a thesis on emerging markets - maybe more or less of international equities if you do. \n\nYou mentioned you have a 401k - how did you decide on the allocation? You could just do the same thing.",

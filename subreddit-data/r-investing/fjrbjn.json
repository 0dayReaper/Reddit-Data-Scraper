In 2007 and 2008 nobody had smart phones. Nobody had easy access to Robinhood or any other brokerage app. It was much harder to trade back then. The 08 recession took 200+ days to see the market drop this one took less than a month. Yeah this dip happened very fast but I think this dip will also correct itself much faster than the last. The stock market crash of the 30s took a decade (10 years) to recover the 80s recession took over two years the 08 recession took 18 months. I think we are seriously discounting our abilities our resources and the amount of investors today are far more connected than before.",

Sure, on the fringe they might make an impact, but it's the mutual funds and big money managers that are managing everyone else's money, not to mention the index funds, pension funds, etc, that really move things.\n\nBut here's the thing. Looking at the Dow... \n\nDotcom\nJan 2000 peak at 11,700\nOct 2002 bottom at 7,300\nOct 2006 back to 11,700\nPeak to peak almost 6 years\n\nCheap money started after the dotcom bust and has continued since then. \n\nHousing\nOct 2007 peak at 14,000 (20% above prior peak) \nFeb 2009 bottom at 6,500\nFeb 2013 back to 14,000\nPeak to peak roughly 5.5 years\nThis was the recession that was going to end the world. Cheap money become the standard and made the dotcom bust look like child's play. \n\nCurrent\nFeb 2020 peak at 29,500 (111% above prior peak) \nBottom? No idea. \nReturn to peak? No idea. But give the last 2, 5-6 years wouldn't be unreasonable, so 2025-2026ish. \n\nFollowing the worst recession the world has ever seen, due solely to free money policies we have more than doubled the last bubble peak. For the last two years of Obama's presidency the market was flat at around 18,000 for the Dow. Since Trump took office it was up 64% to peak. Roughly the first year of his presidency the Dow reached 26,500, a 47% gain in one yearish. The 2 years since then it gained another 11% total before the drop. I am attributing nothing to either President, just noting timing. Many would claim the tax cuts and massive stock buybacks have been the primary drivers of price growth over the last 3+ years, along with falling discount rates.\n\nEach successive bubble has gotten materially larger and the excesses more excessive. It's like tell an obese person they can lose weight by upping their double bacon cheeseburger consumption. At some point it all goes off the rails. And here we are.",

We don't know how bad it is (no testing), we don't know how bad it's going to get, we don't know how long its going to last, and we don't know what happens when you press pause on an entire economy because we have never done it.\n\nIn the absence of data beyond \"something is happening, its bad, and we paused the economy\" this is rational.  No one can say right now if its an over or under reaction.  Generally we would have models to turn to that would give us some idea of the severity of the problem, but this is just completely unprecedented and there is little data to go off of anyway.\n\nThat level of uncertainty causes fear causes sell offs.  Trump really shit the bed with the no testing because we don't even understand the scope of the problem in the US.",

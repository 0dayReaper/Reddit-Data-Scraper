    "postText": "I have found a private company that operates in South America that I would like to invest in, (Cubbo) but I am unsure what the difference is between investing in a public and private company is. I know of course the risks of investing, but what happens if the company ceases all contact tomorrow and I can\u2019t contact them. \nIs my money covered by anything? \nWhat protections do I have as an investor? \n\nI have had a google meeting with someone from the company who mentioned something called SAFE (I think it was called), he said the money would be sent to a Bank of America account and I would receive a certificate or document that provided proof of ownership for shares. I have never invested privately before and any help would be appreciated.",

You will most likely lose all that money even if it isn't a scam.",

The company is real, however my skepticalness is growing very fast, especially with the comment about using a Bank of America account to invest in a country based in Latin America that is registered in the caymans.",

If your the nervous type illiquid investments might not be your best move.",

You can look up the value of each card easily, and there is a rating system and valuation by expert. Thousands if not hundred of thousands of traders on the net. Those are the public companies.  \n\nNow imagine some guy introduced you to the Cubbo cards. He said sales were explosive and growth was 100% last year(going from 1 to two player). You bought in and he sends you all the fancy looking cards that he printing from a local Kinkos. Two years later, you can\u2019t find him any where and the ink is faded from your cards. You can\u2019t sell them because no one heard of Cubbo. \n\nDon\u2019t do it unless you have millions to lose and an army of lawyers to look over the contract.",

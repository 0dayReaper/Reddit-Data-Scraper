In this entire episode, management only focuses on cost aspect and vendor companies bid fiercely each year to retain or gain new projects.

And these graduates within 2-3 years jumps to either product based companies or local IT companies which pay handsomely.\n\nIts more like you get what you pay for",

Virtually all of the gold that was close to the surface of the planet and in high concentrations has already been mined; this is the gold that ancient peoples mined for. These days, gold is typically mined from much deeper within the Earth and often in lower concentrations which makes it more expensive and difficult to mine now than in days past. \n\nThe suggestion that there exists an undiscovered place with a very large concentration of gold anywhere on the planet (other then largely unexplored places such as on the ocean floor or somewhere in the Antarctic archipelago) is automatically suspect in my book.",

If there was an enormous drop in the amount of available hashing power (an apocalypse scenario) there would be a very small number of computers left online. Those computers would need to find blocks at the difficulty rate that was last set when tons of computing power was online. It would take years for them to find however many blocks were needed before the difficulty actually adjusted down.\n\nIt would be like if 1 million people were all in a room solving the an enormous rubix cube. Then, all at once, everyone left the room except for 10 people. Now imagine that the rule is that those 10 people wouldn't get to work on smaller rubix cubes until they finished a few more huge ones that previously took 1 million people to solve every 10 minutes.",

Second ore is rock that has a proven value, and in order to define and prove how much gold is in the ground, many millions of dollars would have to be spent drilling, performing metallurgical studies, economic assessments etc. The Geologic Survey of India doesn't even have anything I can find on their website. Show me some sort of data that even indicates there is significant gold in the ground in the first place. At least a scam like Bre-X drilled some holes first.",

    "postText": "I opened up a betterment account because I didn't want to deal with managing stuff in TD, Vanguard, or any of the other brokerages (especially given how clunky their websites are). I started putting money into a mutual fund in June of 2021, and a Roth IRA in February of 2022. The Mutual Fund has lost about 3.53% since starting it, and the Roth IRA has gained about 3.47%. So I look at stuff like a high yield savings account with a 4.30% return rate, and I get frustrated that I've sunk so much money into Betterment, only to see that small amount.\n\nI keep telling myself \"I have a lot of stocks, when the stock market goes up, it'll fly up with it.\" But is this how a Roth IRA or Mutual Fund with a robo investor works? Will I eventually surpass my high yield savings account rate with stocks, or is it something else?",

They guide you through that percentage.  5 year money  might be 10/90 to 50/50 but it won't be 90/10.  Longer term money might be 60/40 to 95/5 but it won't be 30/70.  \n\nYou really can throw friends and family who don't know what they are doing into this fund.",

You can\u2019t compare current yields to investments from 2021, it just doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nKeep investing in betterment or any other etf you like. But remember investing in equities (stocks) is a long term thing. There will be periods of high growth then swings drastically down. Welcome to investing!",

They buy high quality funds and balance your portfolio based on your preference.  It\u2019s $3 a month.  It\u2019s great for newer investors as is takes the guess work out of it.  I do a monthly deduction out of my checking account and it is automatically invested.  I have 7 ETFs in my account.  It\u2019s set it and forget it.  It sounds like you are younger and/or a newer investor.  I would encourage you to invest this way and keep learning about investing.   Keep in mid there is trading and investing.  Trading is shorter term, investing is for the long haul. If you are younger you can\u2019t go wrong with investing in high quality, low fee, broad ETFs.  Like VOO (the bulk of my acorns account), VTI, VT.  The market can swing wildly but the important thing is to keep your eye on the prize which is retirement.  If you are completely lost just look into put everything in VOO and expand your knowledge base.  IRAs and 401ks are your best friend as the money grows tax free.",

            "comment": "Investing with a roboavisor vs investing without one is exactly the same in terms of returns (minus the roboadvisor's fee). The only difference is roboadvisors pick out portfolios for you and give you a way to automate purchasing (and might have some extra features like tax loss harvesting). Buying an S&amp;P500 fund yourself vs buying an S&amp;P500 fund via Betterment will yield exactly the same returns, which during a down market isn't surprising that it would lose short-term value.\n\nThe purpose of buying a broad market fund right now isn't to make positive returns in the short term. You buy shares when the market is bad because the shares are cheap (aka they're losing value). You accumulate as many shares as you can/feel comfortable with, and then in the future when the shares are worth more you have your_number_of_shares * future_higher_share_price.  That's investing, that's how it works. It's not something you do to see more money tomorrow, it's something you do to see more money years down the road.\n\nPersonally I'm doing both broad market investing and high-yield savings right now. I don't want to stop buying index funds because values are down and that's the best time to buy since they will one day be worth much more, but at the same time I want to secure some 4.5% returns right now. So I do both, there's nothing that says you can't do both.",

            "comment": "Stocks return on average 650 basis points above inflation with high variance.  You are paying fund fees and robo fees so we'll say 50 basis points of drag.  High yield saving accounts return about 25 basis points below inflation best case.  Your's which seems good is doing about 50 basis below inflation incidentally.  Over just about any 20 year period you can think of stocks will beat high yield savings given that spread.  On average a stock fund will have 4x as much money.  In better than average  markets more like 10x.   There are tons of 5 year periods though where high yield savings will best stocks. \n\nDo you have a 1 year time frame, a 5 year or a 20+ year timeframe when you intend to spend the money?",

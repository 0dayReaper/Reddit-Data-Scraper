Nike was up 2% at the close with a PE of 31x current year estimates.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are risky and not suitable for everybody.

It\u2019s just the convenience factor of the deliveries that\u2019s nice.\n\nWhat is different is the fact that it\u2019s getting harder and harder to find the right product because they\u2019ve bloated their advertising sections and shrunken the actual product finding stuff.  That and the fact that they\u2019re getting spammed by cheap Chinese shit that gets rated very highly for some reason.  I\u2019ve bought lots of super high rated products from there lately that have been complete shit.  Disappointing.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the reason I started buying COST.  I think there\u2019s going to be more and more room for competitors to live in the widening cracks that Amazon struggles to service.  I\u2019m a proponent of COST\u2019s low SKU high quality model to erode Amazon\u2019s retail leadership over the long term.  People want choice, sure, but they don\u2019t want to have to pick from 30 identical brown couches manufactured to the same spec at different factories.  So I think the future of retail could tilt toward highly curated experiences like COST provides.  Let COST send their sourcing experts to China to figure out who is the most reputable vendor of a specific SKU.  I don\u2019t want to pick that shit.\n\nI also don\u2019t think WMT is the right anti-AMZN play.  It\u2019s like buying YHOO if you dont like GOOG - WMT is trying too hard to be AMZN when it should be positioning itself in emerging holes in retail.  WMT still didn\u2019t learn the lesson from TGT - retail is not about simply being the absolute lowest on price.",

It's reached the point where you really have to study all the reviews intensely and \"upvote\" the critical ones, which are usually the ones with 3 stars. Sometimes you can tell when the reviews are fake (e.g. 5000 reviews on a usb cable), other times it's harder.",

A product I like was recently available for pre-order on amazon, but I will just wait to order it from the brands website on release day.\n\nThe straw that broke the camels back was certainly the issues with their own couriers deliveries. How can an amazon branded delivery service be the worst option when ordering from Amazon?",

The customer-facing problems have gotten too egregious to ignore.\n\nAs you mentioned, the third party sellers are now filled with scams. But, I also suspect that some companies who sell their own products through Amazon are using it as their outlet store to get rid of defective merchandise. For instance, I'd buy a few pairs of pants directly from a fashion brand's Amazon account (same brand, same style, same size) and it would be a Goldilocks situation where one pair was too big, one was too small, and the pair that fit just right was already coming apart at the seams when I pulled it out of the bag. This sort of thing was happening with numerous brands of apparel.\n\nThe proverbial straw for me, as if everything else wasn't bad enough, was when their customer service started to go downhill. After getting burned twice in a row by shitty support, I started looking elsewhere.\n\nAnd once I started shopping elsewhere I realized that if I'm willing to spend a little extra time looking around, I can generally find things elsewhere, often cheaper. I was basically only using Amazon because it was a convenient all-in-one shopping experience, but when that convenience is nullified by bad customer service and increasingly defective products, it's no longer actually convenient.",

I cancelled my Costco membership because even though it had tons of great deals for me and carried lots of great products, I couldn't stand to actually go there. Every trip to Costco involved 10+ minutes of circling the lot waiting for a parking spot to open. Then an hour of tetris to move the gigantic carts through the madhouse. Then a 20+ minute wait in the checkout lines that stretch halfway back in the store. It wasn't worth the hassle even though everything else about their store is terrific.",

I ordered an item from them, sent them to one of their dropboxes since I probably wouldn't be at home that time. I received an email a few days later, that the dropbox didn't work, thus the package will be sent back. The status was still open and I didn't receive any refund. When calling customer service, you could literally hear their sample sentences since they did not match the conversation we had. After all, I was explaining I used a voucher for that order and if I order it again, the voucher is not available anymore. \n\nCustomer rep told me he will manually deduct the amount of the voucher from the item if I order again. I did. Then he changed his mind it seems and said the amount of the voucher will be available for the next purchase. A few days later I passed the dropbox and have seen it showed to be deactived on the display. Sorry, but I expect that a company like Amazon has their supply chain under control. Also I expect the necessary help if they don't. And last but not least I actually lost the money of the voucher since the customer rep neither booked the amount for a new order into my account, nor did he reduce the amount of the article I ordered again. Since the amount was not that much I decided to not waste more time with unqualified reps and will avoid the company at all costs in the future.",

I've worked in marketing for over a decade and some of my first clients were major brands where the majority of their sales came from wholesalers. They were so restricted by their agreements with regards to price, how many sales a year they could offer and even how much notice they had to give every wholesaler prior to the sale so they could preempt it (this is why most places had very cyclical sales). But it seems like brands, given the abundance of people willing to wholesale their product, are starting to take back that power.\n\nWith specific regards to Nike, I've noticed more Nike stores opening up. They seem to be buying into evolving the traditional retail store into a more experiential effort.",

Actually this happened with three different electronics I bought, and after that I stopped buying electronics.

I\u2019ll buy on amazon, amazon products, books, or things I don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s counterfeit or not. \n\nThe thing with Amazon fulfillment and shipping is that amazon throws all products with the same SKU into one bin. They don\u2019t separate it by vendor. So counterfeits and genuine products all get thrown in together so some people will get real products and some will get counterfeits. So the brand suffers, the vendor selling it suffers, the customers suffer, but the counterfeiters win and most importantly, Amazon wins, at least in the short term.",

Though to be fair people can easily be abusive to what they buy and think it should last longer to the abuse they give it.  But the recalls and such I think cause customers greater concerns though.\n\nEdit:  I also bet the drive and pickup option from Walmart and Target have no doubt taken off.  But more so I can see such services becoming far more popular over time.  As they offer a sweet combo of time and convenience.  As you can order something from Walmart from your way home, hell do your grocery shopping at work, and after work swing by Walmart and pick it up.  That easily cuts down time spent in store.",

If it were a big price difference or I had no other choices, I might consider one, but I'm also going to comparison shop elsewhere as well.\n\nSome people just look for the absolute lowest price and end up with a lot of marketplace sales.  Those can be VERY mixed in quality.\n\nMy favorite are the computer parts that are super-cheap, but literally take a month to arrive from China.  They're of course always labeled as a \"gift\" with a price on the customs dec far below what was paid.\n\nI was once sitting next to the head of Amazon's import compliance team at a dinner and asked him if I should talk to him the next time I get one of those packages.  His answer was, \"I wish you wouldn't...\"",

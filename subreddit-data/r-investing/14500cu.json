Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  \n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  \n* What are you current holdings?

Many people have an issue with the need to liquidate if you want to transfer brokerages. \n\nQuestion is, why is that an issue? If I wanted to transfer brokerages, I can just liquidate, purchase an etf and transfer my money. \n\nPlease correct any misconceptions I have and add more input on why some people are cautious about FZROX. Any comments are appreciated, thanks.",

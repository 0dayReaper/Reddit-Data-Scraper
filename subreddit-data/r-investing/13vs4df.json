    "postText": "I am based in the US and am thinking of starting a position in LVMH (LVMUY through their ADR) and was curious on the tax implications of holding this position. I am aware that I will have home country tax withholdings (I believe 25% for France) on any dividends but am I also taxed on income in the US?",

            "comment": "You'll want to \"manage\" your holdings, to try to keep your Foreign Tax Paid to less than $600 -- in which case, you'll be able to take a credit for the whole amount.\n\nAbove $600 you'll need to go through the gymnastics of Form 1116, whose primary purpose is to cap that amount.  I've never completely understood the math and the mechanism, but if the foreign tax **rate** is significantly higher than the tax rate on your US income, you may not be able to deduct it all.  And France definitely triggers that calculation; I've held TOT / TTE shares for decades.\n\nI'm not saying don't do it; but I caution you that you may be signing up for a headache if you do.  You'll -absolutely- need tax software to help you through it if you get above that threshhold.",

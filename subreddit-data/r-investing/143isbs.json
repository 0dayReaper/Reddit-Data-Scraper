            "comment": "Stock options are often not transferable by employer rules. And it's usually pointless to do so anyway, since they will often expire.\n\nAre you sure you're talking about *options,* and not actual stock? Is your company publicly traded? Is there a reason you're not going to exercise them? When will they expire if you don't?",

About half are vested but I have not exercised them because the price of the stock is currently much lower than the strike price. \n\nThey don't expire until 60 days after I leave my current employer. \n\nIf I should exercise options, I'd likely have to ask my employer how to do so because the website to manage them is barebones and does not include a way to do anything with the shares. This would tip them off that I'm looking to leave so I need to save this until the end.",

They basically 'exist' only on paper, and only institutions that your employer has partnered with can handle the paperwork around them. There's effectively nothing to transfer. (Edit: this would also apply to the stock after exercise).\n\nIf this is a publicly traded company then there's no reason to do this. You can just buy the same stock on the open market for cheaper.\n\nCan you speak more to why you want to do this?",

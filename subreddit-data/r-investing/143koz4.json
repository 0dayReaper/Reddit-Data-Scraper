The money is fungible, if you want it to go up put it in something that is performing, and it will probably go up sooner and faster. No sense in leaving it in this mismanaged shit pile that ARK funds have become. It doesn't matter if you recoup money there or elsewhere z and there's little reason to think it's going to happen in these funds.",

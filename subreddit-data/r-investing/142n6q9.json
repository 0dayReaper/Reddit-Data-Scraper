There are no rules that say a stock that has performed well would continue to do so, and a stock that hasn't is due to perform well. Sell stocks that you think won't grow or grow the least.",

You should figure out what you want your portfolio to look like going forward, then sell whatever you need to to get there.\n\nNow, if that would lead to too large a tax bill, then you might consider selling more losers and fewer winners to adjust, but that's a secondary concern.",

There is a reason most active traders don't do so well. \n\nBecause of this I often feel that making a decision based on taxes is probably as good as any, at least for a starting point - because these are things you actually have tangible information on, then consider how your portfolio is balanced, etc.",

            "comment": "\"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\" by Burton Malkiel. Originally published in 1973 and it is now in it's 13th edition. This book has stood the test of time.\n\nThe author advocated for an index fund in its first edition before the first index fund was ever created. \n\nThis book is heavily regarded by Harry Markowitz, Merton Miller, and William Sharpe, who each received noble laureates in economic science, so the content in this book is what educated people talk about.",

    "postText": "In 2011, the US Credit Rating was downgraded by one of the agencies even though the Debt Ceiling was avoided. We are pretty much at that point.\n\nIn 2011, they avoided the default just 2 days before the 'deadline'. Just 5 days later the credit rating was downgraded.\n\nEven if we avoid a default, might we escape further downgrades or is it a foregone conclusion? I don't know how a third party could look at America and see us as the same credit risk as a month, year, or decade ago.  I feel that this risk isn't even priced in.",

China? Maybe, but nobody trusts currency without any transparency. Euro? Nope. GBP? Maybe most likely contender, along with euro, but still nope.",

You don't need to control spending to grow an economy... the periods of greatest economic expansion in American history are when the government was spending money hand-over-fist. Limiting spending to meet some arbitrary ratio or debt limit is just bad fiscal policy.\n\nAs to debt::GDP, it's something people make mouth noises about once in a while but the financial community couldn't care less about. Watch their investment patterns, not what a few might yammer about on cable news. Ratio is fine and, for the world's reserve currency, largely irrelevant.",

Inflation is the most regressive tax there is so it wouldn\u2019t affect wealthy politicians as badly and they could sort of pretend it is out of their control or just economic factors and people will buy it. It is also just easier to pass inflationary policies politically than raise taxes.\n\nHonestly I think they should put a very large tax on foreign investment, we have way more than we need and all it does is inflate asset prices and create debt. Then you put policies in place to increase wages (using the increased revenue to bear some of the expense) and hope that wages outpace inflation. It\u2019d be kind of bad for wealthy asset owners and having rampant inflation is destabilizing but if wages rise fast enough it should be okay until we get the debt down. That\u2019s probably the best path forwards for the average person.\n\nThey are putting all of this effort in to stifle wages when they\u2019ve been stagnant for so long and reduce inflation, and there are lots of deflationary forces at play that may become a really serious problem. They should probably lower interest rates back to zero, and pursue policies to increase wages and let inflation rip.  Otherwise we are just kicking the can down the road. Anyone that thinks austerity and high taxes are happening are kidding themselves, anyone with money doesn\u2019t want high taxes and anyone without money doesn\u2019t want austerity. There\u2019s 0% support among the population and you need both.",

But they need to stop pandering to these people that are making 200K per year and promising they won't raise their taxes. That's just ridiculous.\n\nAnother way to raise revenue would be to adopt more permissive immigration policies, or even actively recruit people. Canada is doing this right now. The goal is something like 10m new Canadians in 10 years. And just like the Canadians we should probably want more Americans to fill out the ranks of our aging workforce and pay taxes.  But for us it probably needs to be more like 100 million new Americans in the next 30 years. It's really hard to get that done though for the simple reason that Americans, broadly, are very suspicious of immigration.",

In the US the capital gains tax brackets are 0%, 15%, and 20% compared to the ordinary income tax brackets of 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% or 37%.  So a doctor's marginal dollar is taxed at 37% and a billionaire's marginal dollar is taxed at 20%.\n\nThe disparity gets bigger from there due to billionaires getting a much higher return than doctors to pay people to understand the tax code and build tax shelters.  As one example, instead of selling stock and paying capital gains billionaires can take out loans with the stock as collateral.  \n\nAre you from outside the US?  I'm surprised an American on r/investing is not already familiar with this.  Warren Buffett uses the example that he pays a lower percent tax than his secretary as an example for why wealthy people should be taxed more.  The revenue problem has gotten worse in the decades since he first used that example as wealth has become even more heavily concentrated.",

Because the investments are never sold, no taxes are paid on the capital gains.  The investments are passed on to your heirs.  If you need cash, you borrow against the investments.  No way rich people are paying 20% tax rates.\n\nTaxing wealth is extremely difficult to do.  The billionaires know that this is not going to happen.  So, when they say to tax them more, they know that it doesn't matter.  No matter how much you raise the tax rates, the rich still won't pay very much.",

It didn't happen when Bush or Trump were president and Democrats had the House, it happened when Republicans had the House and Obama and Biden were president. Republicans are explicitly, exclusively the ones behind this, and I expect them to push it even further next year given that severely damaging the economy could help Trump/DeSantis get elected.",

Reality is 70% of Americans realize we have a spending problem and need to cut, but the president can't spend money fast enough. There is no such thing as forgiving student loans, instead the federal government will borrow money and pay off those loans. Interest is soon going to be the number 1 expenditure of the treasury and we are out of control relative to GDP. \n\nBigger picture, we hit the debt ceiling in January, the democrats could have raised it in December when they controlled both chambers but they wanted this fight for political purposes too. I'm a conservative, most people on here are liberal. The sooner you realize both political parties are laughing at all of us the sooner we might be able to address the real problems facing us.

It was a strong arming on his part that largely blew up in his face, particularly when the Democrats eventually said said \"sure, we can include border wall funding\" and he said \"actually no, I want more.\"",

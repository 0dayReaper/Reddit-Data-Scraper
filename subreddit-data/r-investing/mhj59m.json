MSFT shot up 1% on that news, up more than 2% on the day.\n\nSome highlights from the CNBC article:\n\n&gt;\"Microsoft will deliver to the U.S. Army over 120,000 devices based on its HoloLens augmented-reality headset.\"  \n\"The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures.\"  \n\"A group of employees called on Microsoft to cancel the HoloLens contract. \u201cWe did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is used,\u201d the employees wrote in an open letter regarding the HoloLens contract.\"\n\nThoughts on this news? What do you guys think about some employees opposing the decision? All I know is Microsoft is a monster of a company. Just another reason to continue holding I guess",

People were making money off trash companies that didn\u2019t even have products or verifiable info. That run is over and a lot of stocks have plummeted back down, and new ones aren\u2019t just running for no reason anymore. For example OZSC, which he mentioned, was trading at $0.40 at some point in Jan and has since dropped all the way to $0.10\n\nThis is basically to say to anyone reading this don\u2019t get caught up in the allure of pennystocks, some people hit it big during that run but for the most part they are super risky investments and it is often difficult to even figure out what you are buying. People that push pennystocks love to suck others in by saying things like \u201c$1 EOY guaranteed\u201d and people buy in after calculating how much they could make off just a $100 investment, but almost none will ever run even close to $1\n\nUltimately I\u2019ve found it is a futile point to tell people to not fuck with penny stocks, most newer investors will dabble and learn the lesson on their own, so I\u2019ll just say follow the rules: Don\u2019t trade on margin, don\u2019t invest more than you are comfortable losing, and don\u2019t trade with money you need in the short term",

New traders are ... inexperienced and easily parted with their money. \n\nWhat I did was read r/pennystocks to see what people were talking about besides the popular tickers. Today you could do the same thing by looking at what WSB is talking about BESIDES GME &amp; AMC. \n\nThen I deployed the crazy scheme of actually reading the financial disclosures and any information I could find on those companies to see if they were bullshit or not and come up with a valuation of the company. If I found one that looked like an actual company and not a scam, make ling DD posts walking people through what the SEC filings say in English with some graphs. This increases the hype and makes people buy which raises the share price and creates more hype and FOMO buyers. If the price rises above your valuation, you sell.\n\nAnd there\u2019s nothing to feel bad about either because in my DD posts, I would say \u201cthis stock is trading at 1 cent but I think it\u2019s worth 5.\u201d If people read that and decide to buy shares from you at 6 cents, that\u2019s their problem.",

Honeywell\u2019s Industrial Electionics business has a 15x P/E, so take OZSC\u2019s (industrial electronics) earnings per share and multiply it by 15 for a conservative estimate.  Then I subtract 30% of that amount because I\u2019m a rock-chewing idiot with no business valuing companies.\n\nIf the current share price is below that price it\u2019s a good buy, if it\u2019s above that price it\u2019s not worth it. The key is to make peace with the idea that you\u2019re going to miss 90% of the rockets other people are getting on but that\u2019s ok.

So you don't usually care about what other groups are doing.\n\n * If you are building office tools to make everyone's life better, or if you are building Azure tools to support the entire internet's infrastructure, then you feel good about your conscience. You do not care about what the Ads team is doing or the what the VR team is doing.\n\n * It also allows each team to have its own culture. Some groups treat their team a 9-5 office job where family and health are just as important. Others are a tight knit family that work-hard-play-hard together. Some are in super high achieving teams where work is all that matters.\n\n * There is no common company chat to organize a proper 'people's revolt'. Google having one common place for everyone to share opinions, is a feature that has now come to bite them in their ass.\n\n\n* Second, it doesn't use activism as a means to lure top candidates.\n\n * Microsoft never said \"Don't be evil\". If anything, Ballmer and Gate's Microsoft used every legal trick in the book to get ahead. It wasn't evil, but MSFT did everything every other company did. There was no pretense of being' Holier than Thou\". This is ofc, contrasted with Google.            \n\n\n* Stubborn people don't last at Microsoft\n\n * Microsoft is a company based around collaboration, cross-team-consensus and generally being nice to fellow employees (esp. since Nadella has come in)\n\n * The type of people who cause friction are rarely promoted or incentivized to do so.\n\n* Microsoft's customers are mostly B2B and not B2C:\n\n * Really, this is the biggest difference. Businesses don't care about virtue signaling. If anything, displaying political opinions is looked down upon if your clients are businesses.\n\n * On the other hand, there is an advantage to political broadcasting, if your customers are individuals. Thus, Microsoft heavily disincentives individuals from making political statements while they represent MSFT.\n\n______________\n\nMicrosoft actually does a lot more than Google in the AI and Fairness domain. But, you will never hear about it in the news, because MSFT doesn't care about stupid readers and MSR is a far more mature organization.                             \nMSFT directly goes to the people who matter (Social organizations, healthcare) and establish B2B partnerships. Google will release it as an open-for-all tool, and then use their virtue signaling to gain traction form the ground up.",

They're owned by Brookfield.\n\nFrom their site:\n\nOaktree Capital Group, LLC\n\nOaktree Specialty Lending Corporation\n\nBrookfield Oaktree Wealth Solutions\n\nOaktree Acquisition Corporation\n\nOaktree Diversified Income Fund Inc. (ODIDX)\n\nOaktree Emerging Markets Equity Fund (OEQIX)\n\nOaktree Real Estate Income\n\nOaktree SICAV Funds\n\nOaktree Strategic Credit Fund\n\n17Capital\n\nBrookfield also several funds, tickers, and investment vehicles:\n\nBrookfield Corporation\n\nBrookfield Asset Management\n\nBrookfield Infrastructure Partners : BIP BIPC\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners : BEP BEPC\n\nBrookfield Business Partners : BBU BBUC\n\nBrookfield Reinsurance\n\nReal Estate Preferreds : BPY BPO\n\nThere are so many investment options and it's confusing. My initial goal was to invest in alternative asset classes to diversify, then I learned about Howard Marks and his philosophy. I read what he writes and would like to allocate some of my capital to his business. But I am also open to seeing what other options they offer if there's a greater return.\n\nDo you think investing in them is a good idea? why?\n\nhow are they different from other alternative investing and PE?\n\nwhat's the best way to diversify and invest in alternatives and PE?\n\nCan anybody explain what each Oaktree Capital / Brookfield fund, company, and investment vehicle is for?\n\nWhat do you think is the best way to invest in them?\n\nHow would buying Oaktree be different from buying Brookfield?",

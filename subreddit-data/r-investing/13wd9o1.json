            "comment": "Biggest drawback of hotel apartments investment in any country is annual service/maintanence/management charges which quite high. It will eat your profit.. if COVID type things happen. If no income generated,you are still liable to their charges... Which is quite High??\r  \n\r  \nBetter to buy regular apartment and give to property management company.\r  \n\r  \nWhen you want to sell hotel apartments,, it is very hard compare to regular apartment. As resell market for this type of property is iliquid.\r  \n\r  \nSome project give you guranteed return for some years.. it is bigger scam . They just inflated property price and give you your money in that period.. armature investors fell for it..\r  \n\r  \nOne more important things you have to consider that you do not have control over it in hotel apartments. If some repair work done, whatever charges they said you have to paid... Hotel apartments look good in paper.. reality it is trap. I am not against hotel apartments investment. Love it,'s no hassle investment option. It works for some people and make good profit. I consider it as high risk high returns category...",

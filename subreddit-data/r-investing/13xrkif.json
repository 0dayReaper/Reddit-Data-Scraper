    "postText": "I am starting a stocking picking contest for high school kids with the goals of getting them interested in investing and educating them (at least somewhat) about investing. A traditional stock picking contest involves participants picking one or more stocks and then basing the winner on how those stocks perform during the timeframe specified by the contest (typically 1-3 months, though this could vary). The problem with those stock picking contests is that they teach the absolute wrong lessons about investing, since the winner is typically someone who bets on high risk companies and gets lucky. (Assuming you have 100+ participants, this will always be the case.) \n\nHow could I structure such a contest to teach better lessons about investing? One obvious solution would be to extend the timeframe, but realistically I can only expect to engage them for so long. Anything extending beyond the school year is not practical, and probably nothing more than a few months. Another idea is to require a write-up on the stock and/or investment strategy and basing part of the scores on that. Could also somehow factor in volatility (historical or during the contest time window) and adjust the returns based on that.\n\nDoes anyone else have ideas on how to improve upon the contest for educational purposes? I am open to pretty much anything, though I think it probably needs to include some element of tracking their score based on the stock market performance each day.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all of the suggestions so far. Definitely some good food for thought. Importantly, I probably should have clarified that I am not a teacher. This contest is going to be sponsored by an educational non-profit and it will span across multiple school districts in partnership with the schools. I will not be teaching the kids directly, but I can provide lessons and guidance to the teachers who oversee the contest participants at their respective schools.\n\nWith that context in mind, I think this probably needs to be some sort of contest with a prize in order to engage schools and students. I don\u2019t think we could just provide lesson materials and expect it to gain any traction.",

It teaches very little.\n\nWhat about if you pick 3 companies and have the students perform a DCF model or some other model. The student should be able to defend their valuation thesis based on the last few earnings reports and management guidance. And then they can estimate the company's potential future revenues, debt, and income in the next quarter. \n\nI assume you are familiar with the resources provided by the SEC and FDIC already.\n\n[https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/money-smart/teach-money-smart/money-smart-for-young-people/grades-9-12.html](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/money-smart/teach-money-smart/money-smart-for-young-people/grades-9-12.html) \n\n[https://www.investor.gov/teachers/curriculum](https://www.investor.gov/teachers/curriculum)",

The kids need to buy in to the contest or they won't care.\n\nI say let everyone pick a few stocks that they want to follow, for whatever reason they want. They could put together a short presentation on their investment thesis. You'd be surprised how \"in the know\" young kids are about consumer trends. Revisit their picks at the end of the semester, and have them report back on their results. In between, you can teach them the basics and hopefully they catch the \"personal finance\" bug.\n\nRemember that personal finance tends to go in one ear and out the other for kids. Let them lose fake money and learn from their mistakes, or learn what they got right.",

Balance sheet /PnL maybe have them calculate the basic financial ratios\n2. Rev/Earnings, Rev/earnings growth , margin , free cash flow \n3. outlook (risks / opportunities )\n4. future outlook goo/bad\n\nI would love to pick some popular meme stock and say why its a bad investment",

Traditionally stock picking rewards picking the riskiest thing since there is no downside. This encourages more thoughtful analysis of market conditions, whatever. The results will almost certainly be based on luck but at least its having them focus on more relevant factors.",

I would say instead, have an introduction week where they decide which stock to pick and write a reason why and a thesis for their investment. Then maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the semester, an update must be written based on events that occur to their stock throughout the semester that the students could write about, whether or not it affects their thesis positively, negatively, or neutral, and hoe they are now going to adjust their investment approach.\n\nAt the end, yeah; give a shout out to whoever performed best, but make the actual grading based on substantiation of research and thesis based on critical thinking, even if it ends up being wrong.",

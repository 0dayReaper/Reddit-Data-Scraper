    "postText": "Another post with a similar title reminded me of my own related question.  But the other post is about the returns of passive investing declining when too many people are doing it.\n\nI have a different question, about significant developments that are maybe unlikely but not unimaginable.  Something along the lines of changes to the legal system that erode the rights of minority shareholders, removing their capacity to address corrupt or incompetent management.\n\nIf I could get in a question at a Berkshire annual meeting, it would be, \u201cMany people (myself included) index in part due to your endorsement of it.  It\u2019s pretty convenient because we don\u2019t have to think about it, and in some ways we\u2019re better off if we don\u2019t. But I think it would be a mistake to not think about it at all.  What are the most conceivable scenarios that *could* arise that would render indexing a more questionable approach?\u201d",

There are so many people and organizations for which those two words basically sums up the best option available.  The examples above name conditions under which that heuristic wouldn\u2019t be strong at all.\n\nBut it is somewhat obvious that indexing won\u2019t work so well in dysfunctional or poorly developed markets.  I\u2019m more interested in hypothetical developments that could undermine the thesis for index investing even in functional markets.  I don\u2019t know what those might be, but someone who knows more about the subject than me might.  In the same way that a mathematician would be able to identify scenarios in which some almost-always-reasonable method of approximation will fail to produce reasonable answers.",

How do you KNOW if the market had a good day or bad day?  You measure it.  With what?  **Indexes**.  That is, by definition, what an index IS and DOES -- it's not \"magic\" of some kind. \n\nSo then, how does that process \"stop working\"?\n\n----\n\nBy the Way, this is a very interesting discussion, even if you haven't convinced -me- yet.

Does the management of the passive index fund automatically get your proxy?\n\nThis reminds me of a concern raised by Bogle in one of his last articles: With industry consolidation, more and more assets end up under the management of fewer and fewer index funds.  Which concentrates decision-making power.  Maybe that would have been a better example of a fundamental change to the lay of the land that might specifically impact index investors.\n\nBut again, I\u2019m not arguing that this development undermines the thesis for indexing.  I\u2019m not knowledgable on this stuff.  I\u2019m just fishing for ideas of situations along these lines that actually would undermine it.",

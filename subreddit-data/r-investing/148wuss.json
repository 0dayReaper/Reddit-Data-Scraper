If this was a month ago you would have missed out on a 5.75% gain if you waited.\n\nThere is no way to be sure you do it right, but if your idea is to put money in VOO for the longterm, then get to it and put money in VOO for the longterm.  \n\nTomorrow is a non standard day where thre is a foreseeable event that could lead to market turbulence in the Feds action ad Powell speech, but there is no reason to, as of this momemt, not to assume you can't put it in after his speech tomorrow.  If it makes you feel better to do half tomorrow and half Friday, fine, basically the same thing but if it helps your brain, do it.  But don't \"wait\" for some mythical time in the future when you will know for sure it is the right time to make your longterm investment.",

The only thing I was annoyed was that, dang, of course, I gotta be the unlucky one \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02.\n\nUltimately, whether you DCA or lump sum, since you'll be doing it long term, whether it goes up or down, you'll be recuperating the benefits. If you worry about things alot, perhaps DCA. If you are a regretter, then perhaps DCA. If you're a regretter, but think you'll manage, then perhaps a combination of DCA/lump summing. If you just want to get it over with and start, then lump sum. Ultimately, it's up to you to feel good about your decision.",

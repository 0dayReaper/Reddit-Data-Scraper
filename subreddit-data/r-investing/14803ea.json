    "postText": "I recently learned that there is an option to take a loan of up to $50,000 from your 401k. You pay interest on it, but the interest goes into your own account. \n\nMy question is why is this not a more commonly used loan to do things like (for example) buying a car so that any interest paid goes to you, rather than to a bank? Especially if you are allowed to continue to pay into the 401k while the loan is outstanding. \n\nWhen you search 401k loans the info on Fidelity and Schwab makes these seem like a bad idea, just wondering what I\u2019m missing.",

That's the only math that counts, unless I'm missing something.",

If you\u2019re going to lose out on compounded interest over years the math favors a traditional loan at lower percentages than a 403b or 401k loan. If you pay it back early and just need some cash like for a few months then the loan on the retirement is best especially during choppy times of growth and higher interest rates this is the obvious winner",

Definitely not for car loans. It is like you are digging your grave!\n\n1) Other than recent corrections, market is bullish for many years. When you take 401k loan 50k, and then pay it off 5 years, you will benefit 3.75% or 4% or even 5% (now) from your payment. If you invest in SPY or VOO funds, you may gain double of that.\n\n2) like Others stated, if you lose job or move company, you need to pay back full or pay IRS penalty. This is waste.\n\n3) For most of the people, 401k is the nest egg for retirement, they must grow the funds gradually with \"Power of compounding at 8% or more\" so that they can comfortably retired.\n\nI took 401k loan  when I needed down payment for primary home purchase (Short sale from bank) during 2011, as a short term cash, and **paid it within 3-4 months**. Hindsight, it is a great move as It helped me get a permanent place to stay.\n\nNever take that loan unless it is emergency or exceptionally good deal.",

It seemed likely to be another one of the many viruses that don't end up becoming a serious worldwide problem ( ebola, etc). I don't understand how people can claim it was so obvious to profit from covid when so few professional traders profited from it.\n\n My guess is that most of the people that \"correctly\" thought the sky was falling when they first heard of covid, also thought the sky was falling on most other epidemics that never went global. Kind of like how economists have predicted 12 of the last 2 recessions.",

So if you have money, but have some temporary cash flow problems (like a house down payment), it's a very good resource. If you don't have the money to repay it within a year, it's probably not a good idea.",

So tell me where did double taxation happen? You took 10 dollars out, used whole 10 dollars, then put 10 dollars back in. Not a single cent got taxed here (if we don't count the interest you pay in addition to 10 dollars when you pay them back).\n\nYou would be double taxed if you took 10 dollars as loan, paid tax on it, leaving you with 7 dollars to spend, and then had to pay back 10 dollars. But that's not the case",

Then when you retire and withdraw the funds as intended, the funds are taxed as income.\n\nThis is deceptive, because you're not accounting for the fact that the loan was originally pre-tax, and was given to you without having to pay any taxes. You effectively turned pre-tax dollars into post-tax dollars for free when you took the loan. Paying back the loan with post-tax dollars just evens things back out. Then when you retire, you're just paying the taxes you would have paid whether or not you took the loan. You're not being double taxed.\n\nTo look at this another way, imagine that you take out the 401(k) loan, then immediately pay it back 100% the next day, using after-tax dollars from your bank account. You would be in the exact same situation as you were in before you took the loan.",

I definitely would never do it for the purpose of a car loan (a car loan is going to have a lower interest rate than the expected market return anyway), but there are cases where it can help you in the long run. Helping you cover a down payment on a house to avoid an FHA loan and PMI could result in you paying less monthly for both the mortgage and the loan payback.\n\nUsing it to buy a car is a very bad idea, unless you have absolutely no other money, can't get a loan, and need a car to survive. Car loans are as close to free money as you can get anymore. They used to be as low as 0%, but 4-5% is pretty common anymore, and even that is going to be a better deal than losing out on market gains. \n\nDo the math yourself - if you take out a 401k loan instead of a traditional car loan and scale that out over the same period - let's say you went with a 3 year 401k loan vs a 3 year car loan - you will always end up worse off with the 401k loan, directly proportional to the amount you took out. \n\nExample of $20,000 loan:\n\n3-year car loan with 0 down @ 5%, you will pay about $1500 in interest at the end of the loan. You \"lose\" $1500 in this scenario.\n\n\n3-year 401k loan @ 10% YoY return, you will miss out on about $3200 in gains. You \"lose\" $3200 in this scenario.\n\n\nIn reality it won't be that bad, because you will be getting gains proportional to how much principal you've paid back, but you can clearly see how the 401k loan for a car is not a smart move.",

            "comment": "\r  \nWhile it may seem appealing to borrow from your 401(k) and pay interest to yourself, there are several reasons why 401(k) loans are not more popular:\r  \n\r  \nLimited borrowing capacity: 401(k) loans are subject to certain limitations. The maximum amount you can borrow is typically limited to either $50,000 or 50% of your vested account balance, whichever is less. This may not be sufficient for larger purchases, such as buying a car or a home.\r  \n\r  \nPotential for loss of retirement savings: When you take a loan from your 401(k), the borrowed amount is temporarily removed from your investments. This means you miss out on potential growth and compounding of those funds. If the market performs well during the loan period, you may miss out on significant gains.\r  \n\r  \nRepayment requirements and risks: 401(k) loans usually require regular repayments within a specific time frame, often five years. If you fail to repay the loan as scheduled or leave your job before repaying the loan, it may be considered a distribution. This can lead to taxes, penalties, and potential loss of retirement savings.\r  \n\r  \nInterest and fees: While the interest paid on a 401(k) loan does go back into your own account, it's important to note that the interest is typically not tax-deductible. Additionally, some 401(k) plans charge origination fees or administrative fees for loan processing, which can eat into your potential savings.\r  \n\r  \nRetirement savings disruption: Taking a loan from your 401(k) can disrupt your retirement savings plan. By removing funds from your account, you may not be able to achieve your long-term retirement goals. It's important to consider the long-term impact on your financial well-being before deciding to take a loan.\r  \n\r  \nWhile there can be situations where a 401(k) loan may make sense, such as in cases of financial hardship, it's generally advisable to explore other loan options first, such as traditional bank loans or financing through other means. It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances and goals.",

Life insurance is typically the better option since the rates are low (around 6% for mine) and you continue to earn on your policy (mine is about 4.5%).

            "comment": "I took a 401k loan just once.  It was a small bit to cover some extra closing costs on a new home purchase when I was tight on cashflow at that time.  I think the 401k provider allowed me to specify some details about the loan, like a few durations to repay it over.  3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, etc.  Seemed great, and lets say I chose 2 years.   This is not a long time for a loan, but had a manageable monthly payment.\n\nI quickly realized the catch-- it wouldn't allow me to contribute to the 401k while making payments toward the loan.   This meant I would also miss out on any company match until I was able to contribute.   So that \"manageable\" monthly payment spread out over a couple years needed to be paid off ASAP, which was more inconvenient than expected.\n\nI think I paid it off in 4-6 months, putting everything I could toward it.  And then I resumed the 401k contributions.  Overall I'm pretty sure I contributed less to 401k that year than usual.  So yes, it did slow my savings, for the sake of accessing money.",

The interest makes a small difference too, but the main effect is really just that you're not invested in stocks (missing out on potential growth - or loss) while you need the cash.\n\nIt can be appropriate in some situations and may be a better option than other loan alternatives (like credit cards). Just ask yourself, would you sell stocks (in taxable brokerage account) to raise cash - if yes, 401k loan basically does the same thing.",

I now own ABBV at an avg cost of $82 and some other sticks. I sell CC against them, collect dividends and have owned them long term to reduced my tax liability when cashed out. I pay 4.5% back on my repayment.",

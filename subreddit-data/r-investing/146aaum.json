    "postText": "A while back someone via reddit contacted me via chat and we started talking. I was of course apprehensive because I did not initiate the contact. Very quickly into the conversation, she unprompted sent me a picture of herself. Very attractive Asian woman, but an appropriate picture, not xxx rated. I initially thought it was a bot but still don't think it was. She kept trying to get me to use WhatsApp. Before I could even think of downloading the app, her acct was either banned or deleted.\n\nFast forward months later:\nI received a text message from someone asking for another person. I replied back she had the wrong number and person. She then continued the conversation for some reason and once again, unprompted, sent a G Rated photo. Once again, a very attractive Asian woman.\nOut of nothing but boredom I continued the conversation. She then wanted to continue on WhatsApp. Once again I was bored so I tried the app. I point blank asked if she was selling something or doing onlyfans or something. She got offended. I still continued the conversation.\n\nAs far as I can tell, she's not a bot. I think I would notice. However, it's clear that there's about to be a scam going on. What can I expect?",

Don't even bother starting to engage with them, attractive young ladies are not messaging random accounts.",

He said no she/he said Fuck You that\u2019s an exact quote. So not interested in anything but getting your money stop the convo now and play it safe.",

It\u2019s odd to hear \u201cshe sent me a picture of herself\u201d, when in fact they just sent you a picture of an attractive Asian woman. It could be anyone, off google search. Then they assume the role of that person.  For someone that wants to believe an attractive Asian person on Reddit is randomly contacting them, and has no internet experience and is maybe a little naive, this may actually work. \n\nImagine they are contacting hundreds of people. A bot may initiate by scraping forum usernames, maybe some random guys anywhere in the world do the hook and lure follow ups.  Maybe some eventually send money. \n\nAssume all DM contacts on Reddit are a scam. I\u2019ve never had an inclination to DM anyone outside a comment thread and most people don\u2019t, unless they want to initiate a scam in private.",

If she found you on investment or stock sub she is either looking a sugar daddy, or green card provider. I also get from a local Indian Google software engineer. She wanted to view my face on Whatsapp.  Both I declined. This one looks like looking for a boy friend w/ a big wallet.",

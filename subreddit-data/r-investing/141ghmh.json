    "postText": "My dad works for this company. He is not into investing or the buesiness decisions. He does safety checks and compliance checks - his climbing days are over. Although many of these towers have escalators. He sounded like a little kid telling me about them, I never really asked before. He was very informative about everything I asked. \n\nI was picking his brain about this company when he mentioned \"were upgrading to 6g towers - right after everyone freaked out about 5g.\" All i heard was CHA CHING. All the things I asked him - what they do, what theyve done, what theyre going to do, etc... he easily explained and the way he described matched up to what their information shows. Theyve been slow for a couple years and are about to get crazy busy with upgrading. They offer cellular reception to big wireless companies. They rent land from property owners but own the towers. They are global. He mentioned crown castle (cci) as a competitor. \n\nWould love to hear thoughts about this company and the future of 6g... I'm pretty excited to have bought a couple shares during their lowest time.",

Again maybe this is common or maybe its common to be that heavily leveraged for the industry but first again that would be my biggest worry  after only 10 min or research and I may not know what I am talking about.",

My dad did say \"we'll see how it goes. It'll take off or tank\" and he laughed. He is a lower level foreman, he doesnt have any pull or secret info. \n\nIm curious if 6g is because of EVs progressing or what the reason would be to upgrade another gig. Maybe to create more work from slowing down lol like you said, a marketing term to create upgrades.\n\nMy friends mom is a landlord, she owns around 18 homes and a couple apartments. She says she takes loans out on her homes to buy more home and write off interest. I think real estate burries themselves in debt often. I will look into the shares buyback more. I didn't even know they were a real estate company until I briefly checked them out. I never asked him much about his job. I thought he did repairs and maintenance on cell towers - which is his position but not the entirety of the company.",

You put 200k down , take a loan out for 800k and pay 1 million for the apt building\n\nSo now you have a 1 million dollar asset and you have 800k of debt. So yes even though you have a lot of debt you have a lot of assets too. I mean even if you put zero down you should in theory have\n\n1 million asset (apt building)\n\n1 million debt (loan)\n\nLook at SBAC balance sheet .\n\ntotal assets 10.5 billion\n\ntotal debt 12.8 billion\n\ntotal liabilities 15.8 billion \n\nNow part of this is just accounting and them taking depreciation on assets but it still sort of illustrates the issue of their debt. I would really have to dig in to get an understanding of this.\n\nHowever compare it to CCI \n\ntotal assets 39 billion \n\ntotal debt 21 billion \n\ntotal liabilities 31 billion",

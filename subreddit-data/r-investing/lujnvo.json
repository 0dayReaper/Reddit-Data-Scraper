    "postText": "[S&amp;P 500 Since 1950 - 7 crashes](https://www.tradingview.com/x/v3WOgbWL/)\n\n\nHi guys just wanted to put things in perspective for you all since some of you seem to be quite nervous with the recent week of stock movement. \n\nI've summarised a list all stock market crashes since 1950. There has been 7 stock market crashes since 1950, averaging one every 10 years. \n\nThe stock market crashes ranges from inflation (10%+), to oil price rises (4x) due to war, dot com bubble, housing market collapse, covid-19 etc.\n\nThe graph is a log graph meaning that the space changes are proportional to the percentage change. This is useful for looking at long term charts since the % change for a dollar increase is smaller as the index value goes up.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 has averaged a compound annual growth rate of 8.22% since 1950. This is illustrated by the trend lines, and as you can see the S&amp;P 500 is trading right in the middle of the range (the two blue trend lines). \n\nI noted a few reasons in the box for each crash for a brief understanding of why it had happened. Note, that the only one with a 'fear of overvaluation' was only the dotcom crash where the PE's were over 200 and many companies were just cash burning shells with massive negative free cash flows.\n\nI'm not saying a crash / correction won't happen, but i just wanted to put things into perspective and give a bigger picture of the overall stock market since pretty much before all of us were born. \n\nBy no means am i an economist but I didn't include anything earlier than 1950s because that was pre WW2/WW1 - before the US was a superpower / the global financial hub / USD = world trade currency etc.\n\nEdit: some of you noted that its only 8.22% if you bought at the start but I want to clarify that yes and no! Yes for the people that literally buy in once once at the beginning of 1950.\n\nNo because if you buy throughout the years (DCA every month let's say) you'll buy within the range - both lower and higher range! So it's more or less 8%! For example during 1960s-1980s the sp500 traded sideways! So if you constantly bought in those 20 years, the accumulation of money in this period would have a higher CAGR of &gt; 8% because of where it is in the range. Just follow the lines! It makes it easier. There's roughly same amount of periods above and below the middle trend line.\n\nEdit: Changed enron scandal to lehman brothers as some pointed out my mistake.\n\nEdit: Further Log Graph explanation (why log is preferred) If the scale has a large range (i.e. 100 to 3000) then log should be used because its important to show the % changes as opposed to the point changes. A 1 point increase in the SP500 now is only 1/3811 = 0.02% whereas a 1 point increase 10 years ago was 1/1000= 0.1%. It's important to look at it in terms of % change because companies grow in terms of % as well. For example you don't quote apple has grown its business by 30 billion this year ( random number), instead you say apple grew its sales by 20% this year. Its so that its comparable.",

Quarterly results from companies, quarterly analysis of manager performance. A classic trope is \"I'm a long term investor... One quarter at a time\"\n\nI've beaten the market handily the last couple of year due to a few interesting ideas. Let's take a random, maybe even unrealistic (yet simple) example - when Nadella gets hired at MSFT - you start to believe in his plan/vision for the turnaround and you shifted your portfolio go 90% SPY and 10% MSFT and held (maybe periodic rebalancing) - congrats you beat the market over the last few years with similar risk measures\n\nSo while i would recommend to everyone to index most of your $$$, if you happen to have a few long term convictions, play them. It can make a difference. Just don't go balls deep.",

Avoid investing in life experiences that are \"NSFW\". I definitely don't recommend investing in drugs but if you must, focus on investment-grade alcohol (collectible wines,  scotch, cognacs, etc). Invest the money and time now to learn to play golf, it's a de-facto required skill for many corporate upper-management and high-paying sales jobs. Take a skydiving or scuba-diving course or a low-budget overseas trip so you have something memorable to say when job interviewers ask \"tell me about your biggest challenge?\". The relatively small amounts invested in these types of things will beat any long term returns you get from the same small amounts invested in the markets.",

The difference is the Fed and other stimulus packages have pumped the market up so much quicker than we've ever seen in history.  This isn't due to the market, this is due to the Fed.  It's abnormal for sure, but adjusting for that, 2020 is a kind of recession.",

When the market gets a new way to trade or a new form of information, early adopters can \"exploit\" this new mechanic to get an edge, then everyone else sees what is happening and we rebalance to a new stable normal. The mechanic doesn't just go away.\n\nThere are many investment companies vying for that new edge, controlling massive pools of wealth. If individual retail investors are all chasing past performance and piling into predictable funds or stocks, the hedge funds and AI systems will see this and exploit it ... it quickly rebalances and becomes unexploitable.\n\nFor example, let's say that in today's market a stock price will jump when it joins the SP500. If that is true, then the fundies and savvy investors will be heavily investing in growth companies in the 501-550 range to try to capture this jump. This heavy investment in 501-550 raises thier prices, eliminating the big jump. The market is now rebalanced, the \"exploit\" is smoothed over. ...maybe that's what you mean by the mechanic disappearing?",

Any time you have a downturn like this there are larger then normal opportunities for investment if you have the money to do it. I imagine a lot of people on this sub made a lot of money in the last year. \n\nThat\u2019s not wrong, or dirty or anything else. \n\nBut many who lost their job and aren\u2019t invested in the market are in far worse shape. The stimulus helps but you can\u2019t hand out enough money to bring people back up to the level of financial security they would have had if covid hadn\u2019t happened. It\u2019s hurt the lowest earners the most, and will continue to for years to come I imagine. Same with regards to education of all ages. Remote learning is better then no learning but every study I have read points to students underperforming in person learning by a dramatic amount. I expect the psychological impact is going to end up being even higher in the long run in terms of delayed development of social and emotional aspects of children. \n\nAll of which makes me cringe at the lockdowns that some states have imposed. The two I have followed fairly closely are CA and FL. Florida has largely remained open throughout all of covid and k-12 has been in person since late last year while CA has been the most locked down of any state in the US. Yet in terms of virus numbers CA has had more cases then Florida per 100k residents and while the death rate in CA is a little lower it\u2019s not by that much. \n\nI expect when it\u2019s all said and done we are going to look back and say that the states that locked down paid a price far, far higher then most even imagined as possible while places like Florida had slightly more covid deaths but created far less inequality and damage in the long run. Florida also has the second highest percentage of population in the US over 65 so their covid deaths being a little higher then CA actually makes sense and isn\u2019t necessarily indicative of their strategy \u201cactually\u201d resulting in more deaths since we know that older populations have a higher mortality rate. \n\nIMO if you look at the actual data which the cdc website does a good job of providing it\u2019s hard to argue with the numbers Florida has been able to put up while largely remaining open. I\u2019m going to be watching closely over the next few years what the difference is between the poverty and inequality gaps of Florida residents vs CA. I suspect the difference is going to be stark. \n\nIn terms of a solution the only one I know of is to vaccinate as many people as possible as fast as possible and get people back to work and their \u201cnormal\u201d way of life. It\u2019s going to be a long and slow road back financially though for many of the lowest income earners and I honestly don\u2019t see any feasible way to \u201cfix\u201d it. A min wage increase has been talked about but a dramatic raise there seems like it will just throw gas on the inflation fire we are all already looking at which again will hurt low income worse then high income since more of their earnings go to pay for the basic necessities like food and housing that will bear the brunt of the inflation spike.",

California and Florida have different populations, health care systems, societal norms, etc. They're 2700 miles apart.\n\nImposing restrictions that prevent people from congregating in close spaces reduces transmission of the virus. Of course it does - every medical professional worth their degree has been saying this. Imagine how Florida or California death rates would look if their policies were reversed. They wouldn't be the same.\n\nNone of this is to say that California did the right thing. I don't envy any politician that has to balance the health and economic impacts of the virus.

States that real lockdowns didn't do it just to fuck over people even if some mentally deficient people claim so. They did so out of necessity and we know, for a fact, that more socializing means more virus spread and more deaths as well as *long term health effects*. Death is the cheap price, affects only the old/fat and is quickly handled. Having people of working age get log term health issues is the real economic blowback of covid, lessened workforce.\n\n\n\nAnd let's be honest you don't have to guess at the effects of lock down since the facts are there. Only the facts don't correlate with your *feelings* but if we pretend this is /r/Investing and not /r/Conspiracy *facts should matter more then political agendas or feelings*. Sweden had no lock down, Norway/Finland/Denmark did. The economical blowback was *very much the same despite Sweden being open* while the death toll was much higher.\n\n\n\nQuite easy, a *deadly pandemic* is raging even if you don't like it. A pandemic that could easily affect your health long term and make you unable to work normally. That's why businesses suffer, because people *don't went to risk exposure. They don't go out even if it's allowed*. Smart buisness owners adapt and move online, those unfit to adapt go under. Once people are vaccinated they can reclaim the streets but not before (China, Australia, New Zeeland had strict locks own and minimal negative consequences. Sweden had no lock down, USA/UK fumbled and all suffered both disease and economic pullback). Those are the *cold hard facts, like it or not*.",

I've always done minimal in individual stocks, so I'm still mainly in mutual funds.\n\nI rebalanced the end of December and probably went a little more aggressive than I should have for my life stage.  I ended up making $200,000 in January and then losing $100,000 in February.  That $100,000 loss was painful, even though I'm up $100,000 for the year, because I was looking ahead to being at an \"easy\" retirement number in 12-18 months.\n\nBut when I really sat back and analyzed it, I'm basically at a retirement number.  Even with the $100,000 pull back, I could retire today and live comfortably with a 4% annual withdrawal.  But taking 5% would make things better, so I'd like to see things continue to grow over the next couple years so that 4% number will work long term.\n\nSo seeing those losses in February (and, really, the $100,000 loss came primarily in 2 non-consecutive days) made me realize that I was overly aggressive, so I rebalanced again last week into a slightly more conservative allocation.  \n\nWhen I'm basically already at my number, I'm okay with a 5% or 10% drop, but if that drop comes in one or two days, it does start getting me nervous.  So with my new allocation, I shouldn't have to worry about those kind of daily moves unless the market completely collapses.  But I'm also unlike to see another +$200,000 month like January - but I'm okay with that, because I don't need it.",

While banks had to fork of a couple of $Bills to him, it was pretty insignificant in the overall scheme of things.\n\nI think what the chart does a great job of showing is these things happen, over and over again.

            "comment": "Stock markets have historically gone up exponentially. So, the saying that stocks only go up is pretty much true. There's a huge cost to not being in the market over long periods of time\n\nWith the development of AI, we are on our way toward another bubble similar to the dotcom bubble. Things like autonomous truck will have incredible market value, and the initial hype surrounding such sectors will be even higher than what their value will be. AI will affect almost all sectors of the economy, it'll be a huge transformation. Note that when we'll be at the top of the bubble, the AI sector won't be at its peek of maturity. Financial markets will always precedes the real economy, because they are based on expectations(https://i.imgur.com/VtiDM8j.png). \n\nTo aide the bubble formation will be the nonsensical 2% inflation targets that's obsessing Jerome Powell. When there is a lot of technological driven deflation, like there has been in the last few decades, prices are meant to go lower. If you don't account for that type of natural deflation, you're going to create too much money in your crusade to reach a 2% inflation target. This is what's happening, and this is why assets are inflating more than consumer goods. This is going to continue because Jerome Powell is totally clueless. The continuation of this policy will give ammunition to the bubble formation.\n\nMichael Burry is right about the huge upcoming inflation of assets. Cathy Woods is right that the bubble stocks are just starting to grow. Jerome is wrong about seeking more inflation.\n\nWe aren't yet in a bubble, but it'll come in the next few years. This is my prevision. https://i.imgur.com/kYhDi6Y.png",

If I put my X dollars into it, either way I come out with X/2 after the drop.

            "comment": "Looking at the long term charts of indexes, long term companies, etc, it felt like we were due for one, and then corona accelerated it. If you recall, for several years before COVID, there was talk of an economic collapse and recession. The factors discussed them still are around now: high wealth disparity, low wages for the majority of people, inequitable access, etc etc. COVID has acted as a great amplifier of issues we face as a society and indeed caused an economic crash. \n\nHowever, the stock market has recovered *and then* some. This is because during COVID, those with means have been able to accumulate an *additional* $4,300,000,000,000. Indeed, those who were already in a good position prior to COVID were able to take advantage of the crash, face almost zero of the difficulties presented by COVID, and increase their wealth advantage even further.\n\nHowever, no long term issues have been addressed in the economy. They've become even more divisive somehow.\n\nThe economy *appears* to be humming, but long term stock heads are lamenting the fact that almost nothing seems based on fundamentals right now. It's a lot of hype. Expected increases in revenue are already priced into many stocks.\n\nI think COVID has delayed the inevitable recession that we were facing. Going back to the long term macro outlook, our economy was due for one. We are now in an artificial bull market, and people will be able to make money for some time here if they are smart about taking returns when they see them. However, inevitably the little guys will get screwed again because most won't be able to time the market crash when it does happen.",

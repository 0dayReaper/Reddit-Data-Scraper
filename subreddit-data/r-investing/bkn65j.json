                    "comment": "2008 was such a tremendous issue of localized systemic risk, that if you had let more banks die, the entire financial system would have crumbled. It\u2019s true. If you wanted it to crumble, then that\u2019s fine, but if you didn\u2019t, then the bailout was basically required. \n\nConsider the complexity of the modern financial systems. Banks exist to sell clients to products and they are constantly trading with other banks and customers. Their book is monstrous. \n\nGoldman is owed money from DB who\u2019s owed money by Citigroup. It\u2019s a chain-reaction and it was a massive, massive problem. Once one bank went down, they all got weaker. Couple that with the failure of AIG and the systemic risk is just insane. \n\nBanking is sadly a wildly important institution and simply cannot fail. If we could start from the beginning it would have been better to not let things get like this. This is why hedge funds are a good thing. They allow risk to be delocalized. They take the other sides of trades with banks. Banks can hedge their risks now, without having to trade with other banks. \n\nI think banking should not be seen as an enterprise for absurd profits. It shouldn\u2019t be nationalized either. Profit seeking incentivizes taking huge risks and the downside of these Risks is pushed down to the tax payer. Long story short, if you want to get rich, don\u2019t work for the banks.",

Just because his decisions made the company extremely profitable during his tenure, they also put the company in a position to be exposed in a liquidity crisis. Becoming a major financier is great when credit risk is low because everyone is doing ok. But turning your industrial giant into an industrial giant/corporate lender exposed GE to the credit risk of smaller, less stable companies. And that's what ended up fucking GE over during the financial crisis. So yeah, Welch deserves some of the blame.",

If you want someone to steer your company in the right direction, it's likely you'll have to pay out the ass for them, because your competitors certainly will.\n\nAlso, these contracts with golden parachutes are negotiated ahead of time, such that if those provisions weren't included, they might not get the candidate they want.\n\nIs it right? Is it fair? I suppose that depends on your personal definition of those terms. But it's just how the market is.",

A lot of bank activities create implicit liabilities (guarantors, custodians, asset servicing, revolving credit, derivative counterpartying, reverse repo) so mass failures would shred the balance sheets of businesses on the other side of those contracts. Also, mass forced sales in a low liquidity environment would have impaired the purchasing power of acquiring banks because of the shared environment. That opens up a separate thread about the knock on effects of repricing your balance sheet to force sale prices.",

If companies like AIG, the largest insurer in America, went under, a lot of shit hits the fan.\n\nMeasures like Dodd-Frank were passed after \u201808 to identify and regulate \u201csystemically important institutions\u201d (SIU\u2019s). The US would identify a vital institutions that would generally receive a bailout, and apply regulations and oversight to prevent the moral hazard that bailouts present in economics.\n\nHowever, companies, importantly MetLife Insurance (Snoopy), have won legal challenges to being labeled SIU. As a result, they get to avoid the oversight of Dodd Frank, and another way we are at risk of repeating 2008.\n\nRemember, the reason 2008 was not a Depression was because of government response measures, including bailouts. Unfortunately in the status quo, the massive debt hole America is in plus major reductions in tax revenue mean we are ill-equipped to prevent another recession from bottoming-out. \n\nSo I agree with Buffet\u2019s statement but we do need economic tools like bailouts to prevent 1929 from happening again. \n\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/opinions/tax-and-spending-legislation-disarms-us-against-next-recession/\n\n\u201cTax and spending legislation disarms us against next recession\u201d Brookings Institute",

Now that he\u2019s near the end of his career he has plenty of money, so he tries to lock in a legacy of being \u201cthe folksy billionaire of the people\u201d with nonsense like this \u2014 despite the fact that he was silent when bailouts happened during his life, and has already benefited disproportionately from the system he is now criticizing. Ridiculous.\n\nConvenient he goes for these distraction headlines when his own underperformance for the last 15 years was hitting the lime light. Looks like he has more in common with Trump than he might care to admit...",

It's also a crazy moral hazard -- consider the slippery slope of going after employee's loved ones for their actions, not to mention when those actions are simply how their employer performed during a financial crisis.",

Prior to this, many investment banks like Goldman were private partnerships, meaning that if the bank failed, it would be the partner's own money that they lost. After their IPOs, banks started taking far bigger risks as they essentially were playing with other people's money.\n\nA more interesting and realistic debate would be whether investment banks should be forced to revert back to being private entities as to prevent excessive risk taking, rather than discussing whether we should completely remove the idea of limited liability in publicly traded companies for a subset of companies that being investment banks (something that could potentially have significant implications on on personal rights and would likely not ever be done)",

And they bought them in bulk. \n\nSo let's just take Deutsche Bank for example. Deutsche goes to all the sub prime originators and says \"we're willing to buy from you any mortgages that have the following parameters - debt to income of X, loan to value of Y, employment history of Z etc...\" \n\nSo Deutsche would buy say a billion dollars of mortgages within those parameters, but on the day it bought them, it bought them blind. They have no idea what's in the files right? But they can't just securitize the mortgages and sell them to investors with a prospectus saying \"we have no clue what this is\". So they have to do due diligence. But the problem is it's cost prohibitive to do due diligence on tens of billions of dollars worth of mortgages in house. \n\nSo every bank that was in the securitization business literally hired the same due diligence firm to do their mortgages. They were called Clayton Mortgages. And they would give them the following instructions. \"Pull a statistically significant portion of the mortgages from the file, and tell us the percentage of them that are outside of our underwriting parameters\". \n\nSo starting in 2005-2006, when you'll remember the underwriting got really bad, the reports started reflecting that. I mean we're talking 30, 40, or 50 percent of the mortgages were no good. \n\nSo the banks would have the contractual right to send back all the mortgages that didn't fit in their underwriting parameters to the loan originators. So say theres a billion dollar file. Clayton does the due diligence with the amount of mortgages that the law required them to study, Duetsche gets the report and returns the mortgages that don't meet their parameters, then Standard and Poor's and Moody's would get the report from Clayton and rate the 'cleaned up' file and rate it what it was with the data they had been given, and Deutsche would sell the bond. As you can see, the issue was with the regulatory requirements of the due diligence. There was no criminal fraud.",

If you punish the CEO, no one would accept the job for a bank in trouble, it would be too risky. No or poor leadership would just make sure it would go bankrupt.\n\nPunishing the CEO does nothing. If the bank fail in USA the controlling shareholder still keeps in his pocket the proceeds of years of reckless lending. This creates moral hazard. Punishing him is the best way.

If Buffett's proposal was enacted lending by banks would be severely curtailed and there'd be complaints to Congress. Maybe MMT-type policies would be needed or something else where money is given directly to the people. The outcome would ultimately be the same; malinvestments, bubbles, crashes and bailouts from the Fed. The only fix is hard money which can't be created out of thin air like fiat currency can. Buffett seems to be hating on the players when he should be smart enough to understand that the game is the problem.",

If the spouse was already wealthy when they married (or made a bunch of money completely on the side) , for example,  taking that money could not be viewed as fair.   (yes it would be an accounting nightmare, but fair is fair)",

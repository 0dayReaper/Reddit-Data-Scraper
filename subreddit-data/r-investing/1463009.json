    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI need to invest some money for an year starting from today. I'll be needing the money after an year so I can't focus on long term investing right now. What are some good options for me? I have already put some money in NVDA, TSLA, AMD. What other options make the best fit for me? ETFs? QQQ? Thanks!\n\nOpen to all kind of ideas &amp; suggestions.",

The poster you responded to is right: you should have left with a basic idea of how risk works in the stock and bond markets, as they are the main ways companies raise capital.\n\nThat you are even considering gambling with imdividual stocks on a 1 year horizon means you've not understood some key concepts.",

Get a CD paying 5% that matures in a year.\n\nNow if you don't mind the risk of loosing a significant amount potentially investing in a somewhat diversified stock selection over that time you can do that.\n\nTaking out company risk in an index like you mentioned will help but you still run market risk and you can loose a significant amount if the market pulls back.",

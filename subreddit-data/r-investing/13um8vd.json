I am sure having success in this is based on years of experience and special skills.  The trick is probably knowing who your buyers might be and having access to them.",

It will cost you probably about $10 per year per domain name.\n\nAnd if you want to invest in websites then you likely want at least having a website with decent authority so you can provide backlinks to websites you have bought. Or know how to make them perform better in some other ways.",

If you parked a local domain similar to my business name, arbitrage can take it away from you (very simplified). \n\nI only bought a specific set of domains once, part of deterrence tactics, but on a regular day I'd just opt for a different domain. I don't see parking as a good investment. Only one of bought domains was parked and I've been monitoring it for close to a decade prior to purchase. That guy made some money off of it, if he owned it only for a decade, and was willing to reduce price significantly when approached which makes me think he wanted to get rid of it.",

Question is, I don\u2019t have much savings, should I divide that 100k and build a portfolio + cash ( in savings) or immediately turn around and flip the 100k and buy 100k worth of VOO shares. \n\nYour thoughts please! \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "If I were you, the first step I'd take is to put some into an HYSA for an \"emergency fund\" to cover 3-6 months of living expenses (and hopefully never have to touch it).\nDo you have any high interest debt (credit card debt, student loans, etc)? I'd pay off all of that next, because there's slim chance VOO (or any index) would be able to beat the interest rate on credit card debt, and student loans interest might be sort of close to an expected return. \n\nWhatever is left over, you can decide to either DCA(dollar cost average) that money in VOO, or just put it all in at once. That really just depends on your risk tolerance. Typically, \"time in the market\" beats \"timing the market\", but if you believe there's an impending recession, you're better off DCAing that money",

                    "comment": "(Edited/elaborated upon after further thought):  \n\n\nPaying off all higher-interest debt is an obvious first step.  But given that he can always cash out stock investments, I don't personally think it makes sense at his age (if a single person) to have significant cash sitting in an account that at best will marginally outperform inflation, and will likely actually lose value.  \n\n\nIt also would appear to more sense to first eliminate any high-interest debts, and then reduce his taxes as much as possible with retirement contributions, vs. first funding a savings account.  Given that the saved interest and taxes will quickly help fund any such savings account, and the odds of an immediate emergency are fairly low.  With retirement funds always available for an emergency if truly necessary.  \n\nA better approach to me would be to:\n\n1. First Pay off high-interest debt.  (He can always use those credit cards to live on if an emergency hits, with no net cost to him vs. saving money in cash and leaving the debts unpaid.  He should actually come out ahead for having at least temporarily avoided that interest.)\n2. Max out 401K/T-IRA contributions if he's in the 20%+ brackets.  The associated tax breaks will help fund him through any emergencies.  He can leave the money in cash if he's worried about a market downturn during an emergency.  If he becomes unemployed long enough that he needs to access those funds, his income (and income tax rate) will likely be lower that year, enough to offset any 10% early-withdrawal penalty.\n3. Once those steps are done, put 2-3 months worth of expenses in a HYSA. (Note that he may be eligible for unemployment compensation also.)\n4. Once that is done, max out (as much as possible) Series I I-Bonds purchases.  (These will generally outperform a HYSA, have their rate recalculated every 6 months to exceed inflation, and are even more secure.)\n5. As each $1K worth of I-Bonds becomes eligible for withdrawal, shift that much cash into further I-Bonds purchases.  Build up to 6 months worth of living expenses in accessible I-Bonds\n6. This will ultimately leave you with a nice, fat, secure emergency fund that won't be losing value due to inflation.",

If a big recession hits and you lose your income stream, any \"emergency funds\" you have saved in the markets could ALSO be down a sizeable amount. It would really hurt to be pulling out assets out at their all time lows just to survive. \n\nHaving your cash in a HYSA isn't so that it's easy to retrieve, it's to hedge against risk and market fluctuations.",

AI has shifted the way everyone's thinking and I'm finding myself having to pivot toward some new skills, plus mass layoffs have flooded the market with lots of candidates... but I'm not stressed about it one bit because I built a solid emergency fund. \n\nI kept 6 months worth in a HYSA (~4.x%) and put another two months in treasury bills when they were at 9% and 6%. 3 months later and I'm still sitting on around 4.5 months of savings because I also reduced my expenses as soon as I lost my income, and if by some crazy misfortune I don't find a job by then I can withdraw the T-bills.\n\nAnd the funny thing is I've made more in interest than I would have if all of that was in VOO - plus I don't have to worry about delayed withdrawals or reporting taxes. \n\nThe simple fact is that investing and saving are two completely different things. You can use the market for short term savings if you're savvy, but that's not what the market is designed for and it's a terrible strategy for most people.",

The way I did it was $1k per month, ending up with $4k total. That way they're like a rolling emergency fund. At the same time I built up $6k as an emergency fund in a SoFi account which fluctuates but it's been bouncing between 4.3% and 3%. $1000 a month would be too low for most people but for me that's 5 or 6 months of everything covered because my wife and me both pull in decent salaries and I live a really frugal lifestyle.\n\nI could cash out the T-bills right now but with those rates I got them at there's no rush. I'll eventually lose some interest on them when I do cash out but it's still better than a HYSA (for now at least). I plan on shifting that to my Roth, but if rates stay semi-high I'll just wait until the next deadline.",

I just don't personally think it makes sense, at his age, with no apparent dependents, to be first tying up that much of his money in relatively low-yield savings.  Instead of first paying off high-interest debt (which could be costing him over 20% a year on the debt), and maxing out retirement contributions (which would be savings him thousands in taxes).  \n\nMaybe a month or two in emergency cash savings to start.  But he could leave that amount in cash in his retirement accounts, obtain the associated tax breaks, and simply pay the 10% penalty if he needed to access it.  (If he's unemployed during an emergency, the tax break he received could potentially cover both the penalty and his likely-lower income tax in the withdrawal year .  Even if he has to take a loss selling off some stock during a downturn, the overall risk is probably worth it compared to the opportunity costs of not being otherwise invested.\n\nEven if you hit a major recession, and lose your job, you will usually receive unemployment compensation, and probably find something within a couple months to cover basic expenses.\n\nAnd as noted above, he could still do the HYSA temporarily after paying off his debts and maximizing his tax breaks, eventually shifting the emergency fund to accessible I-Bonds that will outperform most HYSA's, and be even more secure.  \n\nThis would all appear to make more sense than simply first putting a large amount of cash in a savings account where the value will likely erode due to inflation.  The odds of an emergency happening within the next 6 months are relatively low, the 10% penalty for withdrawing from a retirement fund early is not that high, and the benefit of paying off high-interest debt first is guaranteed, even if you later have to borrow on those cards/sources again.    \n\n\nI like Dave Ramsey, but his advice is largely for people who can't think too much for themselves, and need things made simple.",

Best to pay that off first.  This will also leave you more money to put into savings/retirement contributions.  \n\nIf you're left without a job for an extended period, your income that year will likely be lower than it was the year you maxed out your 401K/T-IRA contributions, realizing significant tax breaks and extra money as a result.  That means that the difference in tax rate may well wipe out (or exceed) the (relatively modest) 10% penalty you'll see when withdrawing cash early from the retirement fund.\n\nThe issue, of course, is not whether to save for emergencies.  It's how to save.  If you're concerned about market dips -- which is a valid concern -- you can leave 3-6 months worth of cash in your retirement funds, until you have acquired a similar amount in accessible I-Bonds, which will pay better than an HYSA, and be more secure.  \n\nAnd paying off high-interest debt first and foremost is a no-brainer to me in terms of being able to weather a potential financial storm.  Worst case scenario, you borrow on those cards or HELOC (etc.) again when you have to, having first realized the temporary gains of having them temporarily paid off. .

During the pandemic in the U.S., you could withdraw funds from a T-IRA or 401K without penalty.  At the start of 2016, the Dow was around 16K.At the start of 2019, the Dow was around 23K.  By March 13 2020, 2 weeks into the pandemic, the Down had dropped back to that level.  (And then, very briefly, moved lower, though still above the 2016 level.)By April 2020, the Dow was back up to 24K, and continued moving up for the rest of the Pandemic.  The Dow is now around 34K.\n3. If the typical worker had put 6 months expenses into a cash savings account in early 2019 or most earlier periods, instead of  Dow index fund, they would've missed out on significant market gains that could've helped carry them through the pandemic more effectively.  And they may not have even needed to cash out any of those index funds if they had employment compensation (which was extended during the pandemic), and lived frugally while unemployed.\n4. Few workers over the past 14 years would've benefited from leaving 6 months expenses in cash vs. investing that money in the market and withdrawing it if/when needed.  Most would've lost earnings as a result, even if they were fired during that period.  Because the market has generally moved steadily upward or plateaued over that period, with only brief significant dips.  Like most of the past 70+ years.  (And nobody really needs to cash in very much in any given month to cover basic expenses.)\n5. If you're concerned about temporary market downturns, you can leave 3-6 months worth of retirement contributions in cash in those accounts, instead of investing it.  You'll still get thousands in up-front tax breaks, and because your income will likely be lower in the \"emergency\" year you withdraw it, they will likely outweigh the modest 10% withdrawal penalty.  \n6. I was able to live on nothing but unemployment compensation for over 6 months when I was downsized.  Didn't have to sell any stock.\n7. History would therefore indicate that for most single guys, leaving 3-6 months in cash for emergency funding, vs using retirement accounts as emergency funding, is overly risk-averse and counterproductive.  Similar to buying gold as hedge, or leaving money under your mattress.\n8. If you have dependents, it may make sense to be overly cautious, in order to protect them from the stress of marked lifestyle changes and theoretical (though unlikely) major crises worse than Covid.  If you don't, it probably doesn't.  At worst, you might take a 20%-30% hit on your overall investment withdrawals.  (Even during the GFC, the market only dropped about 40% from earlier peaks, and that deep trough was fairly brief.)  But you probably won't, and you'll probably end up with more emergency reserves as a result.\n9. Most people don't have to pay off medical bills for elderly patients.  If you do, like other dependents, you can/should factor this into your planning.  But you would probably have had more money to help your parents f you had put your emergency fund money into your retirement accounts in the years before Covid.  You would've realized an up-front tax break, which would likely have exceeded any early-withdrawal penalty, and you would've paid a lower income tax rate on that withdrawal due to your lower income that year.  You could've left all or part of it in cash if you were concerned about market fluctuations, or was buying at a peak.  \n10. In other words, your strategy really only makes sense if you have dependents, or are unwilling to think much, or incapable of doing so.  And even then, not so much.  \n11. I hope this helps.

Anticipating that the government will bail you out in an emergency situation (remove withdrawal penalties) is playing a *very* dangerous game, but I think you may be viewing it from the lens of your #5. If for some reason unemployment payments aren\u2019t an available option to you or, more likely, you run into an unforeseen *emergency* expense which ends up dragging you below the amount you\u2019ve carefully allocated from your income, then you may end up paying penalties etc. It\u2019s not risk averse when you consider the statistics and average cost of aggregate jumps in livelihood cost. I would probably say though that 6 months of living expenses is overkill. 2-3 should be a very reasonable amount, and quite frankly, if 2-3 months of living expenses breaks the bank on a retirement account\u2019s progression, that says more about the living expenses than the doctrine itself.\n\nAlso, you honestly would\u2019ve gained the moral high ground in my eyes against this guy if you didn\u2019t include #1.

He lost the moral high ground when he insulted me the first time.   \n\n\nBeyond that, I appreciate the support.    \n\n\nAs far as #2 goes -- yeah, there's no guarantee the government will waive the withdrawal penalty.  But that penalty is only 10%   Not a ton.    \n\n\nWhen you factor in standard/average market growth over a few years, it would appear to make sense to roll the dice, as your growth will likely exceed that penalty.   \n\n\nThe bigger concern, of course, is an outright market downturn, which could well exceed 10% (or 20%).  If someone wants to play it safe, they could simply leave 3-6 months expense worth of their Retirement account contributions in cash, until they've created a 3-6 month emergency fund through accessible I-Bonds.  That way, they still get the benefit of the up-front 401K/IRA tax break, and even if have to withdraw it early (which they likely won't), that tax break will probably largely or completely cover the withdrawal penalty, especially since their income should be lower that year.",

And there will usually be some kind of work available to help pay bills, even if it's not in his field.  \n\nMy problem with a 6-month savings fund is first, that's a ton of money that's not really gaining anything for a long period of time.  Secondly, having that much money in savings may demotivate the person who was just fired from getting another job quickly.  (Getting fired can be demoralizing generally.)  Third, it will also enable him to not do whatever work would otherwise be necessary to tide him over until he does find a job in his field.  \n\nIn other words, too much of a cushion can be counterproductive in such cases.  Whereas money invested in the market will still be available on an emergency basis, even if he has to take a loss on it (which won't always be the case, especially if he bought the stock awhile ago.)  The reluctance to avoid a loss will simply motivate the person to find work more quickly, even if it's something temporary outside his field.  \n\nI'd therefore say that a generous cash emergency fund makes sense if you have a family depending on you.  But a leaner one probably makes just as much sense, if not more, if you're just one guy supporting himself.  A HELOC during times of low rates would also probably be adequate.  \n\n(I got fired 27 years ago from a job and lived on nothing but unemployment compensation for over 6 months.  Even that was enough of a cushion to de-motivate me.  I know other people who did the same.)",

I'm glad you knew a few people who worked, presumably part-time, during the pandemic despite receiving aid.  But you can't get unemployment compensation while working full-time.  And by 2021, employers were begging for workers, and yet many remained on the sidelines.  Because they were being paid to stay home.  Something the administration counted on, as they expressly stated they wanted to improve worker salary leverage.  Your bias is showing if you don't understand all this. \n3. Huh?

That makes no sense, especially since those cards can usually borrowed on again if an emergency arises.    \n\n\nIt also doesn't make much sense to set aside that much cash before maxing out retirement contributions and associated deductions.   Those deductions put extra cash in your hand that can be used for further savings.  If you're worried about a market downturn, that money can be left in cash in your retirement account.  The withdrawal penalty is only 10%, which will likely be outweighed by the tax break and the lower tax rate in the emergency year.    \n\n\nAfter debts are paid off, and retirement accounts are fully funded, it would make sense to create a separate emergency fund outside the retirement accounts.  (So that R.A. money could be invested and grow tax free.)  But that should only be done temporarily in cash, with I-Bonds being purchased to create a longer-term emergency fund once they are accessible.",

We know that Roth is really only better if you expect to earn more in retirement than at the time of contribution. \n\nI guess you're saying that a younger worker still in the 12% tax bracket is figuring he may eventually sock enough away that he'll be withdrawing enough in retirement to put him in a higher tax bracket then.  I guess this is theoretically possible, but most Americans are unlikely to be withdrawing more than $20K a year from retirement accounts to supplement social security in retirement, meaning they'll probably remain in a low tax-bracket in retirement.  (The median 401K balance maxes out at $55K, at age 60.  That will give the typical worker only a few grand extra a year in retirement over 20 years.  Even if he has a comparable amount in IRA's, that will still only mean under $10k a year extra over 20 years.)  \n\nNote also that not all people have access to a 401K or any employer-sponsored plan.  And that the truly \\*optimal\\* tax bracket is presumably zero.  And that without a 401K, contributing to a T-IRA is one of the things that will make a full IRA contribution ($6.5K) feasible for younger workers, because it lowers the amount the IRS takes from their income each year, and leaves more money available for contributions. \n\n(I can understand the concern about higher future tax rates.  But that again is mainly a concern for people who expect to have very high annual withdrawals from their IRA's/401K's.  Like over $40K yearly.   The typical retirement investor is unlikely to see much hassle in this area.)",

(Clearly, if you get 401K employer-matching to any extent, you should first contribute to your 401K, at least up to that extent.)  This guy is apparently selling a company, so he's not a traditional employee, and may not have a 401K set up for himself.  \n2. A large majority of Americans (over two-thirds) earn under $73K.\n3. MAGI subtracts 401K contributions.  Current 401K contribution limits for most workers is $22.5K, and $30K for those over 50.    This means that if someone making $95.5K (or a 50+ yr-old worker making $102K) maxes out their 401K contributions, they will still be able to deduct any T-IRA contribution.  80% of U.S. workers would fall under those income limits.\n4. If this guy is smart, he'll have the money paid to him over the course of a couple years, to reduce the tax consequences.  \n5. Anyone with over $45K of taxable income will have a 22% marginal tax rate.  That represents a significant up-front tax break.  If you have over $11K in taxable income, you'll still see a 12% up-front tax break.  And given that most Americans will earn less in retirement than they do while working, the up-front tax break for either group will likely be more beneficial than tax-free retirement withdrawals.\n6. Contributing to a T-IRA will only \"inhibit\" (i.e., complicate, but not prevent) backdoor Roth conversions if you make non-deductible contributions to a T-IRA.  Clearly, you should never make a non-deductible contribution to a T-IRA as long as a Roth IRA contribution is permissible.  (Because the Roth will then clearly provide greater benefit by providing untaxed retirement income.)  But nobody is saying you should.\n\nIt would therefore appear that contributing to Roth IRA's over T-IRA's only makes sense in the relatively rare situation where you A) have an employer-sponsored retirement plan, and B) your income is unusually high, such that T-IRA contributions are non-deductible.  Or where you expect to be in the relatively unusual situation where your taxable income in retirement will be higher than while you're working.  Correct?",

Otherwise, it's a coin toss IMO.\n\nThe three funds you mentioned are all ETFs btw. VTI mutual fund equivalent is VTSAX, VXUS is VFWAX, VOO is VFIAX. For the purpose of my description of the pros/cons of these funds, the ETFs vs Mutual Funds are interchangeable.\n\nVOO vs VTI/VXUS is very clear cut however. VOO is the s&amp;p 500, which is the 500 biggest US companies. However there are thousands of US companies which are not included. VTI is the total is stock market, which includes the thousands of companies within it weighted by market cap. IMO, you want VTI over VOO because it captures all the small/mid gap movement that VOO does not.\n\nVXUS is all non-US stocks weighted by market cap. International exposure is a huge debate in the boglehead world. On the one hand, US has outperformed ex-US in recent decades. On the other hand, that is not always the case, and there are a bunch of major companies like Samsung that you are not exposed to by just US exposure. IMO the US economy seems poised to outperform the rest of the world again in the near future, but that may also be priced in already to the market which would make ex-US stocks have more room to move up than US stocks do.\n\nThat's a long-winded way of saying there are endless arguments pro and against international exposure. I personally have my stock portfolio split 80/20 US vs ex-US. I know I'm overweight US, it's my own bias.\n\nBtw, if you don't care about any of this and want \"perfect\" diversification, you can just buy the global market (ETF is VT, mutual fund is VTWAX).",

That said, ETFs, but for reasons that are usually insignificant. \n\n* In theory, ETFs can have fewer taxable events than mutual funds.  In a retirement account, this matters not at all, but in a brokerage, you'd prefer fewer taxable events.\n\n* Mutual funds have a 1 day wait for sales and ETFs don't.  Likely that this also matters not at all to  you.\n\nOne reason to use mutual funds would be if your brokerage does not allow fractional ETF shares from dividend reinvestment or something like that.  But I think most brokerages do this now, so not a huge worry.\n\nVTI contains most US stocks, market cap weighted.  That means about 3/4 of their basket is VOO, with the other 1/4 being mostly large companies outside the S&amp;P, and some small amount in small companies.  So you're already getting tons of exposure to VOO just by owning VTI -- it's just slightly more diversified.  And full disclosure, I pulled 3/4 out of my butt -- I've seen numbers from 70% to over 80% VOO.  And if you look at VTI returns vs VOO returns, they move nearly in perfect lockstep... coefficient of correlation generally 0.99.",

About 80% of it is SP500 but it has a little extra zest (small and mid caps). \n\nThe other funds to look at are SPY, which is a go to for an SP500 fund.

You can't go wrong with VOO, at least not more wrong than the high-cap market as a whole, but better performance requires more research.",

I recently got a little over 100k in equities from an inheritance I had been waiting to receive, and aside from paying off 100% of debt (CC + car loan), I immediately put about 10k away in a MMF as my emergency fund, currently earning a 7 day average yield of 4.74%.\n\nI would also (like I did) take $6,500 of it and put it into a Roth IRA (if you don't have one already, set one up!) That's the max contribution you can make per year. Invest into low cost index funds (I like a large (S&amp;P 500), mid, and small cap fund, plus about 10% in an International index fund to cover the whole market.)  The account must be open a minimum of 5 years + you must be 59.5 before you can withdraw gains without a penalty, but any gains come out tax free in retirement. It's one of the most powerful retirement accounts you can have, which is why they have a limit on contributions.\n\nIf you want to continue investing, you could take some and put it into a taxable brokerage account - maybe buy into [NOBL](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/strategic/nobl), an ETF (exchange-traded fund) that holds about 70 of the most consistently paying dividend stocks, known as Dividend Aristocrats (paying an increasing dividend every year for 25+ years), or Dividend Kings (50+ years).\n\nDefinitely do DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) - put in a set amount per week or month; don't dump it in all at once. That tends to give you a better average price over the long term.",

You can also convert your T-IRA's to Roth IRA's.    (Backdoor conversion.)   In years of unusually low income -- like if you semi-retire early -- you can withdraw money contributed to a T-IRA and put it in a Roth IRA, without penalty.  You'll pay standard income tax on the withdrawal, but if you're not earning as much money that year,  the top marginal tax rate should be pretty low, lower than it is today.  The money deposited into the Roth can then be withdrawn 5 years later tax-free, along with any associated growth.  That's my understanding anyway.",

(And so they don't get too bored in retirement either, as they can keep working part-time into their 70's.)

I would not leave much money sitting around in cash due to current high inflation.  \n\n\nMake sure you fully fund any 40K and Traditional IRA options you have this year, especially since you will be in a high tax bracket this year.  That will reduce the amount Uncle Sam takes, and your money invested in those accounts will grow tax-free.  If you do not already have a traditional IRA, open one up.  You can do this yourself through ETrade or many other brokerage accounts for no fee.  Plan to use most of the remainder to fully fund those retirement accounts in future years, since you apparently haven't been able to before.   \n\n\nIf you are/were self-employed running this company, and were the only employee, you may be able to open up a Solo 401K, and contribute far more than you could to a standard 401K or IRA.  And thereby shelter far more of that $100K form taxes, thereby saving you a ton of money. \n\nIf you do not yet own your own home, that is otherwise the most important investment you can make.  Creates long-term forced savings into a generally appreciating asset, and will eventually save you greatly in rent.)  But might want to wait for the housing market to cool down.

My approach is to focus on Index Funds and ETF's, but to have at least a couple types of each for maximum diversification.    \n\n\nI can understand the general preference for 100% S&amp;P Funds, but to me, it's a little more fun to have maybe half your portfolio in extremely broad-based, diversified funds like VOO, another 20%-25% in other index funds like QQQ and the Dow (like somewhat stronger performance over time), 15%-25% in Industry Sector ETFs (especially more nascent industries like Cannabis, Green Energy, Battery, Electric Car, etc. that will likely take off in 10-20 years), and then 5%-10% in individual companies I know, use and like, like Amazon.    \n\n\n(I shop frequently through Amazon, use Amazon Prime, and I don't see them being dethroned at an online retailer giant anytime soon.  They also do other things that make them a solid company.  I bought a single share for about $1K a few years ago, and it's doubled since then.  \n\n\nIn terms of nascent industries, it doesn't seem that hard to see that certain industries, like Cannabis and Green Energy, will do very well in the future as government inevitably changes policy.  (By legalizing cannabis federally, and eventually taxing carbon.)   The main problem is determining which individual companies will succeed./fail  But if you buy an industry-wide ETF, you're betting on the entire industry, and will likely do well.)",

(This, of course, is why 401K's and IRA's, especially T-IRAs, are so desirable.)\n\nTo begin with, if you are self-employed, and don't yet have a 401K, you may be able to create a Solo 401K, and fully shelter over $60K of that money from taxation.  If you own your own business, and already have a 401K program in place, you should be able to shelter a similar amount making contributions as both Employer and Employee.  \n\nIn that vein, it would also make sense to structure the sale such that you get the $100K+ over two or even three years.  Part of the money could be placed in escrow or a trust account somewhere, and doled out to you in the first month of the next year or two.\n\nThe reason for this is to keep that money from being taxed excessively if it ends up pushing you into a higher tax bracket.\n\n(The cleanest example would be if that's the only income you'd be seeing over the next couple years.  In that case, if you were paid the $100K all in one year, you'd normally pay over $14K in taxes, and keep less than $86K.  However, if you split it up into two years, you'd only pay $4200 on it each year, or $8400 in total, and keep $91.6K.  That's about $6K extra you could keep in your pocket, and put toward retirement.)\n\nRemember, money invested is always somewhat of a gamble.  Money saved through tax deductions/avoidance is always a sure thing.",

    "postText": "Ok, so years ago I knew a wealthy individual who retired at 40 with a 2Million dollar house, and 2 kids in private school and one in college, so not insanely  wealthy but rock solid wealthy.  I asked him how he got there. He said, \"Well, mostly I did a lot with life insurance that always preformed well for me\"\n\nNow I know he didn't earn his money through selling life insurance, and I know he had a high paying job in his 30's. \n\nI am curious  to see what you guys in  r/investing  think about this statement, and I'm  wondering  if anyone  has an idea of what exactly  he did. \n\nPlease keep in mind, I know he could have been lying, but this man had no reason  to lie to me, and he  was very very helpful  to me in other ways all the time. I moved away and sadly didn't keep in touch with him, but I am sure if I had he would have been happy to share the secrets of his success.  As it was I was his son's coach, and I didnt feel comfortable trying to get the details of his strategy at the time.",

            "comment": "Whole life applies to a very niche group of individuals. For most people, it doesn\u2019t make sense and is an outright bad deal. Very wealthy people benefit from whole life because it offers an additional means of investing money tax free. If you make a lot of money, you won\u2019t qualify for an IRA so a whole life policy allows you to invest tax-advantaged through the cash value component. These policies charge a lot, but an ultra high net worth individual would probably lose more to taxes on the alternative ways to invest so it makes sense for them. The death benefit is also used as a generational wealth transfer tool that bypasses probate and estate taxes, which can really bog down a wealthy persons assets after they die. For most normal earners, we can max out our 401ks and Roth IRAs to pad our retirements, we don\u2019t need complex and pricy vehicles like whole life to get ahead. We also probably won\u2019t die with enough assets that we\u2019d have to pay estate taxes, because the exemption is up to a couple million.",

While a Roth IRA has a strict income limit and those with earnings above it cannot contribute at all. \n\nBut no such rule applies to a traditional IRA -- nor do other types of IRAs, such as SEP-IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs, which are commonly used by self-employed people and small business owners. You can contribute to a SIMPLE or SEP-IRA no matter how high your income is, provided you meet the eligibility requirements for these account types.",

This could very well be the \"life insurance investment\" he its talking about.\n\nViaticals are purchasing *someone else's* active life insurance policy for a severely reduced value.  You give them the small cash up front.  When they die, you get the whole policy payout. \n\nWhy would this be profitable?  Because you are buying policies of people that are terminally ill.  So a person could have a 2 million dollar policy on themselves, find out they have 6 months to live.  An investor might buy that policy for $500k, giving that cash to the terminally ill person so they can spend it now, and a few months the investor gets $2 million payout so a $1.5 million profit for 6 months or less.\n\nMy understanding is that law has changed since then, but OP's friend may have made huge money prior to those legal changes.",

Overfunding a whole life plan can be a good strategy, but only if certain conditions are met. Otherwise it could be a costly mistake. A financial advisor or life insurance agent is not typically qualified/allowed to give tax advice and of course they have a vested interest in selling you a policy. Once a cpa green lights this strategy, then an agent can find one for you if you want. For a general rule though, this kind of plan is usually only looked at after all other retirement saving vehicles have been maxed out. Good luck, and don\u2019t be swayed by a sales pitch!",

Moreover when I do access it I pay ordinary income on all gains.  Any money that comes out is LIFO so if I'm paying maximum taxes.  And if I try and borrow against it that's a taxable distribution.  \n\nNo with whole life I'm getting the same general fund (Athene itself doesn't sell whole life but plenty of annuity providers do).  I do have higher fees though admittedly part of that is getting life insurance which gives my return an extra kick when I die.  It is 100% liquid with no surrender charges, though a somewhat higher front load, so we'll call that a wash.     If I want to remove money it comes out FIFO so it is tax free.  More importantly I can access the interest tax free through policy loans (either direct or indirect recognition won't matter).  When the money goes back in after I repay the loan, no load which is different than when I 1035 that Athene annuity over and surrender charges start all over. \n\nNot seeing how that's not worse.  Trust me I wish it weren't.  MYGAs are way way simpler.  It would be terrific if you could access them the same way.  But the LIFO vs. FIFO and loans count as distributions make them worse products for most uses.",

This works because of cash value, which accrues based on the amount of coverage and the amount you\u2019re paying for it. People will pay 5 or 6 figures a month into a whole life policy and let it accrue cash value, they will then use that cash value to buy even more, which will build up the cash value faster so on and so fourth. \n\nHowever, as a life insurance product it\u2019s wonderful. The premiums are level so they never increase like term life policies do. A lot of people advocate for term life due to it being cheaper, but over time term life will increase in premium and will eventually expire or become too expensive to renew. Whole life is a great way to guarantee your family money and build a larger estate",

            "comment": "First off I haven't read the comments yet but I suspect you are going to get a stream of negative information.  In general the stock crowd doesn't understand insurance products well.  They settle for \"avoid them\" rather than providing good quality education on how best to utilize them and how to construct a policy properly.  \n\nWhat the person probably meant was that they constructed a high early (or say 5-8 year) cash value life insurance policy and used this policy to finance investments.  That's a reasonable strategy that makes more sense as you get wealthier.  A well constructed whole life insurance is a worse tax option than 401k, IRA, Roth... so if you have room in those options they should be preferable.  \n\nStock funds are usually fairly tax efficient.  Insurance companies can boost the tax efficiency, but the insurance drag and higher expenses  on insurance can be often overwhelm the advantages of stocks.  However, there are lots of ways to get the both best worlds (for example being 60%: 150% stocks, -50% cash in your brokerage account; and 40% tax deferred fixed income via. whole life) to more than compensate for the costs via. tax advantages. \n\nHowever, and this is key, you must construct the policy reasonable well.  Your typical insurance agent doesn't understand whole life nor IUL well (and they aren't even licensed to sell VUL).  Insurance companies compound this problem with poor training and creating financial incentives to sell poorly constructed policies.  In this environment you as a consumer are going to need to learn how to construct a policy properly. An agent will happily give you a policy with too high a MEC limit (more insurance drag), to short or too long a pay scheme... And when you get to UL they will happily sell you a policy designed to blow up in a tax holocaust and/or have the insurance bankrupt the policy in your 70s.  There are far less good sources of information in insurance than there are in stocks since it is still mostly always sold as a loaded commissioned product.   You are going to need to work with an agent who is doing a volume business in large dollar well constructed policies rather than selling high commission poorly constructed policies.  And then insurance companies are annoying since at the end of the day to get the tax advantages you do need to be buying (and in the beginning quite a lot) of their internal one year term life insurance. \n\nI'm thinking of doing a series of posts on how and why to construct tax advantaged bonds via. insurance.  I'd point you to my series once I write it but for now: https://www.youtube.com/@IBCGlobalInc is a terrific place to get a good initial education on policy design (note they specialize in only whole life from Guardian and Mass Mutuel, you do want to watch other people's content before buying).  You will need to understand their approach and then branch out from there.",

You are either very young, or this sounds like the agent is doing a good job trying to create early cash value.  There are other factors but so far it sounds like he was trying to help you not hurt you.  If it had been closer to 10::1 then I suspect the policy would have been crap.",

Which means he's placing the opposite bet. (oversimplifying)  In permanent life you make steady product payments and the insurance company pays out a large chunk of money when you die.  In an annuity you pay in a large of money and the insurance company pays out steadily until you die.",

This was my reaction when I replied to a a post about a biotech company which was looking to invest in blockchain and changed their name to ' xxxx blockchain something' (I forget I'll look it up). I said the whole world has gone mad and got down voted for it but it's true. The money grab has moved past the internal ecosystem of blockchain and is bleeding into other domains. This rings similar to the Dotcom bubble where companies would put .com at the end of their names and IPO for a gabillion dollars. Blockchain is useful but it's a nascent technology that can't be applied to everything. I made a bit of money on it but I sold up recently after seeing shit like this. Might jump back in after it's stops getting coverage in the news, my Facebook feed isn't over run with people telling me how revolutionary it is, and after companies which have no reason to be involved in blockchain stop getting involved.\n\nEdit: Other company name was 'Riot Blockchain inc.' after doing more reading it turns out the company wasn't doing so well and has actually switched to a blockchain company. This isn't as bizarre as claiming you still focus on the same unrelated niche (being spr chips) but looks like a cash grab. https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=riot+blockchain+bioptx+name.change&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;dcr=0&amp;ei=J_87WsX6GIqM8gXjs5TACg",

Maybe if WoW gold was an industry standard that many MMOs used as currency, and there was a fixed number printed, and no single company had veto power over it's use, it'd be similar. \n\nBlockchains are different than normal data structures because they are public by nature. Eventually, network effects will choose a few blcokchains to become the industry standard, main stream implementations. They can't work like normal databases, where each company can run their own private ones in secret. The public chains that win out will be considered a major piece of internet infrastructure.  Assuming they still have a limited supply of coins, the people holding those coins will be holding a valuable \"share\" of the infrastructure",

If Microsoft, or Apple, or AmEx, or Visa, or JPM, or Amazon, or someone at least tangentially involved in Fintech was doing this, at least that's a reasonable argument. \n\nI reiterate: what experience does LTEA have in blockchain that will allow it to compete with all the other blockchain companies? Do they have more experience in blockchain than in making fidget spinners? Do they have more experience than in making calendar bindings? \n\nNote: I'm not even arguing that blockchain mania is retarded (but it is). I'm simply saying that these new players are literal bubble-mania frauds, and the fact that people can't see that is frankly hilarious.",

They probably have a higher budget than any of these companies and actually have experience operating a legal business. \n\nThere is no reason they couldn't succeed in the field if they hired and funded the right people. Its kinda social network meets boiler room-ish I imagine. \n\nBut I suppose part of the appeal to an investor is the supposed promise of short term gainz from massively increased liquidity in this new business and a dramatic increase in the company's product's profit margin compared to the expenses involved in making and distributing a beverage. \n\nFor all we know they could be run by people who actually do have experience in the field. \n\nBut... I'm researching as I type this...\n\nThey've only been around since 2011 and became publicly listed in July 2016. \n\nAlso don't get too excited because this massive surge only served to bring them back up to the original IPO price. So they have been severely underperfoming a bullish market and lost more than half its value in the past year and a half before today. \n\nSo this is likely a hail Mary attempt to save the company. By pivoting to something requiring less employees, less government oversight, less overhead, and an overall easier to manage product without worrying about physical distribution. \n\nThe CEO is some guy named Philip Thomas. Who graduated James Madison in 1998. He has been president or \"senior adviser\" of MVE from 2003-present. He says MVE is a \"50 year old food and beverage distribution business, involved in creating a strategic partnership with Coca-Cola, VitaminWater (which is owned by Coca-Cola -ed), and Kelloggs.\"\n\nMVE (after a lot of research) is basically just a Vending machine distributor company for the tri-state area. Magnum Vending Enterprises. It was Incorporated and filed as an LLC though the corporation is lapsed and is only active as LLC now. \n\nAnnnnnnd while he is currently CEO of Long Island Iced Tea, he is currently working at MVE as President/senior advisor, he also is currently CEO/senior advisor of Capital Link Holdings Corp. \n\nHere's where things get interesting, Capital Link Holdings Corp is said on his linkedin to be \"a nationally recognized ATM processing network he founded.\" It's says it's \"partnered with, among others, WSFS Bank, Cash Connect, RBS WorldPay, and Switch Commerce.\" Further it says Capital Link is \"involved in funding over 13,000 ATMs in all 50 states with over $8 Billion annually.\" However their address is listed as a PO Box in New York. There is also a \"Magnum Vending Corp\" under his name at the same PO Box as well. \n\nI assume Capital Link is basically just a business that puts ATMs in locations in the tri-state-area like the Vending machine business. \n\nHe also was using Magnum Vending Corp (separate from MVE) to pay himself to distribute his own Long Island Iced Tea products. \n\nI gotta say, I just spent like an hour researching this guy and it sounds like he is a smart successful serial entrepreneur who has exhibited smart decision making judging by what I see. To apply his existing distribution system he was using for Vending machines to put in ATMs as well was smart and he then seems to have figured, \"why not make money off both ends and sell my own product in my machines to jumpstart a brand\" however you're then limiting your market if you can't get it to be sold in stores. \n\nMost interesting is that again, it was at about 1/3 the price of the 1.5 year old IPO before today so were in trouble. \n\nAnd there is nothing to indicate this guy knows anything about blockchains.",

A beverage company leveraging blockchain outside bubblemania wouldn't be \"competing with all the other blockchain companies,\" they'd be doing it to compete with all the other beverage companies.\n\nSupply chain management is a textbook example of an enterprise application for the distributed ledger, and tech like hyperledger sawtooth avoids the ridiculous energy demands and other limitations of earlier blockchain implementations that focused on token economies. Comparisons to calendar bindings etc are just silly because they're not applicable to this space's problems the way a distributed ledger could be. \n\nOf course, if the company is pivoting entirely to \"let's faff around with this new blockchain stuff\" then the whole situation is pretty ridiculous - and I'm certainly not disagreeing that this is really irrational market behavior. But the idea that you need to be a fintech company to benefit from blockchain tech or that \"Blockchain\" belongs in an isolated, individual competitive space both sound pretty myopic to me. Much of this discussion is very misinformed, lots of people are equating blockchain tech to cryptocurrencies and they're really not the same thing. Blockchain as a technology enables the development of cryptocurrencies, and those currencies are driving the current bubble, but they're hardly the alpha-omega of the tech in general. ",

You are right that Berkshire Hathaway originated as a textile manufacturer, but the management team that built that textile business is not the same team that turned it into a holding company for investing in other businesses. The former was Seabury Stanton, who was a textile expert, and the latter was Warren Buffet, who is an investing expert.\n\nThat is all very different than what is going on with this tea company. The management of this company, which has some expertise in the tea business, now wants to enter a completely unrelated field. There is zero evidence this management team has any capabilities in the crypto space. It's asinine.\n",

    "postText": "Have built a well diversified portfolio with small value/large value, growth, US, ex-US dev markets and emerging markets. Plus US bonds, ex-US bonds, long treasuries and gold. Keep adding to it trying to stay the curse and yet everything is going down but the only thing that goes up is still VOO/QQQ, pulled by few tech growth gang stocks. After so much effort in defining a so damn diversified portfolio in this unstable economy it is frustrating seeing it performing again worse than SP500 in a market that is considered overvalued given the economic uncertainties.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is this another tech bubble waiting to pop and when you would expect so? Or should I just put my mind in piece that valuation will no longer matter as it did in the past?",

The portfolios that lie on the \u2018frontier\u2019 are the most efficient ones. \n\nThen by using leverage at risk free rate, you can draw a line to any point on the frontier, a \u2018capital market line\u2019\n\nIt is just assumed that the optimal portfolio is the market portfolio\n\nBut you can backtest a combination of securities and find many portfolios with a higher sharpe ratio than the market\n\nAnyway the entire volatility to measure risk and the assumptions made are silly. \n\nWhat matters for young people in reality is not volatility - they just want to find the securities that will eventually yield the highest return regardless of how it moves daily or monthly \n\nIf the market portfolio had little volatility but only goes up 8% per year, it would be less desirable than the stock that moves around a lot but averages 20% even if it had the lower sharpe ratio\n\nAlso in reality borrowing money to lever up risk is not simple. A market portfolio levered up to 20% may face a margin call in 2022 and may not even be able to lever that much\n\nThe stock only has no margin call possibility",

My over diversification is needed for personal circumstances (investing in US, retire in EU) and my question was more a provocation. Anyway my portfolio is not really that much conservative, although I have a tilt towards small and value. My point however is that now, with these giant capitalizations a few stocks can move up the entire market against any basic fundamentals which is a bit frustrating when you spend energy to build something that makes sense while others that just follow the flow get easy profits. Maybe I'll just need to zoom out and wait for things to make sense in the long run. I hope that this \"revert to the mean\" is still a principle that will keep applying in the next decades.",

I back tested my portfolio against many alternatives and it outperformed all the other alternatives including 2 and 4 fund portfolios for the past 40 years. No, it does not outperform SP500 or US-only based alternatives and that is not what I was expecting. I'm not trying to outsmart the market but just applying what I learned so far about diversification and asset correlation from people much smarter than us. Investing only in a fund that depends on 4-5 companies does not give me the peace of mind diversification I need. And for gold, I just have little and there is a place for it especially in my specific case to have some currency protection (also this back tested against other alternatives).",

Because those figures all look very, very different today.\n\nIt's not like technology was invented in the last 12 years. The Internet is at the core of civilization today, and yet the dot com bubble wasn't that long ago and it caused a 2.5yr long crash that divided the S&amp;P 500 in half.\n\nToday, portfolio allocations are heavily into stocks, yet we're about to see treasury rates hit highs that haven't been seen for decades. This is the single best known predictor of 10-year stock market returns and, if the 70-year [trend](https://i.imgur.com/l8873Xn.png) holds, we're already into negative territory now.\n\nIf I didn't know any better, and I don't, I'd say we're staring down the barrel of a pretty legendary market crash.\n\nSomeone else mentioned Pepsi. Their estimated annual growth over the next 5 years is less than 10%, yet their P/E is $38.\n\nThink about that. That means if you bought Pepsi at their current valuation, and earnings are growing at 7.8%/yr., you're not going to make your money back for almost 19 years. You'd be a complete fool to buy such a company at that price. And unlike the favorite tech tickers, PEP is not full of hype... so what do you think is priced in that we're not seeing?\n\nNow go look at these numbers for the big cap tech companies, a couple dozen of which are single-handedly carrying the S&amp;P 500 right now. They're all _way_ overvalued. Nvidia's great but they're not going to multiply their earnings by 6000% over the next decade.\n\nWhoever suggested we were in a bubble 8 years ago couldn't substantiate it with simple value investing math but you sure can today.",

Consider Apple for example trading at a PE ratio of 30. You have to go back to the 2000s to find it trading at a ratio that high (think iPod, Intel transition, and iPhone). Meanwhile where is the growth story today? Revenue and earnings have actually *declined* YoY, mainly because their existing product lines are sufficiently good that fewer users feel the need to aggressively upgrade and their market share sufficiently high that they cannot make significant gains. Mature companies should not be trading like this. I can find you consistently growing companies trading at much lower multiples.\n\nAI is obviously interesting and useful but all of these companies were already using AI. I do not understand how *generative* AI changes the picture for these companies *at all*. Most of these companies really don't seem to know either.",

You have some weird hangups that aren't driven at all by real data.\n\n&gt;SPY is not currently performing well because the real business of these 500 companies is doing great.\n\nYou have a baseless hangup on what is a \"real\" business. A real business is one that makes money and grows in capital value. You're bigoted against tech and it's costing you potential growth. Guess what, tech is the main driver of economic and social progress in this century.",

In the past few months to justify this massive gain. Did revenue increase of 200%? If the market is always right then it was right few months ago and now which is clearly a paradox. \n\nI'm not bigoted against tech since I actually work in tech and AI and I see all of this with much less fantasy.",

You think you can pick better than the entire professional market? Of course you're going to underperform, only a rare few professional investors are able to consistently outperform those indexes. Adjust your expectations, let the markets work for you, and maybe you won't be frustrating yourself over the exceedingly improbable chance of your portfolio performing better than the top companies in the US economy.\n\n&gt;Is this another tech bubble waiting to pop and when you would expect so?\n\nIf retail amateurs think it's a bubble then it's almost definitely not.

You are assuming that the valuation of SP500 is always right because the top companies are performing better than others but it is not the case. Did you forget the 30% drop of 2022? Those valuations are just based on future earning speculations, which now has been over-hyped with the promise of AI conquering the world. According to your reasoning then we should just buy 5 individual stocks and forget about the rest of the market, which is actually going down not up.\n\nJust to give you an idea. Meta was selling for 90$ just few months ago. It has tripled his value with no fundamental changes in the business plan nor in the revenues. So either the valuation was wrong three months ago or it is wrong now, which implies that evaluations do not always make sense  logically.",

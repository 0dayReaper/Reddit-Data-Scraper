    "postText": "# ALERT!\n\nI have been buying shares of Charlotte's Web from the time it was trading $12 per share. I believe, as many of you, that Charlotte's Web is being mismanaged by its current Board of Directors. The next meeting will be held on June 15th. I voted \"WITHHELD\" to reelect its current Board of Directors.\n\nAll you need to do is contact your brokerage/clearing house and get a control number. Then go to the following website and cast your \"WITHHELD\" vote. It's time to kick these board members out!\n\nProxyVote.com - Powered by Broadridge\n\n# \n\n# ",

                    "comment": "&gt;It was widely reported that within 4 weeks of the video being posted online, United Airlines' stock price fell 10%, costing stockholders about $180 million in value. [19]\n\n&gt;In fact, UAL opened at $3.31 on 6 July 2009, dipped to an intra-day low $3.07 (-7.25%) on 10 July 2009 but traded as high as $6.00 (+81.27%) four weeks later \n\n\nConclusion: Always bet against the angry lynch mob. Their emotional rage dies out within a month, the fundamentals don't.\n\nForward P/E is 8.44\n\nROE is over 25%.\n\nAverage EPS estimate of 8.2 next fiscal year, from 17 analyst reports\n\nEV to EBITDA is under 5.\n\nDebt ratios are in line with industry standards.\n\nAverage 12 month analyst target price is $83.53\n\nDisregard angry Reddit mob, acquire UAL calls.\n\nEdit: Its actually only down 1.13% now with the market about to close. If you bought it in the morning, you got a nice little profit if you sold it a few hours later.\n",

On the first (of FOUR) transfers, the bus didn't show. 15-20 of us are standing at the gate for an hour. \"Oh, that bus left 15 minutes ago.\" Really??? THE ENTIRE FUCKING STOP MISSED THE BUS?? \"Oh, you can sleep in the lobby and get on the first bus tomorrow.\" No, some of us don't have that kind of time. We are paying for a service to get from point A to point B at by a certain time. Me and another passenger (that I never met before) didn't have the luxury of waiting 16 hours for the next bus and we were going to the same town in north east PA. So, we made some phone calls and found someone to come down and pick us both up. We paid that person twice our cost of ticket, but we got to where we needed to go. Greyhound just shrugged and told me \"no refunds.\" I don't know how the rest of the people dicked there dealt with it. But, for me, I will now rent a car or pay a friend a full day's pay to come get me. I will never deal with Greyhound again.",

I'm sure he will get an astronomical offer the absolute second his lawsuit is filed. UA will try. His lawyers will advise against accepting it. \n\nThe real money in this will be become obvious when the advocacy groups get involved which is what has the potential of growing this into a class action.

It is a huge pain to a patient, who may have scheduled their appointment months in advance, to suddenly get it cancelled.

Well, they just booted the cheapest passengers while assaulting one of them.\u00a0Combine that with a history of bad experiences and I don't see how they're going to fix this one without months of damage control.\u00a0Or, at the very least, a lot of heads on pikes.\n\nMy thesis is that it's likely that this isn't another broken guitar. No, I think it's another Chipotle or Ratner. Here's why;\n\n  * **Because he's the perfect victim.**\u00a0*Elderly*\u00a0Doctor on the way to tend to his patients is assaulted by jack booted thugs. They went after the one (?) person on that plane who could elicit universal empathy and had a valid, pressing reason to keep his seat.\n\n  * **Because there's blood.**\u00a0The fact that he was harmed is immediate and visible. There aren't any follow-on reports that need to be tacked on to emphasise the seriousness of the incident. He was an elderly man who had blood dripping from his mouth.\n\n  * **Because he's a part of at least two powerful consumer groups.** Doctors (and nurses)\u00a0are a powerful lobby, who look out for their own.\u00a0And are still the most respected profession in the US and the world. Then there's the Chinese/Asian consumers angle.\n\n  * **Because the incident's imagery is almost the perfect set of triggers for mass outrage.**\u00a0The video had a giant corporation ruining the life of someone vital to American society. Check. It had a literal jack-booted thug. Check. Said thug took something from the person/violated the integrity of their personal space/freedom over a seemingly trivial issue. Triple Check. The upstanding member of society wasn't at fault. Check.\n\nI can't see United making this work without a lot of blood letting.",

It has the chance to give huge returns, at the risk of your full initial investment.\n\n[Let's use this image as a reference for the explanation. In this image, I've selected an expiration of April 13th, 2017 for UAL.](http://i.imgur.com/UcfUhoH.png)\n\nAn option contract is the \"option\" to buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of the stock at the selected strike price at the time of the expiration. The value of the option that's \"in the money\" at expiration is the amount the actual share value is above(call)/below(put) your selected strike. Because you're basically leveraging your money 100x with each contract you buy, this allows the large returns I saw for a relatively minimal investment. I basically bought 100 shares of UAL for $61, and cashed in my realized gains on those 100 shares for $245.\n\nYesterday, when the story broke, UAL was up 1% so I assumed there would be a decent drop once it got out based on how quickly the story was spreading. A very good day followed by very bad news meant an over-correction was coming.\n\nI bought a put contract with the strike price of $71 when the actual stock price was ~$71.75, which meant in order for me to make a profit and not lose my investment, the price would have to drop below $71. For each .01 below the strike price of $71, I would make a dollar on that contract at the time of sale (plus the premium from time value and implied volatility which I won't get into now). The risk with options is that the stock never goes \"in the money\", and your option expires completely worthless at it's expiration.\n\nThis morning when the market opened the stock price dropped to $68.60, so with my $71 strike price, the option at the time was worth ~$245 based on the bid at the time which was where I sold.\n\nThe explanation got a little lengthy and possibly convoluted, I'm not that great at explaining it. But if you have any other questions on specifics let me know.\n",

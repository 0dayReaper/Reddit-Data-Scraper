    "postText": "I wanted to share my experience of the 2008 bailouts because we are among friends. Right? And friends help each others, and share their experiences. Right?\n\n\nDuring the financial crisis of 2008, it became clear that the government had to step in. People were losing their jobs, stock market dropped by more than 30%, the market was going up and down by 5-10% a day (the amount my brokerage accounts would go up or down was more than what I was earning in a month at work). It was humbling.\n\n\nIt was really tough and difficult to trade. Buy on the down days? Sell on the up days? Hold it until sky clears, despite having bled a lot of money already? I was over leveraged too (through LEAP options), which was not the smartest thing to do at the time, but heh, are you going to lock the loss?\n\n\nThen came the bailout, with a lot of volatility leading to it. A lot of back and forth for days for politicians to get a chance to pass it. (They may have failed to pass the first version even, I don't remember).\n\n\nFinally, one of the branch passes it, and it's time for the other branch to pass it. \"About time, after the bailout, things are going to get better, we can save those companies, we can move ahead and blue sky is coming.\"\n\n\nI remember at the time, I was looking at the final votes, and I could not believe it. As the votes would come in, and it became clear that the bailout would pass, S&amp;P futures started to drop, like a stone. WTF!!! Help is coming, everything will get better, why is it dropping?\n\n\nWell, the reason is simple, by signing the bailout, politicians agreed that we were in a shitty situation, companies needed to be saved, and the lousy bailout was getting signed, and there was no more good news down the line for a while. We shot our ammos, and now let's pray. So it became sell the news.\n\n\nAs the market continued dropping days after days, and I was going to be wiped out, I had to sell to not be over leveraged anymore. I had to take a 6 figures loss. And I am fortunate that I sold, because the market continued to significantly tank for almost 6 more months to level I did not think we would reach. After selling, I was not taking as much risk anymore, I got burned hard.\n\n\nAfter we reached the bottom, I switched my positions to risky assets, and I was able to make up some of the losses. But that was a great learning experience, and I figured that I preferred to learn that lesson at the time, when my accounts were not too big than later. Recovering from a 6 figures loss is doable, but more than that, and it is a decade or more of setback.\n\n\nWell, I can say that almost 12 years later (fuck, already!), the situation is very similar.\nThis time, I was ready, and maybe that will be another post to explain what I did in 2019-2020, as it can be easily applied.\n\n\nSo today:\n\n- People were losing their jobs. Check.\n\n- Stock market dropped by more than 30%. Check.\n\n- The market was going up and down by 5-10% a day. Check.\n\n- Bailout in the process, taking days to agree on. Check.\n\n\nI am not saying that the market is going to drop after the bailout is voted, but watch out for that.\nUnlike 2008, there is no blue sky coming. The bailout is only a short term fix. How long do you think $1200 per person is going to last?\n\n\nUnlike 2008, we know that the worst is ahead of us. We still don't know. In the US, the coronavirus pandemic is expected to peak in at least 2-3 weeks. But who knows?\nAs we are doubling every 2-3 days, it could mean 100 times more new cases per day. 100 times more death per day (few weeks later the infection). It's absolutely a staggering and awful number.\nHopefully, lockdown will be enforced in every state, so we can reduce this grow rate.\nHospitals are already over capacity, nobody can tell exactly how this is going to end (except that's going to be a carnage).\nEsp. as some are talking about removing the lockdown in 2 weeks!\nAnd even after the peak, it means that people are still getting sick, people are still dying, as they are hospitalized for 2-4 weeks.\nExpect at least 1-2 months of pain, even after peak.\n\n\nI understand that the market is forward looking, but there are still many opportunities for false head starts, and failed bounces from the bottom.\n\n\nFrom my experience with the 2008 bailout, nobody could really predict the bottom. Even as it was a financial crisis.\nThis time, it is not looking pretty, so please don't be like the 2008-me, don't be over-leveraged (yet), things can go either way. Politicians are very good at messing up a crisis.\n\n\nAnd most of all, be safe and healthy, stay home as much as you can. It is going to be a rough ride, and unfortunately we are only getting started.\nMy sincere thoughts for people with friends and families that are going through hardship, sickness and death.\nHang in there!\n\nEdit: Thank you for the feedback, comments and kind words. Much appreciated. Stay safe!",

I sold some on Monday once I reached 90% of the max profit.\n\nOne of the strategy I used a similar model to the SWAN ETF (I saw them during the 2009 period, they used to be a mutual fund before, now I noticed they have an ETF). If you scrub their white papers, you can figure out their strategy. It only works for brokerage account, unless you buy their ETF directly. Their method significantly underperforms during bull markets though, so I don't advise to do what they do (but buying their ETF for some % might be okay, even better than straight bonds).\n\nOtherwise, I still have bonds and cash ready to rebalance. I bought a bit during the drop, potentially too early, but you can never really time that. :)",

We recently inherited a large account and I told them to sell everything in March 1 and send us a check because we wanted to pay off our mortgage.   They told us not to worry because the account was mostly in bonds which would go up if the market continued to drop.   Not only is the account now down 10%, but, it underperformed even the most basic bond ETF or benchmark.   So they had us in really bad (junk like) bond holdings.     My fault I guess for trusting the 'experts'.",

Consider Microsoft, for example, was at $60 when Trump took office and at $145ish is now just back to where it was in November of last year before the tail end surge. So the upside is incredibly limited at this point. We'd need another 40%-50% drop for me to feel good about getting in, otherwise I think they are still way too expensive.\n\nRegarding the levered ETFs, something to consider is that they try to match the daily percentage returns of the sector or market. Down moves are harder to make up. It takes more upside to offset a similar downside. That's the biggest risk. If you're in a long 3x and the sector drops 17%, for example, you've lost half your money. To get that back the sector would have to rise 33% just for you to break even. These should be treated as short term trading strategies rather than long term investments.",

                            "comment": "when you open a margin account, the broker will usually let you leverage your account. so for example, if you put 1000 dollars, they might allow you to trade as if you had 2000 dollars.\n\nThis works great when you are making money, as you can increase your returns. For example, a 50% gain on 2000 dollars would be a 100% gain on your actual capital.\n\nThe same happens when the market goes against you. If you lose 50% of 1000, you still have 500 to continue playing. On a leveraged account, you go to 0.\n\nWith options, things get even more complicated, as you can easily over leverage without noticing, and even a small price movement against you (let's say the underlying drops 10%) can not only wipe you out, but also get you a margin call.\n\nBy playing with less capital than you have:\n\n- You sleep better at night\n- Your hands are not so shaky and you can sit tight to let positions develop\n- You won't go bankrupt\n\nSure you will see some people leverage and go to the moon, but it might not happen to you.\n\nTwo examples I have:\n\n1 - In 2008, I sold puts on FCX at 70, the stock then dropped to 35. I doubled down thinking it was  a great buying opportunity, only to watch FCX drop even further to 15 bucks. By then I got wiped out.\n\n2 - In 2020, I saw Carnival drop to 35 bucks, and jumped the gun, sold some puts at 30, thinking there was some resistance there. Stock continued to fall to 20 bucks, eventually reaching 8 bucks. At the worst point, I was down a lot on this trade, now I'm already making some $$, even with my dog entry on some options at 35. I was able to do so because I did not over leverage, and had plenty of capital to sit thru these crazy price movements and re-position.\n\nIf I wanted, I could now sell CCL for a small profit, but I'll just let it ride. It might crash again, who knows. Bottom line it doesn't matter.",

Currently I've learned from others in my life and the internet to not be stupid and read/research as much as I can before really investing. Right now I'm barely dipping my toes into just safe blue chip and normal stock buys at a low level. Sounds like in that case i'm fine in the long run. Panic selling is mainly from over leveraging it sounds.\n\nI've been reading up on options and stuff a lot recently but I know i'm only scratching the surface on truly understanding them. Probably won't even mess with them for a while until I'm really comfortable in my knowledge. As entertaining as /r/wallstreetbets is I know i'm not built for that level of stress.",

A lot of people are looking at things like every crash is generic, so stocks will act in some scripted, generic fashion.  If anyone dares say \"this time it's different\" they're likely to get mocked.   The truth is: every crash is different, because different reasons cause it, and often there are different kinds of reactions to the crash.  There's a general assumption that there will be a U or V shape recovery.  We could have a U or V shape recovery, or we could have a year of deflation followed by runaway inflation. Things might never be the same after this.  Stocks do not always go up.  Look at the Nikkei.",

Nobody has mentioned it but it\u2019s overheated in the major markets and everything is frozen for three to six months.  People tend to get 2008 wrong and think it was purely one thing.  It was never one thing. It was a collection of things that built up over time to implode everything, but the true pain comes from crashing real assets.  It is the heart of the economy and drives all aspects of consumer spending.  When it stops it crashes not just the market, but the whole economy.\n\nApril is the start of the home buying, apartment hunting, and renovation season.  It is also the time when people get out of their homes and shop retail with their newly minted refund checks.  That\u2019s gone this year.  I\u2019m in the process of moving and the market has fundamentally shifted.  I\u2019m seeing things I haven\u2019t seen in ten years.  Massive rebates, first month free, deposit waivers, TVs, 2,000 dollar gift cards for moving in type of incentives.  Dropping rent prices, disclaimers on Zillow.  That\u2019s a giant shift from the ,\u201dtake it or fuck off,\u201d attitude I\u2019ve gotten in the last five years.  \n\nSomething else I noticed and can\u2019t get out of my head is the stimulus for businesses both small and large are primarily loans.  The problem is many companies were already over leveraged to begin with.  Adding additional bridge loans will simply push many companies over the edge.  It adds underlying fixed monthly expenses that will require shorter margins or higher prices.  In competitive markets that will end several businesses on the bubble.  At the same time mortgage payments deferments only add time to the mortgage, or worse, it creates a secondary loan that adds additional monthly expenses to consumers.  \n\nOn top of that, those stimulus checks won\u2019t come for at least 3-6 weeks and no one can currently spend like they are used to. All items are coming from online purchases and many might save their money just in case a medical or financial emergency comes up.  Even after it\u2019s all done it will still take time for people to relax and start spending because there will be a lot of permanent layoffs.\n\n In my opinion this time period looks far worse than 2008.  I was expecting the market to enter a recession before the end of the year and have trouble from the over heated real estate market and the virus is pile driving the entire economy.  That\u2019s not even mentioning the oil wars.  The jobs report is coming and I have said it before, I think we will see the DOW below 16,000 before this ends and another 2 stimulus packages.",

We have a massive real estate bubble in almost all of our major metro centers, buoyed by speculation, very low interest rates, and very lenient mortgage insurance requirements.

COVID-19 will be both the accelerant and the spark.

I agree that this is not just the coronavirus causing the crash, it's been long overdue for awhile, but 2008 was a crumbling of market foundations that exposed the insolvency of so much. This is a crash due to uncertainty combined with an inevitable price correction for the market that has been propped up on stock buybacks and other unsustainable efforts.\n\nThe biggest reason I think we're in a better situation than 2008 is the means of economic recovery will be simpler. There is going to be a hit to employment, but that's not going to lead to the same mutually exclusive dynamics we had in 2008 where people no longer have a place to live and the only houses available are million dollar homes. There will be some places that end up closing, and there are going to be some lean months for many who are forced to be out of work, but the path to recovery will be much more straight forward than what needed to happen in 2008 where value needed to be completely realigned at basically a foundational level.",

The only thing I was trying to point out, which I probably didn't do very well, was that the 2008 recovery was stalled due to a significant period where the incongruities between perceived value and actual value had to be rectified. In that way, the 2008 crash was similar to the dot com crash, except it was on a much larger scale.  I don't see us needing to reconcile incongruities to nearly the same degree as a result of this situation, as it's an economic disruption more than it is a fundamental reconciliation.",

That was a response to perceived failures in the business of politics. Zero hour contracts; the gig economy. Good for some, and bad for others. Surveillance capitalism. Intensified emphasis on climate change, and habitat destruction. Social media going mainstream; for good and bad. The Panama Papers, peeling the veil on tax evasion. Edward Snowden. Massive share buybacks to artificially boost stock values. The deterioration of public health; and the rise of vegetarian and vegan lifestyle choices. Just to name a few.\n\nA lot has happened. The robustness of the global economy has come in to question, because real economy and speculation / investment have drifted so far apart, as to almost be in two different dimensions. Both of them, seemingly strong and fragile; depending which way the wind blows. \n\nMore so, recently, the real situation of public health. Notwithstanding that this is a very rare event in human history - there have never been more people with comorbidities, that only going to amplify the impact of this virus, in bringing about death. Those suffering from diabetes and obesity are some of the highest potential fatalities.

Mindblowing how dumb people are.\n\nBeing successful in finance is about understanding and mitigating your risks. Stop buying shit you don't understand. And even if you do understand it, you need to be extremely careful, especially with leverage (including options, margin accounts, and obviously 3x leveraged ETF's). Vast majority of people should avoid leverage even if they understand it due to human nature of greed to chase/over-risk.",

I was National Guard, so part time initially and working third shift retail on the civilian side. By time SHTF I was mobilized and gearing up for a deployment to Afghanistan in 2010. Everyone knows the adage, war is good for suffering economies, not to say the least about job security. By time I finished my contract and went full civilian was 2012 and I was working front end of a tattoo studio for the next five years. \n\nI'm in school now for accounting, trade options and more actively manage my long term investments. I'm on track to finish school EOY, but rn I'm really sweating how all the economic fallout is going to affect the job market mid to long term and that's not even considering the push toward digital automation in the financial space. \n\nAll that to say: if you aren't planning long term you're doing it wrong, and I'm not just talking about markets/investing. I dodged the bullet most millennials took I'm the GFC, and it feels like this time I might not be so lucky, pandemic or not. I can't stress this enough, if you're a part of younger generations do NOT blow off things you can do now to secure yourself later in life. Stay in school, no matter what level, and choose a career based not just off of emotional desire or what the job market looks like now. Always be thinking 10-20 years, if not more, into the future.\n\nTl;dr do what Boomers and Millennials didn't for the large part - take nothing for granted, do not get complacent, and always plan for the worst.",

So I am glad I saved some of it, and I learned immensely from it.\n\nI believe that the market is going up most times, and it can go down once in a while, sometimes violently. I don't like strong directional bets.\n\nSo don't sell, position your portfolio in a way that even after a 50% market drop, you don't have to sell, but actually you are ready to jump in and buy low priced if needed. It's not too hard, but FOMO makes people greedy and over committed. Everyone was laughing at Buffet when he had so much cash for the past year or two, and he said everything is expensive. Well, eventually, the wheel turns and opportunities appear, and you need to be ready to jump into the action while there is \"blood in the street\".\n\nSo right now, if your portfolio is not setup properly, it's too late. You just have to ride the wave. But next time, the market is frothy, remove the foot from the pedal, put some money on the side, and be ready.",

Also this time we have unlimited QE which is a much larger factor then simply bailing out a few key players, this is not the same. Not to say we wont have more down days but we wont see another 25% past our lows this month, Algo's have already priced the jobless claim into the market when it was speculated by many economists that it would be in the  millions which it was and Algo's have likely priced in the recovery time of china to blunt the curve as well I would assume so that when this is over which will likely be when warm weather comes and we have effectively blunted the curve then this will disappear for some time more then likely. Not to say we wont see more cases next winter but it will likely be less due to immune systems being better at fighting it from this first time.

Instead of flooding the financial market with money, the gov't should flood the healthcare system to fund and provide free testing and treatment of all suspected COVID-19 patients.\n\nChina already set a good precedent here.  Chinese equities bottomed on the same day that daily new case numbers peaked -- **investors needed to see that the pandemic was under control before getting back into the market.**  Why?  Because we need consensus to be formed before we can have equilibrium pricing in the market, and consensus cannot be formed right now when investors snap back and forth with new information (ie. new lockdowns, new death estimates, new bankruptcies, new guidance reductions, etc).  **This snapping back and forth creates volatility and the market will never move towards equilibrium pricing.**\n\n**TDLR: Unlimited QE doesn't address the root cause of this problem, funding the healthcare system will.**",

If that expectation is not met (including any intermediate numbers that provide an indication to the worse), the market would drop further.",

Whether one was more obvious is subjective, but that it's all stemmed in greed of course it is. \n\nOh and let me add, America's pandemic is ALL thanks to trump for being too stupid to take precautionary measures to halt the spread- instead he worried about the corporations and \"assured\" people everything was fine and to keep going to work.

In 2008 there was no modern blueprint for something of this scale, it was unprecedented. This time around we know what we're doing and have a record of doing it successfully. Powell is a smart man and Bernanke made the rounds this week voicing his confidence in this being less concerning than many say. Frankly, if there's anyone I trust to weigh in on the matter it's him\n\n2) there's no major systemic reason for this downturn. In 2008 there was the mortgage bubble, in  2000 there was the dotcom bubble. In 2020 there's a growing economic shutdown due to a new pandemic. Arguably a worse situation than the others but one that will end, so long as the government is willing to spend the money to keep things afloat short term, which they've signaled they are, it will be okay.\n\nDo I think there will be further drop in the markets? Yes, dow 15k is my floor now that we have QE and stimulus going but unemployment numbers out of California spook me and I expect the dow to fall as more states announce. Do I think we'll see a long protracted fall? No, I agree with Goldmans projection of renewed growth by Q4",

The unemployment number may seem daunting but they will fall once things are under control. By \"under control\" it is either that we have a vaccine or the virus just disappears miraculously like SARS, or the infected keeps growing and given the current rate we will reach herd immunity by the end of the year (with many terrible deaths).\n\nDon't forget there's still one last move from the Feds - they can call a truce to the tradewar or even start reducing tariffs. That will boost confidence in the market almost immediately.",

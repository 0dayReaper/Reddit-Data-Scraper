    "postText": "Been working for the same fortune 25 company for last 4.5 years. During this time I\u2019ve been participating in the employee stock purchase plan. To be honest, it\u2019s not a very enticing plan as their is no discount on the stock offered. I guess I just saw it as a nice and easy passive way of investing in my company, which was performing well. I max out Roth and 401K contributions, and therefore deprioritized adding funds to my non-retirement brokerage account. The result of this is that 1 stock, my employer\u2019s stock, is now nearly 50% of my portfolio (excluding retirement). Obviously not great given my paycheck, benefits, and portfolio are now pretty dependent on the same company. My question is how best to solve the issue. \n\nOptions I see are either sell a big chunk of my company stock, pay capital gains tax and buy a broad market ETF like VTI or simply stop my contributions and put that same amount per paycheck into an ETF. Biggest issue with option 2 is simply that it would take a while to get the % of that one stock down to &lt;20% of the portfolio.",

Honestly I\u2019d dump everything as fast as possible and start buying B-road ETFs. \n\nThe levelss of risk you\u2019re exposed to is insane. Not only is your portfolio extremely concentrated, but if your job tanks so do your savings. Well my company won\u2019t fail, right? Bet the employees at Enron said the same thing.",

They may not give you a % discount, but they may allow you to buy the stock when it was cheapest during the buying period?\n\nIn any case, if there is no benefit for buying your company stock, I would first stop enrolling in your ESPP. From there, look at your taxable income, and then slowly sell some of your stock then reinvest it into a broad market ETF/MF. I would sell only some in order to a) spread out taxable gains, and b) if you qualify for certain income thresholds, you may be able to not be taxed at all. Alternatively, you could also look into doing tax-loss harvesting, selling any \"meme\" stocks that are at a loss, and off-set them by selling corresponding amount of your company stock so it's a taxable net zero.",

Since they arent giving you any sort of purchase discount, you should definitely consider halting more purchases for now.\nYou may even consider selling off some of the older shares (for ltcg taxation purposes) and resuming purchases later when you are around 5%.\nIts hard to sell when the price is going up, but if you look at it as 'taking profits' its much easier to do.",

Basically you can have after-tax money drop into here such that it equals up to 66k.\n\nSo: traditional/roth contribution + employer match + after-tax contribution = 66k\n\nWhen it's in the after-tax bucket, you typically can do an \"in-plan roth conversion\", which moves those funds into the roth type.  This is allowed because it's not a direct contribution.  This is a much better option typically than shoving after-tax $$$ into a taxable brokerage account.\n\nOnly after you've reached the 66k, then go invest in company stock or whatever else floats your boat.  For easy win, just do Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund.",

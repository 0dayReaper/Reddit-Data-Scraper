    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI know I could make an abo at tradingview for this and i really like tradingview. But I just want to know.. do you know a site or software for making technical price alerts that is free to use for multiple technical price alerts?\n\n  \nTradingview has only 1 technical alert for free. And I still don't know if I am good enough at trading for paying an abonnement right now. \n\nThe site/program should be able to make technical price alerts like if I draw a trend line, if the price hits the line I get an alert on email or something. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

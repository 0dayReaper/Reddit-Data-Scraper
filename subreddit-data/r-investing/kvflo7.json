    "postText": "Twitter shares fell as much as nearly 10% early Monday before paring some losses and trading down 6% by midday.\n\nhttps://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/01/11/tech/twitter-stock-trump-account-suspended/index.html\n\nLooking at the stock prior to any of the recent events, it hasn\u2019t really shown excessive growth since it\u2019s IPO. Interested to see if this is a good buying opportunity or this stock is stagnant and has a low chance of competing with the rest of big social media companies?",

Stocks are a good example, but it\u2019s only accessible because of established stock tickers and the search function.\n\nI mean, the only reason Reddit has survived is because of niche subreddits.

But it will even lower the engagement rate of the people that hate Trump because now they don't have their enemy to checkup on all the time and with conservatives leaving the platform, they will have less people to debate against and they will eventually start to get bored talking with people that have the same political opinion.\n\nAnd if Trump gets on another platform like he said he would, not only will his supporters follow him to the competing platform, but his haters will have to follow him there as well so that they can continue their addiction of checking up on him and making fun of him.\n\nAnd unlike the other Big Tech companies, Twitter has failed to diversify so they really cannot afford to have their user engagement rate go down.\n\nI would stay far away from Twitter stock. I think that they will eventually go the way of Myspace.",

And Trump sure as hell isn't one that is going to quietly walk away from the spotlight.\n\nTo the conservative half of the country, Trump will continue to be the loudest and most influential voice in that party for a very long time. There is no other conservative that has the following that he has, not even close.\n\nAnd to the people that hate him, well, have you ever seen that episode of \"Batman the Animated series\" where Batman apparently gets killed and after first celebrating a bit, The Joker eventually gets bored that there is no more fun with his enemy now gone? I think that if Trump did walk away from the spotlight for a while, his haters and the mainstream media would have a similar reaction. They would act like they are happy that they don't have to listen to him anymore, but deep down, there is a part of them that enjoys and is addicted to hating on him and making fun of him and they would start to miss that interaction. In that episode, The Joker eventually said: \"Without Batman, crime has no punchline.\" For Trump haters, without Trump, there also would be no punchline for them. And the media would actually have to start doing real work instead of just checking Trump's Twitter to generate the entire news for the day and nothing else that they report will generate the ratings that bashing Trump would generate. They would never be able to admit it, but just like The Joker without Batman, they won't know what to do without Trump and would go right back to obsessing over his every move as soon as he stepped back into the spotlight.",

Then there is the idea that Twitter will die without Trump. This is laughable. Trump wasn't even the largest account of Twitter.  88.7M followers. Obama has 127M. This is also entirely missing the international aspect of twitter which really doesn't care about Trump twitter. As for people getting bored? Twitter launched  15 years ago. People have been saying they would get bored with it the whole time. Why will they get bored now?",

It is still the best source for news, many times directly from the source, and covering all topics. It's still the best way for artists, politicians, athletes and many more to send a message. Twitter isn't going anywhere. The issue they have is that their ad revenue isn't as strong. People scroll thru their ads much faster than in other platforms. That said, that's something that can be addressed and I believe has been recently. One day Twitter may be obsolete and forgotten, but it won't be today nor because of Trump.",

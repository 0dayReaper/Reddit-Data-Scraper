    "postText": "I recently read an article of an individual who had a large sum of money in a target retirement fund in their regular brokerage account. At the end of the year they received a 500k capital gain resulting in needing to pay around 150k in taxes for that year. They were upset because they had to pay that large of a tax on the capital gain. \n\nCould someone explain this to me better? I understand that capital gain would be taxed as income but To me who doesn\u2019t have much knowledge on this, it would make me happy to receive 500k even if I had to pay around 150k in taxes in it cause you will still be making money. If they didn\u2019t receive this capital gain, then they wouldn\u2019t have made that income? Outside of needing to pay that tax, why else would receiving a capital gain be a negative? Thanks for the input and explanation!",

Because of this Vanguard had to liquidate a lot of positions. \n\nThis caused a huge capital gains distribution for their share holders. Target Date Funds are meant for 401ks and IRAs. This didn\u2019t effect people that held them in these accounts. But if you had a TDF in a taxable account you had a huge tax bill at the end of the year.  \n\nBut, it sounds like your confusion is in the capital gain. You don\u2019t \u201creceive\u201d the capital gain. It\u2019s not extra money. You  realize it. You already owned the money, but now you get to pay taxes on it. \n\nLet\u2019s say someone has $1mil in their account and then theirs a 20% capital gain distribution. You will now have $800k in the fund, and $200k has now been \u201cdistributed\u201d to you. Now you get to pay taxes on the $200k. It sucks. \n\nDon\u2019t put TDFs in a taxable account. ETFs are much more tax efficient. You don\u2019t realize any capital gains until you sell.",

There are long-term capital gains taxes if they are held for longer than a year, and short term capital gains taxes, which is taxed as income. \n\nCapital gains taxes only become a problem when you sell your stocks and don't have enough cash to pay the taxes. Some people will sell their stock and immediately reinvest the money without saving some cash to pay taxes.",

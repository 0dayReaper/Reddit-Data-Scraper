    "postText": "Hello! In advance, I welcome any suggestions about where to post this, if here isn't correct. Anyway:\n\nI made a poor investment several years ago, and the price of the stock has since risen in a way that I don't believe will continue. I'd like to get out now while my losses are minimized, but I transferred this stock to a different account after the initial drop. I am concerned that the IRS will think that the price at the point of transfer is what counts, and since it is now higher than that I would have to pay tax. Is this a real issue? Are there things I could/should do to get around it if it is? Thank you for helping a novice.",

I've had transfers not carry over the cost basis and just list \"tax lot not available.\" So I had to pull up the old statement from my old account and submit it so they had it for when I sold the stock.",

    "postText": "Hi guys. So basically, my mom wants to open a Roth IRA. She's currently in her mid 50s right now. What would you recommend me do? I was thinking go heavy on good dividend growth picks or purely dividend picks and and see what we can pull out at 60 or whenever she'd like to retire. She works in the beauty and cosmetology industry and is telling me she feels weak and tired and always complaining about weak bones and such. It could just be old people speak or she could genuinely be getting tired of working. Either way, I'm hoping for it to snowball and pull out sooner than later. What are your thoughts on this? And what should I go about doing?\n\nOur current financial situation: she can max out the IRA easily, we have no debt besides a car loan of 10k which will be paid off at the end of the year. No house here as she wants to retire in an Asian country which is a relatively low cost of living, you can probably get by with maybe 500 a month (even less as I'll be helping her). Has a 6 month emergency fund and decent money in a high yield savings account.",

That combined with some unsmart financial decisions from both of my parents led us here. So I'm trying my best with what I got! Either way I already plan on helping her as she helped her mom in retirement.",

I'm assuming you need to come up with $120,000, or a combination of such including what social security will pay.\n\nMy numbers aren't exact, and it would help you find a professional retirement planner.",

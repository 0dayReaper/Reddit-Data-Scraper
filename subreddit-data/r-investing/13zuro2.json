    "postText": "The money in an index fund is used to purchase shares of all the equities in the index. The underlying intrinsic value and performance of those equities will never be considered by the shareholders.\n\nAs many are quick to point out, most big cap stocks are currently heavily overpriced. For example, [Pepsi](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP?p=PEP) currently costs $38.67 per $1 of profit today. Who would pay that price for a company that only [grows](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP/analysis?p=PEP) ~8% per year at best? Its top three [shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP/holders?p=PEP) are Vanguard, State Street and Black Rock.\n\nHow much of the blame for overpricing goes to passive investors who shovel money into everything regardless of its value or performance? I'm perfectly guilty of this myself of course.\n\nPassive investors dream of cashing out on that compounded 9.1%/year growth of the S&amp;P 500 over time, and we can all backtest and see that past performance. But we can't really backtest the ever-increasing observer effect that index investing must have over time.\n\nTo get to the point, at what point does the S&amp;P 500 simply track the performance of index funds and render the stock market a meaningless Ponzi scheme? Or have I simply gone bonkers to think about this, and if so, what am I missing?\n\nCharlie Munger has often [pointed out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tojx4J2HYD4) that index investing doesn't work if everyone does it. Are any economists studying the notion that index investing itself is poisoning the market averages that seem harder and harder for stock pickers to beat every decade?",

Who would pay that price for a company that only grows ~8% per year at best? Its top three shareholders are Vanguard, State Street and Black Rock.\n\nBased on my math, a company that produces $1 in earnings this year and grows its earnings every year by 8% for the next 100 years (and then makes zero in earnings afterward) will be worth $38.67 at a discount rate of 10.26%. This means that purchasing this share today for $38.67 gives an expected return of 10.26% per year. Considering the risk free rate is around 4% now, the market would be pricing in a risk premium of over 6% above the market. I definitely wouldn't call that \"heavily overpriced.\" We could debate whether a company like Pepsi will be able to continue to grow at 8% per year for 100 years, but I'm just using your assumption.\n\nTo answer your bigger question, as more and more people invest passively, the opportunity for active managers to make money by injecting information into the market increases. This creates a negative feedback loop. More active managers get involved in the market, making profit by injecting more information into the market, increasing the efficiency of the market, decreasing the ability of the active managers to make more profit, increasing the amount of people who invest passively, and continuing the cycle.",

Who knows, but it's a really surprising result.",

My main point was to show that OP's assumption of \"only 8%\" growth is nothing to scoff at, and if we assume that growth rate for the long term, the current price makes perfect sense.\n\nPerhaps a better conclusion based on OP's broader question is, if the S&amp;P 500 continues to grow at 8% per year over the long term, it could be expected to provide a return above 10% per year for the long term. The P/E of the S&amp;P 500 is below that of Pepsi, so it actually would need less than 8% growth to reach the same 10.26% return. \n\nI've tried to find information on Coca Cola's earnings, and I can't find anything further back than 1984. Over the last 38 years, Coca Cola has grown its earnings by 7.4% per year annualized [(628 million in 1984 to 9.5 billion in 2022)](https://ycharts.com/companies/KO/net_income_annual). It's not like Coca Cola was unheard of by the 1980s. So 8% per year might not be that impossible. Inflation running hot in the 1980s probably helped a bit.",

The S&amp;P 500 is a basket of approximately 500 stocks that changes every year. A committee decides what to add and what to remove. The funny part about this is that the index is fundamentally a \"buy high, sell low\" operation. A company needs to be already quite successful to be added to the index, and it's removed when it is less successful.\n\nI'm not sure if it's still true, but a while ago there was a study showing that if you bought the original set of companies in the S&amp;P 500 but didn't follow the index over time, you would have outperformed the index, even considering that many of those companies went bankrupt. It's because several large companies were removed at one point for doing poorly, then re-added sometime later when they were doing better.

It makes a lot of sense that if the entire country is moving away from pensions and going towards index investing, that that would have an upward lift to the indexes over that time frame. Because remember, very few workers doing this new index retirement investing we're actually retiring. They were working. So you had almost every working person in the country buying and not selling. That is a tremendous upward lift.\n\nBut now, the first of those people who did index investing are finally retiring. And over time, more and more of the people who were working and index investing for retirement will begin to retire. We will reach something of an equilibrium, where no longer will we have a massive group of people buying, and almost no one selling. Now we will have more equal buying and selling. To me, that says the huge upward drift is probably coming to an end.",

However, the sheer number of investors and amount of money involved make it impossible for everyone to consistently beat the market.\n\nAs for your question about whether index fund investing could turn the stock market into a Ponzi scheme - I don't think we're there yet. The market is far too large and complex, and companies still need to perform in order to attract capital. Sure, passive investing has an effect, but it's not the only factor at play.\n\nYour concern isn't baseless though, and it's certainly something economists are studying. How exactly it will all play out is tough to say. But for now, as far as most individual investors are concerned, index funds still offer a relatively simple, low-cost way to get broad exposure to the market.\n\nThe key is to stay informed, stay adaptable, and never stop asking tough questions. I often found myself checking articles like [Motley Fool vs Morningstar](https://joywallet.com/article/motley-fool-vs-morningstar/), trying to suss out different perspectives on this issue.",

Who would pay that price for a company that only grows \\~8% per year at best? Its top three shareholders are Vanguard, State Street and Black Rock.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;How much of the **blame for overpricing goes to passive investors who shovel money into everything** regardless of its value or performance? I'm perfectly guilty of this myself of course.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Passive investors dream of cashing out on that compounded 9.1%/year growth** of the S&amp;P 500 over time, and we can all backtest and see that past performance. But we can't really backtest the ever-increasing observer effect that index investing must have over time.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To get to the point, at what point does the S&amp;P 500 simply track the performance of index funds and render the stock market a meaningless Ponzi scheme? Or have I simply gone bonkers to think about this, and if so, what am I missing?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Charlie Munger has often pointed out that index investing doesn't work if **everyone** does it. Are any economists studying the notion that index investing itself is poisoning the market averages that seem harder and harder for stock pickers to beat every decade?",

There's also so many indexes constructed in ways to go in every which way direction regardless of economic output. I dont think every generation can expect returns like we got wholly in equities for the past two decades, but I don't think chasing yield is the reason to index invest.\n\nIf you really know industry, and finance, and accounting, and consumers, and skilled management, by all means take ownership in a profitable enterprises, rebalance, look for opportunities, pay attention to filings...\n\nA person can do NONE of that, and achive \"market returns\". Sure they may not be as great as our 12%-14% CAGR, but they will get 6% and the argument remains the same. The point is to save and accumulate wealth by purchasing productive assets that grow with the world economy because cash loses value on it's own. If not inflation it's opportunity cost. If not that it's the simple human desire for present consumption over future consumption. \n\nCertain index funds and trust units are such where the whole instrument is traded as a single security, which I don't think affects the underlying, but there is definitely a concern with so many mutual funds basketing the same stocks and having x stock on the s&amp;p shopping list props the price up higher than an equal stock that's overlooked by not being included in an index. Over a long period of time whose to say there wont be heavy lobbying by corporations to get included into an index and enjoy the sweet inflow of ignorant money?\n\nAgain, it's not an insult to say indexing/diversification is risk management for those who don't know what their doing...yeah people do NOT know what their doing lol its good advice to live your life, work and buy a slice of capitalism that in the long run will HAVE to favor a productive result = growth in wealth.\n\nRegarding what Charlie said, idk the context but lets assume theres a world index weighted fairly size or whatever, everyone investing into that world index isn't going to stop the world economy from growing? How does everybody investing reduce output? Sure everyone buying the same amount of the same all the time means that there is less opportunity, and share of that output is more expensive, but since everyone is benefitting from the same goods and service production where will the perpetual money come from to create a stock market bubble? If there are crashed it would be directly related to the economic cycle. \n\nThere might be stuff I missed but I typed too much",

For example, you suggest than index funds make certain S&amp;P 500 companies overpriced based on a poor cost to profit ratio.   If this is truly accurate, then various managed funds takes advantage of that opportunity by buying underpriced funds and/or shorting overpriced funds, which corrects the price.

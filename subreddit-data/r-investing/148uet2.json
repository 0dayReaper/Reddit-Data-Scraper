If you know of any that I can add to my watch list then please let me know. My hopes are that I can build a diverse portfolio of different options and monthly dividend earners are something I am lacking as of right now. My target range is an annual return around or above 8%. Thanks for any inputs.",

            "comment": "You could put together a mix of 8-10 REITs (in different sectors) and get a yield of about 7% annualized.  You could then sell covered calls against these and earn another 2%-3% annualized.  (Yes, you could earn much higher covered call returns but you'd have to write those calls so close to the stocks' price that you'd be constantly getting your stocks called away, thus defeating the purpose.)  Then you could add on a few MLPs (energy) and get roughly a 10% yield.  So, you could have 12-15 positions with an overall yield of about 10% (which includes the covered call income).  Now, you're concentrated in energy and real estate but you're not in anything too nutso.  I wouldn't put all of my eggs in this type of basket, of course.  (I'm doing this, for full disclosure.)\n\nBut consider the source... I just bought some 6.25% IEP bonds with a YTM of almost 11%.  So maybe that's a bit nutso.  I don't know what to make of the stock, exactly, but I think Carl will pay off his debt come hell or high water.  We'll see.",

You don't go into dividend investing for the short term, you want those compounding gains from the dividend growing your shares. Dividend investing is a long term strategy.\n\nThough if you're young, you really want to tilt more growth than dividend as growth will outperform. Dividend investing is really for when you're in or nearing retirement.\n\nI say this as someone who 75% total US market equivalent and about 5-10% dividend tilted.",

    "postText": "The AI definitely would replace the employee working force. For example if for one job were needed 10 people, now 5 people would do it. \n\nSo what would be the outcome: \n\n1. Will the companies make massive lay-offs and therefore increase the unemployment a lot, so there would be very low consumer spending because a lot of people would be jobless, so the companies will lower their sales/revenues.\n2. The companies will not make lay-offs and would keep and pay the same salary to the employees who would work much less, like in 8 hour working time they would work for like 3-4 hours and get the same salary as before when they worked 8 hours because AI would be doing their job for them. But in this case the companies will have so much unnecessary salary expenses.\n\nPlease share your opinions.",

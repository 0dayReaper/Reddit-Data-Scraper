    "postText": "This is a sort of follow-on post to one I had posted yesterday about moving out from one MF into another one based on their relative performance. Historically, I've been little conservative and cautious with my Equity MF investments, and if the choice were between lower volatility, lower standard-deviation and slightly higher returns, I might choose the former (although it might be a short-sighted and incorrect view). Which is why I think I had been clinging on to B for last 3.5yrs, but I think it is time to switch to A. Given the graphic table (external imgur link below) comparing 2 MFs, A and B, is there any reason to hang onto B ?\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/u70xCyj",

            "comment": "Do the funds share the same objective in their prospectus?  based on the returns, fund A only has the outsized performance due to something its done in the past year.  are these funds that track US stocks?  My guess is prior to this year, it likely returned similar numbers than B.  \n\nCan it recreate that consistently?  maybe.  this is where chance really takes hold.  just because a fund skirted some market losses or made a right bet in the near term, their ability to continue is largely given to chance.   There is a reason persistence is almost non-existent in mutual funds.  especially large cap growth.     \n\n\nI think its Bill Bernstein who said \"investors lose when they begin to look at the rearview mirror\"",

The high level stated objectives of both funds is same, but their current sectoral distribution is a bit different. I've not checked (rather haven't found the data) on how their sectoral allocations have evolved over the years. One has slightly greater emphasis on Energy, Automotive industry and Services industry, while other has slightly greater emphasis on Financial Industry and Technology, but the difference is not more than 3-4% per sector. Most of the sectors in their portfolio are common, and within 0.5-1% difference (other than the ones mentioned above). I am assuming here that the fund A, is performing better because it has a better Fund Manager, who is paid better and the person has been busy making the right bets. Trying to see if there is something more to look at, when considering this shift from B to A, more objectively.",

In my country the expense ratio difference and relative performance of index funds vs actively managed funds isn't quite what it is like in the US. In fact, the pure index funds seem to slightly underperform compared to these actively managed large-cap funds (so far).",

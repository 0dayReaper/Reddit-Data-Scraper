    "postText": "I have a solo 401k and contribute as both an employee and employer. I accidentally over-contributed for 2022 by $6,498. From what I've researched, I need to file a form 5330, Return of Excise Taxes. However, I received an extension this year and haven't yet filed my state or federal return. Is there anything I can do to amend the overpayment before filing that will prevent me from having to file the 5330?",

Last year, I paid accidentally $2000 over Roth IRA and my CPA suggested me to pay penalty 6% rather than withdrawing it and I paid.\n\nCheck with your CPA.",

    "postText": "Any ideas on how to play the GTA6 release? Articles state that potential release date is fiscal year 2025, so end of 2024-early 2025. I want to enter a long position because I believe the stock will slowly rise up until the game is dropped + rumors that the game will break revenue records. I was thinking of grabbing 2025 LEAPS, or a bunch of shares and holding them. Should I wait until more news is announced about the game, or does this buy-and-hold plan sound fine? Also, buy stocks or LEAPS for this?",

            "comment": "You can buy 100 shares of TTWO outright for ~$13,750 and sell monthly calls against it. Another way to play it is a diagonal call spread by buying 5 Jan-17-25 135 Calls and selling 4 Jul-21-23 145 Calls for about the same amount of money (~$13,770), and still roll the short calls as expiration comes along. I like the diagonal spreads as I get the ability of rolling both sides and minimize risk along the way.",

We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel. \n\nCryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment. \n\nTesla will not be selling any Bitcoin and we intend to use it for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy. \n\nWe are also looking at other cryptocurrencies that use &lt;1% of Bitcoin's energy/transaction.\"\n\nBitcoin down 6% at pixel.",

Really ask yourself have you ever used it as currency and would you or are you looking at it as a form of investment like gold (a shiny rock in my opinion).   The point of crypto is to get away from fiat currency but everyone is pretty pissed that\u2019s it\u2019s value in fiat went down . One Bitcoin is still one Bitcoin so what\u2019s the problem ?",

If someone is stoked on crypto for it's potential to replace fiat currency but then is all kinds of stoked about BTC-USD nearly hitting $65K or upset about it dropping, how do you rationalize that? Shouldn't you not give a flying fuck how much USD you can get for your BTC holdings if you believe it will replace USD as the currency of choice?\n\nSeems disingenuous. I'd respect it a lot more if someone just said \"look, it's a cool idea and I'd like to see it pan out, but if it doesn't I'm also happy to make a solid profit on the hype.\"",

                                    "comment": "I'll give it a quick pitch.  I'd argue that by a number of metrics, ETH is already bigger than BTC, and has room to grow.\n\nETH has a number of places creating demand that will drive price up in a sustainable way: as capital for staking; collateral for on-chain decentralized lending; and to pay for transactions on the network.  \n\nAdditionally, the upcoming lockdown of it's monetary policy will potentially make it deflationary.\n\n---\n\n**Staking:** Ethereum's Proof of Stake [\"beacon chain\"](https://beaconcha.in/) went live last november, and already has over $15 billion worth of ETH staked.  \n\nThe people running those validators (equivalent of miners) are currently being paid around 6% APY (ETH-denominated).  Attractiveness of that has been creating a sink on the circulating supply.\n\n*(Technically PoS isn't in control of Ethereum's consensus yet -- the changeover from PoW is currently being tested, but targetting Q4-21)*.\n\n---\n\n**Collateral:** Ethereum has a huge ecosystem running on-chain.  One of the backbones of that is lending protocols like MakerDAO, Aave, and Compound.  \n\nAt the base, many of these are powered by people locking up their Ethereum as collateral, creating another sink on the circulating supply. \n\nDeFi currently has approximately [$78 billion](https://defipulse.com/) worth of collateral lock up on chain.\n\n---\n\n**Transactions:** ETH has to be used to pay for transactions on the network.  And it's doing more business than Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum has infamously high fees right now, but that's just because people are literally in a bidding war to get their transactions on-chain.  Fees used to be &lt; 1 cent, but then the network got popular.  (There have been continual upgrades to increase it's capacity, but demand just keeps increasing to keep pace.  There are plenty more upgrades on the way).\n\nCase in point for popularity is https://cryptofees.info/ -- look how much people are bidding to access the Ethereum network, compared even to Bitcoin (much less other coins).  I'd note -- all the rows in pink aren't other chains, those are projects running *on Ethereum*, which are generating their own fees on top of Ethereum transaction fees.\n\nAnother argument is the velocity of money https://money-movers.info/ -- Ethereum is already moving billions more per day than Bitcoin, and it's increasing.\n\n---\n\n**Monetary Policy** is being locked down, and is projected to become deflationary. \n\nPoW block rewards are currently increasing supply at around 4-5% per year.  However, once PoS takes over later this year, inflation will drop down to around 1%, due to the increased efficiency and lower costs of the tech.\n\nMore importantly though is Ethereum's London upgrade coming in July. Among other things, this will implement a \"burn\" where a portion of the ETH fee for each transaction will be destroyed.  **Think of the burn like a perpetual stock buyback based on a % of gross revenue** -- see cryptofees above for an idea of the gross.\n\nEstimates are that this will burn the supply by around 0-3% per year, starting in July.  Note that when combined with the PoS upgrade, this means Ethereum's supply is estimated to be slowly deflating by 0-2% starting next year, and continuing indefinitely.\n\nStaking, combined with the burn, is what has had a whole lot of people squirrelling away ETH as fast as they can.\n\n---\n\n\\*edit\\*:  Oh yeah, I should have mentioned: \n\n**Smart Contracts:** One of the main reasons Ethereum's Decentralized Finance (DeFi) movement is so huge is because of smart contracts. \n\nA lot of the lending projects I mentioned above (like MakerDAO and Aave) have people lending &amp; borrow collateral.  Why are they willing to do this? Because smart contracts mean they can perform their daily operations on-chain, and people can borrow and lend *without anyone having to trust a middleman custodian* -- since the smart contracts provide the trust, and Ethereum secures it. \n\nThis opens up a huge set of opportunities for financial operations to take place beyond simple \"let me move coins from A to B\" -- borrowing, lending, derivatives, NFTs, you name it.  And Ethereum literally pioneered the field here.  It's the reason the network exists.",

It felt nice to try and write it all up :)\n\nOne of the (advantages / disadvantages) of Ethereum is that the project is extremely decentralized. The most coordinated part are the developers, who like typical coders, are really focused on the protocol.  \n\nFrom the marketing / investment side of things, everything's very ad-hoc, with different groups each slowly working up their own materials.  \n\nI know one of the other Ethereum reddits has started up https://ethmerge.com/ with some information as well, but haven't been able to give it a good readover yet.",

Cryptos have largely gone unregulated much like the wild west. While a lot of the biggest names are legitimate there are also a near infinite number of scammers and scam coins. Even the legitimate players might be doing underhanded things without regulation and likely won't be punished retroactively (even real wall street execs didn't pay for the housing crash). Those who went into crypto know (or at least should know) the risks and what they are getting themselves into.",

Though I think it would have gone higher anyways, Elon helped pump BTC from 34K-64K with the Tesla news.  He's one of the most influential people in the world and this will spark conversations for weeks on this.\n\nETH is already halfway to BTC's market cap.  This could legitimately lead to the \"flippening\" ETH folks have been wanting for so long.  Why?  Because ETH is moving to PoS (Proof of Stake) which uses far, far less energy than Bitcoin's PoW (Proof of Work), which is the respective ways the networks achieve security and decentralization.",

During probably the most delicate time of Tesla's development he starts all that dumb 420 bullshit, opens the company up to SEC fines. Later while the stock is suffering after massive growth and trying to stay afloat he piles into bitcoin and then starts shit talking the asset on twitter. Now all of a sudden when growth stocks get raped and crypto goes with it, he's a champion for fossil fuels cutbacks. Give me a fucking break. I mean I will agree that our current financial system handles trillions of more transactions globally and probably more efficient than BTC ever could but to type that bull shit into a statement is just ridiculous to me. \n\nWere talking about a guy who wants to transfer the entirety of the US vehicle fleet onto the electrical grid who NEWS FLASH is 40% natural gas and 20% coal currently.\n\nIt's a yikes from me.",

Also the devaluation of alot of countries currency (see Nigeria my home country) makes something like bitcoin very important. Gold isn't an option there for villagers and farmers (also if someone sees you with gold, you will definitely be mugged and killed) however literally everyone there has a smart phone. \n\nAlthough they banned btc it is still widely used there, however they stopped inflows of USD and that can actually be enforced by the Nigerian government and the US government. BTC isn't for US citizens its for the rest of the world whose currency is backed by the Dollar which is backed by a government printing trillions of dollars. \n\nI think of other countries currencies as leveraged dollars we dilute they get diluted more.",

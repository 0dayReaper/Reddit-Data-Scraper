Imagine if you bought when it was $1. You're telling me that you wouldn't sell when it hit $100, $500, $1000, $2500, $5000? Takes a lot of discipline to do so.\n\nFrom what I've read, a lot of people who are rich today off bitcoin are rich because they had some stupid sum of worthless bitcoin and forgot about it. Or they discovered they had 5 bitcoins as \"play\" money.",

He said they were really easy to get right now and he already had 15 on his shitty laptop and that I should do it. I told him he was fuckin nuts and forgot all about it. He kept mining tho but I haven't talked to him in years tho so I'm not sure where he sold.\n\nSo yeah, I still kick myself in the ass for that one.

It was convenient as all mighty hell and gave consumers freedom to buy single songs versus having to buy whole albums or \u201csingle discs.\u201d For those with decent incomes, it was a great deal. \n\nIn short, it wasn\u2019t Napster that killed Tower Records.

Other stores like AllOfMP3 didn't have the mainstream appeal due to questionable legality, and Amazon didn't start selling digital music until Late 2007. That was also the launch of the original iPhone and iPod Touch, at which point Smart Phones would start deplacing portable music players.\n\nSo the Zune was just a bit too late, without a good legal music ecosystem, and not that interesting to people ripping (or otherwise \"acquiring\") their collections, as those would prefer bigger hard drive players like the [Creative NOMAD Jukebox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nomad.jpg) (6 GB, released a year before the original iPod) and especially the 20 GB, $300 Jukebox 3 from 2002.",

Same time frame AAPL has done $1 to $200, so actually just a little lag behind. I'm sure you could find some company that beats both though.",

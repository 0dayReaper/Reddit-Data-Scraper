    "postText": "Is it considered a washed sale if I sell a losing investment such as uvxy and realize a capital gain by selling another stock such as my AMD stock, and then use the combined funds from the sale of both stocks to repurchase AMD stock within 30 days? Is there a name for that? Is that illegal? Will it incur any penalties come tax season?",

Did you **replace** them within 30 days before or after?\n\nIf \"Yes./Yes.\", you have a wash sale.  Doesn't matter how old the original shares were.  Doesn't matter where the money came from.  Doesn't matter if they're at a same or different brokerage.\n\n(Or my pet peeve: doesn't matter if the replacement shares came as a dividend reinvestment: still a wash sale.)",

And I'm not repurchasing losing shares, I'm repurchasing winning shares.\n\nSo I'm not sure whether or not it's a Washed sale.",

Without AMD in the mix, you could subtract the loss from other dividends/capital gains first and then if you still have leftover losses, up to 3k against your regular earnings which may be a better deal for most people.  Over 3k is carried over to the next year.  Your mileage may vary.",

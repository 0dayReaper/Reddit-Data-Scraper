I used to work at a bank that lent money to GEO and they made the decision to exit that space like 6 years ago because they didn't want to be associated with the negative headlines. Other banks viewed the space differently and continued lending, but as headline risk ebbs and flows over time the calculus changes on whether or not these loans are worth making to the broader institution. Guess JPM finally felt it was time to call it quits.\n\nI don't know if it will make a big impact though. GEO &amp; CoreCivic are both heavy issuers of bonds and/or leverage loans. The institutional market generally isn't as worry about headline risk as banks. If GEO / Core can't get a deal done with their banks they'll just shift more debt from the bank market to the institutional markets. ",

Reading between the lines I think it's far more likely that it was a financial decision, the ethical PR spin is just a bonus.\n\nI'd argue that they are not mutually exclusive.\n\n The bank sees public opinion turning against for-profit  prisons.They look at the moral mutual funds and pension funds that have divested from \"immoral industries\" (like weapon manufacturers, fossil fuels and defense) and fear that private prisons will find themselves on the black list. They made the financial decision that distancing themselves from private prisons will increase their future returns. \n\n Instead of being associated with private prisons, and losing potential revenue, they decided to publically announce that they no longer have any future dealings with the industry. \n\nThis is one of the features of capitalism... \n\nEdit: Deleted the last sentence because it was needlessly political.

GEO and CoreCivic will defend their position by claiming they do offer the same detention services at a lower price, but studies have shown this doesn't always apply consistently across states and cases. While you are right in some cases private prisons do save the government money, the bigger value GEO and CoreCivic provide is really in their ability to provide beds / capacity to states and the federal government rapidly and / or that are built to spec.\n\nYou can see this in GEO's most recent earnings call transcript. The State of Idaho recently signed an emergency contract with GEO for the housing of approximately 700 medium-security inmates at GEO's Eagle Pass facility because Idaho didn't have enough space for them in their existing state fun facilities. This GEO facility was previously idle and represented open capacity available to Idaho immediately. Similarly, GEO completed the construction of a new facility for ICE recently that provides 1,000 new beds (Congress has been increasing the amount of beds assigned to ICE recently), and the same facility was built to also withstand a Category 5 hurricane, provides office space for 170 ICE staff and can serve as an emergency command center. This facility checks two boxes for ICE as providing them the beds they need while also being built to spec for a secondary mission as an emergency command center.\n\nIdaho and ICE could have theoretically do it all themselves, but it's often easier to outsource it to specialists.

Many states turn to private prisons because they need beds within a short period of time and don't have the resources to fund the construction / update of their own prisons. Private companies can fill that void and build incremental beds rapidly and often at more affordable prices because they have existing idle facilities. The reality is these private prisons largely provide services that fulfill BoP and ICE mandates. These mandates are established by the government itself, so the government itself has  always struck me as a better place to being trying to solve the problem of private prisons rather than going after lenders. If private prisons are shuttered overnight most states simply don't have the capacity to take the influx of prisoners. The lack of beds at govt owned facilities continues to be the engine that drives growth at GEO and CoreCivic. The situation is only expected to get worse as time goes on as existing govt owned facilities continue to age and approach their useful life. Remember that NY prison that made news recently because of no heat and water during Christmas? That was govt owned and run and reflective of the aging facilities in many states that don't have the resources to provide massive upgrades / build new facilities.\n\nGranted, private prisons aren't perfect and like any industry lobby for their interests, which opens the door for perverse incentives to exist, but that isn't unique to private prisons as it exists with all industries who are able to lobby the government and influence policy to their benefit.",

It just means our campaign finance / lobbying rules are screwed up. Just as a private prison company can lobby unjustly for tighter drug sentences, so too can an energy company lobby for looser environmental regulations. Shutting down the prison company as a result doesn't strike me as equitable, nor does it really solve that issue specifically. Plus, if you shut down the private prisons we're still in the same position where we need to figure out where to put all the prisoners once the private prisons are shuttered and the various states and federal facilities don't have capacity to take them. It also kind of ignores the fact these organizations have been building additional capacity in order to satisfy evolving ICE mandates and new BoP procurements (CAR 19) that again originate with the government itself due to an intrinsic lack of beds owned by the government relative to the prison population. Heck, Idaho just had to sign an emergency contract with GEO because they needed beds for prisoners and didn't have enough themselves so had to outsource.\n\nPut differently, I don't view wanting to eliminate the war on drugs, enacting prison reform, addressing mass incarceration, and limiting lobbying efforts as necessarily mutually exclusive to understanding the value some private prisons provide. Likewise, understanding the benefits private prisons provide doesn't mean they are wonder organizations without need of reform, monitoring, and regulation. Just kindly pointing out there is some nuance to the issue beyond a small cabal of folks immorally ripping huge profits off prisoners.",

Basically they are going out to the market and saying \"hey we need XYZ number of beds, please send us your bids and we will decide which bid makes the most sense for us and award these beds via contracts as appropriate\".\n\nSo it's the government going out and demanding beds based on budgets established by Congress and mandates / policy objectives set by the Department of Justice. \n\nTotally agree about the perverse incentives that exist, but again, that applies to every industry. Whacking the private prison industry with some frontier justice while allowing all other industries to continue lobbying for their own benefit under the same perverse set of incentives doesn't really make sense to me -- I'd much rather the lobbying issue be fixed across the board as it fixes a widespread societal issue equitably rather than playing favorites industry by industry. Furthermore, I'm not so sure eliminating private prisons will necessarily usher in a new era of prison reform in of itself, particularly because 1) private prisons primarily house ICE detainees whom aren't drug offenders which is the big prison reform issue, 2) drug reform has been occurring across the US despite the rise of private prisons, and 3) because the total number of adults incarcerated in state and federal custody has been declining despite the financial rise of private prisons: https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cpus16.pdf &amp; http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/02/americas-incarceration-rate-is-at-a-two-decade-low/\n\nI can understand why people include private prisons in their reform visions, and to be frank maybe that's a fair policy approach because even a small improvement might be beneficial to society -- I'm not nieve to think private prisons can do no wrong and am certainly not trying to communicate that -- but to that same end I don't see why one can't be *pro* prison &amp; mandatory sentencing reform while still utilizing private prisons supply necessary capacity to the government.\n\nI'm not trying to die on a hill for private prisons, at the end of the day I don't really care, I guess I just don't see it all as mutually exclusive.

Just pointing out in this thread that we currently lack significant beds at the government level, and abolishing private prisons does nothing to solve our supply-demand imbalance. While Congress could allocate incremental funds to the DOJ/BoP, many states simply don't have the resources to rapidly fill the void in the number of beds that eliminating private prisons would create. That's really the first step we need to address before we can rationally debate the moral and economic role private prisons should or could play in our society.",

But beyond that I'm not a political scientist or sociologist qualified to opine on the best way to reform our prisons. \n\nOne thing to clarify though just to be clear, is that GEO and CoreCivic don't sentence people themselves, the court's obviously handle that. They just take inmate flow as it comes, so the conflict of interest isn't exactly direct. Furthermore, both company's biggest customer is ICE which typically involves temporarily housing inmates who have been captured, who need to processed, and then are released back into the general population for a court date on a later date.\n\nThe issue arises when companies are able to lobby the government -- naturally the door is open for someone like GEO or CoreCivic to support the campaigns of those who support significantly harsher sentencing as a means of boosting their own financial profile. I am sure this occurs and that certainly represents an indirect conflict that we should seek to solve from a societal perspective. That said, the data shows prison populations have been declining over the past handful of years despite the rise of private prisons, so I'm not so sure that direct conflict is as strong as many purport.

Contracts to manage these prisons private prisons come up for rebid once the expire and obviously the company's track record while running the prison has a direct impact in how likely they are to win a recompete. For prisons they own, the BoP puts out regular procurements for beds to outsource the prisoner census and again track record matters. Federal and ICE facilities only have the resources provided to them by Congressional budgets, and for a lot of state facilities there is no funding or seriously constrained funding to provide improvements or new facilities. You may recall over Christmas a prison in NY made headlines because it had no heat and water during freezing temperatures. That was a federally run prison.....sure there exists no profit motive, but yet it still resulted in horrid conditions, so to some extent eliminating the profit incentive doesn't guarantee anything is fixed.",

The answer to running better prisons likely lies in some combination of improved regulation, oversight, and funding. Making everything private or everything publicly funded and operated won't guarantee all the problems are magically fixed as both systems have resulted in their own share of scandals. A good prison system can exist with private operation of the prisons as well as public, as can a twisted one.\n\nTo reiterate, the private prison system exists because government run facilities don't have enough capacity to fulfill their current needs. As a result, they turn to private prisons. If we eliminate private prisons on account of them not being safe, we have no where to put the prisoners they are holding and only exacerbate the lack of beds issue at govt run facilities. So to that end it doesn't solve the current problem. As a result, I totally agree that improvements can be made and probably SHOULD be made at private prisons to make them safer and better -- but that view doesn't need to exist mutually exclusive of the existence of private prisons.",

In 2008, judges Michael Conahan and Mark Ciavarella were accused of accepting money in return for imposing harsh adjudications on juveniles to increase occupancy at for-profit detention centers.Ciavarella disposed thousands of children to extended stays in youth centers for offenses as trivial as mocking an assistant principal on Myspace or trespassing in a vacant building. After a judge rejected an initial plea agreement in 2009, a federal grand jury returned a 48-count indictment. In 2010, Conahan pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and was sentenced to 17.5 years in federal prison.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/investing/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Yes, the National Socialist Workers Party of Germany, otherwise known as the Nazi Party, was indeed socialist and it had a lot in common with the modern left. Hitler preached class warfare, agitating the working class to resist \u201cexploitation\u201d by capitalists , particularly Jewish capitalists, of course. Their programs called for the nationalization of education, health care, transportation, and other major industries. They instituted and vigorously enforced a strict gun control regimen. They encouraged pornography, illegitimacy, and abortion, and they denounced Christians as right-wing fanatics. Yet a popular myth persists that the Nazis themselves were right-wing extremists. This insidious lie biases the entire political landscape today.",

A total of 22 thousand prisoners, 1% of the 2.2 million locked up at the time. The other 85 percent are either in DHS facilities, or other facilities the CIA illegally renditioned.\n\nWhat is rarely pointed out, at the same time ICE had literally three or four days before the announcement awarded then CCA a billion dollar contract to \"detain\" central american immigrants seeking asylum. This contract gave CCA 20 million a month whether or not there was a single immigrant in the facility. The Federal courts ended up ruling the government could not detain immigrants but instead had to house them in the least restrictive manner. That meant we were paying millions a month of tax dollars for empty prisons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the Obama administration was so against private prisons, why did the executive order only apply to the DoJ and not the other agencies that were totally under his control?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

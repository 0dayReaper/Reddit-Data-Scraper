Can you do something else with it?  That\u2019s what an investment is to me, not land banking unless you see massive growth (in price) in the future.  \n\nJust me though\n\nHowever, if you get enjoyment out of it and you can afford it, do it if you want.  Not sure of the financial investment benefits, but you\u2019ll have emotional, spiritual, etc most likely.  \n\nGood luck!",

But in the US you can lease land to a local farmer and have him hay the field a few times a year. Where I'm from there are farmers that will do that to stock up on hay for the livestock in the winter months. And you get a hefty tax break on the property taxes.",

If real estate hasn't already boomed on PEI, ask why it hasn't, and whether you expect those conditions to change in your favor soon enough to make the investment profitable.\n\nRemote locations like PEI can be really expensive due to practical challenges, like high materials and fuel cost, higher utilities, more weatherization (if you're near the coast), installing utility hookups, septic system vs sewer, etc.\n\nProperty ownership is a lot of work, and time alone doesn't make it worthwhile from a strictly investment perspective. You gotta decide if enjoyment of the property alone is enough to make up for the investment becoming unprofitable.",

I stopped looking at it like an investment and now am kinda in a holding pattern. Either put up a ton of capital to develop which would prob be going to other investments or sell which I don\u2019t wanna do so I watch the insane gains get eaten up by taxes. \n\nRambling point being, and I\u2019m sure your much better with investing then me I\u2019m re re with that stuff, have a solid plan for this property to generate return. Purchasing, placing a family heirloom cottage on it then trying to balance air bnb management with constant family trips is not an investment per se but it is a very nice luxury to have if your not dependent on revenue generation.",

I bought very cheap, so for me it's worth it.

Does it produce or is it for urbanistic development? If it produces... how much? If it's for urbanistoc development... how many years until it's ready? What are your local regulations and how much does local politics affect your land value? \n \nAs investment it's good, but you must do your due diligence.

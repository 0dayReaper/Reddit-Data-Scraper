That fraction is used to help calculate the penalty for lawbreaking.  It makes sense in theory, because unethical banks would do the opposite calculation when analyzing whether it would be profitable break the law.  In order to be effective, a penalty does need to bring the probable profit of crime below zero, and to calculate that effective penalty you either need an estimate of the risk of getting caught, or impose a penalty so massive that it eclipses the benefits of crime.  Nobody is treated unfairly in either case, except potentially the sample of businesses that are intensively audited for the study, and that is an administrative inconvenience not a legal one.",

Let\u2019s say an average person drives 12 times peer week (5 day commute + one trip every weekday). That means everyone who owns a car should get 3 speeding tickets per week, indefinitely.

The Germans thought national will would give them victory but we had a big economy. So it turns out the economy is really important.\n\nBut it's gone past the point where it is a useful concept. If we forget WHY the economy is good then we will prioritize the economy over people not understanding that the reason we have an economy is for the happiness and strength of our people. A country without grandparents will be weak and will lose much of the cement that binds it and makes it strong.\n\nNational will is now more important than ever. It will determine whether we defeat this virus as the Asian countries have done or whether we will succumb, and permanently scar the national psyche and lose our confidence that we as Americans are capable of overcoming all problems that the world throws at us.",

Kudos to you, and thank you for providing.\n\nMy only question is what authority has the power or is willing to provide oversight on numbers reported by the CCP? Seems western journalists are capped and/or not allowed to enter key areas for accurate reporting. And this issue goes far beyond the virus. I, and I certainly hope for others as well, cannot reliably use economic output reported by the CCP neither. My firm has an entire macro team dedicated to sorting ground up data from China so we can better understand what\u2019s happening on the ground whether it be CPI, PMI, anything really. And it\u2019s a full time job for them! Anyways, I appreciate your response and wholeheartedly share the same sentiment.\n\nEdit: I believe the mobile data you\u2019re referencing are active users on China Mobile (cellular service company), which indicate a drop in usage from December of over 8mm users. Mind blowing. The optimist in me says a large part of this number can hopefully be allocated to robots.",

I expect more authoritarian crackdowns on dissidence.  When you can't feed your population, and there is no work, then society crumbles.\n\nFurthermore, with the internet, it is more difficult for the CCP to totally censor the reality of the situation.\n\nUSA has a couple of strategic resources: food, and fresh water.  Although the USA has no meaningful domestic manufacturing capability at this point, they can feed their population.  I expect 18-36 months of economic contraction and 5-7 years to return to our current GDP.  I think the USA will be forced to onshore much of its manufacturing, and we see a pivot from a service economy to a mix of service and manufacturing.\n\nOn the downside, I think that the private markets in the USA will dwindle and the Government will take more control of industry.  Government crackdowns in the US will be limited because the population are armed.  As I always tell people, if you want to go confiscate guns, have fun in Texas, Idaho, Wyoming, etc.  They make the Afghani guerillas look like boy scouts.",

Mostly beans, rice, frozen vegetables and some organic locally farmer chicken. \n\nAnd just as luck would have it, I met a lady, who works in healthcare, but we can\u2019t meet up. She\u2019s a midwife, and it seems that they\u2019re also super busy right now. (Not to complain; she really cares about her work. I respect that, a great deal. She cares.) \n\nAnyway, I have accumulated vacation days, still since 2018. So, I decided to take a 2 week vacation. Ended up reading and listening to too many things, as quarantines and lockdowns kicked in. \n\nNow I find myself exhausted; driven today, not after checking out survival kit. (Highly unusual for me.) And now I feel absolutely fatigued. I\u2019ve been tracking the markets, seeking to plot a course forward. Sleep has been bad of late. And with infection and deaths escalating; I feel quite cooked and done. I\u2019ve been volunteering as well. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s up with me. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nSorry to whine; I just feel quite knackered. And a pins and needles kind of (semi-painful) sensation across my shoulder blades. The first big waves of deaths should come crashing in this week. I think I have fatigue. Somehow, I\u2019m trying to reorient myself in the world. It feels like we\u2019re at a crossroad in history. It\u2019s a wild time to be alive. \n\nI\u2019m glad you have peace of mind; I thought I did. Now I have doubt if I do. Feels weird!",

The reason is to buy us time to ensure healthcare facilities aren't overrun like they are in every single country that has not shut down.\n\nIn the end, it's [simple math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs). If we as societies care about human lives, the lives of our parents, we have to ensure healthcare facilities can cope with the amount of sick people. If that requires us to shut down things for 3 weeks, so be it. If it's 3 months, we don't really have a choice imo. \n\nPumping liquidity into the market will hopefully allow markets to at least somewhat ride things out while we ensure healthcare facilities can cope.\n\nShutdowns will likely come in waves for 1-2yrs while we develop a cure. If we are lucky, we come up with a better treatment (not a cure) before then, and can lessen restrictions earlier already.\n\nAlso, it's easy for people to say \"people want to go back to work, even at the expense of lives\" while the virus isn't at your door step. Ask the people in NYC if they want to ignore the virus and go shopping again ;)",

In light of this, saying we can't just shut down and nature will weed out the weak is irresponsible even as the total death count in the US is increasing by 25-30% daily ie doubling every 2-3 days.",

    "postText": "As a person in their early 20's with basically limitless tolerance for short term volatility is it a viable strategy for 401k and IRA holdings to target for example VOOG for 5-10 years to capitalize on the increased gains then perform a nontaxable conversion of your holdings in VOOG into VOO then perhaps even later in life much closer to retiremwnt VOOV? Is this too much of an attempt at timing the market or is this a legitimate strategy?",

            "comment": "You're kind of misunderstanding \"value\" and \"growth.\" They're more descriptive terms about things like P/E and P/B ratios than descriptive terms about the returns you're likely to expect from holding them.\n\nIn the very long term, value stocks (specifically small value stocks) have tended to outperform growth stocks--it's one of the factors in so-called five factor investment models. However, over the last 10 years which is all you're really considering because that's when you've grown up, growth (specifically large cap growth) has spanked value.\n\nIs that likely to continue? Who the fuck knows. Unless you want to get really in the weeds trying to value different companies and/or look at how indexes define and select growth vs. value stocks, I'd say go for a total market fund (e.g. VTI) and spend your time doing stuff that is more important to you.\n\nFor reference:\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/072415/value-or-growth-stocks-which-best.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/072415/value-or-growth-stocks-which-best.asp)\n\n[https://youtu.be/2MVSsVi1\\_e4](https://youtu.be/2MVSsVi1_e4)",

You could switch to low vol and quality strategies.\n\nA bit misconception for example is that warren buffet is a value investor. He started that way, the Benjamin graham way, but his famous \"buy a great company at a reasonable price\" is quality. Value is buying \"a reasonable company at a great price\".",

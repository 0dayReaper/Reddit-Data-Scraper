    "postText": "I recently learned about the SLR strategy, which stands for Safety, Liquidity, and Returns. It emphasizes considering these factors when diversifying a portfolio. How can I effectively diversify my portfolio while incorporating the SLR philosophy? Any recommendations for low-risk investments to prioritize safety, strategies for maintaining liquidity, and opportunities for favorable returns?",

            "comment": "I think it refers to different investment instruments.\n\n* Safety means something that has lower return, but it's guaranteed. It's like term deposit or government bonds.\n* Liquidity means something that easy to cash out when you need it, but still have potential to grow. It's like foreign currency or money market mutual funds.\n* Return means something risky with high return. That includes current popular instruments like stocks, coins, options.\n\nI'm just guessing. The safety and liquidity should be easily accessible through banks. The last one is usually through trading platforms (robinhood, binance, etc.)",

            "comment": "I don't think that this is a very useful approach for retirement savings. Most tax advantaged retirement accounts aren't very liquid at all, for example. And if you are 20+ years away from retirement, \"safety\" shouldn't be much of a concern either, since there is usually an inverse relationship between safety and returns. \n\nWhen you are in the accumulating phase, returns matter more than anything, because the biggest danger you face is not accumulating enough for retirement in the first place. \n\nOnce you are in retirement, or close, the calculus changes. You won't have as much time to make up for losses, for one thing, and for another, you will likely need some of your nest egg for your expenses (which is the purpose of saving for retirement in the first place).",

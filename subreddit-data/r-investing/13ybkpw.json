Should someone who retired at 55 be counted as unemployed? Should a full time student who is 20 and taking 21 credits at a college and has no time to work be counted as unemployed? Probably not\n\nSo really only people who are unemployed , and want to be employed are counted.\n\nAlso there is what is sometimes referred to as a discouraged worker if someone has been unemployed for a long time and they sort of stop looking for work they now dropped off the unemployment list because they are not actively seeking employement\n\nSo now sometimes in a hot labor market , people who were once not working (spouse taking care of kids , discouraged workers , college students) sometimes now enter or re-enter the labor force looking for jobs.\n\nIts not uncommon especially after a recession when jobs start getting created again for the unemployment rate to tick up as people start to re-enter the labor force",

It increases demand for workers and raises wages. This is basic economics.\n\nIt is good. Even without knowing the full context of what exactly the jobs are.\n\nIf low unemployment isn't objectively good, I hope to see you around the next time we have high unemployment saying that high unemployment could actually be good assuming the jobs lost were low income ones.

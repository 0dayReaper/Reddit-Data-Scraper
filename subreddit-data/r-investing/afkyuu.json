Again, they don\u2019t have time for nuance. Plus with any visual medium the way something is portrayed visually tends to affect how the viewer will respond to the facts being presented. This can be used, intentionally or not, to influence people\u2019s opinion. ",

If they did stop buying, prices would plummet faster and at a deeper discount to NAV (whether 'true' or otherwise) than I think people are prepared for.",

All bonds typically trade on shallow markets so whats true for junk is true for high lien. As long as the bonds can be priced and transactions secured (i.e. liquidity), my guess would be that the ETF's could just be marked/balanced accordingly. The market value of bonds dwarfs equity markets. In the event of a liquidity event, ETF liquidity will likely be subordinate to the liquidity freeze of the majority of capital markets (i.e. bonds and other FI). That being said, I'd be curious to know what the market capitalization of ETF's: Bonds ratio is. ",

They just expected their investments/retirement accounts to just grow, that they can't lose. They expected their homes to be assets that will appreciate. I'm not absolving banks of their responsibility, but people are only finger pointing when their house of cards topple over. These very people are only mad because they weren't the ones bailed out.

The political economy of financial booms and busts remains both under-emphasized and limited to isolated episodes. This paper examines the political economy of financial policy during ten of the most infamous financial booms and busts since the 18th century, and presents consistent evidence of pro-cyclical regulatory policies by governments. Financial booms, and risk-taking during these episodes, were often amplified by* ***political regulatory stimuli, credit subsidies****, and an* ***increasing light-touch approach to financial supervision****. The regulatory backlash that ensues from financial crises can only be understood in the context of the deep political ramifications of these crises*.   \n\n\n***Post-crisis*** *regulations do not always survive the following boom. The interplay between politics and financial policy over these cycles deserves further attention. History suggests that politics can be the undoing of macro-prudential regulations.*  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "&gt; For me, I learned that socialism applies to the wealthy and capitalism for the average person.\n\nSocialism isn't really when \"government does things.\" See chapter 1, \"Isn't America already kind of socialist?,\" of *[The ABCs of Socialism](https://s3.jacobinmag.com/issues/jacobin-abcs.pdf)* (PDF warning). Socialism is when workers manage ... well, work. This means workers work together to run factories, tend fields, etc. Decisions are made collectively and democratically (directly, by the workers). This is \"social ownership,\" and it replaces capital, the individual ownership of otherwise common things in the world, of factories, the fields, etc. When the transition from capitalism to socialism occurs, it is called [socialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization_(Marxism\\)), a term that Marx came up with to describe when workers assumed control of their work from their bosses and owners (Marx).\n\nSocialization is not the same thing as Nationalization - which is where the government takes over something (e.g. makes a National Forest out of land). The USSR *nationalized* fields, factories, mines, etc. - transitioning ownership to a central bureaucracy rather than to the workers who worked in the fields and factories, etc. This, then, fails to be socialization, and generally fails to be \"socialism,\" as defined by figures like Marx (Bolloten). \n\n\nWith this said, I would probably re-phrase your statement from \"socialism applies to the wealthy, capitalism to the average person\" to something more like \"government is helping the wealthy, but not the average person.\" \n\nGovernment can be used for good - it can prevent monopolies, can protect the environment, can even redistribute resources to help the sick, poor, and marginalized. Keynes, the famous economist, argued we should use government to stabilize capitalism - for the social good. This notion is called many things: demand-side economics, modern liberalism, social liberalism, or simply \"liberalism.\" \n\nThis idea of government helping stabilize capitalism is seen as a progression of a previous ideology: \"classical\" liberalism. Locke, for example, argued for a minimal state apparatus to ensure the wealthy elite and their property would be protected from those without, and from foreign nations and powers. James Madison famously declared the purpose of the U.S. government is to protect the rich from the poor, and justifies the Senate in these terms. \n\nThis hands-off kind of capitalism, without government to prevent monopolies and abuses, is often said to have caused Great Depression. The causes of the Great Depression is controversial, but the direct reaction to the Great Depression was seen in Keynes work, and caused modern liberalism as we know it today.\n\nThere are still people arguing for a return to \"classical\" liberalism, and we may call these people various things as well: supply-side economists (like Milton Friedman, the second most famous American economist behind Keynes), classical liberals, free market fundamentalists, laissez-faire capitalists, etc. \n\nWhen the wealthy are helped out by the government, it is not *socialism* as much as a perversion of modern liberalism in the interests of the wealthy. And for the 99%? Well, you were right - we're living like we always have in America: under the thumb of the rich. All of this is capitalism.\n\n## Works Cited\n\n- Bolloten, Burnett. \"Chapter 22: Nationalization versus Socialization.\" *The Spanish Civil War*, University of North Carolina Press, 2015, pp. 225.\n- Maisano, Chris. \"Isn't America already kind of socialist?\" *ABCs of Socialism.* Verso, 2016. s3.jacobinmag.com/issues/jacobin-abcs.pdf.

                    "comment": "**Socialization (Marxism)**\n\nIn the theoretical works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and subsequent Marxist writers, socialization (or the socialization of production) is the process of transforming the act of producing and distributing goods and services from a solitary to a social relationship and collective endeavor. With the development of capitalism, production becomes centralized in firms and increasingly mechanized in contrast to the pre-capitalist modes of production where the act of production was a largely solitary act performed by individuals. Socialization occurs due to centralization of capital in industries where there are increasing returns to scale and a deepening of the division of labor and the specialization in skills necessary for increasingly complex forms of production and value creation. Progressive socialization of the forces of production under capitalism eventually comes into conflict with the persistence of relations of production based on private property; this contradiction between socialized production and private appropriation of the social product forms the impetus for the socialization of property relations (socialism).In Marx's critique of political economy, as capitalism develops a contradiction emerges between the increasingly socialized act of production and the private ownership and appropriation of surplus value.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/investing/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

    "postText": "I am looking to buy a new house but only using my savings would not be enough to put 20% down. I am wondering if it makes sense to liquidate a chunk of my brokerage account to put the down payment on the new house and once I get the equity out of the sale of my current house to reinvest \u2014 the equity will be much more than I\u2019ll take out.\n\nHate to take out stock that has had $44k gains over the life of the account but I am looking at it a little as a transfer of investments that I would be able to replenish about a month or 2 after the sale of my new home.\n\nThoughts?",

Far better to sell some stocks than dip into your 401k funds which is something that people are doing.\n\nOn the other hand, how long would it take you to save a comparable mount of money?  Would it make sense to wait a few months if that allowed you to not have to touch your stocks?",

You can always make more gains and reinvest, but having your own home is not only another great investment but a whole new feeling of freedom in itself. If you can afford everything without liquidating, you may reconsider, but I definitely think its worth it. Also consider after you've bought, you can always over-pay your mortgage to pay it off early, and use withdrawn funds that way as well.",

If you take $100k from your stocks, that's $100k less you have to borrow on a 6.5% mortgage, and you're saving $300-500 per month in mortgage insurance. With the interest and insurance avoided, you can roughly think of it as a guaranteed 10% yield on that $100k.",

In the first 2 years its like 75% interest, by my napkin math loan calculator it's around 500 a month. so if you were going to get cash back and pay off the loan in 10 months you going to be down around 5000$ on 50k portfolio you would need an 8-10% move just to be even.\n\nI mean if your portfolio goes up 18% it was better to float the loan for the period, if it stays flat, goes up 5, or goes down.. You would be better pulling the cash and coming back in.. \n\nI mean you need to look at the loan structure and calculate what's the better deal..\n\nBut if it's short term I mean.. Man even with loan closing costs you still need to do the math it may never work out.. I've had some loan deals I walked away from because when you add in all the closing it made no sense",

If and only if you plan on living in the new home for a long time. You can always roll investments into your mortgage, put the extra money towards the principal and not the interest. Not putting as much down is a controversial opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. It's what I did on my first home and glad I did.\n\nThe arguments for larger down payments are less spent on interest and fees, the downside is being cash poor and lack of financial flexibility. I think flexibility is so underappreciated because the future is uncertain and it's a lot cheaper to put more money into your house than it is to take it back out.",

The fact that you are converting your stock into a guaranteed 6+% return (by lowering your mortgage) helps skew this a bit.\n\nMy cautions are that you consider pretty strongly what happens if your current home sale goes much worse than you project, but that's regardless of how you pay to close on the new one.",

Personally, I would be extremely reluctant to liquidate my stocks if the market has just tanked since it feels like I've now cemented those losses forever. Of course, the state of the housing market and interest rates would also likely be affected so I suppose the benefits of buying a house at that time / a larger down payment could still outweigh the costs, but seems unlikely.\n\nTo me, this is exactly why investing in stocks is risky if you want to use that money to buy a house in the short term. If the market tanks, you've just lost a bunch of your downpayment and if you sell you aren't going to get it back.\n\nAll that said, the market is in a reasonable state right now so it doesn't seem like a terrible idea to sell (though of course it could still massively rally in the next six months which you'd miss out on of course but at least you wouldn't have lost money, just missed out on gains)",

            "comment": "As a loan officer you have a few different options. \n\n1. You can take out a 401k loan for up to 50k usually. They will factor the 401k loan payments against your qualifying income so it will affect your DTI. If you have good DTI ratios, this isn\u2019t a bad option. You can always pay the 401k loan back, typically they make you wait a year. Any interest you pay on the 401k loan usually goes back into your 401k. Nice way to pump it up too. You usually pay a small fee to take out the loan\n($75 or something close to that)\nGood option to avoid selling stocks and dealing with capital gains. \n\n2. Contact your investment account broker and see if they\u2019ll give you a margin loan or similar vehicle based on your assets. You can borrow against the value of your account at a decent rate. Sell the home and then pay off the loan. Typically it\u2019s set up as a line of credit and you can borrow against it and pay it back several times so long as the value of the account is more. If the value of your account drops the line will be called. (Similar to a margin call). \n\n3. If you have any carryover loss, you can sell stocks for a gain and offset the loss, without incurring capital gains. \n\n4. Get a \u201cgift\u201d from a family member. When your home sells, and if you\u2019re feeling generous, you can always make a gift to them. \n\n5. Take a larger loan (smaller down payment) with MI. Not sure how much the purchase price is or what 20% of that is. Ideally, you would put 10-15% down, then opt for something called single premium MI. This adds to you closing costs but typically a fraction of the difference you\u2019d have to put as down payment. You end up borrowing more so your monthly payment will increase as well. It\u2019s a good option for someone who\u2019s strapped for cash but doesn\u2019t have an issue with income. \n\n6. Put a smaller down payment, take a loan with MI, make a lump sum payment and have MI removed (typically you have to pay MI for 2 years before they can remove it if it\u2019s a conventional loan.) you can have your loan recast and have the payment schedule reamortization as well. Usually you pay a small fee to do this. \n\nThere are other options but these are more than enough  for you to come up with something. Are you in escrow on the new home? How long until you close? Timing may impact which decision is best as well.",

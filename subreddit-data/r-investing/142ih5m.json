At Ameritrade it was a big boost to have them trying to fill your order to the best price. \n2) at Robinhood it\u2019s easier to jump on a trade but at Ameritrade it has a true multilevel indicator and strategies. It feels at times like a huge Universe of information and educational resources. \n\nEnd. Good luck.",

            "comment": "I see no real compelling reason to use robinhood vs another brokerage the biggest draw backs IMHO are\n\n1. They only offer stocks/options/ETFs , with other brokerages you can invest in mutual funds , money market mutual funds, bonds . For more advanced investors you can also get access to futures markets \n2. Lack of support. With a normal brokerage account you can call the brokerage customer service for issues or questions , many also have live chats. Robinhood has zero customer service . I think technically through the \"app\" you can request a call back but who knows how long it will take\n3. They gamify trading and do things to make you trade more often. Trading often is usually detrimental to your gains . They will use push notifications and flashy animations to try to get you to place trades \n4. They have had several high profile screw ups, mis managing their margin , mis managing users margin , technical glitches that cause them to display wrong amounts . Now all brokerages will have some glitches but RH seems to have more than most. At most other brokerages if you need to place a trade when the website is down you can call and have them place a trade for you, they will usually waive the fee if the website is down. Since RH has no customer service this is not an option\n\nNow there are a whole lot of conspiracy theories about when they had halted trading during the meme stock craze and lots of user would tell you they stopped trading to protect \"hedge funds\" and this is really a half truth or quarter truth\n\nThey did stop trading but it was do to issue #4, they mis-managed their margin so badly they ran out of money . Millions of new users signed up and they fronted them money . Or existing users initiated transfers and again they fronted them money until their deposit cleared. They all went out to buy meme stocks and realized they were running out of money , they fronted users so much money they were in danger of running out and not being able to have money to clear the trades. So during this time they restricted buying of the meme stocks that their users were trying to buy\n\nI am not defending RH here, its still a colossal fuck up to mis manage your margin so bad you have to restrict your own users from buying, but it was do to massive incompetence rather then some conspiracy theory about them trying to help hedge funds or market makers or something.",

                    "comment": "Why people seems to be parroting the wrong information. As far as I remember many brokerages also restrict trading and while the problem was in the margin it was not totally in robinhood fault, my take at the time was that the clearing house was the one in the fault because they raise the margin requirement and clearly something wrong happen in the back maybe it was true that the short squeeze was unexpectedly reaching too high too fast that they need to shut the buying power and robinhood who maybe was the most popular millennial brokerage at that time would be giving a lot of impact on the market when they restrict buying and so they became the black sheep. If I'm not wrong similar thing also happen with LME and they need to cancel the trades which more outrageous but the news not really widespread because maybe the retails not involved.\n\nMy opinion is market isn't free so don't play too much fire. They would only let you win so much that negligible to their profit. If they took a lost because stupidity or some circumstances then they might just flip the table.",

They did restrict buying on MARGIN what is normal for a highly volatile stock or security \n\nThey basically did not want someone to buy $2k with cleared funds and another 1.5K on margin only to have it drop quickly with them holding the bag unable to margin call .\n\nYour opinion is your opinion , I have been investing since 2008 and I have made plenty of profit as a retail investor , I don't chase meme stocks or penny stocks however",

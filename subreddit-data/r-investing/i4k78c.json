Their \u201cquarterly report\u201d might as well have been a fat middle finger to both their investors and the SEC.\n\nOh btw the company is worth around $15B... and some analysts are saying it\u2019s a \u201cbuying opportunity\u201d given today\u2019s dip.\n\n**Edit**: for more context on the Pets.com comparison:\n\nPets.com had annual revenue of $619k for first year, and reached a market cap of $400M at its highest. Crazy bubble right?\n\nWell Nikola has annual revenue of less than $100k (maybe a bit more depends on how many more solar panels the CEO is gonna order for his houses lmao), but reached market cap of $30B at its highest.\n\nIt\u2019s literally 500 times more overvalued than the most infamous bubble stock during the dotcom crisis.\n\n**Edit 2**: For the people who argue how revenue doesn't matter because they are the next Tesla.\n\nFor comparison. Tesla was founded in 2003 and 5 years later the original Tesla Roadster was on sale. They didn't go IPO until 2 years after that. Elon Musk also had a decent track record, being a co-founder and CEO of this small startup called PayPal.\n\nMeanwhile Nikola Motors was founded in 2004, by a businessman with no real education whose resume is \"fluffy\" at best, and their six years of \"industry leading product development\" has yielded some fantastic CG renderings. \n\nCan Nikola be the next Tesla? Never say never, especially in the year 2020. But my bet is that Trevor Milton is closer to Elizabeth Holmes than Elon Musk.\n\n**Edit 3** Ahahahaha apparently Trevor gave out more update of their factory construction (remember production is supposed to start in 2021) at yesterday's quarterly call...and drum roll...... [it's more CG rendering!!!](https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1290756638815612928).",

I was referring to \"[warrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(finance))\", not \"options\". Here in Germany most people don't do the \"real\" options stuff, instead they buy/sell warrants, which are issued by a bank (in this case JP Morgan), and then these warrants are traded freely on an exchange.\n4.

Crucial components, for example the fuel cell itself, were missing. [Source](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/nikola-trevor-milton-prototype-non-functional/).\n* His interviews are full of bullshit. For example for a long time he kept saying that Nikola is vertically integrated (which would be rather difficult but very good for margins of course) but then suddenly it was the exact opposite and the winning strategy now was to outsource everything, including production (to Iveco) and sales and maintenance (to Ryder). And when Ryder jumped off that deal (probably they smelled it's fishy) he was tweeting it like that's a good thing like \"oh, now we no longer have to be exclusive with them\". (All found in [this video](https://youtu.be/mdH5VKU6aZU?t=700))\n* The \"Badger\" pickup is supposed to come in 2 variants, either all-electric or hydrogen. From a technical point of view this does not make much sense, since the hydrogen components (tanks, fuel cell) don't have a similar form factor as the battery. It only makes sense if you've never put much technical thought in it. Of course it **can** be done technically, but then you don't end up with 2 excellent products - you'll end up with 2 very mediocre products.",

Fuel cells don't have the \"throttle response\" needed to run a car, so they use a battery as a buffer. Granted, it's a pretty small battery-similar in size to most hybrids. But then that's really what an FCEV is-a hybrid that has replaced the ICE with a fuel cell.\n\nAlso, there's already a car that's available like this: the Honda Clarity. It's available as a BEV, PHEV, and a FCEV. However, I'll grant you that this modularity of design does make each version mediocre.\n\nThe Badger though, is supposed to be a FCEV with a much larger battery. 300 miles of battery range is comparable to most high-end BEVs on the market right now, and comparable with most planned BEV trucks that have been revealed.\n\nSimply taking out the fuel cell hardware and tanks should be pretty trivial. That being said, H2 tanks take up a LOT of space, so if they don't fill that space with more battery, they'll have a truck with a lot of wasted space.",

On top of IPOing what I would assume to be one of the most important moments in his life he decides to remove himself as CEO and just be chairman. To me that signals that he is already starting to distance himself from this so when it blows up he can blame the current guy and not be held responsible.",

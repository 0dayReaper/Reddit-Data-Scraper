I have several thousand dollars worth of old American tools still NIB that I've been slowly selling to people at or near cost at a charity class I teach to help low income individuals learn to fix their own cars and appliances. To get better than that, you really have to go up to SK or Snap On, for prices that are prohibitive even to \"prosumers.\" \n\nWhat really bakes my biscuit is that my Dad still has my grandfather's Circle-U tools that he got when he got out of the army and went to work as a mechanic at a dealership on big rigs, which he did for his whole career. Even working on rigs, those tools almost never broke. They feel like they were forged out of the heart of a dying star; you hold a Snap-On breaker bar and one of those breakers in your hand at the same time, the Circle U feels like two pounds heavier even though they're about the same dimensions. We've even used the circle-U sockets on a 1/2 impact gun when we were feeling lazy. Zero problems.\n\nI want those tools so bad, but dad loves to wrench too, and I'd obviously rather have my dad around than the inheritance, so I'll settle for \"long term borrowing.\" All Sears had to do was just keep that up. Your warranty doesn't cost you anything if your stuff doesn't break.  ",

They are Chief Financial Officer Robert Riecker, Chief Digital Officer Leena Munjal and Gregory Ladley, president of the company's clothing and footwear business.\n\nIt's a tough thing. I do see the argument that you need good executives to protect the bankrupt estate, but when you see stuff like this in the same article:\n\n&gt; Shelia Brewer, who worked for 17 years as a full-time hourly employee at a Kmart in Rockford Illinois, said the company told her she'd get eight weeks of severance. Instead, she received a letter saying that severance payments were being halted because of the bankruptcy, and she would get only the four weeks of pay she had already received.\n\nIt sure seems unjust, or at least unfair.",

If I'm a major shareholder, I'd think I could do better if I triple my company's value over 12 years instead of just gut it to bankruptcy. It says lamperts estimated net worth was like 3.8 billion is 2006. And it slowly went down until today it's at like 1 billion. He bought up a big percent of AutoZone and turned that around and 20x his investments. He bought up a ton of Kmart debt before bankruptcy and then tuned the company around as well. So he has a history of not gutting companies. He then merged Kmart and Sears and it was a cluster. I just don't see how it was his plan to gut Sears. I think he just got in over his head on a shit company and kept trying to give it lifelines. I think the reason he's the owner of a lot of Sears assets is that they're garbage and nobody wants them. As far as I can tell, lampert lost tons of money with Sears. ",

SYW probably wasn't soley what caused Sears demise, I'm sure.\n\nIt was a series of events, but just based on timing, I think SYW was the final blow.  It was bad timing. Extreme couponing was just blowing up.  People found out quickly how flawed this program was and took advantage of it.  \n\nThey bled money.  I'm not an expert, but that can't be good for business.",

I have invested in various mutual funds over the years, but recently I have been comparing them all to the S&amp;P 500 on various time scales and none ever outperform it (on any timescale 1, 3, 5, 10 years). Is there any reason to not just transfer all of my mutual funds to FXAIX the S&amp;P 500 index fund?  It seems like it will always make more. If you don't think that's the right call, could you provide some evidence for your reason? For reference I am on the younger side so I can afford some risk in my portfolio. Thanks!",

They were doing really well at the start, but since the pandemic, they dropped and haven\u2019t been in the green since. I haven\u2019t contributed to them at all since they stagnated when the rest of my accounts started growing again. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how these funds work and the stock market is not my thing. The loss isn\u2019t a huge dent in my finances, so I\u2019m reluctant to move it if it could potentially turn around in the future. At the same time it would be even better if I could get that money to start earning again. What would you do- keep it or move it?",

Some sectors im not familiar with and I see these traders who make sensible trades with good write ups that have an excellent track record. Wisdom of crowds is very valuable and actually one of the best ways to forecast the future. Moreover Im not in with a lot but when I see a convincing play in their portfolio I may increase weight myself by adding separately on that play. So far this has paid of pretty well and I reevaluate on a yearly basis and add more to the successful traders or remove from the ones clearly failing.\n\nAlso an important note in contrast to the other comment. ETFs aren\u2019t actively being changed other than balancing out so the owner of the ETF has done it\u2019s job once it\u2019s launched and money flows in. It doesn\u2019t care much about its performance later on while copy trader can make it that you follow someone smarter or wiser in a certain sector (something difficult to admit for many traders). A nice way to diversify if you ask me.",

Then you'll find out that this meal is way too heavy on cheese, or way too light on bread, but that was not your intention.\n\nBetter off just buying one complete meal (VTI/VXUS) in whatever quantity, and *then* adding on the tilts. But minimally. Adding more ETFs is not diversifying. It's cluttering. Right now I see tilts to growth, to value, to large cap, to small cap, to small cap value, to large cap value, .... In the net it's very unclear what your actual tilts are. If you tilt small caps then tilt large caps, then what is really happening?\n\nWhat I'd do (since you don't have much invested the tax implications are minimal). Put everything into VT (or VTI/VXUS), then pick 2-4 ETFs (max) with tilts you have conviction in (say small cap value). And whatever individual stocks if you really want. If you're going to deviate from the global stock market, you should be able to transparently assess how you are deviating. For example, I take heavy tilts to certain commodities and small cap value. I don't then go and add a bunch of large cap funds, tech ETFs, healthcare ETFs, ... That's already there in VTI/VXUS.",

I had a few questions about allocating my assets going forward that I was hoping the group could help with.\n\n**Background:** \n\n* I'm currently 38 years old, married, with two kids. My wife and I both have steady jobs.\n* I started investing using a three-fund portfolio running on Vanguard's VBTLX, VTSAX, and VTIAX.\n* Up until 2021, I think I was over-allocated to bonds (\\~30% with some guidance that I read online). I think this really watered down my returns over the first 5 years of investing. I have since updated this to 10.5% bonds.\n* I currently have around a 65/35 split of money in non-retirement investments and cash (using Betterment's Cash Reserve account)\n* We have no immediate plans for large purchases, so any money I invest could hypothetically stay there for some time, at least 3-5 years.\n* Total non-retirement finances are around $1.3M.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Should I be putting more of my money into investments? I was thinking of increasing to an 80/20 split instead of 65/35. Should I push even higher than this?\n* I'm currently running on 10.5% bonds, 53.5% stocks, and 36% international stocks. Does this seem like a reasonable allocation for my age (38)?\n* I've generally avoided going to financial advisors after meeting with one and learning that they wanted 1% of my total assets under management. I realize that with the type of savings that I'm talking here that I could benefit from something like this, however, so any recommendations on how to approach this would be appreciated (even if it's a one-time consultation).",

Reddit did build an official phone app but most agree it kind of sucks\n\nAnd that is the issue, I use RIF sometimes on my phone, I never see ads . I can see why there is a problem , like all free sites reddit tries to drive traffic then sell ads . If everyone is using 3rd party apps that do not display adds reddit losses out on advertising\n\nNow can they pipe ads through the API ? Maybe .\n\nHowever I think the issue is this, people are saying \"well if I cannot use RIF I will just stop using reddit\" well that threat kind of falls flat , you are not making reddit any money to begin with so reddit bottom line is not really affected if you stop using reddit",

You should also have reduced the money to under $7K.\n\nIf you're looking to earn more than that, you'd have to make riskier investments.",

I'm not opposed to higher risk, but I don't know much about investing tbh. And I know 10k isn't a lot to weigh on. My in law told me it Kah be smart to do 6 month cd and year long cd. Split the cash. Keep flipping the cd into longer ones when they mature if I don't need to money. 5 years was just a random number. Could come up sooner or later. Liquid is key,  but also some level of gain. Hysv might be a good olay because I can keep adding to it as well. Although the idea of working the money a bit to gain more ans use if with some risk is definitely an option.",

Over 5 years it's definitely likely it'll go up but not guaranteed and it indeed can go down. For example if you had put your $10,000 into an S&amp;P ETF back in Dec 2021 it would now be worth a whopping $9162. Because if this generally people wouldn't put money that they are saving for a planned purchase into an index fund. They're better as a retirement vehicle because you have time on your side.\n\nTreasuries or CDs are probably the way to go. They will tie your money up for some time, but you can do something like 4 month treasuries that reinvest and keep that going as long as the rates are in your favor. You'll make a little more than a HYSA. Not a shocking amount. Probably something like $600 more over 5 years.\n\nIt's not always worth it to worry about 1% or less on smaller investment amounts. 1% is definitely a notable difference if you're talking about a million $ where you're looking at a 10k difference a year where as for $10K it's a $100 a year difference.",

It seems there is confidence that any additional rate hikes would be fairly limited, any more aggression from the federal reserve would lower the chances of a soft landing in the future.

Some brokers will have call protection as part of their search and screening functions. \n\nYou could also look at other fixed income investments like treasuries and investment grade bond funds if you want to lock in rates. Depends on your risk tolerance for fixed income products.",

They outline to diversify in 3 categories. Bonds/low beta stocks/ small value stocks. The part I'm confused on are the bond stocks they are saying I should invest in. Here are the tickers ( IEI, TIP, BWX.)\nAll of these stocks look as if they're plummeting. If I'm in it for long term investing am I just looking at the wrong stats when it comes to bonds. The stocks inside the low beta and small/value stocks all look great. It's just the bonds. Thanks!",

You can't really just look at the fund price trend. \n\nTake IEI for example - It's a 3-7 year treasury bond fund - [https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/239455/ishares-37-year-treasury-bond-etf](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/239455/ishares-37-year-treasury-bond-etf) \n\nThe average yield to maturity is 4.02%. And the Effective Duration is about 4.43 years. \n\nThat means that if you buy shares of IEI now and you reinvest the dividends, you should expect to have about a 4% annual yield in about 4-5 years. \n\nThis type of fund is generally considered much lower risk because it's underlying is treasuries.",

So that means that worst case is that you don't receive the annualized average yield to maturity for at least 3-5 years.\n\nThat's why you want to look at weighted average maturity and effective duration. That's about the number of years where you have to hold the fund before you can expect to get the average yield to maturity of about 4%.\n\nSo the reason why you see the 1 and 3 year returns is because interest rates have been going up.\n\nLook at the  5 year and 10 year averages, the Federal Funds effective rate in the past 10 years have been less than 1% so - the yields are what you would expect - [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS)\n\nBecause of higher than desired inflation, the Fed has been steadily raising rates to help curb inflation. \n\nSo if you have a horizon of 5 to 10 years and you want a low risk investment - IEI is a reasonable choice.",

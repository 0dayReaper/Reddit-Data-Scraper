Which is kind of a bummer for their Treasury/Government MMMF, which is supposed to have 99.5% of assets in Treasurys.  Do the math.\n\nEdit: it also made me think: if conservative bond purchasers are doing the same, does that mean there's been a huge contraction in demand for bonds maturing in the window? Meaning that government auctions for such bonds have been raising less money? Meaning that even if they government doesn't default, they've already suffered a loss relative to the counterfactual by having this scare?",

For as long as they are in default then short term credit and transfers would probably be locked up as almost every bank in the US would be illiquid. There would be risk of runs and insolvency if withdraws or transfers were allowed.",

Your money is being invested in all sorts of things, likely bonds, repos, depends really what MMF you have. In any case, although it's only happened twice, there is a potential chance for your MMF to \"break the buck\" as they say, in the event of an economic collapse or a banking crisis. Personally, at 4.6% annual, im getting .34% a month, which comes down to an insignificant amount per day. I am willing to forgo a weeks worth of that accumulated interest in my MMF in order to not have my capital contained in a vessel that could (although unlikely) have negative consequences. At the end of the day, you are likely fine, this is all oversight.",

    "postText": "I've been conducting some recent analysis, and I thought I'd share some interesting graphs with all of you.\n\nThe graph below illustrates the drawdown from previous highs. It demonstrates that, apart from the 1929 crash, all other drops have experienced drawdowns ranging from 40% to 55% for over a century.\n\nAdditionally, the time frame between the graph reaching zero and then declining back to zero represents the duration it took to recover from each fall. This is why you can observe a significant \"window\" from 1929 until around 1955 (approximately), as it took more than 20 years to recover from that particular crash.\n\n([https://postimg.cc/s1KFmD3t](https://postimg.cc/s1KFmD3t))\n\nCODE:\n\n    close_prices = etf['Close']\n    cum_max_prices = close_prices.cummax()\n    drawdown = (cum_max_prices - close_prices) / cum_max_prices * 100\n    \n    plt.plot(drawdown)\n    \n\nData: \"snp500\" estimation by [stooq](https://stooq.com/q/d/l/?s=^spx&amp;i=d)",

The blue line is the number of inches/cm below the absolute highest (previous) water level that the ocean is currently at.\n\nThis is why it never goes below zero. When it hits a new record, it is exactly 0 inches below the peak.\n\nWhen the blue line is high, their is a low tide (or stocks have fallen a lot from their peak)",

The Great Depression involved a deflationary spiral, so if it isn't it might overemphasize it (still definitely not a fun time, regardless). \n\nAnyway, cool stuff, and a useful reminder that 40%+ drawdowns are not that uncommon and that one should definitely be prepared for such an eventuality.\n\n**EDIT:** Also, what about dividends? Is this total return, or does it only look at prices?",

I sold half of my shares, and am deciding if I should continue to sell before the vote comes to fruition.\n\nInsight from all perspectives is appreciated.",

If you had 3 shares, 2 would convert to the new share and the final one would sell.\n\nI've seen it happen, not super often, where it'll round. I've been in a couple 1-for-4 or 1-for-5 splits that gave you the new share as long as you had one of the previous ones. Not common, and you maybe make like 60 cents lol",

After the reverse split the priced dropped further and I had fewer shares.  Just today, I took at $4300 loss after deciding the stock is dead money.  I\u2019ve made enough gains to offset the loss and will do the tax harvesting to reduce my taxable income if necessary.",

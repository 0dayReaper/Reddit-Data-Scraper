All you would need is a prime membership and you would have free wireless. \n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/m/fb894bde-96fe-3e84-81c0-f641bbfd3c86/amazon-s-next-major-move-may.html",

            "comment": "The numbers seem pretty horrific to resell wholesale wireless. Charter and Comcast offload more than 80% of data onto their own networks, charge $30/month per line, and it doesn\u2019t seem profitable yet. I can\u2019t even imagine if Amazon tried to use 100% wholesale. Economically seems horrific.\n\nIn my opinion, the probable best path forward is for amazon to buy a company like Dish for $25 billion since dish is close to finishing up their network. Wipe away all that debt/ replace with cheaper Amazon debt, then you can offer wireless for $15 a month probably and break even. May have to still be $30.\n\nOr even better, just wait for their kuiper network. Maybe itll be cost effective then.\n\nThe real value of the wireless network is the actual fiber infrastructure that took decades to lay down. It cost so many billions. There\u2019s no way you can just give away that service for free in any economical fashion. Either debt or equity was used to lay down those wires, and both demand some return.",

They don't sell their spying devices because they're making huge margins on an Echo.",

Yeah, you're right though that it would probably be a nightmare for amazon. I think the key is getting more amazon prime members and hoping that in maybe 5 years, they break even",

I think this is absolutely easily attainable if you're aware of the us government \"lifeline\" services which almost all carriers offer a free smartphone and monthly service which also includes a limited amount of data for use as a mobile hotspot, to anyone who qualifies as low income, disabled, unemployed, those who receive govt benefits for food/healthcare/housing etc. since the government credits carriers for each customer they provide such services for, it seems very likely they would take advantage of that available credit and offered it as a free basic service for prime members with im sure available up sell plan addons. Pretty sure long term option calls are solid investment options in this company they are never going to stop moonshoting",

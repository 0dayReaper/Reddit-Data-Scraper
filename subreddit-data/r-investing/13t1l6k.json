I knew they made good products, and I had conviction that CPU and GPU hardware would become ever more important in the future. That allowed me to hold through down periods and reap the rewards.\n\nLuck matters as well.",

Southwest airlines was a 100 bagger, and airlines are a terrible industry. Couple ideas. First, IPOs absolutely suck as a group but some do OK from the jump. They tend to be owner operators and at least a little profitable from the beginning. Look for high insider ownership AFTER the lockup period. Owner operators are rare but as a group tend to be the source of big winners.. The sweet spot for young companies is 3-5 years after IPO. They should prove their business model by then. Ignore the companies burning cash, some survive, 99% don't.\n\n Look for high revenue growth, positive ROIC and a high reinvestment rate back into the business. Earnings may be suppressed due to the reinvestment rate. Look for increase in invested capital year over year. Ignore companies with excessive stock based compensation, the expense is real. \n\nLastly, read the investor presentation. Determine what their niche is. What makes their business different than their competitors? Will they be able to earn higher returns than their peers? Is management capable and trustworthy, or are they just self promotional?\n\nIt's a lot of work, but It can be fun. Also don't forget to buy the index in your retirement account.",

For example, here are 10 stocks I think have the potential to increase 10 fold:\n\n1. CLNE. This company produces and sells renewable natural gas (has captured from dairy manure and landfills). They've been around for 25 years, starting with fossil fuel natural gas, and there stock is down about 70% over the past 10 years... but: they've attracted major investors (the French oil company Total, Amazon and BP), they have more than 500 fueling stations and Cummins will be selling a new NG engine next year that will power long haul trucks which purchase $40 billion of fuel each year.\n2. SLDP. This is an American company is working on building Solid State Batteries for cars. Their investors include Ford Motor and BMW. \n3. MELI. This is a huge Brazilian company serving all of Latin and Central America that is a combination of Amazon and PayPal.\n4. NVCR. Company that has had great success with a new cure for cancers.\n5. CRSP. Company that uses gene splice editing to cure diseases like Sickle Cell Anemia.\n6. AXON. Company that started with tasers but has expanded to sell a wide range of products to help law enforcement.\n7. CRWD. Cyber security uses AI and crowd sourcing to quickly identify new threats and spread inoculations to their rapidly growing client base.\n8. DOCN. A cheaper alternative to expensive cloud services like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's OneDrive.\n9. ADYEY. Dutch company that has a rapidly growing software linking small and mid-size retailers and other businesses to financial systems.\n10.  TER.

There are two reasons I think CRSP is a better investment than most big pharmaceutical companies.\n\nFirst, CRSP is on the cusp of regulatory approval for the cure of diseases that inflict 32,000 in the U.S. and let's say for argument purposes another 18,000 in Europe (giving us a nice round 50,000 total). While that is a relatively small number of people, it is a compelling and unique treatment that CRSP offers for awful diseases that people desperately want treatment for. How much would they charge for this? Let's say $20,000 (it will probably be much more than this, especially initially). That's $1 billion in revenue. Which is very big for a company now valued at $5 billion. And, remember, this is one product; they've others in the works.\n\nSecond, while big pharmas are also using CRISPR technology, these companies are already worth $20 to $50 billion. So, if one of them develops a CRISPR cure worth a billion, it won't have nearly the impact on their share price.\n\nTLDR: CRSP could grow into a big pharma, which implies a 5x to 10x return on their stock. A similar product introduced by a big pharma might return 10-20%.",

I don't trade -- I look very carefully before investing and then hold for many years. The one thing I look for is the ratio of addressable market to market capitalization. For example, there's a $40 billion market selling fuel to long-haul trucks. CLNE's market cap is $0.9 billion. The market for Solid State Batteries that SLDP is developing is hard to quantify, but there are 3 million cars sold each year in the United States, electric vehicles are likely to become a substantial portion of that, SSB are also useful in other industries, so it seems like the addressable market is in the tens of billions; SLDP' market cap is $0.38 billion. It's more complicated than this, obviously, but the point is I don't try to jump in and out, and I don't panic when day-to-day or even month-to-month trends go negative.

I've greatly increased my position over the past six months. It's going down because it's value won't be proven until several years from now and, with rising interest rates, the time value of holding has caused all equities valued based on future projections to fall. If interest rates continue to rise, the impact on speculative investments will continue to be negative. Personally, I can wait so I am happy to be able to increase my position while prices are low; and I don't know what interest rates will be in the coming years.

I dont want it to be fun or exciting, i want it to be boring. Otherwise ill be tempted to gamble and do stupid shit.  I leave the stupid shit and stock picking to others.

I bought early 2019 because I liked their autonomous driving capabilities. In the end they mooned because of data centers and AI.

It comes down to regulations requiring you to be rich AF so you are deemed to be \u201csophisticated.\u201d That creates a gating mechanism where only rich AF people get access. That is then combined with founders and early employees not necessarily wanting to dilute their equity by selling it to too many people at extremely low valuations before going public. This makes it so only a small handful of investors get access and usually they are close friends, players in the particularly industry, or more commonly VC firms. VC firms often have their own clients, but they are all rich AF too and are required to commit levels of capital most of us could only dream of having. Basically, the system helps the rich get richer and keeps us all eating the scraps. This is done largely in the name of protecting ordinary investors. You can debate whether that\u2019s fair.",

Sometimes there's literal insider information and occasionally you'll hear about pharma drugs that may get approved. This is great money and honestly not all that risky if you do enough research. Invest in companies facing FDA approval about 3 days before their approval and you easily see cool 100%+ gains. I'm sitting at 212% gains on TGTX my most recent pharma find. You can pretty easily stock pick for huge gains, and I'm tired of all these ancient motherfuckers on here saying you can't. Call me when my VT investment goes up 212% in one quarter lol.

Renewables were on the horizon and EVs seemed a logical step...and Tesla was the only company that was going at it full tilt.\n\nSince I was I kid I thought that ICE cars were wasteful and EVs are just so efficient that this seemed to be an inevitable progression. When I finally got mine in early 2019 I was just blown away how good it was and immediately sunk some money into the company. \n\n (Of course this investment could have gone horribly wrong...so this isn't some 'genius move' or something. There was a fair amount of luck involved that the company didn't fold around that time) \n\nLong story short: Go to what you know and think ahead.",

And I've continued to hold it since then due to their continuing conviction that it is a good stock to buy and hold. I have trimmed some profit off over the years to add some comfort, knowing that if it does fall I have realized some of the gains. When I read their recommendation in 2012 the investment thesis they laid out just really resonated with me and made sense.\n\nThey also recommended buying NVDA way back then (in 2005, 2009, and 2017), but I didn't jump on that train until recently, in December 2020. Even so, my shares have tripled in that relatively short time.\n\nOf course, not every pick is going to be a winner. But you only need to pick a winner 60% of the time to beat the S&amp;P 500. And only a handful of picks (maybe 5%) will be the next TSLA or NVDA that goes to the moon and represents all the gains from investing. This is even how it works in the indexes. The trick to beating the S&amp;P 500 is to invest in more of the 25 winners, while investing in the fewer of the 475 losers, compared to the S&amp;P 500. Being a Motley Fool Stock Advisor subscriber has helped me do that.",

You hear all the stories about the people who make this incredible early investments and make tons of money, but there are far more that do the same kind of investments and loose out. Hell, look at some of the extra big players today. ARK Invest and SoftBank are two that come to mind. They made huge returns (and gained game) on big, successful early bets on innovative companies, only to squander those gains and loose huge amounts of money on their failed subsequent investments.\n\nSo yeah, this road is a LOT harder than it may sound, and is far from a sure thing.",

            "comment": "I believe I've found a few of these companies that you're asking about but when people try to share information about them in places like reddit, they're often ignored, downvoted and this subreddit in particular is particularly awful about it.  \n\n\nI've found all these opportunities through word of mouth.  \nThe way it works is that you talk to other investors and build up your network.  \nYou talk to your network, you tell them about your investments and what your risk/reward is, you share your DD and they do the same.  \nIf you find that they have better/more intriguing companies you join that community and what ends up happening is this.  \nYou genuinely find out what your risk tolerance is, especially when you have high conviction holds which you get from doing your own DD.  \nYou meet a lot of other investors who all have done their own due diligence and have other picks which might be of more interest to you.  \nYou become an expert with the stock you're invested in, you know all the risks, all the upcoming milestones and what this means is that you know when to sell if the company isn't working out and you know when to hold in down periods when the market is being irrational.  \n\n\nSo what does this look like in practice?  \nI joined a space stocks server, there were some cool companies but this random dude had hyper conviction in a particular satellite company.  \nHe tells me the risk/reward for that company, I cant believe it so I start reading everything I can about the company, I read the SEC filings, I read the prospectus, I read other peoples DD etc, make my own valuation model and then I buy in.  \nI meet other investors in the same stock, get invited to other communities with holders and they tell me about other stocks they're looking at. I think those other stocks are cool and are less risky but have less reward, the risk/reward ratio is still really similar so I keep an eye on them.  \n\n\nNow this is the really important part.  \n\n\nYou complain and whine about how the companies stock price is falling even though when you invested they hadn't launched their prototype and now their prototype can handle cellphone calls from anywhere in the fucking world. Doesn't matter because the market is irrational, ugh.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou might be thinking, thats great and all but how did those people who you met find out about that early investment opportunity?  \nWell I have the answer you're looking for, they were degenerate SPAC gamblers and after the SPAC bubble burst, many gave up but a solid chunk ended up investing in companies that actually made sense.  \n\n\nOne thing to remember about these 'early investment opportunities' is that they aren't without risk. They're still stupidly risky and they take time to execute.  \nI'll still take my risky pre-revenue startup company that I know like the back of my hand over minimal research on a blue-chip stock.",

            "comment": "I'm not making any recommendations or suggesting this is a good idea. But I will just answer your question as to what I would do if someone gave me this task.\n\nSo if you want to \"find early opportunities\", and be ready to miss a lot of the time, is just go to a stock screener and look for companies that are mid-cap, or if you dare small-cap\n\nFilter biotech, financials then tech stocks as have the highest upside volatility in that order\n\nSort for stocks that are going up recently fast\n\nRandomly pick stocks off that list, or just put $10 in all of them.\n\nWait a year, two years etc. and chances are one of them will have more than 1000% return, from 200m to 2bn or 2bn to 20bn\n\nYou can look at the best performing stocks YTD this year, and you'll see a bunch of biotechs, financial and tech stocks\n\nRepeat - NOT saying this is a good idea. It's only what I would do if someone wanted me to find a stock that rallies 1000%+",

And generally when you actually find a product you're really excited about and think may be revolutionary, it's a non public company.",

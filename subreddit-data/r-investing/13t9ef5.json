    "postText": "My wife and I are maxing out our 401ks, and it looks like my wife is being offered to join her company 403b on top of her 401k. To me this sounds like further reducing our tax bill, but I'm wondering if there are any subtleties that I might be missing.\n\nMy wife works for a non-profit, and the language of the offer made it sound like only tenured, senior people are offered this. But I also know it's what teachers tend to get and they aren't that popular.\n\nEdit: Sorry it's actually a 457b.",

There's also an overall limit I think, but it's higher than the maximum individual contribution limits for those two plan types. I want to say that bigger limit includes employer match as well or something.",

My wife has similar compensation.\n\nThe 457 plan is a retirement savings plan and you generally cannot withdraw money while you are still employed. When you leave employment, you may withdraw funds; leave them in place; transfer them to a 457, 403(b) or 401(k) of a new employer; or roll them into an Individual Reti",

    "postText": "Per CNBC - After years of [Sears Holdings](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SHLD) staying afloat through financial maneuvering and relying on billions of CEO Eddie Lampert's own money, the 125-year-old retailer filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThe filing comes more than a decade after Lampert merged Sears and Kmart, hoping that forging together the two struggling discounters would create a more formidable competitor.\n\nIt comes after Lampert [shed assets and spun out real estate](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/18/eddie-lampert-says-sears-is-shrinking-shedding-assets-to-stay-alive.html), all to pay down the debt the retailer accumulated when that plan went askew. The company still has roughly 700 stores, which have at times been barren, unstocked by vendors who have lost their trust. Many of the stores have never been visited by a generation of shoppers that can barely recall it was once the the country's biggest retailer.\n\nLampert, who has a controlling ownership stake in Sears, personally holds some 31 percent of the retailer's shares outstanding, according to FactSet. His hedge fund ESL Investments owns about 19 percent.\n\nUltimately, it was a $134 million payment that did the company in. The company had a payment due Monday it had not the money to pay.\n\nOther forces were at play too. Sears' creditors refused to agree to a [restructuring proposal](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/sears-ceo-proposes-restructuring-plan-to-avoid-bankruptcy.html). They had little assurance by way of collateral or strategy, after years upon years in which Sears' only shot at survival came by selling off parts of its business. Over 42 quarters, only one yielded positive same-store sales growth. As of late September, Sears tallied $5.6 billion in current debt.\n\nIts board was in a perilous spot. Its special committee was tasked with approving Lampert's other plan, [a bid to buy his storied Kenmore appliance business and other brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/eddie-lamperts-hedge-fund-esl-proposes-to-buy-kenmore-brand-sears-real-estate.html). Approving his offer would have helped Sears make its payment. But it would also thrust the board the spotlight, potentially opening them to the threat of litigation from shareholders who might allege Lampert has stripped the business bare.\n\n#### Homes to Hardware\n\nThat business was once a giant. It started with Richard Sears, [who launched the Sears Watch Co. in 1886](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html) to sell watches by mail. The company later evolved into Sears, Roebuck and Co., which sold everything from homes to hardware through a catalog. The convenience brought its products to America's most rural locations.\n\nIn 1925, Sears morphed a mail-order plant on Chicago's West Side into its first retail store. By the end of the year. Sears opened seven more stores. Eventually, Sears became the largest U.S. retailer, and its house brands like Kenmore and Craftsman earned spots as staples in homes across the country. Generations of children marked the holidays by paging through its holiday catalog, known as the \"Wishbook,\" wondering if they would receive any of the toys inside.\n\nAs Sears success grew, so did its empire. It moved into Chicago's iconic Sears Tower, and for a time, owned financial services businesses like Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group.\n\nBut [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) topped Sears as the biggest U.S. retailer in 1990. Its efforts to attract female shoppers by showing them the \"softer side of Sears\" and move into new businesses lines left it without a identity.\n\nThose challenges didn't stop Lampert, the hedge fund manager who had already impressed Wall Street with his acumen when he seemingly turned around Kmart, which he bought in 2004. He acquired and combined Sears with Kmart in 2005, arguing that two ailing retailers were stronger together than apart. The financial guru saw valuable real estate, customers he could parlay from one store to the other and ample costs to cut.\n\nThe retail giant he created had a market capitalization north of $20 billion in 2006. The media began to wonder whether he was the \"next Warren Buffett.\" Lampert could have sold off his investments then, but stayed on, steadfast in his vision of the combined retailers.\n\nMeanwhile, Walmart and [Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TGT) kept opening stores, as did [Lowe's](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LOW)and [Home Depot](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HD). Walmart touted its \"everyday low prices,\" while Target served up \"cheap chic.\" Lowe's and Home Depot provided a wider array of home improvement products for all kinds of projects, making it tough for Kenmore and Craftsman to compete.\n\nThen, came a double blow.\n\nConsumer spending slowed during the Great Recession, especially for big-ticket items like washers and dryers. Cash-strapped shoppers began using the internet to hunt down the best deals. Gradually, they began to spend more online and avoid the mall, fueling Amazon's rise. Sears' 140,000-square-foot stores began to seem monstrous as foot traffic declined.\n\nWalmart and others began to invest in their businesses to compete with Amazon, but Sears never had that chance. It simply didn't have the funds.\n\nSears' last profitable year was in 2010. A thinning cash flow has left little money to put back into the company itself, letting it become more irrelevant. For the past five years, the ratio of Sears' capital expenditures to sales has been less than one percent. That's even as its sales have more than halved in the same time period.\n\nSears has been in survival mode for more than a decade. Unable to rely on the Sears' business to pay the bills, [Lampert instead sold or spun off many of its most valuable stores and brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html).\n\nSince its merger with Kmart, Sears has spun off its Lands' End clothing brand, sold the Craftsman tool brand to [Stanley Black &amp; Decker](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/) and closed hundreds of stores. It spun out 250 of its best properties into real estate investment trust offshoot known as [Seritage](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SRG).\n\nIts key vendors, wary of Sears' future, [demanded tighter payment terms](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/08/sears-same-store-sales-q3-2017.html). Some, like Whirlpool, [stopped shipping all-together.](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/sears-cuts-ties-with-whirlpool-and-will-stop-selling-its-appliances.html)\n\nIt has been grappling with a pension of roughly 100,000 retirees that, as of January 2018, was underfunded by $1.5 billion, according FactSet.\n\nIt became a guessing game among analysts and onlookers whether each of Sears' last five holiday seasons would be its last. But Lampert kept surprising them, extending a lifeline in the form of loans from his hedge fund ESL Investments, or finding them elsewhere, each time bankruptcy looked inevitable.\n\nLampert, though, sounded the alarm in a Sept. 13 [blog post](https://blog.searsholdings.com/eddie-lampert/update-on-our-transformation/). He pleaded for Sears' creditor's to agree to restructure, calling out the risks should they drag their feet.\n\n\"We continue to believe that it is in the best interests of all our stakeholders to accomplish this as a going concern, rather than alternatives that could result in significant reductions in value,\" he wrote.\n\nBy early October, it became evident that Sears' last Christmas before bankruptcy had already passed. Sears began to [raise emergency financing to support the business through coming filing](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/sears-arranges-financing-for-a-potential-bankruptcy.html).\n\nNow, the question will be whether Sears will be able to come out of bankruptcy. [Retailers don't have a great track record of emerging](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/here-are-the-retailers-that-have-filed-for-bankruptcy-so-far-this-year.html). Several of late, like Toys R Us and department store Bon-Ton, have been forced to liquidate. It is difficult to make changes needed, like investing in e-commerce, stores and a company's brand, while still catering to creditors' demands.",

In addition,  I witnessed a major mall within a heavily populated city, right off a major highway and road go out of business. To me, that speaks volumes about this shift in the way consumers do business. ",

When I was in highshool, a large number of teens would hang out outside the local theater (that was part of the new high end strip mall). After a few years of this, the mall decided to shut that down and put up and enforced \"no loitering\" sign.\n\nMy city growing up received some highway funds to make improvements. They decided to put some nice benches up at a couple of major intersections on the main drag through town. One night some friends and I were sitting in them hanging out, and a cop stopped by and told us we couldn't sit there because it was no loitering zone. My city didn't have any kind of public transit, so was I was \"WTF are these benches for except for people to sit down and hang out?\" and he told me to watch the attitude and move along.\n\nAnyway, no fucking wonder so many teenagers do stupid shit and get into trouble. Suburbs shut down anything else viable for them to do to stay entertained.",

The model of having a bunch of clothing stores, four big-boxes, and a food court that served so well in the 60s-90s is just dead now.\n\n- Traditional \"mall\" big-boxes are all struggling, if they haven't disappeared already.\n- This might sound sexist, but 50% of your demographic doesn't care about clothing retail, so you've eliminated a huge chunk of clients right off the bat. ^(not ^that ^there ^aren't ^some ^men ^that ^care ^about ^fashion, ^or ^some ^women ^that ^don't, ^but ^there ^are ^certainly ^general ^trends)\n- Nobody wants Sbarro's or A&amp;W food from the food court.\n\nPeople crave experiences right now, and they'll go to places and pay prices for those things. That doesn't mean that malls have to completely abandon retail (they definitely shouldn't), but the property owners are going to have to get creative, and probably drop rental prices on some \"entertainment-focused\" options, and treat them as a loss-leader. A really great example of a mall that's doing it right is \"Great Lakes Crossing\" in Auburn Hills, MI. They are an outlet mall, and have lots of traditional retailers, but they also have:\n\n- Rainforest Cafe restaurant\n- Sea Life aquarium\n- Lego Land\n- Movie Theater\n- Bowling / Arcade\n- 3-4 other 'non-mall' casual sit-down restaurants \n- Massive food court with a mix of mall and non-mall fast food options\n- Carousel in the food court\n\nThat place is SLAMMED, any time of year, and you basically can't even go there from Thanksgiving to New Years, it's so busy. Then there are a bunch of traditional malls within a 100 mile radius that are all struggling because nobody wants to go there anymore (and all their anchor stores are, of course, closing).\n\nTL;DR Adapt or die, old mall model won't cut it anymore.",

I've traveled all over the country, to cities big and small, and it's really eye opening.\n\nIn an area doing well there will be multiple malls.  They will be crowded.  They will have at least one, and maybe several higher end stores (Apple, Dyson, Ann Taylor, Diesel, L'Occitane).  They will have high end restaurants in and around them.  There will be a buzz.  There will be no empty storefronts, or if there is it will clearly be actively and quickly renovated into the next store.  Outside will be new parking garages with the lights that tell you how many spots are open.\n\nIn an area doing poorly, there will be one or more completely closed malls.  The malls still open will often have adapted, for instance grafting on a Bass Pro shop in place of an old anchor.  They will typically have at least one anchor store vacant, and usually many vacant internal stores with no signs of life in years.  The food court will be a sad looking affair of a few fast food places and perhaps a \"local\" place that's taken over a former name brand fast food counter.  It will have few customers at dinner time.  Outside the parking lot will look like a war zone of pot holes.  \n\nAnd yes, there are places in between.  Cities with two malls, one doing ok with all of it's stores filled, but no high end brands, and one more like the latter I described.  There's a whole spectrum. But ultimately walking into a couple of malls will tell you how prosperous a city is in very short order.",

Both are doing horribly; the one I have is still \"nice\", in that it's clean and safe, but it's empty and only has maybe 10 stores in it.  The other one?  It has more stores, but it's a gang hangout and overgrown. \n\nAnd it really is a good mirror of the surrounding economy.  We don't have things like Apple or Bose stores here, or Dyson or Ann Taylor.  The only place to get consumer electronics is BestBuy.  We have a Walmart and a Target, Sams Club, etc.  But the people around here are some dense, they think the economy is \"flourishing.\"",

You can tell a lot from what the local mall is like, what kind of stores are there, and what kind of people shop in it. For instance I grew up in an area of lower middle class, some upper middle class at the highest. They tried to open a Coach store in our mall and it flopped, no one ever went in or out but things like tennis shoe stores and Abercrombie always did well and it was always crowded but periodic crime. That area is overcrowded and they keep adding cheap apartments everywhere and the crime is getting worse and the stores keep changing when we go. The lower class household area has a mall that is currently being rented out as office spaces because they couldn't keep the stores open.\n\nThe upperclass area has a mall with a riverwalk and fancy stores and little to no crime. The area we are moving to is kind of in the middle and the mall shows it by having some Michael Kors and Banana Republic stores but still mixed with H&amp;M and Forever 21. It's also very clean with little crime. \n\nIt's not a fantastic indicator but I do agree that how well the malls are doing definitely shows how well an area is doing.",

Where does the money come from?\n\nOn the other hand, I don't understand why mall owners don't try to modernize their properties and bring in more crowds.  Most of them have a huge space to work with and a MASSIVE carrying capacity, and yet... you never hear about a mall being an event center, or running gimmicky events to get people in the door.  They don't even advertise give-aways, if they still do them.  The number one complaint I've heard from possible tenants is the rent is blisteringly high for almost no foot traffic -- but they never lower rental rates, only raise them.  Shady people hanging around?  That's okay!  We can't be bothered to address that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only thing I can come up with is all malls must be criminal fronts or something.",

When large-scale commercial developments are first in the planning stages with the local government, developers and financers, before any buildings even go up there are things put in place called Reciprocal/Operational Easement Agreements.\n\nREA/OEA Declarations are publically recorded, legally binding documents that run with the land forever until amended or the REA abolished. They define the different plots of land available for sale, dictate the responsibilities of the different parcel owners with respect to building upkeep and common area maintenance, and also establish usage restrictions to maintain a certain type and class of customer base. Common prohibited uses include governmental functions of any kind, bars, offices, anything that produces excessive or potentially obnoxious noise or smell, or anything that would increase the insurance requirements of the building owner beyond a certain limit, along with a laundry list of other things.\n\nDepending on the age of the development, current mall owners may be forced to comply with rules that were set down prior even to the emergence of the home PC, let alone large-scale internet sales. This is a totally unprecedented situation today that commercial property owners are not legally able to efficiency adapt to. Could an REA be amended to lessen the prohibited uses? Sure, but it would take a lot of work and time and money, and require the agreement of all the parcel owners. Thanks to commercial real estate management companies constantly shuffling around their portfolios, by the time you got everybody in the center onboard with the amendments some parcel would probably get sold and you'd have to start all over again with the new owner.\n\nSource: work in commercial real estate",

And I like to shop when there's things to DO in the store.  That's why I love bookstores (and loathe that they've died out) and marketplaces like farmer's markets and flea markets.  When it comes to furniture, artwork, books, electronics, housewares, gadgets, etc -- I want to try before I buy.  I would definitely shop in a mall, if the mall had actual stuff to DO, and wasn't reduced to a bunch of clothing outlets with clothes I will never, ever buy or wear.\n\nBestBuy is bouncing back from Amazon because they caught on to the fact that people were using their store to check out displays, then buying on Amazon for price -- so now they'll price match in the store.  You can shop from Ikea online, but people want to go to see those amazing displays they have.  PetSmart has live animals, camps, classes, and in-store services.\n\nI think clothing and grocery shopping is AWFUL.  Push a buggy around a crowded store with concrete floors and no cell reception for an hour, then you have to drag in everything from the car across a dozen trips, lol.  There's no reward, and these days, people want reward.  They want a service.\n\n",

                    "comment": "And in smaller malls where Sears is the anchor, domino effect on nearby smaller retailers.\n\nAlso going to likely continue to be an issue as this goes on: \"A co-tenancy clause in retail lease contracts allows tenants to reduce their rent if key tenants or a certain number of tenants leave the retail space. A large or key tenant is a big draw for traffic, especially in malls, and are often one of the major reasons a tenant chooses to locate in a specific mall.\" (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cotenancy-clause.asp)\n\nThe problems with retail aren't over; Sears is ch 11 (and with all the discussion from Sears about a turnaround by shrinking to a smaller Sears - one could have some confidence in that if Sears ever showed an ability to be a successful retailer in the Lampert era but it has not), JCP is more than likely gone. Pier 1 is gone. Bed Bath and Beyond is going to have to start shrinking if someone doesn't save it from itself.  Gamestop has a ridiculous amount of locations and while \"the eventual irrelevance of Gamestop because downloads\" has been a discussion for years, all the sudden we're now having discussions about game streaming. L Brands continues to get obliterated because VS has no plan against Aerie. \n\nThe right-sizing of retail is going to probably continue to take years. A lot fewer malls in the end (many B/Cs are going to be gone) and the A's are going to be renovated/redeveloped and densified with more in the way of apartments and other non-retail amenities (BAM is doing this with GGP.) I don't think the interest in retail real estate will ever be what it once was (Brookfield barely paid a premium for what it didn't already own of GGP earlier this year - it was bought for less than half of what it was at the peak in 2007) and with this whole Sears situation, it's becoming more evident that the end goal was Seritage, which is a lot less appealing of an end goal than it was 10 years ago. That, plus I'd be surprised if there isn't some attempts to go after Seritage for fraudulent conveyance.\n\nUrban Outfitters CEO from March of 2017:\n\n\"Retail square feet per capita in the United States is more than six times that of Europe or Japan. And this doesn\u2019t count digital commerce. Our industry, not unlike the housing industry, saw too much square footage capacity added in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThousands of new doors opened and rents soared. This created a bubble, and like housing, that bubble has now burst. We are seeing the results, doors shuttering and rents retreating. This trend will continue for the foreseeable future, and may even accelerate.\"\n\nI actually think this whole thing has played out in a fairly slow manner because things have been good. When things turn South, it will accelerate.\n\nLastly, with all the discussion of GE over the last year or so on here, I think the dictionary definition of \"value trap\" that people haven't talked about as much is BBBY. There have been threads about how cheap it appears, but read the conference calls, look at store operations and you'll find management that is totally incapable and store operations that haven't adapted nearly as quickly enough as they should have (and the \"turnaround story\" continues to be less than advertised.) Something can *appear* cheap, but actually look at it, read conference calls, etc and consider whether or not it's cheap for a reason. BBBY is JCP if someone doesn't play savior, take it over and put more capable management in place.",

On the one hand, there is a place for a store that sells the things that it does. As a customer, I very much enjoy BBBY. I also think its a great idea how they are rolling out these min-mall type deal with all their brands. Everytime I walk into one, I see more customers than I saw the last time. \n\nThen again, as I listened into the last earnings call, it felt like management had no real reason to explain their performance. The seem to be deflecting to tariffs, which is hard to believe. They got defensive when answering questions. That earnings call made me sell my investment and cut my losses. \n\nI'm not totally convinced the BBBY is on the same path as Sears, but i'm also not willing to take that risk. For now, I'll just stay a happy customer. ",

I see a lot of people shitting on malls in this thread but reluctant and failing anchor tenants can be a big part of the problem too, Sears and JC Penny being the two which come to mind.  Many malls want to redesign and upscale but can't because anchor tenants have such strong agreements and can't afford to temporarily close down for renovations or rebuilds.  Our local mall did a rebuild but none of the anchor stores wanted to close down so the whole plan had to change from an open mixed use town center style setup to a normal enclosed mall.  It still worked out relatively well but the JC Penny is still a blight since they did nothing to update the interior during the process.  It's still got the same scuffed walls, ratty 30+ year old carpet and so forth.  A lot of mall owners are literally dying to revamp and attract higher end tenants but can't because these old anchor stores won't sign off on it.\n",

Felt bad at how empty they were so before my honeymoon I went in one to buy dresses and swimsuits for it and after an hour of looking around didn't like anything. Went to look at their jewelry and it was way overpriced. A couple weeks ago we went into a Sears because we've been shopping around for appliances and they were being marked as $1000+ more than Best Buy and Lowes/Home Depot and then \"on sale\" for the normal price as the other stores. I just don't feel like I can connect to their apparel, their appliances are overpriced, and their home stuff is also a high price too. Things I didn't have as much issues with in a Macys.",

All investing aside, techniques to save money on the sales floor itself just weren't there. Their rewards system was a joke, I myself managed to get at least $100 worth of clothing for no more than $15. \n\nThe set up of the stores didn't help either. Our numbers at the time showed we were losing nearly $1 million a year on comforters (of all things). Where were they placed? Right next to the large mall entrance farthest away from our camera room. Even if we did manage to see them select and conceal it, the chance of grabbing them once they left the store was minimal. To top it all off, the back corner of the section was a blind spot, so even if the did walk in without it then leave with it, our policy for stopping shoplifters said we needed to have the selection and concealment on camera and we couldn't do anything about it without dancing on the line. \n\nThe biggest thing that didn't make sense to me was we were discouraged to stop shoplifters that stole anything worth $20 or less. I can tell you that unless the person got wild, this was a majority of what we saw. Granted, a necklace worth $15 is nothing compared to other big ticket items, but when you see 3 or 4 a day? Guess what, you're losing money. And that report we wrote that concluded with 'no stop made' was rarely looked into, deemed not worth it. \n\nMy point of view on Sears is definitely more from the bottom than the investors at the top, but I feel like even if the creditors did want to restructure, they would still need to completely overhaul their physical set up and their asset protection department.

I got this teenager sounding fellow on the phone and I asked him about said motor brushes. He put me on hold then when he got back on he started listing all the brushes he had in stock; \"....I have plastic brushes, bristle brushes, bench brushes....\" I cut him off and said; \"Thanks buddy but I need a motor brush, do you know what I'm talking about?\" He immediately got smart with me and said; \"Yeh I know what a motor brush I don't need to be told what I know maybe these brushes I listed will fit your ummmmm *rooter table*...\" I cut him off there and asked; \"Do you have a manager or tool repairman available?\"\n\n*Loooooong pause*\n\nOlder but equally ridden with attitude voice; \"Hello? Yeh so my store associate has listed to you what we have available for your router.\" I said; \"Ok, well your guy has listed off hand brushes, for like sweeping dust. I need a *CARBON MOTOR BRUSH* for a sears brand router power tool. It's a motor part, *NOT A HAND HELD BRUSH*.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" said the bad attitude manager. \n\nHe then said; \"You'll have to find that online we don't stock that.\"\n\nI then hung up. I found my brushes online. I've never gone back to Sears for anything, at all.",

Millennials are pushing 30s by the time they can start a good career prospect and probably still burdened with student loans to have disposable income. Of course there are exceptions and they might amass wealth once they hit their 50s, but it seems like they\u2019ve had a late start than the previous generations. Every generation has their own struggle.",

They kept cutting commissions, treated employees terribly, had a nightmare inventory management system, among a litany of other issues that trickled down to a very poor customer experience.  When I left I said they'd be out of business in 5 years.  Underestimated the power of creative accounting.  RIP Sears\n\nEdit: 85% of my time was spent cleaning the place or watching ratatouille/kung fu panda on constant loop.  We rarely had customers and when we did the grimy salesmen with bad breathe always jumped them.  Good times",

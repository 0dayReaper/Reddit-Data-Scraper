    "postText": "As someone interested in playing a stock or investing sim, I've been a little disappointed with the lack of quality options. It seems the ones that exist either incentivize short term/high-risk trading, or they're too gamified and don't promote real world strategies. \"Build your Stax\" is closer to something I had in mind but still lacking in many critical areas.\n\nFor those in a similar situation, have you found any worthwhile games besides paper money stock markets? Also, what are some things you'd be looking for in an investing game?",

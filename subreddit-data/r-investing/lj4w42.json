Chernobyl was a freak disaster where everyone that could go wrong actually went wrong, this will never happen again. Three Mile Island was responsible for exactly zero deaths and was blown out of proportion by the media and Fukushima was arguably only responsible for 1 death and only the result of a badly placed back up generator. Nuclear power is one of, if not the, safest forms of energy we have.\n\nYour gut would be correct sadly",

But if you followed Fukushima, they were having issues transferring deisel fuel into the tanks on the ground, so putting the generators on the roof means you now need infrastructure to pump fuel up to the roof, and if that infrastructure breaks, that infrastructure failure is another disaster.",

Add in passive safety and CANDU vacuum towers, and we have a safe, zero-carbon, baseload source of energy that could be brought online within this decade.",

What we are piss-poor at is separating the perception of risk from its reality, and letting facts take precedence over feelings. We are easily panicked by isolated, dramatic events (Chernobyl, 9/11) while accepting far higher costs from systemic, low-burn problems (global warming, automobile deaths).\n\nIt's risk management, not risk magicking-away. We do have accidents at thermal power plants and refineries, and the solution was not to abandon them and build no more ever, again. Incidentally, nuclear is the safest form of power in terms of lives lost per unit of energy produced. It has been producing power safely and without incidence in Ontario and France for decades.\n\nThe automobile accident rate in 1970 was 28 per 100,000; in 2017, it was 12 per 100,000. The solution there also was not to abandon the technology, but to work on the problem through education and safety devices. Insisting that products or processes be perfectly safe before they are permitted to exist is not a recipe for progress, but stagnation.",

The idea of what a nuclear plant is has been changing, and 10 years brings HUGE changes in tech. Rather than having 1 very large core, which can cause serious damage if it were to break containment, and requires significant safety measures to make sure you can cool it, there are now small mini-reactors about the size of a water cooler that can be self-contained and cool themselves down in the event of an emergency. These mini-reactors can be stacked and linked together to upscale energy production as needed.",

They are perfectly safe to touch and simply sit in a now-restricted part of the parking lot (regulations state that even unusable nuc waste must be surveiled by specially trained law enforcement 24/7).",

The &lt;1 gram iridium gamma ray sources I use at my job are each shielded with ~23 kilograms of depleted uranium. \n\nAs for OPs question about waste, certain types of reactors can use waste products of other reactors as fuel. It's not readily available technology yet, but there are designs for molten salt reactors that can run on spent nuclear fuel that are in the testing phase now. We do have designs already, such as the CANDU reactors in Canada, that can run on unenriched uranium, which can be seen as something of a stepping stone for these future generations of reactors. \n\nSome nuclear fuels can be partially recycled as well which, while not removing nuclear waste from the equation entirely, can slow down the rate at which we generate unusable nuclear waste.",

Solar PV and wind have gotten to the point where they are cheaper to build then the turbines and cooling towers let alone the nuclear reactor to generate the steam. With batteries at the point where it only costs 1-2 cents to store a kWh of electricity it solves the intermittency problem.\n\nRight now solar, wind, hydro and natural gas are the cheapest with  solar and wind getting cheaper every year. For energy storage lithium batteries keep getting cheaper and pumped hydro storage facilities are being built.\n\nCompared to wind/solar nuclear is triple the cost and coal is double. Also, solar thermal and fusion energy both need steam turbines so I don't see them catching on due to costs.\n\nI'm not suggesting we stop research into nuclear and I personally find the designs that Bill Gates is working on quite exciting. However, there is going to need to be a huge breakthrough to catch up to the every falling renewables cost.\n\nSource of electricity costs: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost\\_of\\_electricity\\_by\\_source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source)",

I don't think we will see the intermittency problem appropriately addressed until it's already causing serious problems. There's just too much political opposition to nuclear (and even hydro by some here in Canada), and the issues with wind and solar are just slightly too technical for the general public to grasp it. \n\nPolitically it makes sense to promote wind/solar as a panacea\n\nIt's a shame, because the construction cycle for nuclear and large scale hydro is about a decade. If we take another decade to finally arrive at a place politically where we accept that hydro and nuclear expansion is a key component of a zero carbon future, we won't be bringing those new units online until the mid 2040s",

You could end the conversation here. But to go into more detail, although energy is largely policy driven with respect to incentives, it still follows basic market economics just like any other commodity. And the cheaper energy source will always win, from a developer perspective, and from a market perspective.\n\nOn to the dynamics of the grid, energy markets are unlike all others, as energy has to be consumed immediately as it's produced. Or, in other words, generation has to follow demand, else the grid doesn't work and you get blackouts. This effectively breaks out energy into baseload power vs peak load. Baseload power effectuvely runs 24/7, and peak power responds, in varying levels, to demand. Some of this is predictable, some of it isn't. Nuclear provides base load power. The grid is changing though, and nuclear can't meet the needs of a dynamic grid.\n\nLastly the time for climate action is immediate, and the timeline for nuclear deployments takes years to decades. Whereas solar can be deployed in a couple months. There's also risk involved with sunk cost of a nuclear power plant vs falling solar and wind costs, but that's another conversation. \n\nThe answer is whatever the cheapest source of generation paired with storage, smart storage is the missing link. That answer is solar + wind paired with storage.",

Now, due to tons of taxpayer investment, those soft, decentralized alternatives' cost efficiency is immediately more attractive, so we shouldn't spend any investment in the technology that we stunted, even though it is far more promising for both the near and far future.\nYou claim that a nuclear energy plant is not fit to increase or decrease it's output based on demand. That capability has existed for at least half a century.\nWhy wouldn't nuclear plus storage be an option as well?\nTo say that we can't build nuclear plants because it's too late and the planet will be doomed if we don't reduce co2 emission by x amount by year x is a condemnation of any point you make.",

It takes up to a decade and $10 billion to build a single modern plant. Secondly, the global know-how and capability to build nuclear power plants is severely limited because of the unpopularity of nuclear plants. You couldn't even build the required plants in time if you wanted to. Deploying nuclear energy would be a generational approach and not a quick solution.\n \nAs more renewables are being plugged into the grid, it's becoming apparent that with smart grid management, power storage and distributed renewables and extra capacity, it's absolutely possible to meet the required power demands in 99% of the situations. \n\nHere in the Netherlands an article came out just today about how grid operators are now working with heavy industry to help them deal with fluctuations. One example given was a smelting plant which draws as much power as a city of 200,000 people. It's orders of magnitude cheaper to have them shut down for a few hours and pay them to do that, than to add grid storage or fire up a peaker plant. They're also talking about paying them for modifications to their setup, so the smelter can shut down for up to 48h without any damage to the process. This comes out to be 10x as cheap as building grid storage of equivalent capacity. The whole base load argument is very quickly being disproven, and by the time you have the first nuclear plants up and running, the grid itself will likely already have adapted to be much more flexible.\n\nIn addition to this, solar and wind currently are a factor 3 cheaper than nuclear energy, and will continue to experience reductions in costs in the coming decade. That means right now, already you could build 300% of needed capacity in renewables for the equivalent price in nuclear. The interesting point to watch will likely be the cost per Mwh of renewables + storage. Currently there are hundreds of gigawatts of battery production plants being added which will drive the costs of batteries down and the availability up. In a few years lots of battery capacity coming from the first EV's will also be available to use for grid storage. These batteries will have degraded to about 80% of capacity, which means they are useless for vehicles, but perfectly fine for grid storage. Other innovative solutions (such as pumped hydro storage) are of course being worked on and we can expect grid storage to only experience a decline in price as well. \n\nNuclear energy is honestly just a bit of a techno-utopist illusion at the moment. By the time you have the first plants up and running, it will be obsolete. The mother of all megatrends of solar/wind/grid storage is happening world wide right now, versus the objectively small and comparatively negligent nuclear industry. It just does not compare. Betting on nuclear now is just wasting resources and very unnecessary.",

Nuclear is much more expensive on the front-end compared to fossil fuels, wind, or solar.  Decommissioning current nuclear reactors is happening while building new ones is not.  Aside from the public perspective and political fight against nuclear, its economic feasibility isn't attractive to equity investors who want to see a quick return.  Public utilities commissions are focused on distributed energy resources behind-the-meter like solar applications on homes.  That's the expectation to take the country off fossil fuels at this point.  If there is to be a nuclear revolution of public utilities, there will have to be more support that comes directly from utilities commissions and that in turn will have to come from popular support from the public.",

The current regulations make nuclear plants so expensive and time-consuming to engineer and operate, it's not even funny. Mini reactors would disadvantage nuclear even more by making scaling on costs worse.\n\nI'm going to respectfully disagree with you. There are several companies in the late stages of designing SMRs(small modular reactors) and it solves a lot of problems that larger 1000MW+ plants have to deal with. These companies consist of GE Hitachi, Nuscale, and Rolls Royce and other smaller companies.\n\n- Scalability and streamlining designs. One of the biggest fuck ups the US nuclear industry put on themselves was not having a standardized design per company. EVERY plant is wildly different, Westinghouse(who built most PWR's in the states) has so much variability in their designs that it's hard to streamline construction and implement efficient logistics and processes during construction. GE was better about this with their BWR designs, but it's still not standardized. France did it right by standardizing many of there plants through government intervention. SMR's have the benefit of being built in a factory so the designs and systems will be identical. Economies of scale will pay dividends on these plants.\n\n- Smaller reactors means less emergency core cooling robustness and residual heat removal. A huge burden of full scale plants is having safeguards to respond in case of LOCA's(loss of coolant accidents) or loss of off site power. Even when the plant is shutdown , you gotta constantly cool the core with recirculated flow or things start to heat up and melt. This includes expensive upkeep of 2+ massive emergency diesel generators(per unit), redundant trains of residual heat removal systems, and high pressure injection systems. The greatest benefit of SMRs is the fact they are air cool able after 72 hours of shutdown. I can't overstate how important this is; if you lose power in an SMR, the stored water on site will be able to cool off the plant for the first three days(through natural recirc!), from there, the reaction will decay to the point that air can cool if off. It will be walk away safe.\n\n- Smaller exclusion zones. To the public, this will be huge. Right now, NRC regulations require very thorough emergency procedures for the area within 50 miles of a NPP. This will be reduced to 10(and that is overkill) for SMRs. \n\n- None of the SMR's are 'new' designs. They are just streamlined, proven designs of the larger plants. There is nothing fundamentally novel about any of 'em(at least, the ones close to being finished). The GE hitachi SMR is just a compact ESBWR(Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor), which has already been scrutinized by the NRC and has passed initial licensing. Truly novel, new designs have to go through a litany of research and testing by the regulatory agency to get the 'go ahead,' but SMRs are still traditional plants. \n\nSo yes, while ALL power generation does benefit from larger boilers/reactors through sheer thermodynamic principle; the minor loss of power generation efficiency will be minor compared to the benefits that small nuclear plants have by removing some of the unique problems inherent to splitting the atom on huge scales.",

That means every 18-24 months these plants need to shutdown and do an outage to refuel. \n\nA ~1 month outage every two years is not a problem in any sense, and is perfectly acceptable for light water reactors. Many plants run breaker to breaker, and going offline is an absolutel necessity for any power plant, non-nuclear included. Maintenance needs to be done regardless, and some of that maintenance can only be done during shutdown. \n\nShutting down for a month every two years is such a non-issue, I'm surprised someone 'pro nuclear' would even bring it up. And operation costs are actually relatively low for nuke plants, all the cost is front loaded at construction, which will be improved with SMRs.",

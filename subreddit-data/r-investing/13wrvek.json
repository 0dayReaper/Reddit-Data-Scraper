    "postText": "As it stands I hold AT&amp;T at a average price of $18.19.\n\nT has been trading around $15.50-$16 for about a couple weeks now with $15.50ish looking like the bottom. I was looking at Put and Call options out of curiosity to see what premiums I could make.\n\nI don\u2019t have a big holding of T But as it stands I\u2019m down about $250.\n\nMy question is this. What are the risks of selling a $18.5 or a $19 Put option for the premium of June 2nd?\n\nThe option would sell above what my loss is of around $275. What are the risks of doing this that I\u2019m unaware of? I don\u2019t see how this doesn\u2019t let me exit my position without a lost if I wanted too.",

            "comment": "Selling a Put means that you are selling someone the right to force you to buy shares from them at the strike price. You're going to need to have the cash available to make that purchase (or enough excess margin) should you be assigned. The assignment can happen any time between the moment that you sell the Put and the end of the auction.\n\nI don't think that this is what you have in mind.\n\nI think that what you're intending is to sell a Call. Seeing as how you already own the shares, this is referred to as a 'Covered Call'. IOW, the shares that you own 'cover' your obligation to deliver shares if assigned. And just like with Puts, the assignment can happen any time between the moment that you sell the Call until the end of the auction.\n\nDepending on your situation, your broker may prevent you from selling the shares covered by the Call until after the end of the auction.\n\nAs for your question about a loss, imagine that the value of the stock goes up. It's not unusual for the premium on the option to go up above the price that you received when you opened this position.",

The fees on options may be higher than you expect.\n\nIf 'T' closes at or above $13 per share at the end of the regular session this Friday you will be assigned on Saturday. When the markets open on Monday the shares will be out of your account.",

To exit the put contract you would need to buy it back with cash (losing money if T has dropped) or lots of 100 short shares.\n\nFor each hundred shares of T you own you could instead sell a covered call option at a higher strike. If the price is flat or declines you pocket the premium. If it climbs, your shares appreciate but they are called away so you may miss out on some of the gains.\n\nAnother approach could be buying a put against the shares you own as a risk-management/insurance against further drops, expecting to lose the premium on those puts if it rises but lowering your cost basis if it falls.",

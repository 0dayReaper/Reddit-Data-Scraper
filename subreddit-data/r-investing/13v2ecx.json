    "postText": "Inflation seems to have fallen out of the headlines recently given the lower CPI readings in the past few months. The market seems to be pricing a pretty significant decline in interest rates based on the forward SOFR curve. Does anyone think this not right?\n\nJust log on to your Amazon account and have a look at items you bought in 2020 or early 2021. Every single item that I have bought has increased 25% to 100%+ in the past 3 years. You see it at Costco, you see it at restaurants.\n\nWage growth has only really occurred on a percentage basis for the lower skilled minimum wage job, and nowhere enough to cover the massive cost of living increases.\n\nIs wage price inflation off the table because people are too scared of losing their jobs? Do people just accept a lower standard of living than before?\n\nI can really only see inflation going away if people accept a lower standard of living and not push for higher wages.\n\nEDIT: Not saying inflation is going to 0%, but I'm thinking it's too early to assume we are headed back down to 2% and the job is done. I think it's way more likely we stay in this 4% to 5% range or even head higher from here if wage inflation starts to kick in because people are not content with the diminished buying power.",

In fact, in cases of monetary inflation (that is, there\u2019s no major shortage, just too much money printing), what drives inflation is increased consumption. The price comes up until consumption returns to normal, expected levels. This is a simplified example, but the way stores set prices is simply aim for selling 95% of their stock. If they sell 97%, they raise the price slowly until they\u2019re back to selling 95%, and if they sell 93%, they drop prices until they\u2019re back to 95%. While this is not intuitive at a personal level(always take out your personal experience out of economics), it\u2019s a very reliable measure of demand when applied to a large population. If there\u2019s too much money around, people will buy more of everything, to the point where shelves can go empty due to over purchasing. That\u2019s why prices go up, to keep the shelves always stocked.",

The market seems to be pricing a pretty significant decline in interest rates based on the forward SOFR curve. Does anyone think this not right?\n\nNot really - inflation, as an economic phenomena, isn't historical or backwards looking. It's forward looking. Nor is it dictated by the BLS, Federal Reserve, or any sort of governmental or economic institution - it's dictated by participants in the market (you, me, everybody else) and what they're expectations are re: inflation going forward. \n\nI see you noted that in your OP (good job!) insofar as referencing forward SOFR rates, which should give you a clue as to the answer to your question \"Does anyone think this is not right?\" (hint: the answer is no)\n\n&gt;Just log on to your Amazon account and have a look at items you bought in 2020 or early 2021. Every single item that I have bought has increased 25% to 100%+ in the past 3 years. You see it at Costco, you see it at restaurants.\n\nUgh, dude, you can't just use a personal anecdote on how Amazon is pricing consumer goods (entirely during quarantine, no less...) to come to a conclusion that \"Forward markets are wrong - inflation is here to stay: just look at how Amazon was pricing fidget spinners in June 2020!!!\" and extrapolate that over the entire market is a huuuuge logical fallacy in your argument.\n\n&gt;Wage growth has only really occurred on a percentage basis for the lower skilled minimum wage job, and nowhere enough to cover the massive cost of living increases.\n\nAs is the case with tight, unskilled labor markets - supply is low, demand is high, so the price per unit of labor demanded goes up. Simple supply and demand economics, which should tell you something about the lack of wage growth in higher paying position and the market for folks to fill those positions (i.e. labor).\n\n&gt;Is wage price inflation off the table because people are too scared of losing their jobs? Do people just accept a lower standard of living than before?\n\nTo a certain extent, yes - that's a big reason the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Rates go up &gt;&gt; access to capital goes down &gt;&gt; cost of that capital goes up &gt;&gt; businesses in need of capital begin to fail &gt;&gt; layoffs occur / margins shrink &gt;&gt; aggregate demand goes down\n\n&gt;I can really only see inflation going away if people accept a lower standard of living and not push for higher wages.\n\nI mean....inflation is going to happen no matter what. That's sort of the whole point of a fractional reserve banking system. The question you **should** be asking is \"How fast and by what magnitude will inflation increase in the near term?\" \n\nTo answer that question, I'd point you towards where most futures markets are trading.",

            "comment": "Inflation is literally on a 10m 3% a year pace.\n\nInflation last 10m was 2.4%. Just look at price tables. 2.4% over 10 months, half of the current year over year was the 2 months 11-12 months ago.\n\nInflation will be 3.4% in 2 months if last reports monthly inflation happens 2x in a row from here.\n\nThat said... inflation above 3% will persist through 2023, it just won't be 4%+ anymore. Core doesn't really have a chance to fall below 4% until 2024 either.\n\nIf you define sticky as CPI-U is over 4% then it's not sticky, as it won't be in 2 months nor get back there this year.",

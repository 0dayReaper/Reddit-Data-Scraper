    "postText": "A while back in a different [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/12mwsbn/bonds_vs_bond_etfs/), a kind soul tried to explain bond funds to me. I thought about it, I read about it and I still don't get it.\n\nIt is my basic understanding that:\n\n- like bonds, bond fund prices fall when interest rates go up and vice versa\n- unlike bonds, bond funds do not repay the principal on maturity\n- bond funds also do not generally pay out coupons\n\nConsidering this, I think of individual funds as a predictable investment and of bond funds as essentially a bet on the direction of interest rate movement. I am pretty sure I am wrong! But I am not sure where. Can someone explain like I'm 5 what is good about bond funds? Why would someone invest in them, other than to bet on interest rates?",

Every month a bond expires and then you go out and buy a new 30 year bond.\n\nYour bond latter will never mature , every time one of your bonds mature you go out and buy a new bond. Also you average maturity basically stays pretty much the same every month bonds mature and every month you go out and buy new bonds with them.\n\nThis is different then holding a single bond. If you buy a 5 year bond and hold it, in 2 years well now you are holding a 3 year bond\n\nIn two more years you will now have 1 year bond. So as you hold your duration goes down. With a bond ladder as you keep buying new bonds your duration pretty much stays the same",

            "comment": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain.\r  \n\r  \nBond funds are mutual funds that invest in various types of bonds, like government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, etc. The objective of a bond fund is to provide investors with a steady stream of income through dividends while also preserving their capital.\r  \n\r  \nHere's an ELI5 explanation:\r  \n\r  \n*Imagine you want to lend your toys to your friends. Each friend promises to give you some candies every week as a \"thank you\" (like the interest payment, or \"coupon,\" of a bond), and after a certain amount of time, they promise to give your toy back (like when a bond \"matures\" and you get your initial investment, or \"principal,\" back).*\r  \n\r  \n*Now, suppose you have many friends, and you want to lend your toys to all of them. Keeping track of all these toys and candies can be difficult. So, you ask your big brother to manage it for you. Your big brother takes all your toys, lends them to your friends, collects the candies, and gives you your fair share. In this scenario, your big brother is like a bond fund. He manages a lot of bonds (toys) and distributes the income (candies) to the investors (you).*\r  \n\r  \nTo answer your points:\r  \n\r  \n**Bond Fund Prices and Interest Rates:** Like individual bonds, bond funds can decrease in value when interest rates rise. This is because when new bonds are issued at higher rates, the value of existing bonds (which pay lower rates) tends to decrease. Bond funds continually buy and sell bonds, so their value is affected by interest rate movements.\r  \n\r  \n**Repayment of Principal:** While it's true that bond funds don't have a maturity date where the principal is repaid all at once like individual bonds, investors can sell their shares in a bond fund at any time. The value of the shares will be determined by the current market value of the underlying bonds in the fund.\r  \n\r  \n**Coupon Payments:** Bond funds do pay out interest earned from the underlying bonds, but it's done differently than individual bonds. Bond funds typically pay out dividends to investors, which come from the interest payments the fund receives from the bonds it holds. These dividends can be reinvested to buy more shares of the fund if desired.\r  \n\r  \nThe benefits of investing in bond funds include:\r  \n\r  \n**Diversification:** Instead of investing in a single bond, a bond fund spreads your money across many bonds. This helps to reduce risk because if one bond performs poorly, it's only a small portion of your investment.\r  \n\r  \n**Professional Management:** Bond funds are managed by professionals who have the expertise to make informed investment decisions.\r  \n\r  \n**Liquidity:** You can buy and sell shares in a bond fund on any business day, providing more flexibility than individual bonds, which can sometimes be harder to sell.\r  \n\r  \n**Income Generation:** Bond funds aim to provide a steady stream of income through dividends, which can be a good option for investors looking for a regular income from their investments.\r  \n\r  \nWhile bond funds do have risks, such as interest rate risk and credit risk (the risk that bond issuers could default on their payments), they can play an important role in a balanced, diversified portfolio. They're not just a \"bet on interest rates,\" but a way to earn income and potentially preserve capital.",

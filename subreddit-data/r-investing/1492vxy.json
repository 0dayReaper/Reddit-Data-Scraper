    "postText": "Have a general question?  Want to offer some commentary on markets?  Maybe you would just like to throw out a neat fact that doesn't warrant a self post?  Feel free to post here! \n\nIf your question is \"I have $10,000, what do I do?\" or other \"advice for my personal situation\" questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:\n\n* How old are you? What country do you live in?  \n* Are you employed/making income? How much?  \n* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)  \n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  \n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  \n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)  \n* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?  \n* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.  \n\nPlease consider consulting our FAQ first - https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/faq\nAnd our [side bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/about/sidebar) also has useful resources.  \n\nIf you are new to investing - please refer to Wiki - [Getting Started](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/gettingstarted/)\n\nThe reading list in the wiki has a list of books ranging from light reading to advanced topics depending on your knowledge level.

            "comment": "I'm 29yrs old, make around 126k, no debt and very new to investing. I've so far opened a HYSA account and put the majority of my funds in there, also have 10k in ibonds that I invested and also maxed out on my 401k. Looking for suggestions on where else I invest my money in? I don't have much knowledge but I'm willing to learn. I've seen a lot of people talking about ETFs(cuz they don't need to be monitored like stocks), Roth IRA, health savings account etc. I wish I could provide a risk factor number but I sadly don't have knowledge on what would the appropriate amount even be?! \n\nWould like to know your thoughts on where do I have start off with? Literally any resources or suggestions will be helpful. Thanks in advance",

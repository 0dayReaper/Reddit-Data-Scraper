Some dude named Steve on YouTube where his wife makes him props (don\u2019t know the channel name) he\u2019s really good at explaining trickle down/up economics\n\nDon\u2019t listen to Graham Stephen or meet Kevin, I don\u2019t hate them, just...ugh. Clickbait.\n\nOther than that I have no clue where you should start. Everyone kinda sucks.",

You could buy anything and it would go up.  Everyone was YOLOing everything on everything, especially penny stocks, IPOs and options. Credit cards, home equity, loans against grand parents retirement accounts, any available dollar that could go into the market was pumped into the market, cuz tech was supposed to bring about the future.  And any Joe off the street could seemingly get money from investors for any startup and IPO with zero profit and just an idea and extravagant office.\n\nIt got to the point where the non trading types of folks were moonlighting and trading stocks and buying copies of the wsj. There were essentially memes (elevator quips) about how, \u201cwhen your middle aged neighbor that couldn\u2019t tell a mouse from a keyboard started talking about buying some stock, it was time to gtfo out of that stock.\u201d\n\n\u201c...in 1999, the height of the dotcom craze, there were 457 IPOs. Most were Internet and technology stocks. Of those, 117 doubled in price on the first day of trading. Tech and dotcom IPOs were minting new millionaires every day...\u201d\n\nThere were a handful of tweenage kids who had turned 1k into 1m portfolios the same exact way the same millionaire portfolios are being celebrated on Youtube and podcasts today. Instead of discord and Reddit communities, it was AIM and ICQ communities and phpBB message boards, while CNBC would highlight the crazy moves of the stocks.\n\nPets.com, webvan, ebay, netscape, amzn, eToys, intc, msft were all the rage the same way certain companies now are all the rage, eg aapl, tsla, nio, etc.\n\nWSB likes to meme about how the boomers are out of touch, but the boomers and gen X\u2019ers of yester year are the millennials and gen Z\u2019ers of right now. History is poised to repeat itself.\n\nWhen the real bear market and crash occurs, a lot of these traders are going to lose a lot of money and there will be the same set of winners and losers after the dust settles.  Some winners will lose it all, others will realize the same types of YOLO gains can\u2019t be made on a daily/weekly basis and drop out... and people will revert to their day jobs again...",

NIO has blown up, for example,  because EV is proving to become as prevalent as gas cars in the future. Investors are getting in now and yes the hype is causing extreme growth to the share price. \n\nCouple this with the ease of trading today, cue Robinhood, and you have a market we\u2019ve never seen before. \n\nCould it be a bubble akin to dot com? Possibly but I think it\u2019s very unlikely.",

Who's buying up all the real estate? Wealthy people. Whats actually experiencing inflation is assets, not commodities (it would be commodities if the middle and lower class were benefiting from the added money in circulation). So now we're seeing a wider wealth gap because regular people cant afford assets anymore. Buy up assets if possible and hold on for dear life, it'll pay off in the end.",

In recent times, at around $3M, you're earning $600k on \"bad years\" and well north of $1M on good years, especially if you've tilted towards most of the forward-looking sectors or even plenty of low-beta securities (e.g. Costco has returned over 22% per year when we look at it over the past 10 years; it did 33% last year and 46% in 2019).\n\nMost lifestyles do not require spending of anywhere near $600k per year, which is what a $3M portfolio has easily given you. Even if you were to buy a couple of exotic sports cars, a $3M home, pay for utilities/taxes, and get a gardner/cleaner to go along with it, you'd be lucky to break $35k/month in spending assuming you were paying on the house over 30 years. For people who acquire this amount of money and still retain their jobs, almost everything suddenly becomes attainable. As you indicated (and I 100% agree with), your lifestyle won't change that much at $10M vs what you can buy at $3M (unless of course you're into yachts or other real 0.5% items, in which case you'll need quite a bit more to sustain that lifestyle.)",

I recall arguing with someone here that a 90% chance at 10% gain is better than a 99.99999999% (because the market might collapse) chance at 5%.   No one wants to plan that they are going to be a loser  or even consider that possibility.   So once the channel starts suggesting things with a 60~80% chance to make it big for people with time to recover if it goes wrong, a lot of people are going to take that to be a guaranteed return.",

Make sure you have an emergency fund set asside as well as a low risk financial investment already in place like a 401k with matching company deposit. Let's say you've got to that level and now you have $500 set asside to start gambling and day trading Gordon Gecko style.\n \nThis is what I recommend doing... And take it from me, I'm an official Person On The Internet and have been trading stocks since April and bitcoin since 2017. Take your $500 (or whatever amount you're comfortable investing) and divide it by 12. Now each month you are going to take your 12th of an investment and toss it equally at ETFs (a collection of companies which means if you buy THCX youre basically betting on the future of the cannabis legalization and business opportunities of the future.)\n \nThis method outlined above takes you out of the equation. You don't know the future so we take you out of the equation as much as possible. You get to decide what sectors to invest in... But you don't really have to struggle with \"is this a good price?\" because you're just tossing your monthly investment expense at this project with the understanding it could take 10 years with inflation before you see gains. Never sell your shit until you've got gains. Wait 10-20 years if you have to. Don't risk what you can't wait 20 years on to see a profit. Don't risk too much!\n \nOkay so now you've got a Robinhood account and you've got some ETFs. People keep talking about Tesla and Apple so you buy some of their shares too. It's cool. Just don't get mad if it takes 15 years to get your gains. Eventually you will stumble into having several stocks and ETFs in your portfolio. You check it everyday..... Guess what? One of your investments has unusual gains over a short period of time. It pumps 20% on the 24 hour chart for example. What you have here is a hustle opportunity. What you do here is sell off a tiny portion of your holdings to reap in the profit of those sweet gains and then you schedule a buy back to purchase the same number of shares once the price drops 5-10%. Now you're Gordan Fucking Gecko wolf of wall st. Just like that.",

Now fueled by retail traders jumping in with options which hasn\u2019t happened before.\nBonds. Can\u2019t really get much lower without sinking the economy with negative interest rates.\nCryptocurrency - Bitcoin is deflationary since there is a fixed amount and coins will get lost over time.  Lookup deflation and currency to see why it\u2019s really bad.\nReal-estate is directly impacted by interest rates.  If interest rates go up the whole equities and real estate market collapses.  Nearly happened in September of 2019 and in March 2020.  This is why the fed panicked during those periods since the financial system nearly froze.\n\nA few of the people constantly right are Michael Hudson, Richard Werner, Jeff Snider, and Steve Keen.  The problem right now is you can be right on a macro level and the market is currently ignoring it.\n\nThings to keep in mind.  Banks create vastly more money than the Fed.  There currently isn\u2019t any accurate measurement of US dollar supply and the majority of it is estimated to be outside the US.  To learn more lookup Jeff Snider and Eurodollar university.\n\nPrinting money does create inflation.  It depends on who is getting the money.  IE if the vast majority of the money goes to the top 1% asset price inflate but CPI is relatively flat.  To see how extreme this can get lookup what happened in Japan in the 1980s.  This is a society/political choice which Michael Hudson and Richard Werner extensively cover.",

For ETFs be able to explain why the sector makes sense (for instance, if you think fintech is where it\u2019s at, why? Also go through the stocks in the ETF and make sure the majority are companies that you slips invest individually)\n5. Diversify. I know there\u2019s temptation to get risky with a sexy stock, but make sure you have stuff in \u201cboring\u201d stuff to anchor the portfolio \n\nAny other tips would be great, but that seems to be what\u2019s worked for me so far, even though I\u2019m expecting a bit of a smaller gain this year",

Unless you're a hedge fund or have tens of millions+ to invest and trade, I think most are wasting their time using most TA, or other trading told. The main thing I always find I use beyond any other indicator is support and resistance. Doesn't matter if day trading, swing trading, or buy and hold: all entries and exits and stops should be based on fundamental levels. \n\nA lot of \"traders,\" start throwing money around not knowing the history of trading, why .00, .5, .25, and .15/.85 levels are important, or looking at Time and Sales, let alone knowing what L1-L3 are. If there's any novice out there seeking real knowledge, literally just start by understanding the quarters in dollars and the whole figure amounts and why trades are pegged there.\n\nWill also give you insight to how orders \"flow,\" and why the patterns held in such high regard by technical analysts (aside from a few doji and patterns, it's all bullshit unless you're willing to get into the nitty gritty and learn the math behind Bollinger bands and moving averages (if that's the case my sub r/econometrics is very dense and more for college students, but it gives you and idea of the math behind TA).\n\nBut my main piece of advice is learn support resistance and move from there. Everyone Haas their own trading style and most trading styles suck and anyone selling you anything beyond support/resistance and learning order flow is selling you on some bullshit.\n\nWith that said, if a person wanting to enter trading is disciplined, doesn't see it as a primary source of income, AND realizes they will lose everything, then go for it. However, seems most people don't have that level of patience or grit to really get going with trading (most days market moves sideways and most of these \"gurus,\" don't know what to do then or how to extract alpha in such a situstion.). Good luck to anyone who read this.",

The article linked to a table where you could filter the top performers by gain and also filter it by year.\n\nAfter playing around for just a few minutes, I realized the manager that may have gotten huge returns in one year, got crappy returns the next year. The more you changed filters by gain and year, the more you realized no manager was consistently  performing all that well.\n\nThat proved to me that nobody knows nothing. It also supports the ongoing bet Warren Buffett has about hedge managers beating the S&amp;P 500, independent of fees.",

    "postText": "Never in my life have I thought I\u2019d open an account with Wells Fargo, but I did to take advantage of their $2500 Premier checking offer. I had to open the account in branch, and it was surprisingly smooth and pleasant. It also seems like the Premier checking account is almost fee-free (wire transfer, ATM withdrawal, etc.) other than the monthly maintenance fee, which is avoidable. I\u2019m linking my new WellsTrade account to it to invest the money instead of parking it in the checking account.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1) Is it safe to invest with Wells Fargo/WellsTrade? \n\nThe internet isn\u2019t very fond of WF in general, but I\u2019m mainly interested in the financial health of the company. I know it\u2019s one of the largest banks in the country, but people were even worried about Fidelity/Vanguard/Charles Schwab, so\u2026\n\n2) Is WMPXX safe to invest in? \n\nIt\u2019s a prime MMF owned/managed by Allspring/WF. I appreciate that its yield, 5.19%, is even higher than Vanguard\u2019s or Fidelity\u2019s MMFs, but am I risking my money with it? I see that it\u2019s an institutional fund and the assets it holds are huge. Just concerned due to the lack of info\u2014just like WellsTrade.\n\nAny insights are appreciated!\n\n*Cross-posted.",

            "comment": "Premier Checking has ways to waive the monthly service fee (MSF), so look into that, otherwise, $35/mo is pretty steep for banking account with some additional benefits.. which aren't even that great since some firms offer those similar benefits (top of my head, [Fidelity's Cash Account](https://www.fidelity.com/cash-management/fidelity-cash-management-account/overview)).\n\nTo your questions:\n\n1) There's a reason WF gets a lot of hate online.  It's just scandals after scandals with them.  That said, I can't see WF going anywhere.  Part of that \"too big to fail\" group (personal opinion).  The WellsTrade platform is *okay* when I used it a few years ago; decent enough for buy and hold investors.  They used to charge a ton of fees back then, but just quickly skimming their [fee schedule,](https://www.wellsfargo.com/investing/wellstrade-online-brokerage/pricing/) it looks like they're more competitively priced with the others.\n\n2) WMPXX is definitely more elusive on the info side, so I don't blame you for being skeptical.  Some quick search seems to yield this [Monthly Fact Sheet](https://www.allspringglobal.com/globalassets/assets/edocs/fact-sheet/money-market-fund/money-market-fund-prm.pdf) (required disclosures by all mutual funds, including money markets).  Quick glance, it seems to be weighted more heavily into [commercial papers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialpaper.asp), making up about 42% of the portfolio.  Thus, the slightly higher yield vs some other firms' common money market funds (Fidelity's [SPAXX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/composition/31617H102) and Vanguard's [VMFXX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vmfxx#portfolio-composition)).  In short, slightly more risk for slightly more yield (no such thing as a free lunch).",

                    "comment": "Thank you for the detailed reply. \n\nMy monthly fee will be waived, so the account will basically be fee-free. I was actually surprised by how many fees they waived for the Premier checking account (which makes sense considering the amount they require for waiving the MSF). I have Fidelity\u2019s CMA, and I agree that it\u2019s a great account model. It turns out that WellsTrade is actually very similar to Fidelity\u2019s CMA albeit no MMF auto-liquidation function. \n\nTo sum up, WMPXX is riskier than common MMFs only because it\u2019s a prime MMF vs government MMF, not because it\u2019s from WF/Allspring, correct? So, compared to other prime MMFs, like SPRXX or FZDXX, there\u2019s the same amount of risk. \n\nThat\u2019s how I felt about WF\u2014too big to fail. But hearing people talk about them as if they should never be trusted with any money made me concerned.",

But hearing people talk about them as if they should never be trusted with any money made me concerned.\n\nBetween unauthorized accounts being opened without customers' consent to auto loans being repossessed even though the borrowers were making payments on-time, are just a few of the many failures of the WF's internal systems and its leadership.  I personally only use them for convenience's sake since they have enough branches around my local area (though, more and more branches have started closing).  But I personally wouldn't trust them (and, honestly, any of the \"big banks\") beyond that because I worked there for close to a decade and have only seen it get progressively worse.",

I wouldn't worry about WF or its brokerage side going under as there's protection in place for that (FDIC for bank accounts and SIPC for brokerage). And, of course, the \"big boys\" of either world would be happy to scoop in and save a failing institution to increase their customer base (JP Morgan bailing out First Republic Bank earlier this year, as one example). And should either REALLY fail, well, then I think we have much bigger issues to worry about at that point. \n\n&gt;As long as they don\u2019t do funny things with clients\u2019 money, making me not able to access it or lose it altogether, I think I\u2019ll be good.

Just be watchful of your own accounts, which, honestly, EVERYONE should be, regardless of their financial institution of choice.",

    "postText": "I went to treasurydirect and submitted a 4-week T-bill. \n\nAuction date: 6-8-23\n\nIssue date: 6-13-23\n\nDoes this meant that they will draft my funds from my bank (4.15% APY) and then won't being the T-bill until 6-13...resulting in 5 days without interest accruing?   \n\n\nIf this is true, then is there a downtime between the next T-bill if I signed up for auto-continuing? And also a downtime when finally transferring back to my bank?",

For example, I invested some of my less liquid emergency fund (for being laid off or for tax bills etc) in 4 week treasuries, set reinvestment to maximum allowed periods. Now I just get interest payments every month in my checking account. \n\nHad an unexpectedly big tax bill a few months ago and was able to cancel the reinvestment easily had the money in my account by the end of the month. \n\nHowever you can\u2019t partly reinvest, so it might make sense to have separate tranches of 4 week treasuries that are staggered.",

    "postText": "Been seeing a lot of users posting DD on Alibaba and making a bullish case for it. Seems like the massive drop in share price now should be a fantastic opportunity to pick up the Amazon of China at only a forward P/E of 18 right? Not exactly.\n\nThis has been posted before in less detail, but I think it's important to remind investors of the current circumstances arising during the anti-trust probe with China.\n\nThe reason why BABA is nose-diving on any extra news of government involvement is that BABA represents ownership of a shell company in the cayman islands, not actually Alibaba itself. The shell company doesn't even have ownership of Alibaba's equity. If you want proof of this, simply open up any of their financial statements filed with the SEC.\n\nChinese law forbids foreigners from owning strategic assets in the country, and Alibaba wouldn\u2019t be able to keep its licenses if, say, a U.S. hedge fund directly bought into the company.  Basically, the Alibaba stock will buy you a stake in a Cayman Islands-registered entity that is under contract to receive the profit from Alibaba's Chinese assets but will not actually own them. This structure is called a VIE.\n\nSo think about this, if Chinese laws prohibit foreigners from owning/investing in these kinds of assets in China, what would protect the shell company in the Caymans from enforcing their contract to receive profits from Alibaba if shit hit the fan with the CCP? If Alibaba gets broken up during anti-trust probes, how do we know which subsidiaries BABA ( the shell company in the caymans) will be contractually obligated to receive profits from? Heck, is this contract to receive profits even enforceable in China, where the law clearly states foreigners can't own strategic investments?\n\nIs this VIE structure even legal in China? Beijing has never acknowledged the legality. According to Harris Bricken, an international law firm:\n\n\" VIEs are illegal. We disagree with those who are saying that what is proposed is a two tier, foreign/Chinese\u00a0system. \"\n\nWe don't know the true answers to the above questions. BABA could easily be worth 0$ if investors one day decide that the \"contract\" to receive profits from Alibaba is basically BS.\n\nAlibaba and Chinese executives come out a winner either way. Alibaba was able to raise billions from foreign investors without giving up a single bit of ownership.\n\nOh, by the way, all Chinese listed companies on US exchanges are listed as Cayman shell companies, this isn't specific to Alibaba. Baidu and JD are set up the same way.\n\nEDITS:\n\n1. Since many of you are asking, yes NIO is also set up this way. When I said all Chinese companies are listed this way, I literally mean 100%.\n2. I don't know why so many high-profile investors still buy these ADR's. My favourite value investor, Bill Miller, also holds a huge position in BABA. I guess you're either in the camp that believes China won't enforce their own laws on foreign ownership so BABA's VIE is undervalued, or that one day they will and so the intrinsic value of BABA's VIE is 0$ because profits can never legally flow to foreign investors.\n3. The SEC just last month in a report published in November expressed serious concerns: \"These China-based Issuer VIE structures pose risks to U.S. investors that are not present in other organizational structures. For example, exerting control through contractual arrangements may be less effective than direct equity ownership, and a company may incur substantial costs to enforce the terms of the arrangements, including those relating to the distribution of funds among the entities. Further, the Chinese government could determine that the agreements establishing the VIE structure do not comply with Chinese law and regulations, including those related to restrictions on foreign ownership, which could subject a China-based Issuer to penalties, revocation of business and operating licenses, or forfeiture of ownership interests. \" Source: [https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/disclosure-considerations-china-based-issuers](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/disclosure-considerations-china-based-issuers)\n4. After some further research, Mainland Chinese companies listed on the HKE are also VIE's and considered \"offshore\".  Here is what the org structure looks like: [https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/12/21/7b58a856-4294-11eb-be63-b2d34bb06b66\\_972x\\_163317.jpg](https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/12/21/7b58a856-4294-11eb-be63-b2d34bb06b66_972x_163317.jpg)",

Most large US ETF issuers are QFIIs in China and can hold A-shares. Vanguard for example:\n\n&gt;Goal is to closely track the return of the FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Index.\n\nhttps://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VWO\n\nBlackRock (iShares), State Street (SPDR), Invesco and Fidelity are also QFIIs, as are most major US investment banks, entities like the Singapore Sovereign Wealth Fund, the Ontario Pension fund, several US Ivy League universities and even the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. These can all own Chinese shares directly. It's not a *very* long list of entities that are allowed do this, but it's [around 300 large institutions globally.](http://www.csrc.gov.cn/pub/csrc_en/OpeningUp/RelatedLists/QFIIs/201912/t20191223_368109.html\n) Schwab is not and Schwab ETFs don't hold Chinese A-shares.\n\nSo no, if they are a QFII holding A-shares they do not own in the same way as a foreign individual investor.",

            "comment": "&gt;The reason why BABA is nose-diving on any extra news of government involvement is that BABA represents ownership of a shell company in the cayman islands, not actually Alibaba itself. The shell company doesn't even have ownership of Alibaba's equity. If you want proof of this, simply open up any of their financial statements filed with the SEC.\n\nThis is an incredibly bizarre analysis on what happened.\n\nThe CCP investigating Baba for monopolistic practices. This means two things:\n\n* Baba will likely have to make changes in their business practices that would lead to a change in their future valuation. Specifically, not strong arming vendors to list their products on only Baba. This means their competitors JD and PDD will likely be able to grow more. This will affect long term value of BABA.\n* Secondly, this also means they are under scrutiny and will be careful in future businesses and will have to be really careful in those and will likely constrain their growth. This will affect the long term value of BABA.\n\nIt has absolutely nothing to do with what the reason you gave. This is why the price tanked in both Hong Kong and New York exchanges.\n\nBlackrock has a full 1 % of their portfolio in BABA ( 27 billion out of 2.7 trillion).\n\nBallie Gilford has a whopping 5 percent of their entire portfolio in BABA. Even in the face of delisting fears, Ballie shifted just 20% to Hong Kong listing .\n\nPrice T Rowe has 2 percent.\n\nVanguard has 0.5% of theirs in BABA.\n\nMorgan Stanley and JP Morgan each have 1% of their portfolios in BABA.\n\nUBS 3 %.\n\nHSBC 10%.\n\nCanada's Pension Plan 10%.\n\nMagellan 12%.\n\nThese are the biggest funds and money managers in North America and they are balls deep in BABA. These people are not idiots. You haven't uncovered some technicality that the thousands of people working at these places don't know about. This is one of the most profitable companies in the world, not some shady bodega in the Bronx.",

The inability for foreigners to buy into their stocks (unless they jump through a ton of red tape) also no doubt hurts their value.\n\nI'd much rather invest in US companies I actually know and can do DD about by using their products/services or visiting their stores.

I would rather invest in an American company.   \n\n\nAt least at some level there are some sort of guidelines. It's similar to buying groceries. I prefer purchasing grown in America or Canada products (veggies and fruit). The laws governing pesticides and agriculture differ in non American countries, so there is greater protection for the consumer (certain pesticides are banned from usage). Non sequitur.. but ultimately which government do you trust to have rules to protect the average retail consumer?  \n\n\nInteresting side note. I know bitcoin is going up like crazy this year. The largest Canadian bitcoin exchange was a ponzi scheme and the the people who used that exchange when it collapsed, did not get anything close to what they lost in bitcoins. It can tell you that when things go south, how extremely badly one's investments can be stolen.\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/05/tech/quadriga-gerald-cotten-cryptocurrency/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/05/tech/quadriga-gerald-cotten-cryptocurrency/index.html)\n\nImagine a Chinese company who is trading in North America... but it doesn't give you actual shares in the company.

            "comment": "&gt;I don't know why so many high-profile investors still buy these ADR's. My favourite value investor, Bill Miller, also holds a huge position in BABA. I guess you're either in the camp that believes China won't enforce their own laws on foreign ownership so BABA's VIE is undervalued, or that one day they will and so the intrinsic value of BABA's VIE is 0$ because profits can never legally flow to foreign investors.\n\nFor a second I thought you were going to admit that others may know more about the subject than you do, but then you went the other direction. BABA is not only held by redditors, it trades millions of shares per day and has for several years. This subject is not new and it hasn't stopped anything. And it has nothing to do with what happened this week.\n\nThis setup has been used by Chinese companies since 2000. A complete ban on the Chinese VIE structure means Chinese companies will no longer have access to foreign capital, which is bad for China.\n\nCould it happen one day? Possible. Not certain. And every risk has a price. You'd surely buy Alibaba at $1 per share if I offered that to you privately.\n\nThe bigger worry I have with Alibaba is lack of accounting standards, not China suddenly severing itself from the global economy.",

That, and the inability to demand my \"rights\", should things go wrong, or enforcing any judgments against Chinese entities by a foreign court being well nigh impossible inside China, or suing for \"my rights\" in China. \n\nI have long questioned why Chinese shell companies have been allowed to trade on bourses outside China but ultimately it is up to the investors to know what they are doing &amp; what they get in exchange for their money. \n\nCaveat emptor.",

The CCP has no interest in bringing down their biggest tech giant. There's tons of upside still left in BABA. I wouldn't be surprised if they move into Africa also as part of China's silk road economic plan. \n\nOverall I think too many people on this subreddit fall into the trap of overthinking things and trying to be the smartest person in the room, this post is a perfect example.",

Very important information.\n\nHowever, imho, this post leaves out a critical bit of information and as a result also comes across as informative with a touch of fear-mongering.\n\nMost savvy investors, and there are many massive funds invested in China, feel mostly confident about the ADR's they've bought into for a simple reason: China's success is tied at the hip to Western economies. There is seemingly no way around that in the near future or even decades to come. Africa and Latin America will not become the consumers of Chinese goods that Europe, Australia, Japan, USA and others are any time soon.\n\nFurthermore, many emerging nations who are currently defecting from Western support to leaning on Chinese financing can revert at any time for many reasons.\n\nEssentially, despite the rhetoric at this point China can no more nationalize and turn inward then can the USA without risking its entire economic success story. Sure, it has a 1.2billion person market internally. But most are still poor by Western standards and will begin to get poorer if China regresses rather than continues to open up to the world as they have been.\n\nIn summary, while China ADR's are not as safe as US listings (nobody questioning that), it would be utterly self-defeating and self-destructive for China to burn the international investor in such a ruthless manner and set them back decades if they did.",

Don't forget that Alibaba in particular is one of their flagship companies.\n\nWhat's happening here is the CCP making a statement after Jack Ma had a loose mouth. Play with us or we'll destroy you. In the end there'll be some secret agreement between Alibaba leadership and the CCP, they'll get some fine and that's it.",

That\u2019d be suicide when it comes to any Chinese companies acquiring foreign capital ever again. The downside far, far outweighs the upside for CCP. Their goal is world domination. They\u2019ve, in a decade, gone from no legitimate international corporations to several behemoths.",

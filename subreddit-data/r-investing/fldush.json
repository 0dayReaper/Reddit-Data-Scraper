Set a price between current prices and the peak price. To avoid the negatives of this form of nationalizing, require that permanent board seats afforded by the shares purchased are held by labor at the company and that all executive compensation and downsizing must be a unanimous decision of the board.  Once the share price exceeds the purchase price, the government will slowly sell its shares on the open market. And the company will be barred from ever doing stock buybacks again.",

They would probably leverage the hell out of the company so they could squeeze one last great quarter, regardless of what it would to the companies ability to handle a stressful event.

He can cancel pay increases if he feels it is unfair. A lot of bankers got bonuses because that is how bankers are paid. If bonuses are cancelled that would be well more than a 50% pay cut and everybody would quit and they can't hire anybody ever again. Bonuses were very bad optics. But the banks had to surrender control of compensation when they took the bailout money and did not regain control until they paid it back.",

The wealthy obviously but also retirees living off their 401k or people on the verge of retirement. If they remain in the workforce too long or others have to go back to work it can negatively effect the economy as younger people will then have a more difficult time getting jobs, or fair paying jobs. We have already seen that happen before, and as young people are having a tough time already i have no idea what the longer term effects would be.",

Trump can actually win a very large number of people over to his re-election if he can handle this crisis correctly and puts his preference for crony capitalism aside for a few months.\n\nI also approve of how he talked past our lumbering FDA today and talked up chloroquine. He also invoked the Defense Production act yesterday, to make masks &amp; other supplies and hospital ships available for this crisis. We're also going to face massive shortages of drugs like chloroquine, for which we don't have a national supply, and the Defense Production Act could mobilize the production of it.\n\nIf he manages to get things right and not look corrupt in this crisis, Trump could create a legacy for his presidential record and get re-elected, with just a few weeks' worth of work. This coronavirus and its impact cuts across party lines and that means that he can turn his approval around with practically anyone.\n\nI can't believe I'm saying this, but if he serves us well, I'd vote to re-elect him.",

The government passed a law in 1934 allowing the SEC greater inspections into these purchases, essentially stopping stock buybacks. This meant the majority of profits went to workers and the company, with a bit of it used for issuing dividends. When Reagan came into power, he appointed John Shaad, who repealed the law in 1982. Now, a lot publicly trading companies spend almost all of their profits on stock buybacks. It doesnt matter if the company is doing badly behind the scenes, if they can raise the stock price, upper management can get their bonuses. \n\n[It is Vox, so there may be some left-leaning bias, but here's an interesting video cover this very topic and where I've gotten my info from](https://youtu.be/ylLTMYt24lA)",

Then pension funds, 401ks, etc. Aren't fucked and we can return to normal when the situation passes.  Or we could just destroy a ton of value out of spite.  That seems like the best strategy in times like this.\n\nSeriously, why do people whine about buybacks so much, but clearly have no issue with dividends?  Their share prices arguably weren't high before a giant black swan liquidity crisis that nobody could have predicted just 4 months ago.",

Most small business restaurants aren't competing with Apple bees unless its a shit restaurant. Even small pizzerias aren't competing with Dominos or Pizza hut simply because their styles are unable to be replicated by these massive chains.

You can go get a payday loan, pawn off your belongings, rack up credit card debt, and whatever else you need to do to survive. This is how the a free market economy is supposed to work.\u201d\n\nYeah they COULD do that. But what is the point of letting people/companies go bankrupt if you can provide a little bit of cushion to ease the impact to the economy? I don\u2019t see how it wouldn\u2019t be a significant net positive, especially considering that the government profited off of TARP in 2008. Even if one of those airlines goes bankrupt, that\u2019s a huge amount of people that you\u2019re going to throw into unemployment and who will eventually start collecting unemployment benefits. And what airline is out there hiring additional employees in the mass right now? I don\u2019t think there is any reason to not throw any airline, oil company, or aerospace manufacturer a life raft in this situation. Yeah they may of mismanaged their funds in the prior years, and I understand people\u2019s hesitation to bail a company out that acted irresponsibly. But I don\u2019t see how the ripple effects that will happen to the economy as a result of not bailing them out aren\u2019t worth preventing.",

Your job is to deliver value to your shareholders. You find yourself in a situation where markets broadly are down, but the crisis putting everyone in \"risk off\" mode doesn't impact your company.  From the opinions of you, your board of directors, and your financial analysts, your company is *very* undervalued in the market currently.  In addition, due to a lack of appealing new projects to invest in, your company is, at the moment, quite cash rich.  So how do you best deliver value to your investors and make use of that cash?\n\n\n1.  You could start paying dividends.  This can work, but there are downsides.  It forces a taxable event in all your investors.  In addition, dividends often come with the expectation that they will continue, and you don't necessarily think that this cash rich, no projects situation will continue.\n\n\n2.  You could invest in new projects.  Generally this is exactly what shareholders want you doing, but for one reason or another, there aren't a lot of good RoI projects available at the moment.\n\n\n3.  You could pay down debt.  Appealing if you're extremely over leveraged, but if your debt is super cheap, AND a tax deduction what shareholder is going to be happy you made it go away?\n\n\n4.  You can buy back shares.  You feel your stock is undervalued, so you'd get a great RoI on the buyback.  It only creates a taxable event for those shareholders who opt to participate in the tender.  It drives up your stock price and doesn't imply any future payments, because this time next year you might very well want to put that cash in to projects.",

Levering up your company to buy shares is a Hell of a gamble, but it's also hard *not* to when the government makes borrowing damn near free. For some firms it'll pay off big, for some it'll sink them.  As for the \"landscape,\" the popularity of buybacks really highlights just how bleh the economic landscape has been, and how much stock returns were held up by cheap money.\n\n&gt; How do you feel about the idea surrounding share buybacks being \"stock manipulation\"?\n\nIt's an utter falsehood, silliness with a political agenda from people who don't understand how equity markets actually work.\n\n&gt; Do you feel poor use of these buybacks should be reprimanded?\n\nIt should be reprimanded by stockholders, in the form of a lower stock price due to higher risk on the company's balance sheet.",

It would then allow the public to benefit from future turnaround and profit and have some votes to say in future direction of the Company once things recover.\nIs it because they would then have to issue net new shares and dilute the value of existing ones further?",

For the last decade or so, many of these corporations have been using their obscene profits (Trump tax cuts) to buy back stock, enriching shareholders and CEOs in the process.  Bail out the companies, but make sure the shareholders walk away with ZEERO.  Or, better yet, let them reorganize in Bankruptcy.  Chapter 11.  Distribute any proceeds to the US Treasury.",

    "postText": "So my company offers a 20% discount for share purchases, and they allow us to buy using up to ~25% of our 2023 salary. This is a big company that has historically reliable returns. Lockup period is 5 years barring life events (divorce, home purchase, etc). Is there any reason why I shouldn't contribute the full 25% of my salary to purchasing their stock? Wife is more conservative and says we shouldn't commit that much.\n\n\nWe plan on purchasing a house in a few years, so to me it just seems like a free extra 20% for the down payment we will make at that time. Any thoughts?\n\n\nSince I'm getting a lot of comments on the long lockup period, it's because the company is based in France and subject to French law. I guess they have a thing where ESPPs need to wait a minimum a 5 years before sale. American law allows an earlier sale due to certain events.",

I've seen companies offer large stock options or 401K matches with long holding periods but not ESPPs. \n\nIf that's true and if you reasonably believe that you can withdraw it more often, then it's up to you. \n\nMy number one recommendation for anyone asking is to avoid investing in your company. Your salary is already dependent on their survival; investing your funds in them would be putting all your eggs in one basket. But ESPPs are usually different. \n\nNormally, I'd be all over the 20% discount since it's basically a 6.25% raise. But five years is a pretty long holding period. The usual lockup period is between 0 days and 6 months. Five years gives you a lot of time to lose money and increases the concentration risk you already face from working at your company. \n\nI didn't even know a lockup period that long was legal. You might want to talk with a few coworkers and complain about it to the appropriate HR rep. Maybe if enough employees do, they might choose to reduce it to something more appropriate.",

Do they have quarterly purchases and resets (sometimes referred to as a \u201cCadillac Plan\u201d)?\n\nESPPs are usually good deals, but this one probably isn\u2019t. A 5-year lockup with only a couple of events triggering a withdrawal (which, it sounds like, would only be for contributions and not for actual purchases) takes away a lot of flexibility. Further, while the discount gives you a 25% return, over 5 years, you\u2019re only getting a 4.6% APY, which is hardly better than a savings account right now. That\u2019s assuming your plan is a look-back plan where you\u2019re guaranteed a return.",

It\u2019ll pass pretty quickly. However, you know best whether this company is a good company to own or not. \n\nLet me put it this way: if you were buying shares through your broker, would you buy this company?  If the answer is yes, there you go. \n\nNotice I didn\u2019t consider the 20% discount in that calculation. This is because the five year lockup and the 20% discount both cancel each other out from a risk perspective. \n\nOver the next five years, there\u2019s the possibility that the company could do smashingly well, or could stay the same, or could lose 20% of its value. In all of these scenarios you are OK. There\u2019s also the possibility that it loses more than 20% of its value in which case you are losing money. \n\nI think the 20% discount is a reasonable risk reduction given the five year lockup. Therefore the only question is \u201cdo I believe in this company?\u201d\n\nAs to \u201chow much should I invest\u201d, again note that the 20% discount is not a factor. The answer to this question is also the answer to \u201chow much money can I live without\u201d.",

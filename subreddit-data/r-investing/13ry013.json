            "comment": "I've spent a lot of time in the robo advising space and here's a brief analysis of some of the top players in the space:\r  \n\r  \nBetterment: Betterment provides personalized investment portfolios based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Betterment offers features such as tax-efficient investing and goal-based planning. Betterment is a great option, but behind the scenes they tend to just use one of the many Vanguard Thematic portfolios (which are also offered to employees at large organizations like Deloitte, etc)\r  \nAs someone who's spent the majority of their career in the portfolio management space, I can say that these portfolios are the epitome of \"cookie cutter,\" and don't really offer much difference than investing in indexes/etfs (in fact, you're statistically better off just doing that)\r  \n\r  \nWealthfront: Wealthfront is another prominent robo-advisor that provides automated investment solutions. It offers features like tax-loss harvesting, direct indexing, and cash management services. Wealthfront aims to provide low-cost, diversified portfolios tailored to individual investors.\r  \nWealthfront is among the best in the space and seem to allocate more oversight to the portfolios they offer to clients. I could be wrong here, but all of the data I have at my disposal shows that Wealthfront tends to be slightly less correlated with the \"cookie cutter\" portfolios that are offered by many in the space, leading me to think highly of them.\r  \n\r  \nVanguard Personal Advisor Services: Vanguard is known for its index funds, and its Personal Advisor Services combines human advice with digital tools. It provides access to financial advisors who can offer personalized investment guidance.\r  \nThis could be a controversial opinion, but again - as someone who's spent the majority of their career in this space, I think Vanguard is overrated.\r  \nThey've built themselves into essentially a Gucci of investment management - their name carries all the weight - not their portfolio returns.\r  \nThey do, however, allocate significantly more time to HNWIs and large institutions (as you'll find with many players in the space)\r  \n\r  \nSchwab Intelligent Portfolios: Schwab is a well-established financial institution that offers its robo-advisor platform called Schwab Intelligent Portfolios. Schwab Intelligent Portfolios offers a wide range of investment options, including ETFs from various asset classes.\r  \nI think Schwab is in the top 5, but still - all of the data I've seen shows that you might just be better off investing in ETFs yourself.\r  \n\r  \nSurmount AI: Surmount is still a startup, but I'm very excited about what they're doing. As I understand, they're the only company in the space that's been backed by Renaissance Technologies - which is massive.\r  \nI've been a user of Surmount for just a couple of months but am already very impressed with their platform.\r  \nThey're the first robo advisor I've seen that doesn't just throw you into a cookie cutter portfolio. Instead, they provide a lot of insights around each strategy, enable the user to make their decisions for themselves based on risk tolerance &amp; aggression threshold, and have a wide range of strategies. From thematic, to dollar cost averaging, to even algotrading. I'm extremely impressed with this platform and think they'll likely end up being among the leaders in the space. It's a breath of fresh air to me in the robo advising space.\r  \nI've only been using the platform for a short time period, but so far my Surmount portfolio is outperforming my 3 others. Furthermore, I think the best feature they have is the ability to link any of your existing portfolios and automate them in one place. The level of freedom this platform provides is extremely impressive.\r  \n\r  \nTD Ameritrade Essential Portfolios: TD Ameritrade offers its robo-advisor service called Essential Portfolios. It provides automated portfolio management and offers a variety of pre-built portfolios based on different risk profiles. TD Ameritrade also offers access to human advisors for additional support.\r  \nTDA would be in the top 3 for me, but I still find that they use a lot of cookie cutter portfolios. However, they do not seem to all be Vanguard portfolios, which is promising.",

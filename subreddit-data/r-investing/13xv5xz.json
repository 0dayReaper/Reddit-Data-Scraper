    "postText": "I am trying to understand the 30-day SEC Yield, which I thought was fairly straightforward.\n\nI am looking at ICSH as an example, which seems like it should be a simple one. The 52-week price range is 49.84-50.31, so fluctuation is relatively negligible. There are regular monthly distributions. The 30-day SEC Yield (as of May 31, 2023) is 5.01%. The last monthly distribution was $0.176388. The lowest price in the last month was $50.12, so let's use that as the most optimistic denominator. 0.176388 / 50.12 \\* 12 is 4.22%. If it's accounting for the next distribution which is higher at $0.185586, it is still only 4.44%. Why is the discrepancy so big (5.01 vs 4.22)? What am I missing?",

            "comment": "Unfortunately, Distribution Yields can be very different from SEC Yields. See Vanguard article below. I prefer using the WisdomTree USFR EFT where the distribution yield and SEC yields have been nearly identical. Much easier to understand.\n\n[https://advisors.vanguard.com/insights/article/Unpackthechallengesofrisingbondfundyields](https://advisors.vanguard.com/insights/article/Unpackthechallengesofrisingbondfundyields)",

Maybe I missed this point, but why is the SEC yield so important as a standalone metric (if you are buying the fund, you are not holding the individual assets)?",

If a bond fund distributes 1% with a sec yield of 5% that tells you they are reinvesting 4% themselves.  If your objective is to have a bond fund that reinvests most of there interest payments then you can directly compare the SEC yield to other funds/bonds that may distribute in different ways",

So your 30 day yield is kinda how you should think about investment income for the entire coming year like APY, I think it's daily too\n\nLike hey if everything stayed the same and writeoffs and recievales are handed correctly this % is steady income stream.\n\nAnd they broke down all their issues, collateralized debt, bonds and notes, two credit lines...\nInsurance products include like annuities or perpetuity instruments like bonds with unlimited life.\n\nPrivate credit firms include portfolio exits into their yield, but for this firm its probably something liquid or laddered. In case of any event that claims payable beyond float, it needs to be incurred or paid out.\n\nBerkshire hathway is one of the most readable and easy company to understand. If you read the reports and follow with his letters since he started, it's a mini executive masterclass on insurance, and he explains accounting so perfectly. My accounting got so much more comfortable following around Berkshire and its Chairman - as you watch a company operate only through financials over decades, you can now read this language instead of relying on \"bad translators\" that quite frankly come from people who know even less than than those seeking their opinion.\n\nProgressive is also a wonderful company (as an owner not customer. woo capitalism).

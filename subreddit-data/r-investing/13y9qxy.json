    "postText": "The first stock was HIMS and this stock was not good enough for him. I made 40% so far. His logic applied well by focus on the subscriber model.  \n\nThe other one was VXTR. While the logic of buy remains to be untested, the stock fell like a rock and the auditor retreated from Canada. Whatever the stock is now so cheap I'm considering to throw more money on the stock, since ceo and cfo talking about lot more customers   \n\nAnyway all these experts on stocks working with a minimum amount of information, which makes investments into such companies to a big gamble. His failure on a Swiss company with a crypto email service looked to me like a problem in the first second, since the used algorithms were proprietary, which isn't acceptable for any organized company. Mariusz showed at this point, he is a bloody amateur as well. \n\nWhich \"expert\" has really insight? Are there some for common people?",

    "postText": "https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2024.html\n\nNvidia reported first-quarter earnings for its fiscal 2024 on Wednesday, with a stronger-than-expected forecast that drove shares up 26% in extended trading.\n\nHere's how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates for the quarter ended in April:\n\nEPS: $1.09, adjusted, versus 92 cents expected\nRevenue: $7.19 billion, versus $6.52 billion expected\nNvidia said it expected sales of about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the current quarter, more than 50% higher than Wall Street estimates of $7.15 billion.\n\nPrior to the after-hours move, Nvidia stock was up 109% so far in 2023, mostly driven by optimism stemming from the company's leading position in the market for artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was seeing \"surging demand\" for its data center products.\n\nNvidia's data center group reported $4.28 billion in sales, versus expectations of $3.9 billion, a 14% annual increase. Nvidia said that performance was driven by demand for its GPU chips from cloud vendors as well as large consumer internet companies, which use Nvidia chips to train and deploy generative AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nNvidia's strong performance in data center shows that AI chips are becoming increasingly important for cloud providers and other companies that run large numbers of servers.\n\nHowever, Nvidia's gaming division, which includes the company's graphics cards for PC sales, reported a 38% drop in revenue to $2.24 billion in sales versus expectations of $1.98 billion. Nvidia blamed the decline on a slower macroeconomic environment as well as the ramp up of the company's latest GPUs for gaming.\n\nNvidia's automotive division, including chips and software to develop self-driving cars, grew 114% year over year, but remains small at under $300 million in sales for the quarter.\n\nNet income for the quarter was $2.04 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $1.62 billion, or 64 cents, during the year-earlier period. Nvidia's overall sales fell 13% from $8.29 billion a year ago.\n\n*Personal take*: I don\u2019t even know what to say, this is simply astonishing. The AFH price puts NVDA at 20% above its previous ATH. This jump would have been insane even for 2021, let alone the tech market of 2023.\n\nAI will be the main focus and the main buzzword for the entire tech industry for the next few years, and I expect many companies to pivot toward that one way or another (even if it\u2019s just paying PR lip service) in order to catch the wind in the sail.",

At scale, some of these large LLMs (a form of AI) are showing promise. Look at ChatGPT, Adobe Firefly, Stable Diffusion.\n\nNow if you wanna do meaningful RnD in this space, you need to have supercomputers that allow you to do this in a feasible amount of time. For context, ChatGPT training took months on 1000s of Nvidia A100 (last gen chip). H100 (latest chip by Nvidia) is much better and all companies wanna get it so that they can compete with other companies. Basically, the shovels for this metaphorical gold rush practically run on Nvidia\u2019s hardware and software stack so the demand is huge, Nvidia knows it and they are selling their hardware at a huge margin accordingly.\n\nThis is just one of the usecases. There are a couple more you can read about in any decent analysis of the stock.",

None of this is even close to technical analysis on the Chip, AI, or what would create demand for this chip.\n\nIf Google get more qbits in their quantum computer how long until these chips become obsolete?\n\nWhat tells us LLMs are here to stay? In technical terms, LLMs are some of the \u201cweakest\u201d forms of AI. Why are we assuming that the worst kind of a product we have is a good investment long term?\n\nReading about a stock doesn\u2019t give you much valuable information.

Meta, Microsoft, and their ilk were intent on convincing everyone that metaverse was the next big thing, whereas the broad consumer response was \"who is this for and why would anyone want this?\" from what I recall. \n\nSame thing with NFTs. Consumers didn't seem to care about the underlying technology, just the fact that they could sell a link to a picture of a monkey for six figures. People pretty much called its collapse from Day 1. \n\nThat doesn't seem to be the case with generative AI. Just in the last few months, numerous people I know have integrated it into their workflows. I was on a plane the other day and the person next to me spent the whole trip rewriting their company's marketing material using ChatGPT. Some companies are starting to use AI image generation instead of human models for ads. If anything, many of the arguments people are making against generative AI is that it'll be *too disruptive.*",

Why aren't they doing anything about the software part then?\n\nThe raw 3D rendering hardware for video games is identical, but AMD consistently has a better price for it.\n\nIt's the extra add-ons that Nvidia beats AMD with. Better Ray Tracing cores. Better video encoding cores. Better AI cores. Better upscaling cores.\n\nBut, the AI bit is mostly a software issue is my understanding. It's not that AMD can't do it, it's that it's easier to setup on Nvidia. Last decade, AMD's gaming software was trash compared to Nvidia. Well, today AMD's gaming software is actually a bit better than Nvidia's. This decade, AMD's ai software is trash compared to Nvidia, but I expect them to fix that in 2-5 years.\n\nNvidia has a several year head start, but there isn't much protecting their lead position. Itel's and AMD's GPUs will catch up before the end of the decade.",

And yet you actually believe they\u2019ll achieve 30 PE by 2025 lmao? \n\nThere\u2019s absolutely zero validation of this being nothing more than short term boom in demand. It can and easily will go away after a year or so. You think google amazon etc will order another 10000 AI GPUs after they already have an initial inventory of GPUs built up for whatever AI product they aim to build up?",

Next quarter guidance is the norm.\n\nThey guided to 11bn revenue @ 69% margin - that's 7.59bn gross profit. subtract taxes and operating expenses and that's 4.1bn in net income by *next quarter*\n\nIf they achieve 11bn + higher revenue each quarter due to growth, they could be looking at 45-50bn in revenue for the year\n\nDo the math. That means their net income for the year is approaching 20bn.\n\nThen in 2024 if they grow another 50%, that's already PE &lt;35.",

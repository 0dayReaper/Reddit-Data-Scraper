    "postText": "What is the best money market interest rate? I have vanguard and schwab. I think I would prefer vanguard as expenses are lower? Am i seeing this correctly that vmfxx and vusxx are paying 5% annually?\n\nI would like a place short term to medium term to park this money and feel 5% is a deal! Any other suggestions that you all have? \n\nShould I DCA that cash into vti/voo? Market seems to be relatively steady but my gut tells me to slowly add instead of lump sum.\n\nThanks for any input!",

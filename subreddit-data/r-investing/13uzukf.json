Which companies are traded on the stock market and could benefit from legalization? Which big players are there in the Netherlands that could spread their business to Germany quite quickly?",

Think of it as a sort of urban gardening club, only that they grow and sell cannabis.\nNot much room for big business to f*CK things up. And I think that's part of the reasoning behind the legislation.\n\nI would not invest a single penny in firms that claim to be on the German cannabis market.",

Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  \n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  \n* What are you current holdings?

United States. \n\n- Yes. 52k right now. Expected to go up to 70k and beyond. \n\n- No real objectives. House may be in the future or a new car, but neither have a set date beyond 'not soon'. So,'retirement' is my only goal. \n\n- time horizon can be decades until I have a big cost coming up like a house.\n\n- I've heard that those with time can afford the higher risk. So, I may be interested in a bit of higher risk. \n\n- I have a 401k from my last company. The current company won't let me open a 401k with them till this time next year. I've currently done nothing to it as I'm not sure what I should do with it yet. \n\n- only debt I have is credit card and money I owe to my brother. Both will be cleared in about 2 months. \n\nMy question is this: I'm currently trying to set up a financial plan to follow once I recover from unemployment. So far, it has been I save up 5k as an emergency fund first, then I open up a roth and invest all my spare funds into this until I max out the yearly input. Then, begin investing my excess funds into an Index Fund to maybe get some increases to my money provided I can withdraw anytime in case of large and unexpected expenses. \n\nHonestly, I'm not sure how much I should value the Roth and Index over my own savings account (i.e. investing all my spare funds into items that may backfire). Or even if this is a good plan to begin with. I have some serious gaps in my information due to inexperience and could use someone with said experience to give me at least pointers on how this plan will work out?",

I don't have a partner in my life, and I know I can't afford an investment like that even with a possible 70k salary. Can't confirm nor deny a possible business venture at this point. Don't see something I can pursue with what I know/can do that would be a return investment there yet, but the possibility does exist. \n\nThe only loose end is a house. I'm very comfortable living an apartment lifestyle and can easily support a partner in my life this way (with their income, of course). I'm not completely sure I can continue that lifestyle with kids, but it's still doable. Honestly, though, if I have to live paying rent to an apartment for the rest of my days, I'd be fine with that. And if a kid is involved, I could look into a three bedroom apartment, I guess?\n\nSo, to answer your suggestion, I think I can deliberately do both a Roth and save. I'm in no financial issue to say that i can't invest into a Roth until i hit the max, but adding an IF is a bit much. Continuously saving into my savings account seems to be the better call. Though, wouldn't I get better returns from my IF if I can still withdraw at any time?",

Buy highly diversified, broad market, low management expense index funds. See /r/bogleheads.\n\nThe short book by John Bogle, \"The Little Book of Common Sense Investing\" explains the theory.\n\nThe first thing to do is get your financial house in order. Not indicated. You may have these things covered.\n\nHave a financial plan.\n\nStay out of or eliminate discretionary debt. You may need loans for a car or house. You don't need credit card debt for bar drinks, restaurant meals, vacations.\n\nInvest in yourself first to increase the amount of money you make - education, training, networking, etc. The more money you make, the more you have to invest.\n\nBuild an emergency fund of at least three months of secure savings to cover essential expenses in case of income loss or other emergency. This belongs in high yield savings, not stocks.\n\nAfter that, get started investing for retirement. This is the money that belongs in stocks.\n\nAs a fully functioning adult you will need additional savings for things like car down payment, car replacement, home down payment, home and car maintenance, vacations, etc.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/)\n\nGood luck. I stumbled my way through it. Maybe you will be more organized and effective.",

I also apply legal agreements to protect the customer, I feel it\u2019s fair form of showing your genuine intent with someone else\u2019s money\u2026but at times, these aspects can seemingly detract custom as they are of the belief that something can\u2019t be this simple to make money\u2026.yet I\u2019m of the belief that all parties should benefit, nothing less. So I\u2019m also asking if the terms within an investment opportunity are kind\u2026why do they have a reverse effect in a sense, where scepticism comes in to play\u2026yet this is all produced through legitimate means, through my own personal banking, with no stone unturned in a transparency form.

Private/illiquid/leveraged/high risk investments should command higher expected returns. Depends on risk but something in the 15-20% range would be reasonable for a high debt private equity. If you offer more than that, the implication is that you do not intend to deliver any actual returns and can just pick any number would be most attractive to investors.  \n\nThe second flag is explicitly offering any particular numeric return, particularly a tight range like 8-10%. The tight range implies low risk which is in conflict with the high returns implying extreme risk.  \n\nAnother flag is being vague about how returns would be generated. Your \"own personal banking\" is a very weird description of a business. Perhaps this is less of a flag with others since you disclose the business activity to them better, but even then, they may not believe your explanation.",

The reason my returns are seen as generous is simply down to the revenue any input pulls in\u2026so again 8-10% is easily achievable\u2026but based on the figures you put to me by yourself, I can definitely see why there would be scepticism. The reason for coming across as vague is because I was here to ask questions and not to advertise. My work is totally genuine hence why I\u2019m asking publicly and have never gone down a private message route or hassling people, as we all have a right to our own privacy. By personal banking I mean that the returns go in to my own personal banking (building society)\u2026not some dodgy business account, so anyone who is interested can see exactly where the monies are sourced from, profit against loss etc, all genuine, legal and above board. So when I disclose this\u2026these are my own statements\u2026again I can date back 8 years worth of work, this is personal info but it\u2019s something I\u2019m happy to disclose if there is a level of interest, not something I\u2019m going to advertise publicly.",

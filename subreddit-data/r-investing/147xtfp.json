    "postText": "This is a Nationwide 401K plan. I'm content with my investment options, which have decent expense ratios. The current one I have 100% invested in is TIAACRF LycCycInd 2065 Inst (TFITX) with a 0.10% ER, but the management fee is 0.60%, totaling the 0.70%. We have FXAIX and VTSAX, which has 0.01% and 0.04% ERs, respectively, but that 0.60% is added on to both. Those are probably the 2 lowest options.\n\nI was freaking out paying $22 a month and $24 a year to maintain my former employer's Vanguard 401k, but I didn't realize the management fees  for new employer until transferred over to the Nationwide one. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI been going through reddit and have been seeing paying higher management fees over 1% and some times even 2% (outrageous), so I was just gauging if I should be losing any sleep over this plan. I know it' s not great.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

If you open a Vanguard IRA you will have no fees on that money besides and fees for the fund but those should be .1 or below. Since its not $ and is % will save money by moving money out",

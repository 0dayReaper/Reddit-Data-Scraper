    "postText": "I am unemployed but have a 401k I rolled over into a Fidelity IRA a few years ago from my last job.  Its in a target date fund (FFFGX) and each year I contribute my max IRA amount. \n\nI've now learned that this has a pretty high expense ratio. I found a similar target date fund with Fidelity that offers a way lower expense ratio (FIOFX).  \n\nAll future IRA contributions will go to the new fund of course.  But can I just click a few buttons on my Fidelity account and move the whole rollover account from FFFGX to FIOFX?  It has an option under trade to just \"exchange\" and I'd move it all into the new FIOFX. \n\nI guess my fear is that it will create some kind of taxable event or something that will cost me or cause a problem?  I feel silly even asking this, but before I move that type of money just want to make sure I understand what I'm doing.",

You may want to follow r/bogleheads sub for low fee conservative etf and mutual fund selections. Target date funds have not done great with past performance and looks like you may have 20 plus years until retirement.",

I recently helped my brother transfer his company IRA into a Fidelity self directed account and there were some hoops to jump through. It took (2) representatives getting on the line to facilitate the transfer, and his main concern was avoiding a taxable event in the process. Good luck",

No taxable event will occur, which was the concern. They already have the fund picked out. Why would they need to talk to a Fidelity rep?",

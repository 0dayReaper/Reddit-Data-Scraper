    "postText": "\nUSFR is a 13 week T-Bill etf and pays slightly more than the actual T-Bill (spread) but is still in the low 5s.. Is there a 4 week T-Bill ETF that gets closer to 6% similar to the return of the actual T-Bill? \n\nSeem like most of the ETFs are 1-3 month T-Bills and are returning closer to 5.2%. Can\u2019t seem to find a 4 weeker. Prefer ETF over the actual T-Bill for simplicity.",

SGOV holds T-bills in the 0-3M maturity.\n\nNo ETFs I know of hold 4-weeks T-bills, because it\u2019s only recently that they have yielded this much.\n\nYour best bet is to monitor the prices in the secondary market on US01MY and put in a noncompetitive bid before it closes, 15min before 11:30a EDT. For example, I got 5.872% this past Thursday on TreasuryDirect. You basically have to not be lazy and do it yourself if money matters to you.",

    "postText": "So my portfolio is mainly just Microsoft stock (MSFT). I recently sold some stock that was long (i.e. bought over a year ago). I haven't recently bought MSFT stock so I have no idea why I'm seeing a wash sale:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/9zKdVT9\n\nAlso, I have no idea why the cost basis is $359, MSFT hasn't been that high in 3 years, and I suspect it's never been that high",

If you reinvested this dividend (used it to purchase shares) and sold any shares for a capital loss within 30 days before or after June 8th, this would trigger a wash sale. This lines up with the date in your screenshot. Did you sell any shares below their cost basis in May or June?",

I worked hard and was promoted to assistant manager and offered the head manager job which I declined because it didn\u2019t pay enough and I was only using the job to pay for some schooling for myself. Regularly, I would review applications for the other assistant manager job from people with degrees. For a job I already had and one below what I could have had but it wasn\u2019t good enough for me. At 18 without a degree at the time. That was an eye opener that helped me decide to focus my education on something that will actually pay me.\nEdit: the analysis shows there are no useless degrees meaning a poor degree MAY help you earn a little bit more than someone without. But making 2 bucks an hour more than you would have otherwise after using 4 years of income building time to get a bad degree and then funding it with 55k of student debt\u2026.well that doesn\u2019t seem useful to me.",

Is the earnings of someone working full time without a degree significantly less than the wage of someone who has a basic arts degree? And does that amount account for the 4 years of lost wages and additional debt taken on to get said degree? \nClearly if you take a degree for say hand therapy masters and compare it to a non degree worker, gap is huge. Likely the gap is huge in general when averaged out. But I doubt very much that it\u2019s a prudent or financially intelligent path to get a basic arts degree or one of the several other degrees out there in that basic line vs just getting into the work force earlier, investing earlier etc. I\u2019m not comparing the average degree to the average non degree here. I\u2019m not disputing that because I agree. I\u2019m saying there are absolutely degrees that will never ever make up the cost. Avoid those ones.\nI am 100 percent in favour of investing in oneself and most education/trades etc. I\u2019m just pointing out university is big business and not every degree is a good investment. There most certainly are foolish investments in the education field.",

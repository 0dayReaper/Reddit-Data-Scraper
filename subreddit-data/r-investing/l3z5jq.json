    "postText": "What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Title|Tickers|Avg Hype %|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|[(GME DD) One DD to rule them. One DD to find them.

Especially when it overflows into everyday media like the GME hype has. A lot of these guys will have even more money to fuck around with after this short squeeze ends which gives them more power. It would not surprise me if laws change after this GME hype, as it\u2019s becoming apparent Reddit and WSB\u2019s power to manipulate stock price.

I think implementing this as a daily parse, then putting the totals into db per post, then comparing it with previous day to mark a trend in up or down direction might be a great next step. After testing to verify that works you could then bump up the parse rhythm to a smaller time frame and have a pretty active ticker.",

However, your post is an exception to the rule because of a few reasons. I like that you aren't trying to make projections about which stocks are going to do what. Additionally, I like that you are posting the links for the sub-forums so that others can review the information on their own without trying to rely on others. Lastly, I like that you are posting the tickers for the stocks so that people can easily review those stocks without having to waste time with finding it.\n\nI am hoping to follow your posts some more in the hopes of, mainly, seeing which stocks are out there and if I might be interested in buying some.",

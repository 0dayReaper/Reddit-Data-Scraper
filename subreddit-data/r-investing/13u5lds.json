    "postText": "Bought a small ADBE position in late 2020 and fall 2021, about a dozen shares. Avg cost basis = 523. Performance has been underwhelming to say the least with the tech sell off, though it\u2019s just broken back over 400.\n\nIf you\u2019re ok with having those funds tied up for 2-4 more years would you hold, buy more, or just take the tax loss now?\n\nIs ADBE\u2019s AI involvement via PhotoShop enough to want to stay in? Like does it deepen the moat enough to make it worthwhile or is it just one product.",

They\u2019re an extremely large organization, which makes it unlikely for them to fail, but certainly makes them slow to react. For example, they completely messed up with Adobe XD and couldn\u2019t keep up with Figma. Until they bought it. They also messed up by not releasing any valuable product in the last 5 years, at times where everyone was becoming a content creator and needed an app to design stuff. Companies like Canva, Lightricks and others rose up to fill the gap. So I wouldn\u2019t bet them on them product-wise, they lack the innovation and culture to stay a major technological competitor.",

If they didn't do that, it was game over.\n* Photoshop and Illustrator are less and less used, because everything is going digital and some tools (like Figma) do the job better. You work in advertising so you might not notice this trend, but as a Product Designer, I can tell you that if I didn't get Adobe license from my company I wouldn't buy it myself. It's not worth it. And more and more people are joining this profession. \n* Adobe in general seems to have a very \"corporate\" atmosphere and just can't release impactful, innovative products. I doubt they'll do something in this age of AI. \n* Ultimately, the best product will win. I just don't trust Adobe to do that.",

I love running. I know for a fact that ASICS for instance is the better brand. But when I go running or to the gym 80% of people wear Nike.\n\nAnother example. There are a shitload of beers that taste better and are cheaper than the ones of the Heineken group or the Anheuser group, but they are like 40% of all the market share. Same with hard alcohol drinks, but yet Diageo and Pernod Ricard are the top brands, and when you go to a bar, club, restaurant...you drink Absolut, Ciroc or Tanqueray\n\nI get your point. But 99% of ADBE users are not looking for THE BEST. Only the pros.\n\nThat's a common mistake I had previously committed myself, and I think Buffet or Lynch addressed that issue",

I'm not shorting it, but I'm watching closely because if it does start going down I want to have my money ready. And I think it could fall quickly too. Think about how irrational the runup on NVDA was last week and then imagine the opposite happening with Adobe at the first sign of weakness.",

No idea why - I was just totally checked out, and tech while it's an area I HAVE to be invested in does not genuinely interest me, so I don't pay attention to it as much as sectors I like.

I want to max out my Roth IRA now. Is there any issue making a backdoor contribution now and then finding out at tax time we were under the income limit anyways?",

            "comment": "If you consider the process that a backdoor IRA follows:\n\n1. Contribute to a pretax IRA with posttax money.\n2. Perhaps wait some time. Some say the IRS frowns on this process and that waiting between the two steps helps. To me this seems like putting your beer can in a paper bag and drinking from the bag: everybody knows what you're actually doing.\n3. Make certain you have zero dollars in any pretax IRA accounts for the person about to make a conversion.\n4. Instruct your broker to convert your pretax IRA dollars to Roth IRA account.\n5. Complete the IRS form (8606 I think)  to inform them that you have no taxable basis in the account.\n\nThere should be no downside other than the extra steps involved - unless you already have some pretax IRAs! The conversation step requires that you pay a pro-rata share of taxes if you do. Google that for more info if it affects you.\n\nIf you do have pretax IRAs, then you would prefer to do the direct Roth contribution instead, in which case your income limits may be an issue. Perhaps you could increase 401k contributions to make sure you stay under the limit, or consider a charitable gift find donation to lump your charitable contributions for the next few years into this year.\n\nWhatever you do, know that I'm just some guy on the Internet, not a tax advisor, and my advice is worth zero and may be totally wrong.",

    "postText": "The vast majority of analysts &amp; talking heads I see maintain that the market is currently pricing in two interest rate cuts by the Fed by the end of the year. But Fed Chairman Powell and other Fed officials have all said that the Fed won't be cutting rates in 2023.\n\nSo my question is this: If there aren't any interest rate cuts this year (and personally I think that's going to be the case) how much lower would an informed, rational market be at this point?",

Given how many other financial assets are tied to the rate on Treasuries, higher borrowing costs for the government also raise costs for banks, companies and other borrowers, and could create a similar effect to roughly one or two quarter-point rate increases from the Federal Reserve, analysts have warned.",

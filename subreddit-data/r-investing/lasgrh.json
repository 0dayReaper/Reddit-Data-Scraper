    "postText": "*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*\n\nBefore I get into Monday's action, a couple of things:\n\nI wanted to first give a shout out to /u/piddlesthethug for capturing [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu), which shows that moment in time I referenced in my [third Gamestop post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/), where some poor soul got sniped while sweeping the 29 January 115 calls.  I added it into the post with an edit, but my guess is most who read the post a while back would have missed it.  I guess my mental math in the moment was off as you can see from the image that the cost was actually just shy of $500k rather than $440k as I wrote in the post.  Brutal.\n\nPeople have also asked me where I stand on this trade.  I was lucky to get in early, trade some momentum, and retain a sizeable core holding (relative to my play account).  As I've mentioned some comments, my core holding, which I will hold until this saga plays itself out, would buy me a new car, all cash.  Though after today I'd have to downgrade from a lower end Lexus to a Corolla lol.\n\nAlright, so, today's action.\n\nI have to admit that I was just glancing at the chart between writing emails, working on excel spreadsheets, conference calls, and meetings.  Whenever I could, I was listening to CNBC in the background, and taking a closer look whenever I heard anything that might move sentiment, or theoretically telegraph an attack as had happened so many times last week.\n\nIn my opinion the price action played out almost by-the-numbers according to a squeeze campaign strategy as I laid out in my previous post.  I want to be clear, however, that while it was consistent with what I laid out (liquidity drying up, trying to skirmish at lower and lower price points), you could reasonably interpret it other ways.  As I mentioned in at least one comment, seeing things play out in a manner consistent with your expectations is by no means positive confirmation that your thesis is correct.  It just happens to be consistent with the evidence you have so far.  Always keep that in mind.\n\nI tried responding to a few comments and questions in realtime as I got notifications on my phone.  Just as a heads up, I won't always be able to do so, and it seems like there were a number of knowledgeable people commenting in realtime anyway.  As I've said in comments on my previous posts, I am definitely not the smartest person in the room, so don't just take my word for it just because I'm the original poster.  Please challenge anything I say if you feel I'm mistaken, and don't dismiss out of hand people who may have a different viewpoint.\n\nOne thing I thought I noticed in early morning market hours action was that there was no sell order depth above the ticker price, which I interpret as a good sign.  Downward pushes into fairly good volume got sucked back up largely in a low-volume vacuum.  The most extreme example of this was the first push right at market open.  Tons of volume to push the price down, then a tiny fraction of volume as price got sucked back up.  This means very little continued panicking and bailing due to the aggressive push, resulting in gaps to the upside on the follow-on buying.  There were messages and comments from people concerned that low price would let the short side cover, but, as I explained, low price doesn't help the short side unless they can buy at that low price in meaningful volume.  That sort of action where price gaps up as soon as buying (whether by shorts or longs) is driving price tells you that there isn't much meaningful volume to be had at the lower prices.  From a higher level view, volume through the day dropped as price dropped, and that seems to have remained consistently true throughout the day.\n\nThere was some very strange after-market volume.  No idea what that may have been, other than maybe hedge unwinding as T+2 contract settlement outcomes were determined.  It seemed, at least to me, to be too much volume in too dense a time window to be retailers bailing out of their accounts en mass.  It would make no sense to do so into the vacuum of after hours anyway rather than the firmer price support of market hours.\n\nI got messages that I was both a short side hedge fund shill and a long side pump and dump fraudster trying to somehow take peoples' money.  My sentiment analysis KPIs thus indicate I'm likely striking a healthy balance (lol).\n\n# The Game (Theory)\n\nOk, but seriously, is this situation a pump and dump?\n\nPossibly.\n\nI say possibly because, as I stated in a comment, a failed squeeze campaign is effectively identical to a pump and dump in that the only thing that happens is capital is transferred mostly from people who got in later to people who got in earlier.  Even worse, in aggregate a good amount of capital may end up being transferred from the campaigners to the short side.  Not that it was necessarily intended to be that way from the start--it's just what ends up happening if the campaign fails.\n\nOk, so failure aside, what are the dynamics of the trade?  What kind of game is this?\n\nIn simplified terms, I'd describe a squeeze campaign where the short side doubles down as a modified [dollar auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction) where the winning side also takes the losing side's bid money.  In other words, at an aggregate level, it's winner take all, go hard or go home, with all the excitement of market action in the middle.  Note that I said in aggregate and with market action in the middle, as that basically means even the winning side will have individuals who lose possibly everything if they get washed out before the end.  As I mentioned in some comments where I urged people to consider taking profits if they needed the money, this is going to be a white-knuckle trade to the very end.\n\n# Power\n\nFor most of our lives, most of the time, the saying that 'information is power' and the closely related 'knowledge is power' are abstract, philosophical truisms that people say to try to sound cool and edgy.  More tangible and relevant to our daily lives might be 'money is power', or, for the least fortunate, the threat and reality of physical force.\n\nToday, for many in the GME trade, that previously abstract philosophical truism gained intense and urgent relevance.  What is current SI?  Can you trust numbers from S3?  What about Ortex?  Are there counterfeit shares in play?  What is the significance of Failures to Deliver? Can the short side cover their position off the exchange? etc. etc.\n\nBeing in this situation, if nothing else, has lifted the veil for many people.  The right information, in the right circumstances, is incredibly powerful.  It outlines in stark contrast the power dynamics of information asymmetry.\n\nIf you want to exercise more agency in your future as a trader and investor, you have to make a habit of cultivating your critical thinking skills and ensuring you have diverse and often divergent sources of information. Do not let yourself be trapped in an information bubble where you can be easily manipulated.  Most of all, try to avoid developing a [siege mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_mentality) at all costs.  If nothing else, in my opinion, it's critical for your long-term financial success.\n\nI don't know the answer to those questions definitively, and my purpose in creating this account and posting is absolutely not to get people to listen and necessarily believe everything I write.  In fact, it would make me happier if I see people use some of the tools, techniques, and concepts I've tried to introduce to challenge some of my thinking.  Catching my mistakes helps me.  Doing it in the open for all to read helps everyone.\n\n# Faith, Conviction, Calculated Risk\n\nMany people trade and invest according to wildly divergent strategies.\n\nSome people, including those that most Wall Street types consider to be 'responsible' investors, invest on blind faith.  You put your capital is someone else's hands (hopefully a qualified fiduciary), and trust that they will do a good job.  The only judgment you exercise really is in choosing the person(s) in which to place your faith.  This is not entirely unlike what many WSBettors are doing with respect to DFV.  I do this with my retirement accounts, though lately I've been considering transferring about half my retirement capital to a self-directed IRA.\n\nOthers trade on conviction.  They have, for whatever reason, a very strong belief in an investment thesis that they are willing to put to the test by putting capital at risk, and are willing to lean into the thesis through unfavorable price action so long as no disconfirming evidence comes to light.  I consider value investors to fall into this category.\n\nOthers are momentum traders and 'technical analysts', who are trying to read the market data to look for asymmetrical calculated risk opportunity.  These opportunities need not necessarily be tied to any particular underlying fundamental investment thesis.  All that matters is whether you win on a sufficiently frequent basis and carefully manage your downside risk.\n\nI think it's healthy to try to gain an understanding of all three approaches.  I personally also find it necessary to be careful if you find yourself switching between those approaches mid-trade.  I.e., if you started in the GME trade on faith, it may be deeply disturbing if you find yourself in the no-man's land between faith and conviction, where you have learned enough to understand more of the risks in the trade, but not enough to understand the underlying investment thesis of how it could play out.  I'm not saying you shouldn't try to make that transition--just try to maintain self awareness if you choose to do so to avoid making any rash decisions.\n\n# Swimming In The Deep\n\nSo, the consistent #1 question I always get: what happens next?  My consistent answer, which I know frustrates everyone, is I don't know, and no one else does either.\n\nOne person in the comments made an astute observation that perhaps the truth, which some may find disturbing, is that our fate really lies in the hands of the whales on the long side rather than retail being in the driver's seat.  This may very well be true.  I would give it better than even odds at this point.  In fact, even if retail collectively represents more shares in this trade, retail is not a well-organized, monolithic entity, and therefore would have more difficulty playing a decisive role at critical times.\n\nAnother question I got, which was a very good one to be asking, is what evidence do we have that there really are whales on the long side?  For me, there have been critical actions over the past few days that I would have found to be highly unlikely to be achievable by retail investors, such as the sustained HFT duel into the close on Friday.  That was very consistent, relatively well controlled, and sustained push on volume of 6-7mio shares traded in the $250 - $330/share price range.  Oversimplified math would peg that at just shy of $2bn in capital flow.  That is not retail--particularly with so many retail brokerages restricting trading at that time.  The 17mio shares sold into the aftermarket action consistent with a squeeze (and Ortex reported reduction in short interest) is also definitely not retail.  Others have pointed out massive action in the options today.  Tons of block purchases in the millions of dollars and high 6 figures.  Not retail.\n\nAll of that being said, does that really change very much?  Even if you consider yourself to be part of a movement, and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows (I do, which is why I'm writing these posts and holding that core position), in the end you are trading as an individual.  This is a point that I have made repeatedly.  In the end, you need to know yourself, know your trade, and have a plan.  Your plan may conceivably be to follow someone else (I know many are following DFV to whatever the end may be), but in the end even that is still your plan as an individual.\n\nIf my thesis is correct we will continue to see lower trade volumes, and price grinding down to a floor of harder support, possibly even at the retail line of support (\\~$148/$150) I outlined in a prior post.  There may also be some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract T+2 settlement impact.  I don't know enough about what to expect there.  If the squeeze is to happen, unless RH lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes a surge of retail momentum, it will happen after that type of price movement continues for a while (maybe days, maybe longer), until sufficient liquid float has been locked up.\n\nRight now options action is heavily weighted to puts, so any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price.\n\nIf the squeeze fails to happen there won't be a siren, ringing of a bell, or anything like that.  It might happen gradually and non-obviously until suddenly, as only the market seems to be able to do, it becomes obvious that whoever's still there has been left holding the bag.  Hopefully this isn't the case, but if it is I'll be right there with what at that point may only buy me a razor scooter rather than a car lol.\n\nIf it succeeds, it should be fairly obvious.  Just don't forget to ring the register!\n\nEither way, this is market history in the making.  As I said in a previous comment, when you ride the rocket, it's definitely not going to be smooth--but it might just be awesome.\n\nApologies for the lengthy post again.  Good luck in the market!",

            "comment": "I have a question while I wait to read this post. This may be a stupid question. I'm a long term investor and never pay attention to stuff like this. So if I'm understanding the situation here correctly, reported SI is down from over ~120% to 50-60% according to Ortex and S3 over the weekend. People are unconvinced as there is not enough volume for the shorts to cover in that time (and shouldn't the price move up instead of down if they're buying hard to get stocks?). Institutional investors hold a large amount of the stock, so could the shorts in theory cut a deal with the long institutional investors to cover at a more reasonable rate? If that's possible, would the market volume reflect that deal?            \n              \nEdit: I never thought I would enjoy reading stuff like this, your posts are very entertaining and insightful, thanks for taking the time to write them.",

This is pretty unusual as both parties cannot be sure that they are in fact getting a fair price, but there may be other reasons behind the decision.  So in theory, definitely possible, though I have no idea how to determine how likely.\n\nThat being said, SI of 50% - 60% is still extremely high.  The greater concern from my perspective is whether any covering activity allows them to free up more liquid float.  For example, if the covering resulted in returning shares to brokerages from which they can re-borrow at a later time, then that is backup float liquidity for use in later attacks.  Not the end of the world by any means, but can draw things out longer.\n\n**edit** looks like /u/MrMacStripe has a much better answer.",

                            "comment": "Doesn't it matter at which price points the remaining 50% SI were shorted? In the beginning, throughout the last week, I think it was fair to assume that a great many of the really low shorts were not yet covered, but I think they probably placed a whole lot of shorts at higher positions while they were at it. Be it to stop explosive price increases or to profit once the price finally goes back down.  \nSo really, if a great number of the remaining 50% SI is sitting at some kind of distribution from, say, 70$ all the way up to &gt;300$, then that's much less pressure than we would expect if we assumed all these shorts sitting at 30$ or similar.   \n\n\nNow, regarding the possibility of a squeeze, the only things that would lead me to believe that (even more of) a squeeze might still happen are that the %SI is just plain wrong and the current media shitstorm regarding SLV. I don't really trust the theory going around that what we are seeing regarding the price movements starting Thursday was all short ladders, that kind of feels like wishful thinking to me, honestly.   \n\n\nIt would be interesting to know how orbex and s3 arrive at their %SI estimates. That's something I haven't seen anyone discuss before. I think that they both arrive at similar numbers actually lends them a lot of credibility in my eyes. However, without knowing how they model this, it feels like a black box that might even get tricked by HFs.",

That prevents The squeeze In the first place. no one said you had to close out all the positions in al at the same timee..\n\ncall you were doing that you would also open up new short positions at higher prices like 200-300-400.. that hedges you against losses and even if you can't do it you're a hedge funds who can.. so somebody did..\n\n\nThen let's look at other stuff.

He has countered most of what you've pointed out. \n\nCNBC or WSJ aren't manipulating. They are stupid and bad/lagging at reporting. Barely anyone called for regulations on retail investors and I've only heard regulations for hedge funds and such from people like Elizabeth Warren which are the people that matter because they are making the regulations. Trading restrictions on brokers like RH or TD were not placed out of malice. These brokers and clearing houses had liquidity issues because clearing houses asked for a very high collateral due to the volatility in the stock. Brokers like RH had no choice but to stop trading certain stocks because they literally couldn't pay the collateral. The volatility was created because a ton of retail investors and institutional investors piled in unexpectedly. Cuban also pointed out that short ladder attacks are likely not happening.",

I'm fully willing to believe that some wealthy interests are pulling out all the stops to fight this, but at the same time, for something that smells like money this much, there are other billionaires pulling strings on this side.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I considered getting into it last wednesday and I'm (currently) glad I didn't, because I don't need the emotional strain.

I couldn't sleep last night and sold at pre-market for a substantially lower loss (still up 6k from GME thank goodness, too much money for me to lose when I could help myself/my family) for this reason. I mean, the short squeeze looked like it happened last week. How could it not? Last years low was around 2.80? to 480?!? HOLY MOTHER OF FUCK.\n\nThen it got me thinking with the short data that we can't trust. We just can't trust it. And even if the float is shorted over 100%, do **we actually know** what the consequences are of that? We're finding out in real time. Also, we don't know all of the entries on the shorts?! How the flip can we still think this thing can squeeze?!",

I had the same realization as I was trying to get to sleep last night and I woke up at pre-market and emptied myself of my GME shares...I still made a profit but my judgement was definitely clouded in the echo chambers of reddit, I was pretty ready to unload at 300 but the combination of emotion, greed, 'stickin it to the man', and the echo chamber really messed me up. \n\nMy thought process was practically the same -- flipped the coin and started thinking about what if we are all wrong and it already squeezed? There was a huge spike last week ... we were already up a ton. Then came a thought that if they are willing to bend some rules or do something I'm unaware of -- I'm not a market expert maybe I'm missing some info here (not saying they did illegal things but I wouldn't put it past big money). Then came the whole conspiracy theories and \"we can't trust the numbers!\" then what can we trust? It was getting too Qanon-y for my liking and rationality won out this morning and I came out of this unscathed (and a relatively tidy profit).",

Like others I watched *The Big Short* and have *All the Devils are Here* waiting on my shelf to be read. Because of all the Robinhood drama, I opened an Fidelity brokerage account, which my retirement happens to be with as well. I can now keep track of it better through the app. For me, there is a lot of secondary and tertiary good things coming out of this situation. \n\nI may have bought a handful of shares in a certain movie theater chain and I may be holding them with a grip made out of compressed carbon. They have been playing old movies for $5 cheap. I've seen awesome ones like T2, Goldfinger, Alien, and The Empire Strikes Back\u2014 I think that's great they've been doing that and I hope they keep it up. On the other hand, I'm not the type of person to dump all of my savings into an emotional craze. I set a low-ball limit buy and waited. \n\nThat's just my opinion, not advice.",

However, I will say this: Fear is giving you this anxiety. Maximum FOMO is when you see green candles going up until the fear makes you punch the buy order in. Maximum despair and fear of life-altering losses hits peak during deep downward price movements, making you punch out to avoid losing your entire position. Fear makes you buy high and sell low. HFT houses are full of algorithms designed to exploit fear through the price movement, and find gaps in your risk mitigation strategy (e.g. stop-loss hunting algorithms, etc.). If fear is driving you to trade, I urge you not to swim in low-liquidity waters with sharks who specifically make their money exploiting fear.*",

That's what it sure looks like.. you don't want to lose money.. so you need to figure out a good price point based on where you bought in so that you don't lose too much money.. and then you sell at that point.. maybe it will rock it to the moon. Maybe it would hit Ellen thousand dollars eventually. And he will have missed that opportunity.. but maybe it won't. And it's more likely that it wouldntt..\n\nSo do you really want to gamble and potentially lose out on a lot of money on the off chance it's going to go up? This isn't stock investing. It's gambling.. you should treat it just like at the casino.. you made some winnings. Yes if you keep playing there's a chance that you'll also hit it and double your money. Or there's a chance that the house wins.. you need to figure out how much you're comfortable gambling and whether you're comfortable potentially losing money to the house on the off chance that you could get mlree",

There are a dozen DD articles on why it's already over.  And it all makes sense.  I feel like I'm Dorothy standing in front of the Wizard of Oz before the curtain gets pulled back.  I just don't know enough about how the guys behind the curtain are pulling the switches.\n\nI should've sold at $350.  I was waiting for $400-$500 (in non-after-hours trading).  Profit would've been great at $350, but the DD numbers made sense.  So I waited.\n\nI was in for 174 @ $120.  I sold 107 this morning at break-even price for those 3 lots.  No harm no foul, lesson learned (?), and disappointment that I wasn't smart enough to see what was happening even in the face of what I believed to be good DD.\n\nI still have 67 @ $165, about half that lot is in the mid $30's so profits on one offset some of the losses on the other.  \n\nThe most likely scenario is that I'll exit that with a loss of some kind.  The next most likely scenario is that I exit at break even.  I will have spent the last 2 weeks (and maybe another next week) watching and reading and panicking for nothing.  And that's the best-case scenario unless the run-up is supersonic.\n\nThe problem is still that I think the DD is good.  I think the theory and the numbers and the math are good.  I just think that I'm not smart enough for this game and I'm not willing to risk my family's money trying to prove it one way or the other.  If I lost it all my wife would be mad, extremely mad, but we wouldn't miss a mortgage, we wouldn't go hungry, we would still be able to make our bills, and I'd feel like shit about putting my family in that situation.  I just don't know how to turn this into a learning lesson while still thinking the DD is good when it clearly wasn't (or maybe it is but just not yet).",

I should have sold around $310 and would have locked in enough alpha to pay off the car and some debt that's been bugging the wife and I. Instead I convinced myself that the case was compelling enough that an infinite squeeze was just around the corner. I suckered myself into lowering stop losses and overextending myself out of greed and impatience. I'm out just a few hundred above my break even so certainly not a worst case scenario, but feeling extremely humbled by my behavior this past week. In fact I was so disappointed in myself I pulled everything out of my investment account except my baseline trading money so that I would stave off any temptation to get back in the game. If I had lost everything my wife would have been PISSED, but like you we wouldn't be starving or lose the roof from over our heads. If anything I'm just a little ego bruised and hope that on the next one I'll have some more discipline to look at the counter arguments when I'm on top.",

No one really knew what the outcome was going to be.\n\nI blew up accounts before, since then I've tried to not trade with emotions and not be overly greedy. I was able to close GME with good gains on Friday because I thought the hype was going to slow with the weekend crossing by. Plus, I live in Mexico and our market was going to be closed on the Monday holiday, so I knew I was going to be powerless either if the infinity squeeze happened or it all went down in flames. I also had the feeling that a 20x run was realistic enough to consider we were already on the squeeze. My losses have teached me that it's impossible to always sell at the top, not every dip will go up again and gains are gains, so I sold against the WSB hold mantra. At the end of the day, we all look for ourselves, and all of us would have signed with blood to get at least a 100% gain when we dumped money into our accounts.\n\nYou've not lost everything as I have before, but I'm sure it is still a good lesson. Again, don't be too hard on yourself, you were smart enough already since you were in a great gains position. I wouldn't say the same if you bought at $400. I hope you can break as even as possible and I'm sure next time you will make the right call and click that sell button. There will be more opportunities. You will feel better regretting not making more money, rather than not have maked anything at all.\n\nEdit: a mispelled word and thanks for the award!",

I appreciate your honesty - I know a lot of people are going to lose a lot and feel really ashamed for falling for this. I still have this tiny piece of doubt, but I know it's just FOMO. I was out of my depth, I got caught up in the hype, and then sometime yesterday evening I realized everyone was just repeating the same stuff and thinking the entire MSM was conspiring against them. I snapped out of it and was kicking myself all night. I'm so grateful I didn't buy more than 2 shares. As far as lessons go - here's mine. I've always been fascinated by cults. I love love love reading about them, and about scams, and MLMs, and all the like. I'm a religious studies major, and that kind of stuff really scratches an itch for me. But I never knew how people could fall for that stuff. How does someone fall for a phishing scam? Its hard for me, as a 22 yo who grew up on the internet, to have sympathy when someone sends off their bank account info to a sketchy email scam. But this - this was designed for people like me. The social media, the memes, the hype, the promise of wealth - it was the perfect storm, and I fell for all the classic cult tactics without realizing it. Only now can I see the confirmation bias, the sunk cost fallacy, the group think, and so on. I now have so much more sympathy for people who fall for cults and scams. I see that no one is totally immune to these tactics, and its nothing to be ashamed of. It just needs to be talked about. I think of this as a $150 interactive crash course on cult psychology and stock market basics, and to me personally it was totally worth that much.

As of Thursday morning the squeeze seemed very plausible if the momentum held, but then the sudden stranglehold on retail shares just throttled it completely.\n\nThe other thing that seems clear in retrospect - but was not at the forefront of the DD - is that the funds / whales who were long did not use their buying power to fuel a squeeze and instead used it as a more modest pump and dump opportunity.  Maybe they were skeptical of the big squeeze thesis, maybe they just wanted to grab the low-hanging fruit, or maybe they didn't want risk a truly epic squeeze tanking the broader market.  Maybe a combination of all of the above.",

I've found them to be very insightful during these weird and incredibly volatile times.\n\n I am curious to hear your take on the recent decision to add GME to the NYSE short restrictions list starting tomorrow. Many (on the WSB side) are saying that this could potentially limit the alleged short ladders that have been keeping the price of GME down. I have also heard other opinions suggesting that this will have no impact because it either doesn't apply to anything WSB claims or there will just be an alternative strategy to keep the prices on a downward trajectory.",

I don't understand why everyone is acting like there wasn't a squeeze. \n\nimo, the important thing to note about this saga is that the true cause of a short squeeze is hedge funds wanting to bail out of a position. The actual number of short interest isn't really relevant beyond a high number being a requirement for a big squeeze and a large number signifying that a large number of hedge funds are in short and you can potentially see a situation where a hedge fund short has a low risk tolerance on this particular stock and bails raising the price past another funds risk tolerance threshold and so on. As far as I know there's not really a human involved in these kind of in hours trades at hedge funds, so it happens more than you'd think.",

            "comment": "Why people are still holding this after it's fallen to ~$100 is beyond me. The game was rigged against them from the start regarding bankrupting hedge funds. The smart people bought low and sold early in the spikes to $350 or so and ran as far away as they could.\n\nIt's unfortunate but many people have put in their retirement/life savings in this and won't have much left. They got swept up in social media hype from anonymous people (you know, people that can easily lie and manipulate you) and random d-list celebrities pushing them along that they will magically make 1000x their money... TBH even if the squeeze does happen, which I don't believe, it will be so fast 90% of those that are holding will miss it and will be left holding their bag either way.\n\nWhat I really hate is that they convinced the guy on WSB to hold, the one that should've made like 40 millions but has lost more than half of that now. I feel he would've sold without the spotlight on him and he deserves his money TBH after holding it for years. By association, many others are holding because of the group mentality when they should all be gone from the position. What more could you have wanted than like 20x profits that we saw?\n\nI don't know, I didn't touch these stocks because I'm risk averse and I'm OK with that but I feel a ton of people are just swept in mass hysteria at this point. If people didn't sell when a $20 stock reached $400 that's them being insane IMO. That was already a miracle of coordinated buying, how some people convinced themselves this wasn't enough is mindblowing to me.",

Thought I could ride the wave up and \"get out in time\" not realizing at the time that I didn't actually have a plan for what \"get out in time\" was going to look like.\n\nSame thing happening again when it ran up to $41 and now back down in the low 30s.\n\nThe worst part is that there really isn't ever a community-based reckoning. The community grows the most\u2014and with the least diligent/disciplined people just before each peak. The number of people who pour in is so overwhelming that the character of the community is forever changed, even after most of them leave after getting their asses kicked.\n\nIt's kind of like a doomsday cult. The original thesis remains, it's just that the prophecy has been... delayed. The same people are still out to get you, and the thing to do is to buy more and hold on. It becomes embedded in the culture, just like is happening right now in r/wallstreetbets.\n\nThe next time an opportunity comes along, the same people will pour back in at the last moment (too late) with the same narrative, and it will all repeat itself.\n\nKind of nihilist perspective, but it is what it is, and I've learned to accept it and even kind of appreciate it as a \"sentiment indicator\" since there are no  value signals or fundamentals to base crypto trades on.",

            "comment": "I have a theory at what we've witnessed as well with GME.\n\nI'm not one who traditionally believes in conspiracy theories, but I do know that money can cause firms, and individuals to break the law in a coordinated effort.\n\nWith as much money that was at stake here, it would not surprise me in the slightest.\n\nFirst the disclaimer.\n\nI don't own GME, and I'm not a financial advisor.\n\nHere goes.\n\nExhibit A) I didn't see this mentioned on here, but I came across this article on Thursday morning about an institutional investment firm selling off their shares.\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/large-gamestop-shareholder-must-asset-management-sold-off-its-stake-2021-01-28\n\nHard to know exactly when this sale happened, but I'd venture to guess it was a coordinated sale between the MUST management investment firm, and the hedge funds that happened just before/after closing on Wednesday evening. TD Ameritrade, Robinhood, Webull and Interactive Brokers then coordinated between themselves, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds to lock the casual retail investor from being able to scoop up much of the stock that was dumped by MUST management that evening, and the next day.\n\nMelvin Capital/Citadel would have likely had high level conversations with MUST management before coordinating all this.\n\nIt's a win for MUST management who would have wanted out of their position at that unprecedented valuation. The ROI for them would have to be one of their biggest wins as a firm EVER.\n\nThis explains why closing on Jan. 27th was $347.51, and opening on Jan. 28th was $265. The agreed upon sale was probably within a certain range close to $265 per share.\n\nKeep in mind the retail investor was mostly locked out of purchasing the shares that sold near $265, meaning it would have been the hedge funds who were purchasing at that price.\n\nExhibit B) https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME\n\nI believe this was purposefully done so that Hedge fund A could purchase the shares with minimal interference from retail investors, thus the stock came directly from MUST management.\n\nOnce Hedge Fund A had possession of those 1.3 million shares they then closed out as many of their short positions as possible with their borrower.\n\nThe borrower could then turn around and sell the shares they were now in possession of at a reduced price to Hedge Fund B. \n\nHedge Fund B then went and closed out their short positions with their borrower.\n\nThey could rinse and repeat as much as needed to clear out as many shorts as possible, which is likely why the price went as low as $112.25 on Thursday. They kept coordinating the sale of the same shares back and forth all the while driving the price down minimizing their losses. \n\nAs soon as they were happy with the amount of short positions closed, the borrowers would then be able to return those shares to the retail investors/institutional longs they burrowed from in the first place.\n\nWho wins if this theory is even possible, AND is correct.\n\n1) The Hedge Funds. Melvin, and Citadel who messed up in the first place by over shorting this stock. They still lost billions upon billions of dollars, but they weren't completely wiped out, as they should have been, and they lived to fight another day. Both of these funds already moved to shore up their assets by having new money injected into their funds (the every next day!).\n\nIt's really, REALLY important to notice that they only transferred billions back into their funds once they knew their plan had succeeded. This limited the liability involved if they didn't pull off their plan, as the new capital would have been lost while either buying back their shorts, or going through bankruptcy.\n\n2) MUST management. Sold at unprecedented highs, at a likely agreed upon price. Basically no risk for them, while making a ton.\n\n3) The borrowers. If Melvin, and Citadel went bankrupt from their idiotic mistake, as they should have, it would have been the borrowers who would have had to buy back the shorted stocks. Losing billions in the process.\n\n4) The clearing houses. If Melvin, and Citadel could not pay for the shorts, and the borrowers could not pay for the shorts, it would have been the clearing houses who would have had to do it. Losing billions in the process.\n\n5) Robinhood, Interactive Brokers, Webull and TD Ameritrade likely colluded with the above parties as they have made billions of dollars off the Hedge Funds over the years, and now they will continue to do so, since those Hedge Funds are still active in the market.\n\nI don't know if much, or any of the above makes actual sense, or is even possible. Hopefully someone else who knows a bit more can provide feedback.",

            "comment": "Given what happened to GME today, I\u2019d like to add a few thoughts. People are questioning what next. There are many people holding the bag and I feel for you. However, I think we have a few possibilities from here:\n\n1) Remember robinhood still has large restrictions on GME. So like Mark Cuban has said, the demand for the stock has been curbed, it might be likely to see additional demand when all restrictions are lifted.\n\n2) Finra releases the numbers on Feb. 9th, and we don\u2019t need to speculate over SI being 50% or not, we can know the actual amount. Plus, I\u2019m sure there are additional shorts yesterday and today. What if the numbers are still over 100% ? Would there be additional demand for GME at that point ? \n\n3) Some say the short squeeze is over, if it is over, I don\u2019t think GME is a bad investment. Remember that ryan Cohen is an activist investor known for turning businesses around. He recognizes the need for a shift in the business model. I think the GME members realize it and are receptive to him. I think there\u2019s value to this, and I plan to buy more when there are discounts even if the short squeeze is over. Also, there is tremendous growth in the video game industry, and I think Ryan Cohen will be able to take advantage of this. I believe he is a smart investor and I certainly believe in him. \n\nI\u2019m personally holding at 152 per share and I would buy more as the dips continue perhaps when it goes to double digits. Remember that the stock did pop to Jan 11th, when the short squeeze wasn\u2019t announced. There are also additional fundamental analysis by u/DeepFuckingValue, and so although it certainly hurts to see these red days, I feel that there are reasons to keep the stock regardless of whether the squeeze is over or not. So think twice about cutting your losses.\n\nHowever, I did cut my losses for AMC, they have an EPS of -34 and I don\u2019t think I can argue for much value there. I\u2019d rather be invested in a company like Cinemax which only has an eps of -1.4ish. But I don\u2019t feel the same for GME.\n\nHappy to get other perspectives and insights as well.",

I can afford the loss, so I'm not going to lose sleep. I'm normally a passive investor (let the experts manage my money) so this whole thing was really unlike me to jump in.\n\nIt really did start to feel like a cult. We had our savior and messiah (DFV) and everything that went against the status quo was downvoted, called a bot, or a paid shill.  I was desperately looking for some real evidence to keep this going last night, but it all felt underwhelming. Having a family member that got deeply involved in qanon, I saw a lot of the same behaviors. \n\nThe one thing that always bothered me was that if this was such a no brainer, than there would've been WAY more people with big money that got in on the action. \n\nYou live you learn. I'm not going to complain about the system being fixed (although it does seem like some changes should be made) and that I got screwed. Need to do REAL research and have a good understanding what's going next time if I'm going to play the market and avoid the meme stocks. \n\nI feel very sad for people who jumped in with everything last week.",

One of its main debt holder also converted bond to stocks, then proceeded to sell the stocks. \n\nThis would suggest that liquidity isn't an issue for AMC and there wouldn't be a short squeeze coming. Based on that assumption, I have two questions. \n\n1. What if GME also issues stocks? Wouldn't that solve the problem for the shorts?\n\n2. If my assumption is correct, why do the charts of AMC and GME basically move in lock step the last few trading sessions? Is there actually significant SI on AMC as well?",

In the beginning it was the wild west, and it was crazy the kind of ways you could game the market.  Now I think it's harder, more expensive, and likely to land you in hot water with the SEC, but it is for sure in some peoples' back pockets for times when it is worth the potential fines.

I don't understand this. \n\nTake somebody like deepfucking value, he just though Gamestop was undervalued which it was at the price he bought it at, but now gamestop is overvalued because it got caught up in al the insane hype. Gamestop ATH before this was 60 some dollars. Maybe it's worth 100 dollars per share, but most likely not. \n\nSo deep fucking value turned 50 000 in to 25 - 50 million in like 2 years or so.\n\nWhy would he suddenly break away from his own value investing strategy and NOT sell? Makes no sense to me.  \n\nAlso let's talk Micheal J Burry from scion. Why on earth would he not have liquidated his 5% position yet? If his strategy is to buy undervalued stock his strategy is also to sell overvalued. For all we know he closed his position somewhere between 100 - 500, let it peak and opened a short position around 400. \n\nSo I don't really believe all those guys on wsb that tell everybody they are not selling. Most of them that are in the profit have obviously started to sell and know that it's in their benefit to tell people to hold and buy the dip so there is enough liquidity for them to get out while still in the green.\n\nIf I am up 100%, I might in certain conditions hold on to my position a little bit longer. But when I am up 10x let alone 100x or 1000x? No way, why even risk it? \n\nThe stock has clearly peaked, and will leave behind a big trail of losers that got in to late. \n\nIt's not really about taking down wall street, it's that all of us secretly would love to have their power and once we do we don't turn out to be much different ....",

But secondly he turned $50k into at one point $50MM in value. Regardless, he's a legend and probably has book deals and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year coming his way for years and years to come. He's fine.\n\nIt's a cult and a movement. It's the same reason you saw people storm the capitol. The last part of my own position in this is for this cause alone. I think as long as you understand you're engaging in cult like behavior that hopefully makes it a little better! lol.",

I know he has taken some profits off his options plays, and maybe he's still holding out hope for the squeeze because he can afford to, but giving up on 8 figures just to make 6 figures in deals isn't really an optimal value investing strategy.",

The hard bull case, which depends entirely on Ryan Cohen replicating the type of success he had with Chewy, is, believe it or not, on the order of $1000/share.  I'm not saying that's the likely outcome, but it's not as ridiculous as it may sound either.\n\nI tried to summarize in a comment I posted a while back shortly after I created this account because I saw what was like to happen with GME: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l48c2c/opinions_on_gme/gkn38fq/?context=3",

    "postText": "Years ago Paul Samuelson famously quipped, \"the stock market has predicted nine out of the last five recessions.\" Time marches on, yet some things remain the same. So far, no headwind has been strong enough to halt the bullish momentum - not inflation, not the debt ceiling drama, and not the Silvergate and SVB crashes. \n\nEven the tightening of the corporate real estate market doesn't seem to be enough to unnerve investors. So, should analysts concede they were mistaken, and that neither the economy nor the market faces imminent danger? Perhaps they underestimated the resilience of the \"buy the dip\" mentality?\n\nOf course, no one will admit such a thing outright. Instead, they attempt to validate their stance by presenting new grounds for a trend reversal. The newest harbinger of economic doom is now identified as the U.S. Treasury. The argument is that issuing more bonds, coupled with Quantitative Tightening (QT), should drive up T-bill yields and strain the financial system. At first glance, this claim seems plausible. Issuing around $1 trillion worth of notes could indeed further sap liquidity. The crux of the matter is whether the market can absorb all this new supply, and on this point, opinions diverge. \n\nSome maintain that there won't be sufficient bank reserves to accommodate it all, suggesting that the price of T-bills should fall sufficiently to offer a return above the Reverse Repo rate (RRP). Others contend that, while there will likely be a reshuffling of investor funds from one cash-like instrument to another, there will not be a removal from the market for any significant duration. \n\nOne thing I can agree with unequivocally is that this will invert the yield curve regardless. Does that mean the celebration is likely to continue? Until there's a **robust S&amp;P 500 breach of the 4300 level**, it's premature to anticipate a new bull market phase. Ultimately, however, I suspect the economic slowdown, coupled with high interest rates, will fulfill their historical roles.",

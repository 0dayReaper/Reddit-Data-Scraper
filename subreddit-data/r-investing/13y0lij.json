    "postText": "If growth and value typically take turns outperforming each other, would I be a good idea to just hold VIG and VUG instead of VOO or VTI? Are there benefits to holding the market when you can take the best of the growth and the value plays? I back tested this hypothesis as far back as I could and the VIG and VUG combo outperformed VTI by almost a full 1% CAGR. \n\nP.S. my current ira is split 25% VTI 25% VUG 12.5% SCHD 12.5% DGRO and 25% VXUS. I\u2019m 31. \n\nThoughts? Comments?",

            "comment": "If you for instance decide that you want 25% of each, you'll automatically invest in the ones that are lagging behind each time you invest money. So say VIG/VUG both went to 20%, and VOO/VTI to 30%, you would put more money into the former two funds which automatically does what you're asking for.\n\nI do this manually through a spreadsheet, but M1 Finance has an option to set these percentages. This way you always put more money towards funds that are the worst performers at that particular time.",

            "comment": "You need to see the time period. All the outperformance of VIG/VUG combo came after 2017. That too only 3 years excluding 2023. Before that the combo always trailed behind total market. Out of total 16 years of data the combo outperformed VTI for only 6 years. No one knows what is going to happen in the future. But holding total market will give you the escape from the question \u201cwhat if\u201d. Theoretically speaking most of the time small cap stocks outperforms large cap. Just holding large cap value and large cap growth is unlikely to outperform the total market, given the current high valuation of large cap stocks. For possibility of 1% outperformance I would not take the risk. Years of research always comes down to one conclusion. Total market investment is the safest and the best for majority of retail investor. Tilting your portfolio away from it most of the time will underperform.",

But most of your investment should be in total market. Deviate from it at your own risk. Remember VUG is not a great fund at all. It has major stakes in junk like Snapchat. If you want get a good blend, buy VOO. It will be a safer alternative to mixing VUG/VIG.",

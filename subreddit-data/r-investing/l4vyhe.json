    "postText": "Just a quick PSA, because we are not going to leave personalized comments on the dozens of threads getting nuked here, things that are being taken down: \n\n* WSB mods removed a thread on XYZ\n\n* I think WSB is manipulating stocks\n\n* WSB mods are not allowing discussion of [thing I want to discuss]\n\n* WSB mods are children and shut the sub down\n\n* anyone thinking /r/investing is the right venue to air out their thoughts on how bad it is that 12 year olds are gambling on Robinhood. \n\nWe just don't care, and we certainly are not going to be a venue for anyone to complain about the moderation of another subreddit.  If you have a disagreement with the mods of WSB then slide in to their DM and let them know (modmail, don't actually DM a mod, that's weird), or go to one of the subreddits like /r/subredditdrama that are dedicated to this sort of dumb shit, but don't post about it here because that'll be immediately removed.\n\nThis subreddit is for discussing investing, not for airing out disagreements with other subreddits.  I think I've nuked a dozen threads on this topic, and two people have already been banned for re-posting removed threads.\n\n**E: I don't know how but lot's of confused comments here, \"WSB Affairs\" means we don't want to see people here bitching about things that happen on that subreddit.  It does not mean we're preventing any discussion of any actual trade, investment, whatever.  \"GME up 70000% in premarket\" is a thread that get's to stay because it's an investment topic.  \"WSB mods did a thing I don't like\" is not, that's reddit drama.  Simple enough.**",

Say what you want but WSB has figured out how squeeze stocks that have been shorted by hedge funds and drive the stock price at the hedge funds expense. They\u2019ve proved the formula multiple times over so why not make a little play here or there and cash in. I\u2019d only put like $1,000 max in a call option just for fun but I can\u2019t lie what they\u2019ve been doing over there is intriguing. A bunch of bros banding together to fuck over the 1% to become part of the 1% is kind of poetic.",

Not many people can predict bubbles and most will end up sitting in the sidelines yelling 'The end is near' for a few years while the value of their dollars continue to depreciate. \n\nI studied the GFC heavily during my economics degree (because I happened to be doing the degree right after the '08 crash) and could see that almost all these overqualified 'geniuses' failed to predict anything and they spent their time after it happened try explain what went wrong.",

He lends it to Alice who sells it short to Lisa. She lends it to Bruce who sells it short to Jim. And so on...  \nWith that said, naked shorting (shorting without first locating and borrowing shares) is legal for options market makers under Regulation SHO, but illegal for others. https://nope-its-lily.medium.com/gamestop-power-to-the-market-players-part-1-d8863f2f8604  \n\nA short squeeze is when rising prices create pressure for short sellers to cover their shorts by buying back the shares, which causes the price to rise which causes more covering and so on. It can happen due to one or more of: margin calls/constraints, borrow interest, lack of borrowable shares.  \n\nGamma trap is when people buy calls and options market makers sell them and hedge their own exposure by buying shares. Initially they buy some number of shares, less than 100, equal to the option's delta. As the stock price rises, the delta also rises until it gets fairly in the money and plateaus at 100% (the rate of change in delta wrt stock price is called gamma). So they hedge their options by buying more shares, which again can lead to a feedback loop, at least until most of the options they've written are in the money and gamma becomes low.",

    "postText": "I'm kind of a fan of amusing alternative maybe-leading indicators. Before this one, the most amusing was the \"Fluffy Puppy\" indicator, which was [flashing red a short time ago (accompanied by cute puppy video)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fluffy-puppy-indicator-signaling-a-recession-162927588.html).\n\nToday, the indicator du jour is strip club traffic.\n\nhttps://www.indy100.com/viral/stripper-recession-empty-clubs\n\n&gt;Some strippers on Twitter said they think recession is guaranteed - because the strip clubs are suddenly empty.\n\n&gt;On Thursday (9 May), a woman who goes by @botticellibimbo on the platform said the following about the clubs: \"The strip club is sadly a leading indicator, and I can promise y'all we r in a recession, lmao.\"\n\n&gt;\"Me getting stock alerts just to decide whether it's worth it to go to work,\" she further wrote in a subsequent tweet.\n\n&gt;People took to the comment section of her post to confirm her sentiments about the strip clubs, as well as their own experiences in other industries that seemed to be declining.\n\n&gt;\"Nah fr, reading all these articles journalists and economists are like we're not in a recession we might not even get one this year or next\u2026like the club is dead babe wym,\" one wrote.\n\n&gt;[more]\n\n\nedit: added the fact that the video associated with the fluffy puppy indicator does in fact include puppies.",

Alas idk that RV's are as good of an indicator of incoming recessionary pressure because of the long lead times for production or RV's (time to order vs time to delivery can be 2 years) and the fact that RV customers tend to have more financial stability so they dont just up and cancel orders for RV's.\n\nIf we see a decline in RV sales I would fully expect it to manifest sometime in 2023 when the current log or orders is filled and no new ones have been made.",

But I grew up in Portland OR and many of my friends became strippers - it is a huge part of the economy here. We have to most clubs per capita of any city in the country. Or at least we did at one point if not still.\n\nWhat I have heard from dancers are that there are, typically, groups of certain professions that come in. This includes wealthy businessmen, but also people coming through in the military, athletes, and other types. There are regulars too.\n\nI think that most of these groups (non-regulars) come in sort of seasonally. But, seeing them less would make sense as an economic indicator.\n\nBut, if we were to actually believe this, we would have to accept that going to strip clubs is considered less of a necessity than other \"party\" commodities (alcohol, cruises, marijuana etc) that can also be tracked. Why wouldn't we look there first unless strip clubs are the least necessary for people's day-to-day? It's logical and you can argue it but we would have to accept that for this theory to make sense.",

    "postText": "My dad has been working at a company for over 12 years and his 401k contributes into Fidelity Freedom 2020 Fund, I've been helping him with retirement planning as he is planning to retire in the next couple years\n\nJust from googling this fund, it has a lifetime -16.33% growth, why would anyone want a fund that has lifetime negative growth? According to his fidelity account he has lost over $25,000\n\nIn 2000, this fund was around $17, now in 2023 it is $13.50, and has never broken $20\n\nIsn't a 401k expected to grow around 4-6% a year?",

They pay their dividends, so he is likely not down in absolute terms.\n\n2) this fund has drawn down particularly sharply because the bond market got hit harder than anytime since the Great Depression over the last 2 years. If he\u2019s still working, he can likely afford to sit around for 2 years or so for it to recover. Since this is a mostly bond fund, the price *should* recover a bit if interest rates fall. If interest rates remain elevated, then that loss will probably stick. \n\n\nThe period 2000-2022 was a bad, bad time to be in bonds. The bond market went way down, and stayed down for a long time. That prevented funds like these from capturing good yields, which they rely on to generate income instead of price appreciation",

Not as much as an S&amp;P fund, but then again, the fund your dad chose is much more conservative, so that makes sense.  Factoring contributing around 10k each year to the fund, you end up with considerably more.  You can try it yourself, just make sure to check the reinvest dividends option.\n\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio",

And at the moment it sounds like that one is way down and not very good.\n\nYou can either move them to different funds, or wait and hope it comes back. I do not know the future, nor anything about that specific fund so it's anyone's guess. Research why it is down, and if it's likely to reverse anytime soon.",

A portion of it is going into Vanguard Target Retirement 2050. It was growing for several years, but then sometime around last year they switched the fund automatically? I think it went from the normal fund to the investor share fund, or vice versa- something like that. They traded out of one and into the other without me  doing anything, and since it was tax deferred it didn't incur anything. When I look at it now, it says that it has losses, but that is only because the fund was switched.\n\nCould it be that something like that happened?",

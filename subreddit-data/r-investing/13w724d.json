Are there investments I can buy that will make money when interest rates are high/rising?\n\nWhen they drop, the investments will lose money but then i can refinance my mortgage",

A lot of the 5+% rates are callable from 2024+, but you can lock in the rates for at least 6 months, so even if HYSAs start to go down, you\u2019ll get some short term benefit. I just put in an order for the 5.4% 2024 JPMorgan.",

I have a platinum savings account with CIT which gives 4.85% for a HYSA and also see 5% CD rates for 6months to 1 year at many banks. Is there a reason I would not want to do a 1 year or longer CD if I don't need the money?",

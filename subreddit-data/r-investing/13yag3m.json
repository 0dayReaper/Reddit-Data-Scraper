    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI've been considering investing in a photovoltaic facility as a means of generating passive income (so not for own consumption). However, before diving in, I wanted to hear from those who have first-hand experience in this field. I have a few questions and would greatly appreciate any insights you can provide:  \n\n\n1. Do you currently own or have invested in a photovoltaic facility and what has been your experience with it in terms of generating passive income?\n2. Is it a reasonable investment option in terms of long-term returns?\n3. What are some key factors to consider before investing in a photovoltaic facility?\n4. Are there any potential challenges or risks involved that one should be aware of?\n5. Additionally, I'm interested in exploring stocks related to the photovoltaic industry. If you have any recommendations or insights on promising stocks in this sector, I would love to hear them.\n\nThank you all in advance for your valuable input and advice.",

            "comment": "If you are investing in a photovoltaic facility, you will make no money.\n\nFirst, to repeat another users' point: strangers aren't going to cut you in on a great deal. They are only \"cutting you in\" because you will give them money as an \"investment\".\n\nSecond, a \"photovoltaic facility\", is just a power plant - and a weak one at that. It produces electricity. Despite sounding high-tech and futuristic, the electricity it produces doesn't sell for any more than the electricity produced at a coal plant. The margins are not great. \n\nAny company that has built a solar power plant doesn't need an investment from some random retail investor. If they are offering an \"investment opportunity\" it's because they think a bunch of individual retail investors will cut them $10,000 checks in return for basically nothing.\n\nSo no, this is not a good source of passive income.",

Those that doesn't have credible finances or actual promise has no choice but to seek private investors happy to gamble on a 1/10 000 chance to get paid (and they want a lot higher returns then banks, not lower).\n\n\nAnd when it comes to private investors they want *as few as possible, and as rich as possible* to limit the risk. Joe Random like you, me or OP might not have the balls to wait for 10-15 years to get our money back. Heck, maybe we can't do it..life happens. While Musk, Bezos or Gates can easily lend you $ 1 000 000 without blinking and if it all goes to flame they'll hardly notice.",

For a facility &lt; 100kWp a compensation of 10.9 \u20acct / kWh is guaranteed based on the EEG2023 law in germany for 20 years for a given installation. I'll have to  calculate it through to see the expenses vs. potential income, but I need to make some assumptions. Thats why I wonder if someone already did something similar",

They won't consider a royalty based scheme.   \n\nHow is this relevant to an investor?  The same pressures that make the landowner not get much cause the project itself to be marginal.\n\nThe problem is that solar electricity may be cheap, on paper,  but then the overheads and regulatory burdens start piling up, and utilities really don't want to accommodate community solar that feeds in power whenever it wants to.\n\nIt seems basically driven by subsidies and renewable mandates, unless you build *big* in a sunny place that's ready to incorporate it into the grid.  And at that point, little people don't get a buy in.\n\nIf this had worked for me, it would have been \"Yeah!  The state forces the utility to buy solar, and I'm the lucky one leasing land for it and getting money for somewhat overpriced power.\"\n\nThere's was a big backlog of people who wanted to buiild (at subsidized or mandated rates), relative to what the utility would take.    The hard part was connecting to the grid.\n\nSolar stocks and investing in large scale solar utilities is another matter.",

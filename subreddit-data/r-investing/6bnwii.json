Moore's law is about the amount of transistors able to fit in a given area, so it doesn't even necessarily translate to improved computing power. It means more computing power per square inch, but afaik that's it.\n\n\nWe aren't really held back in AI by the number of transistors per chip anymore. AI uses extremely parallel processing with tons of data. Better algorithms, more cores, cheaper processors, and more data will lead to better AI. ",

Let's say they don't innovate much, then what do consumers do? I doubt they'd leave Amazon because like I said, the service can't be matched. If any competitor comes up with something drastic to make people even consider switching, no one will until their prime is up, and by then Amazon would have already adapted their service to match that competitor.

Which will provide relief to one of the largest complaints regarding Walmart: the long checkout lines.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon can only dream of \"no-checkout\" stores, because they have no stores.  And they had to delay the opening of their Amazon Go store because their tech wasn't working (I personally don't believe Amazon deserves the recognition of being a tech company).\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-go-grocery-store-opening-delayed-due-to-technical-issues-2017-3\n\nWalmart's hired a lot of talented devs to improve their site and apps.  They've invested in automation and \"robotics\" (everyone's favorite buzzword) in their logistic centers.  And Marc Lore is blood thirsty to destroy Amazon.  I'm buying as many walmart shares as I can.  ",

They never grew up in a technological savvy environment so they don't know how to use technology to it's full potential.\n\nMeanwhile, me and my [gen-z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z) friends use Amazon for everything we need (besides groceries) simply because it's more convenient in a lot of cases.\n\nI predict Amazon will continue to grow economically along with generation z (age wise).\n\nUnless Walmart starts innovating, they'll begin to die along with all\nthe un-savvy old people still on IE 8.

As to ordering groceries on Amazon, in London (where I live), along with a few other big UK cities they partnered with one of the four big supermarkets to provide you with 2 hour delivery of almost all groceries. A minimum order of \u00a320 but nothing on top of that, other than the tip. I think that if Walmart was to utilise their existing huge infrastructure, they can seriously compete with Amazon, both when it comes to stuff that Amazon normally provides (electronics, books etc) and of course groceries.",

You could bet that it continues its astronomical growth, but as soon as a quarterly report comes out that hints to them slowing down, opinion might change, and there might be a hell of a lot of people trying to sell.

Most armchair investors look at the price and ask themselves, will the price go up (consulting their crystal ball, of course)? Whereas real investors find out how much money a company will currently be paying them, the value of the company's future cash flows, and the likelihood of this event continuing, and put money to work based on this. \n\nWhen Tesla reports earnings and the company stock price increases by 20% overnight, has the value of the company magically increased in a corresponding way? Of course not. Because nothing about the business has really changed.  The company price is 100% headline-driven. Let's not confuse valuation with value of cash flows or assets\n\nToyota has only twice the market cap of Tesla, yet produces 13,000 times the profit",

It wasn't the intrinsic value of the company that would have made you the money resulting from the 20% increase in tesla's stock price was it?\n\nYes, we all understand that if you are going to invest in a company long term, you should invest in companies that have a high intrinsic value, rather than basing it on the current stock price, because those companies are more likely to have continuous stock price increases. This doesn't change the fact that there is not a perfect correlation between intrinsic value and stock price, and stock price is ultimately what you are chasing when you invest.\n\nEDIT: To put it in other words, it's certainly possible for a stock price to increase dramatically over the period of time I have money invested in it, completely independent from the shitty intrinsic value of the company (i.e. tesla) I'm invested in. So in that case, I made money despite the intrinsic value, so clearly intrinsic value can be completely irrelevant in certain cases.",

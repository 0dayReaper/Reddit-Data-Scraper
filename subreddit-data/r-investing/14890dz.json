    "postText": "Hi all,\nSo TBill auctions are held weekly on Thursdays and funds don't settle until the following Tuesday. Say one bought 1mo TBill on 5/4/23 (auction), the real date which you get the bond is 5/9. The bond doesn't pay its coupon until 6/6. However, you'd need to wait until that Thursday, 6/8, to buy the TBill again. That means in these ladders, there is a 1 week delay which you are losing out on interest. Am I right in this regard? Is there a way to ladder it so that there is no period of no interest?\n\n\nThanks.",

The account will show a negative cash balance until the previous T-bill matures, but I believe Schwab still allows the order to be placed as long as the (Schwab-estimated?) cost of the order is less than the cash that would be available by settlement, accounting for any T-bills that are maturing.",

They also have a reinvest option so that you never miss any interest. Of course, then your bills are held at treasurydirect and you can\u2019t transfer them to a broker for 45 days.",

                    "comment": "If OP is going to hold the T-bills until maturity, and not sell them on the secondary market, then keeping them ini Treasury Direct (TD) shouldn't be too much of a pain. The proceeds at re-investment can be directed to an account outside of TD on an individual T-bill basis, so they can be used in activities outside of TD upon maturity. For example, OP buys an 8-week ($1k face value, $995 cost) with funds directly from their checking account; funds ($995) are removed from checking at T-bill issue; 8 weeks later, funds are reinvested in another T-bill ($1k face value, $994 cost) but the difference ($6) is deposited in the checking account. (I don't know what that yield rate would be. I just WAGed those numbers for an example.)\n\nI've laddered T-bills through TD and get deposits to my checking every Tuesday (or Friday before the issue for some Monday holidays). It's straightforward and automatic and it never skips a week. \n\nHTH",

Anyone want to chime in if I did it right? Should I drop some of the ETF if it seems redundant? What should I do different if I want to be a littler more aggressive? TIA",

            "comment": "You\u2019re basically recreating VOO with more steps and less efficiency. The covariance between VOO and all your funds combined is probably very high. Invest in VOO and call it a day. \n\nIf you actually want to diversify there are international funds (VXUS/VEA/VWO), momentum funds (QMOM/MTUM/VFMO), small cap value (AVUV/VIOV), long term nominal bonds (EDV), long term TIPS (LTPZ), managed futures (DBMF/KMLM), gold (SGOL).\n\n\nIn order to be more aggressive you can tilt towards small cap value (highest risk/highest reward investments) or create an all weather like portfolio and leverage the whole thing via margin. Both approaches have their risks and are not meant for novices so definitely DYOR before even thinking of going into this realm.",

Your sharpe and sortino ratios are worse than VOO. This does not account for fees, which are worse than VOO. Anyone arguing that the S&amp;P 500 does not provide adequate diversification for the lay investor should be ignored. If you're running a hedge fund then that answer is different, but this is /r/investing, we're not doing that here. \n\nPersonally, my entire 401k is in the S&amp;P 500 and my IRA is in some very different stuff that I play around with and usually don't clear a lot of money on. It scratches the itch to play with stocks but not in financially detrimental way.",

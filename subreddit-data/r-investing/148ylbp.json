    "postText": "Sorry if this isn't the right sub, I'm kinda desperate. \nI recently turned 18 and now have the rights to retrieve the money from my Primerica account. My mom has been putting money into it since 2016 for me either to buy a car or use for college. Well I absolutely need this money for college and we have been trying to get it for the last few months. It's been hell working trying to get it. Sure it was sooo easy putting money in, but trying to actually get it, that's a whole nother story. We've had our account manager come to our house twice to help but it's clear she doesn't know what she's doing. The banks require quarterly statements for proof of ownership but when we go online to my account to retrieve the statements it says we can't access them. When talking to anyone on the phone to receive them, they can't give them to us. We are at a loss and I need this money soon. It feels so scammy and my mom is so mad because she worked hard for this money for me. No one can help us or has successfully helped us for the last few months. It feels as though I'll never get my money.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am from Central-eastern Europe and I want to start investing in ETFs. Unfortunately we have limited number of ETF available in my stockbroker's office. I want to have majority of my saving in relatively safe investment however I am willing to take some risk. Let me know what do you think about ETFs like QQQ3, IUIT, VWRL. If you have in mind some different ETFs I will check if I can buy them. Also I don't want to change stockbroker right now since I am starting my investment journey and here I have good advisory regarding taxes/local stock etc\nThank you for your help in advance.",

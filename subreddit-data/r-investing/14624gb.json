    "postText": "I was recently feeling some regret about taking a trip to Greece with my wife. It was very fun, but we ended up staying longer and doing more things than we initially planned, spending about $10k total,  way over initial budget by quite a lot. We just lost track of our budget in the blur of fun. As a result, I had to cut back on retirement contributions this year and I was not happy about it. I kept obsessing over what that 10k might have been 20 years from now, had I invested it instead. But then I had a conversation with a close childhood friend.\n\nThis friend's father retired last year having lived the life of a frugal teetotal. He was obsessed with finance and investing. He read every book on the subject that he could and was extremely knowledgeable. I remember him giving my own father advice. He worked at a few different state agencies starting in his mid 20s and continued right up into his early 60s, ending with a low six figure salary. Throughout this time he was extremely frugal and retired with several million in various retirement accounts.\n\nMy friend was telling me that growing up, his father never took them on trips, took them out to a fancy restaurant only once a year, bought used/hand-me-down items instead of new things whenever possible, never drank, and in general just did not spend a dime on entertainment. They had board games in the house, and that was about it. I asked him what his favorite memories were of his childhood, and he couldn't really say. In other words, no memories really stood out among the sea of blandness.\n\nI think you know what happens next.\n\nJust one year after his father retired: BAM. Alzheimer's. Rapid onset. He now has severe dementia and will probably die in the next year or two.\n\nThe one thing his father did talk about a lot was that he always wanted to see Europe. Greece, Italy, and England in particular. Now that is not possible. He will die never having left the country. He hardly even travelled outside of his own state.\n\nListening to my friend describe his father's situation was sobering. Investing is, of course, a wise decision. But it should never come at the expense of experiences.\n\nRetirement-aged people can and do have fun. But lets be real. Do you see a lot of 60+ people backpacking through Cambodia? Going bungee jumping? Going to a rave? Taking a cab home at 2 am after a night of drinking with friends? The reality is that the types of fun you can have dwindle as you age. Going to Spain at 58 is not the same as going at 28.\n\nA final thought I had was that life is meant to be a party, a celebration. And at this party, who is the most interesting person to talk to: The guy explaining his 30 year process of accumulating 10 million in his bank account or the guy talking about his experience riding four wheelers amid ancient ruins on a Greek island? My post-Greece regret is gone. I'd spend that $10k again in a heartbeat.",

Saving for retirement will still mean I\u2019ll be able to retire.  Yes, it may not be when I\u2019m 50 but it will still happen.  But there\u2019s also things to be gained from not dumping literally everything into savings.  Those trips, dinners, and other things that could easily be claimed as wastes of money are investing into something more important.  Memories, experiences and relationships.  Those are important investments too.  When I become financially independent, I don\u2019t want to say \u201cNOW is when my life really begins.\u201d  You gotta find a way to enjoy the whole ride.",

Sure if we\u2019re talking tens of millions it\u2019s possible, but for most people it\u2019s a million or two at most, usually much less. That\u2019s not enough for 40+ years of life unless you\u2019re extremely financially disciplined, and people who haven\u2019t already built some wealth are not, as it\u2019s a skill only learned by starting small and growing. In your scenario, you could take 5 years off and do stuff, but the money will run out, You\u2019ll spend it like crazy without realizing how fast you\u2019re spending it, and one day it\u2019s gone. By then, you have completely lost the instinct to make stuff others want to pay you for, and have gotten used to doing stuff you want. \n\nThat\u2019s why most smart parents give their kids their money when they\u2019re already built some wealth, they\u2019ve gotten used to having money to buy whatever they want and yet resisting to do so.\n\nHuman psychology is just like that with everything. For example, imagine someone who been working out for a few months or a year, if you put them in a place without a gym and they\u2019ll just stop working out. You take a gym rat who hasn\u2019t missed a gym day in 15 years, put them somewhere without a gym, they\u2019ll go and find some heavy rock to exercise with. Habits need are built starting small and over a long time. Financial habits are not different. Giving a young person a lot of money is effectively stopping the development of their financial habits, and creating very bad ones in their place.",

That means some people never mature in that area for various reasons. Sometimes parents put their kids through most of those events, and sometimes they don\u2019t. \n\nThis is mainly why you see some grown adults blow away windfalls in a flash. Some of them never had enough income to have savings and always operated by making spending whatever they got this month and worry about future later. Or some rich kids who\u2019s parents didn\u2019t artificially create financial limitations blow away their inheritance the moment parents die. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to criticize your point specifically, for all we know you might do it all right. I\u2019m just saying on average people don\u2019t. I know a lot of people who fucked up and only one who didn\u2019t. Now again, not criticizing you or your plan specifically, but using your scenario as an example, what you say is exactly what everyone would say, that they\u2019d be responsible and all. I\u2019ve seen and heard it every time. But once those 0s hit your bank account,, or \u201cget punched in the mouth\u201d as Mike Tyson puts it, your entire plan goes out the window. You\u2019ll have a \u201cah fuck it, it\u2019s just a $1k just this one time\u201d once a month, then once a week, and then it\u2019ll become habit. \n\n\nIt\u2019s very normal and human, and I hardly consider it a failure tbh(I do consider it a failure on the part of whoever gave them the money, without preparing the recipient first). Expecting someone who\u2019s never had a lot of money, handle sudden riches well is like expecting someone who never trained for it to just casually go run a half marathon. There are humans who can do it, but they\u2019re an exceptions",

Once I got a corporate job I went on a spree and bought nearly every single material thing I had ever wanted (I had had a spreadsheet brewing for a couple of years at that point), a new mattress/bedding, a decent office chair to replace the old shitty one I'd had for close to a decade, a couple of nice mechanical watches, clothes, shoes, furniture, computer parts (I replaced my 8 year old homebrew with a new i9, RTX 3080Ti based system, with terabytes of SSD storage and an ultrawide monitor- it cost $8k in all), audio equipment, etc. I spent over $40k in one year, not including rent or other stuff. I still saved 15% of pre-tax income for retirement. \n\nThe improvement to my day to day life has been immense. I sleep better, I do my job better, I feel mentally so much better. It would have been totally wasted on a few nice vacations in foreign spots. I bought things that are quality and will last me years, like my Steelcase Gesture chair/Pottery Barn furniture.\n\nI went from a squeaky, flaking-off seat chair from Staples that I hated every minute of and now I have a chair that doesn't hurt my back and has a 12 year warranty and a reputation of lasting much longer. It was $1600, which to a lot of people seems exorbitant, but it's cheaper over the long run. The watches I bought have all increased in value and I could unload them at a profit if I needed to. People think I'm stupid for buying these things, but they bring me joy. \n\nNow I am focused on getting a down payment for a house together. For a 24 year old, I think I am doing just fine. But my relatives constantly make snide comments about how much they think I spend.",

My ability to get that mortgage or pay for my kid's first car, or whatever, is the sum total of the decisions I make now with what job to take and how to organize the money I get from it. \n\nThose decisions that I saw friend's families have to make, moving because they can't afford the town anymore, or whatever, that's real life. No one's checking over you every month to make sure that you're living in a consistent way with what you expect the future to be. That's all on you.\n\nFor an over planner and over thinker like me, it genuinely scared the shit out of me and made me so cheap throughout my 20s. Once my retirement accounts were over $200k, I kind of convinced myself I was doing ok and could start having fun.\n\nBut the idea of being broke, of losing my job, of not making mortgage payments, fucking frightens me still. Not to get political, but in the US we don't have much of a safety net, I feel like the market could swallow me whole out of nowhere.",

So it is real that you can outlive your money and that fear is real..\n\nNOW that being said...\n\nThe older I get the advice I give you is all about the appreciation I develop as I age in the Ying-Yang symbol.  The feeling of opposite forces that have to coexist and meet somewhere in the middle.  That really is life.  The older you get the more you appreciate that symbol.  Finances and its effect on your life is the same.  My advice.  Take saving and investing serious.  BUT find the stuff you and family find important and put money aside for that.  Spending money on family memories sound reasonable to me.   \n\nAs I said you will find life is all about that Yin-Yang symbol.   As you get older you will find out the same thing.",

Imagine being evicted while you\u2019re dying of cancer at 85 years old. Save first, party later, possibly die in the process. I can promise you it\u2019s better than the alternative",

Personally i rather retire later and keep taking every 3rd year off to slow-travel. It's surprisingly affordable when you rent out your home and rent furnished places in 1 month increments.

Growing up we never visited anywhere. I can count on one hand the states I\u2019ve been to and most of that is just passing through them to get to a specific place. We would have one vacation every other year to the country my parents were from and that would be it. My poor mom begged my dad to go on vacation as a family to fun places, answer was always no. My mom died a few years back with cancer and now my dad is retired. Only recently over a few drinks did my dad finally admit he had been wrong and his greatest regret in life is how he didn\u2019t take my mom to the places she wanted to visit when she was still alive.\n\nInvesting is important, something I value extremely.

Instead of seeing orcas maybe once in a lifetime, i see them multiple times a year.  I see my favourite wildlife regularly, i enjoyed world class beaches as my backyard for over a decade, and had so many incredible life experiences.\n\nI can't afford to do the europe tour, and we only bought our condo in Vic 4 years ago.  We experienced housing insecurity whichwas a stress i never imagined I'd have to deal with. This summer our \"vacation\" will be going to vancouver for 2 nights to see a concert.  \n\nBut on weekends we can drive to more ecological destinations people travel from across the world to see.  I can't do the europe tour maybe ever, but my life since moving here has been so much better than we could have accomplished living in ontario full time.\n\nAt the end of the day, what is life but a collection of experiences?",

There are other fun places that they can go to for good return on investment of their money and they only spend like a fraction of the cost, they will still have great memories from it. Quite frankly European countries are overrated, it\u2019s just a bunch of buildings and they charge a lot for not such memorable experiences just so you can check it off some bucket list. The hotels are usually tiny, even double beds mean you get like these tiny beds to sleep on, the people are kind of cheap, they charge for water and the bathroom. Like just such cheap countries. If not for the clean water and not usually having to worry about malaria and other infectious diseases they will be inferior to other travel countries. I would think that it\u2019s just all due to marketing, there\u2019s nothing special about European countries, they don\u2019t even have the best landscapes in the world. Just buildings and marketing like when you\u2019ve seen the nth town with some over look cathedral and some palace and a marketplace it\u2019s like just all clones of each other, really boring even after two weeks.",

The reality is that the types of fun you can have dwindle as you age. Going to Spain at 58 is not the same as going at 28.\n\nIt's not the same, but it's not worse, either. I backpacked through Europe in my teens and 20's, stayed in youth hostels, and ate a lot of cheese sandwiches. And did a lot of walking. It was pretty awesome.\n\nWhen my mom went to Europe at around the same time, she stayed in nice hotels, had really good meals, and got around a lot by taxis. \n\nWhen my grandmother went to Europe, also at around the same time, she stayed in extremely fancy hotels and ate in very nice Michelin starred restaurants.\n\nI *promise you*, they did not miss bungie jumping, going to raves, or backpacking through Cambodia. \n\n&gt; Investing is, of course, a wise decision. But it should never come at the expense of experiences.\n\n\"Never\" is just an excuse not to invest. Investing means spending less than you make, which means giving up the possibility of *some* experiences. \n\nThis all pretty much seems like a strawman argument, as I haven't seen anyone on this sub arguing for an extremely frugal lifestyle to maximize investing. \n\n&gt;or the guy talking about his experience riding four wheelers amid ancient ruins on a Greek island?\n\nThis guy is less interesting than he imagines himself to be, actually. \n\nAnd coming home from a bar at 2 and going to raves aren't particularly expensive.",

They might be into sports, games, hell, even the work/job they do ect. Some hobbies, activities, and interest are more expensive to substain than others. If you can be happy with less, you can live a very fulfilling and happy life on the cheap.

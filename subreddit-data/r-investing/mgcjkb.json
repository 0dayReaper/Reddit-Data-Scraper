No taxes apply as this is considered an equivalent exchange at the current market value.\n\n6 months from now, I want to exchange my 20 good boy points for USD again, but the value on good boy points went up.  Now, I can sell my 20 good boy points for $1,500 USD.  I am liable for $500 USD in capital gains.\n\nJust think of currency as another form of security.  You only owe gains when you sell, and there are threshold limits to avoid short term conversion nonsense.  Most currencies won't change in value significantly enough for this to be relevant in the most common scenario of exchanging for local currency during vacation.",

For example, if a restaurant sets up their menu and prices right now when BTC is around 60k, and they charge 0.001 BTC for a fancy steak (i.e. 60$). Now imagine, within a month BTC dumps to 20k, do you expect the restaurant to charge the same 0.001 BTC i.e. $20? or imagine if BTC rises further to a 100k, do you again expect the restaurant to charge the same 0.001 BTC i.e. $100?\n\nProbably not. USD is the standard currency at the moment. Maybe in the future, when or if BTC becomes the standard, we will see the opposite happening.",

They're all way too unstable to ever be trusted as real currencies. A customer could buy a product from you for 10% more then what they'd have paid elsewhere, but by the time you try to spend the Bitcoin it could have lost 20% of it's value in just a few hours, causing you to have suddenly sold something at a loss. No competent businessman is ever going to want to deal with that kind of unnecessary risk, especially if their own country's currency isn't highly unstable.",

That may have been an early vision of Satoshi's of what bitcoin was going to be, but it became apparent a long time ago that bitcoin was not going to fill that role. The lack of privacy alone completely nullified it as a real decentralized currency (among other things). If you want an actual functioning currency in the crypto space, Monero is the only coin that fills that role. If you read Satoshi's early bitcoin writings, it much more closely resembles monero at this stage than it does bitcoin. \n\nSo pretending bitcoin is still a currency is incredibly silly. It hasn't been that for a long time. And honestly, that is ok. There is room in the world for a decentralized store of value. That alone is an idea worth pursuing. \n\nAll these \"pay with bitcoin\" vendors are gimmicks and the only people that really get excited about them are either shills or fools. But ultimately it's not really a big deal that these payment processors aren't using bitcoin as a real currency and are just converting to usd because that's no longer bitcoins purpose. It's not why investment firms are starting to hold bitcoin. It's not why the vast majority of holders are still holding bitcoin. Again, that ship has sailed a long long time ago. If the currency aspect interests you, Monero is where you should be looking because it works fantastically in that regard.\n\nBitcoin has its own value as a decentralized store of value and large scale wealth transfer system. It does this just fine without needing to pretend to be a currency. Unfortunately people are still pretending it's a currency and that makes it valuable, which again hasn't been true for a long time. Which is why it also isn't a big deal. Because no one who's been in this space for any amount of time still believes that's the goal of bitcoin anymore.",

That may be lame, but I don't necessarily agree it's not a good decentralized block chain storage implementation. Sure, other chains may \"do it better\" in that you think their programming has better ideas, but no chain does it better in terms of sheer computing power, which is a valuable asset when it comes to network security.\n\nI don't disagree that bitcoin is largely behind the curve when it comes to what cryptocurrencies can be. It was first, it is what sprung all the other ideas, so naturally ones that came later improved on the flaws of bitcoin. Like I said, it doesn't even do it's original intention of being a currency very good (despite people pretending like this paypal crap actually utilizes crypto in any meaningful way, because it doesn't). There's literally only one coin in the entire crypto sphere that currently works as a currency, and that coin (monero) has gone largely under the radar during this entire bull run. So that just shows how rational the crypto market is. Hype and pumping rule the day, you're not wrong in that. That also doesn't seem very different to the current market as a whole. It's just the times we live in.\n\nDoes all that mean bitcoin has no value? I don't know. Again as dumb as it may sound, name recognition carries a lot of weight. Bitcoin is the first place anyone new to crypto goes. It is the place where the big guns (hedge funds, banks, and the like) are dipping there toes. So as a speculative diversification tool, it seems to have value. It also acts as a sort of central currency for all the other cryptos to trade in and out of, which also has value in the cryptosphere. If you want to get into other cyrpto currencies, the easiest way is often to purchase bitcoin first. Although this avenue is beginning to open up as other cryptos gain mainstream acceptance.",

Exchanges have to follow KYC laws. Now Bitcoin is P2P. You and I can trade Bitcoin openly without anyone's permission. As long as the wallet you use for P2P transaction is not the same you use for exchanges then it can not be linked to you as a person. \n\nSo at this point it is on you to be honest and pay the IRS taxes on bitcoin that can not be linked to you. I an not recommending tax evasion. Just giving a very brief explanation. \n\nAs far as anyone knows that P2P wallet that is not linked to your identity via an exchange or on the blockchain can be located anywhere in the world and there is no way to tell who owns it. \n\nNow you could always lose your bitcoin in a boating accident. Be safe out there folks.",

To me it boils down to why would someone use an asset that can appreciate in value and acts as an \"inflation hedge\" (if you believe that argument) to then buy a good or service that will not appreciate in the same way as bitcoin and is not an inflation hedge. The incentive is to hold said speculative asset then, instead of giving up potential appreciation. BofA had a research report saying that 95% of BTC is owned by 2.6% of wallets, so from a technical POV bitcoin as a currency is kinda impractical.",

But then lack of supply of said alternate currency starts to drive up it's prices. Then after the price of the alternate currency soars enough people start to buy the alternate currency as an investment. Then sooner or later no one is using the alternate currency as a currency anymore, everyone is just hoarding it as an investment in hopes of selling it for even more money later. \n\nAt that point people tend to realize that the alternate currency is worthless if no one is spending it like a currency anymore, and the only people with it are investors who hope to sell it at an even higher price in the future. This usually causes it's value to drop to zero almost almost overnight, at which point the alternate currency is dead because people already stopped treating it as a currency and stopped spending it or accepting it as a form of currency.",

There are no transaction fees but there will be a bid-ask spread. PayPal functions as a middleman and will collect this spread, or accumulate bitcoin if they choose.  Perhaps better for the consumer to convert the bitcoin to fiat  first, and buy stuff as usual.\nBut I understand that a big following just needs bitcoin to be currency.",

It also has \"large\" but essentially fixed fees for transacting. There is only about 1mb worth of transactions that can be stored every 10 minutes (about 4.6transactions a second). For your transaction to be verified, you need to pay a fee (or a reward if it makes more sense) along side your original transaction to make it a sweeter deal for miners to put your transaction inside the block to be mined because then they get all those fees as well as the newly minted btc.\n\nWhat does this mean practically?\n\nIt means that at the moment, due to block size bitcoin is not good at transactions that are small and it cannot do them fast and cannot do alot of them. This is by design at the moment and there are many different ways to scale and there is also a good reason why it hasn't been scaled yet.\n\nWhat bitcoin is excellent for and destroys the current banks at the moment is for large transactions. If you are in the US and want to send say a million dollars to international countries , heck even to the neighbors in Canada, it takes along time and the bank fees are massive compared to btc. Remember the btc fees are mostly fixed and practically do not increase with amount sent. You sending a $100 or $10million worth of btc would be same fee and it would take 10 minutes. The banks cannot do this for that low of a fee (or rather won't ) and definitely will give your trouble if you are sending it to a some of countries like Russia, china etc. BTC is censorship resistant and works 24/7. \n\nI was actually recently in a position where I had to send $10k to a friend for a down payment and we did it is through btc and the fees were under $20 while the bank charged $50, and since it was the weekend I would have to wait 2 days minimum and he needed the cash like that day. \n\nThis is where btc is great at. It will be there also for smaller transactions but that will take time. It will get easier to use too but that will also take time. We are probably minimum 10 years out from it being anywhere close to viable to use it as a transactional currency for everyday things (coffees etc), but it's utility now is more in larger transactions where it already outperforms current systems. \n\n\nIt is also a store of value because it is designed to be finite and thus it is a potential really good hedge against inflation just like gold. That's why it is compared to gold alot because it is similar (at the moment) to gold also in it's capability to transact. Gold sucks for buying coffee but larger transactions could be done in it, it is just that btc is far superior and it has the ability to eventually scale to do small transactions since it is highly dividable.",

Buying thru PayPal totally defeats this purpose. Combine this with the fact that the value of Bitcoin can deviate up to 10 %or more in a day, and there appears to be no advantage of purchasing anything with Bitcoin through PayPal\n\nBitcoin is a speculative investment and if you know the risks go ahead and buy.

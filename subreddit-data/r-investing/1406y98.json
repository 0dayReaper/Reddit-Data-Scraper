My actual annual income is not something that worries due to my confidence in sales and that I have 15k in savings for the cold months of the market. I currently have a portfolio worth 55k and do like my positioning or anything, realistically 15% of my investments will stay and 85% will be liquidated and rolled over into sectors and individual stocks. If you were in my position and had 45-50k to invest fresh anywhere in the market where would you go? I'm looking to go with a medium risk tolerance.",

I've been able to put aside about 100k for investment purposes and am planning to add roughly 2k each month to this. The primary focus of my investment portfolio? ETFs.\r  \n\r  \nIn Switzerland, we get taxed on dividends as if it's income, which for me would be around a 20% tax. If I were to choose US ETFs, it seems there would be an additional 15% withholding tax. So, I'd be looking at a total of 35% tax on dividends.\r  \n\r  \nBut the silver lining here is that Switzerland doesn't tax capital gains. So, any gains from a growth ETF won't be taxed at all. Considering this, I'm thinking about mostly going for growth ETFs.\r  \n\r  \nDoes this sound to hold or am I missing something crucial here? Do you have recommendation for well-diversified growth ETFs?  \n\n\nThanks",

In the USA these are not really available as dividends has to be passed through however I do now some countries have a \"loophole\" that allows you to invest in accumulating funds\n\nThese funds basically do not pay out the dividends and just internally collect and re-invest them . Again I am not sure if that is an alternative in Switzerland",

Do I want to buy and sell a lot of just set it and forget it. If you want to buy and sell a lot, I wouldn't recommend a more upstart place like RH as they have had uptime issues for example.\n\n3. This isn't a question more of a statement. Since it's a retirement account I would just recommend a place that has a lot of staying power. Because of that I personally would not choose something like RH but chase could probably be fine?\n\nThat being said I chose vanguard but my 401k is in fidelity.

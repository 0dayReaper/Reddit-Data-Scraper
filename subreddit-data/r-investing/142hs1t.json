    "postText": "&gt;We are short Tingo Group Inc (NASDAQ:TIO) because we believe the company is an exceptionally obvious scam with completely fabricated financials. Tingo, headquartered in New Jersey, claims to have several business segments focused on providing mobile phones, food processing and an online food marketplace for farmers primarily located in Nigeria.\n\nTingo was created and run by \"Dozy\" Mmobuosi who is identified as a \"billionaire\" in the press and even tried to buy the soccer team Sheffield United. Dozy claims have made the first mobile payment app in Nigeria, but Hindenburg claims to have contacted the actual creator of said app who says that's a lie. Dozy further claims to have gotten a PhD in \"Rural advancement\" from a Malaysian University, but Hindenburg claims that said university has no one by that name in their register. Dozy was previously charged with 8 counts of writing hot checks in Nigeria in 2017 but letter settled the case in arbitration.\n\nIn 2019, Dozy claimed to have launched \u201cTingo Airlines\u201d and posted social media messages encouraging customers to \u201cfly with Tingo Airlines today\u201d. Media outlets later uncovered that Tingo had photoshopped its logo onto pictures of airplanes. Dozy later admitted to never owning any actual aircraft.\n\nIn April 2023, Tingo\u2019s Co-Chairman wrote a public letter resigning from the firm over many suspicious activities at the firm. Likewise, Tingo\u2019s food division is half a year old, yet yet allegedly does over half a billion dollars in business every three months with fatter profit margins than anyone else making food... Despite having no food processing plant and instead the more dubious claim to be the middleman between ordinary farmers and an unnamed food processor.\n\nTingo likewise showed photos of a groundbreaking ceremony building a food processing plant, but Hindenburg those were actually stock photos of an oil refinery. Rendering even more dubious Tingo's claim to be building many things at once, and Hindenburg said they found overgrown weeds at the alleged sites. Tingo likewise announced securing 150 million dollars in funding for more building from a bank who said their account balance with them was zero. Likewise, there's an affiliated entity transaction with Tingo Group buying Tingo Foods for the cost of their inventory, but said inventory drops from their balance sheet without explanation, making Hindenburg think it never existed to begin with and the transaction was just to boost valuations.\n\nAllegedly Tingo phone apps are servicing the same farmers that sell them food through two farming cooperatives, but Hindenburg said coops had never heard of Tingo and they had fewer than 100 farmers each. The owner of one co-op said flatly he had no relationship with Tingo who are surely just scammers.\n\nTingo claimed its mobile handset leasing, call and data segments generated $128 million in revenue last quarter (\\~15% of total), claiming these services are provided through an agreement with Airtel in Nigeria. The type of license they claim did not exist until June, 2023.\n\nOur checks with the Nigerian Communications Commission showed it has no record of Tingo being a mobile licensee at all, despite company claims of having 12 million mobile customers.\n\nDespite claiming to have millions of farmers using its phones, Tingo Mobile\u2019s corporate presentation and webpage uses stock photos of farmers using phones.\n\nHindenburg said the small office of Tingo's they found had notices on it saying the firm was tax delinquent. When Hindenburg tried to enroll in a phone plan they were told that location was not operational yet. Tingo allegedly also has a Ghana section, but there are no records of the firm's existence in Ghana and their email, website, and phone numbers are defunct in that country. Tingo also claimed partnership with a local Nigerian bank, who explicitly and publicly denies any affiliation. Likewise, Tingo's alleged point-of-sale software is simply photos of other people's software with their logo photoshopped onto it.\n\nHowever, truth becomes stranger than fiction when one realizes Tingo's sales projections exceeds the agricultural exports of Nigeria. And most of their website's links don't work and the testimonials are all fake. Hindenburg further claims they found no records of Tingo goods passing through Nigerian customs. In a classic among scammers, the financial reports have typos, math errors, and a note to itself that the accountant forgot to delete. The firm further claims to have been audited by an Israeli firm, which is strange since they do not claim to do any business in Israel.\n\nHindenburg believes Tingo Group is worth absolutely nothing. To be fair, this is both a fairly typical and a fairly sophisticated fraud for Nigeria, but the real question is how did this junk ever get listed on the NASDAQ? The answer is first they bought a company listed on an OTC market, and used that company to buy a tiny Chinese company already listed. ",

In an audit they don't give the audit company unrestricted access to their accounts and books, the auditors still basically go off of what they are provided by the client.",

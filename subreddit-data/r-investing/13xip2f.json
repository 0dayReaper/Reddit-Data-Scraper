    "postText": "I have an account with an European provider (e-Toro) known from trading CFDs. \n\nAll I have there is index funds and ETFs. All of them have no leverage (=X1). \n\nOver the months, I noticed my \"cash available\" has been decreasing, and there was no indication as to why and how. I got in touch. It turned out this is due to overnight/rollover fees. \n\nFine, but these only apply to CFDs. If I invest in no-leverage stuff, I was assuming it's not CFDs... I mean, basic stuff like NASDAQ-100 index fund. I'm not sure why I am being charged overnight fees.\n\nQuestion: Should I put up with this nonsense? Or is this common practice everywhere? What's your experience with that?\n\nThe fees are not a huge amount, but it feels like everything you get on that platform now automatically counts as CFD. And I find that misleading.\n\nJust don't come recommending some fancy American provider, please. I'm sure they're great, but they're not available in Europe. Thank you! :)",

This is one part of the fee (since if u buy and hold u spent those dollars for shares), second is the actual service of finding and maintaining the counter party and all the risks that comes with it. Therefore, the fee u pay is risk free + usually 1.5% atm around 7% yoy.\n\nmeaning, u have 100k, u buy cfd, u will earn 5k on that cash assuming u buy 1y treasures, u ll earn aprox. 8% on your cfd, so this 13k, then u ll pay 7k in fees, resulting in meager 6% roi -- cfd should be used for short term trades, u cannot afford 100 shares? (CSP) -- then u manage ur delta exposure with call debit spreads and pay a bit of theta.\n\nit sucks but as europoor u have go to learn if u wanna own American etf, or just buy sxr8 shares on xetra -- irish etf in eur that follows spy and reinvest divy.",

It didn\u2019t used to be like this! \n\nMy next question is does this stop us getting dividends as in theory we are not true stock holders and have merely entered into a contract for difference agreement. \n\nDebating pulling all funds out of etoro however it appears my smaller brokerage accounts now have a similar pattern with the CFD only despite being cash only",

I bought them in the firm conviction they were pure index funds/ETFs.\n\nYou can check if you're getting dividens on Settings &gt; Account &gt; Documents &gt; Account Statement.\n\nWhat annoys me is how they go on about \"no hidden fees\", and then this!\n\nGiven I'm making a profit with the current funds, I'm not pulling them for the time being. But I certainly won't buy anything else on Etoro. I'm really looking for another provider.",

CFDs are scammy and not meant for long term holding . If Etoro is doing this its probably to fool people into investing in their crappy CFD instead of actually buying the ETF shares",

Are you sure you are holding a UCITS? \n\nIt sounds like you are holding CFDs. \n\nAfaik - All if not most CFDs have overnight fees. It's kinda how CFDs are designed. Iirc - CFD counterparties are the CFD provider and not exchange traded.",

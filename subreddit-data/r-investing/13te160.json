Thank you\n\nEdit: this is not for a paper. I listened to Peter Schiff on the Jordan Peterson Poscast. He mentioned that subject but didn\u2019t explain in detail",

From a practical perspective it gives the US massive leverage in the global economy. It has facilitated government deficit spending because everyone in the world wants to buy US dollar-denominated bonds. It keeps our currency strong and our institutions involved in financial transactions in every corner of the globe. It also gives us a huge amount of control over financial transactions of third parties because we control the availability of dollars.\n\nIn short it's one of the key pillars of the success of the US economy and we would be reckless to squander it.\n\nEdit: no nation is likely to end it. Many would like to, chief among them China. But to use china as an example, their financial institutions are heavily controlled by the state. And as much as the US can and has abused its power for its own gain, china is known to be far worse and far less trustworthy. My point is, nobody, and i mean nobody, is even close to dethroning the dollar.",

Before you say that's what all currencies have, real currencies like USD have:\n\n1. A large, pre-existing market that requires it as a medium of exchange.\n2. Extremely safe investment vehicles to yield returns in the currency.\n3. A requirement to pay taxes in the currency.\n\nThese factors and more induce demand beyond simple personal preference. Add to this the high energy consumption, slow transaction rate, and deflationary nature of Bitcoin, and it's failure as a currency is clear as day. It's failure as any other kind of investment vehicle has been caused by it's transformation into a speculative casino for wall street types and retail gamblers to play in.\n\nAs for whether an alternative technological solution might emerge, i find it hard to conceive of. I think technology will replace cash, that our awful system of financial transactions (a Frankenstein monster combining new digital technology with ancient infrastructure) will be modernized. However i don't see so-called fiat currency going away.\n\nEven if the future world dominant currency isn't controlled by a single nation but is more of a supra-national currency (a la the Euro or this hypothetical BRICS currency) it will still be underpinned by government policy.",

I\u2019m not saying a current iteration of cryptocurrency is the answer but instant settlement with near zero overhead will for sure remake how banking is conducted today. Fiat was born of the need to make banking more efficient, it will be undone by tech covering that need. Why would anyone chose a trustless system over an trusted one? Once a hard money can be delivered instantly in an efficient manner it will be obviously the superior choice for risk managers.",

There is a constant demand for USD in FX markets. This means that US can print more then an avg country before currency gets devalued.\n\n3. Government spending would have to be gutted, interest rates would need to be kept higher in order not to devalue currency.\n\n4. Currently none is pretending to do so.",

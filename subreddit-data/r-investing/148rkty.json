    "postText": "During this current financial cycle, where would you all invest 100k USD ? Currently there seems to be high risk in most individual stocks. Large cap tech securities are trading with huge multiples that don't make sense. Has anyone utilized a high interest savings account for the moment ? Will bonds continue to rise? Is it smarter to just place money on the sidelines right now ? Real estate at this time is overinflated in my area and rates are out of control. There seems to be mixed information regarding a bear or bull market coming. With the latest CPI print inflation is barely starting to come down and there could be a possible rate hike pause. I have very little knowledge of the financial markets and I'm learning more every day. Just looking for everyone's  thoughts and opinions.",

I don't think so.\n\n\nWhile index funds have a role, there is some common sense left to investing and I suggest picking some that have reasonable valuations. There are opportunities in every market, and you can avoid higher risk sectors or companies if you prefer.\n\n\nYou aren't the only person thinking to put money aside waiting for the crash or tying it up with CD's that finally have yield. At some point, rates will drop and all that sidelined money will flow back into equity. When that will happen is impossible to predict, so if you have a longer term horizon, I would consider being bold at this point.",

Max out tax advantaged retirement accounts and suggest investing in a low-cost total market fund/ETFs (ala Bogle style)\n3. Consider prioritizing paying down debt if more than 5-7%+ interest \n4. Invest in yourself in terms of employment skills and degrees and large purchases like car and house and reasonable vacations/experiences. \n5. If any left over funds, then you can start investing as you hypothetically posed. This would be money you might potentially all lose. With your stated skill set, would suggest DCA into a low cost broad index fund or ETF \u2026. though much depends on goals and risk profile.",

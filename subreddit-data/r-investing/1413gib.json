But I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a good podcast that starts with no knowledge of the stock market and builds from there?\n\nIf not, what is the best podcast for a beginner? Not really interested in current events, but rather the principles of the stock market, investing, or economics/finance.",

Link here - [Reading List](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/readinglist)\n\nIf you know nothing about the capital markets - the Getting Started section at the SEC educational site can be a good place to start - [investor.gov](https://investor.gov) \\- there are also short 30 second videos on basics. The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is a US regulator with a focus to protect US investors through regulatory oversight of the securities markets.\n\nThe FINRA education site at [Finra Education](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest) also contains numerous free courses and educational materials. FINRA is a not-for-profit SRO (self regulatory organization) which is self-funded by it's members which are broker-dealers. It works under the supervision of the SEC with a mandate to protect the investing public against fraud and bad practice.",

His vibe is a little cheesy at times but it\u2019s a pretty approachable podcast for a beginner. \nThe show gets a little redundant and long-winded in later times, but the first 30-40 episodes are really, really great for learning basics of how to research and evaluate companies from a value investing perspective.",

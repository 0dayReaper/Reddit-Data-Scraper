Sell the ARKs and put it into QQQ (or XLK or IYW, and SOXX/SMH) and/or AAPL and the other top five giants... assuming you still want tech, but without extreme unnecessary added risk that the ARKs solicit.  \n\nAll those different V funds are underperforming VOO/VTI except for VUG which is underperforming QQQ.  Give yourself QQQ, APPL, VTI and some VXUS and you should be a lot happier than what you have now... but I'd also encourage you to check out the others I mentioned too.",

I am very new to investing.\n\nI have around 50k in the stock market (mainly VOO, VTI, QQQ) but it wasn't done with any intelligence. I mainly just dumped money every once in a while and didn't properly do dollar-cost-averaging.\n\nI make 115k/yr. I'm trying to reduce my expenses and funnel maybe 20% of my salary into the stock market per year so that I can retire early. My plan was to, at the same time every week, dump around 500 dollars into some portfolio, say 90% VOO, 10% QQQ. However, I'm not sure if I should just buy at the market value, or use limit orders of, say, -5% to try to get a better deal. What is the general guidelines for that? Should I buy some at market value, and then also put in a lower priced order in case the share price falls?\n\nAny other considerations or tips are very welcome. Thank you.",

So if you are adding regularly, then do just that, make it regular, essentially like 1pm every Friday or every paycheck.  Just get the money in promptly.  Of course if you have personal emergencies, you don't need to be completely rigid about it.  The point though is, if you have money you want to put in the market, then put it in the market.  (What you say about market orders is fine for VOO and QQQ since bid/ask will always be just a penny apart, but with anything else you should use limit orders to try to get the best deal you can that day, but still get it in.)",

There is no need to fear a recession with stocks rather than invest.  If unemployment goes up a half point or whatever, then sell.  Don't \"pre-recession\" your decisions.  You'll have very ample warning about a recession.

For stock companies, I just invest in SCHD and DGRO. I want to invest in REITs through index funds as well to keep my portfolio simple, but either the funds have low yield or invest in not so good REITs that offer high yields. To solve this, I decided to invest in just a few diversified REITs, so I don't have to track many different REITs and keep my portfolio simple. I decided to invest in O and WPC. \n\n  \nThe problem is the more I research into REITs, the more I overthink about what to invest in. For example, O and WPC are primarily retail companies, so maybe I should diversify more into different sectors like industrial, office, healthcare, mortgage, etc. But then, my portfolio won't be as simplified as I wanted it to be. Then, I might think about if it is even worth diversifying since retail REITs seem to perform well (e.g. majority of aristocrat REITs are retail). But then, I worry about something bad that could happen to the retail sector that would destroy my portfolio (like what's happening to the office sector right now). Or, I may think if I just invest in aristocrat REITs, no matter how much overlap they have, I will be fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really appreciate any inputs on my thoughts and what you all think about the subject.",

And I'd branch out a bit to include some BDCs and preferreds. For example, [ARCC outperforms both SPY and VTI throughout its entire existence](https://tinyurl.com/4sdetxfy). The company was robust through the Great Recession and steadily grew its dividend like a rocket; view the portfolio income graph toward the bottom.\n\nI understand wanting to keep things simple, but the same wisdom that led you this far will probably lead you toward some more decent choices. You can beat the market fairly easily going down this path, but stock picking does mean manual diversification is warranted.",

Let's say someone is contributing tax free while in either the 22% or 24% tax bracket, but pull themselves back into the 12% income tax prior to collecting contributions, can one do that?\n\nI suppose the only reason one wouldn't want to do this is if their yearly net income exceeds what they would lose in taxes when withdrawing contributions? Or, if someone didn't want to pull back in their last years of their career, in that case it might be smarter to contribute taxed income in a Roth solo 401k in the beginning of their career when they are in a lower tax bracket so if they are in a much higher bracket when its time to withdraw then no taxes then?",

In fact their earnings declined despite *increasing* margins from cost cutting. Not sustainable. Their hardware drivers of revenue all suffer from the same problem: longer upgrade cycles. The M1 chip was a huge upgrade for Mac but it sets people up to hold-off on upgrading again for many years. Customers knows each iPhone is an incremental upgrade and that Apple will provide software support for about 8 years which means they can upgrade at their leisure. They are victims of their own success here.\n\nWhat do people even think Apple's catalyst is? Their only growth category, services, is vulnerable to regulatory pressure. In 2024 EU will require Apple allow alternative app stores. This is going to make it clear that there are in fact valuable products (virtualization, game streaming, etc) that Apple is preventing from existing and therefore Apple\u2019s control of App Store harms consumer choice. Other markets may follow to force Apple to open their ecosystem.\n\nIt should be trading closer to $120 per share.",

You could also just do a targeted date index fund for when you plan to retire if you really wanna be hands off.\n\nI\u2019ve met a bunch of people that can\u2019t even grasp the concept of an ETF. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s for everyone and it\u2019s best to keep it simple. I\u2019ve never had an account with Edward Jones but I assume they may have higher fees on their mutual funds or maybe fees to even have an account with them. That\u2019s basically what you\u2019re aiming to avoid, Fidelity is great because they have mutual funds that have 0 fee\u2019s all together. Basically a loss leader in hopes you branch off into their other ecosystems. Their cash sweep is also very nice.",

Or whats the dangerous part about this speculation with options?\n\nId appreciate any insight into that! Thanks in advance",

You should target a flat amount saved every month to start out, say $20-40, and then spend as normal after pulling out that extra amount. \n\nStep two: now find something better than a bank for your money. Often this involves opening a brokerage account, (I hear good things about interactive brokers ) and then putting that money into either a bond (loan, but you play as the bank) or a group of stocks (what we call ETFs or exchange traded funds).\n\nOnce you figure out step one, step two will naturally happen because you will want your money to actually do something rather than sit there. \n\nWord of caution: for step 2, do a lot of learning from different resources, online, in person, and books. Don't trust anyone that says you will get a great return immediately, you should expect to make, from say $240 in savings for the year, an extra $10-20 from investments. \n\nFinally, over 20-30 years, that $240, when put into stable investments will typically become worth about $800-1200, so step two is important long term, but missing this first year by putting into a bank while you learn will not make or break you. \n\nGood luck!",

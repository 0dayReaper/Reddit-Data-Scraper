    "postText": "Hi r/investing\n\nI am selling a Short Term Rental (STR) property that i own as i am not bullish on this sector. Right now it cash flows about 25k per year, all of which goes to my wife for spending money. This return is taxed as income as a single member LLC.\n\nI want to replace the cash flow/spending money and am thinking of investing the cash into some other type of vehicle, perhaps a dividend growth fund and having the distributions deposited into her account to replace the spending money, rather than re-invested into the portfolio.\n\nI'm still actively trying to grown my net worth via asset growth strategies and am 15-20 years or so away from retirement.\n\nI think that I read that dividend investing is not a great strategy, and usually it is better to re-invest dividends and sell principle each month, although i am struggling to see why that would be since the dividends will be taxed at a lower rate than short term capital gains, plus there's a set a forget approach to putting the cash into dividend stock/ETF and having the money hit her account.\n\nWould this be a suitable approach to replace the rental income from the STR?\n\nWhat are the pros/cons of doing this?\n\nThanks!",

It's also a bit backwards in being cap-weighted, so it concentrates holdings in high-priced stocks like AMT that are really more growth than dividends. The consensus among those serious about dividend investing is that it's not the best approach.\n\nSelling shares isn't great in a recession, as it cannibalizes a portfolio. It sounds like OP wants this to continue for quite some time, so passive indexing as a sole strategy isn't the best.",

If you didn't have the confidence that the dividend fund would beat that metric, then I'd say why bother investing in that fund?\n\n\nBut if you're confident your profit will drop and your property will actually depreciate? Then sure I'd agree it doesn't make sense to keep it. I still think, playing the long game of financial security, real estate is hard to beat, though maybe in a market that isn't depreciating...\n\nThis sub is generally helpful but I'd be wary that a lot of the users shy away from real estate because they don't have experience owning property. No shade to them, a down-payment is a huge hurdle but I think you're probably financially in a different tier than a lot of users you're asking for advice from.",

As in, in much of the country it's too late for OP to cash out a windfall. If he was psychic and cashed out a year ago he'd be sitting pretty, but that's not true today. \n\n\nRates are already up, prices are down 10% and have kind of stabilized, inventory is way down as no one wants to sell away their 3% mortgage. \n\n\nIt's impossible to say without knowing where OP is, but in a general sense I don't think depreciating home values over the next decade are a done deal. But who knows.  Unless his house depreciates by 25k/yr, it's not like he has interest payments to fight against. I wouldn't sell but I don't know where he is",

When you receive a bond coupon payment, you retain 100% of your capital ***plus*** you earn the interest. When you receive a dividend, your capital drops by the amount of the dividend because that dividend was already priced in. So when you receive a dividend, you're not any further ahead. Your account balance remains the same. So when you withdraw that dividend, your account balance is now less than it was before you received the dividend. This is in contrast to a bond portfolio where if you withdraw your coupon payment, your account balance would be the same as it was before the coupon was paid.",

It sounds like you're suggesting a stock that pays a dividend is guaranteed to outperform in down markets.\n\nNo, that's your own statement that you're adding. I've been perfectly clear: passive indexing is guaranteed to underperform badly in down markets, and that's a difference from dividend investing. **Way to dodge the unquestionable truth that selling shares at a loss is destructive to a portfolio, directly responsible for poor performance of passive indexing in down markets.**\n\nI'll extend it for you, though. It's quite easy to create a dividend portfolio that outperforms in down markets. That, coupled with the guaranteed underperformance of passive indexing, means that passive indexing is a poor choice for an all-weather portfolio and dividend investing is not.\n\n&gt; when you receive a dividend, you're not any further ahead\n\nMy goodness. Good luck with your boglehead-in-the-sand approach, where you use bad math to justify obvious falsehoods. Dividends are passed-through earnings. You're ahead by the amount of the payments. An example: an REIT receives rents, takes expenses off the top, and sends 90% of the remainder through to shareholders. It no more \"decreases the capital\" of the REIT than a landlord accepting rent \"decreases the capital\" of the property. You can conceptually liken this to the landlord (REIT) signing over a portion of each check to shareholders. Each REIT shareholder owns as many shares as previously, there's been no dilution of shares, there's been no change to the underlying holdings (which happen to be cash-generating); only a moron would see this as a *loss*, and that'd have to include all of the world's landlords, too stupid to realize the rent-based income they receive is a \"loss\" when they're cash-flow positive.\n\nNot only that, but a persistent implied fallacy in your line of thinking is assuming that reinvesting earnings, that would otherwise be paid as dividends, is perfectly efficient. It often is not (see wasteful companies like Uber) whereas, absent potential tax drag, passed-through earnings (a.k.a. dividends) are **100% efficient** in supplying portfolio performance, either income or growth. In passive indexing, you *may* see a return down the road if you're lucky and haven't had to sell shares; with dividends you're guaranteed an actual profit now, assuming the company is simply stable.\n\nDividend traps aside, dividends simply aren't portfolio-destructive. Selling shares at a loss is. Twist as you like, hate it as you like, find it inconvenient as you like, avoid discussing it truthfully as you like.",

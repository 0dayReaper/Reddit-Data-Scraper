However, I recently learned my qualified dividend tax rate is 0%, so dividends suddenly become a lower risk and potentially higher return option for me. Is 50% SCHD 50% QQQM an intelligent long term portfolio in this scenario? Or is pure dividend ETFs a better idea?",

If the stock market falls by 40%, then dividend yield will go up by 1/(1-0.4) but total  payout will be the same.  The relative stability of dividends one is my leap of faith.\n\n3. So if I want a 4% rate of withdrawal *without touching the principal*, I can just buy SCHD, live on the dividends and forget about it.   This way, market gyrations won't affect my actual spending.   \n\nIf I just obeyed the traditional 4% spend-down rule with growth stocks, I'd be cashing out 4% at market highs (selling at market highs is good, I guess, but my income would be more than I need) but also at lows (it's not good to sell at a low, but my income would also be lower at these times, which I don't want).    \n\nOr I guess I could adjust cash-out according to the P/E ratio, which would loosely mimic the dividend fund by effectively treating growth as a dividend, and approximating this growth as 1/(P/E).\n\nAll of these rules are designed to guarantee perpetual income: either leaving an inheritance, or living forever.\n\n&gt; SCHD has nearly identical risk-adjusted return since inception versus the US total market (0.85 for SCHD, 0.84 for VTI), and vs a large cap index that (0.85 for SCHD, 0.86 for VV).\n\nI suggest any differences could be random, so the taking dividends just simplifies things. One issue is that dividend growth typically outpaces inflation, so one would be back-loading retirement, living like a king at 90.",

Say a person retires with a $1M portfolio on year 0. They would take 4% as income - $40K. Say inflation goes up by 3% in that year, and their market returns are -10%. They would take $41,200 as income, even though their portfolio has declined. Further, this \"rule\" is really more of an observation that a US-dominant large cap portfolio (ie SP500) with a mixture of US equities and bonds has been able to have 4% stable withdrawal for 30 years - nothing more than that. Anyone who invests in other assets (ie, international funds), or for different durations (say, living indefinitely), gets no information from the rule because the conditions don't apply. I think there's a better argument that [2.26% is closer to a safe withdrawal rate](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4227132).\n\nb) dividends don't go down - [this is false](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-dividend/table/by-year). Dividends are indeed less volatile than the market, but they are not a perpetually increasing, or even keeping up with inflation, source of income.\n\nNow, living off the dividends from SCHD, or really any other fund, is not, generally a bad idea. You will be starting out with less than 4% withdrawal (SCHD doesn't have 4% yield, it has \\~3.6% yield), which helps a lot with sequence of withdrawals risk. You will also be taking less income in the case of a market drawdown - again, helps with long term stability. However, this isn't because of the dividend, it's because you're taking less income. You can replicate that effect with many strategies by... spending less money. I'll also note that most folks tend to spend the most money at beginning of retirement and end of retirement. So yes, you'll most likely do well close to end of life, but your start of retirement may disappoint you.\n\nI'm not going to discourage you from your strategy - it is a nice conservative approach that is decently likely to succeed. However, you haven't discovered a magic cheat code for retirement - you're proposing saving up more money than others do (because dividend yields are usually &lt;4%), and spending less money than other people do (because you'll adjust your income up and down based on dividend yield, when they keep constant income).",

And that's a much worse retirement than I had been imagining. \n\nHowever, this leads to a paradox: If I retire  with $1M at 70, taking out $40K a year, and the market goes up by 7% with inflation at 2%, the rule says I should up my retirement spending by a factor of 1.02.  However, I could get a job for a day, and re-retire with the new amount, and take out 1.07x more (but I'd have to be willing to re-retire at a lower rate if the market goes down, otherwise this would be a statistical cheat).   So that it seems that the initial 4% plus inflation rule *should* be functionally the same as 4% in any given year, by treating any year as a new starting year. \n\n&gt;  Further, this \"rule\" is really more of an observation that a US-dominant large cap portfolio (ie SP500) with a mixture of US equities and bonds has been able to have 4% stable withdrawal for 30 years\n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt; I think there's a better argument that 2.26% is closer to a safe withdrawal rate.\n\nThe fact that dividends for SCHD are 3.6% (and 4% by scaling the March bump-up from last year to the next 3 quarters) suggests otherwise to me.\n\n&gt; b) dividends don't go down - this is false\n\nI think that your source is a good piece of evidence that *for practical purposes* that dividends are quite stable, and rising with inflation.    Even the Great Crash caused just a 25% dip, and VYM dividend fund had a smaller 21% dip (SCHD doesn't go back to 2007).\n\n&gt; you haven't discovered a magic cheat code for retirement - you're proposing saving up more money than others do (because dividend yields are usually &lt;4%)\n\nYes, it's not a magic cheat code.  It's a volatility-reduction code.  The thing that prevents people from taking out more than X% is the long-tail volatility risk, and it's smaller for dividends than stock prices.     Maybe a covered call strategy would be another way of achieving this.  You probably can't change the expected returns, but maybe you can trade a small amount of gains for a lot of volatility reduction.\n\nIf I had time, I'd like to back-simulate dividend only strategies (but the creation of share buy-backs would throw a monkey wrench into it as dividends were re-directed after a certain point).\n\nI'm honestly baffled by the 2.26% rate, however.   I can beat this with current 4% (or 3.6% if you prefer) dividends, and even if they took a 25% 2009-style dip, I'd still be better off.    And I'd never touch my principal.",

Your approach of \u201cre-retiring\u201d every year doesn\u2019t invalidate that. The rule/observation is not a retirement plan. It is, in some ways, an \u201cabsolute worst case\u201d outcome - with the slight caveat that \u201cabsolute worst case\u201d usually means 95th percentile outcome.\n\nI\u2019d ask you to consider what \u201cfor practical purposes\u201d means to you - and I\u2019m not trying to lead you or disagree with your outcome. Dividends from, SP500 went down 32% in 1931, recovered, then and in 1937 went down 34% again. Those are the sorts of outcomes the Trinity study (4% rule) and my linked papers are referring to. Around the world markets do strange things - country markets collapse, and countries go to war, which tends to drastically reduce dividend distributions (ie, in WW2, see flat dividends that were at great depression levels). You may not plan for that, and that\u2019s perfectly fine. That is, however, where the 2.26% outcome comes from - \u201ceven if they took a 25% 2009-style dip\u201d is by far not the worst outcome possible in a developed market, historically. It\u2019s not even the worst case in the USA.\n\nWhat we\u2019re both identifying is that variable withdrawal strategies are a great way of increasing expected retirement income - at the cost of that income varying over time, and potentially dropping drastically. Some folks can manage to do that, especially if they don\u2019t have a mortgage. Some folks can\u2019t, and they need to look more towards fixed withdrawal strategies. If the way to do variable withdrawal for you is dividends, great.\n\n\u2026 but it\u2019s still not the dividend that\u2019s doing it, it\u2019s because you\u2019re reducing your withdrawal when the market is down :)",

But also reducing my *percentage* withdrawal if the market becomes inflated, because yield goes down.\n\nI've seen the FI Calc tool, but i didn't realize it was so versatile.\n\nIncidentally, [another successful strategy seems to be to pull out  (1%+0.5/CAPE)](https://ficalc.app?additionalIncome=%5B%5D&amp;additionalWithdrawals=%5B%5D&amp;bondsFees=0.05&amp;bondsFinalRatio=15&amp;bondsInitialRatio=0&amp;capeWeight=0.5&amp;capeWithdrawalRate=1&amp;cashFees=0&amp;cashFinalRatio=5&amp;cashGrowth=1.5&amp;cashInitialRatio=0&amp;changeAllocationsOverTime=false&amp;equitiesFees=0.04&amp;equitiesFinalRatio=80&amp;equitiesInitialRatio=100&amp;initialPortfolioValue=1000000&amp;maxWithdrawalLimit=60000&amp;maxWithdrawalLimitEnabled=false&amp;minWithdrawalLimit=20000&amp;minWithdrawalLimitEnabled=true&amp;numberOfYears=30&amp;portfolioRebalanceEquation=linear&amp;rebalance=true&amp;rebalanceFrequency=1&amp;retirementStartingAge=60&amp;withdrawalStrategyName=capeBased)\n\nThis is 100% successful historically, with zero near-fails, and 90% of withdrawals being over ($30K), and the median payout being 5.4%.   This is basically similar to dividends, but taking 0.5/CAPE as a measure of the implied dividend, assuming 50% payout, and adding on a minimum 1%.  The bulge of the final distribution is relatively fat (platykurtic?) so it seems to take from the extremes to feed the center. \n\nThe [Endowment Strategy](https://ficalc.app?additionalIncome=%5B%5D&amp;additionalWithdrawals=%5B%5D&amp;bondsFees=0.05&amp;bondsFinalRatio=15&amp;bondsInitialRatio=0&amp;cashFees=0&amp;cashFinalRatio=5&amp;cashGrowth=1.5&amp;cashInitialRatio=0&amp;changeAllocationsOverTime=false&amp;endowmentCurrentPortfolioRatio=30&amp;endowmentPercentOfPortfolio=5&amp;endowmentPreviousWithdrawalRatio=70&amp;equitiesFees=0.04&amp;equitiesFinalRatio=80&amp;equitiesInitialRatio=100&amp;initialPortfolioValue=1000000&amp;maxWithdrawalLimit=60000&amp;maxWithdrawalLimitEnabled=false&amp;minWithdrawalLimit=20000&amp;minWithdrawalLimitEnabled=true&amp;numberOfYears=30&amp;portfolioRebalanceEquation=linear&amp;rebalance=true&amp;rebalanceFrequency=1&amp;retirementStartingAge=60&amp;withdrawalStrategyName=endowmentStrategy) does even better, though, and it is super-simple, sort of a filtered 5% withdrawal reacting slowly to market changes.\n\nIn the end, I think the lesson is that all adjustable strategies reduce the risk of failure (to zero, if a simple percentage strategy), which I think is what you said.",

Say we have a $1M portfolio. Take the 4%, inflation-adjusted, 30 year retirement approach ($40K income, inflation-adjusted, period). Historically, that has resulted in about 4-5% failure. If you increase that to 5% ($50K income, period, inflation-adjusted, using [FI Calc](https://ficalc.app/), a great tool), that skyrockets to 25% failure.\n\nNow, look at the \"95% rule\" - this is withdraw x% of the current portfolio value, or 95% of previous year's withdrawal, whichever is higher. Such a person can only have their income go down by 5% each year, at most. With that, you can do:\n\na) 6% withdrawals, with 0% failure - ends up with average $60K income, but 10% of the time, someone will end up with a withdrawal of $23K\n\nb) 7% withdrawals, with 10% failure - ends up with average $61K income, but 10% of the time, someone will end up with a withdrawal of $21K\n\nc) 8% withdrawals, with 15% failure rate - ends up with average $62K income, but 10% of the time, someone will end up with a withdrawal of $18K.\n\nHaving only 5% reduction income per year has a massive effect on the amount you can withdraw every year.",

If you start to earn enough qualified dividends (or other income) to kick you out of the 0% cap gains bracket, you lose that property.\n\nCapital gains are taxed identically as qualified dividends, but only on the gain. If you have a stock you bought at $50 and sold at $100, you would not incur $100 in capital gains. Capital gain taxation will always be lower than qualified dividend taxation because only a portion of your income is taxed with capital gains, and the entirety of your dividend is taxed.",

I could be wrong, but SCHD and similar funds are the exception because they stay competitive in terms of value with the conventional S&amp;P 500. While the dividends can be good, unless you have a large amount of capital AND it appreciates, it won't add up to much.\n\n**Ex. 5000 shares of SCHD** (\\~$355,000) with a 0.65 income from distribution 4 times a year (and that's an ambitious rate) still comes to $13,000 (3.6% return) PLUS whatever the ETF gains or loses. If the yearly returns stay competitive with the S&amp;P 500, it seems a solid investment. That 13,000 reinvested buys you another 183 shares of SCHD, but again it depends on the yearly return's consistency.\n\nHowever, if SCHD falters compared to the S&amp;P 500 and the distribution rate doesn't continue to grow, then it seems to not work.

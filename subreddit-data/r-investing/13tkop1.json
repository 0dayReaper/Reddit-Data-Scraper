    "postText": "So I was looking through Canadian stocks with around 10mil market cap and I came across these guys as my first shot at fundamentals analysis. \n\nOn their statement of owner equity I believe they have something called \"deficit\". That doesn't make any sense to me. Could anyone explain it?\n\nFurther, it looks like they're just looting the company, though they acknowledge that dilution is their business model so maybe that's not as horrible as it sounds. I feel like the average investor here just keeps getting killed. To be honest, I don't know why the execs would exercise their options except to immediately sell shares.\n\nIs this company as bad as it looks? Is it typical of a small prospecting company? I find it funny that they give employees and consultants options that they expire and they reprice everything for the execs/board. Is there a company out there that doesn't reprice their option strikes for top level guys when the stock falls?",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, just looking for some guidance.\n\nI currently max out my Roth IRA through fidelity every year. And I contribute to a traditional 457b - with no match, I am in a union with a pension plan. I am not maxing my 457b, but contributing while also being eligible for a pension.\n\nMy 457b is traditional, but there is a Roth 457b as well. Since I am already maxing my Roth IRA, am I able to contribute to my Roth 457b? So 6500 into Roth IRA and 6500 into Roth 457B? Or is that considered double dipping into Roth investments?\n\nThanks!",

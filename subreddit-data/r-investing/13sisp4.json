    "postText": "I am debating how I want to allocate my stock portfolio. I am currently in my mid twenties. I want to focus mostly on growth due to my age but was thinking of adding a bit of dividend income (SCHD seems like a good choice). However, I am getting mixed feedback on dividend income and the tax drag.\n\nCurrently my stock portfolio is split maybe 90% VOO and 10% QQQ. My Roth IRA is 100% in VFIAX. I had two new potential portfolio allocations in mind, but I am also only a year or two into my investing journey so I thought I\u2019d ask for opinions.\n\n1.\n\nVFIAX - 50%\n\nVSMAX - 10%\n\nVIMAX - 10%\n\nQQQ - 15%\n\nSCHD - 15%\n\n2.\n\nVFIAX - 70%\n\nQQQ -15%\n\nSCHD - 15%\n\nOr recommendations on an alternative?",

            "comment": "Someone your age should be avoiding the concept behind SCHD.  Why do you want to pay more taxes?\n\nYour bottom line should just be total return (coupled with the consideration of how much risk you want to take).  If some dividend stock's total return is massive and you have to pay some taxes on its dividends, you shouldn't care, the net bottom line is all that matters.  But just getting dividends without a corresponding positive return would make a dividend a negative.\n\nInvest in quality ETFs and companies that you judge will get you the best return and be within your risk parameters.  Don't focus on the trivia of cost or dividends or not.  That's all resolved in the total return.",

Can I ask why you're not a fan of QQQ?",

No real answers yet and thousands spent trying to figure it out but I figured growth is amazing, but a dividend income would be a peace of mind safety net I could reinvest unless I need it. Maybe that's super flawed thinking so I wanted opinions.",

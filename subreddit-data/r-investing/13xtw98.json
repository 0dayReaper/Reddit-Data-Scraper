    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI have been interested in emerging EV manufacturers. Of course we all know how incredible successful Tesla stock is... but they do not have a monopoly on the EV market far from it. You can argue they have a monopoly on the charging infrastructure but that will change in time.\n\nPolestar atleast in the UK where I am from is one of the more popular choices, they have sold over 10k cars in the UK. But if you look at the PSNY stock it keeps falling and falling its now almost $3. I know the China ownership is a big red flag (pardon the pun) but why is the stock worth so little? To me it seems under valued, based on their product. I think its one of the best EVs on the market, but you wouldnt think so if you look at the graph.",

            "comment": "Looking for rationality in the valuation of speculative new tech stocks is a losing game. \n\nThe more speculative it is, the more likely it\u2019s some version of a pump and dump investment vehicle built on top of a business, and I often wonder if the business or just the investment vehicle was the primary intent. \n\nAt peak, PSNY\u2019s market cap was almost as high as GM\u2019s, so the crash is some sort of moderate return to reality, but still arguably high at over $6B. \n\nPolestar is interesting, but auto manufacturing requires massive networks of suppliers, sales/service locations and manufacturing infrastructure. With every major manufacturer going all in on EVs, I don\u2019t see it likely that either them or Tesla will be able to compete.",

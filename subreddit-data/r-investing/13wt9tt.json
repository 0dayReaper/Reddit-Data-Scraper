    "postText": "I want to buy a 3mo CD using Fidelity.  Is there any reason not to just grab the one at the top of the list sorted by yield or is there any difference in a say a smaller bank I\u2019m unfamiliar with that is at 5.3% vs say Capital One at 5.2%?\n\nBoth say call protected.  Not sure what I should be looking for, first time buying CD\u2019s.\n\nThanks",

So just grab the highest APY.\n\nHighest coupon may NOT be best return if it's under re-sale over par.  so APY will tell you.\n\nAgain, 3mos you really don't have to worry about Monthly interest vs. Quarterly vs. 'At Maturity' (something you'll want to consider for much longer duration).\n\nAssuming it's under FDIC limit  (for total invested with that one bank).  If over limit: move to another bank for the rest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nonce you get to longer duration (over 18mos) - you'll want to start to look at \"Call\" provisions and coupon schedule (depending on  your needs).",

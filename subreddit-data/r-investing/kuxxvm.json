It just goes to show that there is still very little liquidity actually moving the price around. I personally think it will probably bounce back up within a month or two, and the roller coaster will continue again.",

If it dropped by 70%, the PE ratio would still be absolutely insanely high.\n\nTSLA currently has a higher valuation than every other car manufacturer...

Whether the story is true or not does really matter, but the pattern seems to repeat itself. A buddy of mine told me his father, who is no more investment-wise than a 5-year-old, was telling everyone Bitcoin was going to be a great investment - this was on Saturday morning. Perfect timing.",

This is a currency, not a company, so much of its value ends up being driven by its demand for its own sake, which ultimately gets driven by what you can use it for (which right now mainly is being able to trade it for other currencies).\n\nI don't pretend to know which way it is going.",

Meaning, people would keep their extra cash in the form of Bitcoin. The reason they do this over Gold is because,\n\n1. If you're buying actual gold, it's expensive to move, to secure, and to sell. You can use your hold to buy coffee at Starbucks. But you can sell your gold for cash and then use that at Starbucks. This is what I see bitcoin doing. Sell what you need in the currency you're using and then buy what you want. If we go to a digital money where wallets can swap from BTC to USDC or whatever currency you're using, then that would make it even easier to use. Zap is already doing something like this. \n\n2. You're buying paper gold in which you don't actually own the gold and effectively lose the argument of \"owning gold\". \n\nAlso, gold isn't a known finite supply. We're always finding new ways to mine, new deposits on earth, and when we decide, we could mine on astroids too. I think if it was profitable, Elon Musk might play a part in something like that.

There are plenty of metals that are useful for many things but don't hold the value of the gold. I've read this could be because gold doesn't rust so it stores easier though, but idk. Since I was born, 90's everything has been going digital. From music, banking, payments, communication etc... It makes sense that store of value would move digitally as well. \n\nAlso, I think gold is still a speculative asset. Why are people holding it in ETCs? Not so they can one day withdraw it and use it as semi-conductors or another use case. It's because they think that it will hold it's value vs the USD. It's \"rare\" and someone else will pay more for it when fiat crashes. With impending inflation in the US, all assets may rise but Bitcoin will surely outperform. Huge banks such as JP Morgan and Citi Bank are accumulating and a lot of other big money companies are speculating that bitcoin will go up. \n\nIdk about you but I wouldn't bet against big money. Although, if Bitcoin did bust, I'm sure the companies would get a bail out. It's still risky for retail investors but I think the risk will be worth the reward.",

Heck, even today its a viable option. Although admittedly its very early and needs the kinks worked out.\n\nAnd again I'll emphasize \"very early\" and \"needs the kinks worked out\"... for those who surely are itching to respond with \"so what, fees are too high\".",

Back in the early days people used to send others crypto just for a witty reddit comment and it really normalized sending and gave people the confidence when they send money it will actually show up",

As in:\n\n* Purchasing is still a little rough, but it is getting easier and safer everyday. I'm not really nervous anymore, but in terms of buying an actual BTC / ETH and sending it your wallet still needs some streamlining. \n* Sending / using your crypto used to be so much more common, now a lot of people just buy to hold. \n\nDeFi has changed this to an extent as it looks like more people are willing to use their capital. However high fees on BTC and ETH seem to have simply made it cost prohibitive to go all out on the 'for fun' transactions - tipping comments, trying out a dapp, throwing .01 BTC at Satoshi Dice back in the day. \n\nWhat you said is true about normalizing it. I remember my first sends I was so nervous but after seeing how it worked it was like an 'ah-ha' moment. I think my friends would be more excited about the tech if I could sit down with 1 ETH and show them all the cool things I can do. Which simply isn't possible (cheaply anyway) with the current fees. Short term problems - scaling solutions are coming.",

The value of the currency isn't just in the currency itself but in all the things you could arbitrage against it.  If somebody refused to buy your dollar bill for more than 50% of what it was worth the day before then you'd just use it to buy some normal good/service at the price it is normally worth.  Currency markets are a thing but they can't fluctuate that fast because the money can actually be used for real-world things which basically act like a reserve of sorts.\n\nThe Fed intervenes on a longer time scale.  They're trying to prevent prices from changing dramatically over a period of months or years.  They don't go changing the money supply every morning to keep it from jumping 20% that day.\n\nThat said, I do think the lack of any kind of reasonable control on supply is a weakness of many cryptocurrency designs.  Most central banks ask questions like \"what is the price of milk/bread?\"  A cryptocurrency has no way to tie its value to thinks like this unless it is at the hands of some kind of regulating authority, and then you get the question of who do you trust to wield that power?",

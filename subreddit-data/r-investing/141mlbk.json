    "postText": "I\u2019m 33 years old, I\u2019ve just started my 401k, so I don\u2019t have much money in there. My employer matches 100% of the first 4% deducted from my biweekly paycheck. They also offer a Roth IRA, which I haven\u2019t started making contributions to since they don\u2019t match that. \n\nI\u2019ve been only contributing 4% of my salary into it. I can afford to put more but I\u2019m not sure how much more since I\u2019ve been told I started at a late age. \n\nAlso there are so many different allocations in my 401k plan, any recommendations on which funds to choose? I\u2019ve been told to choose less risk funds because I started late and can\u2019t afford losses if anything happens.",

Contribute at least 10%, probably closer to 15% or more because you\u2019re behind. \n\nIf they have target date funds, that\u2019s a good one to start with if you don\u2019t know much about investments. They\u2019re globally diversified and do all the allocating and rebalancing for you. \n\nYou don\u2019t want low risk, you\u2019re 33 so have 30+ years still until retirement. Also because you started late you especially can\u2019t afford low growth, because you\u2019ve got catching up to do with 10 years lost.",

            "comment": "I would pick a broad index fund with the lowest expense ratio on offer. For example, my employer uses ADP, so I can choose between 20 or so different funds. I went with Fidelity 500 Index Fund(FXAIX). This has a 0.015% expense ratio. That's $7.5 per year on a $50k 401k.\n\nThe American Funds Target Date Fund that ADP defaults users to has a 0.38% expense ratio (RFKTX). That's a $190 per year on a $50k 401k. Waste of money IMO and I'm sure ADP gets a kickback for defaulting to such a high cost fund.\n\nGrowth funds are appropriate for your age (25-30 years from retirement).",

Then contribute to a Roth IRA whatever else you can invest probably VTI 65 % VXUS 35% ish if you still can invest more after maxing out your Roth IRA go back to putting more into the 401k",

            "comment": "At 33 you want to take on  risk. In investing you are getting paid to hold other people's risk.  Over the course of 30 years taking on too little risk turns the possibility of loss into the certainty of loss because you compound so much more slowly.  You are nowhere near 30 years short of death.  You derisk right before retirement to avoid sequencing risk, your sequencing risk right now is 0.  \n\nAlways contribute up to the employer match.  So you are doing the right thing there.  If your salary is still low Roth is better than traditional 401k so contribute the most you can after the 4% to the Roth.  If your salary is high, the opposite applies and the 401k is better.  If you are in the middle I'd try and split equally to control tax risk. \n\nIn terms of asset allocation, they likely have a predefined retirement options.  Pick one appropriate for someone 10 years younger than yourself.  Which for you means look for something  like a 2065 fund.

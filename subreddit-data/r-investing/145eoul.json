    "postText": "In this post I will talk about an issue that has been in the air for quite a long time; the role of Japan in global sovereign liquidity and the risk of a shift in their monetary policy. \n\n  \nAfter the bursting of its colossal financial bubbles in the 80s, Japan embraced three decades of significant QE that has been indirectly injecting liquidity into the rest of the world.  That's because since the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BOJ) aggressive policies distorted local assets to the point of causing negative rates and no incentive to invest in bonds both domestic retail and institutional investors massively invested abroad. At the same time, differences in interest rates between Japan and the rest of the world fueled the so called carry trades, essentially borrowing money in Japan at very low interest rates then convert this money into another currency and invest it in high quality sovereign bonds at nice rates. At the end of the day you have a leveraged position in a high quality investment.  Of course this trade has a currency risk (if yen appreciates then you are screwed) but the BOJ has been consistently buying and selling foreign currencies in order to maintain the Yen quite stable. \n\n  \nWe all know interest rates are cool until central banks see serious side effects like high and persistent inflation, well the thing is Japan is suffering its highest inflation rate in 30 years and core consumer prices is twice as much as the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) target level (approx 4% vs 2% target) and with increasing prices in raw materials and some goods Japan needs to import its difficult to think inflation will cool down by itself. \n\nDespite Japan has a low interest rate compared with the rest of developed economies they face a high risk because of this inflation. The yen is currently in a depreciation spiral, which is a consequence of the BOJ\u2019s aggressive actions to halt yields from rising because the most indebted developed state in the world cant afford higher interest rates. In other words, they can protect the yen or interest rates but not both, as the yen depreciates, inflation increases and the Japanese central bank must do even more QE to keep interest rates in check. They cant allow inflation to get out of control like in the US, because the system is so fragile it wont resist.  \n\nA slight change in Japan's economic policy in the next years is expected by many analysts. \n\n  \n**SUMMARY**\n\nJapan\u2019s policies of the last 30 years fueled a massive demand for global assets (mostly sovereign bonds). Japan may be forced to shift monetary policy in the near future because of inflation (among many other economic problems that exceed this post), if this happens the demand of said sovereign bonds will plummet causing a massive liquidity problems. This affects your investments because lower demand for sovereign debt hurts the ability of governments to stimulate the economy like they did in the last decades. ",

They cant do something like the FED is doing because their economy is too much into debt and its way less dynamic (among many other things) so they cant afford this to go out of control. \n\nIts quite possible they start to slowly change their monetary policy in order to control inflation (the right thing to do), but if they do they will also drain liquidity from the global bonds market and this will affect the ability other governments have to stimulate the economy.",

If it had spread and become more severe it would have helped counter or completely countered the inflationary pressures.  \n\nAs far as a shrinking workforce and inflation, that's a supply constraint.  In and of itself it would cause labor prices to increase relative to other prices.  So for example rents::wages in Japan have declined a lot in the last 33 years. Japan went from the most expensive real estate market in the world, by a lot, to a place where Australians buy a cheap 2nd home.  In and of themselves supply constraints can be inflationary or deflationary.",

Numbers across Europe is coming in lower than expected. Why should this year be different from any of the previous years this topic has been discussed? Inflation in Japan is no where near as bad as other places and other places are already cooling together with Japan.",

Sustained inflation is bad, he is not happy about this I can tell you. \n\nIn fact he also said the Bank of Japan would \u201crespond quickly\u201d if there were any signs of a structural change in price pressures across the economy,  \u201cThere is a risk that we will be late in raising interest rates if we get our future outlook wrong, and there is also the risk of prematurely doing a rate hike.\u201d   \nJapanese central bankers are dovish as hell, they dont talk about rate hikes unless they are preparing the markets for something.\n\nIn addition I currently see both American and European central bankers (but mostly Europeans) freaking out over this.  They have meetings with Japanese officials over this all the time. \n\nIt wont be crazy for BOJ to rise rates by july or something and it may ignite a sovereign debt crisis because of markets discounting less sovereign debt demand in the future.",

Months to months data is inherently noisy and last time Ueda gave his major press release he emphasized that current inflation isn\u2019t a sustained inflation he wants and that he will continue easing for a while. I think it\u2019s backwards. He WANTS sustained inflation. It has been BOJ\u2019s goal for over a decade.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/knT8tyA4tf8?feature=share\n\nHe is dovish compared to Kuroda but nothing like Fed or ECB. Also he\u2019s quite pragmatic in his views and one of his stated goals remain providing clarity to the market. Why would he try to surprise everyone like Kuroda if it would as you argue lead to sovereign debt crisis?",

Japanese people and institutions dumping foreign debt shouldn't be a problem for Japan. \n\n&gt;People there have accepted their poverty. Nobody is getting married. Nobody is having kids. \n\nfuck, this is so depressing! Japan was such a promising economy before they started following stupid policies  \n\n&gt;They do not consume much.

I'll pick at two of those statements.   \n\nJapan's birth rate is higher than multiple countries in the region and is on par with native populations of Western countries. Here's a [Wikipedia page about fertility rates by country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependencies_by_total_fertility_rate).   \n\nTheir marriage rate is middle-of-the-road, higher than multiple Western countries, but nowhere near the bottom. For fun you can look at [this Wikipedia page on marriage and divorce stats by country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_demography). For example if you wanted to compare against the US: Japan's marriage rate per 1000 people is 4.8 versus the US' 5.1, but Japan's divorce rate is 1.7 versus the US' 2.3. Really not an earthshattering difference and if anything, Japan's marriage stats look slightly better as proportionally fewer end in divorce while not proportionally having that fewer marriages.\n\nI don't know why such misinformation about specifically Japan is so prevalent on reddit, it's like people *want* these stats to be worse than they are, but you don't have to actively contribute to it.",

First off it would force companies to start generating profits to compete with government bonds.  It would Japan's savers so yield.  Japanese companies could be more profitable were they inclined to use assets aggressively.  They need a Japanese Michael Milken to free the system up. \n\nAs the central bank loses money on its bonds permanently from negative real yields that money flows into the Japanese system. Yes it might be inflationary but inflation helps to clear debt and make safe assets less appealing. Change is not all bad.  As for fragility I don't see much fragility.",

I just bring that up to say that the economic rules that generally persist in the US may not in Japan and they are very difficult to predict even in the US.  Japanese do not over consume and they can adjust their demand to almost nothing, so the rules relating to inflation and interest rates are very different (my guess) than those that relate to the US.  Everything I am stating is anecdotal, but my point is don't  try to predict what will happen with Japan.",

            "comment": "I don't think that you would be able to find a US domiciled ETF that accumulates. ETFS are generally '40 Act registered investment funds. By law, the fund must distribute net capital gains and accrued income to its shareholders at least once per year.\n\nIf you have a thesis that 2 year interest yields will go down, you could explore using interest rate futures products like /ztm instead. More info on the CME site here - [https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates.html)\n\nIf you are outside the US - there are accumulating treasury UCITS funds from investment managers like Blackrock, Invesco, and Vanguard with both accumulating and distributing funds.

TUA holds 2yr futures with a target duration equivalent to 10yr bonds (~8yrs). No fund I know has more, but it is easy to implement yourself by buying the futures yourself.  \n\nhttps://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/us-treasury/2-year-us-treasury-note.contractSpecs.html That's the main one. It has $200k face value per contract. If that's more than you want there's also newer micro futures https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/us-treasury/micro-2-year-yield.contractSpecs.html  \n\nhttps://www.cmegroup.com/education/files/understanding-treasury-futures.pdf",

June 2023 contracts expire next month, so you would need to roll your position to the next contract shortly before then. Often people keeping a long term futures position will roll it quarterly (though it looks like these are only listed out for a month? strange).  \n\n2 The micro yield futures, unlike the underlying notes or the regular treasury note futures, rise with rising yields, so if you want to profit from a drop in yields, you need to sell it, not buy it.  \n\n3 One micro 2yr yield futures contract will rise $10 for each basis point change in yield, so $2000 for +200 bps rise. In order for that amount to be a 50% gain for you, you would need to have an account size of $4000. If your account size is $25k (which was the minimum account size TDA asked me when I opened a futures account, other brokers may require less), you would sell six or seven contracts to get a proportionally equivalent position.",

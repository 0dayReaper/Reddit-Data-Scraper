    "postText": "Hello,  \n\n\nSo in October of last year I decided to invest and diversify my savings pretty significantly. I was recommended instead to put all my money into an S&amp;P fund, however I have a family member that lost significant sums by putting all their eggs in one basket so I chose to diversify. Now IVE is up 20% against my overall 10% and I feel like a complete tool. I'm not complaining by any means, a gain is a gain and I'll take it, but I'm trying to understand if going forward it would be smarter to just invest in S&amp;P funds or continue to diversify. Any advice/experience/insight would be great! Thanks!",

The simple truth is that you won't get good returns without some level of risk.\n\nThis is why most people do some mix of stocks and bonds. How much of one vs the other is a matter of eternal debate and there is no one right answer as everyone is different. But generally most people will start off with little or no bond allocation and move more into bonds as they get older.\n\nI also feel its worth pointing out that \"risk\" isn't the odds of loosing all your money. Assuming you invest in a broad market index fund like VOO or VTI that can't realistically happen. Risk is how different your actual returns end up being from your expected returns over some period of time.\n\nBonds are super predictable, stocks are not. Hence bonds are considered less risky than stocks because you know what the return on a bond is going to be, its written in the contract. While stocks on the other hand can bounce around like crazy. If you wait long enough the stocks will probably earn more than the bonds but its impossible to know how much more. That unpredictability is risk.",

Your average returns will be very good, and you'll have money to rebalance with into troubled assets.  \n\nPicture two assets X and Y both flipping a coin independently of one another.  On heads the asset goes +30% on tails -10%.\n\n**X alone**\n* heads = +30%\n* tails = -10%\n* compounding = (1.3*.9)^(1/2) = **8.16%**\n\n**X and Y rebalancing**\n* both heads (25% of the time) = +30%\n* One tail, one head (50% of the time) = +10%\n* both tails (25%) = -10%\n* compounding = (1.3*1.1^2*.9)^(1/4) = **9.07%**\n\nVolatility matters.

If you are risk adverse then cd rates are very attractive. 4 to 5 percent is very good rates to have a chunk of money there and then have also some in famous tech stocks or S&amp;P. \n\nThe future says rates will come down and the future also says a lot of empty commercial real estate with very high intrest rates will make some sort of collapse on that area that could spread. \nLower rates also mean better emerging market outlook. \nAnd tons of random magic ball predictions. Ever heard of the South Park stock play? See new episodes of South Park and any product they mention the stock will rise like crazy later. So Japanese stocks might be a big one. I\u2019m into robotics and Japan has a lot. \n\nSo u see how risky things can really get for random predictions. So cd rates and the regular index funds or tried and true stocks could be safer.",

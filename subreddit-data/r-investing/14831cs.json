    "postText": "Hi all. I bought 450 sofi shares with an average cost basis of around 16$ over the past few years. Sofi has increased significantly, and I sold some to offset losses, but noticed my cost basis decreased to around 12$. Can someone explain how this makes sense? From my understanding, if a stock reached your cost basis, you are breakeven\u2026yet I was still significantly down and my cost basis got closer to breakeven. I use fidelity if that means anything. Thanks!!!",

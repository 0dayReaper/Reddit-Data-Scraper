    "postText": "In a recent note to clients, strategists from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) suggested a one percent portfolio allocation to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg, JPM strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho opined that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against fluctuations from traditional assets like bonds, stocks, and commodities. However, they advised clients to allocate a small percentage due to the risk of major downturns in Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nAfter setting a new all-time high above $58,000, the value of the digital asset slumped to less than $45,000 and has been struggling to recover ever since.\n\nChang and Ho told investors:\n\n&gt;*In a multi-asset portfolio, investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.*\n\nBitcoin has welcomed major investments from the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and MicroStrategy. The endorsement from JPM comes at a time when institutional players are rushing to accumulate the digital asset. As per Bloomberg\u2019s report, America\u2019s oldest bank BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has also announced plans to enable Bitcoin transactions for its clients.\n\nThe strategists were quick to add that cryptocurrencies should be viewed as an investment vehicle and opposed to being funding currencies like the USD or EUR. This appears to be contrary to earlier statements from other JPM analysts that called cryptocurrencies the \u201cpoorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities.\u201d\n\n[https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/jpmorgan-advises-clients-to-expose-1-of-their-portfolio-to-bitcoin-2431724](https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/jpmorgan-advises-clients-to-expose-1-of-their-portfolio-to-bitcoin-2431724)",

Gold, which is talked about all in this comment thread, can't be used as currency either (sure technically it can, but it never is, and in fact btc is used as currency far more frquently than gold) so shouldn't you be questioning why gold would store value? Houses can't be used as currency, why do they store value? The answer is because they have utility. \n\nBitcoin allows for trustless pseudonymous transfer of money without any intermediaries/third party, requirement of approvals etc, to anyone anywhere in the world, within minutes. It doesn't require X \"business days\" to transfer. There is no minimum age to use it. You don't need a certain credit score to use it. It doesn't take the weekends off.  You can transact it on your phone or computer, or you can store it securely offline, or even in your head.  It's on 24/7, even on Christmas and New Years. It's international, and cannot be restricted across national borders. \n\n That is absolutely a massive value proposition, and there is nothing in the traditional financial world that can compete with this. hence, it has tremendous value.",

The US stands to benefit by having our currency a sort of globally accepted currency. Lots of people in lots of countries like having those US dollars.  \n\n\nIf the US recognizes Bitcoin as a currency, and the easy of use and lack of regulation rapidly sees it's adoption, that removes US influence from the world.  \n\n\nIf the US and other regulatory bodies treat crypto as a sort of asset, some sort of tangible investable \"thing\", it takes away from that currency \"legitimacy\" - if it means anything or not to anyone, who knows?  \n\n\nI wouldn't be surprised though that there may be more at play behind such an IRS decision than just getting some tax money.",

It appears instant because of gentlemen's agreements based on layers built on layers on the concept of trading something for another thing.  Behind the scenes it takes days for the banks to reconcile the difference and send it to each other, and it takes up to a month for you to pay back the credit card company, if it ever does get fully paid back.  \n\nBitcoin is still in its infancy based on only being a single layer of a transaction.  Give it years for multiple layers to be built on it, like credit cards, lightning networks, more future tech and ideas that haven't been invented yet.  Lots of people are obviously investing in it to make a quick buck, but you can't deny the potential this could have to make a autonomous finance system and whatever implications it will have on the future.",

Literally, what initial price are you considering? $0.01? $0.0005? $1.00? This denominator is so small and has such an outsize effect on the result that \"all time\" gains are pretty much irrelevant.\n\nIf you say BTC is up 44,053 percent over its history, then the first price it must have traded at would be 1/440th of today's price of $47k, or $106. Bitcoin hit $100 for the first time in 2013 and markets were already well established. It had been $1 just a couple years earlier prior to the 2011 bull run to $32. It had traded far below $1 up to that point.\n\nI see Bitcoin's first documented trading price quoted around the internet as $0.0008 in mid-2010 after a year or so of functionality in which there literally was no known price. That would put it at 47000 / 0.0008 * 100 = **5,875,000,000% gain**.\n\nMaybe we use the 10,000 BTC for two Papa John's pizzas transaction as the benchmark for the \"first\" price. What do two such pizzas cost? $30? That would imply a BTC value of $0.003, and gains of \"just\" *1,566,666,666%*.\n\nLike I said, denominator so small it's irrelevant.\n\nBitcoin came from nothing. :-D",

So the exact reason it's a bad currency makes it a good store of value, like gold. There are some benefits over gold, although I agree it is lacking the shiny factor, and I do like some shiny. Still, most people that invest in gold will never touch the gold they invest in, so I don't think that's a real problem for bitcoin.",

It appears that, when the stock market crashes, bitcoin crashes even more.  Compare the graphs of March 2020 between bitcoin, and a stock market index to see for yourself. \n\nFurther, due to the massive amount of electricity bitcoin wastes (A lot of it is from coal power.) bitcoin doesn't belong in a world worried about global warming.  All of this massive computing power is being wasted solving pointless problems.  There are far less wasteful cryptocurrencies like XRP and ADA.",

Over the last year in particular my cryptocurrency %age has ballooned, and I don't think it's worth triggering a taxable event to rebalance.

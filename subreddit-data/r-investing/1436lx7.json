    "postText": "Since the bank turmoil in March, money generally flew from bank deposits to money market funds. So there is a huge inflow for these funds. I'm wondering how they are digesting it. Did treasury somehow issued a large amount of bills during this period? Is the Fed balance sheet reflecting this inflow?\n\nOtherwise, there has to be a seller of these funds, who are selling at this rate, and why?",

Other banks take parts of the holdings in the bankrupt banks. Money doesn't disappear if the bank falls, especially small banks, thr holdings are just delegated to be managed by other bigger banks.",

They're priced for total collapse right now.\n\nI think what a lot of investors aren't realizing is that work from home is dying. I'm in tech(one of the most WFH friendly careers) and most employers are now requiring at the very least hybrid.\n\nI think a broad real estate index fund is the way to go for diversification reasons. That way you get everything- residential, commercial/retail, cell towers, farmland/timberland, industrial properties, medical properties, datacenters, etc. VNQ is down 29% from its peak, and is still cheaper than it was 16 years ago despite significant dividend/FFO growth since then and less leverage than back then.",

Who is looking to do office building loans right now?  Insurance companies have pulled back, banks will do some but their terms will be tight and rates will be high.  Loan funds aren\u2019t typically low-price.  CMBS have been a big source of funding but that\u2019s not going to be much of an option.  Then, when buildings go into foreclosure and get bought for 40 cents on the dollar, the new owners will be able to cut lease rates to attract tenants, which then starts to hit all the healthy buildings as well.  You might be right that some of the REITs are oversold but from a fundamental perspective I think we\u2019re in about the second inning and it\u2019s likely to be a multiple year mess.  Personally, I would like to just avoid that sector right now for the most part until there\u2019s better clarity.  The only office REIT I own is GMRE which owns medical office buildings.  They\u2019ve been doing fine on occupancy due to the nature of their business but still have been getting hurt by rising interest rates and cap rates.",

I don\u2019t see a commercial real estate crash, or at least not anything like the doom and gloom I\u2019ve read on Reddit lol. I think that trophy assets and some of the better class A buildings will be better equipped to weather the storm. Office feels like it\u2019s going through a time to figure out which buildings are the \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots.\u201d A fair amount of these buildings that don\u2019t have reasons exist will try to be redeveloped into something else as owners and lenders sell to the next guys at a cost basis that works with the current debt market because good luck getting a lender to refinance a 60% leased office building at anyone\u2019s current basis.\n\nSo if you think that the office holdings in O are the buildings that are part of the \u201chaves\u201d group, then I think it\u2019s not the worst choice if you\u2019re planning on holding it for a while. Who knows when office will recover in any meaningful way so it\u2019s not without risk. I purchased a MF REIT early in Covid after noticing that rent collections were solid despite the headlines, furloughed tenants, and fear in the market so I think this type of consideration can lead to a good buying opportunity.\n\nHope this is helpful!",

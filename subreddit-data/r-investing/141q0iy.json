    "postText": "I am hoping to buy a house this winter and have about 10% of a down payment in cash with at least another 10-20% in stocks. Buying is contingent upon home prices being somewhat reasonable (at least going down a little compared to this summer). \n\nSince I'm not 100% sure I will buy this winter, should I hedge my bets and put more in the stock market and eat the taxes? IMO there are still good deals in the market and if I keep putting new income in my bank account then don't buy a house this winter I will regret it. How do people weigh this type of thing from an opportunity cost and also short term tax perspective (in the case I do buy)? Is there a good formula?\n\nI tried posting in r/realestateinvesting but haven't had any luck, so trying here.",

I should be able to earn enough new income over the next year to make up for it in the case of a loss of stock value (in which case I think I'd just treat the money i put in now to be long term stock investment).",

I want to buy a bigger house, but if rates and prices don't change, I could wait a year. I could target a down payment of 30-35% this winter, but if rates change a bit I'd love to put more in stocks and put 20% down. I just don't really want to sit on the fence with incoming cash if I don't end up buying due to housing market conditions.",

But beforehand trying to anticipate housing costs going down in 6 months, I don't think that's a winning bet.\n\n\nPrices have already adjusted down and the fed is teetering on ending these rate increases...I wouldn't rely on any more significant housing cost drops, barring a crash, which none of us knows if it will happen. \n\n\nMy advice as a nobody on the internet is to start looking now, if you have the money now, but be shrewd. Don't be hasty but stay on top of sales and wait for a deal to pop up.",

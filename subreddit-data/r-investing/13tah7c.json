    "postText": "in November 2021 NVIDIA with revenue of 7M$ reached price of 330$, now when their revenue in Q2 will be 11M$ the price is 390%. Plus now there is so much hype around AI, and it not just the hype, AI is much more real than it was in 2021.\n\nSo am I missing something for thinking that NVIDIA in 2021 was much more overpriced than it is at the moment?",

Like TSLA, NVDA has a lot of competition that are currently far behind them but well-funded and intent on catching up.\n\nBased strictly on fundamentals, I would sell my whole position on market open Tuesday.

Like AWS, they designed a bespoke chip for their system needs using mostly off the shelf IP.\n\nTo my knowledge Nvidia has exactly one design win for their Grace CPU that is *not* used in conjunction with their GPU products. That's awfully premature to say they could replace Intel or AMD or even Ampere. I'd say Apple is far better positioned to take over the server CPU market, if they so choose.",

Then the P/E number is of less significance because you expect it to normalise on a normal year. Such a company can easily 10x their current earnings. Because well, they had none.\n\nThings is that Nvidia is not in a slump. It's not a terrible year for profits and we can't expect the P/E to normalise. There is no 20x profits upside in reach. Nvidia is just plain overvalued in the same way Tesla was (and still is).\n\nNvidia is a good company but there is no way they can grow into the enormous shoes the market has made for it. I'm not just on about the P/E but simply making a glaring example of the scale Nvidia would need to be expected to grow to motivate the price.\n\nOf course, none of this matters as the market decides what something is worth. **Just be aware that Nvidia's price hangs on only one single nail: It's expected to rise, and so it rises.** That's a game that will sooner or later end.",

If they wanted to have a 20 P/E, they could accomplish that nearly overnight. But that's not the goal of these companies right now - it's revenue growth over all else.",

Sure they're turning their own silicon.  Any idea how it's going for them?   Let's use google as an example.  They're 5 generations in on TPUs.   They've invested perhaps 1-2 billion dollars with each generation.   And low and behold, GPUs are still faster, serve more use cases, and have a dramatically larger developer base.  Did I mention they're cheaper and more flexible too?   For $5B, Google could have the world's largest GPU cluster, 500K A100s or 166K H100s.  The amazing part is, Google is still one of NVDA's biggest customers.   And an ASIC's weakness is that they are static, it takes a lot of money to move to the next generation thing, this season its the transformer engine (the T in GPT), next season, who knows?\n\nThe bottom line with these CSPs is they may take some potential off nvidia's table (clearly not evidenced by demand for H100).   Nvidia will easily back fill that demand with other enterprize and cloud customers (ServiceNow, Oracle et al) and google and Baidu have severely struggled getting their silicon in the market outside their own data centers despite years of trying.  They appear as zero threat to Nvidia's merchant market.\n\nDid I mention the near entire AI software development world defaults to Nvidia's CUDA AI framework?    It just works.   Incumbency is the biggest problem any competitor will have challenging Nvidia's platform.",

But I\u2019m not banking on these gains lasting from nvidia.\n\nFor AI opportunists, best to keep an eye in who is buying up nvidia products for AI ramping, and taking a bet on if they can make a successful product. (Assuming their P/E isn\u2019t ridiculous also\u2026 )\n\nWhat would be great for nvidia, is if they can package a product for individual business (medium to large) to run their own AI tools for the internal efficiency gains ( smaller scale, larger deployment numbers), as opposed to huge servers providing services via apps, from MSFT, META and the like.\n\nRegarding the moat point, I think that would inherently be from nvidia developing APIs and dev tools for their products, not the products themselves. So far, their unique offerings are usually caught up pretty quickly, DLSS and G-Sync for starters. \n\nOf course, that moat would be torpedo\u2019d if an open source version supporting other targeted hardware from competitors were to evolve (seemingly, like it always has).\n\nAnd then there\u2019s quantum computing, always on the horizon\u2026 (and \u2018may\u2019 always be, but many are working on it).\n\n40-50 P/E would be a more comfortable investment opportunity for me, where risk is roughly in both directions, currently risk is only weighted on absolute success.",

The argument Nvidia bulls have is that Nvidia and Semis as a whole are exiting a cyclical downturn (2022) and entering a multi-year cyclical bull.\n\nMeaning valuations look stretched today but won't in 3 years. Of course, by this same logic that the economy is about to boom in 2024-2027 then Big Tech isn't overvalued either.",

This company is impossible to evaluate by traditional metrics.   I mean, yes, sure, you can apply FPEs and Sales to Earnings and DCF to the financials, but it really tells only a fraction of the story.  Nvidia has been over valued for 7-8 years honestly.  But to me this is a difference between long term investing and trading. \n\nI've been a long term investor because of two reasons:  the technology platform Nvidia has been building and the management.  Yes, understanding that is a lot to ask of traditional investors.  No one really cares about the speeds and feeds, and software stack, and competitive moats just whether they are going to make money or not.\n\nI love high tech investing for just exactly what happened, the incredible volume and the immediacy of the move, you don't get that trading commodity futures.  I had to wait an incredibly long time for what happened Thursday.    So does Benjamin Graham still apply?   I'm not sure, not in high tech anyway, it feels like a different world than it was 100 years ago.   \n\nMy reality is:  in order to understand whether a high tech investment is sound or not, one must really understand the broader landscape:  a company's solution, the markets served, market potential, the competitive situation, and the business management.   How can you get to an understanding of those things through valuation metrics?  You can't, you need to look a little deeper.\n\nNearly every time I've tried explain this, the down votes come flying in.  I honestly expect this comment to be no different.   Reddit I'm not sure is the best place to describe what I'm talking about.  My sense is most of the crowd just wants the sure thing, a 2 line tip of the day for a quick in an out.   That's trading.   \n\nInvesting is a lot harder than that in some respects, but much simpler in others, like exercising patience.     Young investors should know the biggest asset one has on their side is TIME.   And patience is about believing in your outlook.   I rode this stock from ATHs to more than 50% drops several times.\n\nThe reason the stock took off was the idea $1T in data center infrastructure needs to change out for a new kind of computing:  AI.   Nvidia has been saying this for years.  Was anyone paying attention?   Some were.    But was the advent of chatgpt that brought the demand to Nvidia's order book that became the catalyst for the investment community to really wake up to what the company is building.       \n\nHappy to say more or share what I know about the company and their strategy if there is interest.   \n\nOr there is the r/NVDA_Stock sub.  cheers",

It's a fairly large position covering both IRA and and investing accounts.\n\nBut for the record (and some hints on pricing):\n\n\\- my last outright sell was Nov 21 \n\n\\- my last outright buy was Oct 22\n\n\\- Yesterday I sold covered calls Aug/Sept for &lt;10% of the position\n\nPerhaps some deep in the money calls will get placed on a 1/4 or 1/3 of the position before year end for some downside protection.   Certainly I will take some gains this year but tax consequences are a consideration.  Ideally, I exit over a decade and truly, there is another 10+ years of growth in this company.  Whether Mr Market sticks with it that long remains to be seen.\n\nOne thing is for sure and that's that we will go through another up/down cycle (as semiconductors generally do) within the next two years.   My view is the bottom of NVDA's valley occurred last Oct, so we've still got many months of growth to go in this cycle.    The market could also be bifurcating with guys like Intel and QCOM left out and folks like AMD, NVDA, MU and AVGO winners.  Hard to know yet.\n\nMy commitment to myself is to fully exit the investment when a viable/serious competitor starts doing some damage.  Nvidia's horizons remain virtually unimpeded as far as one can see in high tech, so I wait patiently for that moment.",

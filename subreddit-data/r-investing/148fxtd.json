I was just not ready.\n\nThis whole time I had been working while investing every penny into responsible etfs. Biggest rule is not to mix investing to taking a chance somewhere. So I also did this while learning to trade.\n\n8 years later COVID happened so I changed my trading strategy. Now I trade 50-100k in options while keeping a lot more invested, while also working. This generates me an extra 200-300k, apart from work, and other Investments. \n\nMy biggest piece of advice is learn to hate losing, but also take your time. It took me over 8 years to be comfortable moving more than 10k, and it also takes discipline to know your limits.",

In mid-late Jan, there was like a 10% drop - \"I am a f-ing genius, rushed in to buy the dip\"; by mid March-April, lost $300K and got out it.\n\n  \nIt taught me a valuable lesson, max out retirement accounts with low cost mutual funds and save 15% cash of yearly income for emergencies, after that than purchase blue chips (BRK.B, HON, KMB) names and reinvest dividends.\n\n  \nThen and only then develop a \\~10 stock speculative portfolio that you did a lot of DD. For me, more than 10 are difficult to keep current.\n\n  \nIt also taught me to have a strategy on both the upside run and to manage downside risk (if any drop by \\~15-20% from my original investment dollars, I am out but will watch). After my initial lesson, I only purchased twice on the dip.\n\n  \nOn the upside, I take profits at 25% and if its 50%, I sell 1/2 - 1/3 and let the remainder ride and not really tracking it. (Today those stocks include META, AMD, and LLY.)  \nSo when the crash happen in 2008, I was well positioned and rode it out. Retiring early 8 years ago and been enjoying the good life.\n\n  \nToday, I have a speculative portfolio to keep my mind active. I will ride this crash out and look for opportunities for my speculative portfolio.\n\n  \nGood Luck.\n\n  \nPS: I purchased my house right before the bubble at a fair price. I am worried today that many people are getting over-extended by purchasing an over-priced home that they really cannot afford because they really want home-ownership.",

The mutual fund is in a Retail Account. The Pandemic hit and I kept my money in and bought 3 MSFT stock. Gradually over the year I saved money for a home and let the money sit, in 2021 I bought some risky EV stocks which lost me around $1,500. I then geared my investments towards Mutual Funds and safer stocks like AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, and MSFT. The gains on those balanced out my losses. \n\nWhat I learned was don\u2019t always buy into the hype, EV were hot because of TSLA and now it\u2019s AI. Invest in opportunity stocks or more into stocks that have done well for you in the past. I own 9K in Mutual Funds now mainly invested in Large Cap Equities and Growth and 5-6K in mainly Tech Stocks. I don\u2019t have money to lose in the stock market so I am focusing on safe long term diversified investments. Targeting Bank Stocks or Qualcomm. I constantly stay updated in the news and keep track of where the market is heading. I know I am not suppose to \u201ctime the market\u201d but I have around $1,200 sitting as cash in my investment account in case of a price drop in my current stocks",

            "comment": "I started with my 401(k) using index funds and was making 20-30% annually right away back in the mid 1990's.\n\nI lost money when I invested post-tax money in active mutual funds with an advisor, in a wrap account with front-loaded funds.    I didn't just lose money, I lost money relative to the market, even after normalizing for the load.  I fired the advisor and used the money as down-payment on the new house when we moved for my job.\n\nWith the recent pullback my portfolio was down 25% or so.   I held on, and have partly recovered.  I'm still down 15%.   Sometimes I've come out of pullbacks way ahead, but this time I'm a bit behind.  It happens.  If small/mid caps and international out do the S&amp;P, I'll be sitting pretty.  Given current P/Es, I suspect that eventually they'll pay off.\n\nAnd there is the key to it all.  If you have done the reading and research to understand your investments deeply, you will be far less tempted to sell when they're down.  A strong plan and the faith/will to hold when the market crashes will put anyone on a trajectory for solid long term returns.",

I never sold, however, and reinvested during 2018 and 2019 which turned out to be a good decision. I ended up making close to 50 times my investment during the 2021 crypto bubble and I did not make the same mistake twice. I sold the vast majority of my holdings before the most recent crash.\n\nCoping during the 2017 bear market was difficult. What helped me the most was knowing I had the correct allocation sizing for my portfolio. That is to say, I was well diversified in ETFs in tax advantaged retirement accounts, and I was willing to lose all the money I put into crytpo.",

It\u2019s thinking you can read meaningless trendlines better than other fools out there doing the same thing.\n\nStick to long term buying great companies with competitive advantages if you want to talk about actual investing.

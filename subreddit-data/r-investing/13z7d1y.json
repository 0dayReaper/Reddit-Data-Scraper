Also, i want to avoid the 10% penalty if i can. im under the retirement age. \n\nI had surgery last october and it cost me like 4k out of pocket. not sure if that will help. \n\nI was reading the future builder details and talked to a coworker and she said to try and open a separate ira and move the money and then take the distribution?\n\nI read about maybe asking schwab to open an IRa and moving the PCRA into it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnot sure\n\nanyone got a best route to take on this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nty",

            "comment": "What you're asking for is something people advise against. It's double mathematically a bad idea. \n\nUnless you're 59.5 years old, you will pay a 10% withdraw penalty. There's no way around this. If all the money is in the Roth portion of your PCRA, you wouldn't have to pay taxes on the withdraw. If it's in Pretax, you will pay taxes at your current tax rate. \n\nDepending on the defined rules of the PCRA, you may be able to withdraw the money or take a loan out which you can pay yourself back on over time. Note, that typical rules for retirement loans require you pay back the loan in full prior to leaving the company and many company's have a maximum loan amount (like 50% of the account value). Also from a quick google, some PCRA may have a minimum balance that must be retained. \n\nExample one: [https://www.savingsplusnow.com/tcm/savingsplusnow/static/Schwab\\_Fact\\_Sheet.pdf](https://www.savingsplusnow.com/tcm/savingsplusnow/static/Schwab_Fact_Sheet.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside of the \"how-to's\", there's something that needs to be said about the robbing of your future but also mixing money with family. This sub, and many other subs, will encourage you to not take the money out. Saving and investing in your retirement is a game of time. Failing to get in early and staying in for a long time will have direct detrimental impacts on your comfort when you're older. For example, the 7year-10% doubling concept. If the investment grows on average 10% each year, it will double every 7 years. If you're in your 30s, that's 4 doubles before retirement. Meaning, that $35k in 30 years will be over $500k just because you left it alone. Following up this point, you're robbing your future to pay down the mortgage on an asset that you do not own. While it's nice of you to help out a family member, it would be wiser to pay your brother a monthly rent fee. I know you're family but in this case, you are potential business for him.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would advise you leave this alone and figure out a different way to support your brother.",

I would rather pay this  thing down and off and then use interest free money to invest.",

And all of that extra cash flow now goes to retirement and investments. But, one thing to know, take your time and don't let emotions drive your decisions. While I don't take investment advice from Dave, I do like his mentality of thinking about your future. \n\nIf the loan is in your brother's name, you're still not liable for it. If it's in your name, you're already caught in the middle of the lesson about mixing money with family. I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this.  \n\nFor additional information about the PRCA, you would need to talk to your HR rep. \n\nDon't rob your future to fix today. I wish you the best of luck.",

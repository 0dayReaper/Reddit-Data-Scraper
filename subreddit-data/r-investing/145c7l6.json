    "postText": "I'm 32m and currently have \\~$37k in my 401k with a vested balance of \\~$32k. I'm feeling behind for my age so I adjusted my contributions. Increasing from $314 every two weeks to $625. My employer matches 50% up to my first 8% contributed so I have been getting full matching.\n\nA month ago I also \"finally\" opened up a Roth IRA and made a lump sum contribution of $6.5k.\n\nCurious to hear everyone's thoughts on this. If I should have increased my 401k Roth contributions or put that money into a taxable brokerage?\n\nThanks.\n\nEdit: I currently do not own a home but that is on the horizon in the coming years. I know a taxable brokerage I can pull from to use for housing down payment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: Should I be making some contributions as traditional 401k? Since all of my contributions are Roth I'm getting no current tax benefit?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 3: Holy moly thank you everyone for all of the feedback! I really appreciate your advice! I need to set some time aside and read the comments but I feel good about doubling my contributions!",

When you're just renting, or even better living with your parents, your expenses are so much more consistant. Once you have kids and a house, there will always be something popping up. You also have to act like the 401(k) is impossible to take out unless it's a matter of life and death. Far too many people ruin their retirement on top of the 10% early withdrawal penalty.",

I have a comfortable 7 figure retirement account and that\u2019s after paying over $600k in college expenses (I could have retired at 50 if there was no Fkn college).  \nI made 24k my first job out of college and never eclipsed $200k myself.  I did nothing special with my investing (though I did get lucky a couple times selling my home as I moved a few times).  But, like a lot of advice here, I invested early and often.  I got destroyed in 01 and 09, but still kept putting money away.\nIt can be done, children and all. It\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint.  Yes, invest as lot and learn to live on a smaller paycheck.  It will pay off",

Not much public transportation in smaller towns. It can be very affordable to get you going though. Many electricity/gas/water bills are not included and could run between $250-$500. My trash service is $25/month. I pay $45 for internet per month. Cable runs about $100 from what I hear, I use streaming services. Car payments range between $300 to $600. Car insurance varies as well and can be based off your credit score. Credit scores are important in america. It sucks but they are, they use them for or against us with interest rates, insurance premiums, rentals, and even some jobs.",

If not, lower it back down.  \n\nIf you don't have an emergency fund, get an emergency fund.\n\nYou're \"aiming\" for $22,500 of contributions (the max).  That's about $865 ever two weeks.  I mean, you might not be able to swing it and still make ends meet right now, but that's the goal.\n\nIf $314 every two weeks is 8%, then you make six figures, which means you're probably in the 24% federal tax bracket.  You're probably better off making traditional 401k contributions over Roth.  Switching to traditional will lower your apparent income, which will mean less withholdings, which will mean more take-home pay.  You then have the option of increasing your 401k contributions even further, closer to that $22,500 yearly limit.  You're over the deduction limit for traditional IRA, so Roth IRA is the way to go for now.  Once you cross some other income threshold, you might have to look into backdoor Roth for IRA (which is basically make traditional contributions which you aren't allowed to deduct, then immediately roll them over into a Roth IRA)\n\nIf you're saving for a down payment, work that into your budget.  Maybe that means lowering 401k contributions to build up a down payment.  That's fine -- just earmark the money so it doesn't go towards bullshit instead.\n\nIf you throw a down payment in a brokerage, just know that there will be tax implications when you liquidate for the down payment.  If it grows a lot, you'll get a hefty tax bill, or even worse, it might not grow.  Just saying when the plan stops being ephemeral and starts being real, you may want to move that money into more boring things like a HYSA, or a money fund if you leave it in a brokerage.",

And your *earnings* on the Roth contributions are considered pretax, so you can move the *earnings* only to a traditional IRA (basically losing the main tax benefit), or leave it in a potentially high expense employer Roth 401k.\n\nLots of strings attached to Roth 401k and I really suspect that low tier finance mouth breathers that most of us have access to simply don't understand the caveats for early retirement people. Also, few people in the Roth 401k era are retiring yet so it's possibly too obscure of a situation to be part of the mainstream discussion.\n\nAnyone feel free to correct me if I'm off base on any of this.\n\nEdit: Your Roth 401k *contributions* can be rolled into a Roth IRA without penalty. So not a big deal if you leave an employer after a short time, but a very big deal if you have been with an employer a long time and have a lot of gains.",

The account was funded with after-tax dollars, so you never pay tax on the contributions OR the gains (unless Congress moves the goalposts in the future).  However, I'm not a tax professional and it's certainly possible I don't follow what you're saying.\n\nI actually did this exact thing when my wife changed jobs a couple years ago.  I rolled her Roth 401(k) at her previous employer into her Roth IRA.  No taxes incurred.  We have no intention of spending any of it before 59.5, if that matters.",

            "comment": "Bottom line-- save as much as you can, as early as you can.  401K -- max it.  Some other general bits of advice --  \n\nLearning-- Recommend listening regularly to a couple podcasts a day -- The Money Guy, Choose FI, Investtalk, and Motely Fool (in that order, as your time permits). Countless youtube videos out there. Just watch one or two a day (no more than 5 or 10 minutes) and before you know it you will start seeing the big picture. Step 1 and 2 below is what you need to do in the next few days.\r  \n\r  \nJust my Two Cents -- You don\u2019t need to make investing difficult. It is one of the easiest things you will ever do if you follow the KISS principal. And if you are young enough you can easily retire well off. If you aren\u2019t young, it is never too late to help yourself. Two simple steps:\r  \n1. Take Action and get started. Time is your biggest friend or enemy in becoming financially independent. You can either waste it by not starting early enough (your 20s and early 30s are ideal) and/or throwing your money away on terrible stocks and other \u201cinvestments.\u201d Open a Fidelity or Vanguard account today. Either a regular brokerage or IRA. Most people have both. Chances are you may have done this step already.\r  \n2. Buy low cost, well diversified ETFs. Vanguard and Fidelity are both super cheap. I personally use Vanguard and would start with VOO and VBK. My four basic concepts below, again easy and straight forward, should be followed.\r  \nYounger folks- Now is a once in a decade time for you. Over your investing life you might see something like we saw in 2022 maybe five to eight times. Take advantage of it.\r  \nFour basic concepts you have to remember if you want to be successful in the long run in the stock market.\r  \n\u2022 The turtle always wins over the hare -- slowly but surely. Don't buy junk -- Most unprofitable tech companies and all Crypto falls into this category. Except with your casino/entertainment money which you are free to do whatever with including buying pizza, video games, cypto, slots\u2026... Remember, if you are in your 20\u2019s/early 30s, every dollar you use on a $4 Starbucks coffee is conservatively worth about $10.00 (30 years at 8%). Over my investing life (past 40 years), each dollar I saved initially is now worth about $36. Said another way, if I would have bought that $25,000 sports car coming out of college, I would have cost myself about $902,000 at retirement.\r  \n\u2022 Dollar cost average -- buy some every month regardless of what the market is doing. When the market was like 2022 and probably 2023 buy as much as you possibly can on a big down day.\r  \n\u2022 Diversify -- good cheap, broad market ETFs from Vanguard or Fidelity are great.\r  \n\u2022 Let physics or whatever heavenly name you want to call it be your friend -- \"COMPOUND INTEREST\" has no equal, except lack of time. A young person can get rich in 30-35 years if they follow these rules.",

I don't know where you live or what you'll need for retirement but I think going 20% if you can spare the money and catching up isn't a terrible idea.

If your plan doesn\u2019t have that provision you cannot exceed the annual contribution limit of $22,500 for 2023 regardless of how you choose to split the contributions.\n\nThat $22,500 annual limit is a total contribution per social security number i.e. you cannot exceed that amount but you are at liberty to split it across how many 401k accounts that you have including Roth 401k. This is why it makes sense to put all $22,500 into traditional 401k to get tax benefits.\n\nHowever, if your employer\u2019s retirement plan has an after-tax provision with an in-service distribution, you are able to then max your traditional 401k account with $22,500 for 2023 and still be able to put more money into your Roth by converting from your after-tax account up to $66,000 including employer matching and $22,500 annual regular contribution limit for 2023. This is what is generally called mega back-door Roth conversion.\n\nSo my advice is to max your traditional 401k first and then put extra funds in Roth 401k if your employer\u2019s plan allows for mega back-door Roth. Otherwise, put any extra funds in Roth IRA and taxable brokerage.",

Then the money that you were investing in the Roth can go to other investments that are only subject to capital gains.\n\nUse the Roth in retirement to reduce your tax rate when taking distributions from your traditional 401k in retirement. Also since traditional withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income a portion of your distribution is effectively tax-free as a result of the standard deduction.",

We don\u2019t want to be the heads of companies but we do know there\u2019s juice to squeeze on our current career paths.

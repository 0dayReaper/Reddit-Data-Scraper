    "postText": "Hi\n\nIt's a widespread fact that corporations in america especially retail companies, are dealing with a plague of madness roaring across the country called theft.\n\nHow on gods green earth can a company have a policy of not allowing their employees stop a thief or call the police???\n\nThis is pure madnes!!!\n\nWhy isn't this a basic culpable neglection of fiduciary duty towards the share holders????\n\nThere are reports of companies losing billion of dollars because of theft, and to add insult to injury, corporations have spoken out that they don't allow employees to stop theives!! In other words they have declared it's open season for thieves to come and steal from them!! \n\nIf the companies won't do anything, then I say it's time SH start a petition or start suing the hell out of companies who let their SH lose billions of dollars because they won't stand up to this madness!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#stopthetheft\n\n\\#stopthemadness\n\n\\#suecompaniesthatallowtheft",

A lawsuit of an employee killing (or getting killed by) a thief is infinitely more damaging than someone taking an XBox. It's shitty that crooks know this and rob in small amounts to stay under the radar, but that's company policy, and you damn sure aren't getting paid enough in retail to hunt down a thief.",

So LuLu Lemon employee - not expected to risk life and limb over theft; XE Contractor - expected to risk life and limb.   \n\n\nMy comment was purely a refutation of all these clowns' programed reaction of \"Stealing from corporations is ok.\" That sentiment leads to a further breakdown of order, which leads to further theft. First it was the corporations, then the local businesses, then your neighbor, then you, yadayadayada.   \n\n\nPeople might not like that point, but they'd like their stuff being stolen even less.",

That's what order and justice is, fair and equal application of the law across the board. While I don't believe we have that balance now, disregarding wanton theft from corporations while wanting justice for theft against an individual further destabilizes an ordered society.  \n\n\nAs for your possibly fictional sister dying in this wild and improbable scenario, no shit. I did not and would not advocate a retail employee risking their life over a fucking T-Shirt. However, I believe our society has a function specifically designed to prevent a scenario like this. You know, men and women who work a job where there's a consensual agreement that their lives will be under threat at times. The existence of this function is supposed to de-insensitive violent crime. In a society where this function exists, your hypothetical sister would hypothetically be fine and have a very low chance of having to interact with a violent criminal willing to kill for $10.  \n\n\nYou should watch a polisci 101 youtube vid some day, it would probably blow your mind. Or continue consuming whatever mindless dribble you do, pretending like you're learning. I'm sure that will pan out for you in the long run.",

Other countries with greater overall social integrity/morality and functional governments achieve impressive productivity on the global scale (profitable corporations) while still ensuring their society isnt being exploited.\n\nTldr; the fundamental purpose of a business is to make money, not decide what is ethical or not. Society/government should be responsible for deciding what are acceptable business practices in order to maintain an acceptable culture/society. Focus your discontent appropriately.",

However, would you agree that economic difficulties (ie poverty, reduced buying power/quality of life of the middle and lower-middle classes) are major contributing factors to the deterioration of faith in our society at large?\n\nLately, i have had the mindset that this deterioration in the faith of our institutions is largely driven by the growing economic inequality of our society. For many people, I believe the system is broken. For people at the very bottom, they can work, but they'll likely never be in a comfortable economic place. I think this has lead to a lack of faith in the society, which in turn, leads to increased crime as people are more desperate and feel the system is broken, so \"why not steal\"? \nFor people in the shrinking/tightening middle/lower middle class, this manifests more as lack of faith in institutions and political/social displeasure that allows populist politicians to rise to prominence (ie trump). \n\nSure, people can get trades training/an education to increase their odds of obtaining a better quality of life. But with the growing economic inequality in our society, people who arent management/higher up in a company or organization arent having wage growth that keeps up with the increase in the cost of living. As a result, fewer people feel that the system is working; they feel it at the store, when supporting a family, planning for retirement, etc. \n\nAnyways, sorry for the long post. Just working through some ideas; would love to hear feedback/pushback",

All those countries (ironically) have their own issues with conservative governments, I'm talking about the countries with liberal governments in the EU at the bottom of the list. You know, the ones with 1/3 the rates of poverty. \n\nCorrect. You are the problem. Not because you're privileged, but because you fail to see that you benefit off a system of extreme inequality, but because you're able to get a new granite counter top and have a \"live, laugh, love\" cutout on the wall of your manufactured home in suburbia, you will fight to maintain the status quo. \n\nYou're a good little soldier for the plutocrats, so you get some crumbs if you play nice. \n\nI'm hard working and successful too, but I had to go to war and fight brown people in the middle east to pay for my college. And, even with an income in the top 1% of my peers, and a masters degree from a top university, I'm still decades behind those who inherited their wealth from their boomer parents who raped our economy. \n\nSo, yep. I'm a socialist now. Whatever that means. I think homes should be owned by families and not multimillion dollar landlord conglomerates that outbid the market. I think you shouldn't have your life savings wiped out because you got unlucky and got cancer. I think you should be able to get educated without being fucked by insane loans for decades. I think teachers should earn a wage that is enough to support a family on. So, yep. Socialist.",

I didn't have a whole lot of stuff, laptop, a couple monitors and a few personal items (cups, water bottle , a few reference manuals)\n\nWe could not move our stuff. We had to pack it into boxes one night and they hired movers to move the boxes 3 rows down and move our monitors\n\nI thought it was dumb as it would have taken me about 10 min to move my stuff. However I was told it was corporate policy , if some one got \"injured\" moving it would cost 100x more then just paying a 3rd party vendor to do the move, they didn't want to take any chances.\n\nAnother issue is just cost/benefit you probably cannot expect a cashier to intervene and stop someone besides yelling at them. So you could perhaps hire a trained security guard but now you have to pay them , and pay them benefits , and hire multiple people ; you cannot just hire one and expect them to work 12 hours a day every day with no time off.\n\nWhat is the cost of hiring an extra 4 full time workers that need to get paid, have benefits, payroll taxes ect? And while they might stop some theft they won't stop 100%. Is it worth it from a cost benefit analysis?\n\nThere are also other cheaper methods to stop theft like locking up higher priced items, putting anti theft tags on stuff to deter people from stealing, video cameras ect.",

    "postText": "So I did some quantitative sentiment analysis to see if News websites/Reddit/Twitter panics before the stock market does, or if the stock market panics before Reddit/Twitter does.\n\nI have written an algo determining (stock specific) sentiment, I ran this on a dataset with (financial) news headlines (about 900k headlines), Twitter headlines en (stock related) Reddit headlines. From that I compared sentiment to the SP500 and I compared the intensity and volume of negative headlines to the VIX. This resulted in the two plots shown.\n\nSince the plot is somewhat full, I made it interactive so one can show for example only Reddit sentiment and zoom in and out of datapoints. This is in html, but Im not sure whether its allowed to share the link here so in case one is interested to play around with it shoot me a pm.\n\n[https://imgur.com/yUI2c0N](https://imgur.com/yUI2c0N)\n\nOn request,  interactive html is on:  [http://www.alternative-analytics.eu/dashboard/sentiment.html](http://www.alternative-analytics.eu/dashboard/sentiment.html)  (just a plain clean html, no ads, links etc, base url also is not a general website), I update the graph daily.",

Thus, all we need to do is measure the sentiment of the news headlines posted on reddit for today and once we do that the stocks will continue to go up. The only thing that can prevent this is another new pandemic though that will only have a temporary dampening effect",

They have a strong foothold in both the cloud and game consoles. This will drive growth throughout next year unless other market factors influence it. \n\nGPCPUs are are threatened in general by companies making their own chips based on RISC-V or ARM as we can see with Apple's latest announcements and I think the market will eventually go that direction soon. The end of Moore's law is forcing software companies to start caring about silicon. As a result, the market will likely split into ISA and foundry segments with physical silicon becoming a commodity. Foundries will operate on thin margins similar to other asia manufacturers while ISAs will become a mix of open/semi open solutions mixed with proprietary vendor specific items (e.g. ML extensions or something similar).\n\nI could be wrong of course, but this seems to be the way things are heading.",

We'll see, but they seem to have lost the battle on GPCPUs. Maybe this is intentional? They are certainly trying some interesting things with their purchase of Altera.\n\nGPUs are an interesting space. I'm somewhat on the fence here. Nvidia is certainly doing well right now, but as the ML space continues to mature, the similarities between GPUs and accelerators might diminish. Then again, I'm sure the fans of DEC, Sun, and IBM were saying similar things back in the early 90s and we see how that played out.\n\nAll in all, it's a tumultuous time for the high performance silicon. AMD is clearly a winner right now and this will certainly continue into the next year or so. Same for Nvidia. Intel may shock the world soon if they have something revolutionary cooking, but the last time they tried that, it failed miserably. TSMC is certainly going to be in a good spot for a while, but at the end of the day, they make etched glass. Not exactly a high margin business unless they start building some moats. I'm sticking with AMD for now and will be watching what Apple is trying very closely to see if it'll signal a shift for the industry in the near future.",

In any case, the negative sentiment avalanche was unprecedented and I\u2019d say those subs were good indicators of how people were bound to feel eventually here in the states.",

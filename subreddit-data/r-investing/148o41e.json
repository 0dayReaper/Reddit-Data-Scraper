    "postText": "In the future, I'd like to live off an SBLOC backed by a large portfolio built throughout my career. What are some good readings/resources for understanding an SBLOC? I have a range of questions, from how they operate to what kind of securities can be used. Can an SBLOC be backed by shares owned of an ETF, or does it have to be individual equities/companies (i.e $10M worth of Disney)? \n\nSay you take out an SBLOC for $10M at 1% and you have a portfolio worth $20M mixed between an ETF like VTI and a small handful of blue-chip names. When it comes time to pay the 1% do you just send an equivalent amount of shares as payment? Same for paying off the full loan? \n\nHypothetically, can you take out an SBLOC for $10M and immediately pay it off with $10M from portfolio shares and not incur a cap gains tax because you're not selling them, and now you have $10M cash?",

            "comment": "Each brokerage can decide which securities can be used for margin or a SBLOC. ETFs generally are allowed to be used as collateral.\n\nYou generally make payments in cash, either by electronic transfer or a check. You'll have a monthly due date and each month your brokerage will tell you the (minimum) amount due. \n\nIf you pay for something using an appreciated asset, you (as the payer) trigger capital gains taxes as if you had sold the asset and made the payment in the equivalent cash value. If for some reason you fail to make your payments (or in a margin account, get margin called), the custodian liquidates your assets on your behalf to collect the payment, triggering taxes for you.",

            "comment": "There are multiple ways this could be accomplished. This could be done with Margin which generally means no hard credit pull and is very liquid and you can sell securities at almost any time to close it out. \n\nAnother method is Regulation U Lending, this type will be a hard credit pull and generally is more sophisticated in its structuring and how much can be loaned. You\u2019ll have to talk to your bank/brokerage firm to see what their local policies are as some may exclude equity in what their house determines to be \u201criskier\u201d securities from Reg U but not from Margin. \n\nBecause each risk management/compliance unit will have their own policies what you encounter at one firm may be different than another firm. At best for Reg U I\u2019ve personally heard, which is anecdotal and not a trustworthy number, is maybe 50% of the market value of the staked securities. Margin depending on concentration requirements, diversification, etc can technically get maxed out at only maintaining 25% equity or something like that per FINRA/SEC but you have a high risk of getting blown out if the market moves against you if you try to maximize Margin. Many brokerages will set their house limits at 30% to provide some additional safety buffer if not higher for what they consider \u201criskier\u201d securities.\n\nTL;DR: Give your Bank/Brokerage a phone call to review your portfolio and then discuss Margin vs Reg U or whatever other offering they may have to see what is right for you. They will likely have licensed advisors who will want to review what fits best as well for your situation.",

            "comment": "Here is a sample agreement from Schwab: https://www.schwab.com/resource/pledged-asset-line-from-charles-schwab-bank.  BTW at $10m they would be SOFR + 1.9% so today's rate would be 6.9%.  A good margin rate would be cheaper, Interactive would be 5.58% on the bottom $9m and 6.085% on the first $1m. Schwab I think is about 6.75% for high balance margin loans (no way to check they don't publish that number).  BTW margin interest is deductible against short term gains / interest.  \n\nA SBLOC can be shares of an ETF.  Assuming the ETF is diverse the percent they will let you borrow very likely will be higher.  No you can't use shares for payment your payment is in cash and you have to pay taxes on sales.",

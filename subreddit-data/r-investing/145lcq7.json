He just lost his job and has earned $0 over the past year. If he decided to convert this to a Roth IRA instead, would the tax rate be 10%? Alternatively, if he decided to take an early withdrawal, would he have to pay 20% (10% tax + 10% penalty)?",

Assuming you are filing single and take the standard deduction of $13,850, your taxable income would be $86,150, and total federal income tax owed would be $14,260.\n\n&gt;Alternatively, if he decided to take an early withdrawal, would he have to pay 20% (10% tax + 10% penalty)\n\nYou can withdraw up to your total contributions at any time, tax free. The Roth conversion does not count as a direct contribution. If you have already withdrawn all of your contributions, then you would pay the regular income tax owed, plus 10% of the withdrawal.",

This makes coming up with the tax money challenging.\n\nI do wonder if this 'resets' anything.  \nFor example, in the roth, as you mentioned, you can withdrawl the amount you contributed, just not the gains.  \n\n\nNow what if you deposited 50k in a 401k, it grew to 100k, and then you moved that to a Roth (and paid the tax with other savings)   \nNow you have a Roth, worth 100k.  \nDoes it get tracked as if you put 50k into the roth?  \nIf it gets tracked as 100k, are you then able to withdraw all 100k with no penalty and no additional tax?",

In this example, the contributions of your Roth IRA would increase by $50k, and the rest would be considered earnings. If the rollover is from a pre-tax 401(k), the funds are treated as conversions. Conversions are withdrawn after contributions, but before earnings. If the conversion was at least 5 years ago, there is no taxed owed. If the conversion is less than 5 years old, you will owe 10% of the amount withdrawn (but no income tax). Of course, you will owe income tax on the amount of the conversion in the year of the conversion.",

However, this early withdrawal would then also incur further taxes, so this probably isn't ideal. So yes, you would need to come up with the tax money from elsewhere. You could also reduce the amount that you are converting to produce less taxes. If you only convert the $13,850 standard deduction, you would have no taxable income and owe no taxes, for example.",

I don\u2019t think there is a 10 percent early withdrawal for converting to a Roth account but you would pay income tax based on the amount you converted. If you leave it in the Roth account after converting this would give you several years of tax free growth!",

    "postText": "So I bought it in October of 2022. If I hold I for a year, and sell it in October 2023, what do I lose and how does that work? Im confused on the losing 3 months of interest. I bought it when it was at 9.62%. Also I thought the bond paid interest every 6 months? Was I wrong on that? I put in 10k and right now it says current value Is 10.4. So I\u2019m confused. Thank you in advance for the advice!!",

The value shown on treasury.com is with the 3 month penalty enforced. If you hold it for a year you can redeem it for whatever they value it says it\u2019s worth but that includes the 3 month penalty so the interest gained won\u2019t be the full amount.",

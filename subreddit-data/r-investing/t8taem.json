    "postText": "WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is willing to move ahead with a ban on Russian oil imports into the United States without the participation of allies in Europe, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to hold a video conference call with the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom on Monday as his administration continues to seek their support for a ban on the imports.\n\nThe White House is also negotiating with congressional leaders who are working on fast-tracking legislation banning Russian imports, a move that is forcing the administration to work on an expedited timeline, a source told Reuters\n\n**A senior U.S. official told Reuters that no final decision has been made but \"it is likely just the U.S if it happens\u201d**\n\nOil prices have soared to their highest levels since 2008 due to delays in the potential return of Iranian crude to global markets and as the United States and European allies consider banning Russian imports.\n\nEurope relies on Russia for crude oil and natural gas but has become more open to the idea of banning Russian products. read more The United States relies far less on Russian crude and products, but a ban would help drive prices up and pinch U.S. consumers already seeing historic prices at the gas pump. read more\n\nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a Sunday letter that her chamber is \"exploring\" legislation to ban the import of Russian oil and that Congress intends to enact this week $10 billion in aid for Ukraine in response to Moscow's military invasion of its neighbor.\n\nA bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced a bill on Thursday to ban U.S. imports of Russian oil. The bill is getting fast-tracked.\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine, the White House slapped sanctions on exports of technologies to Russia's refineries and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which has never launched.\n\nSo far, it has stopped short of targeting Russia's oil and gas exports as the Biden administration weighs the impacts on global oil markets and U.S. energy prices.\n\nAsked if the United States has ruled out banning Russian oil imports unilaterally, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Sunday said: \"I'm not going to rule out taking action one way or another, irrespective of what they do, but everything we've done, the approach starts with coordinating with allies and partners,\" Blinken said.\n\nAt the same time, the White House did not deny that Biden might make a trip to Saudi Arabia as the United States seeks to get Riyadh to increase energy production. Axios reported that such a trip was a possibility.\n\n\"This is premature speculation and no trip is planned,\" a White House official said.\n\nA year ago Biden shifted U.S. policy away from a focus on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is considered by many to be the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia and next in line to the throne held by the 85-year-old King Salman.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-prepared-move-alone-banning-russian-oil-imports-sources-2022-03-07/",

I thought that was the point of sanctioning the Russian central bank and removing them from SWIFT. Or did that only apply to their foreign researves and exceptions made for Russian oil payments. \n\nAlso does sanctioning Russian oil mean that all of its exports around the world will be sanctioned or only to EU/America. For example will China be sanctioned for continuing to import Russian oil.",

They need to refine tax laws to be fair about it, not just slapping an \u201cEV tax\u201d on those cars. Everyone who pays taxes relies on roads, and if roads are paid for by gas taxes that\u2019s not fair to everyone as only the gas drivers are paying the taxes. Cost of goods goes up when road taxes goes up too, truckers pay more for fuel and tolls. (and really, it\u2019s the heavy trucks that put the most wear and tear on the roads)\n\nI\u2019m more than willing to pay my fair share, but keep it fair.\n\nAs for the electricity bill, most EV drivers can charge during off-peak hours. So use the flexible rate schedule your utility offers to your advantage. When I switched to ToU billing, my electric bill went down by as much as it had gone up when I started charging a car every night.",

Less bitching, more transition off of oil and gas.](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/oil-dependence-and-us-foreign-policy)\n\nIf you can't afford an EV, optimize to reduce your oil consumption until you can. If you can afford an EV, **buy it**, regardless of manufacturer. The cost to operate an EV is half the cost per mile of a combustion vehicle (which adds up to thousands of dollars in fuel savings over the ownership interval, offsetting the higher vehicle upfront cost), and the delta increases as the cost of oil rises. Even if your local electrical generation is dirty (coal, natural gas), your EV will get cleaner over time as thermal generation is phased out and renewables are deployed. Combustion vehicles burn petroleum for their entire life.\n\n(my electrical vehicles are powered by rooftop solar, and all of this tech only continues to rapidly decline in cost if there is robust uptake)",

Example: own a 2016 Ford Fiesta, could absolutely upgrade to an EV. But that doesn't help the environment, nor my finances, and in fact it can help the environment more by NOT buying one now:\n\n1. Car gets used longer by someone who cares about it, rather than trashing a \"used car\" so it'll have a longer useful life, which then requires less cars overall to be manufactured.\n\n2. The car cost 14K, gets ~37 mpg. Use it for 500+ one-way mile trips, and can't take off work much at all more than I already do for those trips to family, so electric wouldn't work for that situation, nor is worth the money, due to such a lower entry point (30K &gt;&gt;&gt; 14K, and you have to factor in the compounding losses of that initial 16K...) And no, flying in a plane is not better for the environment, even divided by the number of passengers...\n\n3. So what about the environment? The car burns 3.06 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year, and another 20% for the transport and delivery of that fuel to the car, so 3.672 metric tons. If that was an electric car, powered off the grid here, that would be about 1.647 metric tons (12,000 mi / 4 mi/kwh * 549 grams per kwh / 1,000,000 grams/metric ton). So I have to make up 2 metric tons of carbon dioxide with about $10K saved from that decision. Or more like $1 K annually or so.\n\nWell, in the first year I replaced every lightbulb with leds, and redid the home insulation. The next, it went to a working heat system and thermostat, so the winter temp could be different at night than the day (62 and 68), that was a biggy, and took most of the E-car savings $$$. Those two alone get me close to the 2 metric ton savings, with the added benefit of further financial savings, so now I can funnel those funds possibly into solar someday or an EV when the time is right.  \n\nAlso, by delaying replacing the vehicle, the emissions saved on a new car, which total about 15 metric tons, typically, I can probably say it saved about 1/4 of that, so about 3.5 tons saved right there. \n\nI'm just trying to give a very detailed example of how just telling everyone to \"BUY ELECTRIC\" doesn't always save the environment any faster or help them either.",

These things pass as high prices reduces demand and people conserve, plus new supplies (very profitable) are brought online and gradually fill the gap.  The whole world can really do without anything Russia has or makes, it just takes time to do it. \n\nSo for now, everyone dedicate yourselves to using less energy, and only use it when needed. I just turned off the AC. You might turn down the heater or do all your errands in one car trip, or car-pool like people did after the previous energy crisis. Take public transport, bicycle and walk more.  And do not drive around aimlessly, leave the heat or AC on when you are not there, heat or cool the whole house if you are only using 1-2 rooms, etc.\n\nOther things you can do are don't waste food.  Re-use plastics.  Insulate your home. Buy more energy efficient cars and appliances.  Bottomline, if we bring our energy consumption down by 20%, which is very doable, then we remove the supply shortage caused by Russia and we are back to \"normal\" with a re-set.\n\nRussia's loss will also be others' gain. Maybe after10-20 years of terrible sanctions, Iran and Venezuela want to rejoin the world's economy again. All they have to do it denounce Putin, cut ties with him and improve their governments in terms of democracy and corruption. Then they can cease to be isolated as pariah states.  Lesser of two evils deals like this are all over the place, but the bottoimline is Putin must be defeated and destroyed, and so if all out war with NATO is off the table (unless Putin attacks first) then this is the best we can do, and Putin doesn't know it yet but he has already lost. Just a question of how many he will murder and how much damage he will cause before he is finally brought down.",

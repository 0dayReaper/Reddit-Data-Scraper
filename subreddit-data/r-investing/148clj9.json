    "postText": "Just won a prize for a lottery i didnt even know i was entered for. Received the money today and since its a good amount id rather invest it than spend it, my circumstances are as such:\n\n- Employed / Navy / \u00a334,500 yearly\n\n- I have an apartment that i part rent part mortgage already. I could buy the other shares or save up for a new place not sure whats best here. Navy offers Help To Buy scheme which is 50% interest free loan for deposit on a house so \u00a317,250 for me.\n\n- Time isnt a huge issue id like to see a decent return over 10years.\n\n- moderate risk tolerance, theres no need to put it all on a high gain high risk but also id rather see some returns in the near term.\n\n- no other holdings except newish mortgage\n\n- no debts save mortgage which is technically a big debt with a fancy name\n\nAll advice and discussion is valuable to me; please share your opinions freely :)\n\nEdit: to clarify the lotto is legit and benign, ive already received the money.",

It allows me to invest and grow with dividends and price appreciation. I can borrow against it at favorable rates as needed, while I keep ownership of the asset. Then keep growing it every time you get paid.",

You mentioned part of the loan is interest free, but is it all interest free?\n\n&gt;return over 10years.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;moderate risk tolerance  \n&gt;  \n&gt;id rather see some returns in the near term.\n\nthese three things are contradictory. my biggest concern is that you might invest in an index fund, and then it has a sudden drop or crash (very possible). Are you able to tolerate losing 50% in the short term, and not recovering for maybe 3-5 years? If not, you are not ready to buy stocks or index funds, and should stick to CDs and savings accounts that have a higher interest rate than your loan.\n\nPut it in a high yield savings account while you think it over.",

Its paid back from my salary within my future contracted years.\n\nPerhaps my moderate risk is a tad more conservative that what is generally accepted yes youre right i wouldnt be willing to lose 50% id see that as high risk personally. \n\nYeah ive stuck it in my savings for now.",

Not entirely sure what this scheme is so verify yourself.\n\nThat seems like the appropriate thing to do at this juncture, but just to give you a bit of food for thought for future savings: while stocks *could* drop 50% in a few months, the value of cash or bonds will *definitely* drop by 50% in 20-30 years because of inflation, which central banks clearly state they want to happen (at a lower rate than currently.) So, avoiding short term losses in this way guarantees long term losses.",

Did they send you a check and ask you to send them money back for \u201ctaxes or other fees\u201d?  If so, please talk to your bank before doing anything else. That check could be bad, leaving you on the hook for whatever you\u2019ve sent back to the scammers. Once again, hopefully I\u2019m wrong and you just got a nice windfall.",

    "postText": "As the title says - my 12 year old would like to begin investing his money. I think it could be a very good learning experience. Initially, I though I would just open a custodial taxable joint TD Ameritrade acct. When I started researching different accounts, I began to this about tax advantaged accounts. \n\nI am starting from scratch. It appears 529s are not exactly what I am looking for in this situation as the have only mutual fund options. (Correct me if I\u2019m wrong - I\u2019m in TN). \n\nCustodial Roth requires a child tax form proving income of said child? Is this easy enough for a good accountant? Would it be worth it for small amount of money?\n\nShould I just open a taxable custodial account for he and I? \n\nThanks for any insight.",

But kudos to your son for his interest at such a young age and YOU as a parent getting him started early in learning how to invest. If he likes reading you also should consider buying him some books on stock analysis. I wish my parents did this for me when I was 12. Then again I was probably more interested in playing Nintendo.",

There is nothing wrong with picking individual stocks for long term investing once proper analysis has been done on the underlying fundamentals of the company-their balance sheet, their profit/loss statement, debt to income ratio etc. It doesn't hurt to start reading about good analysis so that he can learn about quality companies he may want to invest in long term. He should probably continue paper trading while also learning stock analysis. In the meantime putting a few dollars in some index funds or mutual funds is relatively safe due to the diversification.\n\n I think what you are alluding to is DAY TRADING. That's not what we are talking about here.",

Retail investor's success rate is even less, fewer than 10% over a decade and more. What makes you think reading a few finance books and doing fundamental analysis by looking at some publicly available information can help you beat the market? i dont know if this discussion is stock picking or not, it is never explicitly mentioned by the op but i will argue against it if it is about stock picking and i will argue against it even if it isnt.",

Like if you are a foster parent and don't want the birth parents to have access to the child's money outside of qualified expenses. They shouldn't be the immediate thing you jump to if you want the best financial results for you and your child.\n\nUsing them for children directly impacts the child's expected minimum contribution on FAFSA in a negative way. You also cannot change the beneficiary of the UTMA/UGMA. And you lack the tax benefits of a 529. But, the kid actually owns the account which is really your sole benefit.\n\nYou're better off holding a position for the child in your account in your name. That gives them some control over the positions, proxied via you. A 529 gives the best benefits, and can later be rolled into a Roth IRA if there is cash left over. But, you will have limited selections, and kiddo doesn't have the same level of control.\n\n&gt; Limits on financial aid. Any financial assets established in a custodial account are a big \u201cred flag\u201d for colleges deliberating over financial aid to a student. Parental cash held in a state college 529 plan or an education savings account actually weighs less than a custodial account in a child\u2019s name, when it comes to colleges awarding financial aid. Student assets in an UGMA or UTMA account reduce eligibility for need-based financial aid by 20% or 25% of the asset value, much more than the maximum 5.64% reduction for a 529 plan account that is owned by a dependent student or the student\u2019s parent.\n\nhttps://www.savingforcollege.com/article/are-custodial-accounts-a-good-option-for-parents-saving-for-college",

However some states only provide state tax benefits if you use their program. The tax benefits are pretty significant depending on your state so it is worth looking into. However a 529 is *your* account, not the child's, you just designate the child a beneficiary.",

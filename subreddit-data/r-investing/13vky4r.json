GPT is eventually going to replace the entire chat experience for customer service and I also foresee GPT automating phone call trees in the future where a customer tells a GPT voice bot what they need help with and then the AI automatically provides either a response or transfers them to the correct department . No more clicking endlessly through phone trees trying to get your service questions answered!",

Like, let's say you want to build a vr history program that allows tourists to explore Ancient Egypt. You could prompt an AI to build several prototypes for you. Some of them are going to be total garbage. If you pick the best one you could ask the AI to make specific refinements to it until you get closer to what you want. This whole process could take a few hours. You could then bring it to your designers to turn it into a final product. This is the kind of thing Meta wants to do. If they actually succeed you could very quickly have a \"metaverse\" of virtual worlds that's as big as the internet. I think it should be clear that we're not going to have AI taking over hundreds of millions of jobs in the next decade but there are certain things that AI is going to be very good at. In creative tasks the AI does not have to be nearly as smart as it has to be to drive a car. It just has to provide scaffolding that artists can build upon.",

While completely ignoring IVR\u2026 IVR has been around for a while, and integrating LLM\u2019s will surely improve them. But IMO it\u2019s more evolutional improvement and not some crazy transformation that the fan bois are claiming.",

Current situation might be like 1996 or 1998.\n\nBack then Cisco was considered the golden boy of the network revolution.  It seems to have a parallel with NVidia today.\n\nThe market's valuation correctly predicted the major impact of the internet's development---years too early---but the specific companies were mostly wrong. Yahoo, Sun, Cisco, Oracle and Dell were the major players and infrastructure providers.  Facebook didn't exist, Google was a tiny startup like thousands of others, seemingly foolish to enter a search space which was already apparently well saturated and an old and tired play out of 1994 instead of 1999 (Yahoo, Altavista, lycos, etc etc).\n\n Other than Microsoft, but MSFT then was well valued because of a PC monopoly and stagnated for a decade or more because of Ballmer and sticking to that.",

If Sears and Barnes and Noble had good management back in 1998 there wouldn't be an Amazon, and Bezos would still be married to his nice first wife.\n\nEven inside machine learning community (I do this for a living though traditional ML not language, so far) the ChatGPT level of performance and especially its popularization were unexpected.\n\nFor a decade they were internal only tools and we saw academic papers being published and graphs on benchmark tasks go up each year, and that's it.\n\nThe cost to provide ChatGPT and equivalent LLMs on hardware is very high---even electricity alone without depreciation of the GPUs is high---and the willingness for someone to burn up their chips and investor cash for little revenue was also unexpected.  That will not persist, just like Uber and Lyft had to drastically raise their fares instead of subsidizing them with investor money.  The hardware and algorithms will be optimized for lower cost of course, the obvious commercially relevant plays are already being researched: lower performance than GPT4 but specialized to a sponsor's domain, and much less inference cost &amp; parameter size.",

There is no serious investment operation which doesn't use ML.\n\nThere is literally no equivalence between the two, except for the need to show investors that your business tries to leverage the latest \"loud\" technology. This yields zero insights into the actual value potential, and I'm getting headache trying to wrap my mind around your reasoning process lol. \n\nRe: hallucinations, if you have two functioning braincells and a computer, you can connect ChatGPT to google with python and the rest is prompt engineering.",

When I say \"create value\", I don't mean \"leeching on hype\", I mean create actual value for businesses. Various forms of \"ai\" agents will be omnipresent across the economy in a couple of years, ranging from simple seq2seq applications (because almost everything in the business interaction space is seq2seq) to complex frameworks leveraging language interpretation under the hood.\n\nI think its very weird that a consultant working in the domain doesn't see this written on the wall; I guess \"ai consultant\" is an alternative wording for \"tech consultant with some understanding neural network architectures\". Get creative, explore the possibilities that are arising. Think of how whisper can be combined with LLMs. Hint: that alone opens up an entire domain of value propositions.",

They're LLMs. Unless you have some bizarre definition of intelligence, and it's useful for something, you need to concede the truth: that we don't have AI. LLMs and other Ms are artifacts, and therefore artificial, but they're not intelligent. AI is artificial *intelligence*. We don't have it.\n\nModels are just equations. If you think equations possess intelligence, then I'd like to hear your definition of intelligence, and for you to explain why that definition is useful.\n\nMachines don't learn, and \"AI\" isn't intelligent. We have complex and interesting models, and they have recently become more complex and more interesting, but they're just equations, not intelligences.",

Which means that any company that wants to design a chip basically *has* to buy products from either or both of them.  As such, these stocks respond strongly to any mood changes in the market about chip production in general, and for quite a while now, that has almost always been upwards.\n\nAn increase in AI applications likely means an increase in the number and *variety* of specialized chips that need to be built, which means these companies sell more software licenses.  The day after NVidia popped, these two jumped 10%, and they\u2019re both up even more now, about 15% higher than they were early last week.",

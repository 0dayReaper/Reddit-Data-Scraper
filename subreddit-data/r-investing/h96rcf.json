    "postText": "&gt; My cousin in law was interested in investing. He opened a Robinhood account. And, he seemed to be enjoying the markets. As many of us do, or have done, he got interested in options. He believed he had \u201cno margin\u201d selected on his account.\n\n&gt; So, he began buying and selling options. Fast forward to sometime this past week and his account showed him owing $700k+. How does a 20 year old with no income get access to that kind of leverage/exposure?!\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/finance-isnt-worth-losing-your-life-over-the-heartbreaking-story-of-a-rookie-trader-who-racked-up-700000-in-debt-2020-06-14\n\nhttps://twitter.com/billbrewsterscg/status/1271802132979748866?s=21",

I would be working towards getting it to be a dischargeable debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy roommate in NYC was doing well for himself. He was an actor, and had booked some solid commercials for 2-3 years running. Made enough income to get access to lots of credit cards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell suddenly his dad got diagnosed with cancer, and he had to spend most of his time in Philly, so he was booking nothing. First he started out doing balance transfers to 0% cards. Racking up lots of debt keeping his NYC life operating while he was taking care of his dad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen one day he just said fuck it all, bought a top spec Apple macbook, and Mac Pro plus 3 tickets to Amsterdam, and all the lodging/fees etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe ran it all off his cards as long as he could, and then eventually just realized the hole he was in, and declared Bankruptcy.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is when we were 23, and it did haunt him for a while, but at the end of the day he got them to write down $50,000+ in debt, and he is chilling as a homeowner with good credit these days.",

The amount of bullshit I put myself through in order to save that amount up was the hardest part. I lost time and memories I could of had in hopes of being able to make my family's lives better. I lived in the ship I worked on. Never went out with friends, always said no to everything, and genuinely felt depressed and miserable all the time just so I could pull my family out of poverty to lift their spirits. 2008 happened when I didn't fully understand the downside of margin. I was in the middle of the ocean on deployment unable to manage my assets since our ship turned off internet access due to some security reasons, and when I could finally see my portfolio I had about 1200 left. When I got home I spent it on liquor and tried to drink myself to death. I'm just now getting back into the market with a couple thousand and am still financially hurt by what happened then =/ I learned a lesson that day though, and tell anyone thinking of using margin to stay away from it.",

Margin is quoted in % terms because the margin is the % of the portfolio balance the investor puts up. A lower margin % means a larger % covered by a loan. \n\nFor margin your initial leverage can be as high as 1:1, or 50% margin. Margin calls occur at 25% margin, of 3:1 leverage. Those are reg-t limits. Brokers may have more strict defaults than that. \n\nBy utilizing options and margin you can increase leverage substantially assuming your broker authorizes that behavior in your account. Additionally some brokers allow trading of leveraged funds on margin.",

Users of Robinhood Gold are selling covered calls using money borrowed from Robinhood. Nothing wrong with that. The problem arises when Robinhood incorrectly adds the value of those calls to the user\u2019s own capital. And that means that the more money a user borrows, the more money Robinhood will lend them for future trading.\n\nI would have assumed they fixed it but it's possible that another vulnerability was found, or maybe they really did lend a 20yo $700k.",

He can borrow it from someone else or ask his mom, you most likely will get your dollar back because you know he has it. 10k? Good luck asking from a kid for that back. Matter of fact, why would YOU lend a kid that much money to begin with. You really thought he had the ability to pay you back? You kinda fell into that one yourself.\n\nA bank who lent out that much money should know the risk or have some sort of collateral to begin with. For them to not be able to get that much money back, they're either a fool or got played. Either way, they need to figure out what went wrong themselves.",

The only reason I can think that he'd be allowed or at least seem to owe that much is if he was selling spreads and got exercised.\n\n&gt;Often when one leg gets exercised your brokerage balance will look way off for a day or so until they auto-exercise the other associated option in the spread to cover you as the trade settles.\n\n&gt;So if that ever happens to you, let your account settle first, or at least call your broker, admit you're a newbie dumbass, and ask what's going on. Because it's likely something that was a mistake on their end - they're going to liquidate your account before allowing someone with no credit to owe them $10k, much less $700k\n\nRobinhood probably doesn't want to comment because they don't want to talk about how the interface sometimes shows very large incorrect numbers that don't reflect your exposure, not because some kid *actually* got a $700k loss past them.",

Since margin buying power is 1:1 with cash and equity value, this oversight also increased your margin buying power.\n\nSo basically he'd buy 100 shares of some highly liquid stock (I think it was $AMD in this case), and then sell a covered call contract on it waaaaay in-the-money. Doing this would net crazy premiums, and due to the glitch, would add an equal amount of premium to his buying power, which he could then use to buy 100 more shares of AMD and then do it again. This allowed him to leverage up effectively 30-to-1 using AMD covered call premiums, which he then promptly used to buy long puts against $AAPL, right before their earnings.\n\n$AAPL promptly went to the moon and his puts were worthless, bringing his comically leveraged account balance well into the negative five or six figures.\n\n---\n^edit: ^a ^word",

RH will show you owe the full short assignment, even though you have a long position protecting you. So if you are short a $300 call, long 301, and the price goes up to 302, when you\u2019re assigned RH will say you owe 30k (300x100) even though you have the long call protecting you (you really owe $100).\n\nIf I had to guess, the reason they do this is because they immediately charge your account 30k to cover the short, then they assign the long protection, but it takes a day to process, so on their side they give you the 30k margin until you\u2019re credited with your long execution. But idk maybe I\u2019m wrong. Highest score I\u2019ve ever gotten was around 2.5 mil.\n\nSad that the kid killed himself for what was almost certainly not as bad as he thought though.  I\u2019m almost sure he wouldn\u2019t owe anything after the fact, worst case scenario he only lost his entire account value.",

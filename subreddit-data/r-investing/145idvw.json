    "postText": "Schwab is my broker and I just tried to buy FXAIX but there's a $2,500 minimum so I went with SWPPX instead. Are these funds only a no minimum if you are loyal to the broker (you use that specific brokerage). From looking into it, it seems there's no minimum investment for Fidelity users. Just a curious question from a new investor.",

May just leave it alone or you can open fidelity and transfer also. Do you like Schwab as a brokerage that could help you decide if you need to open separate fidelity account.",

There\u2019s a fee as high as $75 to buy Fidelity mutual funds at Schwab but no fee to sell them.\n\nI\u2019d suggest finding ETFs that fit your needs instead of mutual funds that carry transaction fees. You could switch to Fidelity if you really want, but there\u2019s an ETF for every random investment idea already.",

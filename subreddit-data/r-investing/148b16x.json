By being foolish and listening in the past I have missed out big time, should have gone with my gut and made my own mind up.  PayPal has risks from competition.  What people forget is, it best last earnings by a fair margin and also they are aggressively buying back shares.  \n\nFor the inevitable down voters, do what you want I don\u2019t care.  But I hope you enjoy the moment, if this does rip after you\u2019ve tried to convince people not to cash in on an opportunity based on shallow reasoning.  Every time I have seen an opportunity in the market, Reddit craps all over it.  Make your own mind up.  Inverse Reddit has proven excellent for me recently \ud83e\udd23",

PayPal also has its own difficulties to find the next massively popular service while the current service is quite saturated.

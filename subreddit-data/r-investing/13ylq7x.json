    "postText": "I read last night the treasury is issuing a 1-day bill, and the yield is over 6%. i couldn't find the option to buy the bill on treasury direct. It appears you cannot buy this directly from the US Treasury, and instead have to buy thru a brokerage?\n\nI have a schwab account and an ameriprise account. I also have a RH account. Is there some place I can buy this? did I miss the boat and they are already bought up?\n\nany help on how to buy this quickly would be appreciated. I have some cash I would love to cycle thru the opportunity, but the auction is TODAY, so I may be too late?\n\nhow do I buy this thing?",

If the dealer doesn't make it available to a broker's inventory - it may be unavailable.\n\nI won't expect retail brokers to carry these 1 and 3 day CMBs since retail investors aren't likely to bother with them.\n\n\\[edit\\]\n\nI just checked a few brokers like Merrill, Schwab, and Fidelity and I don't see the 1 day or 3 day CMBs available.\n\nFwiw - the 1 day CMB auctioned at 5.145% and the 3 day was 6.256%.\n\nThe 1 day CMB really isn't worth it - imo.\n\n\\[edit\\] - in case anyone is curious about the auction results of these 2 CMB tranches.\n\n[https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2023/R\\_20230602\\_1.pdf](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2023/R_20230602_1.pdf) \n\n[https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2023/R\\_20230601\\_1.pdf](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2023/R_20230601_1.pdf)",

[I don't see any 1-day TBill auctions available.](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/auctions/upcoming/)\n\nIf it does exist considering this... I'm a lazy man, and prefer to use a single platform (which is E-Trade for now), but something worth noting about buying TBills bills: If you pull that money out of an HYSA into a brokerage account for the auction that money may be \"dead\" (not earning interest) for like 3 days. \n\nThis completely invalidates the point of buying a short term T-Bill. I think Treasury direct has a system in place that lets you take money directly out of a HYSA avoiding dead periods.",

I am making more money on my treasury bills than an HYSA pays. all over 5.5% currently, and, unlike HYSA interest, not taxed at the state level. I wish i could buy via treasury direct, but i don't see how. in any event this money is leftover in my BofA account making pretty much zero because I bought a house recently and didn't end up having to spend as much as I budgeted for. Alternately, I could use the money already in my Schwab, Wells Fargo, or Ameriprise accounts to buy. I just want to know if those brokerage platforms CAN buy this instrument.\n\nI am not asking for your opinion on whether I *should* buy this instrument. I am asking for people who know to tell me *how* I can buy this instrument. not interested in your opinion on whether it's a good idea, just want to know how to buy. you don't know, that's fine.",

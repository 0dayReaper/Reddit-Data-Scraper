Whether you like something or not has no bearing on what the general population thinks. You cannot get these two things confused.\n\nAlso I don't think you mentioned anything about moats or future defensibility. All the information you mentioned is basic stuff that everyone knows about, it's already priced in. In order to do well you need to actually think about the future.",

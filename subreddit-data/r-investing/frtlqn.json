Also low interest rates mean servicing costs are very low.  That's great for a crisis like this.  If maturities are still years away servicing costs are all that really matter right now.\n\nI know debt is a scary word, but corporate debt should be viewed very differently from student loan or credit card debt.  Having a health amount of corporate debt is ideal for optimizing asset valuations.  As companies grow and interest rates are low, you want a larger mix of corporate debt.  It's not some scary nebulous thing.",

If you're doing day trading, then maybe you can ride certain shorter term trends, but the entire economy of the world is going to contract in a totally unprecedented way, and it's kind of stunning that even here people are still trying to rationalize the market.\n\nThe market isn't rational, it isn't logical, it isn't real prices. It doesn't represent real value. Because entities and people with extremely large buying power and very sophisticated systems have so much control of it that it's absurd.\n\nMy lesson from this whole ordeal isn't about market risk, exposure, the Fed, etc. It's about just how much control a small number of people have over global markets. It's about just how much capitalism has turned into a religion for some people, even encouraging others to go die so that stock prices don't drop.\n\nI have always been cynical, but I didn't think it was this bad underneath everything.",

If you could see a hypothetical real-time PE ratio of the market right now (and by 'real time,' I am referring to their earnings TODAY), the market would be trading at or near historic highs. With the number of companies whose earnings would be negative right now, we might even rival the market PE ratios of the 2001 bubble. The idea that you can give a company money and that it is able to turn around and profit from that money you gave it right now, just doesn't apply to the vast majority of companies. And it will remain to be that way until we come out of lockdown at best, and possibly even until we get a vaccine.",

We live in a time of total fiscal irresponsibility. These old fucks won\u2019t be in office when this blows up. Tragedy of American markets occurring right now before our eyes, and the poor that rely the most on the dollar will be hit the hardest by stagflation down the road. I hope an investigative finance person digs through all this and brings charges one day if there is any basis for it. Its collusion and would be illegal if it wasn\u2019t literally the government and wealthy elites doing this. The market deserves to dip from time to time, especially with all the shady shit that goes on and junk bonds and stock buy backs etc. This crisis is just a further stunt enabling the wealthy to become even wealthier, because their stocks will just keep going up while dollar value will be decimated.",

One way to think about how to bound this estimate is to take the Famiglietti-Leibovici-Santacreu number minus 10 million (workers in education and health care, who are less likely to be laid off) as an optimistic estimate for the number of layoffs during the second quarter and the Gascon number as a more pessimistic estimate. This results in unemployment rates between 10.5% and 40.6%.",

I'm not saying to invest everything into these stocks, but is there anything wrong with investing 1-3% of my account into these stocks and waiting for a pop?  It wouldn't be an essential part of my portfolio and it wouldn't hurt my portfolio if they all went to zero.\n\nThoughts?",

At least there will be a reason for flushing your money down the toilet.",

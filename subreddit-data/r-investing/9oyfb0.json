If they don't start tooling up soon, they're going to fail.\n\nThe Volt is kind of a funny beast. Sometimes it seems like it's gaining traction, then sometimes it doesn't. But what I can't tell is how much of that is the car itself, and how much is market demand.  Are there any competitive all-electric models? It seems like the water is muddy because the competing models are hybrids with all-electric as an option. Hard to compare sales figures in that environment.\n\nNot advocating for GM or the Volt from an investment standpoint. Just trying to make sense of the EV market. ",

I got a used 2015 F150 4x4 Lariat.. if I knew how bad Sync was, I would've gotten a 2017 or later model where it was replaced with Apple.\n\nMeanwhile.. I have a full-size truck that is very responsive yet good on gas. A 0-60 time of 5.6 seconds is damn good for a truck averaging 17mpg in stop-and-go traffic. Also, it's got all sorts of features they thought of that make getting work done so much easier.. like tailgate lighting, or the way you unlock the truck\n\nI'm pretty sure my next truck will be a Ford F150.",

Premium truck sales plummet in a recession, and our economy seems to be on the brink of one. \n\nFord's trying to execute an $11B restructuring and pivot to electric/autonomous vehicles, tariffs already add an additional $1B of operating expenses, and if Ford has to start dipping into its bank to pay dividends, the stock will tank so sharply and so dramatically that it would take you decades to earn enough dividend payments to recoup your losses. \n\nFor income, I invest in companies like AT&amp;T; they've got a lot of debt right now, but their customers pay monthly and absolutely depend on what they provide.",

Elon's purchase should actually help minority stockholders, since the 20 million he put it should counter the stock he receives in exchange (assuming, of course, that he purchased it at a fair value [he purchased it at market price, which is generally presumed fair]).\n\nEasier way to think about it: say a company has 10 issued shares, 10 treasury shares, and is worth 10 million. You have one share, majority shareholder has 9 (to eliminate questions about control). Majority shareholder buys 1 of the treasury shares for 1 million. The company is now worth 11 million, and your voting power went down, but the value of your stock actually went up (to 11/20 million from 10/20 million). This is of course assuming that share value is based on actual value, which is a big assumption. \n\nThe issue comes more when issues such as control are at stake or if Elon decides to liquidate a large amount of stock. Such things tend to distort stock price away from the actual value of a company.\n\nThe SEC action is why Elon is making the purchase, but doesn't affect it directly.",

Effectively, Musk is paying today, and shareholders are paying down the line (when Musk sells his shares - either on the secondary market, or more likely these are treasury shares and he will sell them back to Tesla, reducing Tesla cash and shareholder equity).\n\nEdit: it's almost not worth mentioning since the figure is small peanuts but this is probably the most tax efficient way to do this. Tesla gets $20m injection and writes off $20m on their taxes, resulting in a deduction even though cash position hasn't changed. A donation would likely have to be booked as income.",

If they raise funds from the market, that means they likely have liquidity problems. If they raise funds from Musk, that just means Musk is making a gesture.\n\nWe don't know if Tesla has liquidity problems (we'll see in the financial report), and their cash reserves stay stable.

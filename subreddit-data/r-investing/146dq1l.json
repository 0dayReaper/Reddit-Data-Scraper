    "postText": "I currently have a position in DGRO but have been contemplating replacing this with DIVO. While DIVO lags DGRO in price appreciation, it more or less equals DGRO in total return. DIVO'S starting yield is much higher and it's dividend growth will ensure a much higher yield on cost when I plan to retire in the next 7 years. Does it make sense at my age (59) to keep DGRO for the capital appreciation aspect or switch to Divo since I don't have 20+ years to wait for DGRO'S dividend to grow?",

            "comment": "I'll assume this is a taxable account, so I can try to answer your question.  Let's also assume your income will be much lower during retirement.  Both of these funds have similar returns, although you need to be careful there, because often 'market total return' usually has a baked in assumption of dividend re-investment, which you may not be doing.  A very important consideration with income generating funds.  Anyhow, both funds have similar metrics, sharpe ratio, r2, etc... So it really comes down to, do you want more yield or more growth?  Since yield is taxable, I'd probably go with DGRO, then switch over to DIVO once you retire.  Hope this helps you make an informed decision.",

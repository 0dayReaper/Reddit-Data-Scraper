    "postText": "Hi\n\nI'm trying to find a reliable source  exclusive to the semiconductor industry that compares each player in the field. \n\nI have a pretty good idea of what companies exists and the market cap etc etc but what I'm lacking is being up to date with each company project pipeline. And its time consuming going through each and every one of them.\n\nIs there any news analysis source that would be able to do a comparison between them ? I'm not interested in the technicals but more like an overview.\n\nFor example\n\n**Analysis**\n\nCompanies pipeline project for AI chips : NVDA with project A , AMD with project B , Qualcomm with Project C\n\nCompanies pipeline projects for AR chips :  ........ (you get the picture)\n\nThank you :)",

            "comment": "Sorry to say it this way but you really shouldn't. You should just get SOXX or SHM and enjoy your 5% industry growth YoY. No matter the hype cycle, that's what happens in semiconductors. Just in the last decade, it was 5G, self driving, crypto, and now AI. To put it bluntly, it's a mature industry with a lot of immature executives. There are 200 companies in the US alone (used to be more like 2000).\n\nAnyway, if you want to get familiar with the industry, I like \"The Circuit\" podcast (https://thecircuit.fm/). Fabricated Knowledge is interesting (https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/).",

Consisting of the 20 largest conpanies in the industry (Nvidia, asml, broadcom, TSMC etc). It\u2019s only available in Europe I think, not sure about the US. \n\nI\u2019ve been working in the semiconductor industry for many years now. It\u2019s really best to follow the biggest companies, rather than following individual ones. \n\nThis way you don\u2019t have to follow news of specific companies, but about the industry in general. Makes life easier :).",

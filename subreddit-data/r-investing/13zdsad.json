But I still wish to keep some passive exposure to the market and not miss out entirely on what I expect to be a bull run for more or less the rest of the year.\n\nMy idea is that I'll use a much smaller dollar amount and put it into 2-3X SPX mini futures and hold for at least the rest of the year until I've accumulated more capital from my salary income. \n\nThat will give me similar leverage as my current index fund hodings and no fees (except the bid/ask difference when I enter and exit). Obviously I'll lose money faster if I'm wrong on my general prognosis, but are there other downsides to using mini futures in this way?",

            "comment": "I'm guessing you're talking about /ES or /MES because SPX is not a \"futures index\". SPX is the S&amp;P 500 index upon which cash-settled options are traded.\n\nFutures are traded (i.e. not really \"investing\"), and require maintenance margin. A sharp move against you, and your broker will place you in a margin call and begin liquidating your portfolio if you don't have additional capital to cover.\n\nIf you don't know what any of this means, I would just stop and rethink what you're about to do. Futures are advanced financial instruments and carry high risk.",

The futures I already use (my broker calls them \"mini futures\", e.g. \"mini long sp500\" and the underlying is the SPX) for trading are not leveraged against any other holdings. Max loss is the cash I put into them and they range from X1 to X50 in leverage. As I understand it, the \"leverage\" in this case just means profits and losses on the cash input are amplified.\n\nThat said, I appreciate the concern and yes, I'm going to talk to a professional before opting for this strategy.",

Also - futures aren't perpetual.\n\nIt looks more like a leveraged index fund with a built-in stop loss to account for max loss. So, instead of a margin call, the position automatically liquidates.\n\nIt's not a product that I've seen before - so it was interesting to see it. ~~These types of products are not available in the US because like CFD's - they are likely not legal because the counterparty is the broker and it's an unlisted product.~~\n\n\\[edit\\] - the underlying may actually be exchange traded futures.",

I was just looking a bit more since the product is different than what is available in the US. The underlying mini-futures are actually exchange listed in Sweden. But the product specs are in Swedish so I can't actually figure out how they work compared to futures in the US.\n\nWhat's not legal in the US has to do more with the entity offering the securities and how revenue is generated. Because CFDs are over the counter and broker offered - it poses a conflict of interest under US law. Brokers in the US have to be \"brokers\". Brokers also are not banks and must manage their balance sheets and separate accounts differently.\n\nBTW - the mini-futures in Sweden including some of the option products are actually exchange traded products offered by Nasdaq. I don't know who is offering the US equity index products though.\n\nI'm sure that you could use these products for investments - but they are not intended for inexperienced or passive investors. These types of products generally have to be hedged and/or actively risk managed.\n\nWhat I can't tell if the stop loss is a feature of the exchange traded product or if it's a feature offered by the broker as some sort of risk management mechanism.\n\n\\[edit\\] - link to the Nasdaq site on some of the offered products - [https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/nordic-equity-derivatives](https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/nordic-equity-derivatives)",

The idea of using futures this way is similar to how many people use leveraged strategies. \n\nYou have to bear in mind that there is usually some kind of financing costs which are inherent in leveraged investing strategies. \n\nAgain - because these products are different than futures products in the US which I am more familiar - you may have to size and manage the positions differently than the way that a US investor may size futures listed in the US. \n\nSome differences include the stop loss that we discussed and that these products do not appear to expire (which makes it simpler to manage). Also - from what I can tell - there is an interest financing costs which I think accrues daily (about 3% annually) - depends on whether I read the Google translate correctly.",

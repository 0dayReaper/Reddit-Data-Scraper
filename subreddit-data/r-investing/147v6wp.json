Which doesn\u2019t make sense, its hypocritical if thats the right word to use. \n\nThere is a learning process for everything, and people don\u2019t understand that with stocks. It can be years until you make consistent profits. Losing money can be part of the learning process, also may build mental strength. \n\nIf it was I was making money in the casino everyday would that still be considered gambling? \n\nCasinos do not involve math or calculations. They don\u2019t involve charts, financial info, etc. There are strategies people may have, but it\u2019s nothing compared to trading. \n\nI guess trading is only gambling if you\u2019re losing money.",

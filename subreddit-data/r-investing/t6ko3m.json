We strongly support a lasting ceasefire and a settlement of problems through serious negotiations and diplomacy,\" the board added.\n\n---\n\nIt will be interesting to see if anything happens to management.",

The only way this can end well for Russia is if they Ghaddafi Putin, setup a temporary transitional government and have open and fair elections. Unfortunately that probably won't happen even if Putin \"falls from window\", so his lasting legacy will have been making Russia in North Korea in record speed.",

The West will do whatever it takes to ensure any sort of Russian administration of Ukraine does not work.  *If Iran could make the US's tenure in Iraq a living hell, there's every reason to think the West can do the same for Russia.*\n\nThe point is though, what if Russia doesn't care about that to begin with?  *There is strong precedent for this kind of war.  The Chinese fought the Americans in Korea for the exact same reasons the Russian are invading Ukraine.   The Chinese simply do not care about North Korea's economy, never have.*\n\n*I mean, I get it, most people have absolutely no idea how war works, but they vote and have a say anyway.  Doesn't mean that by voting that they are right.*\n\n&gt;And nato is already bordering with Russia in several countries.\n\nAll happened when Russia was helpless.\n\n*edits above*",

They got rich by \"allowing\" Putin to skim off the top.  They may have even helped him launder some of his wealth through their companies and investments.  But they thrived by his benevolence, not the other way around.  They have no power to influence him in his thinking and he doesn't care one iota that they are now under sanctions and are having their wealth confiscated or assets frozen.  \n\nI'm not convinced that these sanctions against Russian oligarchs being touted by the west are going to be as effective as they are being portrayed.  I suspect it's all a bit performative, aimed at the average person who wants to see some sort of punishment meted out against Putin's enablers.\n\nThe fact is, trade sanctions and restrictions on banking transactions have far more effect against Putin and the Russian economy than going after oligarch yachts and foreign assets.  But it sure makes people feel good to hear a $820M yacht has been \"confiscated\".",

There is no evidence that he is listening to oligarchs or taking their opinions into consideration.  If he was, he would not have invaded given that the west spelled out the details of sanctions in no uncertain terms.  Putin did not care.  We can reasonably conclude this given that his yacht is safe in a Russian harbor while the oligarch were given no warning and were left to their own devices.",

There are US military personel in the Baltics already and Estonia isn't that farther away from Moscow than Ukraine.\n\nI think the biggest reason is that if Ukraine joins the EU or NATO never if the future will Russia be able to integrate these lost territories into itself. Putin himself said it numerous times that he thinks Ukraine is a phantom state, a historical error and that their people are Russian people but under heavy propaganda from Kyiv regime.\n\nPutin is a history buff and I do think that his invasion of Ukraine is an ideological one.\n\nHigh officials from his party already stated that and I'm paraphrasing \"Iraq and Ukraine is just something that great countries do\".\n\nIt has a very 19th century vibe to it. World loves victors. If he was to integrate Ukraine into Russia he would be remembered as Russian tsars. If not the Russian people would despise him. I think that's his mindset.\n\nHe is already incredibly rich (apart from being 69 years old) and he wants to be rembered in history books.",

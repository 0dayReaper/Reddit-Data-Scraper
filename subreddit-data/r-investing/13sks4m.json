            "comment": "Is it pointless (or worse, can it actually *cost* you money?) Yes and no.\n\nYes: if you tax loss harvest you will lower your cost basis, which could result in a larger tax bill in the future if you sell in the future when your capital gains bracket is higher than the 0% it is today. You save no money on capital gains tax in the present but may raise your capital gains taxes in the future. Not great.\n\nNo: Up to $3000 of losses can offset *regular income* after offsetting any capital gains. Even if you're in a 0% long-term capital gains bracket you could be in a 12% federal income tax bracket, plus state taxes, if applicable. Deducting $3000 in losses against your ordinary income could save you hundreds of dollars in the present. It might increase your taxes in the future, but not by much since capital gains rates are lower than ordinary income rates. \n\nSo my advice: it's probably worth realizing up to $3000 in losses if you do not have substantial gains to offset. I would hesitate to do much more than that when your capital gains rate is 0%. If you *do* have substantial unrealized gains right now I would suggest the opposite: you should *tax gain harvest* by selling your long-term winners and swapping them for similar funds. This will act to raise your cost basis, saving you money on taxes in the future without affecting the taxes you owe in the present. Just be sure not to tax gain harvest so much that you move to a different tax bracket.",

The rolled over losses would be netted against gains (unhelpful at 0%) before being netted against ordinary income (helpful). However if you don't have realized capital gains in the future or you move out of the 0% gains bracket the rolled over losses will help you.",

If you think you will make more in the future, and will potentially have a higher cap gains tax rate, then I would think it would make sense to harvest. The losses carry over, and worse case, cou can still apply $3,000 of any excess capital loss to your income each year",

            "comment": "I think it can be advantageous to \"gain\" harvest because carried over loses have to be used the next year. For example if you have $80k in carried over loses, and $80k in long term capital gains, those loses have to be used to offset the gains even if the gains may be taxed at 0% anyway. So it may be better to raise the cost basis of your positions instead of carrying over a loss because you then might be able to better control when you realize less gains. But its very complicated and hard to plan right and ideally you don't have massive loses to begin with.",

Say for example you realize up to $3000 losses on any given year and dont sell any of your winning stocks, you can deduct the $3000 from your regular income to reduce income taxes. This is the real power of tax loss harvesting since people usually have a higher marginal income tax rate than their long term cap gains tax rate.",

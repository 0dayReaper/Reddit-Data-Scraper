In 1995, they started out as a online bookstore competing against the brick and mortar stores like Barnes &amp; Noble, Waldenbooks, Borders, etc.  I can remember them getting sued a few times early on, and people really believed that when the \"big boys\" entered the online arena that Amazon would die.  Obviously, looking back that didn't happen.\n\nDisruptive innovation, macro economics, future decisions by management, and other factors ***are not predictable***.  \n\nHuman emotion/action also plays a role here, and that is certainly ***not predictable***.

This cannot come as a surprise.\n\nTo your example of Amazon. Yes, there may have been legal troubles in 1995. But I didn't know that back then. I became aware of Amazon in 2002 and created an account in 2003 and ordered my first item (a DVD). My thoughts before my first purchase were: Is this safe? I really feared that when I put in my bank account into my profile that it would get hacked (the first time I did that on the internet). But when the package arrived I was totally excited. I would go on and purchase only through Amazon. I still do 20 years later.\n\nDo you see what my point is?\n\nI did not look at Amazon as an investor. But as a consumer. Amazon satisfied a desire that I wasn't even aware of. That getting items delivered to your door (just 2 days later) is very comfortable. I didn't look at the numbers or legal battles of Amazon. But I felt there was a revolution going on. Here in Germany I didn't know Barnes &amp; Nobles, Waldenbooks or Borders. They are not known here. But Amazon was. Suddenly everybody was using it.\n\nSame happens with Tesla. Those cars pop up everywhere now. A colleague has bought a Tesla, a Tesla store was built outside of my town. Musk (like Bezos back then) has become a household name. Many people are talking about Tesla (and can't name any other EV company). And also if you look at the numbers (as a consumer!) they are very impressive: The Tesla Model Y was the most sold car in the world in Q1 2023. Here in Germany the sales numbers have doubled and tripled. I don't care about price-earnings-ratio, scandals of Musk, employee layoffs, Tesla temporarily not being able to satisfy customer demand. I evaluate as a consumer and observer of brands and people behaviour/what they are talking about/what they are buying/what they want.\n\nThat approach would have worked very early on (for me) with Apple, Netflix, Amazon and (not so much) Microsoft.\n\nI do realize my answer is not professional or investor-like in any way.",

However, you are on to something that many investors forget, and this comes from Warren Buffet (I'm paraphrasing):  You should invest in companies you believe in.  If you would not buy the entire company given the opportunity, then you should not buy the stock.\n\nIf you truly believe in the future Tesla then buy it and hold it for 30 years.  If you are right, you will be rich in the end.  However, that carries a lot more risk than buying a small piece of the 500 of the top performing companies, which can be done by purchasing an S&amp;P 500 index fund.",

The Reddit app ate my post twice when I got interrupted...\n\nDoing research on companies whose products and brands with which you're familiar is actually a great place to start! There are a number of \"super investors\" out there who suggest that as the beginning place. Names like Peter Lynch, Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, and Seth Klarman.\n\nKnowing what market is being served and consumer sentiment is certainly important. However, I don't believe an investor can hang their hat on that set of data and call it a day.\n\nIt is really important to know more about the business, itself.  Where are the earnings actually coming from? In the case of Tesla, a couple of years ago earnings were being supported by environmental tax credits.  It might even be correct to say \"propped up\".\n\nIt's important to know how they are financing their growth. If a company is taking on massive amounts of debt that could be a huge problem.\n\nIt's important to know how long a high growth company can continue to grow at that high rate.  The plan and expectations get discussed, hopefully, in the annual report and quarterly calls.  Does it seem reasonable? \n\nWe also can't ignore pricing metrics. No business is worth an infinite amount. If it's selling at a premium, or too high of a premium, we might never see a return on that investment.  Tesla selling at 1,000 times their earnings, which was the case in 2020 or 2021, is a little bit ridiculous and not sustainable.  Up until 3 years ago, I don't believe they were even a profitable company and there were huge questions whether they ever would.\n\nThe other day when I looked their PE ratio was sitting around 63, and their peg was almost 2.2. both of these indicate Tesla may not be a good buy right now.\n\nThe companies that are listed in this overall thread by others are all great examples of \"sure things\" that bit investors in the behind.",

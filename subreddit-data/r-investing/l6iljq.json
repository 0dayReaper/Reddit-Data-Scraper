    "postText": "**Like the title says, this shit is cray cray and we can\u2019t spend all afternoon moderating it.  If you make a post and think it's a quality contribution to the subreddit send a message to modmail and we can approve it.**\n\nThe last two days have seen something like 200 post removals to start with, so with WSB going private and it being 7pm already, which is when we're typically light on mods, I'm just going to step in and stop this nonsense for the time being.\n\nAlso, Reddit has been having server issues all day meaning automod is just fucking up all over the place and not doing it's job.  This also means modmail is on the fritz, so if you don't get a response in a timely manner I apologize but there's not a lot we can do about it - I couldn't even message other mods to warn em I was doing this.  Reddit is a shitshow rn and we can't spend our whole night fixing it unfortunately.  If people weren't spamming the sub with garbage all day we wouldn't be here. \n\nLastly, as a PSA to all of the people who think they've been on WSB for a while and are confused: you haven't been on WSB for a while if this is confusing.  They regularly go private.  It's not the SEC, it's not the FBI, it's not whomever else they say is investigating them.  It's because the mods are tired of dealing with noobs that flood the sub after a media event so they just shut it down.  Hopefully that don't hit ya like a brick in the ol cranium...   \n\nThis is why we can't have nice things.\n\nApologies to all the real ones.\n\nE: Just FYI, if you're messaging modmail about getting a post approved, and your post is about GME, Short squeezes, your thoughts on shorts, or whatever else, then there's a 99.99% chance it's not getting approved unless you have a very in depth analysis or some new and important news item.  Add your thoughts to one of the existing threads.\n\ne2: looks like they're back, I'm still going to keep the post block here for a bit, prior to WSB going down we had probably 40 threads that should have been comments in existing threads.  To be completely honest we have been in need of some sort of overhaul in both moderation and rules for some time - the onslaught of frankly very low effort posts over the last few days has only served to expose just how much we rely on users to do the right thing with regard to posting, this isn't the thread for that, and I'm slammed at work, but it's gotta happen at some point.\n\ne3: y'all, 5 people DMd me and 6 others messaged our modmail asking for access to WSB.  That is NOT how reddit works lol.  I do think this is illustrative of how many people have flocked to this sub and this site without understanding any of it recently.\n\ne4: in the last 60 minutes there were 53 new submissions, of those only 4 were actual posts worth making.  I'm gonna leave the sub locked for a bit till we get a better solution, there's just no way to moderate this onslaught",

The platforms that support us are not making life easy on us.\n\nDiscord banned our server \"for hatespeech\", which is crap. We used bots to block out naughty words and stuff.\n\nWhat they're really saying is that if you get too big you will be deleted at their discretion because there will always be some activity you cannot keep an eye on that can be used to paint you as a bad group.\n\nWhat we're scared about is that the same kind of thing will happen on Reddit. I've been making a scene with the admins because our Reddit bots can't even see posts and reply to them fast enough to do anything.\n\nHow can we risk being responsible for messages we can't even moderate? Hence, we're private right now. Not deleted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: WSB is back. Ruqqus is still live and a backup. Fuck the suits",

There are a lot of 60c and 115c calls that are due on Friday, every single one of these options will be exercised as the stock is well above those marks.  So there will be a huge buy on friday to fill these options driving up the price further.  This will increase the pressure on the shorts position further and increase their likelihood of being margin called by the brokers. Eventually one of the funds is going to say fuck this and get out, then there will be a scramble from the rest of them to get out before it balloons too high. Estimates? No idea as it's a unique situation.  During the vw squeeze porsche set the limit at 1k by telling them \"hey shorts you're fucked, this is what we will sell shares to you for.\" With GME it can go as high as people continue to hold it.  Eventually there will be a sell off as the money is too tempting and that will bring it back down.",

I know it is annoying but this is truly history.  \nNever before has the common man had access to the market the way we do AND it is being used EXACTLY like the hedge fund managers use it  \n\n\nWhy are we the bad guys for exploiting the hedge fund? The hedge fund was going to exploit  Game stop. They were literally counting on the company to fail.  \n\n\nAlso having been a part of WSB for 3 years, they don't do this regularly. How are you trying to sell that they \"regularly\" take down their sub AND discord  \n\n\nStop trying to save your corner of power. Pick a side. Hunker down. They took the risk, it is my reward.

    "postText": "Say I wanted to short SPY. I can either short sell the underlying or short sell a call option. Which is better?\n\nMy retail broker TDA allows me to sell naked call options, earning interest on the premium, without any interest expenses. A Jan 2024 180 call option can be sold for 243.44 using the midpoint. As an aside, since SPY is selling at 420.49 (nice), that excess 0.95 (243.44-420.49) can be interpreted as the cost of leverage. \n\nShort selling SPY would yield me a larger premium (420.49 rather than 243.44), but my broker charges me 10% to borrow the stock. \n\nIf my math is right, short selling the underlying would cost ~8% more than selling the option. While is it\u2019s true that the upside is capped so short selling the call would underperform when the underlying moves below the strike, let\u2019s assume the chance of that happening is negligible. Is there anything I\u2019m missing?",

It's not the same as being short the underlying. \n\nImo - a better solution than deep itm naked calls is a synthetic short or sometimes called a short synthetic future.\n\nAlso - I think that your borrow fee on SPY looks wrong to me. It's a lot higher than I would expect at most US brokers. \n\nWhat investment thesis are you trying to implement? Or is this more of a theorical question about deep itm naked calls?",

                    "comment": "Looking at current prices on Yahoo finance, an ATM synthetic short on SPY for Jan 2024, where you sell at the bid and buy at the ask, yields you a total of $8.69 (420C is trading at 28.30 and 420P at 19.61). SPY is currently trading at $420.49, 49\u00a2 above the strike, so you are effectively \"paid\" $8.20.\n\nHowever, note that if you actually shorted the underlying, you would receive $420.49 in cash, which you could immediately flip into T-bills that expire in Jan '24 for a yield of about 5.4% (annualized). Over 8 months, this works out to a return of 3.57%, or $15.01.\n\nSince you are only getting paid $8.20 instead of $15.01, there is an additional cost to the synthetic short, which works out to the difference, $6.81. Expressed as an annualized percentage figure, it works out to 2.4%.\n\nSo there you have it. If your borrow fee for $SPY is more than 2.4% annualized, it's theoretically better to use a synthetic short.\n\nBut wait, this is assuming you pay the market spread both ways. What if you make the spread instead? Now you are paid $10.02 instead of $8.69. Going through the same calculations, we get an annual borrow fee of 2.0% where you would be indifferent between shorting and synthetic shorting.\n\nAlthough synthetic shorting seems like a winner here, there are still many other relative benefits of shorting the underlying, which have not been accounted for. Specifically: shorting an odd lot (not a multiple of 100 shares), being able to exit out of the trade early without paying a lot of spreads, being able to take a very large position (i.e. liquidity, a big issue for large funds), shorting for a long time period without having to continually roll your trade out, potentially tax reasons? (idk, I'm not an accountant), etc.\n\nNote that all of these calculations are approximate, may have errors, and should not be used as financial advice. Do your own research, folks.",

Glad someone did some of the math.\n\nYour point about placing the short sale proceeds into t-bills to generate yield may be captured by a synthetic short. But I'm not well versed enough in how to calculate and contrast that. \n\nSince a long call has positive rho and a long put has negative rho, doesn't the short call capture the risk free rate. And conversely, there would be a discount to the risk free rate on the long put leg. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm expressing it correctly but my intuition is that rho would price in the yield in a synthetic short. \n\nIs that something that you or anyone else are familiar with calculating?",

If you do a synthetic short on something like SPY, the market maker now has a net long position, which can be easily hedged by shorting SPX index futures. Now that they've essentially \"borrowed money\" from the futures market, they can invest it in treasuries maturing at the same time, in order to cancel out the effects of rate fluctuations.\n\nOf course it matters a lot that the firm in question is a market maker, and not, say, a bank. Banks need to worry about unrealized gains / losses while their bonds are still maturing, so that they don't go all SVB on their depositors.",

Other factors:\n\n* Options will always result in some amount of leverage which could be mitigated by holding cash reserves, but again this is too advanced a concept for most people.\n* For quick plays that do not go to expiration, the bid-ask spread may kill the play altogether.\n*  Options are called on a specific date which as you see, it is a deterrent for most people, granted it is defined risk where as vanilla margin will be called exactly at the worst time once you dip below margin maintenance. So I wouldn't see it as con, but as you see, it scares people.\n\nIf I did a short I would Deep ITM Put LEAPS.",

The expected value of that upside reduces the cost of the time value of money which is built in the option price. In addition to selling the call, you could buy a put with the same strike price to produce a true replica of the short, aka a synthetic short and then the price comparison would be valid.\n\nBut yeah as others have pointed out the main thing is the very high spread that your broker charges you vs the actual cost of borrowing SPY. Because of this you're better using options or maybe futures on that broker.",

Ambitious, but not impossible.\n\nUp until this month I had lost 6k total learning to swing trade options. I made one play over 2 weeks on UPS and turned 1.5k into 10k. Had I realized the stock wasn't selling off before liquidating my position, I could have easily netted another 30k+ when it jumped again from 140 to 160.\n\nI'm only really saying this because it's proven to me that a \"lottery ticket\" style of \"investing\" with low capital is a more effective method of achieving my goal than simply going to a casino and putting it all on black. I have full control over which stock, what timeline, and how much risk I can afford while maximizing leverage.\n\nThe ultimate goal here is to put 90% of my capital into index funds and dividend stocks. I'm simply trying to skip the step of working for 30+ years to reach the capital requirement to live off of the passive income.",

After awhile I figured I could do at least as well as the meager returns they were earning, read the classic One Up On Wall Street, and decided to use my professional knowledge of the computer industry to guide my investments. This has worked incredibly well.\n\nI was an early investor in AAPL, ADBE, AMZN, UI, TWLO, TSLA. And in companies that are gone due to acquisitions: Macromedia, Pixar. Others I rode up and sold off long ago when they lost their luster: IBM, Nokia. Many others.\n\nMy best results have always been from playing the long game buying companies with outstanding and unique offerings, when they were not well-known, hard to explain, unfairly maligned, or otherwise undervalued. They don't come along very often.\n\nInvestment funds can provide a decent return, by soothsaying financials, news, and trends, and you probably won't lose money in a well-managed fund.\n\nHowever, if you have specialized knowledge, you can do incredibly well. It's a hobby that can lead to wealth, but if you're not interested in following the markets, decent is the safe bet.",

Bonds offer very little growth potential in comparison.\n\nI\u2019ve heard different schools of thought on it, ranging from putting your age\u2019s % into bonds, to putting it all into vtsax and letting it ride. Personally, I feel the first is way to adverse to risk, and the second a little too foolhardy, depending on age.\n\nIn all honesty though, if you\u2019re still in your 20s/30s you\u2019re probably best off going almost all of your portfolio into vtsax/vgtsx. The market always goes up in the long run. I personally have only 10% in vgtsx and everything else in vtsax, as vtsax technically covers international stock too",

Whether doing this will work as well over another long period of time is impossible to know. Right now though, I would get rid of most of the TMF if not all of it because rates won't be going much lower so any amount in TMF will lose you money if you held it. I would guess most of your loss so far has been from TMF. In the near term, bonds are not an equity hedge because of how historically low yields are.",

The same 1-2 dozen people charging back day after day, week after week, month after month, going on 2 years now. \n\nYou'd *think* the credit card companies would look into it, but nah. My guess is the process is largely automated and outside of *repeated* high expense charge backs, nobody really looks into such things.",

The type of people who will drop $1000 on something that can be researched for free (or at least a lot cheaper than that) are the kind of people looking for short cuts. They're not the kind to internalize and meditate and learn from other people's experiences.   \n\n\nSeems to me the type of person who goes out and tracks down dozens of sources and digests it all is in a much better position to succeed. Not to mention the fact that paying to get information from one person risks relying on that one person to be honest and correct. Whereas if you're doing the research yourself you're likely to come across a lot of different opinions and then you'll have to figure out which one you think stands up to scrutiny. The problem is that takes quite a bit of effort and critical thinking.",

Maybe the $1000 point is valid that it is overpriced, but paying for something that is targeted towards beginners, communicated clearly and has an end goal in mind has value greater than doing research independently in many cases. It has the potential to unlock your ability to more quickly process the information that you can find on your own. Additionally, the content will be curated so that you don't end up skipping over some key points that you may otherwise not dig into as much as you should have. Both styles have their benefits. This is magnified even moreso when you have 1:1 time with the subject matter expert or instructor. Sometimes the most seemingly simple details can be overlooked in youtube tutorials or online guides. YOu can ask all those tiny questions in 15 min of a paid session and save yourself many hours of struggle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get your point, and most of my programming knowledge has been learned by the google, youtube, trial and error methodologies. But I find if I'm ever in a coursework setting I make progress at 10x the speed because the tiny bug that will get me off track for half a day can be solved in 2 min and I can ask what is the origin.",

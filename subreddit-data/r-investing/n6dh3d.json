    "postText": "I got into the market last year post Covid around May or June. Since then it has been an absolute rollercoaster trying to pick stocks. I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.\n\nEvidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.\n\nPLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.\n\n10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.\n\nSo, I am buying the S&amp;P. It's the boring thing to do, but I will be able to sleep at night and not spend everyday inside staring at a screen. I should have done it much sooner. Rant over.",

We observe all individuals who began to day trade between 2013 and 2015 in the Brazilian equity futures market, the third in terms of volume in the world. We find that 97% of all individuals who persisted for more than 300 days lost money. **Only 1.1% earned more than the Brazilian minimum wage and only 0.5% earned more than the initial salary of a bank teller** \u2014 all with great risk.\n\n\nEdit: MOAR\n\n**Trading Is Hazardous to Your Wealth:The Common Stock Investment Performance of Individual Investors**\n\nhttps://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/Individual_Investor_Performance_Final.pdf\n\n**Abstract:**\n\n&gt;Individual  investors  who  hold  common  stocks  directly  pay  a  tremendous  performance penalty for active trading. Of 66,465 households with accounts at a large discount broker during 1991 to 1996, those that trade most earn an annual return of 11.4  percent,  while  the  market  returns  17.9  percent.  The  average  household earns an annual return of 16.4 percent, tilts its common stock investment toward high-beta, small, value stocks, and turns over 75 percent of its portfolio annually.Overconfidence can explain high trading levels and the resulting poor performance of individual investors. Our central message is that trading is hazardous to your wealth.\n\n\n**Attention Induced Trading and Returns: Evidence from Robinhood Users**\n\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3715077\n\n**Abstract:**\n&gt;We study the influence of financial innovation by fintech brokerages on individual investors\u2019 trading and stock prices. Using data from Robinhood, we find that Robinhood investors engage in more attention-induced trading than other retail investors, and Robinhood outages disproportionately reduce trading in high-attention stocks. The evidence is consistent with Robinhood attracting relatively inexperienced investors. However, we show that it can also be partially driven by the app\u2019s unique features. **Consistent with models of attention-induced trading, intense buying by Robinhood users forecast negative returns. Average 20-day abnormal returns are -4.7% (-19.6%) for the top stocks purchased each day (extreme herding events).**",

They're solving a data warehouse problem no one has been able to solve before. But it's soooo technical that most people don't seem to get it. I've worked in the big data/analytics space for years and tons of companies try to build inhouse versions of Palantir and they all fail. Every single project fails. They're all going to buy Palantir in the next 10 - 20 years and these projects will actually work.\n\nAlso, their revenue is 1/20th the size of Salesforce and yet Palantir's platform in the long term could actually displace a lot of large Salesforce customers. Very few Salesforce customers are really happy with Salesforce. Salesforce's architecture built in the late 90s can't scale to bring in data from lots of systems and it's slow and painful to use. Salesforce is kind of a low code app but it has soooo much legacy problems and apps built on it that they can barely make any changes to it.",

It is a scary place when you don't know what you are doing and losing money.",

Their business model did not evolve, their platform did not evolve beyond some small changes here and there. The new features they're planning now is the first time they actually try to add anything new. It's a not so great company and the stock price reflects that.\n\nPLTR getting \"multi-million contracts\" is like pennies to a company of that size. The stock price was highly overvalued already and when the lockup period ended they rightfully sold a lot of shares back into the market. It's a far-out-future thing and if you want to profit from them you should think longer than a few months. More like a few years at least.\n\nInvesting and actually timing the market/trading are two different things. Trading is a lot of work and if you're not doing it with a lot of money you'll rarely get your time's worth out of it.",

Yes, y expectations were that these companies would continue growth and bring down the pe ratio.\n\nSo why am I scared now? Cause a pe of 500 if INSANE. Its slowly sinking in.

But don't argue that that's what would need to happen for SQ to grow into that pe ratio over years without any increase in stock price.\n\nIt's a lesson that gets learned by new waves of investors every time there is a hyped sector. Despite it happening every few years, it never stops and most novice investors never bother to learn before dumping their $ into the markets. Congrats on using this as a learning event. If beating the stock market over the long run was as easy  as the hordes of new covid-era investors would have had people believe over the last year, everyone would be warren buffett.\n\nAnother lesson worth learning here. Most of the new investors were attributing the insane gains in ARKK to the success of the constituent companies and Cathy Wood's \"genius\".\n\nThe reality is, the wave of new investors with stimmy checks all herded into what waves of new investors almost always herd into: innovative technology. And ARKK was the obvious case for that. Once it started to outperform a little bit, that caused more and more of these new investors to start chasing the performance. And thus a bubble started to form.\n\nIn other words, the success of the fund and the stocks in the ARK indexes were simply a product of a stampede of people all buying the same thing at the same time (IE an influx of liquidity) without any real care about fundamentals. It's all just a supply demand and flows thing, at least over the shorter term. Hence the classic Buffett quote \"over the short term, stock markets are voting machines, but over the long run, they're weighing machines\".",

I do believe that these innovative companies will provide increasingly more value to customers and investors in future. \n\nI totally agree with calling Cathy Wood a genius sentiment though. We should not put people on a pedestal. Same rule applies to politicians, CEOs, hedge fund managers, influencers, etc.\n\nOne thing I am going to add into my analysis going forward is pulse check on myself by challenging me to think about my investment going down 25% for next few years. Is that acceptable? Had I asked myself this question before buying into ARKK, I would have said no and invested less than I did. ARKK is the easiest way to buy into 30 companies all with a pe in triple digits and they are competing with each other in many cases!",

Everyday news and articles come out about stocks that don\u2019t mean jack( unless it\u2019s acquisition/merger/ major announcement). What I learned was to stay focused on fundamental investing- investing in a company based on their financials; read the balance sheet see what is weighing them down or is looking strong YoY. Then look at income statement/Cash Flow.  Looking at charts and trying to trade options is time consuming and a losing battle (of course people can make money and are very skilled but I don\u2019t want to spend so much time and guess where companies are going within a time limit).. But by turning your mind into truly investing rather than trading you can find no stress and results. And guess how easy it is to find this? \u2014&gt; go to their website! \n\nThe most valuable thing you can possibly do is read the companies10-K annual report ( free if you go their investor website- don\u2019t pay for those 10-K sites). They will tell you everything you need to know if you want to invest in them. If they check your boxes( good fundamentals, unique market, growth potential, future earnings potential, etc.) then put your money in and leave it alone. Check your stocks once a month!\n\nAn example is, I have been invested in Ballard Power Systems for 5 years now. I learned about the market they were in, growth potential, contracts and mergers they were getting, and I invested... I didn\u2019t have any growth for years but I believed in what they did and their fundamentals kept getting better and better. Now fast forward to their earnings call this week, and orders and YoY growth is down compared to their record year last year. But if you read their reports and investors presentation they are inking deals with manufacturers and growing the Chinese business tremendously. But. The articles and sellers decided this is a terrible sign of their growth potential and have sold bringing it unbelievably down.\n\nBut guess what it\u2019s a great time to reinvest at lower prices!\n\nThere are many other up and coming companies or older companies with strong balance sheets, good management, and positive outlook. \n\nJust learn to learn to analyze financial statements, read Peter Lynch, put your money into companies you believe in and there is no stress!!!",

They\u2019re signing contracts, they also hadn\u2019t been profitable, there was a lot of locked shares, and the share price is still more than double its ipo a few months back. \n\nAnd you\u2019re right, you would have wasted 8 years holding it. You may have made money on the side selling options against it, but overall, that\u2019s the risk one takes when they\u2019re investing in something that\u2019s easily a competitive field. You\u2019re either going be a top dog and stand up to it or not, and you need the money to back it up. Hey, for all we know, in another 8 years they\u2019ll be calling us the suckers while reaping in the gains for their patience. \n\nI mean it sucks, there are things that\u2019ll never make sense, but it\u2019s eventually, the good will generally right itself. It\u2019ll just be a ride there. Nothing anyone is being told about stocks is because they want you to know, because they care from the bottom of their heart. They want your money, or to protect theirs first and foremost and they have the cash to get the message to you. \n\nLook at  these crap value stocks being valued like covid was gone yesterday, and they\u2019re stronger than they were before. People worried about \u201cvaluation\u201d while something like apple practically just did a cock push up. And yet we\u2019re still in a pandemic. The next this and that. People worried about Tesla\u2019s credits but are okay with airlines surviving on handouts and seen as safe because of it. \n\nWhatever you buy, buy it with conviction. Hold it long or come in with a clear plan and parameters. Screw the noise, trust your eyes and the numbers. They either make sense or they don\u2019t and there is always another move to make.",

I have been doing the same for last so many months, and this is exhausting. I have taken my eye off from the real goal that I need to achieve in life, and have wasted so much time on this crap when I have so little capital to make any meaningful returns. I suppose I was more interested in understanding the game but it was not worth the time I wasted on this shit. \n\nHere are my two cents: Go back to your lives and wait for that mega-crash that happens only once in a blue moon. Have the capital and list of your favourite companies prepared when that event takes place - buy and leave your investment alone for good few years! If you can make money from that event, then may be these last few months were well spent!",

If PLTR is signing these 8 figure deals time and again but dropping, it's because the market was expecting 9 figure deals. It doesnt matter that a company beat expectations if everyone expected that.

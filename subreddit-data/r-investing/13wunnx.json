But by year five, the bond is \"pulled down to par\" back to $100.\n\nMy question is, which idiot will buy a bond for $105, that is GUARANTEED to drop in value to $100?\n\nIf I told you \"Here is a $105 stock. In five years it'll be worth $100\", you would drop that stock so fast, it's half life period in your brokerage would rival that of a muon!",

As to why not buy a new bond, the new one won't pay $5 but something lower to match the same yield, so $100 for a bond and $4.5 per year = he'll get $145 and pay $100 = also $45 profit",

Yield to maturity messes with my head :)\n\nBut this means that if I'm a \"buy and hold\" investor, I can't profit off of interest rates dropping, right? My bond will increase in price...and then just decrease back in price! It's as if the interest rate never fell in the first place...\n\nUnless...I've benefited via opportunity cost?",

Prices adjust to match the new yield basically.\n\n(unless you want to invest in something else, e.g. stock market, then you can sell your bonds at a higher price to cash in the difference in yield and invest it in stock market straight away)\n\nBut before the fact you can profit from that, as you can always short bonds, but it's only assuming only you knew about it.",

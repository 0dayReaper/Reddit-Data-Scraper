    "postText": "I usually buy undervalued tech stocks during their bad times and hold them, but my position sizing has remained the same. I guess that is because I get a little uncomfortable seeing a huge $ amount for a particular position. The positions are usually high conviction, and I am quite risk-averse.  As a result, a significant portion of my portfolio is cash at the moment. So, I wanted to know how others handled this situation. As your portfolio size has increased, do you increase the number of positions or do you increase the size of your positions? Or something else? ",

In case of a downturn, index funds and debt instruments probably won't loose too much value, and if they increase in value, that's not too bad either. I can always sell them when I find a better opportunity. I'll have to do some research, but this may be the way to go. Thanks for your help!",

The winners kept being winners and I was less invested in them if that happened. So what I am now experimenting with is asking myself two questions. \n1. If I had cash, would I buy them or not ? If the answer is yes, I don't sell. If the answer is no, I move onto the second question. \n2. Is there another play that will give me greater returns? If the answer is yes, I sell a given size (my strategy is 10% for every 100% return on capital I have gained i.e. If average cost of say MSFT was 100 and its now 200, I sell 10% of MSFT position) and buy the new position. If the answer is no I don't sell. \nDisclaimer: I don't have too long a track record to tell you whether it works well or not though.",

That position would've been up $6000 today, less than 5 months after I sold it. I learned my lesson - I'm not closing out existing positions unless there's a better option.\n\nMy question here is mostly about the cash I already have in my account. Most of my income goes straight into the investment account, and it has accumulated quite a bit. Around 40% of my account is cash, despite having only closed out one position this year (the Apple one).",

Doesn't matter how much it has run up or is beaten down at the current price.\n\nMy personal strategy is that I aim for between 10-20% in cash. 20% is when I know I might not be able to bolster my cash position in a long while. If I own something that has suddenly gone down and I know it's not driven by fundamental, I spend a maximum of half of this cash to buy it, such that I'm left with 10% cash on my account.",

So you don't always look out for value in stocks if you have sufficient cash on hand, and you reserve a portion of cash to lower your cost basis if they take a beating. Hmm, I like the reserve idea, but I am someone who believes in buying stocks only if they are at a fair valuation. It has helped me avoid losses, so I think it has been a good rule so far. I'm still refining my strategy though, so the impact of such a trading style is something I'll have to look into. Thanks for taking the time to reply though, really appreciate it!",

You are never going to have a large gain or loss on a small position size, so you need to have a strategy which gives you a large position size on winners and keeps losers small.  You essentially need to hope your winners keep going up.  A few will and many will not, but if you can't do this, you are doomed to limiting yourself to small gains.",

In my experience so far, the best strategy with tech stocks is to just buy and hold (or LEAPs if you want to buy and hold with leverage) quality companies. I'm guessing the businesses you're tracking are more cyclical and/or predictable in nature, maybe with limited scope for growth. Buying lows and selling highs would be a very good strategy for such companies.\n\nAlso, what do you do with the cash while you wait for the next dip?\n\nThanks for sharing!",

    "postText": "So, i get: $250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank.\n\nBut (just theoretically).  I see these two banks:\n\nMORGAN STANLEY PVT Bank NY\n\nMorgan Stanley Bank, UT\n\nWould my deposits at these two different (but, related) banks be combined when considering my FDIC limit?\n\nnote: I'm **not** suggesting Morgan Stanley is in trouble... and I get TBTF- and how the FDIC just pays everyone anyway these days - and all that... I'm just asking a general question\n\nI just always wondered when I see these big banks with state-specific listings....",

    "postText": "First of all, I can't wait to be berated in the comments. \n\nI'm gonna be blunt, I have seen a whole lot of dumb shit over the last week.  A lot more than normal.  And compounding all of that is an unprecedented amount of legitimate emotional involvement here.  So let me get started by saying outright that people getting emotionally involved with trading stocks always lose.  Short, long, whatever.  It doesn't matter if you're a 19 year old throwing in your life savings or Bill fucking Ackman not being able to admit he was wrong with Herbalife.  Letting your emotions be a major factor in trading is a fantastic way to lose money. \n\nAnd a whole lot of you are really emotionally involved with this GME, AMC, whatever.\n\nTo the point: I am not making a buy/sell/hold/whatever recommendation.  I have no special insight in to what's happening with GME or whatever else.  What I can tell you is that it is for sure not worth $300.\n\nSo let's dispel one quick thing: this is not David vs Goliath.  It also isn't the little man vs hedge funds or WSB vs big finance.  It might have started out that way, but if you only read one thing [read this](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop): \n\n&gt;Many of the big retail brokerages, including Robinhood, route a lot of their customer orders to Citadel Securities, so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in U.S. stocks. It can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced. You might expect\u2014I certainly expected\u2014to see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week. The stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment, and the posters on WallStreetBets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit $1,000.\n\n&gt;But here\u2019s what Citadel Securities\u2019 retail flow looked like in GameStop this week: 1\n\n&gt;[Graphic here](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i9SnRzR8AM1c/v0/800x-1.png)\n\n\n&gt;Retail investors were net buyers on Monday but net sellers for the rest of the week (through yesterday), and all in all quite balanced: About 49.8% of retail orders (that Citadel Securities saw) were to buy, and 50.2% were to sell.\n\n&gt;What do you make of that? One reading would be: \u201cRetail investors on Reddit might have started the GameStop rally, but they\u2019re not piling into this stock now, and the price action this week is coming from professionals.\u201d Or as one Twitter user put it, \u201cpast the retail ignition, the rocket ship was mostly intra-fast money warfare.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, just to be clear about this, there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade, and retail is a toddler sitting at the world series of poker.  \n\n**Understand that melvin does not need to cover in the way a retail trader needs to cover**.  \nYou, and everyone else, have no idea what Melvin's position looks like, and they can reorganize and exit a position before you ever knew it happened.  You don't know how hedged they are, you don't know what their collateral looks like, and you don't know if they've covered and restructured a short at last week's prices.  You simply don't know.  You only know what's been presented in the news, which is almost certainly bullshit.  \n\nThis thing could come to an end as fast as it started and you won't know what happened for weeks.  You might go take a shit at 1pm today and come back to GME trading at $16 because Ken Griffin got on CNBC and announced they restructured their short at an average price of $200, and were happy to sit on it.  Make no mistake, you'll get kicked in the nuts and have your ball taken away faster than you can comprehend.    \n\n**Emotions**\nThe problem with this whole \"strike back at wall street\" narrative is that lots of you are getting really worked up over this trade.  Losing money sucks, but losing money and feeling like you got shit on by the big guy is going to hurt.  This isn't a moral crusade to them, it's 25 billion dollars.  So if you're out here putting money and emotions on the line that you can't afford to lose there won't be a happy ending. \n\nWant to fight the good fight against wall street? Write your congressman, Tweet AOC or Ted Cruz, get you a fucking picket sign and go wave it around on the streeet.  But dropping money on GME that you need in life ain't gonna change anything except your net worth.\n\nTLDR: \n\n1) know and understand who is playing this game.  And that they have access to tools, leverage, and markets that you do not.  You're playing Le Chiffre at Casino Royale right now, you might think you're James Bond but there's a good chance that you're just the fat dude in the corner. \n\n2) Short squeezes end fast.  As fast as they started.  If you're new to trading then understand buying GME at this price can mean all of your money will evaporate before you had time to make a TikTock about it.\n\n3) Get your emotions out of play here.  This whole nonsense political narrative is only going to cause you to make trading mistakes.  Can't handle that?  then maybe it's not a good idea to sit at this table.  \n\nLastly, if you really just can't get yourself out of the whole \"fight the hedge funds\" nonsense, at least understand that you're spending money that you likely won't get back.  If that's worth it to you then have at it.  But don't fool yourself  in to thinking otherwise.\n\n**E: Completely unrelated**: I hate reddit awards, reddit doesn't need your money.  Go buy like a hundredth of a share of VTI or something.",

For whatever reason we as a society are at the point where Occam's razor no longer exists, and where intellectual curiosity died long ago.  When someone observes something that they didn't like and don't understand their immediate reaction is not to learn about it, it is to jump to conclusions of conspiracy.  This doesn't just play out in finance, it's happening in science and politics as well.  But yeah, whenever you see that sort of blatant conspiracy shit being upvoted it's just a telltale sign that the community in general lacks any real understanding of the subject.",

The other thing many fail to understand is that the hedge fund itself doesn't make money on the investment but on the fees it charges its investors.   They are effectively managing other people's money.  \n\nSo there are is a lot of explaining that needs to be done before the fund goes into a net redemption tailspin, which it may already be in.   And an explanation of \"we're going all in!\", doesn't sit well with many investors. \n\nOnce the investors start pulling from the fund(s), they have to close out more positions to pay the redemptions, leaving them more exposed.  So they need to clean this up very fast as their monthly returns are just getting posted.   Going all in doesn't help",

It's a feature of highly shorted stocks.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp\n&gt; Updated Sep 21, 2019\n\n&gt;Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)\u2014or 125% (25 \u00f7 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.\n\n&gt;In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.",

Still hoping for a paradigm shift, still seeing plenty of reasonable-to-intelligent sounding vloggers, bloggers and Redditors making a case for GME. Not willing to throw in more then I already have (which I am OK, if a little sad) about losing.\n\nThe rational side of me sort of assumes this will flame itself out, but that's exactly what my rational brain would have said before the 2008 crash if a handful of people online started screaming about the impending subprime mortgage crisis months before 'everyone else' seemed aware of it.\n\nThis is addictive, though. The rage, the vulgarity...the perception of having power you probably don't actually have. Must feel quite a bit like what those Q-Anon loonies went through on their descent down the rabbit hole.\n\nI see things like the VIX moving in seeming correlation with GME, Goldman's alleged warning (though I can't see that anywhere but ZH and have no idea what was actually said), a bit of a big tech selling off (so desperate shorts can cover, of course!) and my gut says these brokers messed up...they're still bleeding...still desperate, and the squeeze thesis remains valid if shares remain out of their reach.\n\nEven the Citadel news above; their verbiage seems confusing...graf says retail were net buyers Monday and sellers the rest of the week. But then it references the number of buy orders and sell orders, which if I'm not completely insane with conspiracy right now, seems like a different figure. If buy orders averaged 10 shares per trade and sell orders averaged 3 - which would kind of be in line with what I'm doing myself to lower risk while staying engaged - there might be a 50/50 split in the number of orders but considerably more shares would be staying in retail hands.\n\nTL;DR: This is insane and out of an abundance of caution anyone going all-in who isn't at least considering an exist strategy should be.",

They are also not subject to interest fees. This is allowed in the SHO regulation. This is how long and short volume could (legally) exceed 100% of float, it's a regular occurrence.\n\nHowever this does not explain the outsized Wall Street and Media attention it has received.\n\nUpdate: Looks like almost 2/3 of shorts have covered since last Thursday, this theory that Melvin/co. were competent enough to short via options is bust.

            "comment": "I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that a big portion of the hype around the GME shit is desperation, my dude. Wealth inequality is at its highest since the Victorian era; we live in literally Dickensian times and a hell of a lot of folks are keenly aware that they're not going to escape their meagre lot without a miracle. If you're born with nothing or nearly nothing, it's a 99.99999% sure bet that you'll die with nothing or nearly nothing. The capitalist mantra that your efforts will pay off if you just work hard enough and make the most of opportunities just isn't ringing true for a lot of us, especially in the US and the UK. I know it isn't for me. \n\nI bought a handful of GME for a sum that I figured would be fair a little way down the line if GameStop itself picks up and becomes successful again. It's just brought in a new CEO who has experience with online retail and they're talking about heaps of new ideas to modernise the brand and make it relevant in the current era, e.g., custom PC building in-store. I don't believe it's as doomed as a lot of folks are saying and I don't believe that it's entirely bereft of a future. I think it's going to make a comeback, and that's the metric I used to decide how much I'd be willing to pay for a share as a new investor, a beginner. I'm bullish on GME. \n\n(Incidentally, it's also why I didn't buy any AMC, even though the price point is so much lower. Cinemas and movie theatres have been propped up by the sales of snacks like popcorn for literally a hundred years at this point, and it's only getting worse with the, I don't remember the correct word but like publishers except with movies, with them holding theatres over a barrel and charging ridiculously high prices for blockbusters during opening weeks when the theatres have little choice but to pay if they want to make any money at all. Between that and the rise of Netflix and the like, the cinema or movie theatre, as an industry, is dying, in my opinion. I don't see a future in AMC, or any of my more local cinema companies like Cineworld.) \n\nBut I won't lie to you. I'm desperate. I'm disabled, and I spend fully 25% of the non-refundable hours of my life grappling with the DWP - roughly six months out of every two years battling with assessments, denials of benefit and then the inevitable appeals circus - even though my condition is long-term, very possibly permanent. I live in social housing that I'm terrified could be sold out from under me at any time, and because I'm claiming benefit and the waiting lists for social housing are longer than ever, no private landlord will so much as look at me and I'd be homeless in a heartbeat. I'm trying to write a book, but you don't get paid for that until the work is already done in its entirety (if someone likes it enough to pay you for it!), and even that is a moonshot made out of pure, miserable despair. I'm tired, suffering and afraid, and the billion to one chance that the GME hype does pay off and I manage to scrape some significant profit from it appeals to me in a horrible way that I'm sure you can probably appreciate. I want to *escape.* \n\nI can't be the only one.\n\nAt least in my case, the way I see it, I either get very lucky indeed sometime this month and I can move back to the town where I actually want to live with enough money to buy a modest home for myself that I can't be run out of by someone with more money than me, or, on the other hand, I get a little bit lucky in five years or so and I'll have some extra cash that I can pull out to tide me over the next time my benefits get cut for a few months. Others are probably not as grounded as me, and that's saying a lot, considering *my* position.",

Statements like \"Retail buying drives Silver higher\" are assumed to be just guesses from the author because ground truth data on this isn't something they are going to have access to.\n\nThe most careful statement financial a news outlet could report is \"As discussions on Reddit increasingly mention Silver, prices rise.\"  This statement is just saying that two measurable things have happened around the same time.  Both things are true and independently verifiable, but no causal relationship is being stated.\n\nBut carefully qualified statements are a thing of the past, and it gets way more clicks to just shout bold claims without any factual backing.",

An influencer who once shilled for a Brokerage by claiming splits meant that price will go up and you will definitely make money, is now posting incessantly about GME. \n\nThis trade is not a sure thing. It is a high risk and high reward situation with insitutional players on both sides and the higher the price of GME goes, the higher the chance of new short sellers emerging. \n\nA lot of new investors will be burned by this when they try to get out at the wrong time. I saw someone make a silly populist argument without any facts and just emotional nonsense get upvoted. \n\nWallstreet is not going to change if a couple of hedge funds go bust. Hedge funds shut down all the time. heck, Wallstreet traders have run some funds into shutting down by betting against its positions. \n\nPeople should be careful with this trade and invest only what they are willing to lose. \n\nAdditionally, The Us Vs Hedgefunds narrative is bullshit. it is more akin to battle royale where the longs are killing the shorts but after the shorts are dead you will have to fight each other to get out. Have a good exit plan, A price where you will pull it out and sell. This is not a bad trade, just a risky one that could go wrong for the retail investors who got in late.",

But the way this is being preached by many in wsb as some moral crusade, and that everyone should hold to $10k to force an $800B payout in order to get \"justice\" for the '08 bailout is just eye rolling. Justice is distributing economic prosperity to all Americans, not just Michael Burry and Ryan Cohen.\n\nI think for 99% of us, it's great schadenfreude to watch Melvin burn. But we should all remember that wsb is above all else motivated by euphoric greed at this point, and they're not self-aware enough to acknowledge this. They've bought into their own Robin Hood mythology, and so have many new and/or unsophisticated retail investors, who ultimately are going to get taken for a ride.",

If you have time to check the market every minute, only then you stand a chance. BUT the VW squeeze took days in which a LOT of money could be made.\n\nTLDR Point 3: This is why the phrase with *shiny rocks* is so important. It shows that the best action now is no action.

On Thursday it turned into a full-blown mania, and the media did their part to make it even worse. \n\nI have been investing for more than 10 years and even I got swept up in it last week. I committed way more money than than I'd normally be comfortable with into something I was 100% aware was speculative at the beginning.\n\n&gt; there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade\n\nExactly. And when the institutional longs cash out of their positions retail will be left holding the bag.",

There's a reason they all tend to disagree with each other, and that's the fact that shorts can be kind of nebulous in anything approaching real time. Lots of short action never really sees daylight. Or if it does there's potentially lag ie the position has been unwound or changed by the time it's hitting your radar.  \n\n\nThe fact that there is short interest \\*now\\* makes sense. GME is massively overbought and while we know that there is still a ton of short interest, we don't know what level that new interest came in at. We don't know when they have to cover. The fundamentals that pushed GME early on (such as they were), simple supply &amp; demand + undervalued stock (I need to buy shares to cover my shorts and there aren't enough shares), seem to be dissolving as everyone reevaluates the new situation. People are realizing their gains. The narrative is nice and all but nobody wants to end up bag holding.  \n\n\nCould it all be smoke and mirrors? Of course. Is the continued gating of certain names absurd? Hell yeah-- brokers worth their salt should not have been caught with their pants down on this thing. This morning, RH is still only letting people buy or hold a single share of GME (I think). That's ridiculous.  \n\n\nBut the situation today isn't the same as the situation last Monday. It just isn't. People need to come to terms with the new facts as they emerge and disregard the narrative. The large dollars on both sides of this trade are certainly adapting to the new normal &amp; blood in the water draws sharks. It would behoove the retail side to come to terms with that.

I'm no expert but I don't think that means hedge funds doubled-down haven't covered their old short positions however.  They may well have taken their lumps, covered their old short positions, and taken new ones when the stock was $250+ waiting for the seemingly inevitable drop back to &lt;$100, in order to recoup some of their losses.",

Who can hold out longer, the deepfucking value army or the people who literally control all of the capital? Billionaires or WSB? Some funds may have been caught short, but in the end, the real money is going to ride this out. Whether GME collapses or not, the hedge funds are going to be fine--even if a couple were to fold, it would make no difference. But if it collapses, people with thousands of dollars in the casino are going to hand their money directly to the people the are supposedly punishing. This whole thing makes no fucking sense.",

Here is my concern:\n\nEverybody is treating this like some game where everybody follows the rules, and we're in a mate in two situation.  Rules say they have to cover their short, so they'll cover their short, which means buying 100M shares at whatever people want for them.  \n\nHowever, if everybody was following the rules (including the brokers) then we wouldn't have been short 100M shares in the first place.  \n\nAlso, maybe GME and their brokers can come up with shares out of nowhere to sell, but only the Federal Reserve can come up with cash out of nowhere.  Maybe the hedge funds are supposed to buy 100M shares for $10k/share or whatever, but that costs $1T, and they don't have $1T.  They'd probably struggle to cover $100/share.\n\nSo, if you want an endgame where somebody buys your shares for more than $100 you have to have a theory for where that money actually comes from.  The hedge funds will just declare bankruptcy.  Unless you can pierce the veil you can't get at the billionaires who invested in the fund - they can't lose more than what they put up.  The brokers don't have that kind of money lying around either - not their own money at least.  They play these games with other people's money, which is half the problem.\n\nSo, the only way people are getting hundreds of dollars per share is if there is some kind of government bailout.  Maybe people deserve one but I just don't see it happening.  Even in 08 the government didn't hand out money without strings.  Maybe there will be some form you can fill out to ask to get your original share purchase price back with no return, or maybe with a small loss to teach you a lesson.  Who knows.\n\nYou can't rely on market mechanics to make your money when the mechanics are broken.  The funds and their brokers wrote a check they can't cash, and just waving around that check isn't going to make the cash appear out of nowhere.",

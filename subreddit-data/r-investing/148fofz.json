    "postText": "On July 18 the merger between Activision and Microsoft will fail due to the deadline being July 18 but they are not scheduled for their FTC hearing until August. There is a 3 billion dollar \u201cbreakup fee\u201d in case of the deal failing. My personal opinion is that they will cut a new deal.\n\nIs there any precedent of this happening in the past? \nOr is the breakup fee still required to be paid out if a new deal is struck?",

            "comment": "Sony, and the various watchdogs, are worried that Microsoft will take all of Activision's games, namely call of duty, and make them exclusive to Xbox game pass which would make it absolutely dominant in cloud gaming. \n\nI don't think it's their fault that google, Amazon, and everyone else trying to do cloud gaming has failed.\n\nMicrosoft is addressing these concerns by promising a 10 year period of non-exclusivity. That's why the EU finally agreed. The UK's argument is stuck on cloud gaming but they have no problem with the merger in any other terms.\n\nI'm pretty fairly well invested in atvi so im very much hoping this goes through. I think their arguments are baseless and Sony has a double standard with all their exclusive releases. \n\nAtvi not merging with Microsoft doesn't change the cloud gaming landscape at all. Them merging with Microsoft might finally light a fire under everyone else to start offering a cheap, cloud, service to compete with them.\n\nOn the other hand Microsoft purchased atvi for $95 a share which during covid was a fair price but now that's pretty damn expensive. The stock should be in the 60- 70's at the high end, I think, were it not for this merger.\n\nMicrosoft still stands to gain a lot but it could be argued, maybe, that they wouldn't mind renegotiating.",

If they don't find a judge open to block it ends there, and with those weak motivations it will be difficult maybe.\n* Looking at actual thesis CMA and FTC are using to keep their stance, seems very unlikely to me that they will convince any judge honestly.",

They have degraded game quality for profits and have withheld promised content to customers.  So worst case is no change or Microsoft actually improves things.   Sony has its own exclusive games already as well, but at the same time with the pay to play setup now, Microsoft would lose money not including the PlayStation gamers.",

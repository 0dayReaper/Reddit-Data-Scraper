It seems someone has my account number, but nothing else?\n\nAnyone else get this recently? Do you think this is worth making a new account?\n\nThanks.",

Sometimes the third party connection will trigger an OTP email. \n\nIf you have your TD account connected to a third party, that could be why.",

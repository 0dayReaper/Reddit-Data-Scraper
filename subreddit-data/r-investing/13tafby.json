    "postText": "(Sorry if this post doesn't fit the sub - feel free to point me in the right direction.) I noticed an increasing number of alt investment platforms are offering individual fine art pieces (mostly paintings) or funds with multiple pieces. They often have expected rates of return over 20% for a multi-year term. (Looking at you, Masterworks and Yeildstreet.)\n\nIt seems like the fine art investment trend is tied to the NFT trend which, my assessment, is all about perceived value and speculation. In other words, this is the type of investment where you could go to zero or get stuck holding the bag. However, there seems to be a lot of people dumping money into NFTs and art investments. Do they have money to burn or is this a good diversification tool?\n\nOwning a portion of a Banksey or Warhol sounds like a viable strategy, but I've not heard anyone come out the other side of a fine art investment. Frankly, I've not heard a lot of NFT success stories.\n\nHave any of you dabbed in any of these fine art investment platforms? How did it go for you?",

Art can be bought using a bank wire and the art gets delivered soon after, and the provenance can be passed along and authenticated.

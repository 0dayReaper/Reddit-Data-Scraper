    "postText": "We're grateful (and work hard) to have the means to set our currently 1, but hopefully more children up for life. We started him a 401k at 6mo old (legally, I own a business) and a brokerage. Even if we don't contribute a dime more to the brokerage he should have over 500k by the time he's 10. We obviously won't give it to him at 10.\n\nI grew up pretty lower class. I had a job at 15, worked 40 hour weeks in college to pay tuition while everyone was partying, bought my own car, etc. We never traveled. My parents just didn't have money.\n\nMy husband grew up very upper middle class military family. Parents were both high up and made good money. Saw over 80 countries before going to a paid off college. He's humble, he just doesn't understand what it's like to financially suffer. I am much more for setting up our children than he is due to knowing what it's like to not have money.\n\nI see the world as getting more expensive and our children having a harder time than even we did. I would like to set our children up to not have to grind constantly. But I also feel like I am financially stable because of my childhood. Being poor gave me the motivation to never be poor again.\n\nI'm interested in some 3rd party opinions- are you choosing to put away money for your children? Why or why not?(I'm not talking about like just college paid for, I mean a substantial sum of money).  \n\n\nEDIT: Since im getting a lot of questions on this- he had to have earned income for his 401k NOT his brokerage. We do lifestyle ads for my business- have paid people for this for years. We included him in a lifestyle photo set and paid him what we paid everyone else, so he only has about $650 in his 401k but it allowed us to legally start it.",

Surely, if I fail in teaching them financial literacy, it might happen that they all blow it in a year on hookers and coke, shit happens, it was their money, they have to live with the consequences. But theres a higher chance of them living a more fulfilled and happier life because they had a higher variety of options and less on their mind when it comes to important decissions.\n\nI would include managing a portfolio anyways when teaching my kids about \"finances\", those skills could be the most impactful in their lives.

But you bet your ass I worked my butt off in classes to succeed because I knew that $600 class was coming out of my pocket.   \n\n\nI'm not saying people helped out or well off never succeed either.

That definitely incentivized me to take college seriously and choose a good value program. Along with skills like budgeting, cooking, etc. Having an hourly service job helped emphasize how important it is to be nice to people in those jobs.\n\nYour kid doesn\u2019t have to grow up uncomfortable and without financial support to learn the lessons you learned. You can provide partial financial support, provide money at different milestones, get them a Corolla as a first car instead of an Audi, help them with a down payment for a house, etc.\n\nThose lessons are going to be far more valuable than just handing them an account with half a million in it. But that\u2019s just my opinion.",

We weren\u2019t rich but State school didn\u2019t cost much then and I stayed home.\n\nIn any case, I have never had an issue with responsibility I have just always done what was needed and it was pretty obvious from an early age that I was responsible, it\u2019s just my personality. As a child gets older you may come to see whether they are someone who needs to learn some lessons or not (and there are many ways to teach that that don\u2019t involve withholding money).",

They are aged 5, 2 &amp; 0. But no way I'm going to make it easy for them to get it all or even think we have a lot of wealth.  ideally I want them to grow up thinking we are on a tight budget but they are sort of spoiled already as my wife is a little lax on letting the kids go through some short term pain for long term gain. We send her to private school and she already has a chip on her shoulder as the kids around her are all boussy. I just hate that. Want her to remember where she came from - a third world $hithole (well, me ...not her). \n\nWe already have a \"dad bucks\" concept at home. I'm the central banker and print fancy little paper notes with denominations called \"dad bucks\" and make my 5 year old exchange them for \"surprises\" which are rewards for doing something I want her to do but which they don't like. But she got to have \"dad bucks\" and save it. Harder with the 2 year old as she can't read or get the concept of numbers above 10 so she is on welfare. \n\nAt some point before they are 10, I intend to take them to my native third world country and serve at an orphanage school. I have a cousin who did this and it's helped the kids get a lot of perspective. I intend to take my oldest kid to a star of hope in the city from this year onwards.",

Goal is to have the house paid off by high school graduation, and then house payment can go to college. \n\nIf I'm lucky, around the time they might want to start a business or something, I might be able to seed that too with non-retirement funds.\n\nTheir grandparents  had the same idea, but at this point I don't really need theirs, or by the time they croak I may well be into retirement myself, so that might help seed their retirements.  They have a nice retirement house that I'm eyeballing.  Wouldn't work for a working person, but it'd be decent place to retire too.    Not sure what their retirement accounts actually look like, but I assume they are ok.\n\nEssentially the plan is to not sell real estate, and not touch retirement capital.

The poor have to scrape by, the expression \"its expensive being poor\" has a lot of truth.  But  the rich have to worry about the compounding effects of negative investing. For example with my daughter we listened to and discussed an audiobook by Arthur Vanderbilt about how his family managed to go from the richest family on earth to having nothing in 4 generations.  Essentially a \"there is no amount of money you can't waste\" type lesson.    I worked hard with her to make sure she always understood how everyone in a transaction was getting their margin.  Doing that sort of analysis is key to not getting destroyed as the opposing players get much stronger. Also as kids get richer they need to do much more complex calculations about more obscure risks that the poor do because their money isn't month to month but generation to generation.  What's implausible this month becomes a lot more likely this century.",

A decent education will go a long way. The fact that they will have parents with the means to keep them from bottoming out will go a long way. I think indirect support would probably be better than directly placing assets in their name.\n\nYou see it with lottery winners where they burn through surprising amounts of money relatively quickly and end up with nothing to show for it. I moved to New York City from Phoenix when I was 28. I managed to get quite a lot of credit card debt in a pretty short amount of time. If I had more money at my disposal it would have just evaporated even more quickly. Living through that at least taught me the value of money.\n\nI have a 10 year old who already lives more of a fantasy life than I really want him to. This is largely because my wife and I have a decent income level and we're already in our 50s, so feel we've earned being able to be a little looser with the purse strings at this point. He's just along for the ride really, and it's hard for him to not end up spoiled along the way. Constantly telling him that he's lucky and trying to get him to understand the level of privilege he has only goes so far. I could see him having a hard time learning the value of money if he doesn't get out into the 'real world'. \n\nWhen the time comes, if we're still alive, there's a pretty decent chance he would end up with help on a down payment. And I'm sure he'll have a pretty nice honeymoon! If we're not still alive at that point then he'll probably end up being 'rich' despite my best efforts.\n\nEither way he's an only child with relatively older parents, so he'll probably get a decent chuck of money at some point.

A kid growing up knowing he's already setup to live comfortably will have a higher chance of not becoming as ambitious. \n\nMy grandfather passed 5 years ago. I had no idea he was a multimillionaire. He lived a pretty cheap life and it was all invested. Before he passed, I worked from dishwasher to a general manager in the company in a 14 year period. When he passed and I took half the will, I felt like I did all this hard work for nothing lol I know that's not the case but had I known I'd of gotten life changing money at some point, I'd of just gotten by in my career. The need for more money to afford life drove me to be the best I could. It also showed me how money works and how easily it can be gone if not smart with it. These are things you can really understand through experience. You can tell someone how hard it is to make millions of dollars but if they were born with it, they'll have the well I'm already rich attitude.\n\nNot saying they'll be rich but just using my experience and thoughts I had as an example.\n\nAfter everything was put in my name, I quit lol I don't see the need to deal with stress and shitty people on a daily basis anymore. I still work but only pt and it's something I enjoy doing more. I am however pretty cheap myself. I set myself up with some decent dividend etfs/stocks that support the rest of my income that the pt fun job can't. I've made 2 big purchases since, a house and truck. I honestly have a healthy fear of taking money out of my investments before I reach 55-60.",

My parents taught me to maintain a good work ethic, be financially savvy and responsible, and to work towards long term financial goals. Now my parents are multi millionaires and watching 3 of their 4 kids struggle to make financial progress and do more than just grind without a vacation till we die. \n\nThen to top it all off, they\u2019ve actually given a lot of financial help to the 1/4 sibling who\u2019s already doing super well, cuz that sibling has grandkids. The other 3 of us have all decided to not have kids, and our parents are all sour at us about it. \n\nSo when I finally told them that one of the larger reasons I didn\u2019t want to have kids was because of money, they basically went nuts. \n\nNow I feel like even if they leave us all an inheritance and we\u2019re set for life after that, we will have been able to spend so little time with them and all that, it\u2019s just sad. I wanna be a bigger part of their lives, and think they\u2019d have a much better understanding of where the 3 of us are coming from if they actually spent enough time around our lives. \n\nQuick note to all you older folks reading this: I live somewhere decently affordable, make almost 100k most years, and I still struggle financially, and it\u2019s mainly due to everything being so damned broken in the system. Last year I spent $400/month on health insurance just for me, and still ended up shelling out $4500 out of pocket for a few things, and that was only half of my $9k deductible. Yet just like 10 years ago I had a job that I got insurance through that cost $100/month (only $20/month from me) and it was terrific insurance. \n\nLots of us Gen X, millennials, Gen Z people are basically waiting around till our parents die to have financial stability, and that\u2019s even if our parents have anything to give us. There\u2019s a huge wall of resistance to break out of poverty/working paycheck to paycheck, to having actual stability. Be more empathetic to your kids, and understand that it\u2019s literally so much harder for them to make it in todays world. \n\nAnd yes I believe with the right reforms and changes we can get BACK to where it was.",

My retirement and savings will come first, as it\u2019s important my kids aren\u2019t saddled with the issues that come with a parent unprepared to financially support themselves in old age. I also want them to be financially literate and contribute to their savings themselves when it\u2019s age appropriate to do so, as having skin in the game imparts a sense of ownership and responsibility. \n\nGifting a kid a huge sum of money at 18 with few skills to know what to do with it is a recipe for disaster. I was gifted a relatively small sum of money for college, told to manage it myself and make it last, but never was taught HOW to do that beyond just \u201cwork hard and spend as little as possible\u201d. My mom trusted I was intelligent since I got into a good school, so I could handle it myself. Well, without a fully developed frontal lobe and no education on personal finance specifically, I made really poor choices. It could\u2019ve gone worse in hindsight but it took me well beyond college to really \u201cget it\u201d and educate myself. Let them learn from your mistakes and experiences where you can, whatever they may be.

And they will not know they have this until after they graduate college, except for the 529.  They will also have some inheritance in the future, which I think combined with everything, they should be fine.  Hopefully.  We can only do so much to prepare kids for life.",

I can\u2019t define that, but for me personally I\u2019d love for them to get say 200k to have a huge head start, but not so much that their reality is skewed.  \n\nThat\u2019s different for everyone.

How you raise them has as much or more to do with how they approach things and it sounds like you are in a good place there.  Allowing a kid to get through college is an amazing gift in todays environment.",

I have multiple siblings and we all grew up with paid for sports and private schools, travel, college, accounts with enough for down payments on a house, etc. \n\nNone of us are entitled and have grown up to lead very middle class/ middle upper class lives. We went to state universities and all worked part time through school- even though we\u2019re part of the few who were there not living on loans. We all have average career and don\u2019t buy designer things or fancy cars. What we value is that we do not have the pressure to stay in uncomfortable situations, flexibility to choose a career we\u2019re passionate about and lead a much less stressful life.",

Set them up with custodial checking and savings accounts at young age. \n\nWe would offer to match any of their contributions, and so birthday, Christmas, any cash gifts, money for chores, etc stated flowing in. \n\nWe encouraged them to get jobs at early age (ie soccer ref\u2019ing started at 12, bus\u2019ing tables, pool attendants, movie ushers, life guards\u2014 we\u2019re all high school jobs).  They could see the balances growing. \n\nOnce in college they started landing very well paid internships\u2014 and collected some money by being an RA in the dorms. \n\nWe were fortunate to have the means to keep up the matching. \n\nAlong the way we had them open Brokerage accounts and Roth IRAs- with more education about investing.  \n\nOnce out of college we stopped the matching, and helped them setup and fully fund their company 401Ks and HSAs, as well as their Roth IRAs. \n\nWhile we stopped the dollar for dollar matching, we have been max\u2019ing out the annual gifting to each of them - from each of us (so about $30k/yr each).  The intention is they might use that for a home down payment some day. \n\nWe paid for their college and set them each up with a new car.  They each graduated with no debt, a new car and over $100k in their various accounts. \n\nThey each lived at home for a year or more and completely banked their first years salary. \n\nNo one did this for me or my spouse. But we wanted to give them a super head start, and a thorough understanding of saving/investing- to set themselves up for their own financial independence.  \n\nThey watched us retire early (53) and see how we\u2019ve enjoyed the freedom to travel and do as we please.  None of them have blown any money and they have all landed decent jobs where they can continue to grow their own NW. \n\nWe feel very fortunate to have been in a position to do this.  It did mean we made some sacrifices (ie drove old cars, skipped some home improvements, no flying first class or staying at fancy resorts, etc)- but seeing where they are now, we have no regrets.  \n\nMoney doesn\u2019t buy happiness, but it sure can remove some stress and give you options.",

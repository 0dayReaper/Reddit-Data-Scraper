    "postText": "$Medical Prop \u0000rolling my 8 strike ccs expiring July to 8 strike ccs expiring October tomorrow.  about 40 cents per share in premium spread for those two months while also being \"in\" for q3 div.  the impetus for this decision was (1) I just hit 20K shares, (2) The options expire or are called next month.  I figured I'd rather stay in than get called if anything.  if they went and expired worthless on July 21, I'd of course have had the opportunity to get even more for selling an 8 strike expiring October.  hedging some of that uncertainty away while getting an additional 20,000 * .40 = ~8kish in liquid to play with.\n\nnow SLG late this year ITM ccs allow for a net positive spread even at 12.5 strike.  the spread was like 30 or 40 cents a share last I looked.  so I'll then (1) buy 300 shares SLG for just under 7K (2) Sell 3 12.5 strike ccs probably expiring November (3) use the remaining just over 1K from OG trade plus just over 3K received in option premiums to buy 200 more shares SLG (4) sell 2 more 12.5 strikes (5) use the premium from  SLG step 4 to buy 100 more shares SLG.  if I need to add a hundred or two of outside cash, no big deal (6) sell the last 12.5 strike Cc for a bit over 1K.  gonna use the last 1K for bills.\n\nBy rolling my MPW position forward and taking a bit more time risk at the same strike I'm at now, I'll have generated the liquidity to get 600 shares of SLG that will be hedged such that I won't feel pain until it drops under about 12.21 per share, if it comes to that.\n\n600 shares of SLG hedged in this manner will mean 6*27= 162 per month in additional passive income.",

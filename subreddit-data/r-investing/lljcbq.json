I can only speak for Canada, but I expect Starlink will absolutely pillage the Xlpornet customer base.  \n\n500 sounds like a lot, when your net works all the time.  But like I'm in the city and 70-80 a month is not uncommon.  \n\nThere's even a strong case for government to subsidize the price, because of what a huge economic force it will be.  It's not just, how many people live there.  It's how many people could live there, PLUS, helping business all over the place.  Like crappy internet costs Canadians tons of time in waiting every year.",

Creating the technology needed to establish life on Mars is and always has been the fundamental goal of SpaceX. If being a public company diminishes that likelihood, then we should not do so until Mars is secure. This is something that I am open to reconsidering, but, given my experiences with Tesla and SolarCity, I am hesitant to foist being public on SpaceX, especially given the long term nature of our mission.\n\nSome at SpaceX who have not been through a public company experience may think that being public is desirable. This is not so. Public company stocks, particularly if big step changes in technology are involved, go through extreme volatility, both for reasons of internal execution and for reasons that have nothing to do with anything except the economy. This causes people to be distracted by the manic-depressive nature of the stock instead of creating great products.\nFor those who are under the impression that they are so clever that they can outsmart public market investors and would sell SpaceX stock at the \u201cright time,\u201d let me relieve you of any such notion. If you really are better than most hedge fund managers, then there is no need to worry about the value of your SpaceX stock, as you can just invest in other public company stocks and make billions of dollars in the market.\n\nElon",

There's really no point in hiding much of the visible part of SpaceX, which means, stockholders get to watch Elon blow up a huge expensive rocket every few weeks.  As a private company, Elon is free to blow up as many rockets as he wants to and only has to answer to his own bank account (and a few investors who have the intestinal fortitude to sit back and patiently watch while Elon quite literally sets their money on fire over and over again)\n\nBring on stockholders and a board of directors who Elon has to answer to, rather than the other way around, and you risk what happened to Apple in 1985.  The board will see Starship as a huge waste and focus on the current cash cow that is the Falcon series, missing the bigger picture in the process.",

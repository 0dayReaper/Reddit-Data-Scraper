I understand there is no guarantee and its a complete gamble. At $10 its not a big deal if it goes belly up tomorrow. I just don't want to hear which companies people would consider to look into them. \n\nThanks",

Depending upon the broker, if the equity's value dips below listing limits you may get hit with reorganization fees that exceed the value of your investment.\n\nThere can also be foreign transaction fees if you buy out of the country that also exceeds your investment's value.\n\nMake sure you read through your brokerage's fee details for your account to make sure you don't burn more money than you put in. Before you know it you could owe $100 in fees if you aren't careful.",

You can put in a monthly amount and it will grow tax-advantaged for future education purposes. It will be invested in globally diversified low-cost index funds and send a good message about not gambling with individual stocks.\n\nIf this is a one-time investment then it's not even worth your time or the trouble of opening a brokerage account / actually buying shares. For educational purposes you can just say they are invested in the market and in 20 years give them $40 out of your pocket to mimic \\~7% return.  Unless you plan to periodically contribute then this is the easiest path.",

I decided to take it all away to put it in index funds, most likely S&amp;P 500.\n\nHow is the general feeling after the deal on the US debt, are analysts predicting markets to go up, or to keep going down for the time being ? I am gaging whether now is the right time to buy, or whether I should keep my cash for a little while.",

Anytime is a good time as long as you are looking to put the money away for a few years. Index funds aren\u2019t suited for short term investing.\n\nI\u2019ve worked out that I can invest roughly $150 a month with my income and savings and bills all taken care of. I currently put $75 into index funds and play around with the other $75 with my own research. Two years in, I can assure you the index fund is doing better than my picks lol",

The significant skewness in long-run stock returns helps to explain why poorly diversified active strategies consistently underperform market averages. (US Data). As a result of this significant skewness, you are better off holding the total market (all the losers and winners) than trying to pick stocks to avoid the \u201closers\u201d and risk missing out on the few winners that drive the market.\n\n\nMore Statistics:\n\n90% of active fund managers cannot meet or beat the SP500 over 10 years. (SPIVA, 2020)\n\n63% of individual stocks trail the market at the decade horizon. (Bessembinder, 2017)\n\n4% of US stocks drive the overall positive returns of the entire market. The other 96% have returned on average, T-bill rate (Between 1926- 2016). (Bessembinder, 2017).\n\nFrom 1926 - 2016 Only 43% of stocks in the US Market outperformed T-Bills, while only 31% beat the market\u2019s total return. (Bessembinder, 2017)\n\nBetween 1980 &amp; 2014, of 13,000 US stocks in the Russell 3000, 40% of them suffered at some point a 70% loss and at best recovered to a total loss of 60% (JP Morgan, 2014)\n\nOnly 2% of US Active Managers are able to generate statistically significant portfolio alpha over 10 years.

But that's part of my point tho - In hindsight it was a great buy but an index would automatically under-weight it back then due to its low market cap during that period.

If all we had to do to invest was listen to analyst and they could predict if the stock market was going to go up or down in the short term we would all be millionaires . All we would have to do is well when analyst said the market would go down and buy when they say market goes up.\n\nIts much harder than that and no one know in the short term. In the long term well investments tend to go up.\n\nThere is a saying more money has been lost trying to time the market then has been lost in recessions .",

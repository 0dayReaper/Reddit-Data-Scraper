So it's closer to 600% than 900%. Also if you factor in taxes (it's all wash sales), and commission, you'd be in deep red. Either way this isn't really a \"strategy\" one can use.  \n\n\nEdit2: Also, please note that this is a cherry picked time period. Even in this chart, the time when \"day\" and \"night\" trading are directionally opposite is around 1998-2000. This is what makes the \"omg day-only trading is net loss\" sensationalist title.",

It is impossible for them both to be true. \n\nIt turns out they looked at different time frames. \n\nBuying and holding is just the combination of the two strategies in the OP. It would perform close to their sum. \n\nBuy and hold works fine, but it turns out almost all the gains happen between days. It is only about 4% worse over a few decades, so it probably still wins just from the transaction fees and spreads and so on. There is no way to efficiently buy and sell your portfolio daily.",

If that 4% decline happened during a single intra-day trading session and the other trading sessions were essentially flat, then it would mean 0.04*537%=23% of your original investment in lower returns due to compounding.",

This is roughly a 0.63% expense ratio.\n\nMind you, SPY is not $400 yet, and was nowhere near that price in 1993.  Its bid-ask spread was probably also higher back then.  I wouldn't be surprised if trades executed at open and close also had higher-than-average bid-ask spreads, so my expense ratio estimate is likely an underestimate.",

I was part of the r/wsb influx, and deposited $10.00 into a new dealer/broker, because that's what I can play with. The plan was to be buying speculative stocks with minimal risk with stop loss orders and limit price so my risk to profit ratio is relatively low. This would be until I could afford to put more substantial deposits into ETF's and other sources I've learned from lurking on r/investing. \n\nIf I have had many changes of small gain buys and sells, am I doing more damage than good?\n\nFor reference I have only profitted 3.33 from 6 sells of low profit tickers AMC, CAN, SNDL, and GNW. It has been more of a learning process/fun game to me, but if this day trading like strategy is doing more harm then good, I need to change course.",

If you start with $10, no matter how fabulous your success is, you are likely to owe only pennies for your transactions. In general there is nothing wrong with a lot of buys and sells, although that was not very viable when commissions were still in force.  In practice, your swing trading strategy is wise or unwise depending on your marginal tax rate. If you are relatively low income, it makes little difference. The alternative strategy is to buy and hold for at least a year, because a gain after a year is a long-term capital gain, at lower tax rates. The higher your income, the more important this is.",

That means if you bought in the morning, you would do just as well as if you bought at close, as long as you're not selling your whole portfolio EVERY NIGHT and re-buying it every morning. In other words, someone who buys in the morning and holds gets to enjoy the overnight growth just as much as someone who bought right before close. So, you don't get any advantage by placing orders at the end of the day instead of the beginning.\n\nAlso, while this statistic is surprising, it's not as crazy as it sounds. There are only 6.5 trading hours per business day. Adjusting for holidays, there are 253 trading days per year, so 1644 trading hours. There are 8760 total hours in a year, so only 19% of total time is during trading hours. Thus, we'd expect 80% of the gains would happen outside trading hours anyway. It's surprising that it's \"100%\", but still not as crazy as it sounds at first glance.",

Here's a few more thoughts:\n1) This data is \"cumulative\" return, so the upward slope in recent years must mean there is actually a positive return during daytime trading in recent years. Perhaps that's just because we're in a bull market. A more interesting chart might be a comparison of daytime to nighttime returns on a monthly or yearly basis, rather than cumulative. Because, who cares what the trend was 30 years ago.\n\n2) A lot data comes out outside of market hours (jobs reports, earnings releases, etc), so perhaps those are factors? I feel like that's not enough to explain it though, because plenty of things happen during the daytime as well (government decisions, etc) and one could argue that more things happen during business days than weekends or evenings.\n\n3) I wonder if some of this effect boils down to just timing of order flows, which are large at open and close. For example, if I add to my 401k, I think it gets executed at close (maybe?) the following business day? Maybe the same for mutual funds? I'm grasping at straws, but if anyone is familiar with the buying and selling mechanics &amp; timing of mutual funds, it'd be interesting to hear about it. Perhaps cash inflows and outflows happening at open and/or close tends to give the appearance that gains happened overnight? Just an idea.",

For example market crashes / recessions seem to occur every 7-10 years, how ever that 3 year difference is between of making huge gains or losses, so it's useless to try and predict by just taking a look at the chart.\n\nMoreover the law of supply and demand may remain the same, but underlying factors that affecting them might be random. And because if you are able to make constant profit by just looking at some chart pattern, and this becomes common knowledge, then due to supply and demand, the usefulness of that chart pattern dimisshes.",

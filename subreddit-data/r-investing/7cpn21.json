Just a friendly reminder to ignore the mobs after the recent backslash experienced by EA due to Battlefront 2. Microtransactions are a very profitable business model and will likely continue to be in the future.",

I'm not going to lock or delete this thread despite it reaching /r/all and turning into a show of people angry about evangelizing an investment in a company that they really do not like. The comments that are way off-topic are just going to be allowed, I guess. **Warning to /r/Investing - Here be dragons, there's no more good investing discussion to be had anymore.**\n\nI also have to remind people though that making investments in the stock market is not a strong \"show of support\" for a company, and does not actually directly line their pockets. \n\n**The stock price went upwards because of the choices of consumers, and all investors did was bet that consumers would NOT be mindful of this controversy, and would continue to support the products of EA.** \n\nThis is not a lesson in how the stock market supports companies like EA. This is a lesson in how the stock market reflects how consumers think, and act.",

Why would anyone feel the need to buy half a game for full price when companies like CD Peojekt Red, Nintendo, Geurilla Games, Rockstar, etc... Are putting out good games that will keep you playing for hours? ",

There is probably 10 games infinitely better and cheaper than BF2 on steam right now. But they dont have the marketing budget that EA does. They have to entirely rely on going viral to get their game known. Which can be an issue because most people wont have a history with the world the devs are trying to create. I mean the WHOLE kerfuffle came from the fact that EA locked iconic starwars characters behind a paywall. People were saying \"lock boskk behind a paywall we just want our cool guys first we'll work towards some lesser known characters that maybe have cool buffs.\" Yuhp.",

Claims that they'll die as a company *now* because obviously gamers won't put up for it are hollow -- gamers will continue to throw their money at them just as they have for years.  EA being kinda shitty isn't a new development.\n\nIn terms of ethics, games are not a necessity -- no one is going to starve or be out of a home or basic necessity because someone stuck loot crates into a game.  The worst-case is minor inconvenience, which means that EA simply does not have leverage over their customers.  Its hard to take claims of unethical behavior seriously when its a poster-child of voluntary trade.\n\nGamers have a really, really bad tendency to develop tunnel vision around their hobbies (to a degree that I don't see in other hobbies) and engage in outrage circle-jerks.  Here in the real world, these things don't matter nearly as much as the gaming community think they do. ",

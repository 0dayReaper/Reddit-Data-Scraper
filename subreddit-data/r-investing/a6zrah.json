I guess it\u2019s not just btc related though. \n\nSay in 2017 you realized $3k in short term cap gains and you were in the 25% bracket so you pay $750 in taxes. \n\nNow say in 2018 you realize $3k short term loss on the same position, but this time due to tax rate changes you\u2019re in the 22% bracket. Can you only claim back $660 for your deduction? Or is there any way to recoup the 3% difference from 2017? \n\nNot sure how to google this either",

Unfortunately kept buying more as it went up because I was hyped off my initial gains, including buying some near the top at 19.5k. Just recently finally sold. Put in about 1000 bucks total and took out just over 100. Sure that's small numbers to most people but I only have a few thousand bucks to my name so it hurt. \n\nLuckily I'm only 21 so it's not some life destroying loss to me. Over the past few months I've gotten into real investing with good stocks and some safe ETFs with the help of my dad who is a financial advisor. I still cringe when I think about my crypto phase though. To think what could've been if I put that money into the stock market instead...\n\nEdit- to all the people replying to only my last sentence telling me I wouldn't have made anything anyways, yes, I understand, but I would've lost about 900 dollars less than I did and would own a few more shares of some things I'd like to own. I know it's negligible in the long run but no need to hyperfocus on that last sentence, that wasn't really the point of the comment.",

If you ever lose your number, then you lose all of your money.  And no major 3rd party financial institutions will keep your number, and those new/smaller companies that have kept numbers have sometimes lost numbers or had them stolen in a hack.  \n There is no insurance or guarantees on any of it and in fact many examples of systematic failures.

Every single time people think it's different, and every single time it's proven them wrong. And this time, there wasn't even really a Mt.Gox style event, just some silly hash wars that pushed the market below important support and triggered a ton of stop losses.\n\nThe big difference is that during the last bull run a lot of people were frustrated that they couldn't buy in. Exchanges were overloaded, bitcoin was slow and had high transaction fees, and it was a pain in the arse to buy alt coins. And a lot of banks were banning crypto payments. But a whole lot has changed since then. A whole lot of infrastructure has been built, apps released, development increased all throughout the bear market, many new instituational players setting up shop and many more waiting on proper regulations.\n\nObviously there's no guarantee history will repeat itself, but with all I've seen over the past few months, I think it's premature to think Bitcoin will never reach it's past ATH's, and certainly to call it dead.

The morons that are currently holding onto bitcoins worth less than they paid for them can't get rid of their own losses by buying more. Their money has gone.\n\nAnd you've also got the fact that many of these idiots will sell the first chance they get to break even now. So at any point on any rise there'll be loads shedding their bitcoin. They've been stung already.\n\nPlus there's the obvious point that you will inevitably lose if you lack the nous to sell investments, i.e the trick is buying low and selling high. At any point high or low you can waffle about its current state and what it may or may not do, but if you did nothing when it was high in the past, or low in the past, clearly you won't be helped by the price rising, because you will just wait until it falls again.",

And many of the new people would think \"I've made a tidy profit, I think I'll sell\" too, and all these people cashing out will just cause the price to crash. The thing is, this is likely to happen at any and all price points between whatever bitcoin is worth now and its last high - because there'll be people who bought at, say $10k who see it now at, say $5k and would think \"I'll sell at $10k\" if it starts to rise again. All of which will make it far more difficult to get above $20k compared to the past when, sure, it dropped and rose back up, but at much lower values.\n\nEventually you'll be back where you are now. Except maybe it's a different group of miserable people who are holding bitcoins that have lost them money.\n\nRead the anecdotes in this thread, those arrogant buyers of the past are now telling their friends to stop talking about bitcoin. Many have already sold at a loss. They aren't believers now.",

There's very little interest in it's actual use as a currency, or the issues in using it from day to day, but rather, there is only concern for it as a investment vehicle to insane gains.",

Very few businesses accepted bitcoin, and only a small percentage of the traffic was actual transactions, so the majority of the \"value\" was created by investors.\n\nIf that's not the definition of a bubble, then I don't know _what_ is.\n\nI told everyone I knew that it was very likely to pop, but either they didn't listen or they weren't involved in trading it anyway so they didn't particularly care. However, since it was driven almost entirely by hype, the bubble would continue until enough people decided to hop off the train. I didn't see any reliable long-term options to short (1-2 years) that wouldn't leave me homeless if the hype train continued, so I just stayed out.\n\nLike you, I'm bullish on the technology, I'm just not bullish on the value of bitcoin right now because I don't see any support besides hype.",

If you've got a sub that exists to discuss bitcoin and are constantly flooded with people who just want to shit on bitcoin then you've gotta do something.  The unfortunate side effect is when you go overboard you promote a lot of groupthink.\n\nHere we sometimes need to take steps in the opposite direction.  For instance last year if someone was aggressively pushing crypto and never discussed investing they'd often get a timeout.  We want to promote diverse opinions but evangelization isn't appropriate here.  I kinda get why some mod teams on more topic specific subs ban people indiscriminately.  Unfortunately the internet is full of people who just want to go to those subs and argue with everyone.  ",

The way I explain it is as an scarce asset with a multitude of future potential uses, any one of which could justify a higher real value than today's price, but all of which will take time and effort for developers and companies to build support for.\n\nIt's going to continue going through bubble-crash cycles for years as it has in years past because, as a revolutionary technology, there's no stable path to go from $ low value to $ high value without painful speculative spike/crash cycles.\n\nGenerally those who understand what the technology can do and how it actually works are in compete agreement- there's no way it isn't going to revolutionize at least some industries, including finance, in the future.",

Take a look at bitcoinobituaries. Bitcoin has \"died\" over 300 times, yet here we are today. Fact of the matter is that Bitcoin is not dead, it will probably never die, and although last year was \"a bubble\", that doesn't make Bitcoin *itself* a bubble. Bitcoin *grows* in bubbles. Bitcoin has a wide variety of use cases for a wide variety of people. I can promise you it won't end here.",

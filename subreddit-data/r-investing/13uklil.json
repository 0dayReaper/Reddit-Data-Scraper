As we now reach a bipartisan deal, is it safe to all in T-bills now, or should I wait for congress to pass the debt ceiling increment plan?\n\nI am worried that the debt ceiling increment plan somehow does not get through due to any reason, and I lose all my principals.",

Does anyone think that the US is going to say they are not going to pay them and they are all now worthless over a political squabble? That is unthinkable. It would result in the collapse of the world's financial systems.\n\nFailure to pay principal and interest on the due date is a default. It does not mean that they will never be paid. The most likely scenario would be a temporary delay in payment if the debt limit is not raised in time.\n\nThe \"X\" date is not a hard and fast date. It is an estimate. There are things the government can do to extend the date - probably up to at least August.\n\nConsider a corollary. If you miss a timely payment on your car loan. That does not make your loan worthless to the lender. You could catch up and continue making payments and the car still has some value.\n\nI'm buying lots of 4 week T-Bills while the rates are jacked up because of the uncertainty.",

That means interest rates may rise, and bonds you bought before that time may fall in value. Perhaps the market has already accounted for this chain of events in current prices, but I would wait a bit to see what the market does.",

But Warren and Charlie will famously take questions from any shareholder selected at random at the annual shareholders meetings. The Q&amp;A session lasts a few hours.\n\nAdditional questions are also curated by Becky Quick who wil ask the questions submitted by any retail investors who can't make the meeting in person.",

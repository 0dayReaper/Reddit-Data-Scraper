Most people cannot devote time to do all this.\n\nI have posted this example many times before but lets say you have the aptitude for investing and picking great companies , and lets say this gives you an edge and you can beat some metric like the S&amp;P500 by 3% a year by stock picking(Again this is a big IF most people would probably not be able to do this but lets for argument sake say you can)\n\nHowever to do this you need to devote a lot of time, reading companies filings , studying the industry , pouring over financial statements or doing DCF to determine what companies are under priced....\n\nWell unless you have a large amount of money to invest this may not be worth it. If you have 100k you could\n\nA. Invest in an index fund that takes almost zero effort and get returns of 7-9%(over long periods)\n\nB. Spend hours and hours researching companies/industries , doing all the work needed by pouring over companies filings, reading financial statements doing DCF and get returns of 10-12%\n\nIn a simplified example if you have 100k you could invest in an index fund and make 9k doing nothing or opt for B and make 12k.  The alpha you generate is 3k....and if this took you hundreds of hours its really not worth it. You would be better off just investing in an index fund and get a job that pays you to work those 500 hours and invest extra into index funds\n\nNow it may be worth it if you have 10 million , now putting hundreds of hours into research will net you an extra 300k what may be worth it . However that is a big IF, and not everyone can outperform the market even if they spend hundreds of hours doing research . This is why index investing can be so powerful",

            "comment": "1. Look for an industry or company that strikes your interest. Look at how much they make, how much they spend/debt, what that debt is for, the business's future outlook. You should look at more than this depending on the industry, basically read the Co's 10K, 8K's.\n2. Sell when you think you made an appropriate amount of profit based on your assessment of the company's value. Near and long term milestones should be looked at. Buy when you think a drop in value is unwarranted, or that growth is likely.\n3. A couple hours a week/month for each business. There's a lot more time spent in initial DD than while holding a stock. An occasional deep dive again on a business is good if you find yourself forgetting certain facts.\n4. Depends on the industry. Cyclical industries like automotive, you should keep up to date on whether a recession is coming. For smaller scale companies/startups, a market downturn might lead to a harder time raising cash or short term stock depreciation, but the fact that it is looking to grow and not maintain a hold on an industry isolates it more from recessions IMO.",

            "comment": "1. I buy value - when the price is attractive based on current value/profitability of the company, strength of the company, and general sense of future growth/increase in profitability/increase in dividends. I tend to buy what I come across in everyday life or professionally that looks good after I research it. \n2. Honestly, I have trouble selling. If its declining and I don't think its temporary I'll dump it. I don't tend to sell my winners or steady stocks. Once I buy I'll DRIP in to buy more. I'll also track my existing positions and add to them when they look attractive pricewise (e.g., during the COVID drop). \n3. I check my investments quarterly. I skim the news on the stock tracker on my phone by investment every week or two. \n4. Individual stocks only make up about 12% of my portfolio. For the couple of positions that have grown a bit too large for my comfort, I'll use those for my charitable donations (i.e., donating shares of stock) to reduce my holdings. I do my big rebalancing by adjusting contribution amounts to the various index funds that I automatically invest in.   \n\nSome general thoughts - a). Don't try to invest in more than maybe 10-12 individual stocks. Even with the buy and hold strategy I use, more than that is hard to keep up with. b). Don't short term trade. If you're working 60-70 hours you don't need to stress or hassle of trying to time trades. Look for value or growth at a good price, buy it, plan to hold it for a long time, and check on it a few times a year.\n\nGood luck!",

That's one of my buying criteria.  \"What's this going to look like in 5 years\"\n\nPeople talk about \"day trading\"   I do month, quarter or even year trading.\n\nFor macro stuff, if everything is up, everyone's making money, I sell and move to safety.    If everything is down, I buy.       Right now, things are on an upswing, so it is looking like sell.   But, there's also a recession predicted, so maybe buy, or wait for things to come down in the recession.  Things are weird now, I'm about half and half because I can't tell which way things will go.\n\n\nI like companies that I deal with at work or have a large local presence as I might follow their news naturally, or watch them closer than others might in the course of my normal news consumption.",

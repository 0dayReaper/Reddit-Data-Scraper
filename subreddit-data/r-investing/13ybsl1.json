In a low interest environment with theoneu printer going strong people can survive as \"influencers\" or by doing small jobs like Uber and similar. It's easy and cheap to \"be your own boss\" and run a company...especially since your expenses are low.\n\n\n\nWhen interest rates go up people spend less. Less spending hits all gig jobs hard, simultaneously all prices has gone up and interest is through the roof meaning it's expensive to live...and making cents to the dollar at Uber or even as a plumber doesn't cut it. You'll do anything for *security* and a *guaranteed salary* even if it's not as promising/fun as being your own boss (babe\u2122)",

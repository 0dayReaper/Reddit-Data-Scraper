    "postText": "You people sound ridiculous. We've had a bull market for 11 years and now after a bear market for 1 week, you're already asking \"are we there yet?\" when it comes to the bottom.\n\nThis is not a dip. This is not a dream. This is the new reality. The market going down is the new normal.\n\nAnd it will be this way for several months at least.\n\nThe large distance that the markets have quickly fallen speaks not to how close we may currently be to a bottom but how far we may ultimately end up falling.",

Even in 2009-2010 people were preaching that the worst has yet to happen and that hyperinflation was coming etc.  I had a couple friends that followed Peter Schiff religiously, one took out large loans to buy silver and gold around 2010-2011 to protect themselves from the impending hyperinflation.\n\nI don't have a crystal ball, my focus is just keeping my job during this recession rather than checking my balance sheet every day.   I'm glad I didn't panic sell in late 2008.  Personally, the long term unemployment was much more devastating than the market crash.   I took a hit in the past few months for sure, but I'll be alright.  I have a good paying but extremely demanding job with good job security that hasn't eased up even with the current global situation.  I simply don't have the time to try to time the market.",

It's not like a completely random chance of any outcome. We work with the data that we have and that's it. \n\nAnd for now, the biggest predictive driver of the economy has been the fallout of the virus. Markets are reacting to 1) the virus, and 2) the reaction to the virus. Track those things two very closely, and it gives you a pretty good picture of what's to come from investors.",

Single day price declines are bigger than recent market crashes; maybe this implies that the market can more quickly correct valuations, and therefore start the climb back up sooner?\n\nTo be honest, I can only see things getting worse for the time being. Less people are going to be working, nobody will be spending money, and governments are going to have to take on tremendous debt just to keep people fed. But maybe that's baked into the price.

They have products that are easiest to use as part of remote work. They have factories in Asia which actually seems to have the best handle on this outbreak despite being the epicenter. And by virtue of being tech companies they should be fairly well skilled in remote work and flexible work capabilities. They also have the most cash on hand to deploy to buy out others at low prices, buy up their own shares, or pick up good employees when no one else is hiring. \n\nHonestly I don\u2019t know how someone could think tech would be impacted so heavily. Out of MSFT AMZN GOOGL and AAPL I would say AAPL will be most heavily affected, but even then they are having to limit online bulk orders not because of lack of supply, but actually because of excess demand due to potential price gouging as well as remote schooling iPads. However, I\u2019m fine if everyone wants to sell shares and I will happily buy at much cheaper prices even though nothing has changed in their space long term.",

Due to the math involved, they lose more each time they move against you (beta slippage), limiting their return. In up-and-down markets, you'll make less than you think. The best practice is holding intraday only. (Unless, of course, the price moves are dramatically in your favor.)\n\nIf you want to bet on a downward move over weeks, buy put options when IV is down (like it's been yesterday) and the price is rallying high. Expiry a month out or more. Moves against you will hurt, but moves in your favor will gain you even more. (edit: This is a higher-risk, higher-return play than 3x leveraged ETFs, to be clear. Your max loss is the amount you pay for the option.)",

The more people expect an option to be profitable, the more they buy it, driving the price up. IV is the *implied speed* at which the price could move, calculated from the prices that people are buying the option at.\n\nA good broker will typically show the IVs of options next to their prices. You may have to look around your app/site for it. In good times IVs in the 20%-30% range are good to buy, but in these times, everything is 70% or higher. Some volatile options are at multiple-100% IV (e.g. airline and hotels at 250-300%).\n\nThe higher, the riskier it is to buy, because if the stock doesn't keep moving really hard (mostly in one direction), IVs will fall as people realise it isn't going to move so much. That's where you start getting into options strategies that insulate you from IV changes (e.g. spreads, in which you both sell and buy IV). Beyond the scope of this quick explanation.",

            "comment": "The market hates uncertainty.\n\nBut the market is also irrational, and stock quotes are just the price tag.\n\nSo, we might be much deeper than what the real value of most companies are.\n\nHowever, the real value of some of these companies could disappear over night. The crisis is about to hit the US, and it's not yet slowing down in Europe. \n\nMarginal value of companies is probably lower than they should be. Real world value probably hasn't changed, but could change dramatically. \n\nLet's take TSLA for example. Last time I checked, the book value of the company was $30 per stock. It was trading at $200. Now, it has gone up to the skies and came back down again. I very much doubt the actual value of the company has shifted, at all, during that time.\n\nNow, let's compare that to the economy as a whole. We've operated for a long time in a world where stock prices do not match to the economy. Some trends say it has been quite ridiculous in the US. So, the stock market could probably already go to half its value, and it might not be terribly under of what the economy itself would value those companies at. Still, the actual value of the economy might not have moved. Maybe in the short term, the economy has grown due to panic and increased spending.\n\nHowever, this only relates to price. Price is important, but I think the third factor in buying a stock is always most important. That factor is sustainability. It extrapolates during a crisis, but you can measure it and track it out of crisis as well. \n\nIf you honestly looked at the trends of airline companies and air traffic in general, or how some of these airline companies have wasted billions in either stock repurchases, or doomed projects that didn't do anything, but drain their wallets. Even before the crisis, be honest, did you think they would be sustainable?\n\nNow, back to the economy, and the US in general. The US has been in a trade war over multiple issues and with many of its largest partners. The US has cut taxes while income disparity has been growing. The US maintains a high productivity and low unemployment, but the workers do not earn a livable wage. While the stock market has soared, there has been worsening living conditions and decreasing wealth for a record amount of people. Not to mention the rate cutting, increasing both governmental and household debt levels.\n\nAsk yourself, before the crisis, did you really think that was sustainable? \n\nMy view on this is that it will showcase the mistakes made before COVID-19 ever evolved to be contagious. Now, we will only really see what level of damage that does to the economy and humankind eventually, but when you look at the magnitude and multitude of idiotic decisions, your outlook shouldn't be very hopeful. \n\nHowever, for a smart investor, this doesn't change anything. First you invest in yourself. So spend this time prioritizing your health, saving money, educating, etc. Secondly you create a base to work off from. Figure out how to keep an income if you can't leave your house for 14 days. Figure out if you still need to do some yard work or buy supplies.\n\nThirdly, and lastly, you buy and you hold. If you keep in mind the three factors, which are price to book value, price to earning, and sustainability, this is probably the best time to buy. You should always be doing much more research than buying. This is the perfect time to do the research. \n\nLet's end this with a thought exercise. Assume everything goes to shit. It's worse then WW2. Economy basically crashes. Which companies will still be operational? Which companies are essential? Which companies could not be happier with a complete economic destruction that COVID-19 will bring? \n\nPersonally, I think just due to drop in oil price, most logistics companies saw their profit margins increase vastly. I'm certain most places will actually have more economical activity in terms of spending and consuming, if we just consider food, and other useful stuff. Now, there might be massive differences between logistics sectors and companies, but that's just my thoughts.\n\nInvest in yourself, build a base, and buy and hold. \nStay safe and stay inside.",

Several corporates arranged multi-billion term loans to bridge the liquidity gap. And the banks this week brought an impressive number of bond deals to bolster capital ahead of uncertainty ahead. An end to the merry-go-round of M&amp;A for a few months isn\u2019t going to push JPMorgan into a Lehman and implying that there\u2019s a relationship there worth extrapolating is a bit silly, in my opinion.  \n\nPE deals are stalling because the levered loan and HY credit markets are frozen. Banks, even in good times, try to provide only bridge financing to LBOs, so the primary credit market being shut means the banks don\u2019t want to underwrite those loans and potentially keep the onerous capital charges for years. \n\nYour concern about corporate liquidity is better placed than your talk on the banks, but keep in mind that we had a multi-month record for the amount of new bond deals this week. My concern centred around the names with hair that can\u2019t come to market and don\u2019t have assets to borrow against\u2014but even American Airlines got a bank loan this week, signifying the system hasn\u2019t dried up completely just yet.

I think it gets updated every day.\n\nhttps://www.yardeni.com/pub/sp500corrbeartables.pdf",

People are already trying to predict the recovery and start buying at bargain prices as things seem the most dire, just like the market crashed 30% before it was really affecting the us here in America.  \n\nYou may already be tired of the question but it's going to be a relevant question until the market starts going back up.  I think the expectation is that the market will hit the bottom intrayear, but if treatment is developed before vaccines can be developed, the fear of exposure will quickly drop off as people will need to get back to work.  Most of the unemployment will quickly disappear as businesses reopen and the market will spike up after falling so far.  If it gets too bad the government will have to inflate our way out of it which will weaken the dollar and prop up stock prices on its own.",

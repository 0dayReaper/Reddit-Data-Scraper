    "postText": "*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch.*\n\nThere are numerous posts on this sub and others diving into the technical guts behind some of the recent moves behind GME, so I will keep it high level for everyone scratching their heads wondering what's going on.\n\nThere has been much talk on CNBC and in other financial media calling what's happening in GME a distortion of the market and an unjustifiable departure from the fundamentals. That is undeniably true. That being said, the distortion is not what's playing out now, but rather what happened about 1.5 years ago when short interest in GME first began to approach (and later exceed) 100% of the available float.\n\nShort selling is usually a tool that aids in price discovery, but like most market mechanisms, at the extremes things get more complicated.\n\nShort sellers, having borrowed shares, are guaranteed (indeed obligated) future buyers of the stock. They put themselves in that position on the thesis that there are reasons to expect the stock price to go down, such that when they buy the shares back they can return what they borrowed at a lower price and pocket the difference. As such, as short interest grows, there is a short term downard push on the price (the initial sale of the borrowed shares), but also future upside pull on the stock price as a natural result, kind of like gravity, but pulling the price upward. Normally that pressure is so slight and subtle that short interest in and of itself should not be a mover of the stock price.\n\nThat being said, a common rule of thumb is that you should start to concern yourself with that pressure when short interest crosses the threshold of between 20% and 25% of the effective float (shares actually available to trade). At that level and above, the pressure starts to become noticeable, kind of like the moon causing currents and tides.\n\nGME short interest was recently **140%** of the float. In recent days, short interest has actually continued to accumulate (I'll explain why later).\n\nThere is, in effect, a critical mass of short interest hanging over GME's price exerting not subtle pull, but face-ripping force like the gravity of a black hole. A short singularity, if you will.\n\nPrevious short squeeze case studies such as VW or KBIO were all about someone engineering a way for effective float to evaporate, suddenly leaving what was previously a relatively reasonable aggregate short interest position in a world of hurt. This is the first time where we're seeing a situation play out where it wasn't someone engineering a shrinkage of effective float, but large market-moving players simply blowing up the short interest to the point where it simply overtook effective float by a large margin. Why would they do that? Because they expected GME to declare bankruptcy in the very near term so that returning borrowed shares costs $0, as the shares are worthless at that point. Also, an arguably intentional side-effect of this massive artificial sell-side pressure on the stock is that it becomes more difficult for GME to obtain any kind of financing to avoid bankruptcy, making it, in theory, a self-fulfilling prophecy. GME, however, did not go bankrupt for reasons that are well explained by other posters.\n\nIn order to close their positions and limit their exposure (which remains theoretically infinite otherwise), short interest holders need to collectively buy back more shares than are available on the market, and especially since GME is no longer at risk of imminent bankruptcy, that buying action would push the price into a parabolic upward move, likely forcing brokers to liquidate short interest-holding accounts across the board on the way to buy shares at any price to cover their otherwise infinite liability exposure (and that forced covering will push the price further upward into a feedback loop--like crossing the event horizon of the black hole in our analogy).\n\nSo what is happening now, and where do we go from here?\n\nRight now, short-side interests are desperately trying to drive the price down. There has been an across-the-board media blitz to try to scare investors away from GME. But there is really only one way to drive price down directly, and that is selling. In fact, given that most of the large holders of GME long positions are simply sitting on their shares, it means selling. even. more. shares. short.\n\nEven as price has been grinding upward, and liquidity has been evaporating, short sellers, who have lost billions mark-to-market currently (my guess is on the order of $10bn by the end of trading today), can only keep selling, piling on even more exposure and losses, staving off oblivion hour by hour, minute by minute.\n\nGME might also decide to issue more shares to recapitalize its business on the back of the elevated share price, but it is unlikely they could issue enough shares to change the overall trajectory of the stock at this point (especially not given their fiduciary responsibility to current stock holders). It might, however, run the clock out a little while longer.\n\nAt this point it looks like there will either be some type of external market intervention by regulators (though I can't see any reason for them to step in myself), or we will soon see what happens when short positions representing \\~$8bn in current mark-to-market liability goes parabolic.\n\n\\*edited for grammar\\*\n\n*edit*\nPlease keep discussion to helping everyone understand what\u2019s happening, which is the point of this post, not giving advice or telling people to take actions!\n\n*edit*\nDidn't realize people were still reading this.

At $150?\n\nThe answer is: it literally does not matter.  Every goddamn short is underwater right now.  In other subs, I compared this to the Red Wedding (Spoilers? If you know, you know).  The doors are blocked.  There is no escape except to trigger the mother of all short squeezes now.  All their positions are screwed and they are out of ammo.\n\nPeople need to understand that entire hedge funds are RUINED right now.  Completely.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\n**EDIT**: I just want to clarify a bit.  So, the only strategy the shorts had was to buy time.  When you're short, your losses are theoretically infinite (you have to pay back a more expensive share than you borrowed and sold), but they can typically be hedged by continuing to short on the way up.\n\nI short sell a stock at 20 dollars.  It goes to 30.  No matter, I'll just short at 30, too!  It goes to 40.  Who cares?  I'll just short at 40!  It goes to 50.  Why wouldn't I short at 50 if I were prepared to short at 20?  You get the idea.\n\nAll along the way, you might be rolling out your 20 shorts (which carry a lot of liability), covering those positions to short at higher prices.  Hedge funds have enough ammo to do this a long time.  If they could have done this for long enough, maybe retail traders would have gotten bored and eventually cashed out and walked away.  That was the short sellers' escape hatch.\n\nThere was some concern that maybe the hedge funds had traded out all their really crappy GME shorts for better ones, shorting when the price spiked from time to time.  While we knew that the short interest (how many short sold shares relative to total shares in the company) was insanely high, we did not know where all those were shorted.  That was a bit of a problem for us.  Just because the shorts are oversold, it doesn't necessarily mean they have a catastrophic problem. If they were primarily shorted at favorable levels, they might be able to just wait us out.\n\nNow, it doesn't matter.  We know that all the short sellers are underwater.  That's what happens when a stock hits new highs every day.  You are always in a worse position than the day before.  The stock is at an all-time high.  **There can be no shorts who are holding favorable short positions right now**.  They are all screwed, it's just a matter of degree.",

A bankruptcy court will eventually figure it out and pay back what debts it can from the fund's remaining assets, but in the meantime the shorts won't be covered.\n\nThis doesn't really happen in the short term though. Prime brokers that let funds trade on margin will forcibly liquidate the fund's positions on their behalf (like Robinhood will do to you or me if we don't cover a margin call) if it comes down to it. That's why Melvin had to beg for $2B from other funds yesterday, their prime broker was demanding more collateral because of their losses, and Melvin didn't want their shorts to be unwound at market prices, so they had to find cash fast.\u201d\n\nEdit: fixed username",

It\u2019s the lender\u2019s buffer against getting dragged into a net negative position. So when it\u2019s dangerously low you get a phone call from your broker, aka a margin call, to add more margin ASAP or else be liquidated.",

If your account value starts to go too low, they call and say \"Add more to your account as a buffer to cover a potential loss, or else we're limiting our exposure by closing your position at the current loss.\" (buying back the option or stock at what is now a large loss) Prices fluctuate, so some people would rather ride it out than lock in losses, but your broker isn't taking that risk. Margin is just a credit line from your broker, basically. Sometimes you can make purchases with that credit, sometimes it's just there for temporary losses.",

So really what they want to do is get as much liquidity in and hope they can get a bust before they are screwed.\n\nThat is quite unlikely, and there aren't a lot of scenarios in which the shorts win. The question then is who of the longs get to sell. Not everyone gets to sell at $1000 (theoretically they do, but in practice we don't know, because it may wreck not only the fund but the broker as well), and if you're too late, you'll be holding GME stock back at $10 or $20. This creates a difficult process because the fear may cause people to sell earlier.",

Don't marry a trade.  Don't let one bad trade blow up your whole account.  Set risk, and stick to it.\n\nI mean how in the world do you enter the short side of a stock at $4 and STILL be holding it at $250?  And not only still holding it, but holding even more of it?\n\nThese hedge funds are so used to just being able to buy their way out of any position that they don't even comprehend the idea of losing on a trade.  They could have covered at $20 or $40 and lost a good chunk of change, but gone on to fight another day.   They had like 15 different opportunities to get out in the $60's.\n\nUltimately if they go under it will be due only to their hubris, and they will deserve it.  Because unlike some average joe that downloads Robinhood and starts playing around with it, they knew better.",

Is this when the short squeeze starts to happen or does that happen over a period of time after expiry (going into next week or weeks)? I assume people who want to make money with options will have exercised/exercise by then. Will that event trigger the squeeze over a period of time going into the next set of expiration dates (like Feb/Mar/onwards)? Will this keep going like a cycle of some sort for a while after?\n\nSorry if this seems like a dumb series of questions. I'm just trying to understand how the squeeze actually plays out. I know people mention VW and I've heard it took that event 2 days to reach the peak. I know we won't know exactly how this will play out but thought I would ask anyways.\n\nThank you! Any simple explanation would be appreciated!",

The only government body that would care is the IRS, but not for macroeconomic reasons (i.e. same reason China cares).\n\nThere's no reason not to be optimistic, and a lot has been done to address the problems of volatility and deflationary nature of older currencies. That said, just because progress is made doesn't mean that these problems are guaranteed to be \"solved.\" I'll believe when I see it, until then it might as well be in the realm of sci-fi and other cool \"what-ifs.\"\n\nI can't help but think it's ridiculous to assume that that cryptocurrencies *will* transform the global monetary system (or even has the capability of doing so). The most plausible scenarios I see are:\n\na) cryptocurrencies as we currently know them are entirely reinvented (and all the coins we use right now will be antiques and/or worthless). As much as crypto's have gained mainstream acceptance as a speculative investment, their use as a medium of exchange is going to stay niche unless some monumental hurdles are overcome.\n\nb) the climate disaster in the coming century ends up being far worse than anticipated and crypto's are favorably situated to be the most convenient medium of exchange. Basically, the same reason why unstable fiat currencies with unstable governments are really the only ones who have to worry about cryptocurrencies.",

There will be entities that report transactions, and who the transaction was with, at that point that wallet is IDed.  If you try and hide assets using multiple wallets, the more you transfer between them they can build a social network  from the IDed wallet.  Frequent transactions between two or more wallets, or circular transactions between three or more will establish a relationship.  If the relationship becomes too strong, it's becomes more and more likely to be the same person moving funds between public and private wallets to make publicly visible transactions.\n\nThe longer your wallet lives, the longer they can build an identity around it to determine it is you.  They don't have to focus on every wallet, just wallets that make transactions over $10k with known US entities.  Once they are IDed, they cross reference your tax records and if it isn't shown they audit your taxes, and now you owe back taxes on an unreported transaction from three years ago, plus fines and interest.  Very lucrative for them.",

That will likely continue for the foreseeable future, as each blockchain has its own specific wallet requirements. The place that many of these will differ will be between exchanges and private wallets. If you send crypto from an exchange that has KYC to a wallet that you own it should be easy to ID as you say due to the fact that you likely will be sending many transactions to that same wallet. You can also send coins to another exchange that you have accounts on. That may be easy, or not, to find depending on where in the world that exchange is located and how opaque their accounting system is. If you, then, exchanged one coin on one chain/wallet for another coin on another chain/wallet system and put the resulting coin into yet another privately held wallet, it can get really Byzantine really fast. \n\nI\u2019m not advocating avoiding tax. As a matter of fact I\u2019m advocating for regulation, but right now my guess is that the enforcement is going to lag for at least a while on this type of investigation. I\u2019ve no idea how sophisticated the IRS is when it comes to forensic electronic investigation, but if they are at all like several other major government agencies, they may be so far behind as to be nearly unable to cope.",

Do you care about the slave trade? In west Africa, the currency was glass beads. Europeans realized they could manufacture glass beads cheaply and bring them over by the boatload to go shopping. This left Africa with a lot of glass beads and Europe with all of their goods and possessions. When they were so impoverished, the logical next step was to buy the people themselves. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade\\_beads\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\\- and the rate at which that will increase.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I mean, you will also know the rate at which the US dollar will inflate\n\nYou don't, though.

God forbid I defend PayPal, but they're faster and cheaper than sending BTC. And that's saying something\n\nPaypal is not useful in many countries, especially places with high unbanked populations. It is also censored many places where it is needed most - Venezuela and Palestine for example. I send Bitcoin to unbanked family overseas far cheaper than any bank or remittance service can (due to exchanges batching transactions, my network fee is usually \\~$1), and they can exchange it for local currency faster and cheaper than any other method.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\\- You can secure it in sophisticated ways at a low cost compared to other things.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My US dollars are pretty secure in a standard bank account...\n\nUS Dollars have lost 99% of purchasing power over the past 100 years, and over that period of time, there have been numerous \"bank runs\" where customers try to withdraw their funds and the banks can't fulfill it. It's unlikely, but the time this would happen is when you need it most.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;None of what you said is attractive about changing your whole lifestyle just to go edgy and incorporate the use of Bitcoin as a CURRENCY in your life.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Guess why? Because it's not, and never will be, used as a currency by anyone. Too many hurdles\n\nI don't use it as a currency, and wouldn't advise anyone to - other than for large international transactions. It's interesting to see the government refer to them as \"cryptoassets\" here. I think it's more likely that some central banks will need to prop up their fiat currencies by backing them with Bitcoin. Furthermore, Bitcoin is likely to replace the USD as the global reserve currency, because it doesn't give the economic advantage of \"reserve\" status to a single nation, and it also makes more sense for international trade rather than pricing in petrodollar.",

I could send $1000 to Turkey let's say via WU for a 10% commission + exchange fees, or there are coins I could do it for maybe 5% exchanging from USD into Lira.\n\n\nThere are very real opportunities to totally revolutionise current payment systems and make them so much more efficient, I think that's the true power of digital currencies, and is obviously why CBDCs are becoming a thing.",

Once there is a defined set of standards and a regulatory framework to protect individual users / investors, I believe use-cases for the tech will skyrocket.\n\nThere is a reason why it's called web 3.0. It's an another layer of the internet.\n\nThough I agree this will be a challenge, especially from a regulatory perspective, given how decentralized networks work. I have no idea how regulators could possibly approach it, I have no experience in this particular field, I just hope they will remain constructive and not ignore the benefits this tech brings.",

From my understanding this means that if you send over $10k in crypto to an exchange, they will have to report it to the IRS. Coinbase already does this. They probably just want any exchange that serves US customers to do it as well. It just helps cut down on tax evasion and money laundering. Legitimate crypto investors who plan on paying their taxes will not be negatively affected by this in any way. Not sure why some people think this is the end of Bitcoin? If anything this further legitimizes it as an asset class.",

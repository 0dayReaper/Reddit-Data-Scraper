    "postText": "I've been investing in Canadian \"Total Return\" ETFs like [HXS](https://horizonsetfs.com/ETF/hxs/) with Horizons that provide 0 dividend and income and focus on capital growth over time. I'm looking for ETFs that capture the market in US listed  ETFs (e.g., VTI, SLY, etc.) but have 0.00% dividend. The main reasons are:\n\n1. I don't need the dividend. I'd rather have the money grow. It's kinda like [DRIP](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-is-a-drip/)s but a little more complicated.\n2. It'll simplify taxation at the end of the year\n3. It'll reduce my taxable income through reducing any realized gains in the near term.\n\nWhat do you recommend?",

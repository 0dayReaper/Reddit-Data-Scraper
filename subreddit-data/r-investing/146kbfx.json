Corporations in the US makes signficiant revenues from outside the country and are very well diversified.

I assume it would also be true for the EU too favouring companies that are traded in their own domestic currency rather than holding foreign based stocks. ",

USA companies demand a higher P/E ratio vs foreign companies.\n\nEmerging market stocks tend to have lower p/e due to economic/political/legal uncertainty vs developed markets.\n\nEven vs other developed markets USA stocks command a higher P/E due to higher historic growth and general innovation and other reasons.\n\nI can remember for a long time people saying USA stocks are over valued and looked at Russian stocks with something like an average P/E of 8 (It may have not been that low) saying they were a no brainier to invest in.\n\nOr people always confused why they traded so low ....well there was good reason because now in much of the developed world you cannot even trade Russian stocks.",

It also isn't the ex-US exposure that actually matters at all, what does matter is capturing how foreign stock markets behave, and no amount of KO or AAPL will do that for you.\n\nGoing properly global also helps diversify sectors, as over 1/4 of a US total market style fund is considered \"tech\" while ex-US has more from other sectors.\n\n&gt;Say what you will about current evaluations but there is no denying due to the US priveldged postion and tolerant culture has led to the outpreformance that we see now \n\nOr was it \"irrational exuberance\" over tech?\n\n* The last decade or so of US outperformance was mostly just the US getting more expensive, not US companies being much better than foreign companies: https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/The-Long-Run-Is-Lying-to-You (click through to the full version)\n\n&gt;and I expect it to continue.\n\nYou don't have much company among those in the industry:\n\nEx-US outperformance predicted: \n\n* https://advisors.vanguard.com/insights/article/areinternationalequitiespoisedtotakecenterstage or the archived link if that doesn't work: https://web.archive.org/web/20210104201135/https://advisors.vanguard.com/insights/article/areinternationalequitiespoisedtotakecenterstage\n\n* https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1018261/experts-forecast-stock-and-bond-returns-2021-edition (can see mention of it even before the paywall) or the 2023 version: https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1132887/experts-forecast-stock-and-bond-returns-2023-edition\n\n&gt;Another thing is a lack of confidence or competence (or both) for fund managers to concentrate into high quality equities, and favouring diversification into lower quality holdings to protect themselves from criticism or meet regulations. \n\n&gt;Do mutual funds lead to arficially inflated valuations for companies outside the US?\n\nNo. Since there are plenty of mutual funds that only focus on one country. Ever see VFIAX or VTSAX mentioned? Those are US only. \n\n&gt;Another thing is a lack of confidence or competence (or both) for fund managers to concentrate into high quality equities, and favouring diversification into lower quality holdings to protect themselves from criticism or meet regulations. \n\nCan you point to any regulations that would cause it?\n\nWhy are ex-US holdings lower quality than their valuations would already suggest?\n\n&gt;As I live in Canada I noticed most of the holdings in the mutual funds are primarily canadian equities, but with little us equities. I assume it would also be true for the EU too favouring companies that are traded in their own domestic currency rather than holding foreign based stocks. \n\nYou get to choose what type of fund you invest in. Not all will be so Canada focused. I know some Europeans use something like VUSA (which is US only; they may or may not pair it with something else), while others use a total world fund.\n\nEdit: Typos",

            "comment": "You are loosely describing a concept called Concentration Risk.  It's just another category of risk that fund managers manage, it's not a lack of confidence or competency.  Concentration risk has been around forever and there's a lot of historical data available in regards to it.   \nAs far as 'inflated valuation', that's subject to supply and demand just like any other asset class.  As money circulates, it's very common for certain asset classes to come into and out of favor, so valuations will fluctuate.  Ultimately valuations don't stay out of whack for long, fundamentals set their values long term.  I don't think there's any specific reason why mutual funds will cause artificial valuations, so I think the short answer is no.",

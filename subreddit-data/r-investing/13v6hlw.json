    "postText": "I have a brokerage account on Schwab that is managed by someone else. He's doing well for me over the past few years but the fees are too much.  I want to end the account and just put the money into ETFs in another account I manage. \n\nIf I end this active managed account do I keep the stocks? Or does the account close and all the stocks get sold? I'd prefer to keep the stocks he bought if I could.\n\nThank you",

Positions came over individually with the appropriate post basis like phosphate notes.  One thing to consider is that you may not want to sell all the stocks right away and move into ETFs all at once if you have capital gains as you'll have taxes due.  You may wish to consider matching gains with losses to minimize tax issues and also consider short vs. long-term capital gains - ie if you have short term gains potentially wait till they're long term.",

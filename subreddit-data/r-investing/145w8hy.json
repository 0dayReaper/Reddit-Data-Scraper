    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI had a hard time lately and I'm trying to reinvent myself.\n\nI'm a male 28 years old, born and living in the Netherlands. I lost a lot of money cause of a private situation that I won't have to deal with anymore.\n\nFor as now I want to make money and I'm prepared to learn and invest. Right now I don't have much money and any advice/ideas are appropriated. My income is like 6k euro net income per month. I just started as an IT engineer. I don't spend much money, don't go out much as I am somebody who rather goes to the gym than the club or go out drinking. \n\nLooking forward to advice, sources to learn from and help. Thanks!",

            "comment": "You can\u2019t change the past, but you can learn from it. Remember how you got into difficulties and avoid similar situations going forward.\n\n\nThe main thing for investing is to be consistent. Start with a realistic goal (such as \u2018deposit X amount in the next 3 months into my investment account\u2019) and then stick to it. Then increase the goal amount steadily as you are able. \n\nInvesting is not a way to get rich quickly. Don\u2019t gamble your money on speculative companies. Focus on investments that have demonstrated success already.\n\n\nDon\u2019t forget to enjoy life while you are still young. Use a portion of your resources to do things you enjoy and live a meaningful life. But don\u2019t waste money on frivolous luxuries.",

I think its important to note there are many ways to go about this and you need to answer some complicated questions in order to figure out which way is best for you. \n\nHow much effort do you want to put into \"investing\"? If alot, Then consider learning the macro market environment (Its trash right now) and time out your investments according to Boom and Bust cycles (As best you can anyway). For instance, In the US right now is the worst time in HISTORY to buy a house. So don't buy a house. If you don't want to put a lot of time into it, Save one years worth of bills as emergency funds and index/chill/DCA/etc. \n\nConsider positioning yourself to buy assets when appropriate. I personally believe Houses, Vehicles, Land, etc. are wildly overpriced but you can prepare to buy via research, acquiring funds, etc. \n\nDiversification. Stocks, Assets, Bonds, Commodities, and currencies. Some of these oppose each other (USDvs.EUR, STOCKSvs.BONDS) and as such must be viewed as hedging rather than a vehicle for growth (One goes up, One goes down and you equal out). Investing is about wealth preservation first and this covers you in that aspect. \n\nAll of this is not market advice but rather just my personal opinion and I am no professional. This is just what I believe and do.",

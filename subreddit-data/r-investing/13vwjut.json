    "postText": "So you know, something happened with these companies. They are accused of \"wokeism\" or whatever, and the stock crashed. I'm not super interested in talking about the virtues of doing or not doing (or doing then undoing) what they did. What I am interested in is, do you think the stock is super overreacting, like a reverse meme stock? \n\nBUD definitely has had some sales declines, but I don't know about Target and Kohls. Is it possible that earnings are going to come and everything will look fine or even good, then the stock pops because everybody realizes it was a social media overreaction? Or do you think they're taking real, heavy losses?\n\nEdit: consider in the past the outrage around Chick-fil-A and Hobby Lobby. While not publicly traded, they've obviously continued to grow in the years since their controversy. Consider also Tesla, which has an image deeply intertwined with its CEO and has [plunged rapidly](https://www.axios.com/2023/05/23/ftx-tesla-reputation-rankings-2021) in brand rankings, with sales becoming flat.",

I briefly looked at Target as well.\r\n\nThe recent earnings and guidance sounded very cautious. Revenue is flat. And Target expects shrinkage to reduce profits by more than 500 million. I'm not very familiar with retail sales but the shrinkage number seems really high and I have read that it's been a big problem for retailers. \r\n\nTarget maintained their guidance for the year but said it was due to cost-savings efforts. That sounds like Target doesn't expect much growth.",

Nobody knows where you bought it.\n\nSo if earnings come out and it turns out it didn't really affect sales, it may rise.",

I've seen headlines that Bud Light is down by 28% in sales, but if that's only a fraction of their total sales across all brands then it might be a blip.

I live in a small town outside of El Paso and I haven't seen pride merch at the local Walmart. Most of the folks here are blue collar working class family people. I see a lot of construction workers and others in trade professions. But I am glad you pointed it out because just out of curiosity I am going to pay attention what the local Walmart does in the days and months to come. Walmart is such a staple for many Americans I don't see any boycott being successful. They just tend to have lower prices than other stores and provide the convenience of being a one stop shop. You basically have everything you need at Wally world.",

And they did likewise for other influencers as well.\n\nAB didn't alienate anyone by doing this. A certain subset of their customers - and I'd bet even more who weren't even customers - were given cause to outrage by agenda pushers and took the bait hook, line and sinker (because people who get outraged by things like this are controlled by their emotions which is ironic coming from the \"facts don't care about your feelings\" crowd).\n\nTarget has had LGBTQ+ related paraphernalia for years that has largely gone without controversy until now, all of a sudden, it's an issue.

The way you've described the content, it doesn't seem to be. So therefore, should it not be the parents' responsibility to not allow their children to watch?

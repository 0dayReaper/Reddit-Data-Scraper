    "postText": "Hello. I\u2019m trying to help my mother out with her IRA. \n\nSome info about her:\nShe is 67 years old, still working, and not collecting Social Security yet. She realistically probably has several more years of work left, as she works at a grocery store and is paying a mortgage. I believe she will have a pension upon retirement, unsure of its value.\n\nShe\u2019s always told me to invest in a Roth IRA; fast forward 15 years to find out while she\u2019s been contributing to hers, she\u2019s only been contributing to the core account and not actually investing it past an initial two investments back in 2004 that a friend helped her do.\n\nShe invested $3k in FFFCX, Fidelity Freedom 2010 Fund. She currently has $7k in it, and $53k in cash (FDRXX).\n\nLooking at the chart for FFFCX on Google, from when she invested (2004 to today) it\u2019s showing a -9.23% return but yet she\u2019s up from $3k to $7k, +142%, according to her account. I\u2019m not too familiar with TDFs and bonds, but I know the performance charts typically don\u2019t correlate directly to gains.\n\nCan someone clarify?\n\nAlso at a fee of 0.48%, I want to pull her from this and set up a 3 fund basic portfolio. Something like VTI/VXUS/BND.\n\nThoughts on this too?\n\nThanks!",

This is gonna be a little harsh, but since you\u2019re posting on reddit, maybe not.\n\nI think the #1 priority is getting the cash invested. Less than 0.5% really isn\u2019t that high of an expense ratio for an active fund. Maybe get her into a 2025 TDF if she still has a few more working years. Maybe 2020 if she wants to be more conservative.\n\nI\u2019d probably just lump sum it all, but you could invest it over 3 months if she\u2019s worried about volatility. Then just set and forget.",

Much different tolerance than me at half her age.\n\nI can see if Fidelity offers a 2025 version, thank you. Maybe I can find out what it\u2019s comprised of to try to re-create it with a 3-fund in a similar allocation, to cut down on expense ratios. A 3-fund would be roughly 1/10th of her current TDF, even though the balance isn\u2019t huge enough to be a major concern.",

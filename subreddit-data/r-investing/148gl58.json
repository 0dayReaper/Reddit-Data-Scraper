    "postText": "My impression if buying VOO/VTI similar fund track S&amp;P 500 performance. Hypothetically return average rate of 10 percent (the fund grow by 10 percent per year), doesn't this mean in 30 years, the 10k will be worth $330,000?\n\n10k * 1.10 * 30?\n\nOr does it apply 10 percent annual return rate after 10k has appreciated to 11k? \n\nMy gut feeling tells me it is not compound since this is not a saving account and merely following index fund.\n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you everyone for your answer to the post. Sorry for the insane typos in the title.",

Also if it does grow on average of 10% a year due to compounding it will double in value in a little over  7 years (not 10) and again this is due to compound growth\n\nbut as the other user said the math is wrong, and in 30 years 10k at 10% annual growth will end up at approx $174,500",

It is not as if I'm loaning the money anywhere or doing any kind of \"buy and sell\". \n\nFor example, if I buy a share of Apple for $100. I will only own the share. In the 10 years, the value of the share rises to $200 and I can pocket $200 if I sell it.\n\nWhy didn't compound interest apply to the growth of Apple stock here? Since ETF, such as VTI/VOO, are almost like 'stock' and have their own allocation between different S&amp;P500 listed companies.",

                            "comment": "I think, perhaps, there is a small misunderstanding of what the term compounding means in this context and in relation to annual interest rates.  \n  \nSince you are using an *annual* interest rate, your default time period is one year.  $10k x 10% annual percentage rate = $1k of interest after one year.  And total value is now $11k after year one.   \n\nIf you do not take out that $1k and spend it or do something else with it \u2014 if you leave it invested and the original $10k plus the earned interest of $1k *both* earn interest over the course of year two, then after year two you have $12.1k total ($11k x 10% plus the starting balance of $11k).  \n  \nThis is important:  You earned more interest in year two than you did in year one.   \n  \nThe reason that you earned more interest in yr 2 is because the interest from yr 1 was *compounded* into the starting value for year two (or you could say it was added to the original principal).  And then so on and so on through the rest of the years.  \n\nIt\u2019s also possible you are thinking about this math in terms of number of shares, not the dollar value of shares.   The numeric quantity of shares does not have to increase for compound interest to apply.   It is the increase in dollar value that shows the compounding effect.  \n  \nIn your Apple example of going from $100 to $200, you could say the return was 100% over the entire time period.  But the time period in question is not one year and so the average *annual* rate of return would be much lower \u2014 something like 7.2%.   \n  \nYour investment would increase by 7.2% per year for 10 years and \u2014 taking into consideration the increasing investment value from year to year \u2014 after 10 years your investment would be worth $200.  Note that this assumes you have the same *number* of Apple shares.  It\u2019s just the dollar value that has increased over time.",

Then your returns would be additive instead of multiplicative: 50% + 33.3% = 83.3%. But we already know you bought $100 of AAPL and it became worth $200, ergo the returns compound.",

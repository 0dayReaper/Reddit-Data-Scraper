Knowing that everyone in town wanted to work with him after Barbarian, they pretty much just locked him in with a producing fee, then marketed the script to New Line as a way to work with him in the future.",

People who make 1 phone call or go to 1 crucial meeting can become producers and a lot of the time that one thing they did was as crucial as anything else on the road to making a project happen. One of many reasons the producer title is so nebulous to so many. If you produce results, you are doing (part of) the job of a producer.",

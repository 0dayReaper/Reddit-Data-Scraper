Basically B-movies playing to the crowd and trying to make an easy buck. A lot of eventual cult classics were created this way.\n\n\"Blaxploitation\" became a term for the subgenre of exploitation films specifically aimed at a Black audience, at least originally. Think *Shaft* or *Dolemite*.",

While idiots like Critical Drinker may make 87 videos about Daisy Ridley and Brie Larson, most actual Star Wars fans with a negative opinion on the Disney trilogy target their ire toward JJ Abrams, Rian Johnson, and Kathleen Kennedy for allowing the mess to happen. They dislike Rey fundamentally as a character, but 99.99% of them have no ill will toward Daisy Ridley. It\u2019s the extremely vocal, mentally ill 00.01% that sends death threats, which is then amplified by social media and conflated with the rest of the criticism.",

That anybody who dislikes the ST must be a misogynist? Do we all just pretend to like Leia, Padme, and Ahsoka? Or does that not benefit your argument?   \n\n\nI'm highly critical of the sequels for several reasons and have discussed them in-depth with both sides of the community, but rarely do you see people shitting on Daisey as a person. Nobody in their right mind would turn down the chance to star in Star Wars, she was just let down by those higher up.\n\nAlso, you're not considering that the main character, *which in this case is Rey*, often gets levied the most criticism because they're on-screen the most.",

It's why he struggled to find work for a little while. \n\n&gt;According to sources, there seemed to be no one incident that prompted Boyega to leave in the midst of shooting. Several insiders, however, say the star had myriad issues ranging from the script to his accommodations. \n\n&gt;Top Netflix executives, including head of global films Scott Stuber and co-CEO Ted Sarandos, tried to persuade the star to return to the set without success. Dozens of crewmembers on the project were let go after Boyega\u2019s departure as the production disbanded.",

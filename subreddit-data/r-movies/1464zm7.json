    "postText": "A little while ago there was a discussion about the best sequels of all time. It was great, we covered all the usual ones like Godfather Part II, Terminator 2, Empire Strikes Back, etc. \n\nBut what about 3quals? Or the 4th movie in a series? And so on, til about the 8th movie in a franchise\u2026 Can we establish a definitive list of amazing sequels in their respective numerical slots? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the purposes of this list, I would count a film like Iron Man 3 (2013) as the 3rd film in the series, as opposed the 9th movie in the franchise. I would also consider Star Wars Episode 5 to be the second film in the franchise. \n\nI will start us off. \n\n2. The Godfather Part II (1974)\n\n3. The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (2003)\n\n4. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n\n5. Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation (2015)\n\n6. On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service (1969)\n\n7. Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)\n\n8. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 (2011)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to eviscerate my choices as I have a clear \u2018recency bias\u2019. But what are your preferences? ",

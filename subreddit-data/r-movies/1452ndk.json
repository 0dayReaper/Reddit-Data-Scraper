If you're looking for more movies in that style, I'd recommend checking out \"Crash\" (2004), directed by Paul Haggis. It weaves together multiple storylines and characters from different backgrounds, exploring themes of race, class, and identity. Another one to consider is \"Cloud Atlas\" (2012), co-directed by the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer. It spans different time periods and interconnects various narratives, creating a thought-provoking experience. Enjoy the ride!",

After all this API business, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m going to leave Reddit, and the thing I\u2019ll probably miss most (besides various communities) is the news and movie recs from this subreddit. Where else can I find this type of news? Is there a good YouTube channel for it?",

I like most of them hosts, they have good editors, but it's ... Marvel. I just don't give a shit. \n\nYes I get that's the easiest clickbait, or was at least since that fanaticism seems to be finally fading a little, but there's so so many other good movies out there. \n\nAnd when it comes to the channels who review other than just \"popcorn entertainment\" movies, they seem to be just... bland. I'm sorry, but sense of humor doesn't seem to follow channels, who review other than Marvel/Fast/Dc/starwars movies too. Nor do they have the kind of... witty editors, to make even normal talk seem funnier, simply because the images on screen. \n\nThat's my rant for today, thanks for reading.",

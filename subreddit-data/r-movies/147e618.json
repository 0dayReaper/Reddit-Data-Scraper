    "postText": "Last year I decided to watch as many Christmas movies as possible during December and even thought there is hundreds of great Christmas movies like The Grinch who stole Christmas, Die Hard, Home Alone, The nightmare before Christmas, The Santa Claus, Klaus (a new favorite) and so many others I quickly ran out of movies I could watch without spending a fortune buying or renting so I did the next best thing and that was look for lesser known Christmas movies with actors I like and that's when I found Falling for Christmas (not a Hallmark movie but definitely feels like one) and I genuinely enjoyed it even though it's a Netflix movie it definitely feels like a Hallmark movie. \n\nIs there a Hallmark movie or a movie that feels like a Hallmark movie that you genuinely enjoyed?",

            "comment": "There are several that are watchable. These are not movies I actively seek out, but with so many relatives I have who love the Hallmark Channel, the Hallmark content invariably gets absorbed whether you want it to or not.\n\nChristmas Next Door \n\nChristmas in Evergreen (there are 3, the first is the best but the other two are decent)\n\nThe Most Wonderful Time of the Year (this has Henry Winkler in it, and I would say this is the best one I've seen)\n\nThere is watchable non-Christmas content on Hallmark, too. \n\nThe Gourmet Detective Series (there are 5 movies, and this rips off the \"Castle\" TV murder mystery series, but it's a nice rip-off.)\n\nA Martha's Vineyard Mystery series -- I believe there are 4 movies, and they're all pretty good. There's a running storyline about who betrayed the lead Boston Detective but each movie is essentially a standalone film. There are returning characters in this one.\n\nAmazon Prime has a decent addition to the Hallmark Universe type film world -- \"Something from Tiffany's\" is a decent film. I was visiting my Aunt and Mom and they were watching this one recently.",

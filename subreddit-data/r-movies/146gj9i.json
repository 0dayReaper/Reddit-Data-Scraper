    "postText": "Spongebob Squarepants The Movie was a favorite of mine as a kid. I loved the show, so naturally, I would love the movie, and even as an adult, I still think it's amazing. \n\nSpongebob never disappoints, but i love this movie, i loved it as a kid, and i still love it now, and it still holds up to this day. The amount of Heart, Soul, Care, Love, Time, Patience, and Effort put into this is Incredible, especially since it actually feels like a movie and not just an extra long episode of the show, with a fantastic message about how its okay to be a kid at heart while still being an adult, and so many great, dramatic and funny moments, the Bar bit will always have me laughing, and the moment when Spongbob and patrick realize they made it to shell city as they are dying will always bring a tear to my eye, and the David Hassellhoff stuff was also really cool.\n\nAnd not only does this hold up, but this is also a beautiful send-off to not just the original series, but also SpongeBob's legacy as a whole in general (or it should be), as well as a touching and wonderful Love Letter to Stephen Hillenburg. Id like to thank him for everything he did to make this film the way it is, and i salute him for making our childhoods the Best Childhoods ever. I enjoyed it, if not deeply loved it, from beginning too end. :) \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a not to mention, Dennis is a legitimately great secondary villain, and Mindy is hot. 10/10.",

The last samurai was a white mans idea of how it would have gone down, knowing it went down, but not knowing a single detail. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the script is just so far tweaked from original, that it makes sense, but the last samurai was entertaining and historically should be considered to have been a different universe than ours. Love the movie, it\u2019s like the original terminator for me. I\u2019m down to get really high and watch it, but It\u2019s just the interim to t2 or gladiator. Gladiator is also ridiculously inaccurate, but who cares. Just like t2 was better than terminator, gladiator is better than a movie that came out a decade later, has no overlapping crew (didn\u2019t look up if that\u2019s true, it\u2019s probably just not), and did the same thing.

            "comment": "this movie is really special to me because my dad worked a lot growing up. as a gen z\u2019er, SpongeBob is quite literally my childhood. I grew up endlessly watching the reruns and the newer episodes because I didn\u2019t realize those weren\u2019t as good until I was in my teens lol, but SoongeBob was my jam. \n\nI remember being 6 when this movie came out and how badly I wanted to see it. I kept begging my dad to take me and he kept saying \u201coh this day\u201d \u201cno sorry not today\u201d \u201cthis day\u201d blah blah blah. I don\u2019t blame my dad, but as a kid I was totally bummed. \n\nand here comes my grandma to the rescue, man. she pulled me out of daycare early and we went and saw the fuckin\u2019 SpongeBob movie and it blew my little six year old mind. \u201cdid they see my butt?\u201d Goofy Goober Rock, Plan Z, Now That We\u2019re Men, etc. up until that point it was the best movie I had ever seen. \n\nI\u2019m sure to my grandma it was just another day in the life but she had no idea how much that meant to me growing up. that in a moment of need where nobody was coming through for me, my grandma made sure I got to see the SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. I rewatched it during lockdown and found myself feeling super nostalgic and sentimental, especially not being able to see anyone so I sent my grandma a nice and long text to let her know how much that meant to me. \n\nThe SpongeBob SquarePants Movie is the shit.",

NEPTUNE\u2019s crown.\u201d and as Mr. Krabs is frantically beating up the phone \u201cwhichisnowinshellcitygoodbye.\u201d LMFAO",

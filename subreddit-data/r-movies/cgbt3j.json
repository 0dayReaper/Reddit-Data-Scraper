Like, my entire area had \u201csnakes on a plane\u201d fever. Local theater did a midnight showing. My friends and I immediately bought tickets and started planning for a fun and interesting evening, so we go to the party supply store and buy a fuck ton of rubber snakes. Cue opening night. We drank a bit and snuck in some beers like responsible people do at the movies. The theater was packed. Like, marvel movie midnight showing packed. Apparently we weren\u2019t the only ones with the idea to drink during the movie, so basically the entire movie was popping beers and mixing vodka into overpriced sodas. Then, as soon as snakes started showing up, we started throwing our rubber snakes... just as a few other groups of people started throwing their rubber snakes. It was hilarious pandemonium. Snakes everywhere, beers popping, people cheering every time Samuel L Jackson mentioned a snake. To this day, that was one of the most fun theater experiences I\u2019d ever had. My group and another group stuck around after the credits and helped the staff clean up and some of the workers cleaning were part of (which we didn\u2019t know at the time) a group that was also drinking and throwing snakes. They were so grateful we stuck around to help out, they gave us a few free vouchers for movies. I\u2019ve still got a few of those rubber snakes to this day.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I typed this all out. Just in a good mood and wanted to share, I guess.",

They might want to push Avatar back on top so they can advertise Avatar 2 as \"the sequel to the highest grossing film of all time\".",

It started the 3D revolution and no one came after to take the flame.\n\nIt looks fine on Bluray, but the 3D experience is what made this movie into an unique experience. There's a reason some people had a 'post-Pandora' depression after their viewing.\n\nNow apparently he worked really hard on the sequels' scripts because he knows that was the weak point of the first movie. That coupled with HFR, I have no doubt in my mind that the Avatar sequels will obliterate this record.",

In fact it only had the 8th largest opening weekend of 1997 and its opening wasn\u2019t even half that of the top opening of the year, The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Titanic was different than nearly every other movie in that it had the best week-on-week holds of any movie ever made. It opened at $28 million then in its second week made about $8 million more than the first while only adding ~25 theaters and then it continued barely dropping for its entire run. \n\nI can\u2019t say for 100% but I don\u2019t think any other movie ever has opened wide and then made more money in its second weekend than it did in its first. That is absolutely insane. But let\u2019s be clear, Titanic wasn\u2019t a box office juggernaut destroying any competition in its path, it was more the little train that could chugging along further than anyone ever could have believed.",

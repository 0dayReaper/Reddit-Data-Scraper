    "postText": "I usually drive 10 minutes away for the Dolby Cinema because it is a most impressive experience.  A smaller theater down the block from my house has an XQ+DTS:X screen.  They describe it as 4k and just as good as Dolby atmos..but i\u2019m incredulous.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any technical knowledge or even first hand experience to compare the 2 types? Is dolby cinema in a different league or is XQ really a comparison?\n\nThanks friends!!",

It is actually an answer to a similar concept that Dolby Laboratories have come up with : Dolby Cinema. \nDTS: X and Dolby Atmos are about the sound : they are 3D spatial sound technologies. \nFrom classic cinemas website we can learn that the XQ concept use the DTS: X for the sound with no information on the particulars of the room or about the projection used. \nDolby Cinema concept with a room conceived from the onset for the most strict customers, Dolby Vision HDR for the projection (on movies recorded with Dolby Vision) and Dolby Atmos for the sound, allows to blurs the limit between  simple projection and reality.",

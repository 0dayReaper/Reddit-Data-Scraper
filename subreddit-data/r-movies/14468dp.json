Not the most well-thought satire in the world, but satire nonetheless.  \n\nI watched one of them for the first time a few weeks back after scoffing at them for a decade and, tbqh, despite being a little on the nose it was fine. I think the only way you could take it as not satire or parody is if you a) have poor media literacy b) are actively looking for something else to take away from it.  \n\nThey are of course still bonkers ridiculous movies. But the underlying political bent is far and away anti-gun and anti-wealth accumulation.",

And if they realize there is a point at which they stop believing in that thing, it makes them think twice about why they believe in it when it's not at that extreme. It's meant to expose how silly those beliefs are.\n\nThe Purge completely fails to be anti gun or even satire. It doesn't take the idea of owning a gun to an extreme, it takes the idea of having no laws/police to an extreme. Gun owners don't want there to be no rules or for people to be allowed to just go kill each other for no reason. In fact it reinforces the actual concept gun owners believe in which is that you want a gun to be able to protect yourself from crazy people and when the government fails.",

The mask production company, the NFFA kids show, the Emergency Broadcast voice auditions. Great stuff.\n\nThe season itself was also great but doing a whole year in 10 episodes meant so many time skips. \n\nSeason 1 had to much plot for one Purge night (and still dragged in some parts) but Season 2 did not have enough to justify it taking place over a year period.",

The conscious intended *statements* by artists really have nothing necessarily to do with understanding what the movie does, what effect it has, what subtexts it *actually* conveys, and so on.\n\nEveryone knows what I'm saying is true.  For example:  imagine a complete idiot who makes an art project, and it's a horrible mangled garbage stupid piece of art.  Then later they *explain* all the \"meanings\" and \"messages\" and \"themes\" to you.  Does that mean the messages and themes are *actually* there and communicated in an effective artistic identifiable perceivable way?  Of course not.  But even though everyone knows what I'm saying is true, they'll scream about how random side-statements made by an artist fully determine everything we should think about the art.",

He is the leader of a team that conducts elaborate heists on Purge night. It also follows a couple other subplots such as someone trying to figure out who ordered a hit on them on Purge night (before it happens again the next year), and someone who kills in self-defense on Purge night, develops a taste for it and is radicalized by pro-Purge propaganda over the following year.\n\nI don\u2019t want to give away more, but season 2 of the TV show is one of the best things this franchise has done, partially because it does exactly what you say.\n\nSeason 1 does this too, to a lesser extent (ie showing millionaires kidnapping women on Purge night for sex crimes, cults that sacrifice willing cultists during the Purge \u2014 that type of stuff).",

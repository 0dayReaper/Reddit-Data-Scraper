The screenplay is so good, i feel it beeing written in all caps and the cast work just accentuates it (it kinda reminds me of Glengarry Glen Ross). I rewatched it today and just now i realized Kendall Roy was in it, wich makes my experience even better.\n\nMore things that i loved about it: The fourth wall breaks and the Margot Robbie cameo.\n\nI can't tell wtf is happening with AI, NVIDIA and shit, but i hope Fincher or Adam MacKay would tell us about it.\n\n\n(Pardon for my grammar)\n\nEdit: ok, i was trying to be funny about beeing dumb, but maybe it wasn't recieved so well. As a portuguese native speaker, i'm trying to learn english, so i watch almost everything with english subtitles, but i'm really bad at english business, so it's a little bit difficult to understand some terms in this movie. I hope someday i can understand everything even without a subtitle.",

Having 100 people each owe you $1million is safer than having one person owe you $100million.  Some of those 100 borrowers probably will go insolvent, and won\u2019t be able to pay you back, but most of them will.  If your one big creditor who owes you all of your money goes bankrupt, you lose the whole thing.\n\nIn practice, the bundling and splitting up of loans meant that banks were more lax about their lending standards.  If I\u2019m Bank of America and I\u2019m approving loans, I care pretty heavily about whether these people can actually pay me back.  I\u2019m not lending you money if I think you will not be able to pay me back.\n\nBut if I\u2019m eventually going to chop that loan up and keep 10% of the loan for myself and sell the other 90% of it to 9 banks equally, we each care a little less about the risk that you default.  All of the banks became more lenient about giving out loans to people who would eventually not be able to pay them back.  Once that started happening en masse, the banks started getting into trouble financially.",

But those were simple, and everyone knew that they were risky.\n\nIn order to mitigate that risk, the banks created a second structure, a \"Collateralised Debt Obligation\" (CDO). These CDOs consisted of these MBS, but they were horizontally separated into different tranches. The lower tranches would be the first to absorb any losses from defaults in the underlying mortgages. In order to compensate investors, these tranches simultaneously had the highest yield. \n\nThe higher you go in this tower, the lower the yield, but the less likely that you would incur any losses. That is how the highest tranches were rated as \"investment grade\", because you had all of these lower tranches as a buffer for defaults. Theoretically, they should be safe. At least that was how it was supposed to work in theory.\n\nWhat almost everyone missed was that the underlying assumptions about the rate of defaults in the underlying mortgages were wrong. The reason for that was that  these mortgages were almost always \"floating rate\" ones, i.e. they adjust based on the current interest rate in the market. The problem with that was that interest rates were eventually starting to rise, and instead of seeing a couple of defaults in these subprime mortgages, suddenly virtually *all of them* defaulted.\n\nThat meant that your supposedly safe upper CDO tranches were suddenly not safe at all, but were getting wiped out along with everything else. That was the problem at the core of all of this: The people building these structures failed to recognise that rising interest rates would lead to much higher rates of defaults in the underlying mortgages than what they had modelled. That led to a chain reaction of losses not only in these products, but also for anyone who had (often massive) exposure to them.\n\nThis was made even worse, because you had geniuses like AIG who thought they extremely smart for making a risk-free profit by selling large amounts of \"credit default swaps\" (basically a type of put option) on these upper CDO tranches that couldn't possibly default.",

It's a way of gambling with a back up plan, and, again, only established traders can do this, and often brokerage houses will put in a clause that if the price drops, they want cash, not their shares back. This has made many \"sure things\" go bust.\n\nHowever in The Big Short, our characters borrowed shares of XYZ bank from the brokerage house with the expectation that the share prices will plummet. They were the only ones thinking this, the brokerage houses expected those shares to go up because the housing market was so strong. So when our characters asked for an exemption from the policy of not taking the shares back if the price dropped, the brokerage house was like \"lol fine, knock yourselves out!\"\n\nSo let's say they borrowed the shares at $100 a pop, and borrowed 100 shares. That's $10,000. And let's say they got a term of six months. So in six months, they owed the brokerage house either 100 shares or $10,000. Again, this is simplified, it was likely a lot more shares at a much higher rate, I'm just trying to keep the math simple.\n\nSo then our characters, convinced the drop was coming, sold the borrowed shares for $10,000. The put that into their pockets. And then, a couple weeks later, as they expected, the priced bottomed out, say $10 a share. In a panic, people were selling, so they bought their 100 shares back at $10 a pop, or $1000. Then they returned them to the brokerage house, keeping the $90,000 difference as a profit.\n\nThe brokerage house, on paper, was fine, as it didn't lose any shares. It's shares lost money, and they were fucked there, but it was totally legal.\n\nOur characters, on the other hand, got away scott-free with their profits, also legally, by betting that the shares would drop. \n\nIt's risky, but this is called \"shorting\" and that's how they actually made their money in the film.",

If it hasnt dropped in value yet, you just paid a lot of interest *and* youve lost money on the buyback. And in this case, where there was a massive bubble and the value of the stock will remain high until the bubble suddenly pops, defaulting on the interest payments before the pop would be catastrophic and youd lose everything.\n\nin the big short, you see the interest payments get mentioned a few times- Dr Michael Burry (Bale) nearly bankrupts his hedge fund covering the interest payments before the buybacks, which is why all the investors get all mad and start asking for their money.\n\nJared Vennet (Gosling) mentions it on the phone a couple times, but the most important one is when hes explaining why hes trying to rope other firms (Mark Baum, Carrell) in on his deal.. Basically the same as dr burry, but without the power to control it himself. The people giving Vennet money think hes crazy and are about to stop supplying him with the money to cover the interest payments. But if he can sell off a good chunk of his short position, then that provides him with immediate return, as well as potential validation for future credit default swaps.",

Which meant when interest rates went up, and all those loans defaulted pretty much simultaneously, the bottom fell out of nearly every *bank* in America.\n\nIt would have been bad enough if investors were the only ones getting screwed, but you kinda sign up for that possibility somewhat as an investor. But banks are supposed to be safe, conservative, institutions. Places where you stick your money and it will still be there when you come back for it. In this case it became apparent that the basic financials for every bank was built on a house of cards, and that house just fucking collapsed. Hence the massive bailouts.",

I\u2019m with you in blaming the ratings agencies because a lot of these people probably thought at some point somebody would blow the whistle on it if it were that bad, but they didn\u2019t. But if every single dogshit mortgage you write is automatically going to be bought by a bigger bank to be sold as an MBS, why wouldn\u2019t you do it? It\u2019s basically free money. The original broker would have no reason to expect they would still be at risk because they would assume everyone else was doing their jobs. \n\nMy uncle worked as a loan officer at the time, and because he\u2019s an extremely paranoid guy he started telling everyone that something fishy was going on because he was basically being told not to do his job and just give everyone a mortgage, and yet the housing market was booming. My grandfather, despite being an investor, has always avoided real estate, so those two things combined caused my grandfather to pull back a lot of his assets and quite honestly might\u2019ve saved our families asses.",

What I did notice with so much easy money to be made and virtually *zero* barrier to entry, the industry attracted people short on ethics and intellect and long on greed.  The line from the broker who said something to the tune of, \"just a year ago, I was a bartender; now I own a boat,\" only later to be just another face at a job fair was so dead on accurate.  The swagger with little substance to back it up is what I found hilariously accurate, as I worked in the secondary marketing department of a mortgage bank and we had tons of brokers exactly like those two.",

Like any insurance policy, you pay a premium even if you never make a claim.  You make a monthly car insurance payment and if your car gets totaled, the insurance company buys you a new one.  If nothing happens, the insurance company keeps the revenue.\n\nTypically a credit default swap (CDS) is bought by a creditor/lender to offset the risk of default by the borrowers.  In the Bale example, he bought insurance on bonds he didn't own.  The much decried arrogance of these banks let them underwrite these CDS's because they couldn't imagine the bonds defaulting.  This is why Bale's boss was so irate:  he thought all of the fund's capital would be eroded by simply paying premiums to insure an event that was unlikely to incur.\n\nBut Bale did his research.  So did Steve Carrell's team as well as the other two young guys.  They all figured out that all of these loans had terrible underwriting.  Loans given to people whose income was not verified.  Loans given with a \"teaser\" rate which would jump up in 2 or 3 years.  Basically, the entire industry was predicated on the assumption that home values would just keep going up.  And when the loans started defaulting, holders of the CDS would then collect their money.  They were betting *against* the housing market.  So when it collapsed, they won.\n\nIn understanding how poor the fundamentals were on the portfolio of loans, Bale and company took out insurance on them.  It'd be like learning your neighbor was cooking meth in his home and you could take out a fire insurance policy on his home and be the beneficiary.\n\nThe thing that Richard Thaler and Selena Gomez explained was that so many people were placing bets *outside* of the actual parties to the underlying transaction.  So the market was orders of magnitude bigger.\n\nHopefully that helps.",

That's interest on the loan. \nIf you are a pensioner with lots of savings but no job you need income. So you buy bonds which pay interest and that interest is your income.\nAny platform will let you buy bonds.\nBut most of the exotic shit they talk about is beyond retail investors reach because it is super risky.\nFor example the CDOs are just a bunch of debts bundled together, but they are specific debts. They are ones backed by hard assets such as a house or a car.\nYou can probably buy those actually.\nWhat is hard to buy as a retail investor is the CDS.\nThat's insurance on a debt. Say you are buying debt from Microsoft. It is very unlikely to fail to pay its debts (called defaulting) so insurance cover on such a debt is cheap. However if MSFT hit turbulent times and looked like it didn't have the cash to pay for it's debt then insurance on that debt would be VERY expensive. The chance that insurance has to pay out is high so insurance is expensive. Like car insurance for teens.\nSo if you think debts wil default buy the insurance and you have effectively shorted the debt. You will make money if the debt isn't paid. Boom.",

They (the banks, ratings agencies, with the help of government regulatory agencies) were **lying** about the health of mortgages within CDOs (and other financial products) in order to a) sell them as \"low risk\", b) rehypothecate / leverage them to make BAAAAANK. Trillions of dollar dollar bills yo. \n\nThis is what the whole Selena Gomez gambling scene was about. This is what the scene between Bale and his partner (Paraphrasing: \"Have you actually read the mortgages? - I have. They're lying.\") was all about.\n\nThis scene (starting at 4:03 in video) is oversimplified, but does explain the gist of what was going on: https://youtu.be/xbiDrzTd8fE?t=243\n\n2008 was about Fraud. Pure and total fraud. Massive, enormous institutional fraud at the highest levels of finance and government. A few people saw the fraud simply by \"looking\" at what was in these finanaical products (\"we did what no one else bothered to do....we loooked\")...and bet on the whole system failing when the market finally realized what was going on.\n\nYou remember the ending monologue, when Carell's character says \"They'll do what they've always done. Blame poor people and immmigrants.\"\n\nThat's exactly what happened. \"Don't take on a mortgage you can't afford!\". \"The banks mistake was lending to poor people and taking on too much risk!\". This was **not** the problem in 2008. **Fraud** was the problem. But making people think the problem was banking risk *was* and *is* why multi-trillion dollar fraud...that collapsed the global economy and crushed the economies of 3 nation states...has never been prosecuted.\n\nDon't worry though. The people behind that fraud were all hired into the Obama administration, remained through Trump &amp; Biden all the way till present day. And the public still don't know what the fuck happened in 2008, because the financial press (mostly staffed by ex banking peeps) doesn't want you to know. And it's fraud that continues to this day, and will at sometime in the future, cause the same problem all over again.",

I watched this movie when I was in my last year of high school and absolutely loved it, to the point the financial concepts got me interested in the industry and lead me to my current job. Must\u2019ve watched it a dozen times in a couple years. \n\nFast forward now and I\u2019ve been working in the securitisation arm of a bank for a year now, in mortgage backed securities nonetheless. For reference, this is basically the subsection of finance this movie is about. Having not watched in 5 years I thought it\u2019d be fun to watch it again now I\u2019m actually directly in the industry. I was scared it\u2019d be like when a doctor watches a medical drama and they hate it because how unrealistic it is but I was surprised I still love it. The concepts are well explained considering the audience they\u2019re targeting while there\u2019s some exaggeration of course, that\u2019s completely understandable considering the audience. The way Bales character was analysing the individual mortgages in a CDO, the shilling at the Vegas securitisation conference and dumbass greedy mortgage brokers who would sell a shitty loan to their mother for the commission are all things I\u2019ve experienced. That Vegas conference was especially trippy because I forgot that was in the movie and when it showed up I was like \u201cwait I just came back from that\u201d.",

Still, there is SO much jargon and complexity that it can be hard to stick with, and easy to get lost, unless you already have an interest in the subject matter and really want to understand what happened.  \n\nI was very happy a few years later when I heard it was being made into a movie.  \n\nThe movie went on to win the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.  As someone who does understand everything in the book I can say emphatically that that was one of the most well-deserved Oscars in the history of cinema.  They did an absolutely MASTERFUL job of turning that book into a coherent, enjoyable movie narrative.  Seriously, read the book and then think about what they had to do to turn that into a watchable, entertaining script that regular people could follow.  Holy shit.",

            "comment": "There is an ELi5 on it...\n\nLet's say you have a friend who runs a lemonade stand and it's grown so successful that he sells shares in it. Now, things seem to be going pretty well for the lemonade stand and everyone seems to think that it will have a glowing future but you aren't so sure. Instead, you think that something bad is about to happen and that the stock is actually about to drop.\n\nBeing an unscrupulous five year old, you'd quite like to be able to profit from this and thanks to the process of shorting, you can. The first thing you need to do is find someone who holds shares and ask if you can borrow some of them. Obviously, this being an equally unscrupulous five year old, he's not going to this purely for the fun of it but says he will agree if you agree to pay him a fee. In the end, he decides that he'll lend you \u00a3100 worth of stock for a week if you give him \u00a310.\n\nSo you've got you're \u00a3100 composed of 100 borrowed stock (so each stock is worth \u00a31) and the first thing you need to do is sell them. As a consequence, you now have \u00a3100 cash in your pocket but you still need to return 100 stocks to the lender + the \u00a310 fee. Happily for you though, things start going to plan when word gets round that the lemons your friend's using are actually mouldy and have been making people sick. Suddenly, the stock price of the stand goes through the floor (lets say they drop to 50p per share) and those \u00a3100 of shares you borrowed are now worth \u00a350. So, what you need to do now is buy 100 stocks (to return to the lender) but as the price has fallen, this only costs you \u00a350. That leaves you with holding 100 shares (which you'll return) and \u00a350 in your pocket. Granted, you'll have to pay the lender a tenner as a fee but at the end of the day you're \u00a340 the richer. Well done my little five year old! You've just taken your first step on risky-yet-potentially-profitable-ethical-questionable-tightrope!\n\nCredit - u/loudribs",

He hits that sweet spot between comedy and depressing, frustrating reality with a surgical strike and hasn't been able to replicate it quite the same way in his more recent offerings (though I did enjoy *Vice*).\n\nIt's the cast even more than the writing that does it for me. Bale and Carrell were fantastic, but they had big, juicy characters to rip into; who I found even more impressive were Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling and Jeremy Strong. Their roles were a bit smaller, comparatively, but they were played so damn believably. They really nailed three different Wall Street trader archetypes while still making them seem like actual people: the embittered veteran, the big bank finance bro and the no-nonsense shark.\n\nIt really lays out the rampant greed of the financial sector and the government's complicity (or willful ignorance) when it comes to regulation enforcement. Not to get too political, but major financial institutions pay big bucks to make sure conservative rhetoric pushes that unregulated free-market hokum. So many of the people who buy into that bullshit are the ones getting completely fucked when it comes to homeownership. Unfortunately they're not the only ones getting screwed; everybody is.\n\nUnderneath it all, the truly stranger-than-fiction part of it is the story of Dr. Michael Bury. The fact that someone like that exists\u2014with that foresight, that tenacity and those gargantuan balls\u2014is almost unbelievable.",

            "comment": "The banks were loaning money to irresponsible borrowers, the way the banks could finance it is by selling to the public \"collateralized debt\" bonds that were consisted of different risk mortgages.  \nHow it works? Let's say bank wants to loan out money, but it doesn't have any, so what does it do? They go to the public and offer a bond with let's say 3% annual prime, and they loan the money they received for the bond to home buyers for let's say 5% annual prime, and the bank pockets 2% difference as profit.  \nSo again... let's say I'm a bank. I go to a public and say \"give me 100 dollars, and I will pay you back each year 10 dollars and plus 3 dollars as a bonus for 10 years\", and then I take this 100 dollars and loan it out, and the borrower pays me back each year 10 dollars plus 5 dollars bonus. I pay each year 13 dollars back to the bond holder, and the remaining 2 dollars are mine. Meaning overall I would pay 130 dollars to bond holder, and receive 150 dollars from mortgage borrower, while making a net profit of 20 dollars after 10 years. Got it?  \nSo after a while what the banks did, they put in their bonds a different mix of risk mortgages, and the credit agencies didn't assess the risk correctly, giving those mixed bonds higher rate, prompting the public to believe that they are not as risky as they really were, which allowed banks to raise very large amount of money and push mortgages aggressively to people with very bad credit history.  \nEventually people took loans they couldn't pay, banks run out of money to pay to bond holders (because of the high mortgage default rates there was less money coming in than the amount needed to go out), the whole pyramid collapsed. That's why the Congress passed all kind of legislature making it harder to borrow money and having to make a sizeable down-payment, to make sure you are a reliable borrower.  \n\nTo \"short\" some kind of asset, it's a tricky thing. It means is that you believe that a certain asset is about to go down in value, and you try to make money from the drop. For example you are an investment company, and you take money from people to invest in all kind of stocks and bonds. Let's say a client calls you and tells you to invest 100 dollars in stock \"A\", you take his money and do it. After a while you become confident that the stock \"A\" is about to go down, so you sell it without telling your client. After a week the stock value drops to 90 dollars, your worried client calls you and tells you to sell, you say no problem and give him 90 dollars for his stock at its current market value, without telling him you already sold it for 100 a week ago, and pocket that 10 dollars. Of course this practice has many problems, and there are many questions about its legality, involving issues like conflict of interests and ethics and stuff like that.   \nAnd by the way, the way they shortened the collateralized debt bonds in real life, is by buying a lot of insurance for them from big companies like AIG, insurance that guarantees to pay if the bonds default, even if you don't hold any bonds. Like it was dumb for insurance companies to sell this kind of policies, but they did allow it, and when the bonds defaulted the insurance companies had to pay a lot of money and that's why some of them collapsed. \n\nBasically it's just one big pyramid that has collapsed, and at its core is the fact that a large amount of people had defaulted on their mortgages, and that had a chain effect on banks and insurance companies.",

            "comment": "Best summary of what happened.  \n\n-90s policy \u201ceveryone to own a home\u201d weakened restrictions on bank lending \n\n-banks started lending to anyone, Including a lot of \u201csub prime\u201d loans, aka low credit scores or high debt to income \n\n-all those loans were put into bonds, Wall Street invested a ton into housing bonds (still do, but more prime). \n\n-lots of people had ARM loans. Adjustable rate mortgages, they\u2019d buy a house for 3.5% for 2 years, then rate would jump to say 6%. Mortgage went up, lost house. \n\n-x1000\n\n-sub prime bonds collapsed, market tanked. \n\n-layoffs \n\n-more defaults and bankruptcies. \n\n\n-on a side note, Obama did do a good job saving the economy and kept it from getting much worse. And no, I don\u2019t care about your politics, objectively it was handled great. If you disagree cause politics a you\u2019re biased. \n\nFun facts, housing market was pretty rough till like 2015. Even at peak building in Covid, we were building 50%  less houses than in early 2000s. That\u2019s why we currently have a housing shortage, from the last decade. And housing bonds are strong. I could give more data but we\u2019re not really near a housing crash.",

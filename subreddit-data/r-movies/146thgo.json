Phil Knight, who founded Nike, gave funding to the studio when they were struggling, and eventually outright purchased it. \n\nI don\u2019t know the details of what happened between him and the original founder, Vinton, but the reality is that the company was doing poorly. When Vinton failed to get any other funding, he was fired.\n\nSo yeah, Nike money didn\u2019t MAKE the studio. But it did save it from collapse. Travis Knight was working there before his Dad took interest, so it\u2019s pretty likely Travis\u2019 involvement was the only reason his Dad had stepped in at all, as I\u2019m not aware of Phil Knight otherwise pursuing anything film related.\n\nAlso, look at their box office numbers. Missing Link was a massive bomb ($26M against a budget of $100M), and their other films generally haven\u2019t done that hot either (with the exception of Coraline, which just over doubled its budget - not exceptional, but a lot better than anything following it). A studio that regularly spends $60M+ per film, with extremely long production times, and sees little to no profit wouldn\u2019t be able to sustain itself. Missing Link probably would\u2019ve sank that company. This thing is a labour of love for Travis Knight, and his Dad can bankroll it a thousand times over without batting an eye.",

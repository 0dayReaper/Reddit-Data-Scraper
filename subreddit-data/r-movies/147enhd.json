Especially since it's already Walt Disney's 100th anniversary, and even then, it's trailing behind The Bad Guys, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, the Super Mario Bros. movie, and just recently, Across the Spider-Verse.\n\nLike, The Bad Guys gave us Diane Foxington as a hot piece of furbait similar to Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde.  Same thing for Porsha Crystal from Sing 2, as well as the Death Wolf from Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.  How are Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde from Zootopia supposed to compete with those, when Disney would downplay Zootopia at the worst possible time imaginable, that is its 100th anniversary?",

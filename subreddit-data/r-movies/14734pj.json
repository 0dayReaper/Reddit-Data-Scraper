I think she was given a raw deal. They just got married and they\u2019re what, 15 maybe 16 years old? Now they\u2019re given a baby to raise? What kind of parent would do that to their child? And yes, this is a joke.",

First of all, he's been told the asteroid is going to hit and wipe out new york, what the fuck else is he reading in the newspaper, actually what the fuck else is the newspaper printing. The fucking horoscope (pisces and aquarius: you will have a good day), or maybe garfield...\n\nAnd which maniac of a boss would think, you know what, today we'll print a newspaper, and get it delivered to all the stands in new york.\n\nHow many delivery drivers perished because this guy wanted his paper to read.\n\nSorry, i just had to vent.

I'm not sure I can think of a single one. Maybe Wall-E? Now maybe they're just being very coy with the marketing and I'm sure there is SOME kind of obstacle for them to overcome but this one feels very different in terms of content than the usual Pixar fare. And I'm sure this movie will make a ton of money, they always do. I would also be very interested to see the repeat viewings/profit margin of Pixar movies over time. Like I'm sure adults are taking their kids to go see this movie but is the profit margin declining? Are kids wanting to watch these movies again and again or is it one and done?\n\nEdit: I should also make it clear I'm not like anti-Pixar or anything. They've made incredible works of art with amazing consistency. This one is just really making me go 'huh?'.\n\nEdit 2: Whoa, here's an [interesting graphic](https://i.redd.it/9cm3egxkbta91.png). Hope that comes thru. Not that box office is the be all end all of judging a studio but that's a pretty dramatic shift!",

What's more of an adventure then embarking on a new relationship after decades of being off the market?",

The animation, art style and shot choices all work to make the film look absolutely incredible visually. The soundtrack by Giachinno is absolutely immaculate too. On top of that it's just a lot of fun too. That's all my opinion though, and everyone is entitled to their own.",

I read this was the final episode of the Disney Plus mini-series \"Dug Days\", but it was so good they decided to hold off and release it theatrically. Though, it it is suppose to be the final \"Up\" venture. I thought Dug Days was so-so, kind of wish they had one episode than took.place beyond Carl's backyard. Or even a Kevin cameo.\n\nElemental...why does this film look like Inside Out to me? Inside Out with a Zootopia framework. Elemental feels like like an AI program created it...tho it could be good. I'm still bummed Luca never came to theaters, my fave Pixar of the modern era.",

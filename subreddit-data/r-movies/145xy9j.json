It\u2019s really the big films that require you to have foreknowledge. Otherwise you can just follow one character\u2019s episodic movie adventures.\n\nIn that vein, it feels like people are largely unfair about \u201cif I watch X then I have to watch Y and Z!\u201d\n\nNo you don\u2019t.

For example, the Guardians of the Galaxy movie was a gamble for Disney because virtually all of the characters were nobodies. But James Gunn and the rest of the crew made it work and now Disney earns billions not just from the movies but also from the merchandise. The Groot toys and collectibles alone would probably fund a small country for a year. \n\nSo it doesn't matter if the studios make flop after flop. All they need is one win and they recoup all their losses and more.",

It succeeded because of the **genre** of these movies.\n\nIn 2006 the general public really didn't know any of the future MCU characters, except Hulk. Even comic fans considered the Avengers  a C-list property compared to the \"big 3\" of Superman, Batman and Spider-Man.\n\nThese movies succeeded because of **Robert Downey Jr.** and the new brand of improvisational, fast-bantering, action-comedy that he had previously pioneered on ***Kiss Kiss Bang Bang*** and ***Tropic Thunder***.\n\nThat \"Marvel Humor\" is tiring and annoying in 2023, but in 2008 it was a huge breath of fresh air.\n\nCulture always moves in cycles. The 80s and 90s were a heyday for action comedies like ***Back To The Future***, every Jackie Chan movie, ***Last Action Hero*** etc. \n\nThen after September 11, action and comedy became seriously estranged. People didn't want their heroes to quip while innocent lives were at stake. \n\nDuring the 2000s, action movies ran to grimdark espionage thrillers like ***The Bourne Identity***, ***Man on Fire***, ***Collateral***, and ***Taken***. Speaking of Taken this was also a golden age for revenge movies like ***Kill Bill Vol 2.***, ***Casino Royale + Quantum of Solace***, ***V for Vendetta***, ***The Prestige***, ***Law Abiding Citizen***....\n\nAt the same time, comedy movies were typically lowbrow grossout farces (Sometimes hiding behind the 'parody' label, but they were really all farces) like ***Wedding Crashers***, ***Anchorman***, ***Epic Movie***, ***The Hangover***, ***Dodgeball***,  or ***Idiocracy***. \n\nRDJ helped bring action and comedy back together at an opportune time. He was followed by other actors who have made mostly or entirely action-comedies in the 2010s, like Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson. \n\nThe result has been oversaturation again, and people getting tired of movies that puncture their own tension with 4th wall jokes and quips. That's a sign that the audience is ripe for someone to come along and discover the box office potential of reviving one of the more dormant genres.\n\nThat's what all these other \"mega franchise\" attempts are missing. They're not actually bringing anything new to the theaters. They're just trying to be \"more of the MCU\" but with different characters. We already have more than enough MCU. During the rare month where there isn't any MCU ***cOnTeNt*** coming out I can still go watch ***Bullet Train*** or ***Free Guy*** or ***Everything Everywhere All At Once*** or ***The Lost City of Z***.",

Even when he's equipping jokes, there's usually (depending on the scene) an immense amount of pain/sadness in his eyes.\n\n Imo it's why the early joke-quip style worked so well. They had actors who could tell a joke with layers of character development. Now it's just... Jokes for jokes sake. Yawn.",

It also showed the cultural aspects of them making it illegal to marry non magical folks compared to Britain was a nice touch of realism. \n\nToo bad, doesn't seem too blockbuster for warner brothers though.\n\nMaybe I'm just too boring to find magical bureaucracy super interesting and how to navigate it when trying to make a new profession.",

Apparently, they used Pizza Hut in the European cut because there weren\u2019t any Taco Bells there at the time. Strange that my local video rental place had the US cut. This was before there were any Blockbuster\u2019s in England. Rambling anecdote over.",

They\u2019re running out of fresh ideas, the writing is suffering, the storyline is diluted, and people are starting to dip out of installments.\n\nBecause it is so serialized, people feel the need to go back and watch the ones they skipped to follow the new ones they want to see. But then it becomes a chore and after a while, the unwatched installments pile up and it becomes overwhelming.\n\nCinematic universes have the potential to make a lot of money when they\u2019re good, and lose a shitload of money when they\u2019re not. I think that the MCU will continue to underperform in a significant way if they don\u2019t course correct or clear the slate in some manner.",

Yeah, technically the High Evolutionary kept destroying planets but he wasn't hunting down and attacking other planets to blow them up, he was just shaking his planetary Etch-A-Sketch as far as he was concerned. The main thrust of the story was about saving Rocket - a personal story about friends rescuing their buddy from the brink of death, and then Rocket getting his revenge on the people who tortured him and murdered his childhood friends. \n\nThe universe was not at stake, hell, they don't even attempt to prevent that one planet from being blown up (mainly because they didn't know he was planning to do that). The concern with saving lots of people was just rescuing the captives aboard his mothership, which is still, again, not a \"save the world\" level problem, which is great because I'm tired of those.",

            "comment": "I find this perception that \"blockbuster movies about toys and superheroes and monsters and stuff\" can't have crossovers or recurring characters kind of silly? Like so what if they do? Sounds like a fun idea.\n\nBut we keep getting these articles and think pieces saying they shouldn't do that, imo for two reasons. First, there's always there's always the implication that they are just copying Marvel. Okay, whatever. I don't really see a problem with taking a fun idea and copying it.\n\nSecond, and this is the big one... It keeps not working for anyone else. But is that because the idea is inherently flawed? No, I don't think so. Yes it's hard to get all the actors back all the time, but you can work around that. The real problem is that studios are awful at it. They are not hiring the talent necessary to keep people invested in the idea.\n\nUniversal wanted a CU. They hired some hacks who had never written a movie before to shit out Dracula Untold...like would it have killed you to hire some actually well regarded monster movie writer or thriller writer? It was so bad they just were like \"oops, that one doesn't count\" and tried again with The Mummy. For that one they hired actual talent...and then let Cruise screw around with the product on set. It was awful. Then Sony, they make Morbius, and who do they hire? *The same hacks that wrote Dracula Untold!*\n\nPeople are sick of the idea not because it's inherently bad, but because Studios are not taking the quality of the movies seriously and are churning out forgettable junk that won't get people's butts in the theater.",

Movie studios exist to make money. \n\nPut yourself in the shoes of a greedy CEO, do you spend $50 million making an original movie hoping to gain millions of fans, or do you spend $100 million making a movie that's already got millions of dedicated fans. \n\nThis is why we get remakes and cinematic universes. Corporations are not willing to risk spending money on unknown content. They're not out to make a cult classic, they're out to make a pop phenomenon.",

The mcu made a bunch of good movies before starting to seriously tie them together with the avengers. These other studios think they can do the avengers in one or 2 movies.",

    "postText": "I remember reading about Major League, the comedy baseball movie, that baseball players said for all its jokes and some liberties, it really nailed the locker room pre game, especially for important games. They said that the serious, kind of quiet atmosphere was very accurate. \n\nWhat other comedy movies (as I imagine this is more common, but any movie is fine) , whether intentionally or accidentally, got their source material correct or revealed a part of it that most might not know?",

    "postText": "A movie can be great in many ways, from its ingenuity in handling an issue, its brilliantly written characters, the outstanding direction, the great performances by the actors, etc. But There is another important factor that is very important to me and which influences my opinion of the film for many reasons ; it should be ENTERTAINING. \n\nI want everyone to tell us the most Entertaining movie he's ever seen and preferably be emotionally attached to it. This is a great mix that is hard to find.\n\nWait for your answers!",

It's a horror/action/comedy with smart, capable people, smart, capable monsters and if you've never seen it before you'll be trying to figure out what to do right along with the townsfolk.",

You can watch it 20 times and there still won't be boring moments.\n\nI was going to answer either Fury Road, Snatch or one of several Tarantino movies.",

Ferrari was a recent favorite of mine), there's not that many hockey movies made in general (Mighty Ducks doesn't hit the same; Goon was a fun new one), and Miracle is just super solid in my opinion. Nothing flashy, nothing that's going to blow your mind, but it's just good filmmaking with a pretty exceptional underdog story.",

Hookers, cocaine, invisible Val Kilmer Elvis.  \n\nYou've got an early Tarantino screenplay directed by Tony Scott with an unbelievable cast, great scenes, solid score...it is exciting, dramatic, tense, funny, heartwarming, violent, sexy, and a damn good time.  It's basically an edgier Princess Bride.",

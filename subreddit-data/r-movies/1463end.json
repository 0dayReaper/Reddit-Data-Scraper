    "postText": "It was such a great movie when it came out, had some really intresting, and even some very scary scenes at the time.  I remember it being marketed as some lighthearted comedy about somebody running for office, but it ended up being way different then I ever thought it was going to be.  Jack Black was in an early role, John Cusack made a camo appearence, and the late Fred Ward played a local news anchor.  But now, this movie seems like it has vanished from all areas, to the point, in which it no longer really seems to be avalable.  What happened, to cause this movie to fade away in this way, so that you cannot find it on You Tube, or any other streaming service, or really even video stores?",

At a Blockbuster or Movie Gallery/Hollywood Video... maybe. Those corporate chains always had some shelves with older movies, but it was like they were picked out of a hat. You could be in one that had Spike Lee's 'Clockers' but no 'Do the Right Thing'. It was weird.\n\nI can confirm that at my stores, we had Bob Roberts on VHS tape. Not sure if we had the DVD.",

    "postText": "First things first I truly believe this is an example of a script and movie only about 4 or 5 actors could do justice to. You need someone with Will Smith's range and charisma who could elevate this movie past the by the numbers formula. The scenes where he's with his son and they're homeless are heartbreaking and Smith's ability to show how ashamed he is just by his facial features is outstanding. And then you have the ending which is one of the most emotionally please endings ever imo.",

    "postText": "TL;DR - What wonderful or amazing films sort of defied convention or expectation by doing so much more with a really limited budget?\n\n\\---------------------------\n\nI don't want to steal the thunder, but the film Primer is unreal as an example. A purported budget of $7000 to deliver what they delivered, possibly one of the greatest time travel films ever made?\n\nAnd Deadpool was famous with figuring out how to make more with less, and Tim Miller's VFX skills were unreal helpful.\n\nBut I think it's Everything Everywhere All at Once that blew my mind. For example, they shot the time travel scenes, essentially, by walking around New York and using Iphones. Unreal.\n\n&gt;For instance, for when Yeoh's character is flying between dimensions, they decided to shoot their own B-roll in New York. They used a camera with an open shutter speed and angle to make everything blurry, then walked around the city. They cut together that footage and had Michelle act in slow motion while it played on LED screens beside her. Wrapping around the whole thing was a green screen they used to layer in other effects and some of the footage to make her flying complete. Then they sped the whole thing up. [https://nofilmschool.com/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-visual-effects](https://nofilmschool.com/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-visual-effects)\n\nSO, what wonderful or amazing films sort of defied convention or expectation by doing so much more with a really limited budget?\n\nedit: wanted to make sure to add quote blocks.",

Industry vets were impressed enough at his self-sufficient organization and work schedule, the film eventually landed Edwards Godzilla AND a Star Wars film.",

They weren\u2019t working with shoestrings. That was a creative choice, but not one for any other real reason than for fun and quirkiness. Nothing to do with budget restrictions at all on that front",

Optimus and the Transformers feel like full characters more than any other movie, besides maybe Bumblebee. Optimus actually has an arc that parallels to a human's, Mirage has a clear relationship with Noah (that reminds me of the cartoons in a good way), Primal doesn't have tons of screentime but has a lot of expressiveness when he does...it was great to see that\n2. The movie has beats that are cliche af, but it is never cynical or too cool or embarrassed which I appreciate. It just follows tried and true formulas to get you to what you came for, which is the action and adventure\n\nFar from perfect but a lot of fun, I hope people give this more light-hearted approach a chance and we get to see it expand, I think it has a lot of potential.",

Every now and then I still think back to \u201cBe careful, that\u2019s the watch that killed Hitler\u201d and Bumblebee in WWII shooting up Nazis. \n\nThere was nothing like that here. The robot storyline wasn\u2019t as good as the 2007 movie or as insane as TLK, and the humans weren\u2019t as memorable as Sam Witwicky or Charlie Watson from Bumblebee. This really felt like a very safe Transformers movie",

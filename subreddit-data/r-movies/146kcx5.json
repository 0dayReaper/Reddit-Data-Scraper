But it was mainly the 3D that caused huge word of mouth and people had to see it in the cinema.\n\nThe second one obviously had the expectations from the first film, there's not really been any good 3D films since the first avatar, technology moved on since then too so people were obviously intrigued to see what Cameron came up with. It was again another solid film with good 3d, an experience you can only really achieve in cinema.",

On top of that, it was Hollywood juggernaut James Camerons's return to the big screen after 12 years.\n\nAvatar 2's hype was far more lukewarm, but I think it still seemed like an 'original concept', compared to the endless Disney remakes and MCU/DCEU films that were based on well known properties. Original material is getting pretty rare these days, but Avatar had been out of the spotlight for so long that it didn't feel like a world that has been over-saturated from existing content.\n\nI am surprised the sequel was so profitable, because I didn't know many people personally who were keen to see it. I went in with tempered expectations - it'll be fine craftsmanship on a simple story - but I didn't feel like revisiting the film in a cinema like I did with the first film.",

            "comment": "The success of the first film isn't a fluke. It was from James Cameron whose previous film was Titanic. It was marketed as an unmissable experience. And the word of mouth was that it was actually pretty good. Sure people made fun of its derivative story but it's not just about the story it's also about how it's told and the breathtaking visuals are an important part of that. The basic story allows everyone to connect with it. \n\nPeople often criticize simple derivative stories and broad characters but they tend to resonate with the most number of people. These movies are also really well made. James Cameron understands the importance of letting people experience the world. In both movies there are extended sequences where you're just flying or swimming, taking in the sights. He's not just barreling towards a climax we already know. It's the journey.\n\nThese movies are labors of love. Cameron definitely cares about the world, the characters, even the technology and a lot of that sincerity and heart shines through. His action sequences are visually coherent. He doesn't get overwhelmed by CGI even when he's making an entirely animated film. \n\nThe second film is following up on the success of the previous one. Even if it didn't have the perpetual hype machine of a cinematic universe most people who saw the first film remembered the experience. It was also marketed well. On the internet it might not have seemed so but \nsocial media tends to give a skewed perspective on reality. And when it came out the second film turned out to be really good too.\n\nOf course, good is subjective. Not everyone thinks these movies are good. That's okay. But they clearly worked for a huge number of people. \n\nThere's also inflation so the second film probably didn't sell anywhere near as many tickets as the first one.",

            "comment": "Bruh I liked them whatchu mean. I\u2019d go see a third in a heartbeat. Allow me to elaborate: the plot was actively getting in the way the entire time. The visual effects really were *that* good. The middle hour that was just swimming with space whales was one of my favorite parts of any movie I\u2019ve seen in a few years. It was soup for the soul, absolutely gorgeous. It was a shame there was a plot surrounding that middle hour and worse yet that it was actively detrimental since I saw the first one. Jake is actually a bad person. I hope the third one fixes him, he was a bad father and he protected the forest tribe that would\u2019ve died to protect his family after the first movie\u2026to put a bunch of strangers in danger. Once again, though\u2026it\u2019s pretty. The third one will be, as well. That will be enough",

Otherwise I would forget it ever existed. It's totally forgettable. And in my opinion it's a shit story with shit graphics and a shit... It's just a shit movie overall. I think we just have to stop conflating quality with money making. It's not that. I think just being forgettably generic enough to appeal to 7 billion people's curiosity... alone is enough to make a billion dollars in this world.",

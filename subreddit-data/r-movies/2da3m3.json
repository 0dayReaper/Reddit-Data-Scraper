            "comment": "Just wanted to pop into the thread with a small Robin Williams remembrance.  I worked on the film \"Death to Smoochy\" as a lowly PA, and I had never before and have never since seen someone on set like Robin Williams.  He never turned off.  After DeVito yelled \"cut\" Robin Williams would still go with his manic improv.  It was a lot of fun being on that set on days when Robin Williams was shooting.  He had a non-stop engine/drive to entertain.  Really fun stuff.\n\nWe were filming in Times Square the day of Super Bowl XXXV (when the Ravens killed my G-men), and after we wrapped for the day, the production had rented a floor of ESPN Sportszone, and the whole cast &amp; crew went over there to watch the game.  \n\nOf course, the crew had started a pool for the game, and everyone bought a box or two - actors included.  DeVito won the first quarter.  Edward Norton had the halftime box.  And (if I remember correctly) Robin Williams won both the 3rd quarter and final score (I think the score had the same last digits at end of 3rd and end of game, right?).\n\nOf course, we lowly crew shrugged our shoulders when the multi-millionaire actors won every.single.box.  \n\nBut to Robin Williams credit, he took the money from that and then some and bought the crew gifts at wrap.  It wasn't much.....just a stupid \"Death to Smoochy\" hat, but it was a nice gesture.  I've heard stories of actors buying the entire crew gifts before, but - other than this example - I had never seen it once in the 5 years I spent working in film production.\n\nAnyway, I felt like sharing this somewhere, so I thought I'd leave it here. I will forever remember Robin Williams energy both when the cameras were rolling but especially when they weren't, and I will always remember his generosity to the crew.\n\n\nSide story - a couple years later I was working on another film, and we were shooting in Central Park.  Who rides by on his racing bike in full biker gear - hat, racing glasses, skin tight pants, etc. - than Robin Williams.  He hops off the bike and says hello to some of the cast members and the director, and he was still the same exact guy he was a few years earlier.  Just so funny to see him in spandex and tinted sunglasses running around a set doing his improv.  ",

The dialogue for anyone that doesn't remember:\n\n&gt; [reading a letter on T.V.] \"Dear Mrs. Doubtfire; Two months ago, my mom and dad decided to separate. Now they live in different houses. My brother Andrew says that we aren't a real family any more. Is this true? Did I lose my family? Is there anything I could do to get my parents back together? Sincerely, Katie McCormick.\" Oh, my dear Katie. You know, some parents get along much better when they don't live together. They don't fight all the time and they can become better people. Much better mommies and daddies for you. And sometimes they get back together. And sometimes they don't, dear. And if they don't... don't blame yourself. Just because they don't love each other doesn't mean that they don't love you. There are all sorts of different families, Katie. Some families have one mommy, some families have one daddy, or two families. Some children live with their uncle or aunt. Some live with their grandparents, and some children live with foster parents. Some live in separate homes and neighborhoods, in different areas of the country. They may not see each other for days, weeks, months or even years at a time. But if there's love, dear, those are the ties that bind. And you'll have a family in your heart forever. All my love to you, poppet. You're going to be all right. Bye-bye.",

He was upset his character was hurting hers. She said he was just such a warm and caring person that he had a hard time with the scene. He was protective of his Mindy to this day. \n\nedit: I highly recommend watching season 1 of mork and mindy on youtube. other than his show-stealing performance on happy days as mork, he was unknown at that time. he instantly elevated everyone associated with mork and mindy to stardom. I have never seen another actor do the same. From his first appearance he was clearly something different.",

He then looked over to me and asked:\n\n\"So. What's good?\"\n\nI was pretty certain who the man in the hoodie was right off the bat. Being a Torontonian, I used every ounce of my resolve to be cool, and asked him what kind of game he was looking for.\n\nHe smiled and said \"I'm trying to find something my son and I can play. Maybe something we can play together since I'm not home often.\"\n\nI nodded and reached for a copy of Warcraft.  \n\n\"I think he might enjoy this, Mr. Williams.\" \n\nFor a man who I knew to be frenetic, his quiet acknowledgement and soft smile was extremely disarming. \n\nAnd so that's my memory of him. Not a comedy genius. Not as a frantic addict. Not as Mork or any of the myriad of other roles he played.\n\nMy memory of him is one of a father hoping to connect with son.\n\nRest well, Mr. Williams.\n\nI look forward to fighting alongside you in Skeleton Hell.\n \nEd: a keen eyed redditor corrected me. It was Warcraft and not Starcraft. Also: thanks for the gold!\n",

There's an unfortunate social stigma that you're wrong or should feel ashamed for having mental health issues, but please dont be too scared to seek help if you are having problems. http://www.mentalhealth.gov/get-help/",

But he absolutely nailed it.  It wasn't all drama, but he was better than anyone had expected.\n\nAnd then came \"Dead Poets Society.\"  And then a very serious turn on \"Homicide.\"  \n\nAnd then Good Will Hunting came along, and he cemented himself as one of the most diverse and talented actors ever on film.  Comedy, improv, drama, light, heavy, weird, straight.  Yeah, he did some stinkers, but bad Robin Williams was still always better than most stuff.\n\nThis is a very big loss loss.

Being sophomore college students, we could only afford nosebleed seats for his show here in Minnesota at the historic Northrup Auditorium on campus.  As Robin is/was one of my favorite comedians and actors, we arrived early and sat in our seats primed with excitement for the show. While we were sitting alone up on the second tier balcony (as we were an hour-plus early), a woman came up and asked us if we were big Robin William fans. \"Of course!\" we both replied, listing off all our favorite shows (Aladdin, Hook, etc.) he was in and apart of when we were kids.  Turns our Robin bought a couple tickets in the front row for loyal fans who could only afford nosebleeds. It was probably the most amazing thing that has ever happened in my life.  Rest in peace, Robin. \n\n[Photo I took of my view that night prior to his performance](http://i.imgur.com/1jEuEwZ.jpg)",

No criticism of those who loved him intended, but what keeps this ugly pit in my stomach is the knowledge that everyone who takes their own life does so bitterly, horribly alone. The thought that this very morning, around the time I was commenting on how fucking beautiful the weather was, Williams was succumbing to whatever demons were chasing him, and he felt there was no one who could help him.\n\nThere *were*, just as he himself had been there to help others, like Christopher Reeve, through the darkness. He had friends, family... but his sickness blinded him to that, and this morning he was just taken with the kind of despair that no person, least of whom someone as beloved, gifted and inspirational as Robin Williams, should have to feel.\n\nI hate that Robin Williams is dead. But that knot in my stomach, that won't let me take in food, is for what he must have been feeling during those last hours this morning. He felt it, and now we'll never have him back.\n\nGod damn it.\n",

He uplifted the world around him, which even some of the most famous of celebrities don't always do.\n\nCheesy though he was, he was a reminder of something better. And again, he was only 63.

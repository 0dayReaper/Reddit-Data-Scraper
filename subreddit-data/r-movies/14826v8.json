    "postText": "So I've not long just finished watching 'her' (2013), absolutely outstanding film in so many ways. The cinematography, the music, the direction, the performances from Joaquin and Scarlett especially.\n\nAnd despite how emotional it gets towards the end when Samantha leaves Theodore, I find it to be quite a happy ending overall. Theodore learns to appreciate the world around him, to take in the beauty of the world with Amy, and to apologise to and appreciate everything Catherine was and is to him.\n\nI find myself deep in thought after watching that film even now, and more importantly I just feel good after watching it. Good because it's a fantastic film, yeah. But also good because, like Theodore and Samantha, I feel like in this moment, I'm taking in the world around me, the people and the experiences and the emotions and the beauty, and just appreciating them all. And it got me thinking more about how important film is in making you feel that way. It's crucial in some ways, it helps you to put a word to the thing you're feeling, it makes your emotions solid and palpable and clear.\n\nThey make you feel truly alive.\n\nThese feelings of focused joy don't usually last more than a few days, but it's nice to acknowledge these sensations and to take the best from them: movies are so so amazing, and from there they help you find the amazing parts of life.\n\nDo any of you get what I'm saying? And do you have other films like 'her' that make you feel that way? I find films like 'The Green Mile' (John Coffey in particular), 'Everything Everywhere All At Once' (Waymond Wang, absolute gem), 'Groundhog Day' (the homeless man subplot always gets me) are all good examples of that feeling of awakened clarity in my opinion.\n\nLemme know, I'm eager to hear!",

            "comment": "I also recently rewatched Her. Well, I walked in on my sister watching it and caught like, the last half. I just love how it could've gone the delusional \"Lars and the real girl\" sort of route and been a fine movie, but instead it addresses the concept of \"real\" love and then moves onto a more philosophical point. Beautiful.\n\nI remember the day after my (terrible) high school prom, I stayed in bed and watched Clerks, then The Big Lebowski back to back. The former was good but I really just fell in love with The Big Lebowski. There was this sort of freeing feeling, like I was done with all the bullshit of being in high school and I could finally move on with my life. \n\nThere was something about the movie that just helped me feel that way. Like I didn't have to take everything so seriously.  I really felt amazing that day.",

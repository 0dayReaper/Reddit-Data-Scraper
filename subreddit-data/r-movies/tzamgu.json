For this, we are sorry. This was an opportunity for us to set an example for our guests, viewers and our Academy family around the world, and we fell short \u2014 unprepared for the unprecedented.  \n\n&gt;Today, the Board of Governors convened a meeting to discuss how best to respond to Will Smith\u2019s actions at the Oscars, in addition to accepting his resignation. The Board has decided, for a period of 10 years from April 8, 2022, Mr. Smith shall not be permitted to attend any Academy events or programs, in person or virtually, including but not limited to the Academy Awards.\n \n&gt;We want to express our deep gratitude to Mr. Rock for maintaining his composure under extraordinary circumstances. We also want to thank our hosts, nominees, presenters and winners for their poise and grace during our telecast.\n\n&gt;This action we are taking today in response to Will Smith\u2019s behavior is a step toward a larger goal of protecting the safety of our performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy. We also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted.\n\n&gt;Thank you,\n\n&gt;David Rubin and Dawn Hudson",

Because Rock's poise stat is enormous he was able to take the hit and continue on like nothing had happened, both mentally and physically.\n\nImagine if Rock didn't have that much poise. Imagine if he had fallen over backwards and hit the back of his head on the stage. Or if Rock took the physical hit okay, but the assault shook him up so much he couldn't continue the presentation and walked off the stage abruptly. A performer being physically assaulted by someone in the audience has every right to immediately cancel the performance, and continuing with that mental interruption is a herculean effort.\n\nIf that happened the assault could not have been ignored. Smith would have likely ended up in handcuffs.\n\nChris Rock needs to get more credit for being able to mentally continue the show after the assault. That he was able to remember the script and continue on anyways is amazing. The man is made of some tough stuff.",

That's just an insane reaction.\n\nThat's why even though the standing ovation in hindsight was super gross, I also wouldn't necessarily put it past people to just be really fucking confused. We've had almost two weeks to talk about the slap, the Oscars had about half an hour.",

It's like, if you were driving drunk and listening to a favorite band or album or whatever, and then get pulled over and thrown in jail for a DUI, from then on, that band or album will forever be associated with a really shitty night in your life (assuming you were with it enough to remember the events leading up to that arrest).",

Well, the rain made braking worthless. I ended up slamming my front drivers side into the rear passenger side. The back tires had big steel bars protecting them. That bar ripped all the way through the front block of my tiny Mazda and was about a foot from ripping into my side of the cab. Turns out there were no airbags, and I slammed my chest against the steering wheel so hard that it warped the column. I was able to make my chest pop until a couple years ago. My right arm was shredded with glass, and I ended up having small pieces work their way up through the skin for years later. I was able to get out of my vehicle and go sit on the ground in shock til the ambulance came, just cradling my arm while some bystanders brought up a roll of toilet paper and wrapped it(lmfao? I appreciate the attempt, they were probably in shock too and don\u2019t know how to help.)\n\nMy passenger had some soreness. That\u2019s it. So I guess jerking the wheel worked.\n\nIt\u2019ll be 9 years ago this month.",

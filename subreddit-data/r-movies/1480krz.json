    "postText": "It's magnificent. Another film that showed me why Spielberg was, is and will always be my favourite director. Also, let's talk about David Lynch being cast as John Ford, lol. Just epic. One of the greatest filmmakers acting as one of the greatest filmmakers in a film made by one of the greatest filmmakers!\nAnd don't get me started about the last scene. Spielberg re-adjusting the camera so that the horizon is at the bottom. Funny and brilliant at the same time \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4c what an experience!",

Or imagining filming the break up of his parents.  Framing his bully like a superhero.  \n\nIt also adds context to a lot of his movies.  \n\nThe first part of his life he thought it was his dad who left and broke up the family. \n\nSo when he wrote Close Encounters the main character goes crazy and abandons his family. \n\nThen later when he learned the whole story he wrote AI, where the mother drives her son into the middle of nowhere and abandons him forever.",

I thought Michelle Williams was really good.\n\n*And yeah, those last moments with Lynch and that camera adjustment are just killer.",

I liked it very much as it provided a lot of biographical context for the man. He is talented and he has contributed so much to not just movies but television and miniseries as well.",

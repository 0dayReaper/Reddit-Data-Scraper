Bam, named after a place.\n\nFun fact bonus: Columbus's hot neighbor who tried to eat him isn't named, she's just called 2E (or whatever it was), so she's also named after a place.",

I totally forgot about that, that was a sequel that lived up to the original, if not surpassing it.\n\nI don't know about other people, but I like Zombieland because it's different and original. I don't want the sequel to just retread old ground. I want to see something new that stands out from anything else, and repeating the same old gags from the original wouldn't really work in the same way the almost 4th wall breaking 22 Jump Street did. That movie worked because not only was it a sequel whose story was the same as the original, but it was also based on a TV show of the same premise. All that adds to the humor of it. It's a lot different than a sequel to an original movie just doing the same jokes again. \n\nI wouldn't be opposed to it, but it would be pretty hard to do. 22 Jump Street managed to pull it off but there a plenty of similar movies that failed. \n\nAt the end of the day, I don't care what they do as long as it's funny. And repeating a single joke isn't gonna make or break the movie, it would just be kinda predictable.  ",

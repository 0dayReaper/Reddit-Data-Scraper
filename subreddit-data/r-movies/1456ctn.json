By this, I mean films that always had a reputation of some sort. Most of them are definitely just straight up disturbing movies, but I wanna head for some outside-the-box picks as well. I have the basics for the list (Sal\u00f2, Antichrist, Come and See, Audition, etc.) but I want to know what films you\u2019ve all seen or sought out for their reputation, and what you\u2019ve thought of them! Even if it\u2019s any of those I mentioned. Thanks! (Tagged NSFW just in case?",

I wanted to watch more of Clive Owen after seeing him in ACS: Impeachment.\n\nHis Wikipedia page said this was his breakthrough role and one that won him critical acclaim. Also, Alan Rickman was in it and I think he's great so therefore I gave it a go despite it being a controversial film.\n\nI loved the film and it ended up being one of my favourites. \n\nIt's very complex and thought provoking. Nothing is spelled out and with each watch I'm changing my opinion on the characters, their decisions and why everything ended up they way it did. And I want to re-watch it as I want to understand everything and get my head around it.\n\nIt features gorgeous settings and has beautiful cinematography. It's the most visually stunning movie I have seen.",

LOVE has the notorious 3D cumshot directly into camera. Similarly you could list movies like Don't Look Now due to the controversies over whether or not the sex scenes were simulated. I think Y Tu Mama Tambien had unstimulated ones also. The Brown Bunny has a nasty reputation, as it should.",

They retain most of their intellect, can use weapons, and don't respond normally to pain(they either like or ignore it). They'll attack anyone who's not infected and do the sickest things they can imagine. It's theorized in the film that the infected cry because they know what they're doing but are helpless to stop. They'll kill, torture and rape on instinct and enjoy doing so. Making matters worse, the virus seems to spread like the flu and can overcome certain hosts within moments.",

But I will mention one other. \n\nA film called Mondo Toppless 1966. It's just girls with huge breats dancing around while talking about them selves. Their bodies and the way they are viewed by men, the way their bodies and their tits make them feel on a personal level. After half an hour - it doesn't even feel wierd to be watching it because Russ Meyer managed to normalise it so well.",

            "comment": "I enjoy shock horror movies, and have seen most of the infamous ones, but I've never watched Slaughtered Vomit Dolls and don't plan to. So I guess that one, since I won't even watch it. It's actually only the first film of the Vomit Gore trilogy.\n\nMen Behind the Sun is pretty brutal. It's a Chinese exploitation film based on the Japanese war crimes at Unit 731. What makes it more disturbing is that all the gruesome stuff in the movie actually happened. It's also rumored that an actual child's corpse was used in one scene. And the director has never denied it, despite publicly denying rumors about other scenes.\n\nTokyo Gore Police is a classic. The violence is so over the top that it becomes comedic, but it's still tough to watch sometimes. \n\nIrreversible has a literal 10 minute long rape scene, with no cuts, just a single shot of a guy brutally raping a woman in an alley. It later has a particularly violent shot of a man's face being caved in with a fire extinguisher. \n\nI find Salo especially disturbing because some of the actors look very young, and I don't know what the laws were regarding young actors in 1970's Italy lol. On this same note, Taxi Driver is pretty fucked up with 14 year old Jodie Foster.\n\nBegotten is an interesting black and white experimental film with no dialogue and some pretty disturbing imagery. It's on youtube. \n\nCannibal Holocaust is maybe the most infamous shock horror movie. There are actual animal deaths on screen. It also invented the found footage genre. And the director was initially arrested when it released, because rumors circulated that it was a snuff film. It's a genuinely good movie as well, which is somewhat rare with shock movies outside of French Extremism. \n\nAnd I wanna give a shout out to Mother! for having some crazy ass shit in it but tricking normies into the theater thinking it's the latest JLaw blockbuster.",

You\u2019re on a Spice Crawler with the man your Harkonnen man could smell like. What\u2019s in your hand? Back at me. I have it, it\u2019s an kris knife with two tickets to that thing you love. Look again, the tickets are now water. Anything is possible when your man smells like Old Spice Sand and not a lady. I\u2019m on a Sandworm.\"",

The sci-fi miniseries handled it correctly as basically a bridge between Dune and Children of Dune.

Though hopefully they won't pad it with the horrible content from the hack \"in-betweenquels\" that his son and Kevin J Anderson wrote. I'm already concerned seeing KJA in the credits of the first Dune movie as a consultant.",

I think it's been secretly greenlit for a while based on buzz, but they wanted to use the \"help get Part 2 made\" narrative to get bums on seats and drive ticket sales and viewing numbers on HBO Max.\n\nI just wish they'd been brave enough to go with it from the get-go and filmed the two back to back. Then we could have had Part 2 coming next year.",

I was just thinking of how cool it was to see that almost everybody exclusively uses melee weapons for combat because it seemed that their shielding technology made guns obsolete.\n\nWhich is just fucking awesome to me. I love the idea of futuristic meets medieval and having a good explanation as to why.",

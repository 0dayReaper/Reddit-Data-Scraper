    "postText": "Just caught Wild at Heart (1990) dir by David Lynch with Nic Cage, Laura Dern and Willem Dafoe at a local theater on a whim. Holy shit? One of the most fun theater experiences I've had! So campy. So quotable. The theater clapped at the end and it was well deserved. \n\nSurely the good r/movies people of Reddit can attest to its greatness?",

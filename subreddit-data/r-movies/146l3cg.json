    "postText": "Me personally, the worst movie I\u2019ve ever seen is probably dragon evolution. The movie is completely dog shit , but I did like some of the outfits . Goku\u2019s and Master Roshi\u2019s was surprisingly kinda accurate and well made . Plus I like the actor and actress who play Goku and bulma . Another example is the last air bender . Shitty movie , but I do really like Aangs arrow design and the final battle at the end where Aang destroys the ships with the huge wave. Really the only good scene in that movie, the music helped that scene a lot too",

Love to rewatch every now &amp; then\n\n\nI tried watching some similar movies but none of them Couldn't quite scratch the same feel.\n\nBlade series is pretty similar to it which i liked.\n\nMainly looking for japanese ones because their humor works with this kind of movies.\n\n\nU can recommend  Animated movies or anime  if u want",

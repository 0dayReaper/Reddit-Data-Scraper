Why should Russia the invading country have impunity to do whatever they want and Ukraine has to be the side that is diplomatic?  The Russians have shown time and time again that they will lie so all a diplomatic solution will do is delay the next time they invade.",

If Ukraine can win this war without diplomacy, I want to hear your views.     \n\nSo what's your solution, how do you see this ending without diplomacy and also without a nuclear war?    \n\nBecause diplomacy and treaties are how wars end.    \n\nRussia won't be invaded and destroyed by NATO, because that'll be the beginning of a nuclear war.   \n\nTo even think about \"winning\" (which would necessitate NATO membership to enjoy any kind of security), Ukraine will have to drive Russia completely out of Ukraine, including Crimea. Which already stretches the limits of plausibility to imagine they can take and hold that territory against a superior foe forever.    \n\nBut as long as Russia maintains a salient in Ukranian territory, NATO membership is off the table. The act of joining would be an act of war.    \n\nAnd even then if they do drive Russia out, by your own admission, Russia won't stop. So they'll be locked in low-level conflict in perpetuity, through constant border struggles that soak up resources and cause morale-sapping casualties. And recent history says Russia will just invade again later on.      \n\nIn all likelihood in this long timeframe, the expense of supporting Ukraine will be wearing on the NATO economies, and the political headwinds will change - a Republican win in 2024, for example, would have significant implications in that support. And without significant foreign support, Ukraine faces certain defeat.   \n\nI don't see a way for this to end that *doesn't* end in a negotiated peace where Ukraine is the \"loser\" of the exchange and cedes territory to Russia in exchange for a peace. Which is an enormous improvement over the situation in 2022, where Russia's aim was to destroy the Ukranian state apparatus and install a Russia-friendly puppet.    \n\nThe realities just are what they are, no matter how ethically obscene Russia's behaviour is.",

Reflect on that. \n\nAs to the nuclear problem overall - again, your \"pacifism\" here is not helpful. Nuclear blackmail should be met with refusal and force, always. This is actually an approach that ensures LOWER chance of a nuclear conflict. If west gives in to russian nuclear threats once - russia will push further and threaten again. And again. And again. At some point you have to stop appeasing and refuse - and at that point nuclear war is more likely than if you refuse right at the start. \n\nYou pacifism isn't seen as helping evil crazy dictator putin. IT IS helping crazy dictator putin. \n\nI am all for peace, where it's viable. But what you propose isn't peace. It's a quiet genocide. But you will be happy, of course, because it won't be called war and therefore you can pat yourself on a back. Without caring that more people will die in Ukraine than in an actual war.",

If you frequent combat footage subs, it seems every Ukrainian platoon in combat has at least one guy with a gopro filming the action. If it's a successful operation, the video makes it to telegram, and soon after reddit and the rest of the internet. This movie is coming out while the war is still raging. Russia is trying to do similar things. Both sides are certainly trying to plaster social media with videos of their success, in an effort to sway public opinion of the war.",

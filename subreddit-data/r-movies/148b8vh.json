    "postText": "Hey everyone, I was doing some research for a workshop I'm giving about sound in film and wanted to provide some examples of films that use sound (whether its on set or sound effects) on a black screen, before any images are shown. I have some examples among which:\n\nZero Dark Thirty\nFlorida Project\n\nI'm looking for more examples, the idea is to show how sound can take the lead on images and help tell a story from a different angle. Does any of you have any tips?",

The combination of ambient sounds, overlapping dialogue, and a distant drum score creates a sense of chaos and immediacy, drawing the audience into the story from the very beginning.",

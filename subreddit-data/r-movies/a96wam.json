What\u2019s worse is that nothing has changed, everyone is still a prisoner to the screens surrounding them, with no idea what the real world looks like outside of the shitty video games and simulations they\u2019re forced to interact with. The only exception is that now our \u201cprotagonist\u201d is seen as the leader of a revolution that will never come.\n\nLike how we always expect things to change because of the voices of a select few say they will, but nothing ever does change because many will never have the motivation to get off their ass and fight for a change.

A choose-your-own-adventure movie is just a sequence of video chapters that end in a menu leading to the next available video chapters.

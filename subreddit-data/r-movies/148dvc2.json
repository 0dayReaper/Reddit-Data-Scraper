Before 2018 it was really the TV shows that everyone praised Netflix for. I don't even really know what movies early Netflix had; they were just so early that they managed to have everything made within the last 50 years licensed to them at one point. \n\nOrange is the New Black, Breaking Bad, House of Cards, Bojack Horseman, Unbreakable, Black Mirror, hell even stuff like Narcos and Stranger Things almost fit in a 2010-2016 timeframe. When people think about how great early Netflix was I'd almost be willing to put money up that they'd mention at least two of those shows.",

People here started turning on Netflix when they started raising prices and cancelling niche shows. They started rooting against them in the Oscars and claiming people would leave and pirate. This ramped up when they started cracking down on password sharing. People acted like that would lead to dropped subs. The opposite proved to be true. The general public still enjoys Netflix. The quality hasn\u2019t dropped really. They\u2019ve always had critically acclaimed movies and mediocre to garbage content since they started doing their own stuff.",

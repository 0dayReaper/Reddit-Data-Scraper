From absolutely nailing it as an Australian serial killer in the true story 'The Stranger' to being a random adviser to a King in the King. This guy is amazing.   \n\n\nSean Harris is my favourite actor right now, and it's a pleasure to live on the same plane as that master. ",

What is great is that he seems to be immune to typecasting as only a villainous character. \n\nI feel like his career is probably only just getting started on its upwards trajectory and that is a great joy for me",

He is a true character actor, his best roles are ones where he is able to fully explore the complexity of the character.   \n\n\nCheck out the Stranger and you'll know what I mean. He is playing a truly dispicable disgusting human being, but throughout the movie he displays them in a realistic way, as somebody who is as complex as anyone else and shows you why in reality people like that are so dangerous. Because in reality, evil people don't always seem so evil. Which is something all of his best roles are able to convey.   \n\n\nIn MI:Fallout I imagine (haven't seen it) he's just playing generic bad guy, and it wouldn't really suit IMO.",

            "comment": "OK, so this might get lost in the deluge of replies but I want to tell a story about my personal experience(s) with Carrie Fisher.  See, when I was living in LA and working at the Tower Records on Sunset Blvd. she was a semi-regular customer. She was always very nice and easy-going. No celebrity attitude or ego. I maintained a professional and courteous demeanor even though my inner-ten year old was geeking out knowing I was helping Princess Leia find a copy of 'My Dinner With Andre' or some other obscure art-house movie. \n\nSo one day a fellow employee and I were taking a quick smoke-break outside and Ms. Fisher happened to be inside. He was having a harder time maintaining his composure and exclaimed to me, \"Can you believe Princess fucking Leia is in the store right now?!!!\" He did this just as she was leaving the store and walking past us. In fact, Ms. Fisher and I had a long moment of eye-contact. She had a very knowing and flattered smile on her face while I just gave her a goofy little smirk and pointed at him with subtle rolling eyes. \"Have a good afternoon Ms. Fisher\" I said as the other employee turned beet-red with embarrassment. \"You too boys,\" she replied. \"And you should quit smoking those things - they'll kill ya.\" \n\nSo that's my Carrie Fisher story.

            "comment": "I got to meet her one year I was working backstage security at DragonCon here in Atlanta. I was standing around backstage while the room was being filled, checking in on our VIPs when Carrie came in with her crew. I knew one of her guest escorts so I said hi to him. He introduced me to Carrie and I told her how wonderful it was to meet her. She shook my hand and looked intently at my face. Then she pulled out a make-up case and a brush and started brushing something on to the left side of my face. I looked at Fritz, her escort, and he said, \"She's been doing this all day.\" Carrie grabbed my chin and turned my face back to her. She then finished COVERING the left side of my face with glitter, cocked her head to take a more critical view of her work, nodded, and went on to her next appearance. She never spoke to me the entire time but booped my nose as she walked away.\n\nI kept running into other people on the crew that day who had glitter dust on their faces. Everyone just smiled and said, \"Oh, you ran in to Carrie, too.\"\n\nSuper nice lady. She will definitely be missed.\n\nEDIT: Wow, my first Reddit Gold just for telling a cute little encounter. I just thought sharing that story might make a few people smile. My girlfriend got her picture taken with her the same weekend. Carrie showed up at a group Princess Leia cosplay photo and my girlfriend wound up right next to her. Very sweet lady.",

George came up to me the first day of filming, took one look at the dress and said: 'You can't wear a bra under that dress.'\n \n'OK, I'll bite,' I said. 'Why?' And he said: 'Because ... there's no underwear in space.'\n \nHe said it with such conviction. Like he had been to space and looked around and he didn't see any bras or panties anywhere.\n \nHe explained. 'You go into space and you become weightless. Then your body expands but your bra doesn't, so you get strangled by your own underwear.'\n \nI think that this would make for a fantastic obituary. I tell my younger friends that no matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.\"\n\nI'll always remember you, General Organa. Drowned in moonlight, strangled by your own bra. \n\nEdit: source of quote ",

His last months were painful, and he still made his art priority.\n\nHeart attacks don't allow for a whole lot of time and planning though. It was unfortunate coincidence Fisher went out shortly after The Force Awakens. I think most of us would prefer she had enough time for her star to fade again some before the end.",

When someone goes hypoxic (lacking oxygen) for a certain period of time it's possible to save the body, but the brain is irreversibly damaged. What we do is inject a small amount of radioactive material into the blood stream and then capture the images of the radioactivity as it flows toward the brain. They're pretty sad and very unambiguous when you read them. Since the brain no longer needs the blood, it gets diverted to the face and you can see an accumulation of radiotracer in the nose, giving it a so-called hot nose sign. Obligatory medical reference: [Hot Nose](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/brain-death-2)\n\nMy guess as a physician, is that they did one of those studies on her, then decided to pull plug and say goodbye. \n\nGoodbye Princess.

I did love to teach and honestly, a lot of what I do is really, really fascinating, but not widely taught or publicized except to radiologists themselves. A lot of clinicians (i.e. physicians who see patients in person for a living) don't even know what the hell it is we do or what we can do. So often I'll get calls from other doctors with a problem about a patient and my job as consultant is to help them pick the best type of exam to help answer their question. \n\n",

            "comment": "To call Princess Leia \"my first crush\" is true, but also woefully incomplete. For myself, and an entire generation of boys, it was so important that the woman we all fell in love with growing up was so much more than a pretty face. Yes, she could somehow make an earmuff hairdo work. But she was also smart as hell, a take-charge badass who was fearless in the face of danger and unwaveringly devoted to doing the right thing. When her boyfriend got kidnapped, she lead the effort to rescue him...and when some gross dude tried to make her his slave, she literally choked him to death. Being in love with Leia meant that a lot of us learned to look for a smart, capable woman who was every bit the equal of the men around her, years before we'd learn words like \"feminism.\" (She was also the reason that a LOT of little sisters, including my own, got invited to play in their brothers' Star Wars games).\n\n\nAs I got older, I gained a greater appreciation for how much Carrie had to overcome in her personal life, and how smart and funny she actually was. She was hilarious in Blues Brothers, Austin Powers, and 30 Rock. She was a hugely talented writer (fun fact: she was one of the top script doctors in Hollywood throughout the 90's, and helped write a load of popular films including Hook and the Wedding Singer). Most importantly, she was totally unafraid to be herself in an industry that relentlessly pushes women to conform. Even if she had never been Leia, she would have left an impressive legacy behind.\n\n\nThis has been a rough year in all sorts of ways, but losing Carrie has been one of the toughest blows of all. Thanks for everything Carrie, and may the force be with you.\n",

            "comment": "Beyond the white cloak of Princess Leia, Carrie Fisher was a largely uncredited but magnificent screenwriter for The Wedding Singer, Scream, Sister Act, The River Wild, Hook, Lethal Weapon 3, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and four Star Wars movies. As someone who has also battled the demons of addiction and depression, Carrie Fisher was tenacious and inspiring. So upon hearing the news today, I told my wife what you would expect. I told her she should dress in the Star Wars metal bikini because it's what Carrie Fisher would have wanted. And when she said, \"get lost\", I settled for watching The Wedding Singer. A classic!",

She was actively shopping at the vendor area, buying all sorts of trinkets and homemade jewelry from people who were thrilled to meet her. \n     He Q&amp;A panel was absolutely hilarious, she's so funny and candid. Her goof ball dog Gary Fisher joined her onstage as well. \n\nI'm so sad to see her gone, she was a part of my childhood. But I'm glad I saw her in person before she left us. ",

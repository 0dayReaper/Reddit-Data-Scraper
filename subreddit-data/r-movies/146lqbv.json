I\u2019m so close to having watched all Leo movies, I\u2019m going to attempt to watch the ones I\u2019ve always looked over!\n\nNot far behind Leo, Ed Norton and Jim Carrey both at 22, which reminded me what a draw Jim was in the 90\u2019s. There\u2019s more of a gap between Drew and the others with Nicole Kidman 19 and Sandra Bullock 14. \n\nWho\u2019s in your top spots?",

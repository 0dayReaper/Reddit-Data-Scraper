            "comment": "I wrote about this once, but Mr. Rogers saved my mother's sanity. \n\nMy brother was sick as a child and needed to see specialists who couldn't really give my mother a real diagnosis. Psychiatric conditions? Allergies? Neurological? Whatever it was, my brother was in a lot of pain and the ONLY thing that could routinely calm him and keep him happy was to watch Mr. Rogers. We'd watch it together every afternoon, my mom called PBS and they *sent* her VHS of the episodes. \n\nI don't know why, but she wrote him a letter thanking him. A couple of weeks later my mother receives a letter back. It's a typed letter and she assumes a form letter, but she reads it. The letter discusses how much he loves to read letters and how my brother's condition is exacerbated by the fact that doctors forget that children are children. It's a long letter - a full page - and references things my mother wrote. It's signed, in ink \"Fred Rogers.\" \n\nMy mother still has that letter, it's in a box, she had it framed. It was getting bleached, so she's put it somewhere where it won't deteriorate. My brother's condition was diagnosed and treated. That was more than 30 years ago, but that letter was *never* forgotten. I remember her taking it out when Fred Rogers died and we all read it. \n\nIt's one of those things that seems so trivial, but at the time probably meant the world to my mother and for that, I will always have a hard time reading about Mr. Rogers and not tearing up. I bought copies of his show to show my son because years later, it's the only thing worth watching. It never took children for granted, and even I love watching him. Looking forward to sharing that with my son. \n",

At the time, they were little understood and most doctors didn't believe they were real until a landmark book came out in 1995 - effectively he can't eat food dye, many complex sugars and wheat. He's learned to eat around those things, but as a child, especially in the 80s and food labeling laws were different, he couldn't and it was really bad. ",

Frustratingly enough red 40 is in liquid benedryl, exactly what you would take for an allergic reaction. They finally make it dye free now.",

Or maybe, if the truth be told, Mister Rogers went into battle against a little boy with a big sword, for Mister Rogers didn't\u00a0like\u00a0the big sword. It was one of those swords that really isn't a sword at all; it was a big plastic contraption with lights and sound effects, and it was the kind of sword used in defense of the universe by the heroes of the television shows that the little boy liked to watch. The little boy with the big sword did not watch Mister Rogers. In fact, the little boy with the big sword didn't know who Mister Rogers\u00a0was, and so when Mister Rogers knelt down in front of him, the little boy with the big sword looked past him and through him, and when Mister Rogers said, \"Oh, my, that's a big sword you have,\" the boy didn't answer, and finally his mother got embarrassed and said, \"Oh, honey, c'mon, that's\u00a0Mister Rogers,\" and felt his head for fever. Of course, she knew who Mister Rogers was, because she had grown up with him, and she knew that he was good for her son, and so now, with her little boy zombie-eyed under his blond bangs, she apologized, saying to Mister Rogers that she knew he was in a rush and that she knew he was here in Penn Station taping his program and that her son usually wasn't\u00a0like\u00a0this, he was probably just tired\u2026. Except that Mister Rogers wasn't going anywhere. Yes, sure, he was taping, and right there, in Penn Station in New York City, were rings of other children wiggling in wait for him, but right now his patient gray eyes were fixed on the little boy with the big sword, and so he stayed there, on one knee, until the little boy's eyes finally focused on Mister Rogers, and he said, \"It's not a sword; it's a death ray.\" A death ray! Oh, honey, Mommy\u00a0knewyou could do it\u2026.And so now, encouraged, Mommy said, \"Do you want to give Mister Rogers a hug, honey?\" But the boy was shaking his head no, and Mister Rogers was sneaking his face past the big sword and the armor of the little boy's eyes and whispering something in his ear\u2014something that, while not changing his mind about the hug, made the little boy look at Mister Rogers in a new way, with the eyes of a child at last, and nod his head yes.\n\n&gt; We were heading back to his apartment in a taxi when I asked him what he had said.\n\n&gt; \"Oh, I just knew that whenever you see a little boy carrying something like that, it means that he wants to show people that he's strong on the outside. I just wanted to let him know that he was strong on the inside, too. And so that's what I told him. I said, 'Do you know that you're strong on the inside, too?' Maybe it was something he needed to hear.\"\n\nGood God.",

This guy cares about humans. \n\nHe molded me to be the best version of myself but like many others as I got older I got colder. Kids were and still are atrocious to each other in elementary school. Then you mix puberty with middle/high school peer pressure and you become something foreign to your previous self. Only now in my early 30s can I actually understand what Mr. Rogers was saying to me and the ideals he instilled in me are indeed still there just hidden under years of negative influences, politics, anger, drugs, alcohol, media. Fred knew that kids brains were being rotted out from television so instead of protesting it he found strength in it. \n\nIm not a religious man but Ive heard a saying that one cannot be a Christian, only strive to be. One cannot be on Mr Rogers level of peace, tranquilty, acceptance and love. One can only strive to remember his pure and beautiful way of viewing humanity because it's seems unobtainable in the world we live in today.\n\nKnock this one out of the park Tom Hanks. Multiple generations will be watching. \n\n",

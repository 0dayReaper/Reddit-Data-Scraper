Somebody posted an Indian politician that was sitting down in front of microphones answering questions, smiling and having fun. All of the sudden his eyes just role back and smile is wiped away... He just died right there on the spot in front of everybody. Scary fucking shit\n\nEdit: [this is the clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAL83Yq_DSc)\n\nEdit 2: Yooo what's wrong with some of you? I'm not making anybody watch this and nobody is forcing you to click the link. I haven't even watched it again, I just provided a source for the many that have asked for it.",

I mean, if it\u2019s very clear there\u2019s no chance of recovery - only suffering. Then why force people to do the suffering? Makes no sense. We\u2019re kinder to our animals than to people in this area. Well in other countries anyway.  \n\nYeah relief for sure. There wasn\u2019t much doubt it would be granted, but all the same she was very happy it was all arranged for in time and was really grateful to the doctor. It\u2019s already quite surreal as a witness though, can\u2019t imagine what it must\u2019ve been like for herself. I mean\u2026 You deliberately make the choice of going to lay down to die there and then to prevent an inevitable other mode of death. You don\u2019t really have a choice about dying, just the way you die. But still, you must go lay down and get it over with. What\u2019s also quite amazing is the trends we observed in her fitness watch. The moment she had decided which day she\u2019d die, the average heart rate dropped significantly - thus finding rest/peace. Its impossible to imagine what people with such diseases go through and how the decision making works at that point. All I know is you need fucktons of courage either way.",

It was an outdoor venue and stage was up this big hill, the concert ends and somehow we still hadn\u2019t got caught (this was early 2000\u2019s) when my friend spots him and says \u201choly f*ck that\u2019s the guy from goodfellas!\u201d\n\nIt was our fav movie so I walked up, asked if he was Ray Liotta - of course it was,  can\u2019t really mistake him for anyone else haha - and just said how big of a fan I was of him. He said thank you and all that and as I was about to walk away he put his arm around my shoulder and then his entire body weight onto me and asked if we could help walk him to his limo. He, uhh, must\u2019ve had a little too much to drink that night and needed help down the hill \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nSo for about 15 mins walking through a crowd of people my friend and I had Ray Liotta on our shoulders chatting about high school, sports, fav bands, music, etc. it was surreal.  We got to his limo said goodbye and he plopped in and went on his way. \n\nMy friend and I were so giddy we went straight home and put the goodfellas dvd in and watched it till like 3am.  \n\nAnyway, thought that would make some of y\u2019all laugh a bit. He was not just a great actor but a truly good and down to earth person as well.  \n\nRIP Ray",

Sadly his daughter had a daughter who died at 19 in a car accident in January 2021, just months before her father passed.",

He asked me how I liked it. Politely, I told him it was alright instead of telling him he should have never signed onto that ghost-bonking zom rom com garbage. Went on to tell him I was the only guy in the theater and he chuckled at that.

            "comment": "I used to do stand in work for TV and film, when I was living in New York. I was standing in for Anna Gunn  on a television show called shades of blue. The scene was taking place in a very small dive bar somewhere in Brooklyn. My cue was to walk through the door walk past Ray Liotta, and then turn around and sit down at the bar next to him, then the two characters were to have a conversation. Ray didn\u2019t use a stand in ! He preferred to be on set at all times so he could see the crew working as well as communicate with the Director if necessary. He literally just sat on the stool the whole time but he wanted to be there. The second AD told me not to make small talk with Mr. Liotta, as he found it distracting. This was a general rule of being standing by the way, but I said of course I\u2019ll leave him be. So I did my movement a few times for camera set up, and then ended up sitting next TO Ray Liotta for  a good 20 to 30 minutes. I didn\u2019t say anything to him for about the first 10 minutes, simply making eye contact and giving a small smile and nod. Then he began to talk to me. He was very kind. He thanked me for doing such a good job. He asked how long I had been in the actors union, and we chatted about boring sets, prop food, and all sorts of other things that only actors on set would be able to chat about. He was very friendly and super kind. The  A.D. was rather confused that he was talking to me. But then figured I must not have spoken with him first, and that he left us alone. That\u2019s my Ray Liotta story. He was a consummate professional, a dedicated actor with a masterful craft. I couldn\u2019t help but remember that little anecdote when I saw he had died. I consider that little interaction one of the highlights of my 15 years in tv/film.",

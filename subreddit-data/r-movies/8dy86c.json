I know even Peter Dinklage has said the same, and how that's why he could never feel comfortable being any sort of representative on behalf of those with dwarfism, when he doesn't know how to be entirely at peace with it - and probably never will.\n\nFortunately, 90%  of me is driven, self-assured and content with who I am and how the people important to me perceive me. It's just that 10% that says to me *\"When you're dead, you're just going to be a fucking dwarf. To everyone else, that's all you are. A joke.\"* \n\nGotta keep silencing that voice and believe that I can have dignity and nuance like anyone else.\n\n**Edit:** I'm not really sure how to say this, but the people saying stuff like \"don't worry everyone feels that way about stuff they're insecure/depressed about,\" it isn't really helping. I've had depression and insecurity - that really isn't what I'm talking about. I'm *not* insecure or depressed about my dwarfism. This is much more of an external thing. How people perceive me is a very vocal and obvious force. This whole issue started a social movement in Germany recently when a dwarf actor died, because he was primarily referred to as a dwarf and nothing much else in the media. That's sickening. And people with dwarfism commit suicide because of how trapped it makes them feel.  This isn't about having a trait you feel down about. It's about the whole of society clearly seeing you as just a medical condition or a gimmick.",

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. Yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \u2018Don\u2018t!\u2019 and \u2018Hang on!\u2019, can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling. -David Foster Wallace\n\nI almost guarentee someone posted it, but it really does help the people who have friends/family commit suicide.",

Depression is still scoffed upon by some.\n\nAn acquaintance of mine had been depressed for about two decades and had therapy for about as long. The last two years especially were hard on her and she received 24 hour at home care. She still killed herself. Left a note written months before she did. Hanged herself in a small window of time where there wasn't anyone with her. Her husband was only gone for like thirty minutes and found her when he came back.\n\nEdit: I just want to make clear that I'm not against therapy. I do however feel like it's sometimes glorified. That you just have to talk to a professional who will cure you just like how a broken bone is healed by a cast for a few weeks. Unfortunately it's not that simple or fast for most. ",

He is notable for his height of 2 ft 8 in (81 cm), the result of achondroplasia dwarfism, making him one of the shortest men in the world. He is best known for playing Mini-Me in the Austin Powers series of comedy films, and for his brief appearance as Griphook the goblin in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.\"\n\n[Decenct Biography of him here](https://www.biography.com/people/verne-troyer-212241270). \n\nEdit: Some clarification about his role as Griphook.   \"In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Griphook is played by Verne Troyer, famous for playing Dr Evil's \"Mini-Me\" in the Austin Powers films. However, Griphook was voiced by Warwick Davis, who plays Professor Flitwick, as well as the first Gringotts goblin. Because the producers wanted a completely British cast, Verne Troyer was replaced by Warwick Davis to portray the role of Griphook in part two of the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

That's where the depression sinks in - knowing that everyone around you, by no fault of their own, will always define you by *that*. \n\nBut being treated as an equal...it means everything. Like when the kids on *South Park* rib on Timmy, it means he's just one of the guys and his impediments are just another thing to make fun of. In real life, it's not as simple. For Verne, I'm sure that feeling was hard to come by. I hope he's found peace, wherever he is. I hope he doesn't feel so alone anymore. \n\nRIP, fellow freak. \n\n**EDIT:** I'm definitely not saying you shouldn't hold the door open for people. What I'm saying is that people with disabilities tend to interpret the actions of others in light of said disabilities, which makes it hard to tell when people are treating you differently than they would others.",

Specifics aren't known yet, but signs are pointing toward complications from his longtime alcohol abuse and health problems stemmed thereof.\n\nHe's one of the biggest names in EDM (you've probably heard a song of his at some point in your life even if you don't like the genre). His style isn't everyone's cup of tea, but his influence is undeniable. He was also a genuinely good and humble guy who lived and breathed for his fans. It has left a pretty big void in the electronic music community.",

It's eye opening, despite already knowing how depression doesn't care who you are.\n\nIt's a shame, really. He was a good actor and had some really memorable roles. His roles were memorable not even because he was so short either, but he was actually a good actor beyond being a novelty role.\n\nHe was one of us too. Legit redditor, not just using as some PR platform but he actually posted content and discussed things he was into, completely unrelated from his stardom. Lol people apparently even called him a karma whore but all that means is dude knew how to get points, definitely one us\n\nEdit\n\nI think this was his best reddit post\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/grilledcheese/comments/6r7wl5/never_underestimate_the_size_of_deliciousness/dl46l8c",

                                    "comment": "One of the major reasons that newspapers and other established news organization often refuse to mention suicide as a cause of death is because of copycat suicides. My friend used to write and edit obituaries. Even if the family insisted that suicide be mentioned as the cause of death, the paper refused. When at-risk people read about suicides, they feel more comfortable trying it out for themselves. So yes, when an obit says \"lost a battle with X mental illness\" or \"suffered bravely til the end\" or \"struggled with addiction,\" the person probably did kill themselves, whether intentionally or not.\n\nThe refusal to publish suicide info (whether pertaining to a private citizen or to a celebrity) is part of the ethical guidelines established by news media associations. [This article describes the facts and rationale behind this self-censorship.](https://www.thedailybeast.com/teen-copycat-suicides-are-a-real-phenomenon)",

It's oftentimes perceived as a threat/manipulation tool (think \"wow now he's threatening to kill himself, very dramatic, \") or as something selfish (\"how could you even think about putting your family through that?\"). I have clinical depression and struggle with suicidal thoughts at times. It's REALLY hard to tell someone, because they might 1) take it personally 2) try to get you committed just for admitting you have thoughts even if you don't plan to act on them 3) accuse you of being dramatic or manipulative 4) say \"you're scaring me,\" and implying that it's wrong to talk about your suicidal thoughts.\n\nI once told my dad that I had called a suicide hotline that week. He treated me differently for months. There was no \"how do we get you into therapy\" or any of that, he was almost upset with me for going there. We need to work on getting rid of the stigma associated with talking about suicide. Everyone says to tell someone, but telling someone usually makes things worse. We need to teach people what to DO when a loved one confided that they're suicidal.",

He is best known for playing Mini-Me in the Austin Powers series of comedy films, and for his brief appearance as Griphook the goblin in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.\"\n\n[Decenct Biography of him here](https://www.biography.com/people/verne-troyer-212241270). \n\nEdit: Some clarification about his role as Griphook.   \"In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Griphook is played by Verne Troyer, famous for playing Dr Evil's \"Mini-Me\" in the Austin Powers films. However, Griphook was voiced by Warwick Davis, who plays Professor Flitwick, as well as the first Gringotts goblin. Because the producers wanted a completely British cast, Verne Troyer was replaced by Warwick Davis to portray the role of Griphook in part two of the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

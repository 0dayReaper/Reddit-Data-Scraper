A movie that is already incredible, and only enhanced so much more by the big screen experience. Any other movies set in space that would be put above it?",

But it\u2019s very much lacking in literary oomph. Plus, 2001 redefined the scope and scale of cinema. Every section was Kubrick changing the game and showing off. Interstellar is not that.",

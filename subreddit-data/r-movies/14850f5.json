    "postText": "Around 10:16 into the movie, Molly remembers working at a nightclub where it was common to see super-rich people to have $100,000+ bar tabs (while not drinking themselves), okay, but then the movie flashes up an example that has a total of $109,375.98. Above that, however, are the sales tax line &amp; the 'gratuity' lines, the sales tax being $11,888, which means a retail tax of &gt;10.85% (maybe?), meaning the gratuity would have to be around 30% to have a pre-tax subtotal of around $98,000 (plus 11,888 for sales tax is $109,888, close enough to the $109,375.88 original). 30% gratuity, my my how generous!!!! And almost 11% sales tax, higher than the California record of 10.25% that's NEVER been a grocery tax (food/liquor consumables) . HMMMMMMM....\n\nTHEN, there's a partially visible \"...B TOTAL \" line ABOVE the gratuity line that I would ASSUME says \"SUB TOTAL\" followed by (somehow...) a number that sure SEEMS to be at least $140,000....!!??!! Like WTF???!!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/43u73pytcp5b1.jpg?width=1364&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=88265e2c304cbcf97d7e5d0f32f389a26a681e8e",

Not because it was a bad film, but because these parents decided to bring their entire extended family ranging from newborn babies to maybe 8 year olds who were all wildly misbehaved. Newborn was screaming, crying, and babbling throughout the entire movie and the parents never tried to calm them down and never took them out of the theater. 3-4 year old kid had a raspy cough and would not ever cover his mouth, and it often was directed towards me. Him and some of the other children also got up and ran back and forth through the aisle stomping and talking at full volume. Parents did absolutely nothing. \n\nThe father also took off his socks and shoes and decided to lounge them up on the chair in front of him. I could smell them from 2 seats away. Every family member was having conversations at full volume throughout the whole movie. I will never understand people who don\u2019t respect basic theater etiquette and are completely oblivious to the fact other people paid for an undisturbed experience. \n\nI might be a bit more understanding if it were a G or PG movie but D&amp;D was a PG-13 film, and not a single one of their kids were near or over that age. Parents fault completely.",

Regresses the shit out of the main character so they can make a stupid please the audience movie out if it, the writing is all over the place, the Dub VA or director did a poor job of reprising their role as Violet Evergarden along with other voice overs that weren't as good as the anime, and so much of the film's story is needlessly pushed around, and it completely tarnished the look of the entire franchise.\n\nThat movie was a huge regret for me.

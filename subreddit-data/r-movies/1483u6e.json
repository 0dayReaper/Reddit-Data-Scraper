    "postText": "As the title states, I'm not a fan of Wes Anderson. I respect his artistic craftsmanship and his \"every frame a painting\" style, but in my experience, it never amounted to an overwhelmingly positive viewing experience.\n\nSomeone recommended Bottle Rocket to me many years ago, and I thought it was okay, but it didn't leave much of an impact on me. The same goes for Life Aquatic and Moonrise Kingdom. Maybe it's the rhythm of the dialogue that turns me off, or the laissez-faire, \"I'm such a nihilist, isn't that hilarious\" tone all of his characters seem to have.\n\nI've left some potential gems out there for me to be convinced. On Letterboxd, the top rated are Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel, and The Royal Tenenbaums. The French Dispatch is also an option.\n\nI don't often do complete 180s on my opinions of directors, but I recently had exactly that happen with Ari Aster. I hated Hereditary when it came out, but then I rewatched it this year and was blown away. It led to me watching and enjoying Midsommar, and Beau is Afraid is my favorite movie of the year (of 70 new movies I've seen this year).\n\nYou've can choose one of his films to convince me of his genius and convert me before I see Asteroid City. What is your choice and why?",

I think a more useful frame of reference is that his characters feel emotionally disconnected at the beginning but feel connected at the end.

Some of his movies are really just plays that happen to be filmed and *Tenenbaums* is one of those. For me, I find many of his films have a theme of personal redemption and character growth and I love those kind of movies. The scenes are really quirky and clever and the whole movie literally acts as a three part play, with the characters having a certain stiffness about them and their dialogue, like what you would see on stage. There is a lot of subtlety in the scenes and he really does a great job making use of the corners and backgrounds of the frame as you\u2019re watching it. I found the journey that each character took to be really neat; from where they started to where they ended was inspiring to see. It\u2019s not the kind of movie you can half pay attention to as you watch it, and you almost have to be prepared to immerse into it if you\u2019re really going to enjoy it for what it is. Wes Anderson movies are not for everyone though. *Tenenbaums* is one of my top five favorite movies ever, and my wife hates it.\n\nI know you\u2019re just asking about Wes Anderson movies, but if you are asking about Wes Anderson movies then you may also really enjoy *Me, Earl, and The Dying Girl.* If you haven\u2019t seen it, that movie has almost the same kind of vibe and character journey of an Anderson film.",

There\u2019s so many different locations, on-screen text, flashbacks, montage, etc. I think you\u2019re under-selling the amount of pure filmmaking that went into that production. You couldn\u2019t do that entire opening about the Tenebaum family history on stage. That \u201cNeedle in the Hay\u201d scene, with the quick-cutting and jump cuts, that would not be as effective on stage.",

So I watched a few more of his films and did not like them very much and decided Wes Anderson is not for me lol. \n\nSo I would nominate the grand Budapest hotel. It is the only Wes Anderson film I have truly enjoyed (and I have watched quite a few).",

It exemplifies everything he does best. \n\nThat being said, I think most people who love his movies are in love with his style. The aesthetics of all his films and the quirky way he writes. I do like to think of them more as fluid visual art pieces rather than movies in the traditional sense. None have blown me away with intricate plotting, intense drama, overtly amazing performances, complex characters, etc. I'm pretty sure the artistic craftsmanship and his \"every frame a painting\" style are largely what makes his movies appeal to people, so if those don't work for you or arem't enough to make you fall in love with his style then I don't think anything will. Which is perfectly fine",

I'd say Grand Budapest is his least weird/quirky/offbeat movie, so probably has more mainstream appeal but still has Wes Anderson-ness to it in terms of characters, dark humor, visual style.  I think it's his best and one my favorites.  \n\nRushmore is a bit more tame, dry but also very good.  Moonrise/Aquatic/Tenenbaums are probably peak Wes Anderson IMO and not for everyone.  Dispatch is up there but still very good, just a bit long with the 3 stories.",

Not many directors are capable of pulling this off.\n\n\n",

This is the first time in over twenty years a Disney film has had that long a short in front of it. \n\nAnd then there's content: Olaf was the comic relief of *Frozen.* Despite his popularity, not many would want a continual run of the comic relief for that long. And then there's the songs--repetitive and not nearly as memorable as the original movie's.\n\nMost damningly, the presence of the Olaf short film meant that there wasn't a Pixar short film, which are held in almost universal high esteem.\n\nEdit: a word",

An adult has to wait an extra twenty minutes on stupid crap, they think well this sucks. A little kid has to do it-- and remember, it's the twenty minute short, plus ten or fifteen minutes of previews, plus a few minutes of the theater's \"turn off your phones, go get concessions\" stuff, plus however early you decided to show up for the movie\n\nAnd by the end of it you've got yelly cranky kids who have to take potty breaks in the middle of the movie and don't want to sit still that long after three and a half hours or so now\n\nAnd it's like come on. It's really tough for kids to be cool about that.\n\nPlus Disney realized without it they could cram in extra showings. ",

Stick something like that in front of Cars 2 or The Good Dinosaur, I think complaints would be a lot less prominent. Stick it in front of a movie getting lauded like Coco and you create a problem. People would probably be fine with a long short if it preceded a 'meh' movie, rather than an excellent one. ",

It's hard to think of a good comparison to a western film though.\n\nI won't say it's a film you should go out of your way to watch but it's something I might tune in to if it popped up on TV and there wasn't much else to watch ,  which it won't since I don't live in China ",

Don't just complain about the sequels, go see the other films, and if something is really good, tell people about it. This is happening not just in films, but also series, games, books, basically every kind of entertainment. So much money is being poured into the massive franchises that it's virtually impossible for smaller, original projects to find an audience. If you want to see more original stuff, seek it out, but also help spread the word when you find something you like.",

Since 1980 is as far back as I can see on IMDB, let's look at that.  16 of the top 25 were adaptations, remakes or sequels:\n\n* Empire Strikes Back (sequel)\n* Any Which Way You Can (sequel)\n* Coal Miner's Daughter (adaptation of a biography)\n* Smokey and the Bandit II (sequel)\n* The Blue Lagoon (adaptation of a novel)\n* The Blues Brothers (adaptation of characters from SNL)\n* Ordinary People (adaptation of a novel)\n* Popeye (adaptation of a comic strip character)\n* Urban Cowboy (adaptation of an article originally published in Esquire)\n* The Shining (adaptation of a novel)\n* Cheech &amp; Chong's Next Movie (sequel)\n* Brubaker (adaptation of a novel)\n* The Jazz Singer (remake)\n* Flash Gordon (adaptation of a comic strip character)\n* Lady &amp; the Tramp (re-issue)\n* The Elephant Man (adaptation of a biography)\n\nLook at other years; you'll see similar trends.  Even if you look way back to the '30s and '40s, there were plenty of adaptations of past characters, novels and stage plays.  I know there are a lot more remakes now, but what were you supposed to remake when films barely existed?\n\nMany films that are considered among the greatest ever fit this category - The Godfather, Raging Bull, Gone with the Wind, Silence of the Lambs, Psycho, The Wizard of Oz, The Shawshank Redemption, the list goes on and on.\n\nEdit: [Link to the list.](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1980)  Also, of the 9 original films in the top 25 for 1980, 3 had later sequels (Airplane!, Caddyshack, Friday the 13th) and 2 had a spinoff TV series (9 to 5, Private Benjamin).",

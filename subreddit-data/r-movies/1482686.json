Often those approaching the truth are sharply yanked back.\n\n*Source: [tvtropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OntologicalMystery)\n\nI believe one of my favorite *Twilight Zone* episodes (\u201cFive Characters In Search of an Exit\u201d) qualifies.",

After he arrives, his dead lover appears on the space station. The psychologist discovers that all the other crew members have also encountered manifestations of dead loved ones. Eventually, he realizes that the planet is creating these entities using the memories of the station crew in an attempt to communicate with and understand humans.\n\nThe movie was based on a novel by polish sci fi author Stanislaw Lem. It was adapted twice, first in the 70s, by Soviet director Andrei Tarkofsky, and later by Steven Soderberg. As a pretentious douche, I prefer the original. The only good thing about the remake was the soundtrack. And Natascha McElhone.",

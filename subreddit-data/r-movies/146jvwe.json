    "postText": "I want to talk with someone about The Movie your name, people for the longest time have told me to watch it and they said it was the greatest movie of all time and I watched it recently, I'm disappointed with MYSELF bc I had a hard time connecting with the movie, and it's not like I have an emotional range of a teaspoon, on the very contrary, I get emotional very easily, my fav anime movie of all time is even A silent voice and I cried almost the entire time, and people told me your name is even sadder, but to be honest I felt disconnected most of the movie, I did get a little emotional at the times but nothing close to the way other shows and movies have hit me before and I want to know if other people also felt this way.\n\nI do have to admit the music is phenomenal and the animation is amazing, it has everything working right for me except the story which did not connect with me which makes me feel bad bc everything I watch I do with open arms hoping that ill enjoy it. unfortunately, it just didn't click which is a shame.",

Your Name is more of an adventure with a grander story. I was more shocked than sad in Your Name and the only sad part I can remember there was when they tried to write their names.",

It was a good movie, it looked great, but I felt like it should've been so much more than it was. The a girl from a small town and a boy from a big city sometimes waking up in each other's bodies without knowing anything is such an amazingly rich concept with so much you can explore. \n\nAll I knew about it going in was that it was well loved and the basic concept about body swapping. With that I was really looking forward to seeing which of the many themes they would choose to explore with it. It's just such a great setup. You could so easily explore anything from body dysphoria, gender roles, consent, bias, etc. Instead the movie just explored none of those, went for a star-crossed-lovers plot, and fell into so many bullshit anime tropes. They need to save the town from destruction, lack of consent is played as a joke, there are so many needless \"fan service\" shots throughout the movie.",

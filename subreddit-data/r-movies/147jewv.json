    "postText": "Hi, i saw memento for the first time, i noticed something. At the end of the film \u00e8 wrote down on the polaroid \"Don't believe his lies\" polaroid number 12847001532. At the beginning of the film when the polaroid says \" Don't believe his lies he is the one kill him\" same polaroid number. But the scene after when he is writing the second part of the sentence the polaroid number is : 07946087152. Is this an error or has a meaning?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vnt08n0mzj5b1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5b13d7026b417b3b650d6d2951e5cc4f1ab33652\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uyp0qn0mzj5b1.jpg?width=1481&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cf4a48f5ddc9e7b6c058feb59bab20452f3c59b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7jqoq0mzj5b1.jpg?width=1471&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=88b8bd4fe97aece5012569023205d53987081c05",

For example, the budget for Memento was $9 million, and the budget for TDKR was $265 million.\n\nEither that, or it is an amazing Easter egg that has gone unnoticed for 23 years and adds yet another layer to Memento, which I kinda hope is the case tbh.",

If it really were two different Polaroids, Leonard would have had to take the exact same picture twice, but obviously he only takes one and then he and Teddy split up, so there\u2019s no time for a 2nd photo. And it wouldn\u2019t serve any purpose for there to be 2 of the same photo. If they did multiple takes for scenes where Leonard is writing on the Polaroids, they would need to get a new one every time they shot the scene, which is almost certainly what happened.",

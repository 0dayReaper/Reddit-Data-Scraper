    "postText": "In the near future, a woman works as a boarder agent on the boarder of NYC, which has been shut off to fend for itself. She learns from a smuggler that there is a way in and out, and decides to take advantage of that to sneak in to find her son, whom she was separated from when the city was originally shuttered. She finds that he has become a notorious killer, under the power of her gang member ex, who himself has built a lot of power on the island. The son also loves to paint and is secretly a sensitive artist, despite his propensity for murder. Eventually there is a power struggle on the island and then for some reason an election of a leader. The women who control the water supply have a lot of power, and play an important political role.",

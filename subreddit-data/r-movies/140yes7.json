I had no intention of going back to a 3rd party option because I didn't think it would be necessary, but I was so wrong. Every update had a chance to break something new. It was constantly dealing with poor UI decisions or being unable to look at user profiles, no longer being able to download videos, search issues, you name it. I was basically forced to go back to 3rd party options to use the site like normal on mobile. It's actually frustrating. \n\nThey've had the official app for years at this point and it is still plagued with issues. This wouldn't be as horrible if their app wasn't just actual garbage. But even then, attacking clear supporters and users of your website because it makes it harder for you stuff ads down your users throats is scummy and fucked up. Reddit doesn't deserve it's userbase at this point.",

I just don't know where to find specialized, potentially long form discussions. Stuff like Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, etc. are fine, but they are all brevity focused content. Fine for saying \"This is a single post of my thoughts on this,\" but notice any substantial discussion gets \"1/.\" Especially for hobbyists and niche interests, it's way better to have actual threads on topics you can search, where posts can be one sentence or six paragraphs depending on how much actually needs to be said.\n\nIt took me forever to switch from actual forums to Reddit, and if it fails, we're basically back to square one as the Internet basically abandoned the forum concept in favor of one centralized site with \"sub\" websites on specific things. If Reddit vanishes, there's not a lot of alternatives, at least not famous ones that people know about already. Discord is a modern day AIM/MSN Messenger. YouTube is video based. Am I really going to have to go back to Facebook and join interest groups there?",

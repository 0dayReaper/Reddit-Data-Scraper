    "postText": "In my opinion, an example of this is The Princess Bride. An excellent film, a real classic from the \u201880s, but the cinematography is sloppy and amateurish at times. Another one would be the best picture winner Spotlight, which IMO had some really poor shots and I believe were what cost it the best director award that year.",

It's quite flat looking and looked like a TV movie at times. \n\n\nThough I appreciate the reasoning in their choice of aspect ratio and colours. Joss Whedon's TV background did stick out in his visual choices. \n\nMind you, Age of Ultron did look a lot better, cinematically. Which showed his evolving confidence.",

Final scene would be the talk Lovell has with his wife at the party and people would froth over it despite it being a pile of incoherent garbage. If his new film is anything like Tenet I\u2019ll give up on him. He\u2019s been seriously downhill since Dunkirk.",

Lots of excellent imagery and cinematography is still present, but yeah it was shot on a rinky-dinky little digital camera, and the results can tend to speak for themselves",

The fact that it doesn't look polished and a bit amateurish is one of the reasons it is so unsettling.  That movie to me is a prime example of ugly cinematography being appropriate cinematography.",

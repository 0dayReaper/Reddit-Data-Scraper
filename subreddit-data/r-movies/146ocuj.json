    "postText": "We all know *Casino Royale* is one of the great Bond films, and possibly even one of the best action films of all time, but I think it's sometimes easy to overlook how masterful that B&amp;W opening scene is. It feels to me as a sort of \"microcosm\" of the rest of the film, and shows us many key characteristics about Craig's new incarnation of Bond, all in just a few minutes;\n\n* Bond's situational awareness and tactical intelligence to unload the gun in the office\n* Bond's capabilities as a physical brawler in the bathroom fight\n* Bond's unflinching willingness to kill in cold blood to complete the mission\n\nI can't think of another action film with an intro that does character exposition so succinctly and effectively. \n\n(Then launching straight from this scene into the Chris Cornell track \\[rest his soul\\] just puts it over the top).",

It shows up occasionally in the earlier movies, like the fight scene on the train in From Russia with Love.\n\nMost of the movies, prior to Casino Royale, show a more cerebral Bond that is calculating and ahead of the game, there's always a plan, and his need to adapt and adjust is just a consequence of the fact that he doesn't literally control everything - but he's always got the right tool from Q to fill the gaps. The Bond of the books doesn't think quite so far ahead. He's not just going off half cocked, but there's only so much you can figure out before you get into the middle of something, so he figures out what he can and then jumps in to figure the rest out.\n\nThe Bond of the movies pits Bond against other people in Baccarat, where he can beat an opponent with skill. The Bond of the books went to the Roulette table and risked his (plot relevant) cash against the universe. He's reckless, and lucky.",

Base jumping off the dam shows his level of athleticism.\n\n2. Quipping to the soldier on the toilet before knocking him out shows his humor- this is a Bond so comfortable being Bond that he has to make the job more entertaining to himself by making jokes.\n\n3. His meeting with 006 establishes that they\u2019ve worked together many times by having them say things that you\u2019d only understand if you were familiar with the person saying them - this Bond is a team player, *not* a lone wolf. He doesn\u2019t just work with Trevelyan, he\u2019s established a, ahem, *bond* with him.\n\n4. His dialog with 006 also establishes Bond\u2019s allegiance to the State- Bond isn\u2019t a mercenary, he believes he is doing good for all of England. Of course this is brilliantly called back at the end of the film to cap off Bond\u2019s character arc.\n\n5. Apart from the toilet slap, Bond carries himself through the mission with a serious and professional demeanor, though still quips on occasion: \u201cShut the door Alec, there\u2019s a draft!\u201d.\n\n6. Bond shows a brief moment of pain when 006 is \u201ckilled\u201d, but immediately puts his mind back on the mission, shortening the timers on the explosives. Through this, we see that Bond has human emotions but will still put the mission first.\n\n6. Using the cart of explosive gas canisters for cover to escape shows Bond\u2019s resourcefulness. Switching on the conveyor belt, shooting the latches holding back the gas canisters and riding the belt out of the building furthers Bond\u2019s resourcefulness and quick thinking.\n\n7. When one of Ourumov\u2019s guards shoots at Bond while he\u2019s hiding behind the gas canisters, Ourumov kills the guard, then Bond shares a \u201ccan you believe that guy\u201d nod with Ourumov, showing that Bond has a professional respect for his foes.\n\n8. Chasing after the plane on the motorcycle and skydiving into it shows the level of just balls-out risk taking that he will resort to when necessary. Successfully catching the plane and flying it away shows that Bond is a fucking boss.",

We live in a world of many franchises, and I don't think there are any that have changed as much as Bond.

Human civilians\n\nThis power hierarchy never changes during the movie. It creates a static background for Neo's arc. \n\nWithout burdening the audience with tons of dialogue, it is still 100% clear what Neo's \"power level\" is at any point and when he ascends to the next level. \n\nThe movie also has as many scenes of Neo failing as of him succeeding. Neo fails to go out the window &amp; gets arrested, fails to beat Morpheus in the dojo, fails the jump program, fails to believe he is the One, loses the subway fight with Smith until the last moment, and gets shot dead by Smith in the hotel. \n\nIn a movie where a character goes from a schlubby bachelor hacker to the God of his reality, it's notable that the movie is tense and believable all the way through. Because it's a jagged up and down story arc instead of Neo just constantly powering up. And even as he is getting more powerful, he gets confronted with new challenges. He is not invincible until the last 30 seconds of the movie.\n\nSo the introduction and rooftop chase is CRUCIAL for this movie.\n\nOn top of that this scene introduces Trinity's character, establishes Trinity's relationships with Morpheus and Cypher, shows us redpill superpowers, establishes the phones as Matrix exits, establishes the Agents as the film's antagonists &amp; shows they are not merely cops, ends on a cliffhanger that draws us into the film, and familiarizes us with the abandoned-hotel location that will be used again at the end of the story.\n\nThe Wachowskis spent 5 years writing this script, this is what happens when a script is polished for half a decade. Not only is every scene essential, not only does every scene add to the story but usually a scene in this film is doing 3 or 4 things at once to give the audience information about the story and characters.",

            "comment": "Batman Begins introducing Bruce Wayne as a child to an adult in a prison cell perfectly encapsulated Batman in the The Dark Knight trilogy. He does this in less than 10 mins, but he establishes Bruce Wayne\u2019s whole character in terms of mood, while giving you a sense that Batman is haunted by the ghosts of his past. The character is a mystery that is slowly solved through the 3 films, but it\u2019s very nicely set up in Begins. \n\nOn that same note, The Dark Knight intro sequence establishes The Joker perfectly as well. Smart, lucky, crazy, and interesting. Great introduction imo.",

When the homeless person passes, he turns the music back up and pretends to be a badass again.  \n\nThe sequence tells you everything you need to know about that character,  and it's only 10 or so seconds long.",

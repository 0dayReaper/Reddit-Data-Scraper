    "postText": "This movie came out in 2001 and was ridiculously ahead of its time. Absolute top tier cringe and shock comedy that you can trace a direct line to Comedy Central, YouTube, and others produced stuff over a decade later. Tom Greene is a bit of a nut but he was super ambitious in this film considering the context of the time period. His dynamic with Rip Thorn is absolutely legendary and produced multiple genuine belly laughs from me and everyone I've ever shown this movie to.\n\nI know that this movie was shit on constantly upon release but it has truly held up as a comedy well ahead of its time. If this was released in 2023 it would easily be a success imo!\n\nIf you have never seen this film, or never watched it because of the reviews, and you can take abstract comedy this is 100% worth a watch!!\n\nWhat do yall think of this film?",

Fast forward to 2016 this same guy is pulled over for a broken tail light and this is when police look him up and see an outstanding warrant for his arrest. Basically a collection agency was trying to collect on the unreturned property. He agrees to go down to the police station for processing. He then posts online what happened and it goes viral. Tom Green finds out, calls the guy and offers to pay off the debt for him.\n\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/weird-news/man-arrested-overdue-freddy-got-fingered-video-rental-2002-n545366",

A lot of scenes are leading to really standard movie expectations and then he takes a massive left turn, or just fucks with it.\n\nThe end where he flies the helicopter onto the roof to meet the girl comes to mind. It's a huge cliche moment but he just does it all backwards. It's like the big romantic scene where he wins back the girl, but he's yelling and you still can't hear him over the helicopter. Then when she's supposed to be saying how much she loves him, she instead says she just wants to &gt;!suck his cock!&lt;. \n\nThe movie does stuff like that a lot. Sets up a standard scene we've seen a thousand times then just sends it off the rails. The movie is for sure smarter than people give it credit for,I believe that 100%.",

Maybe it's because I identified with the wasted, directionless talent of a character who failed to launch... hell, failed at even trying to launch. Didn't have a care if he launched or not. Even back in my late teens at the time, I saw the mirror he was holding up to the absurdity that the world considered successful. Money, women, cars (do you see two Lebarons, Freddie?), careers, all of that. \n\nI'm not going to call it brilliant by any means. It's honestly stupid. Utterly, fucking dumb. It's not nuanced. There's no real nuggets of wisdom. Nothing. But, there's something to matching societal absurdity with individual absurdity. That's what the best screwball comedies have always done, and this one fits right in there like a cheese sandwich in your bum bum.",

We had watched Road Trip and were well aware of his output. He did what he wanted when he could - You\u2019ve got to respect that, and years later it\u2019s earned it\u2019s cult status. \n\nProbably speaks volumes that it hit with 13 year old skate punks, but to this day it\u2019s highly quotable, so fun to watch and it\u2019s offbeat gross out humour and ridiculous scenes are just a break from formuliac films.\n\nRip Torn is fucking amazing in it!",

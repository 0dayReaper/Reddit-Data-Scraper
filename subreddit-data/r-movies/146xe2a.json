Its not so much that I like based on a true story movies, it's that I like well-paced movies with witty dialogue. It just so happens that based on a true story movies happen to be dialogue centric and story beat rich.\n\nAnyone have recommendations for other movies that fit with the movies I mentioned above?\n\nI have already seen the Social Network and I Love you Phillipe Morris.",

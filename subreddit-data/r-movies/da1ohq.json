I'd much rather have Spider-Man get formally shuffled out of the MCU, rather than just suddenly vanishing (though FFH's ending could absolutely work as a reason for the character to go permanently underground). \n\nPlus, the next Doctor Strange movie is literally about the multiverse. It should be very easy to slide the character between Sony &amp; Disney's franchises if that's the direction they want to go.",

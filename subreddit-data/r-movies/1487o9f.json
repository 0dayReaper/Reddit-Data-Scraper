Action turns me on in a movie,, I want to get recommendations for the best movies or series with action scenes. I mean best actions. If you see someone mention one that you've watched just back them or not. Banshee, Strike back, mad fury were somehow good to me but I think there are  best stuffs out there that I miss",

    "postText": "There\u2019s only one theater in my state that can show oppenheimer in Imax 70mm, but all of the \u201cgood seats\u201d (ie anything not in the front few rows or at the sides) are taken at all of the weekend showings (i can\u2019t make it during the week) through the beginning of August. I\u2019m not sure how long movies typicall run for, google says 4 weeks so that limits it roughly to the tickets available for presale, but its also highly probably that the movie has a longer run right? I don\u2019t really know much about stuff like that.\n\nDoes it make sense to wait until more showings become available so i can try to get better seats? Or should i just try to get the seats on the sides of the theater now incase the run isn\u2019t much longer? (Again i dont know how any of that stuff works).  If it influences things, this theater is massive.",

And it\u2019s the only movie this summer actually shot on 70mm imax film so it probably sticks around for a bit in that particular theater for that reason. \n\nIt\u2019s not guaranteed but I think you can gamble on there being more 70mm showings. But I\u2019m paranoid so I think I\u2019d rather see it in 70mm on the side of the theater than risk not seeing it.",

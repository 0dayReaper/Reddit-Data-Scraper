I've seen and discussed this Disney+ 4K release and looks absolutely horrible in many shots. It is absolutely an upscale, and the word is that Disney+ will be what goes on the BR as well when it releases the 20th. Bitrate isn't the problem, rather it seems they've used AI upscaling and a lot of shots just look awful.\n\nAnd yet supposedly the reason we're waiting on all of James Cameron's other movies to be released in 4K is because he wanted to personally sign off on each one, and he said that like 10 years ago.",

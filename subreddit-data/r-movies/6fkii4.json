No fuckin' clue how he managed that back then. I can still clearly hear the \"What's all this?\" and the \"AaaAaHh *glass breaking*\" sounds for errors and stuff.",

Mickey Mouse, Wile E Coyote, Green Giant brand avatar etc. They'd have the characters arms pointing as the watch hands. I was going through the box after he passed and a bunch were taken apart. No clue why, I thought he was just tinkering with them for the hell of it like he did with a lot of shit. *Yeeaaarss* later I find this precision measuring device of his like [this] (http://www.hhip.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/4/1/4100-2430.jpg) that he had taken apart and replaced the dial's hand with Mickey's. That was a really satisfying mystery to solve.",

They did recast Phil with Billy West as Zapp Brannigan (I don't recall if they'd done a record with Phil or not but the role was originally written for him) though so who knows.",

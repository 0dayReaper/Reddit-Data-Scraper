    "postText": "It is difficult to discuss a \"favorite\" movie about suicide without triggering some people. This is a difficult topic, so please don't read further if it bothers you.\n\nIt's difficult from another perspective too, in that suicide is sometimes spoiler material. So, again, the following discussion may contain SPOILERS.\n\nHaving said that, let me explain what I mean by my original question. I mean a movie that you enjoy that happens to have a suicide in it or reference to it, or a movie that portrays the pain and agony that leads to suicide in such a good way that you can connect to it emotionally and therefore enjoy the film. There are other possibilities of course, such as a movie about suicide having a political message that you agree with (e.g., about euthanasia).\n\nAnyhow, my favorite ones are:\n\nWhat Dreams May Come (1998)\n\nDancer in the Dark (2000)\n\nGroundhog Day (1993)\n\nAftersun (2023)\n\nAnd this last movie on my list, which I watched today, is the reason I decided to pose the question. Needless to say, I recommend it strongly.",

            "comment": "I remember seeing Adam West and Burt Ward at Comic-Con in 2010. Funny, classy guys, both of them. They had the whole Q&amp;A audience laughing with anecdotes and jokes, and they even had little kids who had probably never seen any of the old Batman series in awe. \n\nI went up to the microphone and asked Adam West if he would dance the Batusi for us. He replied, \"Well... I don't have my cape! But seeing as how I am a master of The Boogie, I will!\", then he did. Delightful of him to humor such a lame request.\n\nAnother question someone had was, \"Burt, you were really young on set. Did Adam take you under his wing? Show you the ropes?\" Burt Ward looked over at Adam West and said, \"No, not really. He was supportive, but he also liked to take me to parties. Get me drunk....\"\n\nTo which Adam West leaned over and said into his microphone, \"O-R-G-Y!\"",

There was a time when Batman really kept me from getting some pretty good roles, and I was asked to do what I figured were important features. However, Batman was there, and very few people would take a chance on me walking on to the screen. And they\u2019d be taking people away from the story. So I decided that since so many people love Batman, I might as well love it too. Why not? So I began to reengage myself with Batman. And I saw the comedy. I saw the love people had for it, and I just embraced it.\u201d",

Everyone but the writer/director knew it was a student quality vanity piece but we all needed the paycheck. But Adam West treated the role with respect and took his job seriously. He knew EVERYONE's parts and even knew the directorial notes in the script from memory. He attended every meeting, and stayed for every party. He stuck around for every day of shooting long after his role was wrapped and he was no longer being paid. He came to see some of us in our local theater shows and supported us like we were his family. He never acted the star, and he never gave any hint that he was more important than anyone else.\n\nI dont have any cool anecdotes or stories where he touched me on the shoulder and I was illuminated and inspired. I can only tell you that he was a very loving man who loved everyone he crossed paths with in a very real way. If you knew him for five minutes, he made you feel like you knew him for a thousand years. We worked together for just a few weeks a long, long time ago and I never ever spoke with him again.\n\nBut I will always consider him my friend. Because that's how he made everyone feel. Rest in peace, dear friend.\n",

    "postText": "This is for a personal project, I'm not in school or anything. I'm particularly interested in addiction and alcoholism in women in pre-code film. I'm interested in essays, blog posts, articles, etc. on this topic. I did find my copy of the book Complicated Women, so I'll be looking through that to see if it is addressed in depth as well.\n\nAlso, if you don't have any essay recommendations but want to share your favorite film on the subject, please do.  Right now the only film I can really think of in this theme is Three on a Match (1932). I'm not as interested in propaganda film, but I'll take all suggestions. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Your parameters of pre-code, woman lead, and not a propaganda film, make this a tough ask. It was a time when women were not represented, nor were uncomfortable topics like addiction. I'm not sure a pre-1935 movie about female addiction exists unless it's propaganda.\n\nYou'd be better off using more modern examples from mid-century and reversing your thesis to the \"lack thereof\" during that time, compare pre-code drug propaganda to Modernism like Requiem for a Dream. Maybe using A Star is Born, Sunset Boulevard or Hitchcock's Notorious as stepping stones between eras.",

I was just hoping to find another like it. Check out Three on a Match, Ann Dvorak's character has a fall from grace that includes drugs &amp; alcohol and is not propaganda. It's hard to find, it's not streaming anywhere, I believe you'd have to purchase a physical copy (I own it on VHS...yes VHS). \n\nBut I appreciate your other suggestions! A focus on the lack thereof of that time is a good idea.",

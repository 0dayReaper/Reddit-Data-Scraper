I now see the Wick films as spiritual successors to Constantine.\n\n- single, lonely, brooding man\n\n- damn good at his job\n\n- well dressed\n\n- hints at a huge underground society. World building.\n\n- walks through underground club with great music and lighting.\n\nWhat other parallels did you notice? Have the John Wick producers acknowledged this inspiration?",

Then his old stunt man from The Matrix called him and asked for a favor.  So they met and talked about this movie called \"Scorn\".  During press for the film Keanu repeatedly called the film \"John Wick\" because he hated the name Scorn, it stuck so they changed the title.  Then that one movie he did as a favor ended up making a crazy amount of money for almost no budget.  So Lionsgate fast tracked the next two.  They were so belligerent about keeping Wick going that they killed Keanu's MCU role as Yon-Rogg.  He got the call while he was at Marvel about to sign the contract.",

Not that Reeves is a bad actor, but he should have never considered this role and should have passed. I would have preferred it to be given to a British actor, or at least someone from that region and it still makes me angry. Glad we got Matt Ryan and I was glad he got to come back in animation,  and hope he gets to come back in live action too, got my fingers crossed.",

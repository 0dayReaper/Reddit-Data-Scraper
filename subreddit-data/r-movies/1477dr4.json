    "postText": "As I know, recently, almost all movie theaters have closed captioning devices which is great news for disability people like me. Until today, I bought a ticket online and went to this movie theater to watch Transformers. I went up to the front and asked for closed captioning device. Guess what? All 5 or so devices weren\u2019t charged. None. It\u2019s pretty frustrating when I want to watch the movie and now I have to wait for another day to watch. Disappointed.\n\nEdit: They gave me 2 free tickets and promised the devices will be charged. I guess I can\u2019t complain",

These things (and closed captioning at home) really are great.",

One of the versions is OC \"Open Captioned\".  The open captioned version requires the theatre manager / projectionist to ingest a secondary file to compliment the CC \"Closed Captioned\" version so it will project the descriptive text and dialogue along the bottom of the screen.   It also requires a different decryption key from the standard CC version.   It's not very hard at all to setup, its just that the current ADA requirements do not call for Open Captions only closed captions.   I'm a theatre owner, so I deal with the technical side of movies on a daily basis.",

The problem is that many people will not attend a screening with closed captioned subtitles (in English speaking countries). Many say they will, but sessions with CC generally don\u2019t sell well (unless there is a large deaf community in the area).\n\nBecause of this, CC sessions often get pushed to play during the weekday, limiting the amount of people who can attend these sessions. So the exhibitors and distributions can point to this and say \u201cit\u2019s not worth running these sessions\u201d, so the emphasis is put on the closed caption devices for single users.\n\nAdmittingly it\u2019s a shitty thing that this theatre let down this particular moviegoer. From the business side of things, you can get caught on the backfoot as those devices are expensive (so cinemas only buy as many as they think they can get away with). It\u2019s a shame when access is infringed by commercial costs\n\n(Knowledge coming from 17 years of working in Cinemas both as a manager and projectionist and some training as a sign language interpreter).",

Closed caption is what allows those devices to work separately from subtitles on the image projected itself. Almost every major studio release has CC, because that's a separate track that works with individual devices (that often you stick in cupholders). A lot of them do also have OC, but those are the ones that are more \"niche\" and reduced show times, if any at all. \n\nA lot of the general public do not like the subtitles on screen. Almost every screening you go to - especially with a big release - is going to have closed captioning.\n\nWhat gets frustrating as a theater is - we're required by law to provide closed captioning devices (which is good!), but studios are not required to provide closed captioning files.",

Having to look down to your lap to read the subtitles and then back up at the screen gets old very quickly - you'll miss out on important details and possibly get eye/neck strain from constantly switching your viewing position multiple times a minute.\n\nB. Phone screens emit a lot of light, even at almost zero brightness, and are a big distraction to the rest of the audience.\n\nI've tested a pair of subtitle glasses before (different industry, same tech) and while they aren't perfect, they definitely are a step up from looking at your phone the whole time. Burned-in subtitles are honestly the most user-friendly option, having one subtitle screening a day for popular movies seems like a no-brainer. (Fun fact, my venue also carries glasses that give a video ASL \"subtitle\" for the performance, it's not perfect but a great alternative for Deaf people!)",

I accidentally went to a close caption screening recently, because it was a mid-day Saturday showing, and that\u2019s when I like going to the movies. I\u2019m using the AMC app, and it\u2019s pretty clear, and most movies have the option in my area. The subtitles were very clear and easy to read, and I\u2019m one of those people that likes subtitles. Also I am so sorry this happened to you. It\u2019s so completely and absolutely inappropriate, and you are in the right to be furious. Honesty, free tickets are not enough compensation, because you have a right to access whenever you want it and fuck your theater. I\u2019m angry on your behalf.",

Part of it was the units didn't get used enough to keep the staff well trained on how to check them in and out. We only had 3-4 regular users, and they typically only came to the movies at times when it was mostly managers working.\n\nOne thing I did with all employees is take them into the auditorium with the CC units, as well as the headsets, so they could see how everything worked. This way they could operate the equipment and explain it. We also tried to have employees to into the auditorium to test the CC and the descriptive narration on every movie so we could be sure it worked.\n\nWe did try to build a following for doing open captioning showings, but it never took off. But this was a small town 5 screen theatre, so it was tough.",

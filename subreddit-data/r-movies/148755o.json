    "postText": "I really like horror movies. I\u2019ve seen all the classics, and have hit a wall with movies that are supposedly horror movies, but not scary whatsoever. \nBut tonight I watched the first paranormal activity movie.. wow. These movies came out when I was in elementary school so I was never allowed to watch them. And DAMN, I was scared! It\u2019s the kind of horror movie where I almost feel like I need to go pray afterwards.\n\nI\u2019m always open to horror movie suggestions.\n\nHere are my favorites that I found genuinely scary/disturbing\n1. Hereditary \n2. Sinister\n3. Dark Skies (my first horror movie, I was 12 and it scarred me)\n4. The Shining\n5. Halloween (1978)\n7. Child\u2019s Play\n8. All of the conjuring + Annabelle movies \n9. Insidious \n10. The Exorcist \n11. The omen \n12. Children of the corn (1984)\n13. Midsommar\n14. Barbarian\n15. The Vvitch\n\n\nMovies I had high hopes for\u2026\n1. Ouija \n2. The Ring\n3. Nightmare on Elm Street\n4. All the Halloween movies that followed the first one \n5. The Nun",

If Paranormal Activity is the first movie you watched of its type it can be seen as scary but really it's hard to relate to the characters. They keep pushing their luck so it begins to feel formulaic.\n\nBut in Blair Witch they're young and dumb so it does feel much more real. When you're that young you're pushing your \"limits\" rather than your luck and you don't expect things to go so sideways from making such simple decisions. The scary part is you could see yourself reacting the way they are meaning you could very well be screwed if it were you.\n\nAlso it's all about keeping tensions high the whole time and not be like a rollercoaster with a jumpscare which always follows a lowering of tension, repeat until the movie ends, honestly like a... movie for something that is supposed to feel real.",

When it does, the solution is just to run away until it catches up again later. It feels far too restricted with its slow movement, limited resources, and middling intelligence. \n\nThe only scene that actually scared me any was the beach shack. The rest felt underwhelming. I did feel like it was a great depiction of how to describe the feeling of anxiety to someone, though.",

Ju On is the original version of The Grudge. \n\nHereditary is the scariest film made to date. Many people will talk shit about it but it is fantastic if you are the type to immerse yourself in a film as much as possible. I see it in your list but wanted to point out it doesnt get scarier in my opinion.\n\nThe Forgotten was a pretty bad movie overall but had one scene that genuinely gave me a pretty great chill. \n\nJeepers Creepers and Joy Ride were enjoyable when I was a teenager. \n\n28 Days Later can be pretty scary on your first watch if its late at night and you are alone.\n\nEvent Horizon is a wild ride and super fun if you enjoy dark space horror.\n\nAnd the scariest movie for me from my childhood is Candyman (1992)",

I hadn't really seen that contrast done before, at least not to this extent, and thought it was executed brilliantly. Just adds a new dimension of horror for me.\n\n\\- The movie feels so real. There is nothing supernatural about it. Everything that is happening is perfectly possible (in theory). Just feels like a real situation, so there is no reason to suspend belief. As a result, and being a college student myself, I felt like I was there, part of the group of anthropologists.\n\n\\- The opening scenes set up the film so well. It creates a palpable tension that gets under your skin and almost makes you feel like throwing up, not knowing when the it will get too much, when exactly the bubble will burst.\n\nI don't know of many other movies in the genre that have executed these elements so brilliantly as Midsommar imo, and they are just a few aspects of why it is so scary to me.\n\n\\+ I guess I didn't really find it predictable? I mean, not any more predictable than other horror movies lol. On top of that though, I don't think a movie being predictable necessarily makes it bad. Tons of predictable but great movies out there haha.",

                    "comment": "&gt;Terrifier 2\n\nThis movie is way too long, but there are 3 scenes which I really appreciated (Laundromat, Halloween store, Bedroom). The first 2 are so delightfully creepy it's almost unbelievable and the last is *incredibly* shocking. I had to take a break so I could  collect myself after such sadism.\n\nI also admire how much money they made from a sub-million dollar budget. The villain is very memorable and I'm looking forward to the inevitable sequel and all its improvements.",

            "comment": "There's no such thing as a movie that's scary.  They're all just movies, so I mean how much does it scare you, really?\n\nI actually used to and watch a lot of horror films, from the big-budget ones to the B-movies that used to be a lot of what was on Netflux years ago before they really took off.  Most of the big budget ones are actually just as bad only they are more disappointing since they are, well, big-budget movies.\n\nI think I stopped being \"scared\" of \"scary movies\" when I was in my late 20s/early 30s or so?  So not exactly when I was young but eventually you just realise they are movies.  If they scare you, you're probably still a kid lol.  I try to watch them now at home, alone, in the dark, to try to get some more \"scare\" out of them...but that doesn't really help much in making them any \"scarier\".  A *lot* of these movies are downright terrible especially when they rely on some paranormal/ghost/boogeyman, etc. kind of mumbo jumbo that is simply stupid and laughable.  I much prefer movies where there's a real explanation--a real bad guy/killer, some real explanation behind what happened, not just \"oh it's the spirit of this or that, people died here, etc.\"  \ud83d\ude44\n\nI dunno how you found Paranormal Activity scary, that movie is so bad it's...I mean it's just *bad* IMO.  But whatever floats your boat (or scares you into hiding under a tarp on the boat lol)!",

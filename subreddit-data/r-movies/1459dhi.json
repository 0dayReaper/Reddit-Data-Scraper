It's about recognizing the true owners of the land and offering them fair compensation derived from taxation of extracted resources or land taxes.\n\nA recent example of this is the Treaty 8 nations around Fort St. John, a very resource rich area. They had a signed Treaty for over 100 years, but it went unrecognized by the government. In April they were provided [$800 million in compensation](https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/bc-federal-government-settlement-first-nations).",

Because it turns out Kevin Costner had learnt phrases from a woman and so when he spoke through the movie it was always using women\u2019s phraseology and it sounded ridiculous.\n\nSo now whenever I see the Lakota get mentioned I can\u2019t help but think of my old music teacher and his stories from 20+ years ago.",

    "postText": "I don't know if this has already been talked about as I'm pretty sure I can't be the only one who noticed it but I'm sharing my observation anyways. \n\nI found too many stuff that are reminiscent of things I commonly see in videogames (mainly older ones). The flat delivery of lines from the characters, the indifference of the extras to the violence going on around them as if they're NPCs, all the way to Wick being seemingly invincible to things that have killed many of his enemies instantly.\n\nEven the way the action scenes are setup, Wick looks like he's going through a level, going from one battle section to the next. The enemies seem to appear out of nowhere and weirdly stay in plain sight during a gun fight. The set pieces are ridiculous as well, not that unrealistic fight scenes are uncommon.\n\nI watched the 1st one a long time ago and only remember the premise of him seeking revenge for his dog(?) But is the whole series like this? Curious what others think.",

The director was very proud of that. I took the showdown in the traffic to be like a stage from Super Smash Bros. lol. Having John face off against the stage boss in each act...I mean its kind of silly with the \"villains\" they had in this installment. I kept thinking with how excessive and over the top the films have been, may as well just make it a video game series, instead of these long drawn out movies.",

Nor was he ever truly outside \"the\" Matrix, but rather within a seemingly endless series of matrices. But the Architect continues to wipe his memory every time he thinks he's won, putting him (and Morpheus/The Bowery King) in different video game environments (e.g., cursing him to fight waves upon waves of deadly assassins (agents)), if only to keep him busy for as long as he [virtually] can...!&lt;",

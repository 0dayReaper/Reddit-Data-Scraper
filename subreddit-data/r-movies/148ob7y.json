What he meant was characters in the movie are Narcissists that behave way over their head. What movie made you feel that way? \n\nGone Girl is a movie that I could think off. Any movies made you feel that way?",

Doesn't ruin the movies, but there always gets to be a point where some reveal happens and i just roll my eyes at how clever we're supposed to find it.  The Dark Knight Rises is probably the worst offeneder if i have to pick just one.",

Most of his films remind me of the B students in high school who thought they were deep and said they could get A's but they didn't feel like studying. My pick would be Inception, but I haven't seen Dark Knight Rises.\n\nThe one exception for me is Memento which I've seen three times and will probably return to. A half-exception might be Interstellar, which I did enjoy, but so far haven't felt that it would repay a second viewing. If he'd eliminated the draggy middle section with Matt Damon, I think it would have been a tighter movie.",

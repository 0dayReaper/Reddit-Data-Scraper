Under Baxter\u2019s protection, Bella is eager to learn. Hungry for the worldliness she is lacking, Bella runs off with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a slick and debauched lawyer, on a whirlwind adventure across the continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella grows steadfast in her purpose to stand for equality and liberation.\n\n[Trailer](https://youtu.be/RlbR5N6veqw)",

The effect of \u201cis that an AI picture\u201d is happening to people because we are now seeing inordinate amounts of AI pictures on Reddit and online generally. It\u2019s like watching a trippy video, the visual effects seem to liger a little bit or you\u2019re looking for them in the pictures you look at after.\n\nNot everything is AI-influenced. Like someone else said, surrealism has been around for a long, long time. Attributing more old-school surrealism to AI photo generators, which have literally just come about in the last few years, seems silly. And takes away from creativity of artists. The AI engines are looking at artists work, and spitting out amalgamations. \n\nNot to mention, a lot of artists don\u2019t like AI *because* it\u2019s literally stealing ideas and churning them out en masse. It\u2019s our own perception and AI inundation on the internet that makes us attribute anything slightly unreal or straight up surreal\u2014or even sometimes real pictures\u2014to AI. Working artists are probably using AI very, very, very little, if at all. People take pride in their work. AI is kind of ruining that and stealing credit. \u201cHe probably didn\u2019t think that up, he just stole that from AI\u201d is so sadly ironic.",

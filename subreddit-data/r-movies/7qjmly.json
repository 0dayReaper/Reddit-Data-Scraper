[Newsweek however confirms that The Emoji Movie was indeed the first film screened.](http://www.newsweek.com/saudi-arabia-screens-emoji-film-one-worst-movies-2017-after-35-year-cinema-ban-781188)\n\n2) Just to be clear movies weren't banned, cinemas were banned. Also the government does plan to censor any \"objectionable\" material from any films. (Cue jokes about censoring entire Emoji Movie) ",

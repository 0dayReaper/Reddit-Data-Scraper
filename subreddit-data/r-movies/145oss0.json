(For a number of reasons, as Terry English supposedly discovered, aluminium would be a poor choice for Medieval armour.)  Looks nice, though.  You can even tell it's aluminium because of the distinct sounds it makes.  While watching the movie, my friend commented on the \"constant sound of plastic\".  I said, \"That's the sound aluminium makes.\" Steel has a [higher-pitched, tinny sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCvOC2VwDc) that you don't hear in the film.  Aluminium's also quieter haha, but doesn't sound *right*.",

It captures the Medieval voice better than any modern author, including, no offense, even *Excalibur*'s script.  And, it's completely sincere.  Not cynical about chivalry.\n\nIf they could adapt it as written, it could be the best.",

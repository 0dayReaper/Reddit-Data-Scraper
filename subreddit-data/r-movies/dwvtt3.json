Most of his movies have been relatively low budget and R rated, but his movies are making marvel levels of money.  Dude must be loaded now.  It'll be interesting to see what he makes next cause I'm sure WB will give him complete control over anything at this point.",

You remember high school theater/drama kids? You ever seen the adult version of that? I have. Very very strange people. \n\nBecoming a Hollywood actor mostly comes down to luck and/or previous connections. Nothing to do with talent and appearance. 95% of the actors you see and know right now had family in the business or some other \"in\" to the industry. \n\nWho are the big up and comers right now? Timothy Chalamet? Chalamet's maternal uncle is filmmaker\u00a0[Rodman Flender](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodman_Flender), his maternal aunt is television producer and writer\u00a0[Amy Lippman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Lippman), his maternal grandfather was screenwriter Harold Flender, and his maternal grandmother, Enid Flender (n\u00e9e Rodman), is a former Broadway dancer.[](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth%C3%A9e_Chalamet#cite_note-GQ-7)\n\n \nLucas Hedges? Second child of poet and actress Susan Bruce (n\u00e9e Titman) and screenwriter and director\u00a0[Peter Hedges](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hedges). \n\nDakota Johnson? Her dad is Don Johnson. \n\nMaya Hawk? Her mother and father are Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawk. \n\nZendaya? Zendaya, whose name derives from the Shona name Tendai, meaning \"to give thanks\",[5] grew as a performer in part at the nearby California Shakespeare Theater in Orinda, California, where her mother works as the house manager.\n\n Can't think of anybody else young and coming up but check their wiki and its almost a guarantee. [Look at \"last gens\" version of this. ](https://amp.businessinsider.com/celebrities-with-famous-parents-nepotism-in-hollywood-2012-5#aoh=15738733782356&amp;csi=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s)\n\nThe best way to get into Hollywood as a nobody with no connections is stand up comedy I would say. And for women modeling too. \n\nGoing to acting school and trying out for random auditions is futile for the most part. Correct me if im wrong. \n\nNo connections? Look at somebody like Chris Pratt. All luck. Guy was a waiter at Bubba Gumps and happened to wait on somebody making a low budget film. She casted him and he took off from there. If he was assigned a different table that day nobody would know who he is right now.",

It really shows if you know what to look for. They constantly re-use environments, character meshes, and other assets. They usually write their movies to take place in a relatively small number of environments (around 3). There are often many background characters that are basically palette swaps of one character.\n\nNone of this makes for an inherently bad movie. But it can be creatively limiting, and starts to feel very same-y after you've seen just a few of their movies.",

Both the movie and the country feature a garbage strike, so there\u2019s trash literally everywhere.

The movie got good reviews, won a Golden Lion, now grossing 1B and now the last thing it needs is a Oscar Nomination.",

The director had an idea of Taxi Driver inspired Joker and he was held back by previous movies or future movies or franchises.\n\nI think this movie was an accident and was pitched at the right time for DC to try something else since everything failed before and it was a why not type of deal, but hopefully there are people smart enough to know that this could be their ticket to future success.",

The film is a feast for the eyes and Joaquin Phoenix lays on a tip-top performance.\n\nObviously, with background Batman knowledge your understanding of what you\u2019re experiencing will be embellished. I recommend watching the film straight away and decide if and how you decide to research into the Batman universe. \n\nI\u2019m sure you will dig deeper. Then you can enjoy revisiting the film almost as if it were a new film.",

But people in 2019 responded and related to compassion for those with mental illness, feeling outcast, societal frustrations, and understanding his breaking point and violence is cautionary. We're seeing the mask/facepaint used all over the world in protests and solidarity for people feeling oppressed. Nobody turning against eachother. Truly feel many critics who didn't know what this movie was trying to say missed something important and fairly obvious in modern contexts, let their cynisism and fear of 'what could happen' cloud the way it actually plays. Got what it fucking deserved.",

    "postText": "I don't know if anyone has a technical answer in this, but I fee when I watch something from a streaming service like Netflix or Disney+, it seems the quality isn't nearly as good as when I watch a movie I purchased through Microsoft \"TV &amp; Movies.\" If you're not familiar, it's basically buying/renting movies and shows through the XBox Store.\n\nObviously I can watch Avatar 2 via Disney+ for free, but for something this cinematic, I think I'll just pay $20 to purchase it through the XBox store and watch it via the \"TV &amp; Movies \" app. With Netflix, I have the UHD subscription plan (only $10/mo thru T-Mobile), and it seems to be the same marginal quality. Especially for dark or black scenes, where you can see large pixelation. And I have \"Gigablast\" internet, so it's pretty fast and I typically have zero lag with anything.\n\nThanks for any inputs in advance.",

There will be some bits you REALLY LIKE.\n\nThen you see the movie and...some of those scenes and ideas are in there, some aren't. And that's a let-down. And some things you had a strong vision of...wont' be like that in the movie.\n\nSo the movie can only ever be AS GOOD as the book and in other places will let you down.\n\nIf you watch the movie first, then when you read the book it's like HOLY SHIT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE! The book just gives you MORE of whatever you liked about the movie.\n\nI think it only works in one direction.",

That was a huge problem with the original Dune movie IMO, it made no sense if you hadn\u2019t read the book. \n\nJust the stuff Paul was saying in the trailer is instantly recognizable as the Bene Gesserit litany against fear. That being in the trailer really sets the tone for the movie but without reading the book you don\u2019t know what it is or means.",

The Atreides are only in a handful of cities which would be very easy to nuke without harming the production of spice out in the desert, &gt;!especially when the Fremen are able to provide so much to the Spacing Guild to keep them from observing the planet.!&lt; The Harkonnens don't nuke the Atreides because such a blatant violation of the Great Convention would lead the Landsraad to destroy Giedi Prime with support from the Emperor, &gt;!despite the Emperors support of the destruction of the Atreides.!&lt;",

That's one of Leto II's revelations when he becomes a Kwisatz Haderach - that turning the planet green will cause an irrevocable collapse of the desert ecosystem and drive the worms extinct, despite the best efforts of the fremen to preserve sections of the deep desert. One of the first things he does after putting on the sand trout skin is to destroy the water farms.\n\nAnd IIRC by that time already people were noticing that worms were becoming less common, particularly the giant old men of the deep desert. \n\nIn any case, it wasn't a disaster so much as the intended outcome that had the unintended consequence of killing *all* the worms instead of a lot of them.",

Found the part in my ebook, it's from Dune Messiah (spoilers ahead, obviously):\n\n&gt;\u201cStilgar,\u201d Paul said, \u201cyou urgently need a sense of balance which can come only from an understanding of long-term effects. What little information we have about the old times, the pittance of data which the Butlerians left us, Korba has brought it for you. Start with the Genghis Khan.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cGenghis \u2026 Khan? Was he of the Sardaukar, m\u2019Lord?\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cOh, long before that. He killed \u2026 perhaps four million.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cHe must\u2019ve had formidable weaponry to kill that many, Sire. Lasbeams, perhaps, or \u2026\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cHe didn\u2019t kill them himself, Stil. He killed the way I kill, by sending out his legions. There\u2019s another emperor I want you to note in passing\u2014a Hitler. He killed more than six million. Pretty good for those days.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cKilled \u2026 by his legions?\u201d Stilgar asked.\n\n&gt;\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cNot very impressive statistics, m\u2019Lord.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cVery good, Stil.\u201d Paul glanced at the reels in Korba\u2019s hands. Korba stood with them as though he wished he could drop them and flee. \u201cStatistics: at a conservative estimate, I\u2019ve killed sixty-one billion, sterilized ninety planets, completely demoralized five hundred others. I\u2019ve wiped out the followers of forty religions which had existed since\u2014\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cUnbelievers!\u201d Korba protested. \u201cUnbelievers all!\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cNo,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBelievers.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cMy Liege makes a joke,\u201d Korba said, voice trembling. \u201cThe Jihad has brought ten thousand worlds into the shining light of\u2014\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cInto the darkness,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be a hundred generations recovering from Muad\u2019Dib\u2019s Jihad. I find it hard to imagine that anyone will ever surpass this.\u201d A barking laugh erupted from his throat.",

Notice that the first card states \"From Director Denis Villeneuve\" and not \"From The Director Of Sicario And Arrival\" like I thought they would.\n\nDenis Villeneuve is becoming a well-known mainstream director and I'm happy for him. He definitely deserves it.\n\nedit: I didn't mention Blade Runner 2049 because it wasn't a commercial hit. It's my favorite movie from Denis, but I think general audiences are not as familiar with it the same way they are with Sicario and Arrival. Maybe it was more successful on VOD than on the big screen, but AFAIK we don't have te VOD stats.",

Messiah is a short read, and quite adaptable, and it almost feels more like an epilogue to the first book instead of a full sequel. It is, in my opinion, required reading to truly understand the message that Herbert wanted to send with *Dune.*\n\nAfter that though, I'm not super confident that they'd continue on. *Children of Dune* is a possibility if the franchise gets majorly popular, especially because it continues the stories of all the characters from the first book. But after that, you hit *God Emperor of Dune,* and that's where things start getting weird. \n\nI don't see any way that God Emperor could possibly be adapted while retaining any sort of appeal for general audiences. At best, a TV series would be a better bet for that book, told from a different POV than in the novel.\n\nAfter that you get to *Heretics* and *Chapterhouse*, which take place thousands of years in the future, so they're largely unconnected to the first few books. Very, very small chance we get movies of these. Unless Dune reaches Star Wars/LOTR levels of popularity, I just don't see it happening.",

It's hard to even explain.\n\nIn the movie I'm Not There, they used like fucking TEN actors, mostly big names. And most of them didn't quite hit the mark.\n\nIf you see footage of Bob Dylan in 1966 and compare it to footage from 1969, you'll see why. Like a different human, with different mannerisms, music, and voice. He himself is an act. Seriously, go look at 1966 YouTube video of Dylan, then a 1969 video. He basically changed every single year from the start into the late 70s\n\nBeing part of the Dylan reddit  community, we're all cautiously wondering what will happen. The last person to do 1965-1966 Bob Dylan (his most iconic era when he went electric, was on meth and and all this crazy stuff) was Cate  Blanchett. Was definitely cool and  interesting, but not very accurate.\n\nChristian Bale didn't do well at all. Heath Ledger nailed his small part. Ben Wishaw, and amazing actor, was a bit off too. All these great actors.\n\nTimothee seems like he's really diving into the role. He was seen reading Tarantula, which an *insane* book of free form poetry Dylan made around 65-66 while on tons of drugs. It's not even readable. But he seems to want to dive in.\n\nIf he nails Dylan, he can pretty much do anything. He'll be the next big A list character that brings people into just by name alone.\n\nBut as a Dylan fan, I just hope it gets people into his story. Everyone thinking Dylan is just some folksy guy is a bit funny, when he only did that protest music for like 3 years of his long, long career.\n\nEdit: For a quick look into the era that he's portraying, watch this little live snippet. Part of a song, And some dialogue\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-AN2rfP6Wcc",

The reason it matters is that the desert produces a magical drug that gives people weird psychic abilities, including the power to plot hyperspace jumps for spaceships. The \"spice\" is the sole resource that makes the interstellar empire possible. Whoever runs the planet is insanely wealthy and important, so the guy being kicked out and replaced by the Duke really resents it, and plots revenge so he can have his awful awesome planet back. Storyline ensues.\n\nEdit: Oops I included a spoiler. Edited",

He knows what he's doing. I still can't even describe Arrival to people who haven't seen it. On paper it sounds pretty cut and dry, but, man, watching it is a whole other story. I felt so bizarre watching it, and I told folks \"it felt very alien\". It sounds so stupid, but when you see it, you'll understand what it means. Love that fucking movie. \n\nSo, yeah, I've got no reason to think this will be crap.",

The republic-era Jedi are trained to abstain from emotion, from falling in love, from becoming attached etc. I think since Luke was successfully trained to (here comes the cheesy bit) use the love he had for his father to defeat the evil that made him darth Vader . Then Luke tried to train the Jedi in the old way with his school, suppressing everything and being above emotion. It was unnatural and broke Ben Solo. Now Luke sees he has to close the book on the outdated thinking of the Jedi. He has to be the true opponent of the Sith. The Jedi have to be no more to make room for something else. Something better.",

He was a whiny bitch.\" The thing is, he is not an all powerful Sith Lord. He is a young, hot-headed kid with extraordinary force ability. He clearly has no control over his temper, and I think TFA goes out of its way to show that.\n\nWhat I cannot wait for is to see what Ren becomes by episode nine.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWhile several people have pointed out that Ren is not a Sith (which admittedly I didn't really even think about), those were my friend's words.",

You can hear Leia say, \"Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi,\" Yoda say, \"It binds us...\" and hear Darth Vader breathing. It's pretty neat because they come up as those images are fading in and out. ",

            "comment": "All the best Jedi have been more attuned to the shades of gray in the force and universe. All the Jedi who have suffered the greatest failures have been strict adherents to the philosophy. \n\nQui Gon for example believed in the living force more than any adherence to the council or their rules. And while some of that got into Obi Wan... he still was far more fervent than his master. And failed miserably because of it. Only after decades of being alone and communing with Qui Gon did he become \"Old Ben\" who was a much more capable, and much grayer, force user. \n\nBy comparison, the members of the council all failed to see the Sith threat despite it being right in front of them. They also failed to see how it has corrupted Annakin until it was too late. And to a man they paid for it with their lives. With the exception of Yoda whose failure was arguably the greatest. He outlived Obi Wan yet from this perspective he was taking direction and advice from Kenobe during Empire Strikes Back... not the other way around. He trained Luke despite his misgivings because Obi Wan (and arguably Qui Gon) insisted. He still did not connect with the living force the way that Obi Wan and Qui Gon were able to until the very end when he joined them. \n\nThe best Jedi from the video games and extended universe all tended to be failures and outcasts by conventional Jedi Order standards. And the flipside of this, one could argue, found Maul as an outcast from the Sith yet still enormously resilient and successful as a force user (until he finally meets up with Kenobi again of course). \n\nI really like the idea of force users casting off the strict adherence to dogma and stepping into a more morally gray universe. The commentary would seem to be that any sort of religious zealotry is bad. Accepting that some things are unknowable and that morality is not black and white would go a long way towards grounding the mythos. The three prequels made it seem like the Jedi had helped run a galaxy that was nigh paradise for thousands of years. Yet the more we learned about the reality of that world we saw slavery, injustice, criminality, and all manner of bad things that were right below the surface of that patina of \"good\" all along. Making it seem like the Jedi were not in fact being fooled by the Sith or even the force itself but in fact were fooling themselves. The jedi who saw through this to the reality of the world they lived in were far wiser and intuitive but also less successful in their career as Jedi since their insight ran afoul of the Jedi Order's dogma. \n\nLuke, accepting that he had done things wrong in the beginning is super interesting. He tried to create the Jedi order. Something that was corrupt and failed at bringing light to the galaxy. And so the product of his efforts was corrupt. And created only corruption. So the failure isn't just his, it's Yoda's as well as his Master. And the idea that now, Luke has seen beyond the Jedi Order to something greater and more important is pretty exciting. \n\nBecause all the best force users were not by Order standards, very good Jedi.

But I needed those students real bad and I had to give 'em up just to get Ben Solo off my back. \nSo now we're gonna have to go get more. And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Rey. And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about 'em, Rey. Because the world is full of Stormtroopers that don't understand what's important. And they'll tear us apart, Rey. But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Rey. And you're gonna be a part of 'em. And together we're gonna run around, Rey, we're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Rey. Just you and me, Rey. \nThe outside world is our enemy, Rey. We're the only [belch] friends we've got, Rey. It's just Luke and Rey. Luke and Rey and their adventures, Rey. Luke and Rey, forever and forever, a hundred years Luke and Rey, s... things. Me and Luke and Rey runnin' around and Luke and Rey time. Aaall day long forever. All, a hundred days Luke and Rey forever a hundred times. Over and over Luke and Rey adventures dot com W W W dot Luke and Rey dot com W W W Luke and Rey adventures all hundred years. Every minute Luke and Rey dot com W W W hundred times Luke and Rey dot com.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold \u2764\ufe0f",

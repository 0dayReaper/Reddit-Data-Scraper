Then they kill a swan, make the kid go out into a lake to get it and bring it back, cut off its wings, tape/glue then to the kid, force him to climb a tree and jump from the top while pointing a bb gun at him.!&lt;\n\nSo definitely a bit messed up. I might've gotten the order wrong, haven't read it in years.\n\nEDIT: hmmm, thought I knew how to spoiler..",

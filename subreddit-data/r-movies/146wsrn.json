Obviously the reboot is incredible and pushed special effects forward in a revelatory way.\n\nBut I'm talking about movies 2-5.\n\n1 ends with the twist that he was wrong and it was earth all along. But 2 is an insane movie about an inter-primate race war, a secret underground society of telepaths that worship a nuke and Charleton Heston deciding the destroy the world. And then the entire planet blows up.\n\n3 deals with three apes that escape via Charleton Heston's rocket and head back in time to 1970s San Francisco. It's sort of like Star Trek The Voyage Home if the Enterprise crew were monkey and they just sort of settled in San Francisco as celebrities. Eventually though, the government interrogates them and realizes humankind is going to be taken over by apes, so they murder them.\n\n4 deals with their son Caesar (see the connection?) who they hid in a circus before they died. At this point mankind is using apes for slave labor and he leads a revolt of them. In the original timeline without Caesar, this revolt creates the world ruled by apes from the first movie. But Caesar has made a few human friends at this point so he creates a society where humans and apes live in peace.\n\n5 deals with a bunch of a Mad Max type nuclear survivors who want to reinstate human supremacy and a factor of the apes who want ape supremacy as Caesar tries to keep the peace.\n\nThey're a really weird and cool time capulse of pre-Star Wars scifi and I can't recommend them enough.",

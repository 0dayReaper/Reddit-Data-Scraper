The performances were almost all good but the only real stand out was Joe Pesci. \n\nIn my mind Goodfellas walked so The Sopranos could run.",

Joe Pescis character in real life was even more sadistic and a rapist but in the movie he's just portrayed as a quirky sociopath. Same with \"Paul Cicero\".\n\nI think in attempting to make the film more palatable to Hollywood and critics he felt the need to really undermine his own goal of showing the \"real mafia\" when adapting the story.",

It shows how he and his friends lie, kill, and cheat each for a quick buck. There's no moral tapestry to explore - its style, verve, and substance. Hill loves the violence and flash, only leaves it to save his on ass, and regrets its absence. Hill refuses to grow or change and simply reacts to his circumstances. He is a supporting character in the story of someone like Michael Corleone.\n\nGodfather, on the other hand, is a period piece about succession of power in an Italian-American crime syndicate. Henry Hill would fit in the background of this film's threequel; but he wouldn't belong at the Corleone's table. This is a psychodrama about what father's (and - to a lesser extent - mother's) want for their sons and what they get from them as a result of what their sons choose to do to assume power. It is interested in the loneliness of life at the top of the mountain as a consequence of agency over time. Michael ends up alone because he chooses to trade human connection for power.\n\nThe Italian/Catholic/mob stuff is rich dressing, but is totally incidental to what drives the action of the story.",

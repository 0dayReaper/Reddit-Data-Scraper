The alleged assault, his subsequent divorce, and the death of his mother launched Fraser into a depression that, combined with his health problems, led to a pause in his career.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan\\_Fraser#Personal\\_life",

(It didn't work; but *good* news, he was clear of that after 10 years from the divorce, so he was able to actually cash his OWN checks starting in 2017!)\n\nHe also never contested the Child Support, as he did everything he could for the kids.  One of his kids, Griffin, is on the spectrum, so I'd imagine he was going to continue supporting him in any way possible.",

He alleges he was non-consensual fingered by a film executive, went public with the story in an attempt to see his molester have some form of consequences, and instead of taking his side Hollywood blacklisted him. His wife left him shortly after, prompting gossip rags to claim Brendan was gay and his molestation was actually just a homosexual affair that estranged him from his then wife, and for years he struggled through the trauma of it all. On top of that, his alimony was based on his wages before the blacklisting, and nearly bankrupted him. This film was his attempt to reclaim his love for acting, and has been a tremendous success.",

No fronting, he shows true gratitude and self-awareness. He's the complete opposite of a narcissist and he deserved all of this. As our society overall becomes more narcissistic (imo), it's people like Brenden that can show the rest of us that empathy isn't a dead emotion and you can find happiness without being selfish, even if it takes 20 years. He was perfect for the character because I get the distinct feeling he knew almost exactly what his character was going through. His character mirrored the empathy he shows in real life and it showed through beautifully. The man is a pure class act and the Brenaissance is FINALLY here!",

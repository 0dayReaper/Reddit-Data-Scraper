    "postText": "Avatar: The Way of Water\nJames Cameron returns to direct Avatar: The Way of Water, with returning performances from: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, and Michelle Yeoh. Other cast includes: Kate Winslet from Titanic, Cliff Curtis from the Meg franchise, Britain Dalton, Jack Champion from Avengers: Endgame, Bailey Bass, Filip Geljo, and Jamie Flatters.\n \nYears after Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) decided to stay on Pandora with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), they are once again threatened. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) wants to kill Sully for betraying him during the last fight for Pandora.\n \nI liked the first Avatar movie, it had action, beautiful visuals, and a touching message. Even though this film had action and beautiful scenes, I didn\u2019t like it as much as the first, due to the story being similar to the previous.\n \nJust like the last film, there is lots of action. Once again the Navi people have to leave their home for somewhere new. In doing so, they have to learn how to survive with the Metkayina clan. They teach the Navi to hold their breath underwater for long periods of time. I liked all the underwater animals. Friendship develops between Lo\u2019ak and Payakan, I found this sweet, since they are both outcasts.\n \nCinematographer Russell Clapenter and director James Cameron did an excellent job creating beautiful scenes in and out of the water. They used a technique called performance capture, which means all the underwater scenes were filmed underwater, with everyone involved having to hold their breath underwater. Since this has never been done before, I find it amazing and feel this will change how underwater scenes are filmed.\n \nThe storyline was very similar to the first Avatar. In the first movie the military wanted to use the Navi land to mine Unobtanium, in this sequel the military wanted revenge on Sully for siding with the Navi in the last movie. I found Avatar\u2019s: The Way of Water\u2019s three hours and 12 minutes unnecessarily long. Even though I didn\u2019t like this movie as much as the first, I still appreciate how beautiful it is and what it could do for Hollywood.",

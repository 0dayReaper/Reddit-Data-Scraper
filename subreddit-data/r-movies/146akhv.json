    "postText": "For best actor i would say Daniel Day-Lewis has given some of the most jawdropping performances. His characters always feel like they were made for him.\nI feel like Christian Bale has to be mentioned aswell, not necessarily for his acting skills, but for the work he puts in before shooting. His body transformation shows the insane amount of dedication he puts into his physique.\n\nFor actress i would say Uma Thurman is up there, for the Tarantino movies. She really sells that 80's vibe in his movies, and she was just awesome in the Kill Bill movies. Although I think Jodie Foster is a phenomenal actress where I have to mention her because of Silence of the lambs. Her performance really sold Anthony hopkins performance because of the duality they portrayed.\n\nIm excited to hear about your favorite actor/actress!",

By the time he\u2019s openly / intensely emotional, he\u2019s worked his way in through his subtlety. In any one moment he can produce multiple micro-emotions, all of them felt, all of them translate to film. To feel his presence across time and through the medium of film is always intense for me. I can only imagine the intensity of it for someone acting alongside him.",

I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about that movie for weeks. I can\u2019t wait to see what other roles he takes and what his career is like in the future.\n\nColin Farrell - I\u2019m noticing a common theme here\u2026 Colin Farrell in In Bruges was one of my favorite performances (and films) ever. I couldn\u2019t wait for Banshees of Inisherin and holy cow I was not let down, it was phenomenal and his character was hilarious and heartbreaking and beautiful. \n\nMahershala Ali - He\u2019s got this incredible presence and demeanor and I will watch anything he\u2019s in.\n\nMichelle Yeoh - I was mesmerized by her in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. And she was equally amazing in EEAAO. \n\nAmy Adams - No explanation needed really, she\u2019s just always great even when the movie itself isn\u2019t. \n\nI know I\u2019m forgetting some!",

He is a total master of the craft and elevates everything he\u2019s in. He has, rightfully, won two academy awards. He was my favorite part of Westworld S1 and the selling point for me to watch it at all. On top of all this he\u2019s a genuine class act, never heard a single negative thing about him! His instagram is a hoot!\n\nFavorite role from him: Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs.\n\nWhich leads me to my favorite actress: Jodie Foster. Another actress who started young playing against some legends. Jodie Foster is a brilliant actress and blends into any role she does. She can speak French fluently and has done her own French dubbing. Another double Oscar winner, Foster is able to bring a lot of pathos to the roles she plays (see: Nell, Contact), I am really looking forward to her in True Detective S4!\n\nFavorite role from her: Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs. (The two of them, Hopkins and Foster, interact so well you get lost in it. Hard to believe they share only a few minutes of screen time.)",

The utter fluidity at which he can change and embody new personas is honestly terrifying, and his facial ticks and twitches (which are consistent and context relevant throughout hours of footage) serve to show just how incredibly in-character he always is. It's seriously criminal this man doesn't have a Grammy. \n\nBest Performance imo: The Boys \n\n\nActress: Kim Da-mi. She is phenomenally honest in her acting. It's as if she embodies the mindset of the character completely and truly doesn't know the script. The way she can switch between emotions is crazy too, and her mastery of slight facial changes allowing her to pivot from one expression to the next is amazing. However, I think the best point of her acting is done with her eyes. She can fill them with such emotion, or drain them of their humanity entirely. It's chilling and beautiful. \n\nBest Performance imo: The Witch Part 1: Subversion",

Bee, Maigret, Black Adder, or The Devil. I just think he is awesome and he is so good at physical comedy the body language tells the story in his works and his faces and mannerism are hilarious.",

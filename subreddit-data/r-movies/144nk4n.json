Their stunt driver only hit one regular car, who agreed not to sue them as long as they used the footage in the film (which they did).",

They had NYPD (including cops that worked the real case that the film was based on) controlling traffic for 5 blocks, and were even given control of the traffic signals. \n\n But they didn\u2019t stay within the confines of their permitted filming area, taking to uncontrolled public streets. This is where the \u201cfilmed without permits\u201d claim comes from- they WERE filming with permits, until they left the are they were permitted to film in. Sort of like you\u2019re allow into Disney World if you buy a ticket, but you\u2019re trespassing if you hop a fence. \n\nAs for the guy they crashed into, they covered the cost of his car repairs and I\u2019m fairly certain *that* is the reason he didn\u2019t sue - at least from what I\u2019ve read, the director wanted to include the footage because it was great footage, not because the driver of the other car requested it.",

So they bring in Guillermo del Toro to recreate those original monsters, but then turn around and both write and market the movie for preteens.\n\nHad they made it for the correct audience (adults) and made it into an anthology of short horror stories adapted from the books, they could have easily squeezed three successful movies out of it.",

            "comment": "I don't know how I feel about this. On one hand I'm a massive Ghostbusters fan. It might be the most important movie of my childhood. But on the other hand I really did not like Afterlife. To me, it just felt like a soulless cash grab at the franchise. Very unoriginal. It kind of felt like they were just playing the hits, badly.\n\nI'm going to have to see it, even if I know it will just disappoint me, such is Ghostbusters grip on my soul. I just hope now that they are freed from making it a direct sequel to the original movie, they can do something new and interesting.",

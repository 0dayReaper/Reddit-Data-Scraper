    "postText": "I love actors and actresses who have accents. I'm a particular fan of French and British accents, though I also have a weak spot for Australians.\n\nFor actors, I'd have to pick Idris Elba. He has a masculine yet warm voice, which, combined with his accent, makes me want to listen to him all day long.\n\nFor actresses, Margot Robbie's Australian accent is irresistible. If you're a fan too, you might enjoy this interview:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6UbsF02lsQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6UbsF02lsQ)\n\nNot all accents sound good to me though. I mean personally can't stand Rosie Perez's accent.",

King Richard, Picard, Charles Xavier, he has the kind of voice of authority that people just trust\n* **Benedict Cumberbatch** \\- He has unconventional looks but a delicious sounding voice that is very versatile, from playing British Detective Sherlock, to Smaug and even sounds like he'd be a great, cold villain like in Star Trek Into Darkness.\n* **Antonio Banderas** \\- if you bottled his voice you'd have SEXY, the cologne. \\[Actually now that I think about it he's probably plugged some cologne by now?\\] The Mask of Zorro, Desperado, Puss ... in Boots.\n\nFor Actresses, it's Eva Green all the way. That scene between [her and Bond in Casino Royale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuyoqS31Yug) was 100% chemistry, and a lot of it is due to both of their accents.",

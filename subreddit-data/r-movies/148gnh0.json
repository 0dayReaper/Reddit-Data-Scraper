    "postText": "I\u2019m sort of torn with the animation style of the Spiderverse movies. It\u2019s both mesmerizing, bold, dynamic, but at the same time on the verge of giving me an aneurysm. It\u2019s overstimulating at points and feels like I need 3D glasses. Anyone feel this way? Part of the reason why I don\u2019t rewatch it as much is because it\u2019s a strain on my eyes\u2026.I feel lame lol",

            "comment": "I didn't see the first one in the cinema so the sequel was quite an experience. Definitely a sensory overload with kinetic blasting visuals and a dynamic soundscape. The budget was about 100 million and you can definitely see that on the screen.\n\nWhat impressed me was that it managed to maintain this without becoming incoherent or overbearing. (The first film had a lot more lulls in the action and flashing bright colors). I can definitely see why people would have a love/hate reaction to it. But for me they somehow managed to balance it despite being like a two hour long fireworks show.",

Even at home, I basically keep sunglasses near my couch incase a show or movie has strobe lights lol.\n\nBut that art style? So good. It just sucks that it hurts me to watch",

How all the lifetimes connect with slight differences. Like there\u2019s just so little words that can describe the emotion I get from the ending. I know Leto has kind of went a weird path acting wise but man is this movie phenomenal.",

            "comment": "One of those films that I relate to in a whole new way every time I watch it. \n\nI feel like there are two conflicting major themes that don't necessarily agree with each other, and at different points in my life I've been drawn to one or the other.\n\nThe first is what he expresses as the old man quoting Tennessee Williams. \n\n\"All of those lives, which one is the right one?\" \n\n\"Each of these lives is the right one. Every path is the right path. Everything could have been anything else and it would have just as much meaning.\"\n\nThe second theme that is hard to reconcile with that is that of love being the ultimate meaning of life, culminating in his ultimately making a choice and waiting to be reunited with his true love. All of the lives had meaning, but in that one he found real happiness and love that many of his other lives seemed to lack.",

His nine year old self couldn\u2019t make the decision to go with his mom or dad. But him, at the end of his life, realized the only life worth living for is that of true love.",

His big quote is to live as if you're on an adventure and to embrace the freedom you have.  It's not to get hung up on what is \"best\" because it's a meaningless distinction.  Any life is \"best\" because it is actually life.  You live and experience, you will love and lose, you will face pain, and whatever choice you make will lead to you being able to experience what it is to live.  Any choice is a good choice when you understand and embrace the playground that life is.  \n\nNemo knowing he will die declares that any way is the best way to live because life is finite and full of moments worth living for.  His wisdom is to engage with life fully, which does not necessarily involve true love, but does necessarily involve life.  It's existentialist in that life is what you make it, glass half-full, embrace the extent of your freedom to forge your future.",

When he dies of old age in 2092 he finally found the reality he wanted. He wanted to be with Anna. It delves into how a single choice, living with his mother or father expands into dozens of lives lived. Then there\u2019s the other reality that he doesn\u2019t die of old age in 2092. Every single choice has two outcomes. Those two outcomes each have another two outcomes. Continues to compound. Movie explores how every choice in life splits your life in half with possibilities. He sees every reality at once. And at the end of his life he finally made up the decision his nine year old self couldn\u2019t.",

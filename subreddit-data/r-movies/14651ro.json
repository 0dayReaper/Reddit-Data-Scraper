    "postText": "After have never watched any Rocky movies, i picked up 1-4 in the 4K steelbooks. I can say that experiencing this for the first time in full screen with remastered audio, i can say that i\u2019ve been living under a rock with these movies. The pure quality of watching number 3 with Mr. T was an experience i wish i could relive again.",

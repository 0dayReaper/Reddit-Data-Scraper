Takes a committment though - many westerns have been directly influenced by these films.\n\nSci-Fi - I am always recommending 'A Boy and His Dog' - old school but one of the best endings.\n\nBlade Runner is my personal all time favorite - the atmosphere, the characters, the whole world is so genuine feeling.  The soundtrack really makes it too.\n\nFantasy - The Labrynth was a childhood favorite that still 100% holds up - wacky but fun - David Bowie is in there doing his thing.\n\nIf you haven't seen the original 'Willow' that also holds up quite well overall.",

It's got phenomenal music, characters, action scenes, pacing, actors, and food-for-thought, making it my favorite western of all time.\n\n\\-*High Noon* (1952) - A Wild West town marshal (Gary Cooper) must organize a posse when he learns of a gang of outlaws coming into town to kill him on his retirement day at noon. It's not a shoot-'em-up movie (though there are a couple of terrific action scenes), being more of an inspiring, entertaining analysis of what makes some people so heroic and others so cowardly.\n\n\\-*Duck, You Sucker* (1971) - A Mexican bandit and an Irish revolutionary team up to rob the Mesa Verde bank, but end up involved neck-deep in the Mexican Revolution. Its political thesis couldn't be any less clear, but it's a riveting, electric tale of friendship.\n\n\\-the Man with No Name trilogy (*A Fistful of Dollars* \\[1964\\], *For a Few Dollars More* \\[1965\\], and *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly* \\[1966\\]) - Clint Eastwood stars as the gunslinging drifter the Man with No Name, shooting up bad guys and making some cash on the side, in this world-famous \"spaghetti western\" (Italian-made western) trilogy.\n\n\\-*Django* (1966) - This iconic \"spaghetti western\" is about a coffin-dragging gunslinger who finds himself in the middle of a range war between Mexican revolutionaries and racist, ex-Confederate renegades.\n\n\\-*Once Upon a Time in the West* (1968) - This probably isn't the first western you should start out with, but you definitely should work your way up to this \"spaghetti western\" epic about strangers arriving in a growing Wild West town, making bloodshed inevitable. It's pretty slowly paced, but it still manages to entertain, thanks to its intriguing narrative, music, cinematography, etc.\n\n\\-*Jeremiah Johnson* (1972) - Some guy decides to become a mountain man, in what could be the definitive mountain man western.\n\n\\-*Shane* (1953) - In one of the all-time great lone-gunslinger movies, a retired gunslinger (Alan Ladd) settles down with a homesteader family, only to find that he can't outrun his calling in life.\n\n\\-*Unforgiven* (1992) - Clint Eastwood stars in this revisionist western as a retired gunman who saddles up for one final job when he's hired to avenge the mutilation of a prostitute.\n\n\\-*Winchester '73* (1950) - James Stewart sets off on a journey to recover a prized rifle of his that was stolen. It's an excellent fusion of the psychological western and the action-adventure-western.\n\n\\-*High Plains Drifter* (1973) - Clint Eastwood plays a mysterious gunslinger who starts raising Hell in a Wild West town.\n\n\\-*The Professionals* (1966) - A team of gunslingers is organized to rescue a woman who was kidnapped by Mexican revolutionaries.\n\n\\-*Vera Cruz* (1954) - This influential action-adventure-western is about a team of gunslingers who're hired to escort a French countess across rebel-held territory in Mexico during the Franco-Mexican War.\n\n\\-*Bad Day at Black Rock* (1955) - In the film that put director John Sturges on the map (he would later direct the masterpieces *The Magnificent Seven* \\[1960\\] and *The Great Escape* \\[1963\\]), a mysterious man shows up in a teeny-tiny Western American town following World War II and starts asking a bit too many questions, prompting violence from the locals.\n\n[Anyway, if you're a newcomer to classic cinema (which you may not be), I have a Letterboxd list of classic movies that I would personally consider approachable/watchable/accessible/engaging/manageable/recommendable for somebody just getting into the classics (that I always share when this sort of question is asked). It leans heavily on the action, adventure, crime, war, and western genres at the moment, but I'm hoping to work that out in the future, as I add more films to the list. Click the \"Read notes\" button near the top of the screen to see a paragraph for each movie explaining why I chose it for the project and a one-sentence plot summary.](https://letterboxd.com/thehestinator/list/entry-level-cinema-accessible-entertaining/)\n\nGood luck!",

Probably one of the most beautifully shot films of the 20th century. Sure there\u2019s some modern issues of casting white people as Arab characters, such as Sir Alec Guinness playing Prince Faisal, but for the day it was probably one of the most fantastically cast line ups. Warning, it is almost 4 hours long. \n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) - a quirky, riveting story of British POWs building the China-Burma railway during the Second World War. A thrilling ride all the way through. Wonderfully cast, wonderfully filmed.",

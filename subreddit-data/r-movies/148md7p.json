Definitely a broader description and the more correct answer, but neither really applies unless the hidden information is used for suspenseful or ironic effect. Terms like these tend to describe the way a writer *uses* information, rather than just identifying the passive existence of undisclosed facts. Characters can be unaware of plot points, but that's not always a case of dramatic irony. They have to speak or act in a way that relates to those points.",

Most of the time they do reveal the secret near the end\u2026 after sitting through 90% of the film bewildered/wondering wtf is going on lol. \n\nBut I understand why many enjoy that suspenseful/unknowing feeling. Too intense for me tho, I like being in-the-loop \ud83d\ude01",

This concept has been adapted to film as well although changes have to be made since in film narration, unlike oral storytelling or written prose there is no implicit narrator. If you\u2019re interested, here is a pretty comprehensive summary: [Focalisation in Film](http://www.filmnarrative.com/focalisation.html)",

One I can think of is John Wick where people talk about his killing a dude with a pen or pencil and they do it in I think the second.",

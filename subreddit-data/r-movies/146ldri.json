    "postText": "Just watched it on Peacock and this is a pretty solid and entertaining movie! I liked these characters more than I thought I would. Nicholas Hoult I like as an actor in general, he's been in some good shit, and I will say for him to be the main protagonist and the titular character, is very earned. \n\nI will not say that Nicolas Cage as Dracula is the best part and carries this movie, because surprisingly that isn't the case here. I really enjoyed the time spent with the characters that have the most focus, being Renfield of course, Dracula obviously, Tedward Lobo, Rebecca. These other characters have almost as much screen time as Renfield, but they still manage to keep him as the titular protagonist and feel that way. \n\nLet me say something about Lobo....he is pretty fun and entertaining even for being such an asshole. He is in competition with Cage for that over the top personality, but it's really fun to see....and Ben Schwartz....I don't mean this in a bad way, but I pretty much just hear R rated Sonic the Hedgehog lmao especially when his voice gets high pitched....sounds EXACTLY like Sonic with that R rated edge! \n\nThe carnage-filled action is a delight although.....don't take it too seriously, because it certainly is not taking itself seriously, and the blood, a lot of it does look CGI, and sometimes it can look iffy, and other times it looks good. And if you can accept that it's not Tarantino or Evil Dead in regards to carnage being entirely practical, there is a TON of carnage candy to look forward to. It really doesn't hold back.\n\nAgain about Cage.....he really is a lot of fun and Dracula, it's a perfect role for him.  I can't even say it's Nicolas Cage being Nicolas Cage, I could see this evil undead blood-sucking villain with those Cage....isms which all work perfectly. \n\nSo yes, definitely recommend this. It's not some AAA Oscar winner, but it does have fun characters, decent story, badass carnage candy action.",

I normally can't stand Nicholas Cage's overacting, but he was actually quite enjoyable in this movie. The most surprising performance for me in this movie was Rebecca played by Awkwafina. I know of her stand up , but not familiar with her acting. I thought she killed it as the incorruptible bad ass cop with a good heart. I look forward to seeing her in more roles.",

Awkwafina was tolerable at best. The action was over the top but it was so over the top it wasn\u2019t fun, I like it to feel at least a little bit real, this was just too dumb and fake. If the carnage had looked decently realistic would have been a much better experience. I also didn\u2019t find it very funny, which was the biggest surprise to me. Lastly I thought Cage to be the only good part really of the entire film. He carried and every time he wasn\u2019t on screen, which was too much, my interest dive bombed. Schwartz wasn\u2019t bad, but the actor who played his mom was better, plus her voice is amazing always has been.\nCool to see your opinion though and how different it was from my experience",

He was verified as deceased by Dr. Van Helsing at the beginning of Dracula's Daughter. \n\nBased upon these events, you must totally ignore these earlier films....and I guess that was the point. Erase from your mind the classic films that came before and pretend they don't exist. Fine. I get it.\nIf it were me....and it's not....I would have watched the 1931 Dracula with Bela Lugosi and Dwight Frye (Renfield). There is a huge window of opportunity to expand on the original film from the point Renfield arrives at Castle Dracula, until his demise at Carfax Abbey. It would be a serious horror film in the vein (pun intended) of the Universal classics and not a horror/comedy.\n\nBela Lugosi is Dracula.\nDwight Frye is Renfield.\n\nI consider this film an opportunity wasted, but that's just my opinion.",

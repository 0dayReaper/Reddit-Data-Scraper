    "postText": "Sorry, this is a long review and perhaps choppy.\n\n\u201cFunny People\u201d may not be Apatow\u2019s funniest movie (ironically), but in terms of characters, story, acting, and themes, I think this is his best movie so far.  Not only does this movie pull the curtain back as to what it is like for some very believable stand-up characters in various stages of their careers, but it gets into deep relationship situations (romantic, plutonic, and professional) AND tackles existential crisis via mortality.\n\nSynopsis: George (Sandler) learns he is dying and hires an aspiring young comic in Ira (Rogan) to be his assistant while he takes an experimental medication to fight his newly learned terminal illness.  George wants to make amends to his ex, Laura (Mann), who\u2019s since married Clarke (Bana), the biological father of their two girls.  George still loves Laura, and they had/have a sincere connection. \n\nFirst, what a great performance given by Sandler.  He plays a slimy/flawed version of himself, and I suspect much of the dialogue in this film was ad-libbed.  The movie pokes fun at Sandler\u2019s career, showcasing how his early work is mostly juvenile humor that appeals to low-brow/young audiences.  George wakes up from his lonely existence after learning he\u2019s dying.  He reaches out to Laura to sincerely apologize for fucking up their relationship, which is like a conversation on MDMA looks like (heartfelt &amp; empathetic).  He also manipulates her later when he realizes he will probably live, by having Ira give her the news right before she sees him going standup.  He calculates his best chance at winning her back is through laughter, and he\u2019s right.\n\nAll of the characters are flawed, but in a very real, believable way but never in a defining trait kind of way.  Ira fucks over his roommate, Leo (Hill) by leaving him in the dark about the gig Ira gets as George\u2019s writer/assistant.  You can see the motivations (however wrong), and how Leo finds out is organic (as is Clarke\u2019s finding out about George and Laura).\n\nGeorge plays a song to an audience at one point, talking to them not only as George, but as any stand up\u2019s ego.  Who will they turn to for laughs when he\u2019s gone?  He doesn\u2019t want them to visit his grave, etc.  It\u2019s all said under the pretense of humor, as the audience laughs, perhaps nervously, merely because of  who he is and the setting in which he tells them.  Eminem\u2019s cameo provides fans a look into his life now, where he cannot go anywhere anymore due to his fame.  \n\nThere are scenes where you get multiple perspectives at the same time, like when George tells the dinner group at Thanksgiving that they\u2019re going to look back fondly at this meal, not because of him, but because of the excitement and temporary times of being young and spending time with friends.  The group of young comics probably agree internally, but because they are spending the holiday with a legend in their field.\n\nEven when George and Ira talk to the tall German doctor and roast him, you can see how the comedians deal with serious stuff by cracking jokes, whereas the doctor patiently and professionally tries to communicate with them despite this frustration.\n\nSome of my personal highlights within this gem are when Ira &amp; George meet up at Laura\u2019s house.  Someone explains that one of George\u2019s characters in the fake movie *Re-Do* is how he re-learns to be a man when his full sized head is swapped onto the body of a baby.  It\u2019s around this time George ALSO learns that he\u2019s getting a \u201cre-do\u201d in life because the experimental treatment is working.  \n\nThere are scenes that misdirect you by way of perspective.  Laura thinks Clarke is the same as George- fucking all the women he can and just cares about $.  By the end, you learn how badly he wants to make things work, and though he reacts with violence initially, he quickly catches himself and shows the depth of his empathy.  You see George laugh during an incredible song by Laura\u2019s daughter, which seriously moved me, but when you hear George explain why he laughs it gives you that window into his life- one where he\u2019s had such a drastically different life that he just sees things differently.\n\nSome scenes are both funny and smart.  Particularly, I loved Clarke telling Laura how surprised he is that George is actually funny IRL despite thinking his movies suck.  Also, having Laura act badly by over-acting at dinner was perfect.  You know her character didn\u2019t make it as an actor, and you get a glimpse why in that scene.\n\nFinally, the characters all end up where they should be: Laura and Clarke try and work things out for their children at least.  Ira throws away the clout he\u2019s earned in his career under George for ethical reasons.  George gets a second chance at life and after some self reflection apologizes to Ira and decides to help him.\n\nThere\u2019s more I could say but I\u2019ve already said enough (like Ira &amp; Daisy).",

Like in Funny people you really see the jealously side of the Rogan character and the Adam Sandler mortality bit is clearly Ap-atow coming to gripes with his mortality. 40 year old virgin, knocked up and this is 40 also gives you unique peaks into his life. it's a shame he's kind've wandered off being  like a for hire director now. He's the biggest victim of studios just refusing to fund R rated comedies any longer.",

            "comment": "I agree on it being an excellent film, dont let the naysayers say the nays.\n\nIts a great performance from Sandler, and i think what a lot of people didnt like about it is what I connected to - those longish, dry scenes that werent funny but were meant to show how out of place Rogan was when leaping into Sandlers world.\n\nIn another life, i had a similar\u2026working relationship/friendship. I started hanging out with a radio personality that had some clout. I became his producer and helped with a lot of bits and segments. This was an established guy who knew what he was doing. There was always a grey area where i didnt know just how much we were friends, how much we used each other, and if i was even in the same league (when youre around a true professional, you quickly see how talented they are and how serious they take their work). It was also eye opening to just how depressing that world can be, and really seedy.\n\nThis was not meant to be a funny movie (despite the cast). It was meant to be a warning, and a grim look into how the sausage is made. You want to be Sandler without going through the Rogan part, and its just not possible. The early part where Sandler has sex with one of the girls while Rogans date says she has a boyfriend, only for Sandler to then take her too is metaphorical (and echoed when Sandler steals Rogans bit later). Its a business, and an ugly one with a lot of skeletons when you get to the top.",

            "comment": "Great timing for me to find such a recent post. I just watched this movie again for the second time and came to see what reddit's opinion was. I remember liking it the first time and that was validated this time as well. I was reading through posts from 10 years ago and even on this thread that said, \" it wasn't funny\" and I can't believe after seeing the movie anyone would think it's main intent was to be funny. Yes there are funny quips and moments but that isn't the purpose. I would even say they named the movie \" Funny People\" to be ironic. I think this was made for.comedians. when life happens you cannot expect them to always be on. And you can't expect anyone who faces death to have a come to Jesus moment where they become the most grateful person in the world. Sandler did a great job of showing a real person deal with real shit. Although it was decently received when it came out, I think if it came out now at this point in his career it would have been very well received. In 2009 we expected stupid slap stick Adam still for the most part. One of hist best movies in my opinion , Rogen's too.",

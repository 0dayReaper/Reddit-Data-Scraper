    "postText": "An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn\n\nA movie about a director having a meltdown over how bad his film is because he can't put Alan Smithee on the title because his name literally is Alan Smithee could've been a fun, hilarious Hollywood satire\n\nIt was not. Instead it is just an incoherent, mostly unfunny mess that can't decide if it wants to be a mockumentary or a straight forward narrative\n\nAlso we never find out exactly why the movie was so bad that Alan wanted his name taken off it and (spoilers) ended up burning the negative.  Like how hard could it have been for the guy who wrote Showgirls to make up an intentionally bad movie?\n\nIf you want to watch a mockumentary about a movie/TV show that's intentionally bad stick to Garth Marenghi's Darkplace",

If I recall correctly it was quite literally two scripts put together, which is so lame.\n\nI cannot express how much I love the idea of a burnt-out, alcoholic Superman. I think we\u2019re all sick of evil superman, but Hancock\u2019s trailer showed us something we\u2019d never seen before.\n\nThere\u2019s something so relatable about the film\u2019s original concept. Because Hancock isn\u2019t a bad man, he\u2019s a broken man, one who has to find the motivation to become a hero.\n\nAnd then they mess it up by adding a boring, confusing reveal in the final act.",

They gave us a decent horror movie setup and then decided to say \u2018fuck it, it\u2019s a standard love story. The girl loves the slasher because\u2026well apparently she had literally nothing going on in her life\u2019.\n\nAs I said, even when the movie addressed it it downplayed it. Treated it as a somewhat serious breach of trust rather than premeditated kidnapping and permanent imprisonment. Yes we can judge him harshly when his response is subjecting someone else to his hell just because. A sane person would have just killed themselves if they couldn\u2019t stand it. It takes a monster to decide \u2018Whelp, time to damn this random woman because I\u2019m really lonely and would like to bang her\u2019. The movie doesn\u2019t treat his actions as irredeemable, indeed he\u2019s redeemed remarkably easily and she falls right back in love with him.\n\nEvery review I\u2019ve seen, none on Reddit because I don\u2019t read Reddit reviews, had the movie switching from a romance to a horror to a romance as a major problem. The movie didn\u2019t know what it wanted to be and ended up being horrible because of it. Romance all the way? Sure. Romance to surprise horror? Also sure. Romance to surprise horror then back to romance? Now there\u2019s an issue. The movie presents a frankly horrifying scenario as uplifting and positive.\n\nYou can\u2019t cast your way out of that. People didn\u2019t like Pratt in the role because the role didn\u2019t know what it wanted to be. It wanted him to be both Americas Golden Boy AND a selfish bastard who kidnaps a random woman to make her love him. These 2 things cannot coexist in anyone.",

I love the idea of Dracula's manservant going to support groups to try and overcome his codependency lol, but I was let down by the tired ironic action sequences that drove the plot, and I thought the meme'd out dialogue was way off for an idea with so much inherent style.\n\nNicholas Cage was insanely great, main dude was very good, I liked the exaggerated world it was set in, and I liked a lot of the visual gags. But the movie felt like it was torn between something really original and something cynical and uninspired. If they were less concerned with the bottom line I think they would have had something pretty good.",

There are bits and pieces here and there that seem like the stuff of pulpy works (the twins, the suspected politician, the eager understudy, the serial killer with such elaborate ways of showing of their work, etc.) and that sort of stuff may be easier to swallow in a novel than seeing it in full color and on a screen.\n\nEither way, a curiosity of a failure for sure!",

The character was supposed to be a burned out alcoholic and Fassbender just didn\u2019t have that look about him.  He was too healthy looking!\n\nBut yeah, how do you start up a film and then somehow not film big sections of the screenplay and only *then* realize you have a near incoherent film on your hands?\n\nThe sad thing is, though, that even with my mind patching up those missing scenes, I *still* came away rather unimpressed with the overall story being told.  Again, maybe as written on the page and in the novel these things worked better but in a film form it just felt so melodramatic and overly pulpy\u2026 and not in a very good way!",

They didn\u2019t know the repercussions of their actions.  Had they kept the Japanese from attacking Pearl Harbor and the U.S. therefore didn\u2019t enter the war at that time, it was certainly possible that the unintended consequences would have been that Nazi Germany would have been far more successful in their conquest of Europe.  As sophisticated as the aircraft carrier was, it was still only one carrier with limited supplies and they would have had to somehow ramp up production of much more sophisticated supplies and materials than the U.S. was likely to have at that time to fight the Nazis\u2026 and by then the Nazis might have been even better entrenched in Europe and the inevitable fight against them far more bloody.\n\nSo for me, while it certainly would have been cool to see the then \u201cmodern\u201d aircraft carrier take on the entire Japanese fleet, I felt the movie was true to its philosophical questions.",

It's very similar to the concept of Avatar, also from 2009, but instead of big blue aliens, people's avatars are humans.\n\nIt invites philosophic discussion about how people's surrogates are often an imperfect ideal of humanity. Once we see a beautiful woman surrogate, but the real human is a fat dude (it's 2009 so it's played as a joke and an insult calling the fat dude a pervert as opposed to a trans statement). There's an argument for whether or not it's moral or fulfilling to live life through these surrogates as opposed to raw-dogging reality. It could have been a metaphor for drug use, or the overconsumption of media, but I don't think it delved into that. There might have been some socioeconomic discussions because presumably this would be expensive, but I don't remember.\n\nI don't remember shit beyond the premise because once Bruce Willis unplugs it becomes a boring generic action film. I don't remember what the plot was, how it was resolved, or what points the film actually trying to make beyond a vague \"this is bad\". It should have been a slow, philosophical film that deeply explores the premise, like Blade Runner does. But it decides to be an action film instead, which is ironically more boring.",

There's no correlation between events other than omg something awful happened. don't even get me started on the meaning of double \"E\".\n\ngranted, i still enjoyed the movie. so it's the opposite for me. a terrible premise like so many other nic cage movies that he makes enjoyable through his ridiculous acting.",

There was so much 'open space' to explore by simply watching the 1931 original Dracula. From the moment Renfield arrives at Castle Dracula until his demise at Carfax Abbey....so much could have been done but a wonderful opportunity was wasted.",

PARTS of resident evil games are great, BUT, I don' think the movies are that far off from the BAD convoluted JRPG style bullshit that some of the latter Resident Evils are prone to.   \n\n\nShould the movie just have been a version of the first film, probably. But at that time we hadn't seen a lot of great video game adaptations that tried to do exactly the source material.",

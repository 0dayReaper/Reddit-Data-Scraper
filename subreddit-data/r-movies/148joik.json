    "postText": "Hello all! I have come to realize my favourite \"genre\" of film is Clue. That is, films where people get stranded in a house, someone gets killed off mysteriously and everybody's a suspect thereafter. So I come to you for advice on Clue films! Please, comment every single one you can remember, whether good or bad, whether old or new: bodies bodies bodies? Clue for gen-z. 7 donne e un mistero? Clue by italian ladies. Glass onion? Moneygrabby Clue by netflix. They all count. As I am counting on you, r/movies!",

You could also try And Then There Were None it's the film version of Agatha Christine's Ten Little Indians. Watch the Oliver Reid and Richard Attenborough version from the seventies and not the one from the forties. Haunted House or Dinner Guest Murder are my favourite kinds of film genre . I love Clue and Murder by Death , they are both fine examples. Another one that springs to mind which combines both the genres I mentioned in my reply is Haunted Honeymoon with Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner it's a comedy too which is a bonus. Have fun watching.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention  Radioland Murders is in a similar vein as Clue et al but is set in a radio station during the forties also another comedy.",

Anything based on Agitha Christie is a good bet, but avoid Kenneth Branagh's newest adaptations until you've seen the 60s and 70s stuff. If you like the comedy in Clue, you'll probably enjoy Murder by Death, and I highly recommend The Last of Sheila for parlor mystery fans.",

And yes, some do redeem themselves, but it doesn't always make up for the damage they caused. They hurt and even kill people, they cause a lot of damage to property and public safety, they steal, cheat, persecute ,etc . So they were still villains, even if they ultimately change their ways.",

People that don\u2019t see him as a villain probably have a Punisher skull on their jacked up truck.",

William's crimes would be Terrorism, Manslaughter, Public Endangerment, Murder, Theft, Assault, Torture, Trespassing, Child Endangerment, Domestic Abuse (including Child Abuse), Stalking, Harassment, Attempted Familicide and Vandalism. William is a Wrathful Anarchist.",

She\u2019s still pure evil. \n\nDo you think accidentally killing someone\u2019s son when the intended target was the father is actually any better? Murder was still the intent, and would have left two children without a father and his wife a widow if he murdered the person he intended to. There is nothing less evil about accidentally killing the wrong person. \n\nCaring for your dogs (which are more like servants in Up) doesn\u2019t redeem you from trying to commit a murder on someone.\n\nETA: was supposed to be a reply to a comment below",

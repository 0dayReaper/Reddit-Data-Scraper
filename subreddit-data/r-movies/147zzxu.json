Like she's a fully grown adult human when they were filming, and I'm sure they were all laughing on set during the scene. \n\nAnd the point of the scene is to make you super freaking uncomfortable.

He was only caught because a gym buddy reported him to the authorities. The hit man who he attempted to hire was an undercover agent. It\u2019s a wild tale and it\u2019s a damn shame because I, along with a large swath of metal heads, enjoyed their music so much. Hearing it now instantly reminds me of that man\u2019s depravity and I can\u2019t not think about it when a song of theirs comes on and what those lyrics relate to.

People champion the movie as tapping into the real life anxiety of that as a way to amplify the tension, which it succeeds in. \n\nBut the whole time Roman Polanski was abusing Sharon Tate. From being controlling, imposiong threesomes on Sharon, not sleeping with her after she got pregnent, insisting she get an abortion, and then flying to london and having an affair while his pregnant wife stays behind. \n\nIs it real hard to believe that the guy who gave a child drugs and then sodomize her under the pretenses of a fashion shot would be above any of this?\n\nNo, fuck Roman Polanski and fuck this movie",

Film isn\u2019t the byproduct of one person so it really sucks when one person taints the whole production.

It\u2019s not glorifying underage rape and Polanski sure as hell isn\u2019t making light of anything remotely close to that, so in my book I feel fine watching the film. If it were found, for example, that Tarantino was making the women uncomfortable in his films and sexually harassed them for his foot fetish, I would probably not feel good about watching his films (especially Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) because it\u2019s so clear and obvious why he includes those shots.",

But that's ok. Because it's *the art I like*, so I can justify it. It doesn't matter if *it was still brutal torture against a woman*, torturing her for money and profit, but it wasn't *that crime*.\"\n\nAnd yes. It was torture. She lost hair.

There was also something else that struck me about the era in which the movie was made (late 1960s), and how grown women were routinely treated like children.  This was at a time of pre-women\u2019s rights and ability for women to have agency. For example, and in particular: when she went to her own doctor alone for some help, but he discounts her worries and calls her husband.  It was probably typical back then.  But it added to her fears since she was suspicious of her husband.  Great movie!",

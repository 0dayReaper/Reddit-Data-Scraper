Shit its where I heard about sad deaths like Judith Barsi and Brittany Murphy. \n\nIts a shame they got rid of them. Since they did I almost never go on IMDB anymore. \n\nFunny enough I never participated, I just lurked lol",

He also confirmed something that has been rumored for years - that Michael Ritchie really directed the movie (it\u2019s officially credited to Mickey Rose, a screenwriter with no other directing credits). Ritchie might have declined credit out of deference to the strike. Great information.",

It was always a shock finding so many people who had watched all of Kurosawa, Bergman and Fellini's filmography who hadn't even finished high school.\n\nMy theory is that cinephilia of that era and earlier required more effort - you had to buy/rent DVDs or pirate movies. Now you rely mostly on streaming services with their inbuilt algorithms most of which are primarily populated by movies in the last two decades.",

Some are archived and some aren't (it's designed that way, not a bug), don't ask me why.  \n\nBut the archiving isn't the problem, it's that once a thread is old, nobody sees it (without direct searching for it) or contributes to it anymore, whereas with IMDB, a thread would be bumped to the top of the list when there was activity, so you could comment on an old thread and it could become active again because everyone coming to the movie's page, even ten years later, would potentially see and join the thread to continue adding to it over the years (for certain popular threads).  \n\nEveryone would see the threads based on activity/popularity, not age; they didn't have to go hunt them down.  Reddit does at least have subreddits devoted to popular TV shows, if you know to search for them, so you can gather threads about a show together in one place (still not as good with no way to bump a thread to the front page), but generally not for movies.",

Reddit has broad film discussion, but with IMDB forum you could pull up even the most obscure films and find a variety of topics on them, both recent and years old. All together in lists at the bottom of movie main pages. They were quite popular too, I was shocked when IMDB / Amazon closed them.. I think it was due to a lack of control (lot of critical posts and controversial films would get thread bombed) as well as not wanting to spend the resources to staff moderators. Ultimately IMDB as a movie database is a tool that can be somewhat manipulated and used to promote Amazon's own projects- the boards were borderline impossible for corporate to consistently maintain and handle messaging, so they axed them",

There was a near-guarantee that a seemingly innocuous conversation about a movie would descend into an ad hominem battle.  If you see 40 comments on a topic about some indie romance, 20 will be two people shit talking each other.  And of course, anyone who didn't appreciate, or was even curious, about a beloved film would be told to \"Go watch *Transformers*.\"  (Yes, *Transformers* was the go-to punching bag well before *Twilight*.)\n\nSomeone would say, \"Can someone explain what I'm not getting about *Full Metal Jacket*?\"  \"Stick to *Transformers*.\"  Almost every time.\n\nThat's not to say Reddit is all civil, but in my experience it is oddly a lot more civil.  Disagreements can be good-natured.\n\nSo loved them at the time; but I have much better discussions on Reddit.",

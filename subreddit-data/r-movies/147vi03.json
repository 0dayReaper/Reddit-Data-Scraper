I've seen people say GoT dragons arent dragons but wyverns because of the two legs. And sure in some stories a wyvern has two legs and a drwgon has 4. But in myths there are dragons with no legs, 4 legs, 2 legs, some that are wise and helpful, some that don't speak, only hoard gold and murder, and even some that do speak but are also evil and love riddles.",

There isn't one single origin to modern western dragons, just like there isn't one universal classification for types of dragons.\n\nThe drakon you mention is the name of a type of greek monster, but there are also germanic, semitic, etc origins to dragons. And in fact, even if we stay in the greek sphere: the \"drakon\" also appears in apocryph texts about Jesus in Egypt as a kid, where he supposedly fought a beast. We only have a greek version of that text, and it mentions a \"drakon\", that lived in burrows on the banks of a river (probably the Nile), and \"its breath was like fire\". It is unknown what exactly is meant by that, but it is thought to be one of the main origins of the christian dragons. And it's also pretty clear that the creature described there was a Nile crocodile.\n\nTHe Greeks themselves didn't think a drakon had to be a three headed snake. Around the 5th century BCE it was any kind of giant snake. Later on it would be any kind of reptilian monster.\n\nAfawk there's no \"original dragon\", because it's just a modern category that encompass many different lines of mythology from different cultures and different times.",

You always dreamed of your toys coming to life as a kid, they had humanities voyage to the stars and a little robot that could, an old man who's wife died and he wanted to fulfill their dying wish. There were variations, but you get the gist. There was something to ground them and make the characters human and relatable. Now their playing with the same abstract ideas but moving more and more toward abstract characters and there's a disconnect. They've alienated their audience. Imagine any of their past stories and then replace the characters with amorphous blobs of matter/energy, and now remove them from the real world like with soul or elemental. It doesn't work. They're still hugely creative and beautifully designed... but their not relatable in the same way, And it loses its charm.",

But to balance it out there are the scenes with the hippie who can reach the ethereal realm by spinning a sign. There's the hater at the barbershop who probably went insane after seeing Terry. The moments grounded in reality are shown when we're in reality. It's very on the nose in this sense. And I think thats the whole point of the movie. Stay grounded, dont worry about what couldve happened, even if there is an ethereal after death world we still have our loved ones and lives here. However it's not likely many kids are considering their lives wasted, up until a near death experience. So maybe in that sense it's a bit different.",

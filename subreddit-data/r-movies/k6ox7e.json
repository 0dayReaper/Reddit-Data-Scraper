The Warren Ellis and Jeff Lemire runs from the 2010\u2019s are also highly loved by fans. The Ellis run was only like 6 issues long IIRC so not too much of a time investment. I think all of this should be on Marvel Unlimited if you have that.\n\nAlso, one issue of Moon Knight I don\u2019t see get mentioned much was Secret Avengers #19 also by Warren Ellis. There was a very brief run of Secret Avengers that Ellis did that was a ton of fucking fun, and MK got his own spotlight issue that was really really great. It\u2019s not a MK-focused series (Ellis did a bunch of self-contained one-offs) and not required reading, but I\u2019d really recommend it if you can find it. Moon Knight is in a few issues of it but #19 is the one that I remember he got to do a bunch. There was another fun issue he did that had Shang-Chi (who\u2019s also getting a movie soon). I believe that one was #18. There\u2019s probably a collected edition that has all of Ellis\u2019 Secret Avengers run, which I would recommend to anyone.\n\nPersonally I would hold off on the Huston run before you read the ones I mentioned in the first paragraph. It\u2019s pretty good actually but I feel like starting with it first sets up some misguided expectations of what the character should be - there seemed to be a lot of people out there who had this notion that you can\u2019t do a good Moon Knight tv show unless it\u2019s rated R and really violent and bloody, which is total nonsense. And I think the Huston run is fairly responsible for that - very violent comic. There\u2019s a pretty gruesome scene - gonna try not to spoil too much - that would become iconic (for the character) in which Moon Knight commits an act of body horror on another character. So yeah, when people talk of rated R Moon Knight, they\u2019re usually thinking of this run. But that\u2019s generally not what the character is. \n\nI tend to have an aversion towards anything Bendis is involved with, and his MK run is no exception there. His run on MK was the one that was previously my least favorite out of all of them. The art is pretty damn good but but I didn\u2019t like the way he handled certain aspects of the character. I don\u2019t think \u201cflanderized\u201d is the right term here, but it definitely played up certain parts of the character in ways I wasn\u2019t fond of. In hindsight the Bendis run isn\u2019t the worst thing that\u2019s happened and I\u2019ve grown less down on it over time.\n\nStay the fuck away from the Bemis run. Don\u2019t read it, don\u2019t touch it, don\u2019t acknowledge it.\n\nThere\u2019s some other stuff MK\u2019s been in but those are some of the big ones. For example there were a couple of writers who worked on the character in between Ellis and Lemire, and although I did think those issues were solid fun, they didn\u2019t receive as much acclaim as the Ellis/Lemire runs. I would still recommend them if you enjoy the other stuff you read - they\u2019re nowhere as destructive for the character as other writers were. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s too much information, I\u2019ve just been a lifelong Moon Knight fan so I get very enthusiastic about the character. To be honest for the longest time the prospect of him getting added to the MCU seemed like such a pipe-dream, so the fact that it\u2019s happening seems unreal still. If you\u2019re looking for the TL;DR, just read the first paragraph.",

Most adaptations are. \n\nThe core of Metal Gear isn't this specific goofy storyline... it's the goofiness. It's taking video-game parodies of action-movie villains seriously enough to question how reality works. MGS3 has a guy who controls bees and he barely makes the top five weirdest moments in the game. MGS2 has more layers of reality and hyperreality than [House](http:///) of Leaves. All of these games exist as complicated jokes by westaboo ultranerd Hideo Kojima, and every last one of them was intended to be The Last One. The whole story does not matter. Every piece was made-up to serve a purpose. \n\nMagical realism is all that matters. Hollywood does that all the time. All MGS does is gather up the silly concessions like psychic powers and lightning bullets and *cram* them into one story, wherein the protagonist does not give a single fuck about whether they make sense. Glowing mushrooms recharge batteries? Sure, he needed that. This guy's bullets ricochet like billiards balls? Well, better watch your cover. Fifty Metal Gears in a row? Aim for the knees. \n\nMetal Gear Solid's story is a spec-ops soldier sent by people he shouldn't trust on a mission he's not informed about with tools he can't possibly have and enemies he doesn't understand. \n\nIt's a movie where the colonel can tell Snake what the passcode to a door is because we the audience saw the bad guy type it in. It's a movie where the colonel can tell Snake that's why he knows it now, and Snake the character is not permitted to comprehend that fourth-wall break. We have to hope the studio understands that tone.",

They canceled Silent Hill PT even though it was being worked on and was getting raving press after the demo. Konami cut all ties with Kojima and made \"Metal Gear Survive\". Don't get me wrong. I hope this comes out, I hope Kojima is involved, and I hope David Hayter gets a cameo.",

They get to pay homage to Snake Plissken and Kurt Russell is an amazing choice for anything.\n\nEdit: to everyone asking if Snake was inspired by Snake from Escape from New York, yes he was. Kojima and Carpenter have said as much. That\u2019s why they would get to pay an homage.\n\nEdit 2: Everybody telling me that Oscar Isaac should play both because they\u2019re clones I HAVE PLAYED MGS BEFORE... I KNOW. Also Liquid was a clone of Big Boss and looked nothing like him. This is also a franchise with cyborg ninjas, a hand that possesses a person, and fucking Psycho Mantis let\u2019s stop trying to inject logic into Metal Gear Solid. I\u2019m just saying it would be a fun casting that would make my day, damn.\n\nEdit 3: I know that he faked his possession by the arm, y\u2019all are missing the fucking point. MGS is a weird series, we don\u2019t need to apply logic for a casting. Also, I\u2019m not the casting agent.\n\nEdit 4: FINE SOLID AND LIQUID EXACTLY ALIKE EXCEPT FOR THE HAIR, WHATEVER. Let\u2019s not forget that Daniel Logan was supposed to be Temeura Morrison\u2019s clone in Star Wars, it\u2019s a fucking movie.",

Because I spent so much time reading about video games and the video game industry, I knew a lot about it. The article I read was full of errors that shocked me. I immediately thought that this means there might be just as many errors in all the other articles of the magazine. That moment really sparked my critical thinking towards the media.",

    "postText": "Recently watched the first 3 Indiana Jones movies and I am absolutely baffled by the fact that Raiders of the Lost Ark has an 8.4 rating on IMDb, and is regularly cited as one of the top films to watch in your lifetime etc. I found it to be absolutely dire... The cinematography is bizarre and jarring shots and transitions (feels like it was shot by a 17year old cinema student not Steven Spielberg), there's not fluidity, danger just suddenly happens with no build up of suspense and then the action stuff seems to go on and on with not let up before ending abruptly, the plot is almost non existent and there are weird plot holes, things go unexplained and the characters motivations and choices just don't feel compelling, the fight scenes are very cringe... I don't know it felt like one of the worst movies I'd seen in a while on a lot of levels.\nApparently there's no debate that Temple of Doom is terrible (whole heartedly agree) and I found the Last Crusade to actually be not too bad. But I do not get why Raiders of the Lost Ark is supposed to be good.\nWhat am I missing here? Can someone enlighten me?\n(I would like to point out for reference that I'm a big fan of Star Wars, and I kinda like that old 70s/80s corny over the top cinema with janky special effects, which is why I'm all the more baffled by how much I disliked Indiana Jones).\nThanks!\n\nEdit: hey all - ok I can't really reply to all the comments so I thought I'd clear up a few things... I didn't really expect this kind of response, I didn't mean to offend anybody, and I'm sorry if this was perceived as ragebait or trolling, it genuinely is not.\n\nSo I just wanted to give some context.\nSome have suggested I'm a teenager who has only seen recent action films: this is not the case, I'm a millennial and films such as Marvel or John Wick aren't my go-to genre (haven't seen John Wick and have seen a fair bit of the MCU). As a millennial, it'll come as no surprise to any of you that my favourite films of all time are the LOTR trilogy...\n\nI like films, I'd say I'm a higher than average cinema-goer, I've seen quite a few films but also I'm by no means a film-buff, there are quite a lot of classics I haven't seen (which is the reason why I recently watched Indiana Jones, cause it's a must-see!). I've been slowly working my way through the list of films on IMDb with an 8.0+ rating and this is the first time I've felt I didn't agree with the rating.\n\nMy partner says I'm an easy-going film goer, meaning that I tend to like most things and that's why I enjoy going to the cinema: I can pretty easily get stuck into a film and just enjoy it.\n\nI actually generally tend to like older movies. Like I said I love the original Star Wars, and grew up watching 60s musicals with my Nana (think West Side Story, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Singing in the Rain, the Sound of Music...). \n\nBased on all of the above, I was FULLY expecting to love Indiana Jones. \n\nHence this post: I was so surprised that I found it really bad that I started looking for answers.\n\nI have been researching on the internet (watching videos and reading articles etc) and I appreciate those who pointed me towards further research. This post was just part of my research, I wanted to hear what people on this sub thought.\n\nAgain: I am asking to be proven wrong. I want to know why it is considered good.\nJust because I can't see why it's good doesn't mean there aren't reasons why it is. I want to be enlightened.\n\nAnd finally to clarify on two further points:\n- I'm happy to be proven wrong on the cinematography, storytelling, etc. However there is obvious racism and sexism permeating particularly Temple of Doom, and yes I get that the films are \"of their time\", in the same way as the James Bond films, but that doesn't make it ok today.\n- Regarding Temple of Doom, last night I was reading some interview extracts where Steven Spielberg himself said he didn't like it and critic reviews from the time saying it wasn't great. One of those reviews was (I may be paraphrasing): \"constantly sitting on the edge of your seat gives you a sore bum\" which was basically my experience of Temple of Doom: constant over the top action scenes which just made it pretty tiring to watch.\n\nOk that's it, if people still want to comment and give me further reading or their personal experience of liking the film(s) that would be great. Thanks !",

The movie isn't high drama with complex characters, plots or acting , it's a fun romp.  \nOnline commentary and fan base analysis has increased the  knowledge of the audience and forced the writing to have a deeper background for characters which wasn't really done for most movies from the 70's/80's for blockbuster movies.",

            "comment": "I don't know where to begin.\n\nOkay.\n\nAll I can suggest is that you try to take yourself back to when this film came out and remember that Raiders followed a period of cinema mostly filled with anti-heroes and counter-culture.\n\nThe 1970s saw the release of many groundbreaking films that tackled relevant social and political issues. Reflecting the tumultuous times, filmmakers delved into topics such as Vietnam War, Watergate scandal, civil rights, feminism, and counterculture movements. Movies like \"The Godfather\" (1972), \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979), \"All the President's Men\" (1976), and \"Annie Hall\" (1977) captured the zeitgeist of the era and offered complex and thought-provoking narratives. It was also a period of cinematic experimentation,  in terms of cinematography and editing.\n\nBasically, two filmmakers said \"fuck that.\" Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Both were instrumental in fighting the anti-hero trend of the 1970s by attempting to recapture the joy and spirit of the heroic adventures from the 1940s. Both directors were deeply influenced by the classic adventure films and serials of their youth, and they sought to bring that sense of excitement and escapism back to the big screen. Indeed, through their collaboration and individual works, Spielberg and Lucas made significant contributions to the revitalization of the adventure genre, which has continued until today.\n\nThrough their films, Spielberg and Lucas successfully tapped into a nostalgic yearning for heroic storytelling and brought it into the modern era. They rekindled the joy of watching brave and virtuous characters triumph over adversity, challenging the prevailing anti-hero trend of the 1970s. Their works reminded audiences of the power of imagination, the allure of escapism, and the enduring appeal of classic heroism.\n\nThe Indiana Jones films weren't so much great films as important films, and they were joyful films more than cinematic achievements. And as someone who saw Raiders of the Lost Ark when it first came out, I can only tell you that, after a decade of depressing and cynical anti-heroes, Indiana Jones was a revelation.",

It just didn't feel to me like a well made fun romp, more like a haphazardly thrown together romp where the 'romping' and constant over the top action took over everything else. I guess that's where my disappointment stemmed from.",

                            "comment": "Interesting since, in fact, Spielberg's films are anything but haphazardly thrown together. Just the opposite. Every scene is actually carefully planned. It's what he's known for. I can't post the photo but there's a great shot of Spielberg looking at one of the models for a scene in Raiders here:  polygon dot com/23631001/best-steven-spielberg-movies\n\nNot really sure how to respond about the over-the-top action. It was the point of those films, and those incredible action scenes continue to influence modern filmmakers. And it's worth remembering that all of those scenes were real - not a frame of CGI - with real sets (or models or matte paintings) and extras, all of whom were being meticulously choreographed by assistant directors. Check out this youtube vid: www dot youtube dot com/watch?v=jFRcmZ4d2SU&amp;ab\\_channel=FameFocus\n\nI also suggest checking out a terrific analysis by director Stephen Soderbergh (Erin Brockovich, Oceans Eleven, etc.), who suggests watching the film in black and white to really appreciate the cinematography and staging here: extension765 dot com/blogs/soderblog/raiders\n\n(I really loved West Side Story for this reason. He used all of his experience in planning action shots in adventure films for the dance scenes and it's spectacular! I hope you've seen it.)\n\nBut I'd add, Raiders and Last Crusade (not so much Temple of Doom, which everyone admits), had really well developed characters, who were relatable and engaging. Indiana Jones was not just an action hero; he had depth, flaws, and vulnerabilities, making him more sympathetic to the audience. The supporting characters, such as Marion Ravenwood and Marcus Brody, also had distinct personalities and motivations.\n\nThe interplay between Indiana and Marion, in particular, is compelling because a scandalous backstory is hinted at (he was a grad student who had a relationship with his favourite Prof's teenage daughter - \"It was wrong and you knew it, \" she says) and that tension and bitterness drives every scene with them together. We didn't need this backstory for the adventure but it sure added to how we felt about the characters. That's good writing. (Incidentally, if you want to dislike Indiana Jones because he was a borderline pedophile, that's legit, and many others have raised this objection.)\n\nAnyway, you can tell I love these films. And I didn't even tell you about the time I was chased out of a movie theatre while stealing a Raiders of the Lost Ark lobby card (and I still have it.) Sorry they didn't work for you. But film is art, and that's how it goes with art. It resonates or it doesn't ;)",

I probably enjoyed Raiders when I was like 8 but by the time you're educated about your culture (for me it was about age 13) you understand where the references come from and that those references are not in favor of POC cultures but the status quo of taking our sacred and valued objects and curating them.\n\nsimply the orientalization/othering/ and stereotypes those films engage in are super problematic even not considering the plot. also its implied that Indiana jones had a relationship with his underage student. the entire series is just uncomfortable for any minority to sit through including young women.\n\nstop pretending this isn't the case.\n\nits the only series that persists from the 70s in the same way as it did then. \n\nStar Wars for example firstly had more approachable themes and appeal, spoke in favor of the rebels, diversity, freedom from empire and in addition as Star Wars exests now its visuals and characters are far more diverse than they were in the 70s/the 80s. while Indiana jones is just about the same white dude named Indiana jones and a young white man (Shia) or a young white woman (waller-bridge) that's why they should have got Huy kuan to evolve the brand into something with broader and more modern appeal. they could keep Harrison as a mentor or even buddy them together. but instead of changing things visually or with cast or plot they just put In waller bridge to say these things in lines in the movie instead of actually evolving the film itself.",

I'm not even saying it's always a good thing, just pointing out that's the reasoning I have found as an answer to the initial question. there can be many other reasons sure but to pretend this perspective isn't key is to ignore reality.",

The kid in me kinda wants to see the new one just for the nostalgia but I think there are more people like you and I out there. Maybe just not on this post :) I\u2019m into horror, Tarantino and Scorsese. I also was bored by The Godfather and I get all kinds of hate for that but movies are supposed to be subjective.

And so what your version of objectivity is, is your fact it\u2019s not a fact to somebody else. So therefore, it can\u2019t really be a fact it can be an opinion. Those three movies, while critically acclaimed, are not going to be loved and revered, or even liked by everybody because if they didn\u2019t like it, they didn\u2019t like it and they may be swayed upon a second viewing, maybe, but if they don\u2019t like it, they don\u2019t have a problem and there\u2019s not necessarily something wrong with the script. It\u2019s just how the movie made them feel. Now, those are very depressing movies but that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not amazing. To some people. I couldn\u2019t really get into Apocalypse now, maybe it\u2019s a Francis Ford Coppola thing with me, I loved raging Bull. Schindler\u2019s list was powerful. It\u2019s entertainment.",

Raiders was always my least favorite of the original 3.\n\nI haven't watched them in probably a good decade but I recently picked up the 4k steelbook of raiders since it became available again and I want to upgrade my collection to 4k.\n\nAfter rewatching it again I remember why it's my least favorite Indy movie. It's not very good, at least to me. It does feel rushed with a paper thin story and it's mostly spectacle over substance. It's hard to believe it's a vintage Spielberg movie, it feels like the 80s equivalent of a Michael Bay movie or Roland Emmerich. \n\nMaybe they leaned too hard into the Saturday morning serial aspect of it, I don't know. I get that it's universally loved and I don't think it's a horrible movie, I'm not here to shit on it or people that love it. I just don't think it's as good as the praise it receives.",

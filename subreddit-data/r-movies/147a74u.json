    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am hoping to get some insight into American Graffiti. I watched it last week, and I found it to be beautiful, but often creepy, like a porcelain doll. I recognized that there is probably no more accurate and loving portrait of 50s and 60s cruising life (and the connection to a region I grew up in also made an impression on me), but a few things didn't really sit well with me. You probably could tell before reading this far what they were. The coercive attempt at sex between Steve and Laurie, the catch-22 with Carol that John finds himself in, and Curt appearing to get away with stealing the change from the arcade games although I know he was kind of forced into hanging out with that group. Are these all things that we are just more aware of in the time since the movie was made, or are there legitimate things about those elements that I am missing? I really loved the whole movie except for those parts so I am curious the input of someone who is far more familiar with it than I am.",

A huge amount of cultural/societal shift has happened since that time. Of course people these days view many interactions and beliefs much differently than 50 years ago. Now imagine it's 1973 and you're watching and analysing a film from 1923. You'd also find a significant amount of issues and concerns between the cultural mores of those years too. It's the same  from 1923 to 1873. These changes are generally considered progress.\n\nbtw, I'm not defending any of these issues, just trying to give some perspective.",

She uses his reputation and her age to make a false rape charge threat to make the most of a night where her sister ditched her and he ends the night by falsely claiming he might rape her because he doesnt want to see her get hurt. \n\nThey clearly patch things up with that kiss on the cheek goodnight but he clearly wishes it didnt have to go down that path but at the same time is happy that what might be his last day alive was a pretty decent one. And Carol realizes that what she did was wrong but is happy that John was willing to actually show her a good night and give her a certain degree of affection, even if romantically it was very one sided from Carol's end. \n\nIts a weird relationship and its meant to be a bit uncomfortable but its also probably my favorite dynamic in the film.",

It's their relationship that makes them start to meet in the middle. It's a neat little yin yang thing.",

That type of interaction doesn\u2019t really hold up to the cultural mores of the 2020s but it definitely holds up to the cultural mores of that time.  That\u2019s just how it goes over time, you can\u2019t judge films out of their time really or if you do it has to be on timeless objective merit more-so than what people did at that time vs now.

There are things depicted in American Graffiti that wouldn't have been considered okay even in the 1970s when it was made; that was often intentional on George Lucas' part, he was emphasizing the cultural differences between the 50s/early 60s and the 70s as well.",

Lucas did go on to create Luke and Leia whose relationship early on is pretty awkward when you discover who their parents are. But seriously I think some of the things you are focusing on were not something Lucas spent much time developing. Great movie its just been 50 years and the way we view some things on screen is very different than it was then.",

Otherwise, his friends attest that his attempts at \"chasing girls\" both as a youth in Modesto and as a student in USC were less than succesfull until he met Marcia. And yeah, you can see that in his movies which are pretty chaste. Even the sex scenes in *THX-1138* I found tame. Early drafts of Star Wars were a touch sexier than the finished film, but not by much.\n\nI don't think its fair to cite the \"nature\" of Luke and Leia's relationship, because they weren't siblings until 1981. There's literarlly an early sketch for Return of the Jedi where Lucas goes through the entire plot and then next to Leia's name in the victory celebrations he suddenly jotts down \"SISTER!\"",

            "comment": "From web searches:\n\nLucas made the movie in 1972, and it was highly autobiographical. In an interview in The New York Times, Lucas said of the film: It all happened to me, but I sort of glamorized it. I spent four years of my life cruising the main street of my hometown, Modesto, California.\nIn Lucas's own words, the message of the film is that \"you can't live in the past\u2026 everything is changing and you have to accept change\". Nevertheless, the film gives one the chance to experience the past before radical changes would lead to the widespread segmentation of American society.\n\nAnother fun fact, and a great trivia question: I guess this was the only town in America where teenagers never heard a song by Elvis Presley! RCA didn't agree to allow any of his songs in AG. That's sad.\n\nUnless I'm wrong, and I hope I am, we do not see any black teens depicted in the film\nHaving said that, it was easy to be in areas of a city that was basically all white, so again, this is what Lucas saw and lived.",

The coercive attempt at sex between Steve and Laurie, the catch-22 with Carol that John finds himself in, and Curt appearing to get away with stealing the change from the arcade games although I know he was kind of forced into hanging out with that group. Are these all things that we are just more aware of in the time since the movie was made, or are there legitimate things about those elements that I am missing?\n\nSo the guy who browses BikiniMilfs and LingerieCumshot is upset that a movie about teenagers in the early 60's has them acting like teenagers in the early 60's? Would you rather have a movie where nobody does anything?",

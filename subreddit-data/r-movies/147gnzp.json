    "postText": "I watched this movie recently and while I found the cinematography to be great and had some intense dramatic sequences, I was left very confused about what I just saw. I went in not knowing a lot and after looking at different peoples analyzations online I\u2019m even more confused. I\u2019ve been many films where they make the viewer dig for meaning or tell a story in a peculiar way but I\u2019m pretty lost on this one. Can someone who has seen it help explain?",

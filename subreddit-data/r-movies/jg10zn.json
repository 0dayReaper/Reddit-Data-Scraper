He was at the studio for something else, they asked if he would help out with their test footage.  They kept calling him every time they redid the footage and once it was finally greenlit by the studio they just gave him the part.  No audition or anything.  Pretty awesome.  \n  \nBTW, if you haven't seen Middleditch and Schwartz on Netflix you need too, its so fucking awesome.",

Wouldn't be my choice, but it deserves the benefit of the doubt at least.\n\nBut Mark Wahlberg as Sully *completely* lost me. It's one of the biggest miscasts I can think of. What's next, Meryl Streep as Elena?\n\nEDIT: Also, I just found out this is a thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5CZQpqF_74&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\nNearly 9 million views, but sure. Let's go with Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg. How can studio executives be so out of touch?",

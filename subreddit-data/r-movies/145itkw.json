Special effects had the appropriate burners going to simulate charred wreckage and flames. Basically an elaborate propane grill. The idea being you could simply turn on/off a \"burning\" car. Camera dollied by, getting the shot across the flames, cinematographer operating the camera himself. A-List cast across the other side. Director: \"Aaaaand... cut.\" BOOM! All of a sudden a huge burst of flames from the car. The dolly was almost engulfed. DP dove from the rig. Craziest shit I've ever seen up close. Thankfully no one was hurt.\n\n\n\nThe cause? Someone left a can of paint in the car set to burn.",

People who are smart, careful, detail-oriented people are still capable of making dumb mistakes. I don't know how smart and careful and detail-oriented you think you are, but I guarantee you're as guilty of that as I am, or most others. \n\nI really don't think \"some people just should not blah blah\" is fair, like you're painting, excuse the pun, the person who made this mistake as some clueless idiot.\n\nSorry to unload on you in particular here, but I just do not understand why people do this. Maybe it's just social media users that are especially bad about it, but the frequency of someone posting or talking about one bad decision resulting in a torrent of people like you saying that person is too stupid to live their lives is just insane.\n\nWe're all human. We're all capable of moments of stupidity, thoughtlessness, forgetfulness. We all make bad decisions. You're not smarter than most people you read about or meet.\n\nWhat you are is lucky. You're lucky that your own stupidity didn't result in anything so terrible. And you should recognize it for what it is.\n\nYou're not smarter, you're not better, you're just luckier. And I am too.",

This is unfortunatly bleeding into the real world much more. \n\nWholeheartedly agree, humans are humans.  We fuck up sometimes.  Only way I can see to mitigate this is have multiple checks by multiple people. But that adds cost and time to film.  Still there will be fuckups (but less). Maybe have actors go through some kind of safety training as a backstop check.",

Normally it would have been fine since the area near the crash had all been cleared, except the tire decided to veer off and take the small path that lead it on to an active freeway. The tire bounced across the entire freeway, thankfully not hitting anyone, but a CHP saw the tire, quickly showed up on set and yelled at people. Thankfully no one was hurt, but no one could have imagined that would happen.",

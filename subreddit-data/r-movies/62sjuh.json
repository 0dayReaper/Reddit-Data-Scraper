Darth Senate was a Dark Senate of the Senate, so powerful and so wise he could use the Senate to influence the senate to create senate... He had such a knowledge of the dark senate that he could even keep the senate he cared about from dying. The dark senate of the senate is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his senate, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his senate everything he knew, then his senate killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.",

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life\u2026 He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.",

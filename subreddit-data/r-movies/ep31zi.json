            "comment": "&gt; Tarantino refused to edit the Bruce Lee scene out in order to secure a theatrical release in China.\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt;\u201dThey absolutely backed me, 100%,\u201d Tarantino recently told Deadline about Sony agreeing to skip China. \u201cThey were all disappointed, and so was I. Partly because we had Chinese co-producers and we wanted to do well by them. But there is a certain line you cannot cross. If it was just \u2018Ok, Cliff slams Katie\u2019s face into the fireplace four times\u2026can we make it two times?\u2019 Ok, I could do that. To actually remove an entire scene because the country finds that scene objectionable? No.\u201d\n\nCredit to Tarantino I suppose for not willing to ~~comprise~~ compromise his creative vision. Frankly, if his word is anything to go by, I\u2019m surprised Sony wasn\u2019t more insistent.\n\nBut maybe I\u2019m just scarred from them forcefully meddling in one-too-many Spider-Man films.",

He\u2019s one of the few directors in Hollywood that gets his way, and if he doesn\u2019t then there are other studios begging him to do a movie with them instead. His movies both make decent money *and* are prestige projects for the studio at awards season. They won\u2019t throw that away.",

They knew the answer already and their hands were legally tied so it would have been egg on their face as QT would have totally blabbed it around town and in the trades if they even asked. The PR game is Sony now providing quotes effusively supporting QT and QT saying he appreciates, but cards were all already laid.\n\nAn important footnote is that Quentin himself was sacrificing considerable income as he has 25% first dollar gross in his deal. That gives you an idea of how powerful his negotiating position with Sony was to start with. \n\n\nEdit: added last paragraph re first dollar gross; spelling.",

I think the point is more that he was able to hold his own and score some hits on Lee, which the audience largely knows is impressive. I don't know if it's a critical scene, but it does two things. It establishes that Cliff actually knows how to fight, and it furthers the character development that he's a hothead who is willing to start shit with someone like Lee for basically no reason (though I'm not sure exactly how famous Lee was at the time for his fighting skills - he had been in The Green Hornet but hadn't yet made any of his really famous movies). The ending scene is still surprising, but between this fight, the hints at what he did to his wife, and the smacking around he gives the kid at the Manson ranch that slashed his tire, you have enough setup to believe that yeah, this dude could just straight up brutally kill the Manson kids and laugh it off afterwards.",

So what you've said helps preserve non-Chinese cultures and halt the spread of censorship, but it turns a blind eye to those who China is abusing and doesn't do anything to help them.\n\nSo it's a matter of priorities. When I see people getting mad about China - and when I get mad about China - I consider the core issue to be wanting to change human rights abuses. But if someone else, like yourself, focuses more on stopping the spread of Chinese censorship, then free market solutions are a lot more relevant.\n\nIt's really about what you see as the issue around China, which makes your point totally reasonable in a different way than mine, imo.\n\nEdit: And to be super-duper fair, because I don't want to seem like I'm judging other people for their priorities: You could easily say that wack-a-noob's position is real politic: we can't really affect China, and we need to protect ourselves. My position is more idealistic and a lot more difficult to achieve. I still see the human rights as the core problem to be solved, but setting a goal doesn't mean much if it's impossible.\n\nSo I am very glad this person responded, because I think this nicely sums up two of the dominant perspectives on this issue.",

Asians still struggle to be represented so to have a real person who by all intents and purposes was a genuine super bad ass who pushed racial boundaries and barriers be defeated by some white dude... some people feel it's representative of the sort of racism that Bruce was fighting against and a bit of a slap in the face.

Asian men, at the time, and to a degree still to this day, were seen as effeminate and weak. Asian accents and cultural norms are used as jokes in a \"haha look at the crazy, foreigner\" way. What Bruce Lee being an action star, a role solely reserved for the most macho, manly people in Hollywood did was be the first time an Asian had been portrayed as not just the protagonist, but someone desirable, someone who you would think is cool, or look up to. The fact that you still can't name many Asian male actors speaks to how it still pervades. Even now, typically Asian men are portrayed as a sidekick or villain or comic relief. It is very rare for an Asian man to be the hero. \n\nIn Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Bruce Lee is not a character. He's a prop (again no Asian main characters). So with Tarantino's singular Asian, that Asian, an icon in the community is not portrayed as sympathetic in anyway and is portrayed as physically weaker than Brad Pitt's character. It's almost saying, \"Of course that Chinese crap doesn't work. Bruce Lee was just an actor. In real life this American stuntman would kick his ass.\" Bruce Lee knocks down Brad Pitt's character with a kick. Then Bruce Lee is thrown into a car. If Tarantino had wanted to show that Bruce Lee was an equal and competent fighter, he would've choreographed a solid back and forth and let both take fairly equal hits, but Bruce obviously takes a disproportionately worse hit before the fight is ended.",

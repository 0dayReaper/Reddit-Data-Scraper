Several other professional directors have also encouraged him to mix the sound better but he just won\u2019t. It\u2019s pure arrogance at this point and I\u2019m not sure I want to see any of his films anymore because of it. And even if Tenet\u2019s sound had been mixed better I still didn\u2019t like it.\n\nEdit: Found an article to back up what I said: \n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/2020/11/christopher-nolan-directors-complain-sound-mix-1234598386/",

And riding the volume like I'm a DJ only works if there's long stretches of loud or quiet scenes. If there's quick cuts it takes more of my attention than reading all the dialogue.",

A lot of the ads that we show now are downloaded and inserted, too, and they go through a QC stage that's set to really comply with the CALM act.\n\nHowever, there are some advertisers and networks that have figured out ways to trick our systems - if you ramp the volume up slow enough, the systems will change the baseline and let you go quite a bit louder for a little while.\n\nBest thing to do is write down the channel, ad, and time, and file a CALM act violation with the FCC, because that makes providers nervous about their broadcast licenses.",

Whilst you are right there are substantial differences between domestic and theatrical styles of mixing, you actually can remix a theatrical track for domestic. If you've got a good production they will let you do a separate mix. This usually consists of turning the quieter bits up and the louder bits down (ridiculously crude explanation, it's a good deal more skilled than that). \nOtherwise it is a case of folding down from 5.1 to stereo, which is what happens most of the time. So, the loud stuff just stays too loud for a domestic environment. \n\nRe: Netflix and other (domestic) broadcasters, there is actually now a generally agreed upon spec that basically everyone uses. There might be slight differences but it's basically the same. When you hear TV shows with dialogue too quiet it's most because in the mix theatre someone wanted the music/gunshots/insert loud thing here louder. The levels are calculated by averages, so if the loud stuff gets louder, everything else has to come down. The dialogue usually suffers the most in this instance because people hate having to turn it up to hear the dialogue after turning it down for the loud music. And I fully agree with them! \n\nIt always pains us audio folks that we are last in the chain, but when the job is done badly it's often very quick to be blamed.",

Sure it's nice to have giant explosion noises in the theater but when I'm home my neighbours don't really appreciate it. Especially in a condo or townhouse.",

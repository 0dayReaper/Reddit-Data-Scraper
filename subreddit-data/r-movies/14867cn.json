    "postText": "Examples you have of actors or actresses that got roles in Movies without even trying.... \n\nHere are a few examples off the top of my head:\n\nWill Smith------ broke rapper and had no acting experience , when he was offered the Fresh Prince of Bel Air by Quincy Jones. He didn't even want to do it, but took the part to pay back the IRS the taxes he owed. And as luck would have it, Fresh Prince of Bel Air was a huge success. He eventually moved into movies. \n\n Edward Furlong------ Just random kid that lived in LA , They found him at some boys and girls club in Pasadena. They wanted a kid that actually was from a broken home. He auditioned and got the part of John Conner in only one of the biggest movies of all time.\n\nShannyn Sossamon---- She moved to LA to become a DJ. Then she was DJing at some actresses birthday party and some casting director liked her look and asked her to audition for,  A Knights Tale.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The night before auditions, Gibson got into a bar fight, which left him completely bruised in the face. Unexpectedly, his battered look at the audition drew the director's attention, as Miller thought he might be a good fit as an extra, so he asked him to go back in a few weeks. By the time they met again, Gibson had already recovered, and instead of being hired as an extra, he was offered to lead the film.\n\nDanny Trejo:\n\nDanny Trejo was a youth drug counselor when he was approached by a young man, asking for help in dealing with cocaine problems on the set of the movie Runaway Train. Trejo was then helping on set, when screenwriter (and former convict) Edward Bunker recognized him from when they both did time at San Quentin. He offered Trejo not only a job to train Eric Roberts for a boxing scene, but also a small role as a boxer. That kicked off his acting career.",

    "postText": "This movie gets better each time I watch it.  It seriously needs more shine. It\u2019s not a perfect movie by any means, but fun to watch. The pacing gets off in places but Keanu Reeves is great.  I wish there was more about the scene where Matthew tries to pour something to drink and he misses his cup. The characters all seemed believable to me.",

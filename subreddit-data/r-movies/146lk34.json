    "postText": "The teaser for the spiritual sequel set in Barcelona released a few days ago and it looks promising! It prompted me to ask why the first one was so disliked by audiences? It's been a while since I've seen it but all things considered, it was a pretty solid movie. Interesting creatures (that we never even see), interesting plot, characters, scares, and the acting and effects were great. I really don't understand why some people didn't like the first one.",

Like, if you're normal, seeing these Whatevers makes you instantly kill yourself with whatever is handy, but if you're... what, bipolar? Schizophrenic? Autistic? Then the Whatevers seem to really rock your socks, and you become obsessed with showing them to normal people. I don't know if that's supposed to be some kind of metaphor, or what, but it never stopped annoying me. It was an annoying movie. And the viral marketing was annoying too.",

Scott Stuber and Chris Morgan were set to produce the film. In July 2017, after Stuber became head of the feature film division of Netflix, it was announced that Netflix had acquired the rights to the book and would develop the film\n\nWhile it's true that Netflix's production timeline for Birdbox was behind AQP, it's not really fair to call it a copy. Stuber was into this property years before AQP came into existence.",

Bird Box has a very similar concept, so people inevitably made comparisons. The thing is: Bird box is way more dumb and forgettable than A Quiet Place. Bird Box also made a lot of success, but it didn\u2019t had the same impact as A Quiet Place.",

    "postText": "Now that the Hasbro Cinematic Universe (HCU) has officially begun with the new Transformers film ending \ud83e\udd2f could we see a possible Beyblade live action movie. I\u2019m talking about the Hasbro Beyblade characters of course like Jenga and Ryuga. I\u2019m not exactly sure what the plot would be, but I can definitely see something crazy coming out of a Bey movie. The CGI alone would be insane with all the dragons, lions &amp; unicorns. I\u2019d think it could even market towards the anime fans and astrology nerds. But idk I\u2019m just spitballing here.. lmk what you guys think down below.",

But sometimes it\u2019s gold and hits differently. Being able to see my childhood nostalgia in a badass action flick is sick. For some reason I can\u2019t pinpoint an example haha maybe the ninja turtles.",

The classic Jurassic park is based on a book, Scarface is a remake of a movie that was based on a book from the 20\u2019s.  True Lies, Sound of Music, Wizard of Oz, The Magnificent Seven, etc ALL remakes or adaptions.",

Arrival is an amazing movie in my opinion, let's just say that when it comes to movies and series that made our childhood there is an emotional component that should be taken into consideration.",

A live action movie was announced a while ago but it was still in the \"we have an idea\" stage and I doubt it ever moved past that\n\nBut if it were to get made, I want it to be in the style of the metal series commercials. Something in the style of the [Sparx FX commercial](https://youtu.be/xx7azyvcDhM) that focuses less of the action on the beys and more on practical stuntwork could be pretty good (not anything close to the source material, but good as its own thing)",

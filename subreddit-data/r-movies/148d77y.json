    "postText": "So Shaun of the dead(in short terms) is about two guys who try to go to a bar while dodging zombies, according to Irish whisky lore, zombies are built upon the fact that people \u201cin olden times\u201d drank basically poisoned alcohol and went into acoma so they were buried alive because of reasons, and grave robbers found fingernails scratchings on the inside of the coffin, so Shaun of the dead is about two guys trying to get their family to a bar while avoiding drunk people.",

Well, not the very end, but you know what I mean. \n\nMy daughter will randomly tell me \u201cThere\u2019s a girl in the garden\u201d I have no idea why",

I never thought the Winchester was too deep a metaphor in that movie but I could be wrong. Americans are less inclined to be attached to a local pub due to our pitiful sense of community. The shopping mall in Dawn of the dead makes much more sense for an American perspective, lol. The Winchester seems like a good UK response to that.",

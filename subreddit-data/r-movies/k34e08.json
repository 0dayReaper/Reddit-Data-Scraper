The first was a character called Chewbacca. I said: \u2018What the hell is Chewbacca?\u2019 and he told me it was a hairy gorilla on the side of the good guys. Well, all I could think about was three months in a gorilla suit, so I said, \u2018What\u2019s the other part?\u2019 And he said it was the big villain of the film, so I chose that because people always remember the bad guy.\u201d  \n   \nPeople will never forget you, Prowse.

Vader is incredibly physically intimidating and there are multiple moments in the OT where he projects a ton of emotion without any lines (looking between Luke and Palpatine in ROTJ being the most memorable probably). Prowse was a massive part of bringing the character to life.",

James Earl Jones is better remembered as Vader, followed by Sebastian Shaw for being the face of Anakin Skywalker for nearly 20 years. \n\nProwse's contribution was relegated to bar trivia questions, even though his physical performance brought Vader to life just as much as James Earl Jones' voice work. Yet the first thing most people think of when they hear \"Darth Vader\" is Jones' voice, not the man in the suit.",

And that scene is beautifully written. \n\nAs a bonus it absolutely jives with science as well, not just spiritualism. At one point every atom in your body was part of a star, and eventually, after being part of many other living things, eventually will be part of a star again. In essence, you are the wave, or rather the wave is your atoms come together to make a person. Then you\u2019re the water on the shore, unrecognizable now, but spread out and touching, effecting many other things. Then you return to where you came, to eventually be a new wave on a new shore. And in that way we\u2019re never truly gone. \n\nAs Carl Sagan said, \u201cYou are the universe, expressing itself as a human, for just a little while.\u201d",

If we ignore the Wilhelm Scream, which is kind of a special case, I can't think of many sound effects anywhere near as recognizable, and most of the ones that come to mind are also from Star Wars (e.g. blaster and lightsaber noises).",

He was a notorious leak of information because he loved talking to the press, he refused to learn his lines and would just say gibberish in his scenes which would make the job needlessly difficult for his fellow actors who had to act as if he said the right line but without anything to go off of, he would constantly complain that the fencing instructor Bob Anderson wore the armor for the stunts and fight scenes even though they had to do that because he didn't do them right and he kept breaking the props when he tried, etc. And then of course, at the end of the day, his voice was just really, REALLY not suited for the role. Carrie Fisher said they would call him Darth Farmer because of his accent.\n\nThe problems between him and Lucas definitely became a two way street by the end of the trilogy. Its less surprising he wasn't given the role of Anakin when put in that context.",

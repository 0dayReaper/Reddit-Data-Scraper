    "postText": "The only sense I can personally come to think of in collecting physical media of the Criterion Collection is that, while yes their material is of high quality, there exists films in their collection that are not on their channel. Too, if one day the company should not exist digitally then you\u2019d be safe. That\u2019s it. I\u2019ve started collecting a month ago, but I can\u2019t help thinking it\u2019s all just a game of consumerism. Am I seeing this the right way or is there more reason to collecting? What are the legitimate reasons, if there is any?",

I want to own these films so I can watch them whenever I want. My digital copy of BvS had the aspect ratio retroactively altered by WB so I\u2019m glad I bought the physical release. For a long time I was only able to watch FWWM illegally or in a cinema until it was released on Criterion. I also refuse to use Amazon Prime so wouldn\u2019t watch it online and bought the disc. I\u2019ve watched all of these with friends and family. \n\nI also buy nice hardcover books and comics. It\u2019s only stuff I\u2019m going to be looking at multiple times that gets bought. If I end up not liking it I flip it and buy something else I prefer. \n\nDon\u2019t fall into the trap of being a completionist, just buy what you really love and will watch again and again.",

I just got John Wick 4 and it comes with the discs and a digital copy. Meanwhile, my most-recent Criterion purchase cost twice as much and doesn\u2019t offer the same flexible viewing options. Like I get it\u2019s about the disc but it\u2019s nice to have a digital code too.",

    "postText": "One of my church friends started a church library for books and DVDs. She switched churches so her granddaughter could make friends her age, and she put me in charge of the library since I love movies (To be clear, she asked me through another person.)\n\nI've mostly added movies, not so much books. The library now has movies like: **The Greatest Story Ever Told, Jesus of Nazareth, King of Kings, The Jesus Film, The Bible: In The Beginning, The Prince of Egypt, The Ten Commandments, Samson and Delilah, Bella, Chariots of Fire**, **VeggieTales: King George and the Ducky,** and so forth.\n\nI love adding to the library, but it's slow right now. Only a few books and DVDs have been checked out.\n\nThere's my background, here's my question: One of my favorite Jesus movies is **The Last Temptation of Christ.** This is a very controversial movie about Jesus's struggle with His humanity and being crucified. He's tempted to live a normal life but changes his mind and dies on the cross instead. Martin Scorsese directed it.\n\nThe movie isn't Biblical but it's a beautiful what-if story that shows the bravery of Jesus to suffer His death. It's also Rated R for violence (not **Passion of the Christ** level, but there is a bit of blood) and some nudity. (The library does have **Passion** and **Hacksaw Ridge** in it.)\n\nI can see adding **The Last Temptation of Christ** being controversial, however soon my Pastor will be adding a site on the church site for my IMDB reviews of Biblical and faith based movies, and I can add one a month. If I add it to the library, I can post my review explaining why I admire it.\n\nSo, is this a good idea or not? What are your thoughts? If I add it, it won't be right away, since I would be giving my DVD of it and I would want to replace it first.\n\n**EDIT:** Others have said to add **Silence**, I intend to. \n\nThanks for everyone's feedback. :)",

When I was in high school and working at a video store, I watched it with a few friends, two of whom are extremely devout, and we get to the end and they just go, \u201cI don\u2019t see what the big deal was.\u201d\n\nThe best we\u2019ve ever been able to figure out is that it\u2019s not a word-of-God, verse by verse recounting from the Bible, and it suggests that Jesus was \u2026 to say it paints him as imperfect isn\u2019t quite accurate. He\u2019s tempted, but he doesn\u2019t succumb. I would suppose that the suggestion is that any mortal man probably would have, but not Jesus.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those things where people just freak out when someone suggests maybe not every word in the Bible is absolutely true. It\u2019s like how they don\u2019t realize that the parable of the Good Samaritan is just that: A parable. It\u2019s the Biblical equivalent of a Facebook story that ends with, \u201cAnd then everybody clapped.\u201d Several years back, these people complained about Reza Aslan\u2019s book \u2018Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth,\u2019 because they said a Muslim can\u2019t write about Jesus, but it\u2019s a damn good book. They didn\u2019t read it; they just looked at the name and the author\u2019s skin color and his bio (in that order) and declared him ineligible, when I\u2019ve bought the book for several friends and they all say it reinforces whatever faith they have. The Christians believe it makes a powerful case for the existence of Jesus. The atheists believe it doesn\u2019t. The agnostics go, \u201cIt\u2019s a nice story.\u201d\n\nAnd I feel that\u2019s what Last Temptation is like. Maybe it challenges the viewer, but that\u2019s a good thing. Your faith *should* be rocked every so often. It\u2019s a film that invites reflection and discussion afterwards. Not one single person in the past three and a half decades has ever watched Last Temptation and said, \u201cThat\u2019s it! I\u2019m no longer a Christian!\u201d There\u2019s no danger to it. It isn\u2019t sacrilege; just another point of view.",

And the original 1971 version of **Silence**. And **Barabbas** too. \n\nPersonally I found **Passion** to be offensively violent, and would watch any of those other films any day. You might draw the line at **The Devils**, though, although if I had a church library it would be there too.",

Although the telling is fairly straight, the simple idea of transplanting the story across time and space gives it a unique flavor as it draws parallels from the original text to the sociopolitical problems South Africa faces.\n\nThe Miracle Maker: A Welsh-Russian stop motion animated film that does a better job of condensing the Christ story into a palatable 90 mins than any of its live action counter parts, without being overwrought or too heavy handed. It even injects 2D animation into the story for more emotional moments. Beautiful stuff.\n\nI second the person who said Gospel of St. Matthew, which is a great example of a fairly controversial filmmaker making a shockingly faithful and down to earth telling of the Christ story! For me it really sells the idea of Jesus as a grassroots revolutionary of his time, keeping it real, and with its unusual but striking imagery frames the raw biblical text as something that is powerful without need for alteration.\n\nAs for a tangential non-Christ movie, I suggest The Mission from 1986, just a moving story about Jesuit missionaries staring DeNiro with an Ennio Morricone score.",

I would get the reviews going of the more standard fare to build your credibility among the congregation as a trust worthy source of information and film opinion. Wait until Scorsese completes the film he has promised to be about Jesus. Then when that is nearing release do a review of Last Temptation and see if there are any requests for it to justify adding it. Or add it for the sole purpose of review before the new film releases. Maybe even add a slip to the cover about the film being a non-biblical biography of cultural significance. That's what I would do.",

                            "comment": "Some important things that Reeves touched on that I think should be mentioned are:\n\n-Batman is in the second year of his career, meaning...\n\n-Villains are just starting out without their known aliases. Selina Kyle isn't Catwoman yet, Oswald Cobblepot isn't Penguin, and Edward Nash isn't Riddler (or whatever he'll call himself) yet. And yes his name is Edward Nash, not Nigma, as apparently that's one of his original names that fit the tone of the movie better.\n\n-Batman is still rough around the edges (like *reaallly* rough as you can see from that last fight scene) and still building himself up to be the hope of Gotham. So the general citizen and policeman still see him as a crazed vigilante. Based on how Reeves worded it, he's working himself to be more \"heroic\" over time rather than a blunt instrument on crime. He's still young and angry.\n\n-A key part of the plot is the surmounting corruption in Gotham. It's what intertwines Batman, Catwoman, Carmine Falcone, Penguin, the GCPD, and others together. It's the core motivation of Riddler's crimes and the mystery of the story.\n\nEdit: One more I forgot to mention after rewatching his interview - Apparently, Riddler's crimes revolving around corruption might also implicate the secret history of Gotham. And might also include Bruce's parents (which sounds something similar to the Telltale Games and some lesser known versions of the Waynes in the comics). More importantly, this movie will only *touch* on the origin, but it's not an origin movie again.\n\nI love the fact that we get to tackle the more corruptive aspects of Gotham more. We definitely got to see some corruption at work in Batman Begins, but here's where it takes center stage. Batman's methods alone aren't enough to solve crime in Gotham, but neither is Bruce Wayne's philanthropy alone. It takes both to root out the deep rooted corruption in Gotham to get anything solved.",

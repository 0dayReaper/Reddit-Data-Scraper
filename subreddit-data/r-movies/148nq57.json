    "postText": "With the exception of 3D and IMAX, there's very few gimmicks built around theatrical experiences as there were pre-1970s. On occasion you might get something like Million Dollar Mystery (quality notwithstanding) where it promised a chance to win money by seeing the movie, but for the most part those kinds of gimmicks of the Hitchcock or William Castle variety are mostly dead. What's a gimmick you wish would make a comeback? For me personally I'd bring back the Psycho: \"No one will be seated after the start of the movie\".",

We've also seen 'live' concerts and other one night only viewings that I don't recall being done in the 70s.\n\nThe prevalence of post credit scenes is a more modern gimmick as well",

It\u2019s just that he works all the time and you get the same generic execution. \n\nHe\u2019s been playing Nick Fury ever since the first Iron Man (2008) and he\u2019s had some ho-hum action movie roles here and there. So when was the last time he showed off his acting chops? The Hateful Eight? A Time to Kill? Pulp Fiction?",

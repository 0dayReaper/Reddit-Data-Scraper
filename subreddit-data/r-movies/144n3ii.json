Sicario was my favorite movie of all time when it came out, then hell or high water was, and I really loved wind river.\n\nI\u2019m just saying Sheridan spread himself too thin as a writer. He\u2019s writing like 10 shows right now and it\u2019s insane lol. His movies were some of the greatest movies in that genre by a long shot. I wish he\u2019d do that again. If he was just writing one show, he\u2019d be able to crank out a new movie every few years and I\u2019d be happy",

The showrunner is the head writer and has final say, whether they\u2019re credited as such or not, but in very few cases are they actually writing every word.\n\nI\u2019ve heard Bill Lawrence, the showrunner of Ted Lasso, Scrubs and others, say that almost everyone credited as a producer on a TV show is really a writer, and as they gain experience they take different titles but their responsibilities don\u2019t change much.",

I can get with that.",

Splitting it into two films was the right call.",

Martin Sensmeier is the only returning cast member, and Jason Clarke, Scott Eastwood and Chaske Spencer are joining him. The Falcon And The Winter Soldier helmer Kari Skogland is directing. Filming is already underway in Canada.\n\nI'm somewhat astounded that so much of Sheridan's stuff gets franchised. I get that Yellowstone was a hit and the prequels make sense.

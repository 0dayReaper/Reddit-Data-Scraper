Watch any videos of games from the late 2000s, they're all ugly brown and grey and green. I don't know what was the deal with that era, all the action / FPS type games had this ugly colour scheme to them where everything is this muddy featureless mess for some reason. It's only in the early 2010s that we got some colour back.",

It looks like a different game when you remove its filter.",

Sometimes, I am able to remember when it came out but a lot of times I get a feel of how it was shot and how it was edited.

Aliens for example feels like an early 90s  action movie the way it is shot and edited and not an 80s movie.  James Cameron's movies all feel like they are 5-10 years early.  It is like though there are very few independent editors and most are copying each other's styles and editing fomat.",

However, the resources and techniques available increase rapidly, so what was realistic 10 years ago looks like dogshit now compared to what we would deem realistic today. Just the nature of trying to imitate reality.\n\nBut when you have a specific, non-realistic art style, so long as you can do it justice with the tech you have when making the game it will still hold up well later, because the style is still the style. People might say it's an old and boring style, but if you like it it looks no worse today compared to 10 years ago.",

There was a lot of late 90\u2019s movie influence on what determined \u201caction\u201d in gaming in the 2000\u2019s.\n\nSPR was a 180 turn from the bright popcorn action of the 80\u2019s, and it defined war realism for a long time (and still does at times). Call of Duty, which in turn defined most shooters for 15 years, was shamelessly ripping that aesthetic and trying to capture that same mood by saturating the grays and browns.\n\nMovies like Gladiator and 300 also played a huge role in making audiences expect gritty action to involve strong filters and muted palettes.\n\nThings like World of Warcraft started to bring it back to actual art, but it\u2019s really taken all the way to things like Minecraft and Fortnight before wide open style choices were acceptable again.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019m currently playing Diablo, and grimdark definitely isn\u2019t going away anytime soon.  It\u2019s really good at setting a mood.",

Or how a major plot point of Tomorrow Never Dies, from 1997, is that the villain stole stealth materials and they think he might be building a stealth plane (remember how cool stealth planes were!?).",

For starters, I didn\u2019t see the movie until I was 28 years old, but somehow, even watching it for the first time, it made me *super* nostalgic for it, like it was a movie that I had grown up watching. Even weirder is that it makes me feel nostalgic for being a high schooler in the 80\u2019s\u2026 but I was born in 1985. So the movie somehow is so deeply steeped in nostalgia that it almost implanted false memories of me having seen it dozens of times and having been in high school in the year I was born.",

I absolutely love James Bond as well. \n\nBut I think the difference is not whether things are old in a movie, but whether they've stood the test of time. Going to your digital watch example: we still use digital watches nowadays (albeit on a much smaller scale) and we all know what they are. We grok them. They're a part of us and we relate to them just as we did when they were more widespread. Seeing one in a movie makes me go \"oh, they've been around for THAT long?!\". And even today, it's not that much of a susprise to see someone wear a digital watch, so the watches don't seem dated, unless it's a vintage Casio, in which case I have to say they have excellent taste.\n\nThe AOL thing, though, it was lightning in a bottle. It came and it went away. Some of us have never even used it, since we grew up in other parts of the world where the A in AOL was not relevant since we had different means to connect to the interwebz and, hence, used different chat platforms (sidenote: whaddup' my Yahoo! homies?).\n\nOf course, it's a gamble when choosing to include contemporary elements, as you have no idea how they'll age. Or maybe the producers don't actually concern themselves with such details, since a movie is supposed to be relevant now, not 20 years later or more.",

Is a movie supposed to feel current forever? \n\nAs someone who is a huge fan of 60s-80s horror, I love and embrace the badly aged films. \n\nBut if we're guessing why people don't want a movie to age I think it's because the truly great movies don't really date. Something like Alien or In The Mood for Love, The Thing, Raiders of the Lost Arc or Godfather still look and play as well as they did when they were released. \n\nAdmitting a movie hasn't aged well is partly admitting that it wasn't a great movie to begin with. Which someone people don't like, there is nothing wrong with enjoying movies that aren't critical darlings or high art, enjoy what you enjoy.",

The only egregious thing is filming Nadia, and even that became prescient in issues with teens/social media. The friend groups and relationships are dead on. as well as showing teenage boys\u2019 insecurities at that age. Also, the teen girls in the movie (outside Nadia) all have their own agency and aren\u2019t just some objects to move the plot forward. Way more nuance than it gets credit for.",

One thing that makes for a good movie is the character arc--not just the protagonist achieving his goals but also changing himself in the process. Like learning a valuable lesson or discovering a strength he didn't know he had, that kind of thing. \n\nFBDO is interesting in that FB remains exactly the same person at the end of the movie as he was at the beginning. That ought to make for a mediocre movie, but it doesn't: instead of Ferris, we see both Cameron and Jeanie go through believable transformations in the third act. Cameron finally finds the courage to stand up for himself, and presumably snaps out of his depression, while Jeanie learns to stop worrying about things she can't control (ie how her brother always gets away with stuff) and to just live her own life.\n\nAnd they both learned that from FB. It's an unorthodox plot but they nailed it.\n\n I'll add in his defense this line from Grace, Mr. Rooney's secretary: \"Oh, he's very popular Ed. The sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wastoids, dweebies, dickheads - they all adore him. They think he's a righteous dude.\"\n\nWould a narcissist asshole be popular with this many cliques? None of the NAs I've known have been but who knows.",

Yep, and don't forget the smoking section is up the stairs. There's a full-blown pizza restaurant in the mall, which isn't the food court. That's a separate area. Damone is scalping paper tickets. What's a paper ticket? Everyone's dressed like they just stepped out of an 80s music video. Wait, what's a music video? Ron works at a stereo store. A what store? What do they sell there? Well let's just swing by the arcade. That's a place that has video games you can play for a quarter. And there's a nice pan past some very flat butts in designer jeans. It's all just glorious!",

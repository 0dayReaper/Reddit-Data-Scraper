Given the stylistic similarities, it looks like when that project got cancelled he re-worked what he had into this.~~\n\nedit. Sorry, these are damned lies. I tried to find sources to backup my memories, but turns out all I was remembering were rumors. I can find no source that definitively names Del Torro as officially being apart of the cancelled Bioshock movie. I did however find an article interview with Del Torro where he does say he was a huge fan of the game and would be happy to be apart of any film adaption. This is likely the source of the rumor. ",

So, what do you do? You pick it up and jam it right into your forearm and inject all that glowing blue stuff into you. \n\nThat part has never made sense to me.\n\nEdit: people were asking, so I watched a couple Let's Play videos and they are never told to inject themselves. The only thing I got wrong was that it's a bright red liquid, not blue... although I just searched and found another redditor asking the same question, and they called it a blue liquid too.

Could be but I don't think so because just look at the creature, he looks just like Abe.  Also there is an intelligence factor to this creature, Abe was super intelligent and thoughtful, this creature does look \"like\" Abe but almost younger in a way, also when she plays the music the creature does a very familiar \"back flip\" swim thing in the tank, just like in Hellyboy, I think it is Abe Sapien, just a young Abe.

It just dropped the post with the line \"hey it's Guillermo\" and ran off. Meanwhile the official Twitter and Facebook accounts for the movie have shared the same poster.\n\nAnd even if he did verify it's him, if he isn't in the thread participating and taking questions, then this is no better than a celebrity using Twitter as their platform for advertising.

That was my personal favorite), sometimes it's dinosaur hybrids (I remember an ankylosaurus crossed with a triceratops he called an ankylotops).  \n\nBut his main thing is different variations on giant monsters.  He LOVED Pacific Rim and Godzilla.  He likes to do different versions of Godzilla where he combines him with his favorite super heroes.  He's done all the Guardians of the Galaxy, all the MCU Avengers, every X-Man.\n\nI honestly don't know what to do with all these drawings.\n\nEdit:\n\nHad some requests to see some stuff...  Here are just few things I happen to have on my phone from pictures I took to send to family members...\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/JQLLY\n\nFirst I figured I'd put on the artist himself.  Chillin in his Teen Titans Go! shirt.\n\nNext is a spread I made after finding a stack of these on my kitchen counter.  Top row is Bumblebee and Optimus Prime.  \n\nSecond row is an Orca Godzilla, some kind of skunk monster (?), Pterodactyl, then an Incredible Hulk Godzilla.\n\nThird Row: Honestly not sure.  The second one I know is a Girl Godzilla we had to convince him to draw.  He's seven so anything girlish is a big no-go.\n\nFourth Row:  Iron Man Godzilla, then the rest I'm not sure.\n\nNext pic down is a picture he drew of Gollum that I loved...\n\nThen we get into the Guardians of the Galaxy.  First is Drax Godzilla, Groot Godzilla, Rocket Godzilla.  Then below it's Ego, Yondu and Star Lord. ",

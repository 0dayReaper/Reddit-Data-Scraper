Then I watched a few acting seminars/interviews with Michael Cain (and some people whom I respected talked about their favorite actors), and then got to really delve into it and watch some stellar performances from people who basically play \"them self\" but as a character and I gained a new respect for actors who just act \"normal\". \n\nI fucking Love Paul Giamati, he's one of the ones that at first you think, \"psh he just plays a normal guy\" but really his chops are fucking fantastic.  \n\nI always think of that when people are typecasted/said to play themself/etc.  ",

That's one of the earliest roles I can remember him in aside from Pig Vomit, and I remember thinking he had range that wasn't being used.\n\n*John Adams* proved it.",

I then promptly binged the whole 2 seasons with my wife.\n\nI've talked to people who could not stand Galavant. I think some people just hate musicals. Also, the fantasy setting threw people off. While I enjoy both things, I feel that if this had been set in modern New York or similar it likely would have done better. \n\nI got to say, I really liked a lot about Galavant, but it was a bit uneven at times, and felt some of the jokes just felt out of time (especially the gay bar scene that felt straight out of the 80s). \n\nI still wish they would get a new season.",

That way people would have to get up and walk to the TV and manually turn the volume up a little at a time over and over again over the course of the full episode (this was pre remote controls). Then at the very end of the episode they wanted to have a full volume loud noise to scare the audience. BBC apparently said no because it would blow out the speakers in everyone\u2019s TVs. ",

The second players found out there was such an \"easy quest\" available they mobbed him with money. He then claimed he was \"\"the opposite of mugged\". \n\nI *loved* that bit, but to explain it to an average movie-goer would be almost impossible. I don't see a big studio making a movie about it.   \n\nThis premise seeks to involve a \"hyper violent shooter\" game, which I think large audiences can identify.",

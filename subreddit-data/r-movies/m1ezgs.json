Jeremy Irons is playing the father of Adam Driver's character, Rodolfo Gucci.\n\nAl Pacino is most likely playing Aldo Gucci, Rodolfo's older brother, and the father of Paolo Gucci, Jared Leto's character. Paolo was first cousin to Maurizio Gucci, Driver's character.\n\nThe Guccis were semi-like a mafia family, and Adam Driver said that one of his favorite movies growing up was *The Godfather*, so it makes sense why he said yes to this movie.",

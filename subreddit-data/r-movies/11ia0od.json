Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.\u201d ~ Calvin Coolidge",

Not sure if you\u2019ll ever read this or reply, but this is likely my only shot so I\u2019ll take it.\n\nThank you for being such an amazing human being. Clearly you have endured a lot in your life and have still managed to navigate fame with humility, sincerity, class, and sincere kindness. You are a true inspiration and I admire the hell out of you. I am truly sorry for the pain you have endured. Thank you for emerging from it still kind at heart, always willing to help out anyone and everyone you can, and for never taking yourself too seriously. Such a refreshing take from a Hollywood star.\n\nI could ramble on and on forever about how much I admire you, but I will spare you that. On the off chance you read this, thank you for being you and please keep on being that person. Wishing you happiness, joy, continued success and good health",

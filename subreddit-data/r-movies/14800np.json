    "postText": "I ask this because there is a strict Pakistani actor ban in India (horribly prejudiced) but in \u2018What\u2019s Love Got To Do With It\u2019 Shabana Azmi a prominent Indian actor worked with Sajal Aly a prominent Pakistani actor and it was helmed by Shehkar Kapur, a maker of Indian classics. So now my question lies in was this allowed since Working Title produced it, what would occur if there was a hybrid production with say Bhansali productions collaborating with say NEON (extremely hypothetical) would Pakistani actors be allowed in such a situation or not.",

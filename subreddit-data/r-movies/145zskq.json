    "postText": "OK, I just watched Fast X, and I cannot believe that the CGI is for a $300+M budget movie, is this for real? Even if this is the total budget for both parts, this still puts it in the top 10 most expensive movies. I've seen Youtube videos with literary no budget with better CGI. Not talking about the plot and storyline, but the actual special effects, CGI. Seriously how can it be so bad?",

The detail and depth of the CGI was good. Some of the car physics in the Vatican sequence were pretty wonky, but then again, when was the last scene where car physics were realistic in a Fast movie? In 6, Dom jumps off one car over a canyon to catch Letty mid-air and land on another car, \"breaking\" his landing. The laws of physics are more like guidelines than actual rules.",

They also used practical effects much more than they do now. Fast X feels pretty cheap by comparison, although some of the VFX were spot on. The acting seem worse than usual as well, especially the side characters. I'm assuming Justin Lin leaving had some major ramifications in quality.",

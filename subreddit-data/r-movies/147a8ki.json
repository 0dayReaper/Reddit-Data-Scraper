            "comment": "Terminator 2 teaser trailer - seeing the terminator being assembled and going into the bio-flesh regenerator was epic. It didnt give away anything about the film and it felt like an extension of the first film.\n\nHighlander:Endgame (FX trailer) - It made me so hyped because it advertised a film that seemed really grand in scope. Like it was the big finale of the franchise. The actual movie wasnt much like the trailer , but to this day the trailer still seems entertaining.\n\nHighlander 3:The Sorcerer trailer - its again another example of a trailer depicting a really big movie with a certain vibe and tone. It used the title font of the tv series and it had some nifty music. The actual film wasnt as good. \n\nCase 39 - the trailer is unique because it depicts the film with a very specific plot. That a little girl is being pursued by a demonic presence. Even including specific scenes that showcase that plot. The actual film was very different in structure. What I find very unique about this instance, is that there were complete scenes shot specifically for the advertising promotion that go with the premise that this little girl is in fact the victim. While in the actual film the scenes look re-edited to go with the movie's actual plot. I'd never seen that before, where theres actually 2 versions of certain scenes. Actually in full, not just little snippets. Yet no one ever talks about the movie or the trailer. Though some were convinced that there was in fact a complete alternate cut of the film. Some even insisted they saw that alternate cut at screenings , but theres been no evidence of that.",

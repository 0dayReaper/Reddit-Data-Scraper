The list of stuff that gets standing ovations or boos and walkouts is as strange as the Cannes Film Festival itself. I wouldn't take it too seriously.\n\nIf I did take it too seriously, I'd say that the audiences at Cannes see themselves as cinema purists and would say that the only way to see movies is on the big screen, which isn't Netflix's primary platform. Netflix's movie production has also been lackluster compared to their work in episodic TV (so far.) The trailer to Okja, the film that was stopped partially due to non-stop booing, also looks like it could be a total mess (but man, oh man, do I want to see it.)",

Studios today are much more focused on creating series and franchises. If you look at DreamWorks animation, for example, they're very direct about it.\n\nStandalone flicks being weird, totally. It wasn't that long ago when a movie had to do really well to get a (theatrical) sequel, now a movie has to do really poorly to NOT get a sequel.",

This was great for Blockbuster, as they made the up-front cost of the video back after a few dozen rentals or so, then it was mostly profit from then on. Most customers weren't going to pay that much for a video up front, so off to Blockbuster people went. After a couple months on the rental market, the price for a copy dropped to $15-$20, and then people would buy a copy for themselves. Everybody was more-or-less happy with this arrangement - Blockbuster made their cash, people got to rent and/or buy movies, and the studios got to sell their stuff twice (once to Blockbuster and again to the consumer).\n\nSomewhere in the mid-ninety's this all went to shit. I remember reading somewhere (but can't find the source now) that Blockbuster wanted to pull in even more cash, so they tried strong-arming studios into cutting them a better deal on movies. Studios balked, told Blockbuster to go fuck themselves, and priced movies at $15-$20 upon release, thereby screwing up the whole rent-then-buy model.\n\nAround this time, lots of folks were getting fed up with ridiculous Blockbuster fees, crappy customer service, and Blockbuster trying to turn themselves into a convenience store.\n\nIf Blockbuster had sense, they would have had the foresight to see where the distribution was shifting and put themselves in the middle of it. But no, they clung on to their antiquated model for far too long. By the time they tried to change things (Blockbuster-on-demand, eliminating late fees, etc) Netflix and others had already taken up Blockbusters' slack.\n\nSo while the 'digital age' may have helped to put Blockbuster under, they really have no one to blame but themselves.",

He got rid of late fees, started blockbuster online, and put kiosks out, and Blockbuster was making the shift from brick and mortar only to online. People loved it. Only problem was, late fees were their bread and butter and this CEO was costing investors a lot of money. So he was fired in 2005 and replaced with a moron who reversed all the previous CEO's actions and went back to their old model and were gone within 5 years. ",

It was not winning them any sympathy in their demise, and many (such as myself) cheered it on.  \n  \n Most of Reddit is probably far too young to remember this, but the fees for returning a DVD a few minutes late were often more than the rental itself.  And before that, so were the fees for returning a VHS which was not *fully* rewound.  \n  \nThe thing is, many times it was the minimum wage employees working the understaffed location who were at fault for not getting the returns checked in on time.  And once the system put a late fee on your account, it was almost impossible to get it removed.  I'd wager than millions of family movie nights and date nights were held hostage by the Blockbuster video monopoly in this manner.  Good riddance.     ",

He was saying how in the 70s - 80s a movie theater might run 2 movies for the whole summer.  September was typically a slow month with back to school etc. and it was typical that no major studio releases were out the whole month.  Now if a movie doesn't make back 150 million in the first 2 weeks its a failure.  When I was a kid, I feel like a movie ticket was about the same as minimum wage, but now it seems like its almost double.  And it used to be almost like the cheapest source of entertainment.  Now it seems like almost a luxury.  Its amazing thinking back, you could get 4 people to meet up outside a theater, without cell phones to go see a movie.  ",

For the longest time our biggest commercial cinema in the city was steadily increasing ticket prices until they reached around the $20 each mark. Then about a year or so ago they decided to drop every ticket no matter age or time of day (except 3D is a little more), down to $10. It seems to have paid off well as I think the stigma of not being able to afford to go to the movies has relaxed a lot and it's now much more accessible again.",

We just go out to dinner beforehand and try not to buy any other concessions in the theater, maybe just a soda.\n\nSo check around for special deals, and in case you have at&amp;t here's their deal i mentioned: https://tickettwosdays.att.com\n\nedit: list of regal discount days:\n\nhttps://www.regmovies.com/promotions/regal-value-days#Virginia",

I have a large screen TV and surround system and going to the theater **used to be** the only way you could enjoy movies. When I was younger it seemed like it took a while before a movie left the theater and came out for rental, now the turnaround is only a few months. \n\nI like to go to the theater for event movies like Star Wars or Guardians of the Galaxy but I really don't need to see something like a comedy in a theater. It's just not that big of a deal to me, I think the next movie I will see in the theater because I want to see it on a really big screen is Dunkirk.",

            "comment": "\"...blame should go to the major studios....\"\n\nYeah blame everyone except the audience!\n\nLook, if there's one lesson from the past 30 years it's that convenience wins every time. Sprint used to run commercials about how their lines were so clear you could hear a pin drop. Their **land lines**. Does anyone care about land lines anymore? Nope. We've got cell phones now and even though the quality is *completely shit* no one cares because it's so convenient.\n\nNetflix is simply more convenient than theaters. Theaters are more expensive, require planning, you can only watch what they choose to show, when they choose to show it, you can't pause the movie in a theater, you can't talk, use you phone, rewind. Stop it in the middle and have dinner and come back to it tomorrow. \n\nAnd if you realize you don't like the movie 30 minutes into it, too bad! You're fucked! That's your money wasted.\n\nIt's ridiculous how everyone complains about how awful the theatrical experience is (oh someone was texting! Oh tickets are so expensive!) and then acts like somehow it's the fucking **studio's** fault that no one's going to the movies? Come on. \n\nThe studios make the movies proven to get audiences off their ass and into the theater. That means  movies that are **low risk**. People talk about \"franchises\" but really it's not *any* franchise, it's specifically those franchises that package familiar content with showstopping spectacle. **That's** what gets people out of their homes. The promise that they'll see something familiar, turned up to 11.\n\nSomething familiar but low-key? Pass. Something turned up to 11 they've never seen before? I'll watch it when it's on blu-ray. \n\nThis is the bed we made for ourselves, no use complaining about it. It is 100% not going to change, it's only going to get worse.\n\nJust thank god for Netflix because there'd be no Dark Crystal or mid-tier Brad Pit comedy without it.",

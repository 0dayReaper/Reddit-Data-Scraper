Coming up with nothing, this prompted director Josh Cooley to more seriously flesh out Duke Caboom as a person.[2] Continuing the trend, Keanu was the originator of Duke's signature compulsion to do poses, acting out poses on top of a table which producers found to be quintessentially \"Duke Caboom\".",

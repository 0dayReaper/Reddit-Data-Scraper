    "postText": "I'm curious as to what others think about this, but I do definitely think (even long before it's out) that Tarantino is a likely contender to win the Oscar for Best Director. He claims this'll be his final one, so I wonder if by default he has a shot in that category as a nod to his whole career. This is probably an absurd point to make for something which hasn't even begun filming yet, but it's interesting to consider. Have there been any other directors like that, who got Oscars for directing more as a career nod?",

Who couldn\u2019t root for a former slave killing a particularly vile enslaver? Or Ving Rahmes going medieval on the guys who almost made him their gimp? Or Brad Pitt stopping the Manson family and their bloody murders?\n\nYou get the point.\n\nAnyway, I find his new film being about a movie critic totally hilarious.",

I honestly don't know if Tarantino would get it, because he simply doesn't make the \"oscar recipe\" kind of movies. He never has. So them gray haired people voting/not watching his movie, don't really give a shit. \n\nAlso, there's the part that Tarantino isn't that old. Okay he seems to be 60, but still. So they aren't in a hurry to do the kind of \"last honors\" thing. I don't think anyone really believes he will quit doing movies. Yes, I'm sure he will do some tv shows inbetween, which will be interesting as hell, but he'll be back it. We all know it.",

If you enjoy psychological horror with great direction and character development, I would highly recommend checking out 'Get Out' and 'Hereditary.' They both offer a unique blend of suspense and storytelling. Another film that might interest you is 'The Witch' (or 'The VVitch'), which has an atmospheric and slow-burn approach.",

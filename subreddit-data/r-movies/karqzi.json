If it had flopped, disney wouldn't have been out as much money. \n\nIn fact, it probably \"hurt\" Disney in the short term to have pixar/disney doing so well without really owning the IP. Hence why Disney chose to flat out purchase Pixar later.\n\nDisney now a funny company. They always seem to go in cycles, but always somehow pick up and do better.\n\nI think the same cycle happened with their Star Wars acquisition, but signs point to them figuring it out finally.",

Lucas didn't see much potential in one of the ILM's division and Steve Jobs bought it.

Or is it animated to them, like Itchy and Scratchy are to the Simpsons?\n\nEdit: and if it is live action for them, it means there is an actor walking around in the Toy Story universe who likes like Buzz (but eg. With hair, maybe a beard, and normal clothes) and sounds like Chris Evans. And maybe that actor is putting on an accent for the part of Buzz and is... Australian, ...or French.\n\nEdit2: it also means that the voice Andy hears saying \u201cto infinity.. and beyond!\u201d when he presses the button on toy Buzz (which also happens to be Buzz\u2019s voice) was recorded onto toy Buzz by a voice actor who sounds like Tim Allen, who doesn\u2019t necessarily look anything like Buzz. He might even look like Tim Allen?! This means that the in-universe toy maker couldn\u2019t afford to hire the actor who looks like Buzz (and sounds like Chris Evans) to do the recording for the toy, and picked someone that sounds nothing like him.\n\nEdit3: or maybe we\u2019re about to find out that Chris Evans Buzz voice is almost exactly like Tim Allen Buzz voice. Maybe this.",

The one from the original media that can fly and shoot lasers. That's where Buzz and Zurg all come from. It used to be that original media was the old TV show from the early 2000s. Now it's going to be this movie and the TV show is probably going to be non-canon. The Buzz video game you talk about in Toy Story 2 was meant to have been a game based on the TV show/film",

So I think in the Toy Story universe this is a blockbuster movie about Buzz and the Star Command movie is a direct-to-TV sequel. In our universe we just received the two backwards. That also explains why this movie is 3D-animated and Star Command is 2D-animated; everything in the Toy Story universe is 3D animated which implies that to those characters this movie is live action. It also explains why Buzz is SUCH a popular toy in their universe; this elevates the character from GI Joe status to Iron Man status.",

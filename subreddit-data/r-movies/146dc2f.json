From Up on Poppy Hill is also up there, I think it's one of the better Ghibli movies but it's usually passed over.  The Secret World of Arietty is from 2010 I think and it's pretty fun too, though I wouldn't say it's one of my favorite Ghibli movies.  I haven't seen The Wind Rises but I've heard good things and it's on my to-watch list.\n\nShinkai movies: Weathering With You is my favorite, which is not common I realize but I think it has a better structure than Your Name or Suzume; both of which are good but I don't think they come together as well as WWY.",

So, instead, I\u2019ll give you what I think are the best anime films from each of those 15 years, and then my personal Top 5.\n\nI\u2019ll give myself some caveats, though: you\u2019re probably going to watch Makoto Shinkai\u2019s other films anyway, and Studio Ghibli is too easy. So, with that out of my way:\n\nMy Personal Top 5:\n- A Silent Voice (Naoko Yamada, 2016)\n- Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms (Mari Okada, 2018) [One of my favourite films of all time]\n- Night is Short, Walk on Girl (Masaaki Yuasa, 2017)\n- Pompo the Cin\u00e9phile (Takayuki Hirao, 2021)\n- Wolf Children (Mamoru Hosoda, 2012)\n\nAnd here\u2019s my yearly breakdown:\n\n- 2009: Redline (Takeshi Koike)\n- 2010: The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya (Tatsuyuki Ishihara &amp; Yasuhiro Takemoto)\n- 2011: K-On! The Movie (Naoko Yamada) [Really fun movie but it\u2019s a franchise one - weak year tbh]\n- 2012: Wolf Children (Mamoru Hosoda)\n- 2013: Patema Inverted (Yasuhiro Yoshiura)\n- 2014: Giovanni\u2019s Island (Mizuho Nishikubo)\n- 2015: Miss Hokusai (Keiichi Hara)\n- 2016: A Silent Voice (Naoko Yamada)\n- 2017: Night is Short, Walk on Girl (Masaaki Yuasa)\n- 2018: Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms (Mari Okada). Honourable mention goes to Liz and the Bluebird (Naoko Yamada)*\n- 2019: PROMARE (Hiroyuki Imaishi)\n- 2020: Josee, the Tiger and the Fish (Kotaro Tamura)**\n- 2021: Summer Ghost (loundraw) / BELLE (Mamoru Hosoda)***\n- 2022: Goodbye, Don Glees! (Atsuko Ishizuka)\n\n*Because 2023 films haven\u2019t released internationally yet, have two amazing picks from 2018. It was a stacked year tbh.\n\n** 2020 saw *Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie - Mugen Train* make global headlines as the highest grossing movie of the year. It\u2019s great, but I wouldn\u2019t go into it without having seen the first season of the TV series first.\n\n*** Summer Ghost is only about 40 minutes long, so whether you count it as a short film or feature is up to you. So have two recommendations.",

My all-time favourite animated and anime movie and unfortunately nigh impossible to recommend to anyone since they'll probably need to watch two seasons of the show including the Endless Eight arc (or you know, watch two of the episodes and you get the idea).\n\nYou're right. Bold, ambitious, beautifully animated, amazing performances and just has a feel to it that's hard to describe. The first part after the world shift has such a sense of gloom and despair to it that's so well reflected in the colour palette of each scene. When we see Haruhi, there's hope again (and her first scene is so tense and a breath of relief!), and once again there's so much more colour in the movie. Kyon's choice is probably one my favourite movie scene ever. Just about everything went right with this movie, which was incredible unexpected considering the second part of the second season. \n\nI will literally gush over this movie forever.",

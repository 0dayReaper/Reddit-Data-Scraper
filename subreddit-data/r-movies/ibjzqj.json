It was actually intended to be a sequel to a Frank Sinatra movie(can't remember the name right now) and the original Die Hard script was based off the sequel to the book that the Sinatra movie was based on(hope that makes sense)\n\nIn fact, due to contractual obligations, the studio was actually required to offer the lead character part to Sinatra first. When he turned it down due to being to old to star in an action movie, the script was overhauled and the title changed.\n\nIn other words, there's an alternate universe out there where we got to see Frank Sinatra deliver the \"Hippy Ki-Yay Motherfucker\" line to Allen Rickman.",

Not since Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire has his characters ever once used extensive ebonics or urban language. He enunciates properly, and uses little slang, or if he does, he exaggerates it extremely, to make sure you know its him using slang knowingly, not that it's part of his common vernacular. The reason being is he doesn't go into the idea that that's all black people are. He's spoken on it a few times how he often will not take roles like Denzel, despite being offered them. You can watch any Denzel movie, and he'll often speak exactly where he came from: the streets of New York. He's not afraid to say 'amberlance' or 'axe' you a question. Smith did not come from the streets. He was raised Baptist in Pennsylvania and went to private school his whole life. So it makes sense. You're asking him to imitate something he's not, he won't do it because he doesn't have to. Denzel however, he literally was a step away from being a banger in New York. He knows what it's like to be a hoodlum. Pretty cool contrast between the two, but I've always respected Smith's take on why he doesn't do that, and respected how nobody has ever asked Denzel to explain why he speaks like, or rather, why he can speak like that so believably.",

You'd have to watch him in early Guy Ritchie stuff to know \"hey, that's Al Capone from Boardwalk Empire\" or \"hey, that's Tony Pro from the Irishman\". Heck, he took a step back toward his roots as Atticus in \"Taboo\" (with Tom Hardy, who also has his share of accent work).  \n\n\nAnother one to give credit to is Benedict Wong. Guy spoke heavy as anything playing Kubkai Khan in Marco Polo and as Wong in the Marvelverse (Doctor Strange/Avengers Infinity War and Endgame), but he's also very British.",

But in American Pie, when John Cho\u2019s character ended up being a drugged out pothead, I was oddly proud, as that character far more resembled my fellow Asian American friends, more so than the nerd trope. So even though it was a small role where he played a dumb character, the fact that it didn\u2019t hang on mocking Asian Americans, I was extremely happy and proud.",

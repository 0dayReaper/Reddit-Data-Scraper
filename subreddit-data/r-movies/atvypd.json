Somehow, they look too distractingly \"bold\" to me. I think it's the very tight way the ! and ? cross over. Their openings become too small and the character feels too \"busy\".\n\nIf I'm reading some paragraph, the \u203ds stand out way too much from the rest of the text. Like, try defocusing your eyes, or reading some othe part of the text. The \u203d\u203ds really stand out.\n\nI guess it depends on the font, but at least in my phone, similar characters like $ and &amp; have a lot of space between crossings, making them blend better with the rest of the text. Maybe it's just that since it's not a common character, font designers don't feel the need to optimize them?\n\nAnyway, sorry for the iterrorant.",

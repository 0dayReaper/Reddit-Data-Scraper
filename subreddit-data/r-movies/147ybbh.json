    "postText": "I think mine are brick, momento and night crawler. Probably my fav film of the last decade is nightcrawler, Jake gyllenhaal\u2019s performance I thought was Oscar worthy  and had other solid performances from riz Ahmed and Rene Russo. The opportunistic yet sociopathic thought process of bloom (Jake\u2019s character) yet disturbing was gripping throughout. \n\nOn the flip side you have guy peace piecing together the murder of his wife and Joseph Gordon levitt doing the same with regards to his girlfriend. Both shot fantastically and had me feeling engrossed and I was part of the investigation. \n\nWhat are your fav indie films? \n\nAll three feel fresh when I rewatch them and have that suspenseful investigative plot. What are your fav indie films?",

It was an important distinction in the 90s, but the Weineteins and all those companies became just as powerful as the old studios and the industry settled on this even keel where the only difference between a mainstream movie and an indie is its *vibe.* I assume most people think of A24 productions as indie, despite their actual funding mechanisms.\n\nStill, I know what you mean, and since I can't think of modern examples for the reasons stated above, I'll say True Romance, Hard Eight, Bottle Rocket, and Momento. Kinda the Mount Rushmore of 90s indie.",

While they are both different in themes and plot it sort of felt like the two films from the same period could have been written, directed / shot by the same person.    I\u2019m also very fond of lock stock two smoking barrels.   Guy Ritchie was the first British director that came onto my radar.   I\u2019m a bit sadden his follow his weren\u2019t as good.    It could be a form of confirmation bias but it just felt like the confluence of unique directing, story telling and a completely novel cast from a foreign land made it so good because Snatch, his follow up with Pitt seemed forced and uninspired.    There is something about putting a very popular actor into a role that could have been better served from an unknown.  It\u2019s also kind of the same way people feel about Sixth Sense and how that was a masterpiece and everything M. Night handsome subsequently done bombed.",

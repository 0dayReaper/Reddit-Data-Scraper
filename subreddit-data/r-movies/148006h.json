    "postText": "I loved Ari Folman's The Congress (2013), so when it was announced that his next movie was going to premiere at Cannes, I was very excited. 2021 went by and I didn't see it pop up in any theaters near me nor any streaming services. It's 2023 and it just seems like it's never going to be released in the US at all How could that be the case, when its voice cast includes several young stars from hit shows like House of the Dragon and Hearstopper? It's just crazy to me! Does anyone know how I can legally watch this movie?",

This was in a large AMC.\n\n2nd had a pre-teen who felt the need to explain all of her thoughts on the movie to her mother and then sing along with the parts of the movie she knew. The audio in the movie theater was poorly calibrated as usual for that independent cinema.\n\nCombined ticket cost for me was $30.\n\nSo yeah, I can see the appeal of people wanting to stay at home and spend a little more on a movie. It sucks if you are single, but maybe you can invite those friends over instead of going out and wand them down for electronics to turn off alarms in your own living room.",

I then made back $12 in DMI rewards for seeing The Little Mermaid to use toward a future movie. I also earned another $.70 in Stubs Reward for the out of pocket cost. \n\nI also had a free popcorn/soda for my AMC birthday rewards. I had another free soda from AMC Investor Connect. There were also two free Large Popcorn vouchers on T-Mobile Tuesday\n\nSo 3 tickets, three popcorns, and 2 sodas for $7, with $12.70 earned in reward points. \n\nThis is not a rare combination of deals either. Things were a bit better when Costco had Atom Ticket gift cards for 25% off, basically taking that off all ticket deals after discounts.",

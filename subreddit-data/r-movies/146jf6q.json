One is made on a shoestring budget, is remarkably dry, almost unsettlingly weird, and stars largely unknown talent (and yes, I\u2019m aware Diedrich Bader is Rex and Tina is waterworld girl). The other was made for 65mil, has a solid acting &amp; directorial cred, and relies on slapstick and absurdity for its humor. \n\nAnyways, I love them both, but comparing them is tough. \n\nGun to my head, definitely Step Brothers for overall comedy. Cultural impact? Probably ND, given how revolutionary it was at the time.",

It is also the more well-rounded movie, able to be enjoyed by a wider set of audiences compared to Ferrel's R-rated shtick. \n\nThe only thing SB has on its side is that it will create a higher quantity/intensity of laughter when it is viewed by the right crowd.\n\nOverall, ND wins in a landslide.",

One film is a window into a tiny world that could exist, and feels relatable.   The other film is a window into (for lack of a better term) the Will Farrel dimension, where even it's base premise requires the viewers brain to bend and ignore reality.\n\nThe world of Napoleon Dynamite raises a few questions about it's sillyness, but the world of Step Brothers cannot be questioned or it falls apart.",

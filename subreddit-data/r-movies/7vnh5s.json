It's like arguing over a different actor having played iron man. Sure, there are plenty of actors that could have performed the role, and done well. But Tony stark and Robby J have become synonymous at this point, as he has disappeared into the role (I sometimes say Tony stark in response to \"who is the actor that plays iron man?\") \n\nIt's a credit to these actors and is a load of fun to watch.",

I\u2019ve never not seen reddit put Deadpool posters, teasers, and trailers right to the front page. ",

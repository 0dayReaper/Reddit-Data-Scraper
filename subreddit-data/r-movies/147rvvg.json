    "postText": "Recently watched this movie and I have never noticed eyes pop this much in scenes that aren't focused on that. Particularly there is a scene in the movie with Jake Gyllenhaal, Jonny Lee Miller, and Alexander Ludwig in the colonel's office where it was basically all I could focus on. Am I the only one? Was I just in some weird head space that day? I believe this is a still from that scene but it doesn't do what I'm talking about full justice.\n\n[https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-covenant-jake-gyllenhaal-john-kinley.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=contain&amp;w=1140&amp;h=&amp;dpr=1.5](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-covenant-jake-gyllenhaal-john-kinley.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=contain&amp;w=1140&amp;h=&amp;dpr=1.5)",

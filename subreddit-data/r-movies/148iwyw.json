The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition, novel), whether the work has been published, and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. Under most countries' laws (for example, the United States\\[64\\] and the United Kingdom\\[65\\]), copyrights expire at the end of the calendar year in which they would otherwise expire.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; If the author has been dead more than 70 years, the work is in the public domain in most, but not all, countries.  \nIn 1998, the length of a copyright in the United States was increased by 20 years under the Copyright Term Extension Act. This legislation was strongly promoted by corporations which had valuable copyrights which otherwise would have expired, and has been the subject of substantial criticism on this point.\\[69\\] \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright#Limitations\\_and\\_exceptions",

It's why Winnie the Pooh is a cute cuddly bear in the original books and now he's a murderer in the new movie.\n\nDisney is also very clearly marketing the OG Mickey in this short as Steamboat Willy. This *is* the character from the original. It's not like this is \"Steamship Wally\" who just happens to look and move like Steamboat Willy. It's Steamboat Willy, the version of Mickey that's entering the public domain next year, even if he acts differently in this short.\n\nSo the lawyers going \"Wait, Mickey never did that or acted like that in the original cartoon.\" means nothing, and it's very open and shut that this is (as all of the branding points out) that same character, not a new Mickey. Adding some flair doesn't change that.\n\n&gt;Even if someone tries to use the famous opening frames of Mickey whistling and steering the ship, it'd be scary waters since that's the current Disney Animation logo.\n\nNow this *is* true, but this is trademark trickery, not copyright.",

It's why Winnie the Pooh is a cute cuddly bear in the original books and now he's a murderer in the new movie.\n\nIt's the same as the Sherlock Holmes case. Independent depictions of Sherlock Holmes have to depict Holmes as emotionless, cold, calculating since that's how he was in the original stories that are public domain. The Doyle estate still has the rights over stories that depict him as growing and having emotions, so they sue anyone that has Sherlock showing emotions. \n\nIn that same way, if this new Steamboat Willie has Mickey \"stretching his legs to get tall for a visual gag\" and he never did that in the original cartoon, and someone depicts their Steamboat Willie stretching his legs, that's something where Disney could argue \"you're not using the original Steamboat Willie. He never did that. Ours does that.\" \n\nI understand that the mere basis of using a copyrighted character differently from the original public domain work isn't a grounds to get sued. That's the whole basis of how Disney Studios made movies like Snow White/Cinderella to begin with. But the characters/depictions Disney used in those adaptations are protected and it's why studios have to be careful to not infringe upon Disney when they make their own Snow White/Cinderella movies.\n\nI'm not sure who would have sued over a depiction of a killer Winnie-The-Pooh. That had never been done before. If you yourself now tried to make a killer Pooh movie that was clearly copied the design/characterization of the existing killer Pooh you might be able to be sued over that.",

Especially considering all the trademark stuff would make it a nightmare to market.\n\nI think we'll see a lot of no-name outlets using the character for shock-value projects similar to the killer Winnie-the-Pooh movie. I think in those cases Disney won't bother, because they're one of the few companies that seem to understand how the Streisand effect works.",

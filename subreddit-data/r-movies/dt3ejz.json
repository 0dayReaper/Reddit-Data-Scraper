I\u2019m not saying some live action actors can\u2019t do good voice acting, it\u2019s just a completely different thing. Go watch or listen to any interview by a voice actor about this issue and they all say the same thing. \n\nLook at James Arnold Taylor for example, they nearly passed him up for the voice of Ratchet in the recent Ratchet and Clank movie. Even the [box art/movie poster](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91kY9VFfJYL._SL1500_.jpg) for the movie has him credited 5th. The main character of the game and movie is listed 5th. \n\nThere is such a divide in Hollywood with voice actors. They are misjudged and thought of as not being \u201creal\u201d actors when they work as hard or harder than on-screen actors do. It\u2019s a shame because people like JAT, Jim Cummings, Jennifer Hale, Steve Blum, etc. are all fantastic voice actors who get shafted because Hollywood thinks that they can sell these animated movies on popular names alone.",

Hasbro formally apologized to him and Welker for the screwjob they pulled with the '86 movie, killing off their characters as they read the script for the first time during the voice recording session. They had to beg them to come back. Both men did, but once again Hasbro was up to their shenanigans when Peter found out one night at Botcon 2007 that they were using his voice in the 2007 movie toys, like the Optimus Prime voice changer helmet, without telling him or compensating him. At first the toys, like the Optimus Prime voice changer helmet, shipped with some internal Hasbro Va bozo's voice poorly sounding like Optimus. Then after a little while before the movie debuted on July 4th 2007, Hasbro made a running change to the toy and substituted in Peter's real movie Optimus Prime voice lines. Other merchandise like electronic keychains that played Optimus Prime phrases also made the same change. The very next day at Botcon, Peter was seen entering a restaurant of the Westin Hotel during its closed hours with Hasbro President Brian Goldner, presumably to resolve this matter. Yes, everyone tries to screw over real voice actors somewhere along the way, even Toy companies that recently tried to make amends for past grievances, they still can be untrustworthy. Luckily the matter was resolved since we've had many, many more toys featuring Peter's Optimus Prime voice since the 2007 toy line.",

    "postText": "First off I want to say that I did enjoy the movie but oh my God the world building in this series is pretty horrible. In my opinion. Nothing is really consistent and honestly each movie just seems to throw ridiculous nonsense in. A whole entire secret society might as well be a whole entire different parallel reality coexisting in the same space. Hardly anyone reacts to what\u2019s going on around them and law-enforcement seems to be nonexistent. whereas I think this sheer abuse that everyone takes in the newer movies is definitely ludicrous, I understand that it\u2019s meant to be that way. Criticisms aside I have to say that so far this series and especially this newest movie is a master class in showing off the abilities of world-class stuntmen/women and choreography.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the background story is nonexistent and ridiculous, obviously, but is only there to give even the slightest purpose to show off absolutely amazing choreography and action. Which I\u2019m sure everyone knew already, but I just wanted to say my piece.",

The movie starts off with him sparing someone he has every reason to kill, and ends with him killing the one person he shouldn't. It's a really captivating story of someone who desperately wants to be at peace, but the people around him, for whatever reason, can't have that happen.",

For such a high octane, nonstop movie some of the action pieces just seem to drag on for far too long. And regarding the suits, whereas the technology is feasible, and has been done,bullet resistant or not the energy has to go somewhere. Good luck with all the fractured bones and internal bleeding.

He's been shot up like that before, IIRC, and Cane seemed to be fine even after sustaining similar injuries. Did he just prefer to die in that moment? Why?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Maybe the character just didn't have anything to live for, and if that's the case, I just feel like it's the lamest way for such an iconic action hero to go out.!&lt;",

If someone gets shot, stabbed, nunchucked, or whatever, they had it coming. C'est la vie, et c'est la mort.",

It looked pretty, and the choreography was great as always, but it was such a slog. On top of that, they kicked the ridiculousness up a notch, while adding tons of needless plot. It barely felt like a sequel to me, and more like a fever dream of a John wick movie that doesn't exist. It has completely ruined my excitement for the spin-off movies.",

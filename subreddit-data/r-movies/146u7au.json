I guarantee you know an English nerd, not a computer nerd or a gaming nerd but somebody who knows what a split infinitive is and can explain it in detail but works retail to make ends meet. There's somebody out there. Maybe look on Fiverr? I don't know. But if you're in college you should know somebody.\n\nI would proofread work like yours for five bucks if I had the time or inclination. Spend the money.\n\nAnd be specific. You want somebody to read it and then return it to you saying \"oh you've got a split infinitive here, it would be better to say [blank]\". You don't want vague, you want real work.\n\nEdit: you're not looking for a friend, you're looking for a partner. Remember that",

Perhaps its because I was taught that way many moons ago, but it still comes in handy when I have to write something with multiple points.\n\nIn case you are like my kid and never taught in school, here is a quick and dirty explanation...\n\nWrite down every thought you may have.  Look for over-riding themes in your thoughts.  Break down which category or sub-category each point goes under.  Remove anything that doesn't really add much or could be viewed as a spoiler.  Organize again in the order you want the themes presented.  Now you have a game plan to follow and can focus more on your particular writing style without having to constantly go back to add/remove things.\n\nJust my 2 cents.",

I hate hate HATE the idea that a good reason to do something is \"because that's the way we've always done it.\" We must make progress; we must advance. When we find something better, we move on. This is far better than the idea of tradition or simply repeating things out of habit.\n\nAll that said, this idea that modern movie reviews just go through the entire plot, or simply include spoilers at all, is completely wrong and backwards. If I were you, I would go back and read movie reviews from the '60s and '70s. I'm talking about newspaper articles here. Or watch Siskell and Ebert; there's got to be some on YouTube. What they do is they don't describe the plot of the film: they talk *about* the film. What are the themes? What is the movie really about? Is it surprising that it's a love story when it looks like a thriller? DO NOT TELL PEOPLE THERE IS A TWIST ENDING. It's okay to say the film is unexpected, but don't say the *ending* is unexpected. That is the way film reviews ought to be done, and there is a sad lack of film reviews done that way right now.\n\nJust my two cents. Obviously you're trying to appeal to a much younger audience than me. But I think this is right and good, and there are very few people doing things this way, so there's a niche in the market that you could fill and you might find yourself a lot more popular than you would otherwise become.",

I mean, it doesn't feel like it's coming out of my head it's just a report of someone else's work so it's hard to consider it a review. Thanks again, i really mean it.",

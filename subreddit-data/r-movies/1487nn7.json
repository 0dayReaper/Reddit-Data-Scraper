    "postText": "I\u2019ve been watching a bunch of movies lately, most of them I have enjoyed. However, there has been a few movies that I disliked and hated, those movies being the 2011 film \u201cGnomeo and Juliet\u201d and the 2021 film \u201cSpirit Untamed\u201d. I was talking about these films to my mother and she told me that \u201cthey\u2019re not your target demographic\u201d. I don\u2019t really like this statement, because I think that it is just a weak argument to reject all of the criticisms of the movie. What do you think though? I think that it\u2019s just a bunch of hogwash.",

Nitpicking media that's not meant to have a really complex narrative isn't appropriate for children's media, for example. Nobody cares about the verisimilitude of social services in Hawaii when they watch Lilo and Stitch. They want to enjoy the little girl and blue alien having adventures.",

It\u2019s one thing to point out valid criticisms of parts of the actual movie (plot, character development, etc.). It\u2019s entirely another just to call it a dumb movie because you didn\u2019t get it, and can\u2019t fathom why someone else (particularly the target audience) would love it. \n\nWe see it in superhero movies a lot. We see it especially in movies literally targeting people of color and women and the LGBTQIA+ community. \n\nSo, I suggest being thoughtful and considerate of those to whom the filmmakers are trying to reach first and foremost. Everyone outside their target demographic is welcome, but often just a bonus.",

Any releases aiming for more than 500~1000 screens hope for something of a 4-quad audience. That's when you get out-group members criticizing an in-group subject. Like Billy Eichner blaming straight audiences whom he expected to watch Bros, without asking how he tried to be \"inclusive\" of the straight gaze (which Ang Lee did, albeit for the outcome of a tragic story.) Medea movies don't get flak as they are never marketed to more than a core audience.",

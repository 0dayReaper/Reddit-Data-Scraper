We always heard about him but didn't see him much until he had to prep for his reprisal in the reboots about five years ago. My little brother as well as my girlfriend at the time were physical therapy technicians and actually got to work with him during his PT! \n\nSmall world, but they said he was super sweet and I'm sure he'll be sorely missed. It's amazing a man that large could live so long. RIP Chewie.",

So I spotted some obscure exit doors that would afford me a shortcut. \n\nWhen I opened the doors I found myself in a small loading area. Mr. Mayhew was sitting there alone in a wheelchair having a smoke. \n\n\u201cHow ya doing?\u2019\u201d I said. \u201cGreat!\u201d he replied, with the biggest grin on his face. \n\nWe nodded at each other. I went back inside and that was that. \n\nRIP, PM.",

I'm not meaning to take away from the story but reading stories like this and seeing their ages gives me this pit in my stomach sometimes. As for Peter thank you for everything you've done, you were an inspiration.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to say thank you for your responses everyone! It does seem like it would have been related to his health, as for my dad I have hope he still has a long way to go before his time is done. Have a great day everyone!",

Had no money for anything, but it was my first con so I was still giddy with everything going on. I see Peter Mayhew at his booth and Billy Dee Williams at his own not too far. I nerd out completely and I couldn't believe they were right there. \n\nBilly was so busy with everyone trying to line up to talk to him, Peter's line had died down a bit. I get in line, feeling bad that I can't pay him for any photograph or signature or anything. Its my turn to talk to him, and I go up to him and tell him that I've loved Chewbacca since I was a kid, and that I wanna tell him that I'm such a fan of his work. Dude is so warm and friendly, and tells me that he's glad the role has provided so much happiness to so many people. We even talk for a minute about TFA which was coming out soon, I'll never forget how he tells me, \"Oh I really think you'll be pleased, the story is quite...interesting.\" Which we all know now what he was talking about. Meanwhile I can't believe that freaking Chewbacca just teased the new movie for me. I didnt wanna hold up the line, so I just thanked him so much for his time and left really happy that I got to talked to him. RIP Peter, I'll be telling every one about this.",

I love sharing it, and letting people know how great a guy he was. \n\nOne of my favorite memories is sneaking out the back of the Orange County Convention Center in Mandalorian armor to smoke with a buddy. I was holding the door for my friend when, to my bewilderment, Peter Mayhew and his wife come through. So there the four of us are, just kind of hanging out smoking, Peter Mayhew complementing us on our kits. I was just kinda dumbfounded. After a bit, security comes out and starts telling me and my buddy we have to go inside. Peter goes \u201cno no, this here\u2019s my Mandalorian guard!\u201d Security was having none of it though. He looks at us and laughs, \u201csorry boys, I tried, have a good time\u201d. I think I thanked him, I may have just mumbled incoherently. I got to meet him again a couple years later, and he was always so kind and thoughtful. He was my favorite, and losing him sucks really bad. But I\u2019m glad he can rest now, he deserves it. May the Force be with you, Mr. Mayhew, Always.",

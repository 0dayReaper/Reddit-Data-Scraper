    "postText": "I have an image in my mind of a shot from a film I\u2019ve never seen. It\u2019s in black and white and shot from above. The man is lying in a jail cell or some kind or caged room. The floor is made of wooden planks. It\u2019s a beautiful shot, and I would love to watch the full movie. If anyone has any idea what movie this is from that would be awesome",

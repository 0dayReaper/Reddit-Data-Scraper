    "postText": "A few years ago when \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d was released on 4K Blu-Ray, I bought it after my work shift ended and I returned home and loaded the disc into my player to sample the quality. \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow\u201d is sung by Judy Garland in the first five minutes of the film, and when it was over I noticed tears streaming down my face. I hadn\u2019t seen the film in some time, and I totally forgot how beautiful Garland\u2019s voice is. \n\nA similar thing happened again a couple of months ago when I finally watched \u201cTwin Peaks: The Return.\u201d At the end of \u201cPart 10\u201d, Rebekah Del Rio gives a vocal performance as entrancing and emotionally powerful as the one she gave in \u201cMulholland Drive\u201d 16 years prior. Incredible. \n\nHas a musical sequence in a film ever moved you to tears?",

If you come to them outright and ask them to play the role then you're in the position of potentially being rejected. But if you tease them into thinking how they could best fill the role they immediately have a vested interest in the character and are the ones asking *you*. And if they genuinely don't want the role they can suggest someone, maybe help one of their friends, and you can both walk away happy.",

Works well.\n\n&gt; Early in the development of Dick Tracy, Beatty decided to make the film using a palette limited to just seven colors, primarily red, green, blue and yellow\u2014to evoke the film's comic strip origins; furthermore each of the colors was to be exactly the same shade. Beatty's design team included production designer Richard Sylbert, set decorator Rick Simpson, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (whom Beatty had worked with on his previous film, Ishtar, as producer and lead actor), visual effects supervisors Michael Lloyd and Harrison Ellenshaw, prosthetic makeup designers John Caglione, Jr. and Doug Drexler, and costume designer Milena Canonero. Their main intention was to stay close to Chester Gould's original drawings from the 1930s. Other influences came from the Art Deco movement and German Expressionism\n\nIt won Best Art Direction that year (1990) and was well deserved. Looks great.",

Yes, it's largely driven by concept art done before hand, but not all of it...and directors are usually not very hands on at all when it comes to VFX. Even worse is that any full CG shots probably won't have the input of the film's DP...the cameras, lighting, and composition is being set by folks in the layout/lighting department of our VFX studio, and a lot of VFX supervisors (not me cause I study and worship the work that directors of photography do) will simply never change the shot once the layout/lighting is \"approved\" which literally just means that someone agrees with the general direction of the shot. I've seen some of the ugliest and most sterile camera moves go into final films because someone in layout set two keyframes, submitted the shot to dailies, and no one in the entire studio felt they had the sway to go \"hey this camera needs to be upgraded\"",

The names and varying characters make this a fun arcade version of the real world.\n\nDick Tracy won Best Art Direction and Best Makeup and well deserved. The creators really did do their research on this and Epps read every comic from 1930 to 1957. That is how you do it.\n\nI remember Dick Tracy summer when it was released, the merchandise was everywhere and modeled on Batman the year before which was also intense but awesome as a kid. The movie was rad then and holds up now as a great comic book flick that shows real world exaggerated but important aspects of organized crime and fighting that.\n\nThe movie has a common theme of crime comics in that a gang takes over another gang and of course they wanna be a mini monarch. Not in Dick's world.\n\nDick Tracy is over 30 years old now but here's some info on the challenging production, Beatty even had to pay for some of it himself. Harrison Ford was considered for Dick Tracy as well.\n\n[Bullets Over Burbank: Celebrating 30 Years of Disney's 'Dick Tracy'](https://collider.com/dick-tracy-anniversary-warren-beatty-madonna/)\n\n[Dick Tracy (1990 film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Tracy_\\(1990_film\\)#Development)",

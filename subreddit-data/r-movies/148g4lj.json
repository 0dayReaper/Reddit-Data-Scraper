Disney has never outright confirmed it but the creators said it had everything to do with the fact there was a queer love story with two men saying I love you. The film was almost done and would've been Disney's first actual gay characters on screen. But they chickened out all the while selling Pride merch with straight Disney characters on it. Netflix saved this film. I'm praying it's excellent. I'm praying people love it. I'm praying it becomes a cultural phenomenon. I'm hoping it becomes a beloved franchise because I'd like Disney to be kicking themselves for not having produced this. And if this actually is a hit and gets an Oscar nomination over anything Disney produced this year, I'd laugh so hard.",

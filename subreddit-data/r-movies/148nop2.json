    "postText": "Scarlett Johansson in North (1994), she was just 9 years old when she did this film, North for nearly 30 years has been reviled as one of the worst movies ever made. even Siskel and Ebert hated this film and Roger Ebert gave North thumbs down with his infamous quote \"I hated this movie, Hated Hated Hated Hated Hated this Movie Hated It!\" i'm Glad Scarlett Johansson got better at acting after North cause North is not the great start for her as an actress. \n\nSam Rockwell in Clownhouse (1988) - a very disturbing controversial horror film written and directed by Victor Salva. yeah everyone knows about him I'm not even going to bother to talk about Salva. I'm glad Sam Rockwell got better at acting after Clownhouse because Clownhouse is not a great start for him as an actor. Sam Rockwell won best supporting actor for his performance in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri and he was awesome in that movie. \n\nChris Evans in Not Another Teen Movie (2001) - I couldn't get into this movie. Painfully unfunny and one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I'm shocked that this was Chris Evans' first movie. I'm so glad he got better at acting after this film.",

I rewatched it like a year ago and I think most of the jokes are still pretty funny. \n\nMaybe it's just because of my age though, when those types of movies (teen movies) were getting churned out like crazy.",

    "postText": "There are a lot of franchise and movie you just go to see the action, the spectacular: Transformer, Godzilla, fast and furius,  to name a few.\n\nBut of course you can't do full CGI for a full movie. That would be expensive. That why movie with non human like Transformer have quite small Transfromer in it in total screentime, Godzilla have like 15 minutes of Godzilla in most case. And lot of these movie is criticized for it writing anyways, But for some reason these movie is almost 3 hours\n\nPersonally i find it is a chore to get through them to get to the CGI, big explosion part.And i get quite tired and my eye a bit hurt after the movie end.\n\nAnd then i think about the 4d ride thing where, and i was like: wait, why can't i see movie like that (but not fixed in just 1 camera pov, of course), you just go to see the action, some context scene to filled in-between and get the hell out ? standard 90 minutes probally work, Personally i fine with a 45 minutes movie, probally enough to inclue a story of how they kicking each other ass for context.",

I did say when I rewatched the movie in full, I realized the movie was terrible.\n\nOn the flight, I knew Transformers 5 was a bad movie. I knew the reviews were especially savage. But I was on a plane and I had limited entertainment, so I decided to just watch the bits that Michael Bay does well, which is spectacle. His other instincts - juvenile, misogynistic and/or racist humour, an inability to keep a camera static, never attempting to build empathy or depth with characters, etc - generally make his movies worse.\n\nSo when you watch the bits that he does well and skip the bits that he executes poorly, you end up with a better viewing experience overall than watching the whole movie.",

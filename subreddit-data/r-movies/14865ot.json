    "postText": "I'm sure tons of people here are familiar with the godsend that is Drew's script-o-rama. I'm sure tons of people have noticed that the site runs from '95 to 2022, with the last update happening last January. Maybe I'm wrong and nobody notices or cares, but I'm truly surprised by the lack of interest across the internet (and I guess, particularly Reddit) in what's happened to the site and Drew. No info on the person themself; no video essay YouTubers tackling the subject/saga; no standalone threads questioning what's happened or where drew is at, save for a post or two from the past couple years where people wonder why the site was (briefly) down. \n\nAnybody ever have these same questions? Anybody ever want to know more about drew or if they're OK? What the fate of the site is/whose hands it's in now? Would love to see if there's any broader interest in this or if anybody has any info or ever knew/spoke to drew personally.  Kind of an emotional inquiry but I'm deeply invested just because I've dug so deep and appreciated the work so much. \n\nI've never posted in this sub so apologies if it's a little off-topic, but the subs specific to screenwriting are so small, I wanted to cast a wider net. Hope it's not too far off from your regularly scheduled programming.",

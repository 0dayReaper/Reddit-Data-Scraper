    "postText": "It's actually kind of shocking.\n\n1. CEO is kind of a despot and implements sweeping changes on the platform built entirely around monetizing the platform\n2. The platform is essentially a virtual town square that brings people of disparate interests together, where they can talk about what excites them\n3. The company cares only about pleasing its shareholders (pre-IPO valuation), but the communities feel it's not right to make tyrannical pricing on access to the town square\n4. The community revolts against the despot by taking time off of the platform\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt feels like it's not about API pricing but instead the love of free expression around shared interests. This is literally Ready Player One, right? Were there any good arguments for the CEO in that movie?",

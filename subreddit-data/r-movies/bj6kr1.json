The toys are all awesome, it has some fun action, likeable characters... And just the whole concept of fighting toys is cool!\\*\n\nThe only thing I disliked as a kid was that barbie army. That was kinda creepy.\n\n\\* That reminds me, does anyone remember that movie \"Toys\" with Robin Williams? I don't really remember the first half, but always thought the last part was really cool, having this army of toys.",

I remember my parents actively taking it before the barbie thing appeared on scren and putting it back as soon as the scene finished. They still laugh about that, idk what was it, but I used to be terrified of \"mildly\" creepy stuff like that. It is creepy, but not as creepy as childs play or alien which were also among mi favorites when I was a kid ( yeah my dad loved movies that a 7 year old shouldnt really watch but he wanted to share)\n\nSomething that caused the same reaction on me was voldermots face in the back of Quirells head... damn I used to hide behind furniture to avoid seeing that wtf",

Part of it is MGM keeping the property, part of it is them capitalizing on Universal doing so well.",

Theaters are pretty terrible business models, even when offering a wide diversity of options from all the studios most theaters are only barely profitable from ticket sales alone. Buying a theater and then significantly cutting it's offerings would definitely push those numbers into the red. Disney benefits from audiences having easy access to theaters, and theaters can only stay open if they have other movies to show inbetween Disney releases, so even if Disney bought a theater they would need to either screen movies from competing studios, or increase their own output to 52 movies a year.",

What you are thinking of are the megaplex theaters AMC, Regal, etc built with multiple screens.  And you would be correct in assuming it's not great for Disney.  But having a couple showcase theaters for your premier's is certainly worthwhile to Disney, if not from direct sales but from additional advertisement and having red carpet events.\n\nEdit: Actually kind of amusingly the El Capitan was originally a Paramount theater and was forced out of their hands by the United States vs Paramount.  Which brings it to why Disney now owns it, and uses sit for all their premiers...   heh",

Last time I was there they announced they aren't playing Disney movies anymore because of the ridiculous terms Disney imposes, like showing it every day 4 weeks minimum.",

The plus side then was that the theater/studio monoliths were in cutthroat competition for bums in seats, so they threw money at the creatives and said go nuts. The film boom of 1939 was the result. We're seeing a repeat of that now. (And it won't last.)",

Also giant size-of-your-head margaritas, which may have contributed to the difficulty.",

Handing too much power to one company when it comes to production, distribution and exhibition usually ends with the customer losing out in the long run. Hollywood banned it for various reasons at one point in its history.\n\nAnother worry is that this will snowball into theatrical windows being a lot shorter and therefore effecting the bottom line of a lot of cinemas, especially independents. We are already seeing companies like Netflix and Amazon go against long held agreements in the industry such as disclosing box office records. Matt Mueller has written a really interesting think piece about it in this months Screen Daily.\n\nI\u2019m not sure where I fall in the argument because I do believe that the industry needs to adapt and change but Netflix definitely isn\u2019t playing fair at the same time. Just remember that is is more complicated than it seems and could end up negatively effecting the consumer too.",

Hollywood basically got actors and directors as indentured servants, and there was no creative changes.\n\nThe Paramount Agreement, which the Justice Department petitioned to cancel last week, was an agreement between the federal government and Hollywood, where the government wouldn't forcibly break up or dissolve the studios as long as they jettisoned and sold off the distribution and Cinema portions of their business while also promising to no longer use the tactic of block booking.\n\nPersonally, I think Disney+ and Hulu goes against the spirit of the agreement. Their production style is different than Netflix, which tests itself more like a network. As soon as they started breaking into the digital space, we started to get these stupid streaming wars that just bleed customers dry again.",

The 7-1 decision stopped short of forever making it illegal for studios to own cinemas. \"We see no reason to place a ban on this type of ownership,\" wrote Justice William Douglas.",

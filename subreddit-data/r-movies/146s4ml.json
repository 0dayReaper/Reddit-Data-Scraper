These are films that get better with every re-watch, and their genius has absolutely nothing to do with whatever plot element you know about them.",

They are well worth a watch, even today.  \n  \nA better example would be something like Star Trek Into Darkness, where to me at least, now that I know the outcome, I don\u2019t much care for most of the movie. it\u2019s all built on these mystery and \u201cgotchas\u201d. There\u2019s better examples of this but that\u2019s one that comes to mind.  \n  \nMost old movies aren\u2019t like that; it\u2019s incredible dialogue, scale, camera and set work, and tells a real and engaging story start to finish.  \n  \nThink of Citizen Kane more like Titanic; yes you know the ship sinks, but it\u2019s still an extravagant story and spectacle to see.\n  \nTo add my hat to the whole topic, I\u2019ve never any of the Harry Potter movies and I know SO MANY plot details. I missed the boat by not being allowed to watch or read it when I was young. I actually still want to get around to watching them, but it\u2019s just hard to get into the headspace and patience for it.",

It's also the film that he and our son (who's currently 19) have been watching at least once a year since our son was maybe 13? My son will even pull it out on his own sometimes, if he can't figure out what else to watch. He knows it's always a good go-to.\n\nI think with 12 Angry Men, and many other movies, the point isn't what the end/twist is, it's how they get there.",

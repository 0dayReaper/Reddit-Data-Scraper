    "postText": "Personally I thought it was a fantastic film. Its grittiness is perfect to represent a standard london 'ill manor'.\n\nIt was during one of the worst points in londons modern history and represented it really well. It had a bit of a slow start but I think this was necessary to set the stage for all of the stories linking together.\n\nSo why the hate, a lot of people seem to think its an awful movie?",

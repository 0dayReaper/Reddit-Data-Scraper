The articles I've personally read only so far say things like \"a source tells us,\" which isn't a concrete citation. Neither is Variety itself,  who will often say things like \"This actor is cast\" when they're still in negotiations.\n\nSince this is a very hot-button issue right now, and since Tarantino has yet to say anything publicly about it (declined to comment on this article,  for example), if anyone has a better source - please post here.",

She objected to the onscreen depiction of her late father as an arrogant and boastful man who struggles to defeat Pitt\u2019s characters in a fight. \n\nChinese censors coming to the rescue of an American's hurt feelings? Definitely not what I expected.",

I think it's safe to say he strongly identified with both Hong Kong and the US. Also important to remember is that he would have been there during British rule.",

But no matter how you slice it, he was like 140 lbs.\n\nMany people in fighting (even at the time) question Lee's durability and his ability to win fights 'within sporting rules' (no nut shots, eye gouges, etc). Lee did a lot of demonstrations, but there are few instances of him getting hit hard and recovering.\n\nSport fighters and Mohammed Ali got evidence of getting hit, and recovering. Lee *mostly* is known for demonstrations, and gets crowned the 'best fighter in the world', which has bothered many sport fighters.\n\nThat said, if you mix in weapons.. I might say Lee was the best street-fighter of the time, and would feel confident on that. Speed matters more with weapons - if you put him in the Octagon, with MMA rules, I doubt it'd go as good as you suspect, even at his weight class.",

He was a nice fellow. The stunt coordinator hired me, and I worked on quite a few episodes. During that time, I was able to get to know Bruce a little bit, and we even worked out together. He was the best martial artist of his time.\n\n\nBruce and I had a bond with the martial arts, and we would get together frequently. We worked out about 10 to 12 times at his place in Los Angeles\u2019 Chinatown and at my place.\n\n\nWhen I went to his place, he showed me what he did, and I showed him what I did. Although he seemed to love the finishing holds of grappling, it just wasn\u2019t commercially attractive at the time. Actually, it was because of my grappling and tumbling background that I was hired to do the television show \u2014 because I could take falls for Bruce.\n\n\nBruce Lee was an entertaining fellow who was very knowledgeable and very good at what he did. People may wonder just how good a martial artist he was. Well, as I said earlier, he was the best of his time. Also, many of his former students are doing very well today. That\u2019s a sign that he was a good martial artist and that he was able to make his students into good martial artists.\n\n\nBruce developed and performed his own style of kung fu, and a lot of the traditional guys didn\u2019t like it because it broke from Chinese tradition. I know what that is like because I had the same trouble when I tried to improve different martial arts by changing things for the better. I believe that anytime you can have an open mind and learn something new, then add it to your repertoire, it\u2019s a good thing. It will only make you and your students more knowledgeable.\u201d",

I understand QT is all about alt-history (but he did go out of his way to mirror historically accurate events of the time like the restaurants people went to so who knows). I still don't like the way they portrayed a legendary man who, by all accounts, was an incredible guy.",

Cliff holding his own then validates how he kicks the shit out of the Manson family.  Cliff has to remain sympathetic to the viewer.  In the flashback where he is on the boat with his wife, you can hear her bitching at him.  Obviously murder is evil no matter what, but it is downplayed by the audience remaining sympathetic to Cliff... IE: He had no choice.",

We expect some level of disbelief when it comes to the plot since it is a Tarantino movie, but that is all subverted by the setting (less lawful 1960s), a protagonist who we already know is tough as hell, another protagonist who is at a cross roads in his life and has used a bizarre weapon previously.  \n\nThe beauty of the film is at the end; it serves justice to evil, sets Dalton back on a path to a second chapter in his acting career, and restrengthens the friendship between Dalton and Booth.  Presumably Dalton meets Polanski, gets cast in a film, he can afford to keep Cliff around and offer him jobs, the Manson family is destroyed, and Sharon and her friends live.",

Bruce Lee was simply playing the role of the \"old real-life cowboy beaten by the new young blood\".

Seeing some movies is more like visiting an art museum, seeing other movies is more like visiting an amusement park. I've got nothing against amusement parks and I've got nothing against the movies that are reminiscent of amusement parks. But it's a fundamentally different experience than seeing a Fellini film.",

Don't get me wrong, I think Tarantino is a self-centered narcissistic prick, but he's in the right here. Kill Bill is damn good cinema, and he leaves it up to the parents to decide if their kids are mature enough to see it. \n\nHe isn't ashamed of the violence and doesn't try to hide the nature of the film or falsely advertise to kids, and he focuses on the inspirational aspect of the character and how it breaks gender norms in cinema by being a violent hero that's a woman, living and dying by a code of honor, etc. I think his point would have been much better explained of the interviewer would have stopped being a cunt for a minute and just let him fucking talk.",

Gene put Bruce in a headlock, then picked him up and carried him around the set, and Bruce was unable to do anything about it since he knew no grappling. After Gene let him go, Bruce's immediate reaction was something like \"man, you need to teach me that,\" he wasn't angry or even annoyed at all, he just saw it as an opportunity to learn new fighting techniques. And then they went on to train together for over a year; Bruce taught Gene some striking and Gene taught Bruce some grappling, which he added to his jeet kune do style and used in later movies. They became friends over that time training. This is massively different from the arrogant prick they portrayed in the movie for no apparent reason. The problem people had wasn't that he got beat up, but that they decided to shit all over his personality for laughs. \n\nThat being said, yeah it's just a movie and his daughter should have just let it go. \n\nSource: https://www.scmp.com/sport/martial-arts/kung-fu/article/3022773/could-gene-lebell-beat-bruce-lee-meet-real-life-cliff",

It has been alleged that at some point LeBell heard about the claim and gave Seagal the opportunity to prove it. **LeBell is said to have placed his arms around Seagal's neck, and once Seagal said \"go\", proceeded to choke him unconscious, with Seagal losing control of his bowels.**[**\\[16\\]**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_LeBell#cite_note-sing-16)\n\nLeBell was requested to confirm the story publicly in an interview with [Ariel Helwani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Helwani) in 2012, but he avoided answering the question, albeit implying that the incident was true.[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_LeBell#cite_note-sing-16) He was quoted as \"When we had a little altercation or difference of opinion, there were thirty stuntmen and cameramen that were watching. Sometimes Steven has a tendency to cheese off the wrong people, and you can get hurt doing that.\"[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_LeBell#cite_note-17) After being asked whether he was not going to directly confirm it, LeBell said \"Well, if thirty people are watching, let them talk about it.\"[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_LeBell#cite_note-sing-16)\n\nOn the other hand, when Seagal was asked about the incident, he directly denied the allegations, calling LeBell a \"sick, pathological scumbag liar,\" and offered the name of a witness who could prove Lebell had fabricated this rumor.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_LeBell#cite_note-18) The claim garnered a heated response from LeBell's trainee [Ronda Rousey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronda_Rousey), who assured Seagal was the one lying and declared \"If \\[Seagal\\] says anything bad about Gene to my face, I'd have to make him crap his pants a second time.\"[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_LeBell#cite_note-19)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene\\_LeBell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_LeBell)",

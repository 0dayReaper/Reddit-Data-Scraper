They sound like OK jokes of a typical American talk show host to me, but this interpretation doesn't quite fit the desperate loser character of Rupert Pupkin.\n\nI really like the movie, though. Feels so modern for its time.",

We're encouraged to believe throughout the film that he's awful (thanks to his uncomfortable personality, the lengths he goes to, how much he's rejected, etc.) but he's actually not. He's no genius, he's not groundbreaking, but he's perfectly suitable for the show he's on. \n\nThis makes his actions even more chilling IMO because he could have got there without doing all those terrible things if he'd had patience. I've seen some people describe his routine as awful though, so I might be alone in this!",

            "comment": "Uh I wouldn't call them safe jokes. They are simple jokes from our modern perspective but for the time depicted they would have been fairly edgy jokes, somewhere just a bit more desperate than say a Rodney Dangerfield. \n\nI think that we are meant to feel an overwhelming sense of Pupkins desperation. Even though the jokes are funny, the pathos of Pupkin, the raw pain behind every word makes it look slightly uncomfortable. You want him to kill with the audience when he finally gets up there but you still feel a bit of sadness. I did anyway. \n\nI think the viewer brings to it thier own interpretation. Scorsese ways specialized in depicting desperate men, sort of on the edge. If the viewer has ever been in that place then I think there is something they might feel that is different than another person.\n\nWas he a desperate fame chaser? A comedy hack? A dangerous looser? And most importantly, perhaps, were the jokes funny?\n\nFor me the jokes were funny but the character of Pupkin made them land sort of meh. Like a lot of very funny people, they have lives filled with pain and sadness. Rupert Pupkin could do the act, he could do the set in front of the audience, he could get the laughs but he just couldn't play the system and get there the hard way from the bottom. \n\nIt's asking us what is it really that makes someone famous. Is it always talent? Is it usually talent and some luck? Is it being able to conform to the required pathways of show businesses plus the other stuff usually? Are there severly under talented hacks that get there anyway? I think there are. More so now than ever. But even back then it was pretty obvious that some very famous people were basically manufactured to be there from an early age, and that in the periphery of it all are some seriously damaged people who never got a shot. \n\nThat's why it's so fascinating to see DeNiro play the successful comedy/talk host in Joker. As if to drive the exact same point home again. A lot of life seems arbitrary and there is so much wasted potential out there. \n\nWhat exactly does Scorsese want us to feel when Rupert Pupkin is about the act? I don't think we are supposed to say \"wow what a comedy genius\" because the jokes are really not that great. You can write a joke about a man drowning, watching a man drown isn't the same thing.",

Rupert is killing on the show (though it's debatable the whole thing ever even happened) because he really believes he's great and there is, to him, no way he could ever bomb. \n\nWhether or not he is actually doing well does not matter - he would find a way to spin it positively to make himself believe he did.",

            "comment": "I see it as revealing a lot about Pupkin's past, being able to empathize and sympathize with his horrible childhood, something he makes light of for some easy laughs on late night. I think it's not meant to come off as good or bad, just standard late night stand up. I feel making the on air jokes anything else would've been too on the nose. Making them incredible would start to justify Pupkin's behavior the entire movie and making them horrible would feel snobby and on the nose commentary about how he is just not good enough. It is far more terrifying to see how unhinged and insane this guy is all to... deliver a perfectly fine set for late night audience. It's a commentary both on how pathetic the system is in evaluating talent as well as almost a scary reminder (which is even more timely now) about how the individual barely matters when it comes to the output. I am sure plenty of people working in Hollywood nowadays did not have the same path to get to the position they did... and yet all the movies, editing, cinematography, writing, etc. often feels the same across them.\n\nSo you learn about Pupkins past and sort of infer why he became the way he did, but you also more terrifyingly see how he really isn't any different from any of these \"talented\" people he's routinely told he can't be by big names. Ultimately, it's all homogenous and in today's age of ChatGPT and AI, it's an even more scary reminder of that.",

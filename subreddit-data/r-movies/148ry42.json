    "postText": "I've read the plot somewhere before, but I don't remember the name of the film. She's been dead for years, and the brother she's never met is having an LSD overdose. So, from the afterlife, she tries to save him. The plot even takes place in the 90s/00s.\n\nNever seen the movie, so I've got nothing more than that. I'm trying to make a spiritual trilogy of RUN LOLA RUN, MILLENNIUM MAMBO, and this film.\n\nLet me know.",

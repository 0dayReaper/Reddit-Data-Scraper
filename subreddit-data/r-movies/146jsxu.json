    "postText": " Question, What do you think of On The Waterfront?\n\nOn The Waterfront is a 1954 film directed by Elia Kazan and focuses on union violence and corruption amongst longshoremen while detailing widespread corruption, extortion, and racketeering on the waterfronts of Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nIn My Opinion, this is one of the greatest films ever made. I honestly think this is Peak Young Marlon Brando. Brando gives the performance of a lifetime as Terry Molloy, a man who is conflicted on whether he should testified against the corruption within or not. The Supporting Performances are also excellent. Karl Malden as Father Perry, The Preist who urges the people to confess their sins and advocating for peaceful resistance. Lee J. Cobb as Johnny Friendly, a Man who wants to remain power at all costs and will threaten anyone who dare to threaten his power. Eve Marie Saint as Edie Doyle, The Sister Of The Murdered Brother who wants justice and the key to Terry's redemption and Rod Steiger as Charlie \"The Gent\" Molloy (My Favorite Performance from this Movie), a very understated performance, and a real tragic figure, he is loyal to Johnny Friendly, but also has a soft spot for his brother, and in the end, he decided to give his brother a chance. In my Opinion, other than the Godfather, the is probably one of the greatest casts ever assemble.\n\nAlso Elia Kazan does a fantastic job Directing On The Waterfront. One of the greatest's scenes from this Movie I love was the cab drive scene with Terry and Charley. Charley has received a rude reckoning from Johnny Friendly and is told to talk some sense into Terry. In the Cab, Charley pulls a gun on Terry. Terry looks hurt and Charley feels shame. Then they both resmients Terry's boxing days and how Terry stated that Charley took his boxing away over a bet. And thus, Charley, in his last act, decided to give Terry a chance and escape Johnny Friendly, gives him his car, and tells him to leave to cab.\n\nReally You Can't Write this Stuff Anymore.\n\nI also Loved Leonard Bernstein's score and how subtle it is.\n\nAll In All, What Do You Think Of On The Waterfront?",

Great music, acting, directing, really just everything. \n\nAs the film that introduced America to Method acting; Brando, Cobb, and Steiger were all taught the Method, Elia Kazan was one of the founders of the Group Theater, I think anyone wanting to be an actor must watch this film.\n\nAs for the message, it is a bit controversial. Kazan was targeted by HUAC, but he did name names. Part of it was a disillusionment with left wing politics, but a lot of it was personal grievances with people he worked with in the past. Kazan said he did not think the people he named would have their careers hurt and that the committee already knew who they were, but there are conflicting accounts. \n\nIf we put the people that Kazan threw under the bus as stand ins for the mobsters and Kazan as Malloy, things get a little dicey and sanctimonious. Still, it is an excellent film.",

            "comment": "Excellent film and a wonderful allegory for Kazan\u2019s experience with fellow communists in Hollywood at the time. \nThe way some within the communist movement had a tendency to infiltrate unions to bully people on every level of a studio. The first I can think off the top of my head, if I\u2019m remembering correctly is how a guy named Herbert Sorell infiltrated the Disney writers union and bullied Walt Disney within his own company, Walt being staunchly anti-communist. If you ever wondered where the idea that Walt Disney was an anti-semite came from, thank Herbert Sorell and the communists of 50s Hollywood trying to slander him for going against their rhetoric.",

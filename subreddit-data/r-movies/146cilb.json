It is an understated and brilliant role in the hands of Hardy, who really occupies the quiet dignity of a man taking the path of least resistance.  The movie works because of his performance, but Gandolfini and Rapace lend their considerable talents to the film as well.",

Probably his most underrated too. \n\nTom Hardy is one of my favorite actors, but I can admit he clearly is more interested in hamming it up with Peaky Blinders, Legend, The Revenant, and Venom all being examples. Even Locke, he decided to do a Welsh accent for no real reason. \n\nAll great performances (to varying degrees), but TTSS is one of the few performances that doesn't have any gimmicks from him. Just playing a normal guy, who is a spy way in over his head. \n\nHe is PHENOMENAL in it. I urge people to check that film out\n\nPersonal favorites, man, I still love Bane. He rocks in Inception. A beast in Warrior. The Drop\n\nThe list goes on. Can't wait for The Bikeriders this year",

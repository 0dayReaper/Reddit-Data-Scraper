Wallander is fun because it lets him do the whole range. He does a lot of normal subdued Brannagh stuff but then it\u2019s punctuated with the action, climaxes etc",

The series in general are really well produced almost invented the English-language Scandi-noir genre.\n\nAll his recent big roles have been villains or caricatures, neither of which I would say are his strongsuit. The exception would be Dunkirk, which I'd put in the same category of character as his Kurt Wallander.",

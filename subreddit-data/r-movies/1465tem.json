    "postText": "I thought it was actually quite good, it was better then some of the movies that Spielberg had come out recently.  I remember being so built up for Ready Player One, then being dissapointed on it being actually kind of boring.  That movie just did not engage me like I thought it would.  West Side Story, I never ended up watching, despite all of the hip.  I was afraid the Fablemans would end up being the same way, despite the fact that I was really looking forward to it for months on end.  In the end, this movie actually ended up being what I thought it would be, althought in the middle part, when Sam Fableman stops filming for a time, kind of dragged slightly, when it focused on his parents, althought the Anti Semantic bully scenes were actually quite dramatic.  In the end, when Fableman picks up his camera again, it really takes off again.  What were your thoughts upon seeing this movie?",

Even when he's trying to be serious, I still see Dale from Pineapple Express. Other than that, I got lost in the brilliance of it. I'm a huge fan of coming of age stories and The Fabelmans hits the nail on the head.",

We see the Cinerama sign on a theater in the background in one scene but it never shows him going there to a movie.  Really disappointing.\n\nThis film should have been more like Hope And Glory (1987) where John Boorman depicted his life as a youngster in England during the blitz.  He balanced family drama with the scary/excitement of the bombings and the after math.",

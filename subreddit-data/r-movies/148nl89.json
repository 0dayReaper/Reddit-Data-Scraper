Before McCarthy I thought the only way to really convey an extreme was through impeccably imaginative and excessively detailed description. \n\nIt took his skill to deliver it, but to this day \"it was very cold\" is still the most impactful description of dangerously frigid weather in a bleak situation I've read. \n\nHe had a singular talent for deceptively blunt prose sprinkled intermittently with shots of sophistication that cut to the raw emotion of a story more effectively than any other author I've read.",

Fourteen years later, I still get a pit in my stomach just thinking about it. I don't even remember all the details, just this overbearing sense of dread (?), maybe. Couldn't bring myself to even watch the movie.\n\nRent free is right.

Didn't they.\n\n&gt; The &gt;!tinker!&lt; might of named him. \n\n&gt; It wasn't his to name. Besides names dies with the namers.

There are certain books that I've read and have forgotten about quite quickly after finishing it, but even after 12 years, I think about this book frequently and like everyone completely transfixed by Judge Holden (probably the greatest contemporary literary character of all time).\n\nEven though he's 89, this one stings.",

It just seems to be about a guy who wanders from one violent situation to the next.\n\nThat's pretty much it to be honest. How far did you get? Once he joins the gang of scalp hunters it starts to feel like there's a bit more of a narrative through line but it's still very much a series of violence and atrocities that can feel very meaningless if you're not won over by the prose. It definitely starts to escalate towards a conclusion in the back half though. \n\nI love it and it really is wonderfully written but if you're the kind of person who prefers a more conventional narrative structure then it probably isn't going to land with you. Like I said though, if you haven't managed on previous attempts I would definitely recommend at least powering through about the first 6-7 chapters in order to get to the point where he joins the gang.",

It's about fear, genocide, destruction, the devil himself.\n\nAlso, try reading it with Wikipedia open. If full dates and names are given, they're most likely real events and people. It helps",

Just pure galena. Tons of it. On this ground alone between the Arkansas River and the Concho there were eight million carcasses for that's how many hides reached the railhead. Two years ago we pulled out from Griffin for a last hunt. We ransacked the country. Six weeks. Finally found a herd of eight animals and we killed them and come in. They're gone. Ever one of them that God ever made is gone as if they'd never been at all.\n\n&gt; The ragged sparks blew down the wind. The prairie about them lay silent. Beyond the fire it was cold and the night was clear and the stars were falling. The old hunter pulled his blanket about him. I wonder if there's other worlds like this, he said. Or if this is the only one.\n\nEvery time I read that book I end up reading those paragraphs over and over and being amazed at the sheer vividness of the scene, it's both awe inspiring, horrifying and poignant in equal measure.",

Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.",

I dont remember the first one all that well but it was about meetin him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. But the second one it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin through the mountains of a night. Goin through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on goin. Never said nothin. He just rode on past and he had this blanket wrapped around him and he had his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. About the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was goin on ahead and that he was fixin to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up.\"",

Set on the south-western ranches in the years before the Second World War, Cormac McCarthy's The Crossing follows the fortunes of sixteen-year-old Billy Parham and his younger brother Boyd. Fascinated by an elusive wolf that has been marauding his family's property, Billy captures the animal - but rather than kill it, sets out impulsively for the mountains of Mexico to return it to where it came from. When Billy comes back to his own home he finds himself and his world irrevocably changed.!&lt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;!His loss of innocence has come at a price, and once again the border beckons with its desolate beauty and cruel promise. 'The Crossing is like a river in full spate: beautiful and dangerous' The Times This edition is part of the Picador Collection, a new list of the best in contemporary literature published in Picador's 50th Anniversary year. McCarthy's eagerly anticipated new novels, The Passenger and Stella Maris, will be published by Picador in October 2022.!&lt;\n\n\n*I'm a bot, built by your friendly reddit developers at* /r/ProgrammingPals.  *You can summon me with certain* [commands](https://www.reddit.com/user/BookFinderBot/comments/13z7slk/bookfinderbot_commands/). *Or find me as a browser extension on* [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/book-finder/jajeidpjifdpppjofijoffbcndlpoedd?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social_media&amp;utm_campaign=comments). *Opt-out of replies* [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/BookFinderBot/comments/144zmjb/bookfinderbot_optout/). *If I have made a mistake, accept my apology.*",

Sophisticated, rich, powerful, and scholarly individuals can get away with weird quirks.  And may even appreciate certain complex experiences more than others, at least within the fine arts.  Making a monstrous villain from that formula can be potent.  They are not just doing evil for ideology or due to a bad beat from life, they love evil for the pleasure it gives.  \n\nThe Judge is &gt;!particularly scary and unnerving since he's just found, as is.  And the gang's leader is the only one who really grasps what they've found (something that is pure evil, like they are slowly becoming).!&lt;\n\n&gt;!He's sort of their Ferryman for crossing that last distance into death itself, assisting them with technical knowledge and social cunning.!&lt;",

He wafts his hat and the lunar dome of his skull passes palely under the lamps and he swings about and takes possession of one of the fiddles and he pirouettes and makes a pass, two passes, dancing and fiddling all at once. His feet are light and nimble. He never sleeps. He says that he will never die. He dances in light and in shadow and he is a great favorite. He never sleeps, the judge. He is dancing, dancing.

He is pale and thin, he wears a thin and ragged linen shirt. He stokes the scullery fire. Outside lie dark turned fields with rags of snow and darker woods beyond that harbor yet a few last wolves. His folk are known for hewers of wood and drawers of water but in truth his father has been a schoolmaster. He lies in drink, he quotes from poets whose names are now lost. The boy crouches by the fire and watches him.*\n\n*Night of your birth. Thirty-three. The Leonids they were called. God how the stars did fall. I looked for blackness, holes in the heavens. The Dipper stove.*\n\n*The mother dead these fourteen years did incubate in her own bosom the creature who would carry her off. The father never speaks her name, the child does not know it. He has a sister in this world that he will not see again. He watches, pale and unwashed. He can neither read nor write and in him broods already a taste for mindless violence. All history present in that visage, the child the father of the man.*",

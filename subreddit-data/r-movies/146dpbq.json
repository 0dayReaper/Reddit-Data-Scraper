    "postText": "I'm sure this has been asked before but I can't remember the right key words. Anyway, I can think of a lot of movies that fall in this general space with girls... Mean Girls, Heathers, Jennifer's Body, Easy A, Lady Bird, Booksmart, kinda Turning Red (a bit younger)... and even one that's more serious... Edge of Seventeen... plus there's also Clueless and 10 Things I Hate About You. But if I wanted the main characters to be boys then there's only one that I'd really count, i.e. The History Boys, plus three more sort ofs (10 Things I Hate About You, again, plus Back to the Future and Brick).\n\nSo, uh, what else is there?",

            "comment": "I gather you're looking for something involving boys that concerns school politics and social standing. You're right that there aren't many movies that concern themselves with boys and social standing in the same way as they do girls. Boys traditionally tend to establish their social standing in a less verbalized way compared to girls (size, strength/athleticism and looks tend to factor more than verbal skill/gossip in establishing one's social standing), and many Hollywood movies reflect this fairly old fashioned mindset. But there are still some out there that emphasize the social aspect more.\n\nFor a recent example, you might want to give 2017's \"Wonder\" a try. It's about a deformed boy navigating the social politics of his school and there's a lot of rumor mongering and social backstabbing and the like in the film.\n\nThough fairly simplistic  (essentially: nerd spends entire film preparing to fight bully after school), you might also want to give Three O'Clock High a try as the entire movie occurs in the school and you get a look at the different types of students that make up the school.",

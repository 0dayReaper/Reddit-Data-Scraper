    "postText": "Hi all, it\u2019s me again. I ranted about their closed captioning devices weren\u2019t charged on other day. So I finally decided to come and watch Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3. The device was charged which is good news. I sat on my seat and waited. The device was showing \u201cTop 50 quotes of the movies\u201d and all the quotes were showing on the device. As the movie started, nothing changed. 5 mins into the movie, nothing. So I went to the front and told them the problem. They gave me another one so I went back inside, same thing. I complained and they were like \u201cwe are so sorry, we are still not used with new machines. Here are two tickets for you\u201d. I\u2019m so fucking sick of being deaf and not able to enjoy my day after a long day at work because they couldn\u2019t get the device working. This is exactly why I stopped going to the movies",

Extremely well acted and accurate throughout \n\n-Savarin going off on Mark Zuckerberg after smashing his computer in The Social Network. Incredibly display of the feeling of anger, betrayal, and frustration that he felt \n\n-Sam screaming at Grace in Brothers. This one is especially great because of all of the build up with what he had to go through to get to her  and the fact that it was a reaction to something that was completely untrue. Best display of internal anger I\u2019ve probably seen on screen \n\n-Pretty much the entirety of 12 Angry men \n\n-Woody and Buzz in Toy Story",

    "postText": "Sorry if this isn't the best subreddit to ask, but has anyone figured out a good way to stream 4k movies? I have a 4k capable TV but I have no idea if anything I'm watching is reaching 4k quality.\n\nI'd like to for instance, buy a \"uhd\" film on Amazon and just stream it thru my smart TV's amazon app, but there's no settings or indications of what quality is coming thru. I know youtube is basically a scam with setting movies at 720p, so I'm now very untrusting of any other streaming site.\n\nI don't have a fire stick or chromecast device, do I have to use that in order to get 4k quality? (Or should I just give up on that and buy a player and dics?)",

Another option is to get an Apple TV and get 4k from there(this is the best streaming 4k quality from what I understand). \n\n4k discs do look better though than even Apple TV, but most people will not notice a huge difference",

My worry being they're calling 1080p \"UHD\" even tho the common perception is 1080p is \"HD\"\n\nIf 4k discs really are better I might just bite the bullet and get a player. Good to know.",

If you do use any equipment like a stick make sure it's packaging says its rated for 4k. Again the display button usually works to get the readout of what your current display is doing. Again make sure you are playing the actual media when you check. \n\n\nThat said, I don't like streaming so I do discs and the quality always beats streaming. And if you do get a uhd 4k disc player make sure the HDMI cable is also rated for 4k.",

So it must be a limitation of my built in player (or possibly my connection speed but that shouldn't the issue here)\n\nSounds like I just need to get a player thanks guys. Trying to buy and stream 4k movies just doesn't seem to be a good idea in comparison.",

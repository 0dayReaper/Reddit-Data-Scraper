            "comment": "&gt; Seoul Metropolitan Police on Tuesday raided the offices of Korea\u2019s three leading multiplex cinema operators and three film distributors.\n\n\n&gt; \u201cThe six entities are accused of obstructing the business of the Korean Film Council (KOFIC) by falsely counting the audience numbers for Korean films,\u201d a spokesman for the police is reported to have told Korean media, according to the semi-official Yonhap news agency. The raids were conducted by the force\u2019s anti-corruption and public crime investigation team.\n\n\n&gt; Local media named the companies visited by the police on Tuesday as cinema chains CJ CGV, Megabox and Lotte Cinema, and distributors Showbox, Lotte Entertainment and Kidari.\n\n\n&gt; Distributors and cinema operators electronically transmit ticket sales and revenue numbers to KOFIC\u2019s Korean Box Office Information System (Kobis). Kobis aggregates, analyses and publishes the data online. KOFIC also uses the data to calculate a 3% ticket tax which feeds a \u201cfilm development fund.\u201d",

            "comment": "Wow thats crazy. I went in thinking \"why would you falsify attendance numbers when ticket sales is what matters\". But that makes sense because Ive never heard of that ticket tax before. Also, Im just used to seeing box office $$s  rather than hearing about attendance numbers, so maybe we dont have that same kinda policy here. It does seem like a strange thing to lie about still though because if they look at the data and see attendance doesnt match up with ticket sales, even with the coupons, they are of course going to look into it. That being said...hell, I wish theaters here did that. Theater companies keep talking about how the business is failing and they are losing millions hand over fist, but tickets are more expensive now than they were before the pandemic. My local Regal is charging 2$ more for the average ticket price and dont have any of the good stuff like IMAX options.",

But they're also a little bit like the American MPAA or whatever they're calling themselves now; the censorship isn't so much that they get to edit movies or decide whether or not they can play as that filmmakers have to produce art they know will be acceptable to them in order to be successful.\n\nI prefer my art honest, thanks",

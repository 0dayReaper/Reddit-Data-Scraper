Likely when Fantastic Four gets back to Marvel and they succesfully work them into a Galactus/GotG crossover utilizing the new Avengers and the new GotG. \n\nWhile Sony continues to make gobs of money off of licensing Spidey and company back to Marvel/Disney. Plus the Incredibles drive a new round of Disney Superhero cash cows.\n\nAt the same time a new market for \"girl\" heroes starts to need to get tapped ESPECIALLY post Captain Marvel. She-Hulk joins the New Avengers along with Hawkeye (girl variant). Marvel/Disney will want Invisible Woman.\n\nAll the while eyeing the most famous \"girl\" heroes sitting in the X-men stable of Jean Grey, Rogue, Storm, White Queen, Jubilee, Psylocke/Revanche, Silver Fox, Lady Deathstrike, Spiral, Blink, and more. While cursing their limited selection still left of Squirrel Girl, Mockingbird, and Kamala Khan (assuming she doesn't get swallowed in the Inhumans show).\n\nThey'll fold. Like paper. \n\nI still believe!",

His principal mutant powers are his vast telepathic and telekinetic abilities. He can employ the latter to levitate objects and to create protective force shields. He must continually employ his telekinetic powers to prevent the techno-organic virus from affecting the rest of his body. His techno-organic left arm and shoulder possess even greater strength than his entirely organic ones. Cable\u2019s techno-organic right eye can see into the infrared portion of the spectrum.\u201d*",

    "postText": "I usually watch movies on my 40 inch TV, make some popcorn and chicken wings, with beer or vanilla coke. But today was different because I just got home from watching a movie (Glass Onion) at a friend's home. I should add \"wealthy\" friend because he has a home theater.  He said the whole thing cost him about 20k. But it was glorious, the big screen, the surround sound, the whole atmosphere. There were all kinds of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, plenty of snacks (I had too much Doritos Flamin Hot Nacho). He ordered pizza from a local joint too (I had the vegetarian) which we ate afterward when discussing the movie. There were four of us and we had a blast. Wish you guys were there too.\n\nAnyhow, wanted to ask how you guys usually watching movies at home? Do you make a big deal out of it, like turn off the lights and get snacks and set the atmosphere or just watch the movie on your laptop?",

One of us chooses the theme and then programme in 7 films. 1 Friday, 3 Saturday and 3 Sunday. If it gets dark early enough we'll often use a projector for the last film of the day. \n\nWe consider the lineup and what type of film we want to see at a given time. So Saturday night might be a popcorn fun adventure time movie and Sunday afternoon could be a nostalgic or easy to watch film. \n\nAnd we'll also try and make our drinks and snacks tie in with the theme. For example, we did a circus theme once and had Candy floss and Slush Puppy drinks. \n\nIt's my birthday next week and I am currently planning a space themed film lineup. I have most of the films picked out and we have a galaxy light for ambience. But need to figure out what kind of snacks and drinks would fit in to a space themed movie festival",

I have all of that hooked up to my dad's old sound system he got rid of after he upgraded his system. I have three Polk Audio speakers, a left, a right, and a center channel with a Yamaha subwoofer that's all controlled through a Yamaha RX-V995 receiver. I set it either to Pro Logic, Adventure 70mm, or General 70mm for most of the movies I watch to get the most out of the system. It's not full surround sound because I don't have any back channel speakers, plus with the way my living room is set up, I wouldn't be able to use any anyway, but it's plenty loud and clear for my needs.\n\nFunny story about this sound system though, in 1999 my dad bought the receiver, all of the speakers, the subwoofer, and a fancy five disc DVD player on a whim and did NOT tell my mom. So, he dropped a cool $5K in one afternoon and just showed up back at home and started setting it up like it wasn't a huge chunk of change. She was *not* happy, but we got tons of use out of it, cuz hell, the only thing that crapped out was the DVD player, and that was only a few years ago. \n\nMy wife and I watch a fair bit of movies together, but she knits, so she needs a light on at night, which is not ideal for me, but it doesn't bother me enough to be an issue. She does go to bed much earlier than I do though, so I get to curate my own viewings after she goes to bed. I shut the door to the kitchen to help cut some of the noise down, thankfully our bedroom is on the other side of the house, and she keeps the door shut AND sleeps with a pillow over her head so I can keep the volume up fairly high, within reason. Then I shut all the lights off, pull any blinds that are still open, clean my glasses, refill my water, grab another beer or glass of wine if I feel like it that night, and if I'm doing a snack it'll most likely be sour Haribo gummy bears, regular Haribo gummy bears, or some good ultra bitter dark chocolate. Then I grab a blanket, kick back in my spot on the couch, and enjoy my night!",

Typically capped off with coffee or whiskey prepared during a bio break towards the end of the movie. \n\n\nBut sometimes if it's a lazy day we'll just throw on the LOTR extended trilogy in bed on a 12 year old 32 inch screen.",

Got it at a bargain price (nearly 50% off).\n\nAudio is Hifiman HE-400i headphones with ZMF Ori pads.\n\n1. Hifiman makes planar magnetic headphones, which have much faster and more accurate bass response. They can actually make sub-bass notes that can help you perceive rumble. Not as impactful as a subwoofer, but better than typical dynamic headphones.\n2. The OEM earpads are too small for my ears. The ZMF pads share the same external dimensions, but have a larger internal cavity and are deeper. More depth normally ruins bass, but the OEM pads are partial velour (which leaks bass) while the ZMF pads are full leather (which traps the bass in the cup), which offsets the depth.\n\nHeadphones connect via Schitt stack. Modi DAC and Asgard 2 amp. The Asgard can be best described as like listening after a few sips of a nice whiskey; it's a relaxing experience. These are fairly cheap in the world of headphone audio, but never felt the need to upgrade.\n\nIn between the amp and DAC is a Loki EQ. I dial the bass up a bit (as bass is usually a bit light on planars) and pull down on the highs slightly to avoid sibilance and it creates a proper cinema audio experience.",

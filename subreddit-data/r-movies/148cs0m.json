They captured the essence of the Flashpoint story and I really enjoyed Ezra\u2019s performance as Barry, but the movie was definitely overhyped. As much of a DC/Flash fan that I am, objectively speaking Across the Spider-Verse and GOTG3 are much better movies. \n\n I think I would give it a 7.5/10.",

Movie is terrible.\n\nIt's amazing how they think that every single hero is too weak to carry a movie for himself, so they throw all kinds of shit in the mix ti save it. Everyone hates Ezra? Let's add 2 Batmans! \n\nIt's Batman v Superman all over again.",

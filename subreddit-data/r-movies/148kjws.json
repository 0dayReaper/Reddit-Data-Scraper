    "postText": "ever since I was 18 I have always hated this movie ever since I first watched it. this movie is the pure epitome of awful. this movie is so bad it ruined my favorite cartoon show of all time Avatar The Last Airbender. I love that show so much it means so much to me I watched it a lot when I was 11 or 12 years old. I saw this movie 10 years after it came out I didn't see it in theaters back then cause I had no  knowledge of the show, the movie or M. Night Shyamalan. The Last Airbender is the worst movie of the 2010s it's the worst movie ever made. Yes I think this movie is worse than movies like Cats, The Emoji Movie and Dragonball Evolution. those are shit movies but The Last Airbender is WORSE than those movies combined. If I had kids not only would I let them watch the show first, but I would tell them how bad this movie is. this movie got the characters wrong, the movie was rushed, the acting is so bad. way to go Shyamalan you just took a giant shit and what made the show so great thanks a lot i hope your proud of yourself. if your a movie fan like myself or a fan of Avatar The Last Airbender like myself please stay away from this movie. PLEASE stay far away from this film. watch the cartoon show, stay away from this giant pile of shit. I wish I had earth bending powers so I could erase this movie from existence. every copy of this movie should be burned. The Last Airbender will always be the worst movie I've ever seen.",

DragonBall Evolution, the Netflix Death Note, and the live action Fullmetal Alchemist are all just as bad. I don't want this to come across as a defense of The Last Airbender - it's awful, but there are plenty of similar movies that are just as awful.\n\nWhen the ScarJo Ghost in the Shell is the good version of a subgenre, you know it's not a strong genre.",

Death Note and others just caused an aneurysm and I literally died. \n\nHowever I\u2019ve seen worse non LAA movies. I think the more you know / more invested you are the worse a bad movie feels.  There\u2019s a couple movies in the plot of another hobby of mine (running) and they\u2019re even worse.   You try to watch something like on a plane when there\u2019s nothing to watch but it causes you such pain to hear every word muttered by the actors that I\u2019d rather just jump out to my death, again.",

This went on for months until a doctor finally figured out what was going on.\n\nSo, eventually, I had the gall bladder removed, but the anesthetic really messed with my body. I remember waking up after the surgery to more pain than I'd ever felt before. Immense pain. They put me back under and fixed the issues.\n\nLater, when I finally got back to my parents' house, I could barely move. I was dizzy, nauseous, and still in pain. At night I'd sleep on the bathroom floor, during the day I barely ate. I lost about 30 lbs in a matter of a few weeks from undernourishment.\n\nOne night, I was in the bathroom, and my parents were across the hall watching a movie. They had rented two different ones, hoping we'd all be able to sit together and watch - it was a nice gesture by them! But I was too sick, so instead I sat with my head in the toilet while they watched, and I was too weak to move away.\n\nThe movie they were watching was the Last Airbender, after all the pain and sickness I'd been through, this was the lowest point of the recovery for me.",

TLA is a literal case study in how to completely and utterly fuck up an adaption. Even ignoring the (2010 corrected for inflation) budget of 200+ million USD and the accompanying expectations that such a budget brings with it, Shyamalan completely dropped the ball. \n\nExtremely bad casting and acting, horrible (and even *literally unfinished)* CGI even for the time, a screenplay laughably full of narration, repetition, or just overall bad lines (there is literally a line in the film where Katara asks someone their name, *by bloody addressing them with their name when asking the question*. This is the level of quality of the dialogue we're talking about). There are countless examples of inconsistencies, character changes, or just simple illogical things the characters wouldn't say or do. To list them all would take hours, so I'm not gonna do that, and I think my point is clear. There are many YT videos you can watch if you want to hear them all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOw, and lastly, this is coming from someone who watched TLA *once,* and only because it was recommended to me because of its excellent writing. I couldn't care less about the anime itself. I just appreciate good film making, which Shyamalans The Last Airbender *most certainly is not.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[here, enjoy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgV9vymLIdQ&amp;t=61s)",

A friend convinced me to watch it when it hit netflix and I ended up being obsessed with it and even read all of the comics. I decided to have a little viewing party to make fun of it with that friend. Coming back to it as a fan was so much worse lol. I came with the intention to watch a bad movie and crack jokes and couldn't even laugh because it was just THAT bad.",

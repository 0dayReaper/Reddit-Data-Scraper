Its not exactly john wick like worldbulding.. Nor its an all emotional movie",

It's kinda like Con-Air but they're trapped on a boat with a maniacal genetically enhanced super-soldier and a bunch of other bad guys and it has a butterfly knife fight scene in there (+ some other fun stuff).\n\nOh and [Pathaan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oYlBZ_qQng) comes to mind for recent knife combat. The action scenes are very solid, if you don't mind a the background music.\n\nAlso, not a movie, but you might enjoy this fight scene from the excellent Banshee tv show: [https://youtu.be/tteRVQ7Z9qE](https://youtu.be/tteRVQ7Z9qE)",

Like, the lore is pretty dumb, but the action and gore and over-the-top characters make up for it. I can see why ratings are low though. If you aren't into what is essentially a far gorier Resident Evil mixed with Con-Air, then you won't like it. \n\n&gt;I think there was a tv show from 2021 or something that had some martial arts stuff (from korea)\r  \n\r\n\nYou might mean Vincenzo? But like, personally I would recommend Taxi Driver over that if you were going for an action drama. That's more punching than knife fights though. It's a revenge show where a Taxi service takes on cases that won't get justice through the police system and solve it through violence and infiltration.",

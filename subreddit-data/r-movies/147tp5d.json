The most recent past season, Elliot\u2019s character reflects his real-world transition during the events of the show. \n\nAs for acting style\u2026.. I mean, the entire point of acting is becoming someone you are not, which Elliot already had down pat, just to survive in our actual world. But one thing I did notice in the most recent season of Umbrella academy, was Elliot\u2019s physical demeanor while on camera. \n\nNot as the character but the actor playing the character. There was a sudden lightness in his performance. Body language was completely different from previous seasons. He stood taller, seemed more focused and into character. Can\u2019t be sure if that was scripted, or just a result of finally being allowed to be himself no matter the character portrayed.\n\nWhatever the case, there is a definite and observable shift, from his days as Ellen as opposed to Elliot, in body language and confidence, on camera. \n\nHandsome, talented, humble and now confident in who he is? Elliot\u2019s gonna take over Hollywood.",

Most people have had to fit in with the eternal high school that is life. It's the internal conflict that branches off into different worlds: survival by conscious struggle, or by unthinking osmosis.",

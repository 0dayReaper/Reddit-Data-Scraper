CGI is probably one of the best things to happen to the TV and movie industry because it gives the producers so much more creative freedom, the same that comic book writers have. \n\nThanks for all the memories and the inspiration Stan.

The other actors were actually there on set, but they were a couple dozen feet away or so in a larger set while Gandalf was in the smaller set to make him look bigger. This was done because The Hobbit was filmed in 3D, so the same forced perspective tricks they used in LOTR wouldn't work when you could see the actual depth. However, the amount of times when they filmed like that was quite limited. Other times you'd simply have Gandalf standing higher than the Hobbits and dwarfs in closeups, or have standins for behind shots. Also, Gandalf had a lot of scenes with other characters his size so it wasn't necessary. ",

But more than any one person, he or she is responsible for the overall direction and vision and integrity of the project.\n\nStan had a hand in every Marvel book, wrote a ton of dialog, and usually gave at least the outline of the plot for every single issue.  He figured out what made each character tick, what made them unique, and what would make the reader care about them.\n\nThe Fantastic Four was a bickering family.  Spider Man was a teenage boy, whose powers if anything made his life harder, once he understood the responsibility that came along with it.  Tony Stark had to use his technology to keep himself alive, and eventually struggled with alcoholism.  Captain America was a man out of his time.  Hulk was a modern day Jekyll and Hyde.  The XMen explored racism and other forms of bigotry.\n\nI don't think Kirby or Ditko or any of the other artists ever did work nearly as good or successful after they worked with Stan.  I don't think that's a coincidence.",

When you lose that connection, if you don't have friends or close family there to help, it can be devastating. I think that's why losing a partner late in life hits men harder than women.\n\nIt's a good reminder to take care of our grandpas and our older gents. They might not ask for our friendship and care, but they need it. (We all do!)",

We were walking around and we saw Stan walking with a bunch of suits. We asked to take a photo and he was so happy to meet us and take a photo with us. He was warm, kind and inviting. He talked to us while the executives stood their looking at their watches. He was genuinely happy to talk with us and spend that little time with us. \n\nTwo years later, we went to SDCC and printed that photo. We knew it was a long shot to run into him at SDCC, but we would be upset if we missed an opportunity. We found a booth that was hosting Stan. They had Spider-Man guitars and if you bought one, Stan would sign them. We get there and there is this huge crowd. Stan comes and starts signing. My wife and I take out the photo in the middle of the crowd and hold it up high. After 10 minutes or so of signing, surrounded by people holding comics up to get him to sign, he spots our photo. He smiles and waves, then leans over to one of the booth employees and says something to him. The guys comes through the crowd and asks my wife to follow him. She walks all the way up to Stan and he talks with her for a minute or two and signs the photo. His mannerisms were so different toward my wife than they were to the people getting the guitars because this was something that was special to us. It has no monetary value. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/kgnSLWt",

This is when you pass from the mortal realm.\n\nThe second death is when the last person who knew you also dies the first death. This is when you pass from living memory.\n\nThe third death is when your name is spoken for the last time ever. This is when you pass completely from the human world.\n\nMr. Lee's contributions to literature and popular culture are unlike to be forgotten anytime soon, if ever. Accordingly, it is likely that he will never die the third death.\n\nSo, if you are like me, you can take some small comfort in that. He will be missed, but never completely forgotten.\n\nMr. Lee will never die the third death. He didn't completely die today, people. He became immortal.\n",

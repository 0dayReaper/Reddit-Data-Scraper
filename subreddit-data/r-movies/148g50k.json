Speculative fiction might fit better\n\nEdit: Respectfully I think this definition of magical realism describes Kaufman's books and movies to a T, maybe with the exception of Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.\n\n[It paints a realistic view of the world while also adding magical elements, often blurring the lines between fantasy and reality.\\[1\\] Magic realism often refers to literature in particular, with magical or supernatural phenomena presented in an otherwise real-world or mundane setting, commonly found in novels and dramatic performances.\\[2\\]:\u200a1\u20135\u200a Despite including certain magic elements, it is generally considered to be a different genre from fantasy because magical realism uses a substantial amount of realistic detail and employs magical elements to make a point about reality, while fantasy stories are often separated from reality.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism)",

The scene: a badass female main character who fights a lot and the guy\nIs super tall and extremely chiseled, think of pyramid head he had some of big weapon think. The setting was a white tile floor with white walls maybe an abandoned jail kitchen or shower l remember there was water on the floor im sorry if this is no help let me know if extra detail is needed and let me know if this is the wrong sub TIA",

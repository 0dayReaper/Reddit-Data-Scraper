I am fully of the belief that voice acting is an art that is very different from acting, but in a capitalist country, art will always need to compromise if it wants to reach a wide audience. That said, some celebrities are quite astoundingly good at voice acting. Bradley Cooper melted into the role of Rocket Raccoon seamlessly and created the greatest MCU character in the process. It ain\u2019t perfect, but every spider-verse style project opens doors for progress",

He also cited Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which premiered at Annecy and hits theaters in August.*\n\nSooo the key to doing fun things with animation is regurgitating IP or stories audiences are already familiar with an attaching a big name director to them.\n\nUn hunh. Un hunh. Go on about this brilliant strategy.",

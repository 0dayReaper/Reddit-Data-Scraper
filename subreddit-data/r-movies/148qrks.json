    "postText": "Finally got around to watching this one when I saw it got added to Prime Video, and WOW! One of the more compelling and stress inducing films I\u2019ve seen in a long time. \n\nThis film reminds me a lot of The Black Swan, where we see a character\u2019s obsession quickly become their downfall, as we see their obsession cause them to alienate those around them. This film does a masterful job is displaying the psychology behind it.\n\nJ.K. Simmons\u2019s performance as Fletcher easily stole the show. One of the best antagonists I\u2019ve seen in a film, right up there with Warden Norton from The Shawshank Redemption. Well deserved Oscar win for this one. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen it, this is a must watch. 10/10, what are some other good films that deal with obsession worth checking out?",

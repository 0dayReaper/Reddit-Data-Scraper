As a backup I\u2019d like a sequel to The Usual Suspects (I can make a pretty strong argument that \u201cyou know who\u201d is not \u201cyou know who\u201d).  I\u2019m also looking forward to the next movie in the Alien franchise, but it seems like I saw something somewhere where it will not be continuing from Alien: Covenant (which I\u2019d like to see) but will be a new group of people on some type of new mission.\n\nI definitely do not want to see Krull 2: Smell the Glave. I would also shy away from Breakin\u2019 3: Electric Boogaloo 2: Shake and Pop. I definitely do not want to see Rocky ?8?",

I\u2019m 21 years old and I absolutely adore 70s and 80s movies, as well as modern films. But something about the charm of older movies is unmatched.\n\nThanks for letting me rant on here lmao. Hopefully some of you can relate.\n\n\nEdit: wow I didn\u2019t expect this post to get so much attention. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is you\u2019re allowed to like whatever you want to like, but you can\u2019t call movies \u201ctoo old\u201d if you don\u2019t give them a chance. Classics are the reason we have what we do today.",

And if they act up, they will kick you out of the theater.   \n\nObviously, a movie theater will have a lower standard than most live theaters, but I thought this was a smart way to do things.

In the last 5 years [keeping in mind COVID shutdowns] I\u2019ve probably seen like 200+ movies at the theater.\n\nI can probably count on one hand the amount of really awful experiences I\u2019ve had.\n\nLike sure kids were talking during The Little Mermaid and Super Mario; but I went to both on opening weekend and they\u2019re kids movies, so I went in completely anticipating that and not at all bothered. Though the parents on their phones at full brightness the entirety of The Little Mermaid did bother the hell out of me [making it one of my not great theater experiences]\n\nOne of the worst recently was going to see that Book Club movie and this one lady just completely refused to sit in the seat assigned to her. By the time the movie actually started she was kicked from her seats by the people who were actually assigned them at least 6 times. . .I guess she bought the ticket late and was in the first row. . .because 10 minutes into the movie she just couldn\u2019t deal with it and left.\n\nBut in all, I feel it\u2019s very very rare that anything really spoils the experience for me.",

It's a different experience to see where people thought science would go vs how it is. \n\nIt definitely takes a kind of attention threshold to watch older films as they pace much much differently",

He made his own independent film short.  In an attempt to get noticed and it's astonishingly good.  It's about a mixed race actor who who struggles to make it in acting because he never fits the look that films are looking for.  He's surprisingly good in a serious dramatic role.  It was after big name directors, like Spielberg had seen his short film that he started getting roles.",

The only movies they knew were the disney movies they watched when they were kids and major blockbusters. I understand that we all have different backgrounds but like, you guys are in film school, everyday in class we learned about the history of cinema, the classics that made history, etc. For film students, they didn't seem to care. We played two rounds and then the game was constantly interrupted by them talking and not focusing.",

Both tend to fail with them for different reasons - the former is that it\u2019s just too corny or of a different time, while with the latter it\u2019s just that they don\u2019t have a full understanding of how to watch film in historical context yet. That\u2019s fine, tbh I\u2019m not sure I have a full understanding either. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve found is that the solution to getting them into older movies *isn\u2019t* accessible favorites like the ones you mention, but films that are crazier and bolder. I can\u2019t tell you how many students I\u2019ve had that come in saying they don\u2019t like older film, only to change their tune after I screen something like The Holy Mountain, The Heartbreak Kid, or Mishima.",

I steered away from them until my first film class in high school when we watched Casablanca, which I loved. \n\nMovie appreciation takes time and exposure, and modern movies are much more digestible for younger people. I had to first understand what a good modern movie looked like before I could appreciate older movies, such as Casablanca. \n\nI found my *love* for older movies when I took a horror film class in college. Since we were focused on one genre, we could traverse decades and find the connections to modern films. My favorites were Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and Dracula (1931). \n\nWhile it sucks for you that your friends/family won\u2019t watch older movies, it\u2019s their loss. If you *really* want to get them to watch some, I recommend doing what I did and explore the timeline of a single genre with them.

But the modern pacing, editing, structure and cultural lens of mainstream movies that we are so used to today was established in audiences over that period - and why so many films from that era hold up, where as you go back to the 60s, 50s, 40s, 30s and you really do see a completely different kind of movie.",

Then he complains about jokes relying on stereotypes, being racist, sexist, or homophobic/transphobic. Or, he says the special effects are bad and take him out of it. Even if there\u2019s no badly aged humor or special effects, just the fact it was made before 1990 seems to be too much for him to get over.",

Both tend to fail with them for different reasons - the former is that it\u2019s just too corny or of a different time, while with the latter it\u2019s just that they don\u2019t have a full understanding of how to watch film in historical context yet. That\u2019s fine, tbh I\u2019m not sure I have a full understanding either. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve found is that the solution to getting them into older movies *isn\u2019t* accessible favorites like the ones you mention, but films that are crazier and bolder. I can\u2019t tell you how many students I\u2019ve had that come in saying they don\u2019t like older film, only to change their tune after I screen something like The Holy Mountain, The Heartbreak Kid, or Mishima.",

The \"movie person\" who hates people that don't watch movies the way you think they should watch movies.  It's pretentious, elitist, and nonsense.

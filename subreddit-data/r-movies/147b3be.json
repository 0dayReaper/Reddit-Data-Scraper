    "postText": "I am an avid movie watcher and I caught a reoccurring item in the last two Oliver Stone movies I watched. In the movie The Doors, the nazi flag were shown on the television set during the screening of Jim Morrisons movie in front of his UCLA class. In the movie Platoon, towards the end after the bombing and Charlie Sheen wakes up and grabs his gun and shoots Tom Beringer there is a tank that shows up looking for people/bodies. It is flying a nazi flag. Does he do this in all his movies? Its so subtle that unless you watch the movie you might not even see it it. Its almost like subliminal messages? I in no way condone or approve of this sign of hatred. Just wonder why he does it?",

He had a whole speech about it. The kids were all like 6-8 years old.",

    "postText": " I've heard it has over 400 F bombs, and I sometimes don't like that. I love **Casino** and like **Wolf of Wall Street**, but it bothers me in movies like **Running Scared,** but I also thought it was over-the-top violent, more than **Casino** in some ways.\n\nDid you like **Summer of Sam**? What are your thoughts on the movie? I saw it at a thrift store but passed. I may get it if it is there on my next visit. ",

Spike Lee captured emotions of what NYC was going through that summer with SOS and a major blackout and the choas during, that why Spike makes films about NYC so well. (Scorsese too)",

His role in the Leo Decaprio Romeo and Juliet got me thinking this.\n\nHe's also an amazing comedian and his standup specials and films are more than just comedy. They are cultural commentary. Latino history for morons is amazing.",

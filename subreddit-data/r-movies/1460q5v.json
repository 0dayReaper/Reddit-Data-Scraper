    "postText": "**What's up Everyone at r/Movies I hope you guys are having a fantastic day**\n\n\nAs the release of **Oppenheimer** draws near, I find myself caught in a dilemma, and I need your valuable insights. You see, I live in Bangladesh \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\udde9, and unfortunately, we don't have IMAX theaters here. The buzz surrounding the movie has reached epic proportions, and it seems like everyone in the internet is excitedly discussing the mind-blowing experience that IMAX offers.\n(Even Christopher Nolan Himself!!)\n\n\nSo, here's my question to all of you who have had the privilege of watching movies on **IMAX: What is it really like? How does it compare to a regular theater experience?**\n\n\nI've always enjoyed going to the movies, immersing myself in the world created by GOATED \ud83d\udc10 filmmakers, and becoming engrossed in their narratives. But with the advent of IMAX technology, I can't help but wonder if I'm missing out on something extraordinary.\n\n\nFor those who have experienced IMAX screenings, could you please share your thoughts and describe the wonders of this larger-than-life cinematic adventure? Is the visual impact truly awe-inspiring? Does it heighten the overall movie-watching experience? How does the sound quality contribute to the immersion?\n\n\nMoreover, to those who have watched similar epic films, like Christopher Nolan's previous works, in both IMAX and regular theaters, I'm curious to know how the two experiences compare. Does the absence of IMAX diminish the impact of grand-scale movies like **Oppenheimer**, or can a regular theater still do justice to the cinematic brilliance?\n\n\nWhile I can't change the availability of IMAX in my country at the moment, your insights will help me set my expectations and appreciate the movie in the best way possible, considering the circumstances. Feel free to share any specific examples or personal anecdotes that showcase the magic of IMAX or highlight the merits of regular theater experiences.\n\n\nThank you so much in advance for your time and consideration, and let's continue celebrating the art of cinema together shall we!\n\n\n**TL;DR:** Oppenheimer is releasing soon, but my country lacks IMAX theaters. I'm curious to know what it's like to watch movies on IMAX and how it compares to a regular theater experience. Please share your insights and help me appreciate the movie to the fullest!",

The spectacle of a nuclear detonation really has to portrayed in the most terribly impact full way. Imagine the scene in Avatar where they are climbing up the cliff to tame those dino-birds, that my friend is what made that movie in IMAX a jaw dropping experience.",

            "comment": "70mm film projection is the ideal Christopher Nolan movie experience, and with Dunkirk at least, I'd say that's 50% of the movie because it's as much an experiment with the medium of 70mm film as it is a narrative movie, which doesn't hold up well without that element.\n\nWith 70mm film, the colors are a LOT crisper, the whites are a LOT brighter, the images have a sense of texture and depth and definition that does not exist on digital, the 6 or 8 track sound results in an audio experience that goes straight to the soul. In Dunkirk those sounded like actual planes, with some viewers who survived actual Dunkirk saying it sounded louder and scarier than their memories of actual planes.\n\nIMAX is bigger. That's the main difference, but many IMAX screens aren't film projection and even many of the lesser digital ones are \"LieMAX\" screens, meaning the screen is smaller than IMAX but they push the seats closer to simulate the effect.\n\nEven in the United States, most people have to drive for a long time to reach a true IMAX theater, film or digital. They are most often found in furniture megastores, aquariums, museums, space observatories... etc, and most aren't used to screen narrative movies.\n\nBasically, wherever you are in the world, the order of importance in considering your options goes like this:\n\n* 70mm film projection IMAX (extremely rare)\n* Not IMAX 70mm film projection (somewhat rare)\n* IMAX digital with laser (somewhat rare)\n* 35mm film projection\n* Not 70mm not laser digital IMAX\n* \"LieMAX\" (most screens claiming to be IMAX)\n* Not IMAX digital film projection.\n* Your friend's new TV, which he swears is better technology because theaters \"only have 2K\".",

The screen / projector / aspect ratio are all immediately irrelevant once the film starts, comfort and sound aren\u2019t.",

For safety reasons, the fire exit sign is also near the bottom of one of the screens and is lit up the entire time so when the movie plays with all 3 screens, which only happens sporadically, then you have a fire exit sign in the movie. \n\nAgain, I totally understand why these issues exist, but it\u2019s such a bad experience. I think the 2 screens also play at a different frame rate than the main movie, but that could have just been a one off issue when I went. \n\nI definitely don\u2019t recommend it for first time movie experiences.",

I was excited.\n\nSadly, it was a massive let down.\n\nAny lateral camera movement - ie left/right pans or tracking shots - stuttered so badly that the image was completely unwatchable.\n\nThere\u2019s one scene in particular that stuck with me, and that was a track of soldiers looking out from a ship as one of the boats sailed past.  You were supposed to feel the emotion of the soldiers however it was impossible to see their faces, because of the stutter.\n\nAt least the \u201cfake\u201d imax that you get at local cinemas is watchable, and cheaper.\n\nNote:  I used to go to the IMAX cinema in Birmingham before they started showing feature films.  Those films were always amazing.  I don\u2019t recall ever being that impressed by any of the feature films with IMAX content.",

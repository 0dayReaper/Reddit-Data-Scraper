            "comment": "&gt; **While France\u2019s overall animation sector employed 7,790 staffers last year, local grandees hope to see those figures swell to 15,000 by 2030**, and have thus made doubling the workforce the third key pillar of the wider Great Image Factory initiative.\n\n\n&gt; With nearly all the major animation studios and VFX houses developing outreach programs, partnering with existing schools, or offering mentorships, one studio is going to set up a brand new institution.\n\n\n&gt; Well, almost brand new. **In 2018, TeamTO launched ECAS (Ecole Cartoucherie Animation Solidaire), a Valence-based, no-tuition animation school meant to give underprivileged youths 3D training and to offer them a leg-up into the industry.** Running four years, and boasting a 98% success rate, the program would open for a nine-month term and then go dark again, with subsequent sessions sometimes in doubt.\n\n\n&gt; Though the program took a break this year, ECAS will return with a more sustainable and perennial model thanks to France 2030 support, introducing new curricula in compositing and VFX, and fielding greater interest from fellow studios looking for new recruits.\n\n\n&gt; **Past graduates include Fabien Nowak, who won Visual Effects Society accolades for his work on \u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d** and now heads FX at the Paris studio The Yard; **Jonathan del Val, who co-directed \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets 2\u201d and \u201cMinions: The Rise of Gru\u201d for Illumination; and Guillaume Rocheron, who won Academy Awards for his work on \u201cLife of Pi\u201d and \u201c1917.\u201d**",

    "postText": "Scream is my favorite movie of all time. I'm a film student and I love the horror genre, slashers particularly. Slasher films were dying by the '90s in my opinion, and Scream revolutionized it and brought it back and paved the way for studios. The resurgence period gave the horror genre a bigger budget and more exposure. It's a movie I can quote endlessly and never get tired of. What movie(s) that you'll never stop watching or get tired of until you die?",

Confidential is the best film of 1997, which was a really great year for movies, but it deserved its Oscar for Adapted Screenplay. Weird thing is the competition for that category wasn't that great, probably because the script for Jackie Brown wasn't nominated, although that was probably because Spike Lee (for right or wrong) complained about Tarantino's use of the N-word, and it's almost like Tarantino said, \"Oh, you think *that* was a lot?\" and then wins his second Oscar for Django Unchained fifteen years later.",

They feel like the films that made me realize, oh, there is a person behind the camera calling the shots, someone with a very specific, for lack of a better word, language. They kind of opened my eyes, in a way. \n\nWright\u2019s style is very inspired yet feels like nothing anybody else is doing or has done. At least those three films.",

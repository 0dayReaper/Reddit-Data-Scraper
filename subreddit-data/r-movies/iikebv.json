It's also kind of crazy that he died because generally the survivability of colon cancer is pretty high, like 90% localized, 60 to 70% if spread to organs. It says he was diagnosed at stage 3. Guess it just shows that even people with the best care in the world can succumb to colon cancer. RIP he was on his way to be an all-time great. He still left with an awesome filmography and legacy.",

One of my favorite parts of it - I went alone and I was kinda watching people the whole time - was the black family next to me, their very young son lost his goddamn mind for Black Panther. Chanting 'yibambe' the whole time.\n\nI thought it was precious then, but that's a treasured memory now. Seeing that kid be so into T'Challa is a permanent reminder of how important proper representation is, for me.",

I know Black Panther will always be what he was known but \"42\" was incredibly important and it was one of his most defining roles.\n\n---\n\n*For those wondering, Jackie Robinson Day is historically on April 15, but because it is a baseball tradition to recognize Jackie and the MLB season was delayed due to COVID, it was moved to today, August 28, for the year of 2020. The MLB released a touching tribute to Jackie earlier today which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxO6OQf293c).",

I was either screaming bloody murder because I was in pain or I was drugged up so much I couldn\u2019t finish a sentence without nodding off. It stated to get better and after 7 major surgeries, 30 radiation treatments, and now almost 80 chemo treatments later my cancer has been pretty stable. Had to get a permanent colostomy due to a hole in my bowels going to my bladder giving  me awful infections so that sucked but my life is great now. I am on chemo every 3 weeks and the only thing I have had to worry about is from my last scan which was a 1cm lesion on the very edge of my lung which my doctor said is very easily treated.

            "comment": "Risk factors\n\nFactors that may increase your risk of colon cancer include:\n\nOlder age.\u00a0Colon cancer can be diagnosed at any age, but a majority of people with colon cancer are older than 50. The rates of colon cancer in people younger than 50 have been increasing, but doctors aren't sure why.\n\nAfrican-American race.\u00a0African-Americans have a greater risk of colon cancer than do people of other races.\n\nA personal history of colorectal cancer or polyps.\u00a0If you've already had colon cancer or noncancerous colon polyps, you have a greater risk of colon cancer in the future.\n\nInflammatory intestinal conditions.\u00a0Chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, can increase your risk of colon cancer.\n\nInherited syndromes that increase colon cancer risk.\u00a0Some gene mutations passed through generations of your family can increase your risk of colon cancer significantly. Only a small percentage of colon cancers are linked to inherited genes. The most common inherited syndromes that increase colon cancer risk are familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome, which is also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).\n\nFamily history of colon cancer.\u00a0You're more likely to develop colon cancer if you have a blood relative who has had the disease. If more than one family member has colon cancer or rectal cancer, your risk is even greater.\n\nLow-fiber, high-fat diet.\u00a0Colon cancer and rectal cancer may be associated with a typical Western diet, which is low in fiber and high in fat and calories. Research in this area has had mixed results. Some studies have found an increased risk of colon cancer in people who eat diets high in red meat and processed meat.\n\nA sedentary lifestyle.\u00a0People who are inactive are more likely to develop colon cancer. Getting regular physical activity may reduce your risk of colon cancer.\n\nDiabetes.\u00a0People with diabetes or insulin resistance have an increased risk of colon cancer.\n\nObesity.\u00a0People who are obese have an increased risk of colon cancer and an increased risk of dying of colon cancer when compared with people considered normal weight.\n\nSmoking.\u00a0People who smoke may have an increased risk of colon cancer.\n\nAlcohol.\u00a0Heavy use of alcohol increases your risk of colon cancer.\n\nRadiation therapy for cancer.\u00a0Radiation therapy directed at the abdomen to treat previous cancers increases the risk of colon cancer.\n\nPrevention\n\nScreening colon cancer\n\nDoctors recommend that people with an average risk of colon cancer consider colon cancer screening around age 50. But people with an increased risk, such as those with a family history of colon cancer, should consider screening sooner.\nSeveral screening options exist \u2014 each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Talk about your options with your doctor, and together you can decide which tests are appropriate for you.\n\nLifestyle changes to reduce your risk of colon cancer\n\nYou can take steps to reduce your risk of colon cancer by making changes in your everyday life. Take steps to:\n\nEat a variety of fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\u00a0Fruits, vegetables and whole grains contain vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants, which may play a role in cancer prevention. Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables so that you get an array of vitamins and nutrients.\n\nDrink alcohol in moderation, if at all.\u00a0If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than one drink a day for women and two for men.\n\nStop smoking.\u00a0Talk to your doctor about ways to quit that may work for you.\n\nExercise most days of the week.\u00a0Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days. If you've been inactive, start slowly and build up gradually to 30 minutes. Also, talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program.\n\nMaintain a healthy weight.\u00a0If you are at a healthy weight, work to maintain your weight by combining a healthy diet with daily exercise. If you need to lose weight, ask your doctor about healthy ways to achieve your goal. Aim to lose weight slowly by increasing the amount of exercise you get and reducing the number of calories you eat.\n\n\nMake sure you know the dangers and get checked, my Dad is going through this at the moment.\n\nMany men feel uncomfortable about colon, prostate, testicular cancer etc never feel embarrassed about your health, never feel that way, your health is more important than anything else. \n\nRIP Chadwick Boseman, you got to see your impact on the world, but were taken too soon by a cruel disease.",

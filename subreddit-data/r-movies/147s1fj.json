    "postText": "So i just got finished rewatching the Muppet Movie, The Original from 1979, and it was absolutely perfect and amazing. The movie is the definition of a feel good movie. Which I feel the muppets were always the strongest at, and here it is not different. As we have a simple yet beautiful road trip movie about Kermit going to Hollywood to make it big, along the way making new friends, and finding himself a family. \n\nAll the puppet performances are top notch, obviously, it's the muppets, I kindof expect that, but the human actors do a great job as well, especially the villain. I think the comedy and humor is pretty funny and on point too, and the songs are very memorable and catchy, especially Rainbow connection and Gonzos song (not surprising, because he was always my favorite muppet), but what really works about this movie for me is the message and the drama.\n\nThe message about finding the courage to follow your dreams no matter the obstacles, do what you love, and make others happy while doing it, I think is a beautiful message and one I absolutely love, and relatable for me, as someone who's also trying to get into the film industry. However, i also think the dramatic moments hit really hard as well, when the didn't need to, and giving the film so much pathos and layers in the process. Not to mention the film has that charm that the muppets are beloved for.\n\nSo yeah, The Muppet Movie is one of the very few truly perfect movies out there. Also Orson Wells cameo was awesome. 10/10.",

            "comment": "One thing that was so great about the Muppets in its original run, on top of Henson and Co.'s unique approach and dedication to puppetry, was their sense of cinema. If you go back and watch the shorts on SNL and all that, it's clear that Henson was just as interested in making movies as he was in doing puppet shows. Telling stories that are legitimately funny and touching at the same time. Truly timeless stuff.",

At least, that's all I remember. It was just gentle talk between the two of them.\n\nI'm sure these extras are on youtube or something but they really are the true definition of extra!",

He had recently won \"Star Search\" as a ventriloquist, so he had a bunch of puppets; we took all his puppets to the university's showing of \"The Muppet Movie\" and had a wonderful time. For some reason, it was easier to talk to girls with a puppet than it was directly.",

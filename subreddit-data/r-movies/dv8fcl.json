They called out the green eye color saturation mismatch as being a clear indicator of animation being done by a team that  does not understand how to integrate computer graphics and real world footage.  His eyes aren\u2019t generating green, so there\u2019s no real way for them to look so green.  \n\nIt\u2019s easier for our brains to adapt to little blue furry people than to breaks in our understanding of how reality works.  It looks like many fixes like this went into the redesign.",

Look at the eyes and mouth; they're cartoonish but not overly so. But unlike DP, Sonic is an outrageously cartoony character in his proportions. Thus, in making the design straddle the line between realistic and cartoon, they strayed too far from god's light and into oh god stamp on it with your boot heel territory. The new design cats off every attempt at realism bar the animation textures and tbh looks much better for it.",

I also found that if I sit down when I get home from work I never get back up. Just change and go to the gym, don't even give it a second thought. So basically, find a close gym, change at the gym or immediately at home, and just keep reinforcing yourself that medical issues are more expensive than a gym membership. Good luck my dude.",

Obviously that's not the movie they were trying to make, which is fine, but it would have been an interesting approach in its own right.

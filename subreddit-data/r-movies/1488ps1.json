    "postText": "First of all, I balled my eyes out while watching this. It\u2019s a beautifully made film that manipulates your emotions. When I first saw the scene of Leo receiving the news of Remi\u2019s death, I thought to myself, \u201cdid he really end his life over an argument?\u201d And that\u2019s why I\u2019m putting forward the idea that Remi might have some processing issues, as well as being very emotionally sensitive. He might\u2019ve not known how to cope with the situation if he did have a disorder that makes the situation more intense than it should\u2019ve been. Another thing that supports this is in the beginning of the movie when they were having a sleepover and they both couldn\u2019t sleep, Remi says he has trouble \u201cshutting off\u201d his brain to sleep. Nonetheless, it could be depression or just simply anger, too. This is just a theory that I think can be quite possible.",

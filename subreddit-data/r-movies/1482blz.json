    "postText": "  \n\nWhen you just want to relax in your pajamas on a rainy day or chill on a Sunday afternoon, what's the movie you put on?\n\nFor me, I have a soft spot for family comedies. Mr. Mom and Father of the Bride are two of my go to comfort films. Both films have some humor centered around fairly serious subjects that are handled light heartedly. \n\nMM has one of my favorite scenes where Michael Keaton\u2019s character tells his wife\u2019s boss about all the renovations he\u2019s doing and shows his cluelessness about electrical work! \n\nFather of the Bride is one my all time favorites. It gets into the heart of how crazy wedding planning can be while still being pretty funny. Something about 80s and 90s comedies that took on serious life events while not getting too heavy. They make great comfort movies!",

    "postText": "I think the low movie theater attendance numbers was a temporary phrase during 2020 and 2021. And yes, more people did watch streaming TV shows and movies, but I see it as they had to due to the circumstances. After a while, most people would want to go outside and go see a big and popular movie like in 2022 and 2023, then staying home and watching it.",

Halfway through the movie you feel like you've got your butt planted in a church pew.\n\nThe indie-theaters are better, they actually care more about the movie-experience and have better seats but usually they run fairly obscure movies, are terrible at marketing what they're showing and keep the runs surprisingly short. More than once have I discovered that one of the small places showed something I wanted to see, only to found out they stopped showing it three weeks ago.",

Unless it's a spectacle film, people think why do I need to spend a small fortune to go watch a drama, biopic, period film on the big screen. I would also add that the window in which the film comes out after being in cinemas is very short, people are also happy to wait knowing it will be available to stream in a couple of months after cinema release.",

In the 80s it was 6 months to VHS, then more time before it hit TV.  In the 90s it was 3 months to DVD, then more time for TV.    Now - it could be simultaneous, it could be 17 days, it could be 45 days, maybe 90 days.    \n\nI love the cinema, but it's expensive, people can be very variable and a bad audience can spoil the experience - and it comes down to is this something that I really want the cinema experience or want to see immediately that can't wait a month or two?    Even if I really want  to see it, if I don't see it immediately (when its really busy) it cycles out of the cinema so quickly I've probably missed it.\n\nThere are very few films that hit that mark for me (Dune pt2, Oppenheimer are the upcoming ones).   The last film I really wanted to see at the cinema (Glass Onion) had a really limited release so wasn't an option anyway.\n\nBack in the 80s and even 90s, I knew if I didn't go to the cinema, I would probably not see the film for 6 months to a year.  I'd either have to rent the VHS, buy the DVD or wait for it to come onto TV.     Seeing which movies were coming out on TV over the Christmas period was a major highlight growing up and we'd all be glued to watching the Christmas afternoon blockbuster.   Now, I don't even look.",

You think people went to the theater 150 times a year?\n\nPeople went more because they literally could only see films that way.

So theaters were the only way to see a film.\n\n&gt;try taking your kids to the movies and saying no snacks\n\nI do it ALL the time. If you 'have' to have snacks buy them at a grocery store.",

Life in general today is vastly different form life in the '30's and '40's. Baseball games were very common for people to attend and weren't overly expensive, the average for a Yankees stadium ticket now is $61.59(as of '22). See a difference? You are trying to compare life in context of movies of the past before TV, cable, VHS, DVD, and streaming. The theater experience has changed, they really aren't for just any film, they are for blockbusters now. People don't go 20 or 30 time a year any more, they go around 3 to 4.",

It\u2019s the same thing!\n\nThe crux of it is that trip to the movies for four of  to see The Mario Movie would run us $80-$100 all in. As \u201cspecial\u201d as it is to see it on the big screen and make it an adventure for our kids it\u2019s not worth it. Especially when six weeks after it debuted we can buy it for $30 and watch it over and over and over on a large 4K screen. I\u2019d love to go to the movies 10+ a year like I used to but for several reasons, including cost, I cant. \n\nFinally viewing habits of the golden age are at least somewhat relevant because it shows the level of drop off and the change in relative cost. You can google it yourself if you wish but in the 1940s, Americans went to the movies twice a week on average and in the 1940s and 1950s Hollywood produced literally thousands of movies each year.

Too loud, too much effort, uncomfortable, everyone there is annoying, and also too expensive.\n\nInstead, I have a 115\" projector and a great surround sound system (currently upgrading to Atmos/auro3d).  Have I spent more than 10 years of going to the cinema? Hell yes. But has it been fun planning and building it? Yeah.  Can I now also pause it and go to the loo when I want.  Yep.  Can I also then adjust the sound to the levels I like.  Yep.  Make my own popcorn? Yep.  Fall asleep on the recliner and have to watch it another time.  Ha, yeah that too.\n\nIt's just a nicer experience watching at home imo.",

Unless movie is big budget event then people go to see in movie theater. Also i noticed that after month 1 or 3 they often at streaming service already so people mostly wait at home. Well there are anticipated movies i often wait which is not mainstream but obscure then it is chance that u won\u2019t see it at streaming after month so i often try to catch it in indie theater until it is gone after week.",

The only movies I've watched in theaters since the pandemic have been anime and the last 007 movie.  The cost wasn't an issue for me as I go alone, and don't eat the food there (though, having an Alamo Drafthouse nearby may change that), and I feel like I've been to theaters enough to know when the best and worst times to go are if you want a decent theater experience.  If I ever go back to seeing movies multiple times a week or even once a week, I'm definitely taking advantage of a subscription plan to save money.  I was kinda weary about those plans for a while because of that fucking MoviePass fiasco.",

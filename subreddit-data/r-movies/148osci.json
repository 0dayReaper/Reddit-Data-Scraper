    "postText": "There is always something about how studios create villains for animated movies, that they become a big part of why we enjoy them as adults. Although the story, the writing and humour can also play a part in why they\u2019re still enjoyable as adults, but I honestly find villains one of the real best parts of them.\n\nYzma and Kronk will always stand at the top of the list for me, it was \u201cchampagne casting\u201d at its finest! Eartha Kitt with her energetic voice acting, and Patrick Warburton using just his natural voice to steal the show. \n\nDespite their dark attempts to kill the protagonist (Kuzco) and rule the Empire, they added a sense of lightheartedness with their quick-witted one liners!",

The protagonist is simply the most central character of the story, who we follow, and the antagonist is a character (or, in some cases, a force or group of characters) who wants something that directly conflicts with what the antagonist wants.\n\nIt does often fall to protagonist wanting to save the world and the antagonist wanting to end it or take over, especially in superhero media, but Megamind is a great example of the exact opposite thing in action.",

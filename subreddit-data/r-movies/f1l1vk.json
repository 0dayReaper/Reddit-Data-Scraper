(This is the only category that others who participated in the film are allowed on stage however.) There were only two producers, Kwak Sin Ae, who spoke first, and Bong Joon Ho, who clearly wasn\u2019t going to speak since he was far off to the side. So when Kwak Sin Ae finished, it was entirely reasonable for production to think it was time to move on. The lighting cues are already programmed and cameras start moving into their next cue, so when they realized someone else was speaking, it took a few moments to reset to the previous cues. Which they did in quick order - although even a second delay feels like an eternity in live TV.",

Even more amazing that it took 90+ years of film for this to happen!\n\nEDIT 2: some are saying 2011's The Artist (France) was the first foreign film to win. I partly agree which is why I originally said first Asian film. However it was a silent film and the spoken dialogue at the end is English, thus one could argue it doesn't fully count as a 'Foreign Language' film.",

Not only has a foreign language film won, but it\u2019s a richly deserving one and wouldn\u2019t even be the usual kind of movie that wins if it was in English!\n\nFucking bravo.

And now, Parasite gets 4 wins (Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director and Best International Feature Film) out of 6 nominations (which also includes Best Production Design and Best Film Editing), and Bong Joon-Ho, the film's co-writer/director/co-producer, won all four of them.\n\nEven better, It is also the 3rd film ever to win the Oscar for Best Picture and Palme d\u2019Or / Best Picture of the Cannes Film Festival - after 1945\u2019s [The Lost Weekend](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037884/awards?ref_=tt_awd), which won the the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film/Grand Prize of the Festival, and 1955\u2019s [Marty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048356/awards?ref_=tt_awd), which became the first film to win the Palme d'Or since [it was first introduced that year.](https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/69-editions/palme/a-brief-history-of-the-palme-d-or) Both films won four awards in the Oscars as well - Best Picture, Best Writing (Adapted), Best Director and Best Actor.

She was not a listed producer, as has been commonly misreported.\n\nTo be fair, her company has been funding quite a few of these mildly left-wing critiques of class inequality, and actually was asked by the last president of Korea to stop producing these movies. \n\nSo I am glad she had the last word, even if she is part of the elite that the movie skewered. That last president is now in prison for corruption, by the way, and the \u201cbrother\u201d that Miky was thanking during the speech for funding the movie was also convicted of tax fraud but pardoned by the president that is now in jail.\n\nEdits:\n\nMore context from THR: https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/meet-important-mogul-south-korean-entertainment-1275756\n\nTwitter thread which is related: https://twitter.com/becky_kybae/status/1226726664463437824?s=20",

When Parasite started picking up awards, and THEN got to 3, the story was clear. Bong thought his night was done, but he entertained us, and all of us were then thinking, \"What if they win Best Picture? What IF?\"\nAnd then... to cap it off, the story was complete, which was a satisfying ending.\nAwards shows don't often have this, since they are basically an X, Y and Z of handing out awards. But the \"story\" of this show really made it a better one.",

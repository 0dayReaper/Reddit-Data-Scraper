Either is fine, but the latter makes more sense and ties in better to the third movie, plus you get to see Jet Li play master and disciple, but either way they tell the same story.\n* Then end with Donnie Yen's psuedo-sequel to Jet Li's film, in **Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen (2010)** with Donnie Yen taking on the role of Chen Zhen.",

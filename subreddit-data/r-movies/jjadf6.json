I think this helps explain why Rudy was very much 'where did this guy come from!?' to the security guy.  \n\nSo he was hiding in a closet and got a text telling him it was time to jump out.  \n\nYou should watch the colbert interview though, they had a new clip of the crowd turning on country steve when they realized he was SBC",

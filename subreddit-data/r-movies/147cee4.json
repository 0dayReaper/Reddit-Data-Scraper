So what I want is amazing effects and visuals, they all don't necessarily have to be good movies, just look very good and visually great. Any others like this?",

Not even just food or water related, how did he survive the IMMENSE third degree burns all over his body. That shit kills people ON EARTH with the best medical care. Dude is like super strong as well, how he was living in broken down spaceship with what im assuming is very little food.\nWhy didnt their fucking ship constantly say heyz there is a random person on board, here is a permanent location on that fuckstick. No only when multiple people have died, she mentions that there is another person on the ship. \nReally sucks because everything else in that movie is great. The atmosphere, the performances, everything is actually great.",

    "postText": "I watched this masterpiece after more than 15 years.\n\nAnd boy,what a experience. This movie is PERFECT. There is not a single dull moment. Story,acting,music,directing everything is fantastic.\n\nBronson is just born to play dangerous,tough characters. Claudia Cardinale was sexiest woman in 60s. More importantly she had great character Jill. Jason Robards is superb as comic,sad but extremely dangerous bandit. And finally Henry Fonda as Frank was like devil incarnate. There is apsolutely nothing Frank wouldn't do. Even so, its still strange to see Fonda as truly evil bastard.\n\nIts #4 on my Leone's list. Music is perfect.\n\nAlso,it's shame there wasn't scene between Frank and Chayenne. That scene wouldn't be long considering both wanted to kill eachother.\n\nExcept 4 main actors, Gabriele Ferzetti deserve mention for his role as greedy Mr.Morton.\n\nGreat example where greed cost guy everything. Not that Mr.Morton wasn't already dying. \n\nIts movie about change. From old west to civilization.\nAn Ancient History. Guys like Harmonica,Frank and Chayenne are dying breed. Guys like Morton will killing it.\n\nWhat I really love is that characters are not true heroes. Everyone are ready to play dirty if needed.",

It is excellent, as you said, but the stuff with Claudia Cardinale's character kinda drags the movie for me. It's not entirely, bad, but for the life of me I just have a hard time recalling everything with her arc. It does help set the backdrop of civilization coming to these frontiers. And I always felt the way Harmonica and Frank made their advances on her were strange and awkward, but maybe that's the point.",

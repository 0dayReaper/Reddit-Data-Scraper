    "postText": "Hey r/movies,\n\nI've recently been delving into the fascinating world of Cemetery Man (1994), a cult classic Italian horror film directed by Michele Soavi. I've stumbled upon conflicting information regarding the source material for this intriguing movie, and I'm hoping someone can shed some light on it.\n\nAccording to the ever-reliable Wikipedia, Cemetery Man is listed as an adaptation of the \"Dylan Dog\" comic. However, my research has led me to discover that Cemetery Man is also associated with a book called \"Dellamorte Dellamore.\" Now, I'm left wondering: which one is it?\n\nI've tried searching online, but I've encountered contradictory information, leaving me more confused than ever. So, dear movie enthusiasts, I turn to you for help. Can someone please clarify whether Cemetery Man is primarily based on the Dylan Dog comic or the Dellamorte Dellamore book? Or is it a combination of both?\n\nIt would be great if anyone could provide some reliable sources or insights to settle this debate once and for all. Let's unravel this mystery and satisfy the curious minds of horror fans everywhere!\n\nLooking forward to your expertise and input!",

That's the Dylan Dog connection.",

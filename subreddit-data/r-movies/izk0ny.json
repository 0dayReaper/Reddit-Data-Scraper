He then told me the entire last 20 minutes of the film he was thinking \u201cmy friend said it\u2019s not a sad ending\u201d over and over until the scene in the mountains...

Do they really think poor people would just roll over and die when their time ran out? Especially since apparently robbing time banks is pretty easy if you have a gun. \n\nThe crime rate would sky rocket 10,000% as people went on robbery and rape and murder sprees when their clock got close to zero. Even if they caught, they either just run out of time and die, or are given more time so the courts can punish them. So basically you either get more time to live or die without being punished.",

She tells Mark that he doesn't have to be a prick and that his past actions and relationships with people don't have to dictate the person he is now and in the future.\n\nEven without the benefit of hindsight I think that hope for the future version of Mark in the quote is misplaced.

It's meant to tell an engaging story based on real events, and engaging stories tend to need something for the audience to empathize or least connect with. Hence the \"Mark Zuckerberg destroys his only friendship and ends up a lonely billionaire\" subplot. We can at least somewhat empathize with his loneliness, even if we can't forgive the rest.\n\n10 years ago, Zuckerberg wasn't the fully unmasked and unabashed public villain he is now. He was seen as an unscrupulous asshole but still underdog that came from nothing. The general feeling about him was a remarkable but deeply flawed person, and the movie reflects that, while hinting at the possibility he will mature one day.\n\n10 years later he's proved that hope wildly misplaced. You would never make that movie that way today.",

Crime goes down. The prison population doubles. Fraud by the rich wipes out 40 percent of the world\u2019s wealth. The rich get massively richer. No one goes to jail.\n \n&gt;\tIn search of a solution, journalist Matt Taibbi discovered the Divide, the seam in American life where our two most troubling trends\u2014growing wealth inequality and mass incarceration\u2014come together, driven by a dramatic shift in American citizenship: Our basic rights are now determined by our wealth or poverty. The Divide is what allows massively destructive fraud by the hyperwealthy to go unpunished, while turning poverty itself into a crime\u2014but it\u2019s impossible to see until you look at these two alarming trends side by side.\n \n&gt;\tIn The Divide, Matt Taibbi takes readers on a galvanizing journey through both sides of our new system of justice\u2014the fun-house-mirror worlds of the untouchably wealthy and the criminalized poor. He uncovers the startling looting that preceded the financial collapse; a wild conspiracy of billionaire hedge fund managers to destroy a company through dirty tricks; and the story of a whistleblower who gets in the way of the largest banks in America, only to find herself in the crosshairs. On the other side of the Divide, Taibbi takes us to the front lines of the immigrant dragnet; into the newly punitive welfare system which treats its beneficiaries as thieves; and deep inside the stop-and-frisk world, where standing in front of your own home has become an arrestable offense. As he narrates these incredible stories, he draws out and analyzes their common source: a perverse new standard of justice, based on a radical, disturbing new vision of civil rights.\n \n&gt;\tThrough astonishing\u2014and enraging\u2014accounts of the high-stakes capers of the wealthy and nightmare stories of regular people caught in the Divide\u2019s punishing logic, Taibbi lays bare one of the greatest challenges we face in contemporary American life: surviving a system that devours the lives of the poor, turns a blind eye to the destructive crimes of the wealthy, and implicates us all.\n\nhttps://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/218631/the-divide-by-matt-taibbi/",

He\u2019s honestly one of the worst kinds of toxic people, the kind that is stoic and lonely and thinks he\u2019s misunderstood while simultaneously burning every bridge that his friends and colleagues try to make with him. \n\nAnd from watching the movie, I ask myself, does he know he\u2019s a sociopath?

Which explains why Eduardo is basically the only one who doesn\u2019t come off as a dick. It was also being written as Eduardo was suing Mark. Like most movies there\u2019s probably a mix of some truth with a lot of made up stuff for the story, but whatever the truth I think it\u2019s safe to assume the movie is biased in his favor.",

At the core, the movie is about Marks and Eduardo's relationship and how they gradually grow apart as they fail to understand each other. The first half of the movie is basically Eduardo having all these great things happen to him while Mark is basically ignored and forgotten by his friends. After Facebook launches, there is a brief period where they are happy together until the reverse starts happening: Mark and Facebook are taking off while Eduardo is stuck looking for dead end advertising, getting slandered about chickens, and basically getting nothing done as he is forgotten. Eduardo does not really understand that Mark wants to be cool, popular and distinguished (like somebody in the Phoenix), and in the same way, Mark does not understand that Eduardo genuinely wants to connect and work with Mark to build something exciting, and that he has his own struggles too. \n\nEven to the end, Mark never hates Eduardo, telling Sean that he didn't need to be so rough with him, and only really starts to understand the value of his human connection with Eduardo after Sean is arrested and the movie is basically over. So in the end, I think of the movie more of a tragedy of somebody who does not understand himself or other people, rather then a story with a clear hero or villain.",

The movie makes their case against him seem like rich douche bags who are just using their massive legal resources to cut themselves into the action rather than showing the merit to their real life argument.

I don't know if people remember but at the time, that kind of validation from a Facebook friend request acceptance was something people cared about a lot. He's shown doing one of the most pathetic things you can do on the platform.\n\nThen, next to him the text appears \"Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history\" or something to that effect. The juxtaposition to this shot of a 20 somethings desperately looking for validation or perhaps real friendship and the reminder he has more privilege and power than anyone in his generation is fantastic. It tells us \"money can't buy you happiness\".\n\nAnd, from a film making stand point, that's really great. But in reality? That ending gives us a bit too much sympathy for Mark who deserves absolutely none.",

But now the pendulum.has swung the other way and TSN seems so prescient in its ugly portrayal of Zucc's amoral pursuit of power and his attempt to mould the world in his image.\n\n\nAlso Eisenberg literally played a supervillain in BvS.",

That scene where Alan and Ellie see the dinosaurs for the first time is chilling, like Spielberg perfectly captured the page from the book and put it onscreen. Add John Williams\u2019 score and it\u2019s pretty much a perfect cinematic moment.",

I also remember going through a book of dinosaurs and finding all the one from the Jurassic period\u2014they might be in the movie!\u2014because I took the title too literally.",

Better, with Blackjack and Hookers.\n\nThen he falls down a hill, breaks his ankle and gets eaten by compys. It's black comedy gold.",

They play a T-rex roar, Hammond gets scared and that\u2019s when he falls and breaks his ankle. Then the compys get him. I loved how Crichton made his death so unremarkable, like here is this super rich guy determined to do something big with his money, and he died like\u2026that.\n\nI did hate that Spielberg killed off Muldoon who was one of my favorite book characters (although he gave him the line \u201cClever girl\u201d).",

Nowadays seeing a CGI dinosaur, alien, spaceship, monster etc is fairly common but we had never seen anything like that before so it was incredible.  \n\nThe only other time I can think of feeling like that in a cinema was when I was a kid and the Star Destroyer went overhead at the beginning of Star Wars.",

It wasn't just speakers but an entire new environment. They were there for a week tweaking things. All said and done, we got to watch Jurassic Park a week or so before release in full digital sound (all movies were analog prior).  And it was amazing!!!  We had the volume turned up to 11 and you could hear every insect.  At the end (spoilers) when T. Rex roars, it was so loud that you felt like your organs were liquefying.",

                            "comment": "Yup - it's the physical effects that really make Jurassic Park's dinosaurs look so good.\n\nFor the baby raptor, the sick Triceratops and the Dilophosaurus, the effect is 100% practical. Stan Winston's studio built animatronics (robots with painted latex 'skin') with a vast number of points of articulation.\n\nThe Tyrannosaurus and raptors mostly use practical effects - more animatronics, and with the raptors, guys in elaborate suits - and switch to CGI for brief shots that show full-body movement. This works so well because the digital animators had the reference of the actual, physical creature effects to work from, so could create realistic lighting and texturing in a way that's difficult to achieve if you're creating the assets 100% digitally.\n\nThe Brachiosaurus is mostly shown in CGI, but had an animatronic for close shots of the head, so it could interact with the actors and foliage. This makes it feel like a tangible, physical animal, so when you see the digital versions, you're still taking with you that sense of it being a real thing.\n\nThe Parasaurolophus and Gallimimus are 100% CGI... but their movements are controlled by a go-motion armature, a physical effect, which does a lot to make their animation feel grounded and lifelike (same goes for the other CGI dinosaurs). And I think even these all-CGI dinosaurs are still rendered using physical models (albeit miniatures) as a lighting/texturing reference; the Gallimimus certainly was. And in most scenes with CG dinosaurs, they'll interact with the environment in some way - disrupting foliage, breaking through logs, knocking things over - and these will usually be part of the in-camera footage, prepared beforehand for the CG creature to interact with rather than just shooting coverage and handwaving \"we'll fix it in post\". These physical interactions again make the digital creatures feel tangible, part of the world rather than superimposed onto it.\n\n***\n\nSo while the film is mostly remembered as a landmark in digital effects, there's another story there, which is that it's arguably the all-time high water mark for animatronic work, and an unusually blended physical/digital approach to effects that many of today's films could be improved by learning from.",

I'm certain it's pretty new, I only started hearing it in the last 5 years or so.\n\nThe Fly and Jurassic Park were two of my favourite films as a kid, so Jeff Goldblum is an actor I've always liked. No one ever fancied him in the 90s though. No girls had Jeff Goldblum posters on their walls. All the mums liked Kevin Costner and later George Clooney, and all the girls liked boy band boys or pretty movie stars like Johnny Depp or Leonardo DiCaprio. \n\nIn the late 90s/early 2000s Goldblum segued into more sleazy roles in Wes Anderson films and Igby Goes Down, he continued to be a favourite of mine and he was always great playing an oily old pervert.\n\nSo what kicked off the whole sex symbol thing? Is it just from that meme of him with his shirt open in Jurassic Park? Have tastes changed? No one try telling me that he was always considered hot and I just didn't notice, because that's flatly untrue! He was never considered ugly, but he was never considered a sex symbol either.",

Remember the iconic shot of it walking out of the pen and doing it's big awesome roar? It's quite a distance behind Tim and Lex's car and in front of Ian and Alan's. When the T Rex breaks through you can see it tears down more than just the one bit where it came through. There are a few shots that show that a lot more of the fence came down and not just one hole. \n\nEDIT: It still doesn't make sense, since the car doesn't get knocked forward at all like it does in this image, and the cliff appears right where the goat was before, but it isn't the same hole the T-Rex broke through.\"\n\n[diagram](https://imgur.com/ZQ0KBHh.jpg)",

The atmosphere and style, for one thing, with all the dark, moody lighting and suspenseful scenes of being stalked by the raptors, etc\u2026 but also the severed limbs of both goat and Samuel L Jackson variety. The scene of Ellie in the underground power shed could be from an 80s slasher flick, with the raptor as the serial killer. Same with the kitchen scene. I don\u2019t think any other JP movie has done such an explicit horror style. They\u2019ve just kinda relied on the dinos being scary by default, which\u2026 they aren\u2019t really. Without the finesse of actively making them scary, they\u2019re just cool special effects onscreen. As such, the movies have just become watered down blockbuster action movies with more comedy and \u201cfun\u201d than horror.",

It had Spielberg\u2019s direction, and that helped it retain the most of that horror element. The compy scene, or even the trailer scene (for how over the top and actiony it does get) had a good dark rainy horror vibe to it as well. The suspense while giving back the baby rex as the mommy and daddy rexes wait outside. The cracking glass scene. The long grass scene. This is when Jurassic Park is at its best, with scenes like this balanced against the wonder and science-fiction and animal/nature themes of it all\u2026 but without Spielberg, none of the other films have had that balance as effectively, because they haven\u2019t done the horror side well enough. Something about the direction always ends up more in the fun action adventure feeling, with not enough edge or genuine suspense. Hollywood also seems afraid to have any contrast in the lighting or color correction, and even dark scenes end up looking too soft or too bright (or alternatively too dark to see anything, though that hasn\u2019t been a problem in the Jurassic World movies specifically\u2026 they could use more darkness!), which gives a lighter feeling to the movie, instead of the harder more severe contrasty imagery of dark scenes in Jurassic Park and The Lost World. It gives more of a horror vibe. (It also helps the CGI blend better, which is part of why it holds up to this day)",

The first Jurassic Park puts the big moment at the reveal early on, when the park visitors realize what kind of park it is. There's no tension to cut yet, it establishes the excited atmosphere that they're going into the park with, before the slow descent into realizing the park is not what it seems. There's one small moment later with the brachiosaurus in the tree, but it's very quiet and understated, serving as a small moment to ease off the gas and let the audience get a breath before returning to the danger, which re-enters the picture when the peaceful scene of dinosaurs roaming wild is interrupted by the T. rex hunting.\n\nIn III, in contrast, the movie is pretty much danger danger danger right up until they're on the raft going down the river, and there's a scene of herbivores clustered incredibly tightly against the riverbank while the majestic Jurassic Park theme plays in doubletime. It feels jammed in, unnatural, and does nothing but remind the audience \"oh yeah not all dinosaurs are bad I guess\" while only spending like ten seconds on it.",

            "comment": "I'm gonna be honest, there's a lot of comments here saying they should remake JP and make it more true to the book, or make a show or whatever, but as someone who literally JUST FINISHED reading the book last night, I have to say that JP93 is probably the best adaptation they could have made from it.. Warning, spoilers ahead, but the book has been out for 30+ years now, so I won't be covering it up. \n \nThe characters are pretty bland in the book, the kids are terribly annoying (or at least Lex is, and yes I know she's a little girl that's scared, it doesn't make her any less annoying.) Ellie is barely a character in the book, sure she has the interaction with the raptors at the lodge, but other than that she's either away from what's going on, or sitting by Malcolm's deathbed. Malcolm's talk of chaos theory just goes on and on and on and is summed up so much better in the movie. Hammond is actually a character in the movie, whereas in the book he's just a hard ass old businessman. The movie actually conveys the loss of control and how man can't control nature better than the book imo. Also the aviary scene in JP3 is much better than the aviary section in the book. \n\nAlso, when people refer to wanting it to be more horror like the book, yes, there are some horrible descriptions of Nedry and his intestines, Dr Wu and his intestines, the worker at the start, and the baby in the nursery, and a few more, but to me it was never HORROR HORROR, it was just short quick snippets of action/horror before going BACK to the control room again and then trying to catch the T-Rex, which seems to have a personal vendetta against Dr Grant &amp; the kids and just keeps showing up wherever they are. \n \nTo me, personally, the JP93 movie is superior to the book in practically every way. Except one, which is they turned Gennaro into a stereotypical moustache twirling lawyer, whereas in the books (he still thought about money) but he actually did shit*. Also Muldoon is much cooler in the book. \n\n*I do acknowledge that Spielberg mashed a few scenes etc together and gave some roles other characters had to Ellie to make her a better character in the movie than the book.",

            "comment": "I met David Sandberg four years ago, right after I saw the original Kung Fury. I absolutely loved it and could not stop laughing so I had to meet him.  Now we are finally in Munich shooting. I just had to share with you guys, because I\u2019m so proud of him for making his hilarious vision into a reality. For those of you who want to get into the movies, he\u2019s proof that if you have the vision and you work non-stop and keep hustling away, you can do it. Here\u2019s a photo of the two of us: https://www.reddit.com/user/GovSchwarzenegger/comments/d3p8n7/on_the_set_of_kung_fury_with_kung_fury_himself/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

But he went out there, got fans excited and made something to prove he could do it. It\u2019s a serious success story.\n\nI wish I could hang out but lunch is over.",

The first one liner he makes is after he gets his powers, this same one-liner is what some would call the weakest. \nDavid: \"Knock Knock\"\nNinja: \"Who's there?\"\nDavid: \"... ... ... knock-les\"\nThe power of the one liner came with his powers of kung fu, and through the movie he has to come to term and learn to use these powers properly (actually we dont see that part). You can tell he learned to use his powers extremely well from the first painfully executed one-liner to the arcade fight, where he says \"Game Over\" in a much more one-liner tone. This shows us how he has been able to learn to weild these powers.",

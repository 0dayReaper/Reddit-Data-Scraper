Triple H had been turning him down for years because apparently Dave had told wwe he was doing Guardians, they laughed and thought it'd flop cos it's just a small thing nobody has heard of. And then when it was a smash hit critically and commercially, Trips got jealous, because he's been trying to be an actor too, with far less success. And WWE have their own movies they make too, which never do that well and are straight to dvd type fare.\n\nI'm glad the match is finally happening though. Wrestlemania currently isn't looking too interesting of a card, so it needs all the help it can get. What IS great about it is that the women's match is apparently gonna be the actual main event for the first time ever.",

The match was considered a dream match that never could happen because of the egos of the two stars. \n\nFinally, Michaels agreed to lose to Hogan (spoilers kids) but only if they had a second match where Michaels could win. Hogan initially agreed, but as the day of the match drew closer Hogan took back his word and said they were only going to do the one match, with Hogan as the victor. Nobody was going to tell Hogan no, and the match was extremely hyped up, so Michaels didn't have that much bargaining power.\n\nSo he completely phones in the whole match by over-selling every move. Hogan would throw a punch and Michaels would run to the other side of the ring and leap over the ropes, sprawl onto the floor, then get up and run to the fans and collapse in front of them, 20 feet from the ring. It's a pleasure to watch.\n\nRandom Highlights: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgB1A5EKp8w&amp;t=130s\n\nOne specific example of overselling: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dNgMo6ycQA\n\nContext for the fight: https://youtu.be/_rQlBD9CXqo?t=318\n\nFull match, poor quality. Timestamp at 5:56 to see Michaels act like someone leaving a bar at 2am, and Hogan's reaction when he realizes what Shawn Michaels is doing. \nhttps://youtu.be/EAKvkXzXAUI?t=356\n\n*EDIT: used better videos to demonstrate the overselling. I couldn't find a clean version of the full match. It's Summerslam 2005.",

Strangely enough the videos just kind of make me more impressed with Michaels agility and athleticism, doing all those weird rolls and flips to make it all look cartoonish but he also looks so graceful. Hogan's kind of an egomaniac so it was funny seeing his reactions in this match when he figuresit out.",

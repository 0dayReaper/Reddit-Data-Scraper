    "postText": "Like okay there\u2019s a ton of SAMs on top of the mountain and that\u2019s why we can\u2019t just fly in from above and instead have to do a Death Star Trench run (up to an including the technology failing and having to rely on the force to land the shot perfectly by hand), but why can\u2019t a cruise missile just do all of it?   Cruise missiles care much less about extreme g forces, and more importantly, cruise missiles don\u2019t need to come home after the entire Air Force of That Nation We\u2019re Fighting has been alerted to its existence.\n\nSecondary Question: Why couldn\u2019t all those missiles that blew up the airstrip also blow up the SAMs?  We could send a whole squadron out to watch each other\u2019s backs and defend from the \u201cfifth generation fighters that we can\u2019t say the name of even though we say the names of all the other planes\u201d and take their time landing the bomb right where it should be if all that SAMs were gone.  So much easier.",

You can fly it manual just like any other plane, or using other nav sources like inertial dead reckoning.  Or get even more maneuverability with an F-22, although that's not a Navy jet.  And there are military forms of GPS that are resistant to jamming.  \n\nOr if they're using SAMs to shoot down aircraft-- easier option is just keep sending drones at the thing.  Drones are cheap and eventually they're gonna run out of SAMs.  If even one drone gets through, it can drop a nice fat bomb right on the air vent.",

In that position he would have the title of captain while holding the rank of commander. Commander is the 5th officer rank. \n\nEven smaller ships - such as minesweepers - may have a lieutenant commander as the senior officer. Lt.

Making Captain is \"easy\" (relatively), but going into the Admiral ranks (O-7 to O-10) appears very political. It's all about who you know and who you've pissed-off.\n\nThe guy I worked for had an impressive CV: Naval Academy, Naval aviator, fighter pilot, Vietnam combat action, US Navy Test Pilot School, then an instructor at the Test Pilot School and finally the skipper of the Test Pilot School.\n\nAn aviator's aviator. He had lunch with astronauts and senators.\n\nBut sometime after he made 20 years, he abruptly retired and went to work for a defense contractor. He said the Navy had offered him a desk job at the Pentagon, but he turned it down. I asked if the desk job came with a star (a promotion to O-7, rear admiral). He laughed. He literally laughed. He made it clear that the Navy makes it clear when your career is over. He was never going to make Admiral.\n\nDespite his impressive CV, he accepted it and moved on.\n\nIn the 1992 film *Scent of a Woman*, it's implied that Generals and Admirals are \"earmarked\" at a young age (around Lt. Colonel or Commander) and that it's a very political process. I believe it now.",

Was a 'Mustang' or enlisted sailor who literally went from E-1 to O-6 over a 33 year career.  He LOVED the Navy and talked up joining to me for years....until he was promoted to O-6.  He was a very hard worker, and had a lot of high profile tours of duty - was a high level officer on several ships, including a BB and CVN (being vague as you can literally look it up if I give too much info).  Was surreal as a kid visiting the ships, because there would be photos of my dad all over the place.  \n\nSo he was absolutely qualified to be promoted past O-6, but as you said, it was all political at that level.  He fought to stay in, doing 3 tours as an O-6, including literally being the CO of a base, but he never got O-7 and finally retired when it was super clear he was never getting it and he was completely out of options for new orders.

And the point of Top Gun 2 is that the younger generation is out of touch and they don't get that risks are needed to win. I don't think it ever feels like it's supporting that drones (or the direction we're going in) are GOOD. The film DOES do a good job of showing Mavericks personal life as flawed and he can't play politics, but I think it all just makes him some kind of martyr. He never passes the baton. He just shows why he's better.\n\nStill a fun movie, and I love the original, but I think this one really shows who its primary target audience is.",

Even the top modern pilots haven't flown in enough combat to qualify as an ace and with the advent of drones becoming a superior war machine to a Navy fighter they never will.\n\nMaverick proves the mission is possible and in doing so nearly gets them all killed. These pilots are never going to get the required experience to be as good as Maverick and even now Maverick is barely better than the drones. Its a self indulgent way of admitting that the era of the fighter pilot is closing.  \n\n\nEdit: I think we agree btw. This movie is about giving boomers a confirmation bias hard on in the face of overwhelming evidence that Maverick was being super irresponsible. The fact that it managed to make a good movie while both are true is impressive.",

I mean he's literally called Maverick, which both describes him as a person and also by making it a proper noun places him as The Maverick, the ONLY maverick that the system has room to accommodate. And even then in both movies he's ultimately only successful by tempering his own willfulness and acknowledging that there are SOME valuable lessons in what \"the system\" teaches. \n\nThe younger pilots in the new film are depicted less as \"captured by the system\" or out of touch: It's that circumstances and the attitudes of their superiors have kept them kind of coddled and sheltered. They're pilots that grew up with the US being the ONLY world superpower, who never had to even consider that they'd face a real opponent. Their flaw is that they don't even realize they CAN be better, that they COULD be at all vulnerable, or have gaps in their skills. They're naive.  Admiral Don Draper is the one who's more truly \"out of touch/too rigid.\"\n\nAnd then the film ends with Maverick retiring and relinquishing his role as The Rebel to Goose2. The Establishment are humbled enough to recognize that they do need someone like that, but that that person also needs to be singular and controlled.",

He has a mission to do, and he was willing to accept that the mission might be a suicide mission. Admiral Don Draper spent the whole movie doing two things: making sure that nobody got hurt during training, and minimizing the number of personnel lost to the 6 that flew the mission.\n\nThat is why he set the mission parameters at 4:30 minutes immediately after kicking out Maverick: because they both know that enemy fighters would likely show up around minute 5. The admiral is trying to ensure that the mission would be a success even if pilots on the mission would be intercepted on the way out. To a guy who have been watching the team \"die\" over and over again on the way in without accomplishing the mission, it must feel like the better alternative.\n\nMaverick proved that the mission can done and still have the pilots return, and the admiral promptly put him back in charge. We are still talking about \"reasonable authority figure\" here.",

Or is it more that their mission changed from dog fighting to bombing runs?  Maverick even said this (The only real experience they have is bombing bad guys with smart bombs (or something to that effect)).  They've had no peer like Maverick did, and it's not their fault.  They weren't coddled or sheltered; their mission wasn't for that kind of fighting (dog fighting, low level)\n\n&gt;Their flaw is that they don't even realize they CAN be better, that they COULD be at all vulnerable, or have gaps in their skills. They're naive.\n\nThis I wholeheartedly agree with because of the above.  They've had no near peer conflicts because the world they live in doesn't really allow for it.  F18 drivers aren't going head to head with 5th gen stealth fighters - that's the job of the F35 and F22.",

            "comment": "Airstrips can't move. They are huge and you can see them from space. Most SAM systems are designed to be mobile and that mobility is typically considered crucial to their survival. For example, the Patriot batteries in Ukraine are constantly moving to avoid being targeted, likely several times per day. While you could find them with satellites, by the time you do and follow on with a strike there is a high likelihood that they won't be there anymore, especially if the enemy knows exactly when your satellites are moving overhead.\n\nIn the movie, it is stated that GPS jamming prevents the use of the F-35. This is nonsense, the F-35 has a laser designator built into its EOTS system. It is fully capable of using laser guided weaponry. The real reason is of course is that all F-35's are single seaters so they would not be able to film Tom Cruise in the back seat pretending to fly a real fighter jet.\n\nIt probably goes without saying, but a real attack on Iran's nuclear facilities would not happen as depicted in the movie. The US would use huge numbers of attacking aircraft, most of which would be suppressing the enemy air defenses using SEAD tactics. That involves firing a continuous barrage of HARM missiles which home in on the radiation emitted by the tracking radars on SAM systems. If they turn on their radar to fight back they will probably eat a supersonic HARM missile in short order. B-2's would then by used at high altitude to drop [Massive Ordinance Penetrators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBU-57A/B_MOP) (MOPs), which are super heavy bunker busters, to destroy the facilities that are deep underground.\n\nThe reason they do a Star Wars style trench run is because it looks super exciting on film. Dropping bombs from 50,000 feet and lobbing missiles at extreme range at targets you can't see does not translate very well to the big screen",

Just accept it and enjoy the spectacle.",

    "postText": "I've watched this over 100 times since I was a kid and there's this little random tidbit that I could never figure out. So Marty in 1955 gets stuck in Biff's garage when he leaves after meeting with the 2015 Biff. Marty walkie talkies Doc to come and get him, and Doc responds he can't take the DeLorean out during the day so he'll get him at night and cuts off the communication. \n\nMarty meanwhile tries to get his attention to try to tell him something, or warn him of something but Doc's already cut out. What was he trying to tell him or warn him? Is it as simple as him just not wanting to be stuck in that garage all day? Because anything substantive he'd want to tell or warn Doc Doc himself can probably figure out on his own?",

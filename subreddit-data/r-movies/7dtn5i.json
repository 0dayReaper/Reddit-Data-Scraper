The ban on superheros is never lifted and his family is hunted down one by one and killed in various ways that their powers couldnt save them until Jack Jack is the only one left.\n\nHe sharpens his skills and goes after the government who killed his family. The movie becomes a bloody revenge story with JJ raging against his opponents and killing them in merciless ways.\n\nThe story is all dark and violent. A far cry from the family friendly origins of the first film.",

Nelson) at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell) and Dash (voice of Huck Milner) to navigate the day-to-day heroics of \u201cnormal\u201d life. It\u2019s a tough transistion for everyone, made tougher by the fact that the family is still unaware of baby Jack-Jack\u2019s emerging superpowers. When a new villain hatches a brilliant and dangerous plot, the family and Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) must find a way to work together again\u2014which is easier said than done, even when they\u2019re all Incredible.\n \nDirected by Brad Bird (\u201cIron Giant,\u201d \u201cThe Incredibles\u201d) and produced by John Walker (\u201cThe Incredibles\u201d) and Nicole Grindle (\u201cSanjay\u2019s Super Team\u201d short, \u201cToy Story 3\u201d associate producer), \u201cIncredibles 2\u201d busts into theaters on June 15, 2018.\u201d",

But still, there was no clearly stated explanation for how his powers developed. All we know is that they didn't think he had powers at first.\n\nAlso, the kid's names are connected with their powers. I don't need to explain Dash. Violet, like a shrinking violet, was a shy girl that hides behind her own long hair, and also could become invisible and put up force fields around her self. And then you have this Jack of All Trades, Jack Jack, who seems like he could still develop in all kinds of directions.",

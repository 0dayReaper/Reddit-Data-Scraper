Spoiler: &gt;!When the group is trying to comfort Miles over his Uncle\u2019s death, Spider-Ham says \u201cIn this job, you can\u2019t always save everyone.\u201d!&lt;\n\nIt\u2019s probably his only serious line in the whole movie.  Contrast that with his comedic relief throughout the movie and the audience truly feels for him and understands that there is more depth to him.  The delivery of that line was one of the many touching moments in this movie for me.",

A comic relief character needs to be comical and relieving, but some times neither of those feelings is appropriate. Sometimes you need to bum your audience out, and a \"comic relief\" character is excellent for that, because when even the literal cartoon character is sharing in someone's pain, you as an audience member just *have* to feel that pain too.",

Like, the kind of laughter that probably pisses people off because it just seems excessive and the thing being laughed at can't possibly by *that* funny but is 100% genuine. Just, somehow the *audacity* of actually going there pushed me right off the deep end.",

Love the creators had for the end product, love they had for the source material, love they had for the fans, love they had for the original creators. Every frame just screamed to me \"we care.\" \n\nI'm so burnt out on movies that are just products, you know? Films that were thrown together for the sole purpose of making more than they spend, or just to further the story of the cinematic universe. I can't remember the last time I came out of a theater thinking I had seen a work of passion. I *felt* loved as I left. I don't know even know that much about Spider-Man - I'd seen the Raimi movies and the first Garfield film, maybe played a couple video games over the years, but I'd never heard of The Prowler or Spider-Man Noire or Peni Parker or Kingpin's family or a Green Goblin that's basically a small kaiju. And still, I felt like this movie was made for me to enjoy. I can only imagine how long-time Spider-Man fans felt watching it. It must have been cathartic.",

And the matrix is still running, it's just that humans are now allowed to leave it by will after the events of the trilogy.\n\nSo Neo could be reborn, or it could be that Neo's consciousness was uploaded into the matrix or some shit and he exists without a body, or he could exist in flashbacks. Or some other scifi fantasy bullshit. It's a movie. They'll find a way.\n\nTrinity is another story. Not sure how they'll bring her back. Maybe she was saved somehow. Or, of course, flashbacks.",

You should be dead, but apparently you weren't ready for that, either.\n\nIt is still vague but basically when he met the Architect at the Source he unlocks full admin permissions and his plug enables him to wirelessly access the other machines because they are all connected to the source too.\n\nNot to mention Neo was part machine.

Originally after too many humans reject the Matrix the One is supposed to reach the Source where the Architect is and he explains what happens and the One sacrifices himself for the good of all mankind by sacrificing himself \"system rebooting\".\n\nThe Matrix needs to operate at 100% efficiency but there will always be some of humanity that will reject the Matrix which the Oracle was able to get at 99%, but 1% will always reject. In order to deal with that the Machine created The One program who selects 23 humans, 16 Females and 7 males who will be the founders of new Zion where the remaining 1% of all humans who will never accept the Matrix will go until they grow too big and threaten the stability of the Matrix where the One will then return back to the source \\(The Architect and going to the right door will restart the Matrix and restart Zion however he picked the left door to save Trinity\\). This would be the 6th Zion time by the time of Neo's time.](https://youtu.be/cHZl2naX1Xk?t=54)  Part 2 of the [Architect speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8EE5JxSGQ).\n\nThe Oracle tired of the Architect's plan of just killing Zion each time made it so that the next One would fall in love with Trinity and instead of choosing Humanity like all previous ones would choose love (Trinity) instead which the previous Ones did not have that choice. This caused the end of the cycle and gave humanity a way out of the Matrix without the killing.  The end of Matrix Revolutions has the oracle and architect talking about her plan that made Neo pick love over the continuation of the [prime program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnT3lZ11ig) and letting all humans who want to be free from the Matrix out if they want out.",

Something happens, the Matrix is restored from a backup, but changed and Neo and Co. must face the new challenge. Or maybe copies of Neo and Trin exist in the Matrix and they have to do something to be restored to their physical bodies.",

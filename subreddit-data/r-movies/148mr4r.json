    "postText": "I grew up with Home Alone 1&amp;2 they are two childhood Christmas movies that I hold dearly to my heart. I refuse to watch Home Alone 3 4 and 5 because of how much I hate this movie. this movie was just a cash grab by Disney. the kid Max Mercher is an insufferable asshole, the way he's left Home Alone makes no sense, I don't feel bad for him at all. and the \"Burglars\" are not Burglars they're an innocent couple who are about to lose their home. and Max is torturing them because he thinks they're trying to kidnap him. the traps in this movie are not funny they're just mean spirited and cruel. unlike Harry and Marv who truly deserved it because they were bad people and legit criminals, Jeff and Pam Mackenzie did not deserve to be subjected to Max's traps and I just felt sorry for them. the ending is really bad the references to the original were just forced. this movie has officially dethroned Speed 2 Cruise Control as my number 1. worst sequel i've ever seen. Fuck this movie just watch the first 2 home alone movies,  don't watch this movie. save your time and money for better movies than this. this movie took a huge shit on my childhood. John Hughes is rolling in his grave.",

I wish that was the world we were living in right now. that way those 2 films that I grew up with won't have to suffer through shitty sequels that only exist just for a cash grab and meant to treat the audiences like dumbasses.",

Making the burglars a sympathetic couple with financial issues was the worst writing decision I have ever seen. It ruins the traps because I\u2019m not laughing, but cringing inside at the pain inflicted on the characters. It has no reason to exist and the meta-joke about remaking the classics that are never as good as the original is ironic.",

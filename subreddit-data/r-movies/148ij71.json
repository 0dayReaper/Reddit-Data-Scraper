Andy looked like that in the first Toy Story, the humans in Wall-E followed a similar design language, same for UP, Ratatouille, Brave etc. Really only The Incredibles altered the style, but even then, \"bubbly\" is still the best descriptor. I totally understand getting bored with it - but Pixar has made the style a trademark of their films and I doubt they'll dramatically change it any time soon.",

It felt like it wanted to be a Ghibli movie but couldn\u2019t achieve that level of calm that Ghibli movies get. It never sat with itself in silence and beauty and contemplation like Ghibli films. I felt like I was watching a Vespa ad at points. I did not connect to any of the protagonists. With some tweaking it could\u2019ve been really good, but I just was thoroughly unimpressed with it. It\u2019s one of the most forgettable Pixar films to me. Also I thought the characters were pretty ugly",

I think one of the under-discussed things about the newest Pixar movies is that they really have not been focusing much at all on making the movies funny, despite humor being incredibly important to kids movies. \n\nMario starred Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan Michael Key, Seth Rogen and Anya Taylor Joy. It also had Fred Armisen in a supporting role. All but one of those actors got famous doing comedy. In comparison, Elemental has Joe Pera in a supporting role. That\u2019s it. This studio got big with movies that featured comedians in major, beloved roles. Then at some point they decided they were above it, and they\u2019ve been struggling since then. As it turns out, having funny people make funny movies for kids actually is a pretty good formula. Having unknown actors make serious fables for children feels like eating vegetables in comparison.",

Additions to the voice cast include: Jameela Jamil and Brad Garrett join previously announced America Ferrera and Yonas Kibreab in the intergalactic misadventure that is scheduled to take off next spring\u2014March 1, 2024.\n \n&gt;For centuries, people have called out to the universe looking for answers\u2014in Disney and Pixar\u2019s all-new movie \u201cElio,\u201d the universe calls back! The original feature film introduces Elio, an underdog with an active imagination who finds himself inadvertently beamed up to the Communiverse, an interplanetary organization with representatives from galaxies far and wide. Mistakenly identified as Earth\u2019s ambassador to the rest of the universe, and completely unprepared for that kind of pressure, Elio must form new bonds with eccentric alien lifeforms, survive a series of formidable trials and somehow discover who he is truly meant to be. \n \n&gt;Directed by Adrian Molina (screenwriter and co-director of \u201cCoco\u201d) and produced by Mary Alice Drumm (associate producer of \u201cCoco\u201d), the film features the voices of America Ferrera as Elio\u2019s mom, Olga; Jameela Jamil as Ambassador Questa; Brad Garrett as Ambassador Grigon; and Yonas Kibreab as the title character. \u201cElio\u201d releases in theaters March 1, 2024.",

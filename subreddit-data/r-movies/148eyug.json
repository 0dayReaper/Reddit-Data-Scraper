McQuarrie has said he's done after Dead Reckoning, and Cruise is the type who would want to go out on a high note (plus I think he loves the crew that's been making the last few movies). It seems clear that the studio will want to keep the IP rolling, but it will either be a reboot with Hunt or a new IMF team with a few mentions of the old team. \n\nI'd prefer the latter. No pointless cameos, although Benji coming back as the experienced mentor to a brash youngish new lead agent could be cool. Especially if he got to be the badass grizzled vet.",

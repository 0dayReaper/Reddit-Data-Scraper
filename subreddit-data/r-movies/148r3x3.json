    "postText": "So last week I was watching Sing 2 when my family had it on and never noticed how beautiful the last number is with Scarlett and Bono. The way it just builds up and up with the audience going with it, just so tear inducing. Yeah these movies get dogged on for basically being filler with no substance but that one particular scene showed that illumination is capable of producing great content like that.",

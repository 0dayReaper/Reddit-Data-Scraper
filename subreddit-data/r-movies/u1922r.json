As it should be.\n\nBetween people like him and Keanu Reeves, it makes you realize this god complex so many Hollywood people get is pretty much by choice, and not simply a symptom of the industry like a lot of people try to pretend.",

It really excels at making you feel the discomfort the main characters are feeling at any time \nThe visions of the one girl feels a little goofy at times but the effects hold up so I\u2019ll give it a pass.",

Like the ghost rider movie isn't great in the grand scheme of things, but it was an early foray into a more horror esque comic book movie and IMO Cage jumped into that vibe fully. Or Mandy, which is very off the way and a non-stereotypical and Cage engaged 100% in the role.\n\nHis new movie seems up that alley. It's a little odd, tongue in cheek, etc.",

And Drive Angry.  More recent stuff, I guess is my point.\n\nAnd he's really not that over-the-top. I mean, Drive Angry itself was a bit, and Cage's supposed insistence in press that he drink from the guys skull at the end was, but the performance itself wasn't.\n\nThere's an older interview where he breaks down a crazy character from an old movie, and he goes \"well I drew inspiration from classic German expressionism like Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" and it's like, oh. He's not a madman who was captured and released on set. He's an artsy guy who chose to do something different. And I think the movies he tends to do are still a bit different. Kinda like how your favorite band \"sold out\" by growing up, and they're a little mellower and cleaner but there's uniqueness still.\n\nBut to your point, I think giving that answer is a bit eccentric, if in a totally different vein than we'd expect.",

He's the only actor since Marlon Brando that's actually done anything new with the art of acting; he's successfully taken us away from an obsession with naturalism into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadours. If I could erase his bottom half bad movies, and only keep his top half movies, he would blow everyone else out of the water. He's put a little too much water in his beer, but he is still one of the great actors of our time. And working with him was an absolute pleasure. In fact, one of my favorite scenes I've ever done is the last scene in LORD OF WAR.",

We didn\u2019t bother you but you were a massively entitled cunt who yelled and treated the waitstaff like shit and when one of my party politely suggested you calm down, you got really aggressive and threatening (in a chubby way. Like a boozy panda.) So my question is this; why did Harry seem so cool, while you were such a massive throbbing bellend?\u201d",

It's a brutal pace and yet filled with incredible boredom.\n\nNick was kind, thoughtful, treated them all with respect, answering questions he'd already heard 200 times as if they were brand new. His enthusiasm never waned over two days. It was impressive. \n\nI was expecting something totally different, and was very pleasantly surprised.",

He introduced himself \u201cHi, I\u2019m Nick\u201d to every single crew member on the first day. He was always extremely professional. He knew every line in the scene and always gave a good performance. There were a few times when his scene partner would forget a line and before the script supervisor could say the line out loud, Nick had already reminded them of their line and then repeated his last line to give the scene partner another chance. A prepared professional through and through.\n\nOn the last week we had a new crew member show up to help with some bigger set ups that we were doing, a new kid whose job was to be another set of hands to help carry gear. Nick noticed the kid and walked up to him \u201cI haven\u2019t met you yet. My name is Nick, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\nPeople can say whatever they want about his acting, his movie choices, his crazy antics, or whatever. None of that matters to me, because what I will always remember about Nicolas Cage is that he is an insanely professional and courteous guy to work with!",

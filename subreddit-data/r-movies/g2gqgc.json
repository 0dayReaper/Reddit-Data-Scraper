In addition to all the jumps they did in Abu Dhabi, they constructed the largest skydiving fan ever so they could practice camera moves and spent about six months doing that in northern England.

At the start of the shot when they both fall out of the plane he pulls from infinity to close focus and back out again. He focus pulled the whole sequence with just that thing in his hand\n\nHe also had almost no idea of how it was framed until afterwards. He had a small circle piece of glass over his eye attached to his helmet that we tried to line up to what the lens sees before each jump, as a make shift vf",

Its a transparent metal ring in front of their eye that has some kind of treatment that gives a rudimentary cross-hair-ish looking thing (hard to describe - i'll try to get a picture later).   \n\nThe ring sight - coupled with YEARS of experience gets you most of the way there.  A wider lense is also a big help - and based on how close tom was in those shots - its reasonably wide.   \n\nSince we obviously cannot change camera settings while in freefall, all of the lens and camera settings needs to be set up before the jump - so there is some educated guessing that needs to happen before hand.  \n\nLastly - a huge part of being a freefall photographer, is the need to be steady - to know where you need to be without whipping your head around.  To manage your fall rate, and to keep YOUR body out of the shot.  \n\nSource:  Freefall photographer for over a decade.  [And an old photo I shot](https://i.imgur.com/djWPOgD.jpg)",

In the stone ages - before gopros, we all had side mount video cameras.  You needed custom molded boxes on the side of your helmet to minimize snag hazards (to keep the sharp edges of the camera or mount from hanging up your risers or the lines of your canopy).  \n\nWe also had helmet cut-away systems so if it did get hung up, you could ditch your helmet.  \n\nOnce you started getting serious in photography, you upgrade to a bigger platform.  More room for maybe a still camera AND a video camera.  [This](http://www.chutingstar.com/bonehead-flat-top-pro-2) is probably the same helmet the OP camera man used.  You have to start being careful when you load up your helmet.  That is a LOT of weight, and you are one rough opening away from permanent damage.  Some people will open their parachute and immediately put their fists under their chins to be shock absorbers if you have a hard opening.  \n\nYou probably noticed the cameraman had little wings under his arms.  Those are used to give you more range in freefall speed.  \n\nWe also can't control cameras with our hands.  If you are shooting stills, we have bite, blow, or tongue switches to take pictures.  You frame your shot, and well - bite, blow, or push with your tongue.  \n\n**Work**:\nAs you may have guessed - there can be a range of jobs for camera work. Most get their start filming people doing tandems.  You can film for teams.  Once you get a little more experience and \"known\" - you might start filming big formation skydives.  You might like to specialize is a particular discipline...but most serious guys can do most everything (formations, teams, tandems, wingsuiting, etc).  \n\nWhen you are at the higher levels, organizers start seeking you out to do work for them.  They will pay your travel, expenses, your jumps, and even pay you a day rate.  You can sell your pictures to people who want...well...their pictures.  \n\n**Stories**: \nThat will come in another reply :)",

I guess I'm not a Tom Cruise fan personally, but damn, did he kill that role.    \nThe way his character's demeanor and physical acuity and intensity change from day to day is really well executed. \n\n And to add to that, they filmed that movie like \"Ground Hogs Day.\"  So at each given set, he had to play \"Newbie Marketing Soldier,\" \"Getting the hang of it soldier,\" and \"Bad ass death machine soldier\" each day.\n\nGreat film.  I'm in love with Emily Blunt's upper arms.",

It's a fact - they do an amazing job. And you have a lot more red cells than you actually need at any given time. A lot more.\n\nThe fact that you want to exhale after having held your breath for a few minutes is caused by a reflex to carbon dioxide, not a lack of oxygen. Your body's got plenty of oxygen to keep going... so all you have to do is overcome the CO2 reflex. And that's something you can learn - free divers (people who dive without tanks or breathing apparatuses) do it all the time.\n\nOf course, that reflex exists to keep you alive... so ignoring it is not exactly safe... it's also how a lot of free divers die, unfortunately...",

While there's more trickery at work in MI (TC is not actually quite as suicidal or in the same level of a young JC) there are still big stunt piece that make me unconsciously go \"wait, how did they do that?\".\n\nThe helicopter solo flying stunt in Fallout is to me even more impressive than the Halo jump. The insane amount of training, skill and risk in that stunt is off the chart. There have been actors doing their own car stunts or even motorcycle stunts but flying a helicopter solo and doing crazy maneuvers? That's not going to be top anytime soon.\n\nI firmly believe if there's a way to film a stunt in low Earth orbit in the next half-decade, MI will do it first (and Fast and Furious will have a CGI scene of cars racing in space for *reasons*).",

                    "comment": "If I remember correctly from a podcast interview with the director, one of the reasons they had to reshoot so much is because the camera guy didn't have something setup on the camera correctly. When they would play the footage back they'd be like, \"Tom, I know it's difficult, but we need you exactly 'so and so' distance away from the camera when you get close,\" and Tom was like, \"I am.\" They kept trying to correct him and Tom was like, \"Look, if you tell me to stop a certain distance away from the camera, that's where I'm stopping.\" Sure enough, after checking the camera equipment, it was the equipment that was off, not Tom. Apparently, even while skydiving, Tom Cruise knows where his mark is haha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Podcast episode here for anyone interested. \n\n [http://www.theqandapodcast.com/2018/07/mission-impossible-fallout-q.html](http://www.theqandapodcast.com/2018/07/mission-impossible-fallout-q.html)",

From Business Insider:\n\nAccording to Hewitt, before Cruise's injury, the HALO jump was not going to be a true 25,000-foot jump. Because the production was working with the UK's Royal Air Force, it was agreed that the movie would use the RAF plane to do the stunt. But the RAF would fly them to only 12,000 feet.\n\n\"Tom didn't want to fake it \u2014 he wanted to do it for real at 25,000 feet,\" Hewitt said. \"But the producers said they weren't going to another country. It really looked like we were going to fake it with the RAF.\"\n\nBut because of Cruise\u2019s injury, the movie missed its scheduled jump with the RAF. That opened the door for the production to end in Abu Dhabi shooting the HALO scene at 25,000 feet.\n\n\"If Tom didn't break his ankle, we would have ended up faking it, which nobody wanted,\" Hewitt said.",

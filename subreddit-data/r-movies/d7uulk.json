But, My area's accent drops \"T\"s from the middle of some words in what's called a glottal stop (though not as pronounced as it is in cockney). \n\nSo in speech the T always gets dropped, unless I'm pronouncing it very firmly (like when a 4 year old is getting into trouble)",

The game essentially allows player to run their own tv station and to buy/create their own tv shows/movies. The quote from this movie appears once in a while (quote from godfather 2 also appears, quite a lot of meta movie references) when a new day begins, and I was like, this quote is badass, so I checked out the movie - it was very fun.",

Many of the movies you listed in your other comment could - I'd say the Cornetto Trilogy is probably closest at this point.\n\nWhere the blockbuster thing comes in is that now they remake things on such a short (less than 10 years) cycle because the money is guaranteed so no one gets pissy when it's remade because no one's had the time to let it marinate and really, viscerally, identify with it like we did with things like Princess Bride.",

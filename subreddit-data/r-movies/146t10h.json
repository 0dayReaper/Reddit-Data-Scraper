I remember something like participants only wearing underwear and masks and something like that would be perfect. I am not looking for scenes of a sterile working environment, but rather something semi professional party-ish. \n\nIs here anyone who can me with that? :) \n\nThanks in advance",

Here are a few examples:  \n\"Scarface\" (1983): In this classic crime film directed by Brian De Palma, there is a scene where Tony Montana (played by Al Pacino) and his associates are seen repackaging cocaine in a luxurious mansion.  \n\"Blow\" (2001): Based on a true story, this film follows the rise and fall of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp), a notorious drug trafficker. There are multiple scenes throughout the movie that show the process of repackaging cocaine.  \n\"American Gangster\" (2007): In this crime drama directed by Ridley Scott, there are scenes where Frank Lucas (played by Denzel Washington) and his team are shown packaging and distributing heroin.",

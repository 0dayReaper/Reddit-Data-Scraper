    "postText": "Hey everyone , I am a big fan of seals and sea lions and  I'd like to see more movies featuring them. So far I have seen Andre and The Secret of Roan Inish. I had seen Andre at the theater as a kid in the '90's so it was very nostalgic for me. The Secret of Roan Inish (though also from the '90's) was new to me. I loved the story, the seals, and the setting in Ireland. Could anyone recommend some other movies of any style or era with seals or Sea lions in them? Any suggestions would be appreciated.",

It wasn\u2019t a very good film, but it had seals and baby seals and was cute.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MKP1quW-Blk\n\nHuh, found the whole film! It\u2019s been decades since I saw it, I didn\u2019t know it was anime. Maybe I\u2019ll rewatch it tonight. \n\n\nThe better one for you to watch would be the recent \u2018Song of the Sea\u2019, which is about selkies and set in Ireland. Exactly what you\u2019re looking for.",

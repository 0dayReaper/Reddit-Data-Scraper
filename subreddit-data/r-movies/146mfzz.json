    "postText": "Let My Love Open The Door by Pete Townshend is a very overplayed song that you normally hear at the end of comedies. That song was at the end of Look Who's Talking, Mr. Deeds, Along Came Polly and The Adam Project. There probably has been a few other movies that song was in because that I find to be an overplayed song outside of anything by AC/DC. What's a very overplayed song in TV and movies?",

The song is becoming a parody at this point.",

That song has no business being played just *randomly whenever*. Bad to the Bone is a song that *only* works when something badass is starting to happen. Can\u2019t just be going about your day and that song comes on and it makes things more badass, no. Terminator used it perfectly. You should only play Bad to the Bone when you\u2019re naked, walking into a biker bar, and looking to forcibly take someone\u2019s clothes and motorcycle. That\u2019s how that song *works.* I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that was what George Thorogood was doing when he first wrote it. Just naked with a guitar, walking into a biker bar to fight, playing that iconic opening riff. That\u2019s the point of that song.\n\nYou how *not* to use that song? Letting the radio play it at 1:46PM between the Genesis song I Can\u2019t Dance and Billy Joel\u2019s Allentown.",

It\u2019s one of their best songs, in my opinion. It even has its own music video directed by George Romero. The thing is, Wes Craven (I think) didn\u2019t like the song, so he picked Red Right Hand instead.\n\nWe were *this close* to a \u201cnew\u201d Misfits song being used in a blockbuster film franchise, which would have been cool. We ended up getting Nick Cave, though, which is also cool, just differently.",

They didn\u2019t mix well. Don\u2019t need to hear Koji Kondo between Beastie Boys and ELO, that doesn\u2019t make any sense together cohesively.\n\nEdited to add: I love Jack Black and his music, and he was one of the highlights of the film for sure, but that Peaches song they put in the movie *twice* isn\u2019t *nearly* as good as it thinks it is.",

Amazing performances, outstanding visuals and cinematography, great score, an astonishing sense of wonder throughout the movie and it absolutely aged well in today's world. It's a real shame that it underperformed at the box office and that critics were so harsh on the movie. The entire movie is 10/10 excellent.",

Halle did a great job, she's the only Disney LA princess who can actually sing. Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was easily the best part of the movie. The movie isn't as good as the animated original but I would put it as the third best Disney LA remake. (behind The Jungle Book and Cinderella)",

It's going to be silly, probably generic in its plot and filled with references.  But in the end it's a fun movie to watch with the family. Or if you like Mario in general.",

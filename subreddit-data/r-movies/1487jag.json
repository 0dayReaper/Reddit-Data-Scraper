    "postText": "So missing came out earlier this year and I know it came out very early, but I would love to see it. Get some recognition next year at the Academy Awards. It doesn\u2019t have to win, but there are definitely some categories. I think would be awesome if we got nominated for: \n\n-Storm Reid for Best Actress \n\n-Joaquim de Almeida for Supporting Actor \n\n-Screenplay\n\n-Production design\n\nDo you think this movie will get any nominations? Would you like to see it get nominations? \n\n(Was gonna post this on the Oscars sub Reddit But somehow that subreddit is now private)",

            "comment": "Unfortunately Missing is too small, too genre-y (the Academy doesn't generally respond to thrillers) and not acclaimed enough to get on the Academy's radar. It also came out really early in the year and there are a lot of heavy hitters from big names with major stars (some of which already have international critical support coming out of Cannes) coming out in the coming weeks and months. I haven't seen Missing so I can't speak for its quality but it doesn't have a \"pedigree\" and unlike a film like Past Lives for example, it also doesn't have overwhelming critical praise. Smaller films get in largely because of critics championing them but the critics already have a couple indie darlings on their radar instead. \n\nThe Oscar race sub is temporarily locked to protest Reddit's 3rd party app rule changes.",

It's shocking how much effort he put into creating an exciting, adventurous score that still feels distinct from other franchise; and then to see just how shoddily put together the rest of the movie is.",

The first time I watched it I had to start it over again a few times in a row because it was so unexpected and hilarious. \n\nWarning it contains highly offensive language especially in 2023 but I can't recommend enough!\n\n[https://youtu.be/2Nmh6NwfH-c](https://youtu.be/2Nmh6NwfH-c)",

    "postText": "Watching Funny People there's a montage in the middle where you see him playing and it got me thinking. Does AS work a basketball into every film, even the ones not related to sports? The obvious sports ones IIRC he touches a basketball in each one, including Longest Yard, Hustle, and Uncut Gems. After watching that scene in Funny People it just got me thinking if he worked it into all of them",

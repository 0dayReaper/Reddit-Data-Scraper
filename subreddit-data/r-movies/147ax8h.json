    "postText": "Just finished this movie. Went in thinking it would be jut some romcom, but is way more than that. The movie wields the cringe masterfully, and I had to pause a few times at first. It really does a good job of putting the viewer in the characters' perspectives. As the story moves along it becomes something else though.\n\nThere is a powerful message here that you just don't see very often. The movie delivers it in a way that is so comforting, so sincerely that it is disarming. I think it is a good watch for anyone feeling a little down and alone.",

It's normal, that's what most media do to move the plot along.\n\nIn this movie there is very little of that. The whole community comes together to help him and is incredibly understanding from the start. Tbh I spent the whole movie waiting to see if anyone was going to ridicule him or something like that. I thought the bowling scene was going to be it when the other guys arrived.\n\nIn the end I was glad none of that happens. I was happy to see everyone was just having a good time. Over the course of the movie I forgot about the cringe of the whole deal and became interested in learning more about Lars' state of mind and how he became like that. I wanted to see him get better, just like everyone around him did in the movie.\n\nI think that's the magic of it. Putting the viewer in a place of understanding, of tolerance and kindness.",

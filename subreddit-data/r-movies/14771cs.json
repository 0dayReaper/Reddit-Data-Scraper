    "postText": "I just finished it and it's really good. Lots of different story lines going on from the protagonists interaction with various countries and companies to his family life. It takes place mostly in Russia and also presents a harrowing look at their society at least as it existed in the 80's. Not sure how different it is now 40 years later but what's presented is very reminiscent of 1984 and Big Brother.",

Although before the showing, I was stood outside having a smoke and he came up to me asking (in broken English) for a light.\n\nTetris: From Russia With Love was a BBC documentary that was the go-to for many on the topic. The Gaming Historian made a youtube video a while back that lifted much of the footage and info from the doc itself.\n\nEdit: On the same day I got to see a Q&amp;A with Keita Takahashi who created the Katamari games too.",

Check out some YouTube videos though, you can find them by googling interviews with people who worked there and what they thought about the film, one of them said when it releases on Digital he'll be doing a commentary about what really happened there. \n\nThere's also a book about really happened so not sure what to believe but as a film I thought it was great.\n\nYou're welcome, glad you liked it.",

Into the Spider Verse is one of my favorite movies of all time and I felt Across the Spider Verse was just everything I loved about the first film done better. From the amazing visuals and animation to the writing, voice acting, the score and soundtrack, my god it was so amazing. I have not been able to stop thinking about it since I\u2019ve seen it and I just cannot wait for Beyond the Spider Verse.",

Why is she so dangerous?  Well don't worry because they will use revolutionary camera technology to give us a cool slow motion demonstration!\n\nThe martial arts choreography was pretty good for Reeves and Fishburne as well.  What a great fight scene! I shared the excitement when Mouse ran to the break room and announced, \"Morpheus is fightin' Neo!\"\n\nAnd the shootouts at the government building, how epic, I mean c'mon.  \"Sir please remove any metallic objects, keys, cell phone....HOLY SHIT!\" \\*gets machine gunned to death\\*\n\nThen you left the theater trying to figure out how you knew you weren't in The Matrix.",

Ugh it made me so sad and now I'm thinking about it again.\n\nAnother more recent release I seen in the theatre was Don't Worry Darling.

It was truly amazing and I had to watch it again.",

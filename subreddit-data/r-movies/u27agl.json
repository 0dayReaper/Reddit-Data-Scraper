It just goes from 60-70 bpm, immediately to 220-240. No ramp-up or warning. You can feel it in your throat, and it makes your trachea feel like it's burning. And the ends of your extremities (fingertips, tips of toes, nose, etc) feel like they have lidocaine in them, that slightly swollen, numb feeling. It lasts anywhere from 1 minute to several hours. Fucking shitty thing to deal with.",

The cues in the theater are broken so when its over I have to go to the booth to turn the projector off and turn the lights on. When I do this I look down into the theater and see him and his family jump out of their seats, throw their arms in the air, hug and kiss each other, and he swings his little girl around. Its an incredibly sweet family moment and I was a creep who accidentally spied on it. They seemed really happy.",

    "postText": " Roland Emmerich's debut film is slickly produced for a first time director, even if there's the inherent roughness you expect. \n\nIn the future of  1997, Billy Hayes (Richy Muller) returns to Earth from the weather  control and research station Florida Arklab, a joint European and  American project, where he details the events involving fellow astronaut  Max Marek (Franz Buchrieser) and the two's uncovering of insidious  plans involving the station.  \n\n\nThe Noah's Ark Principle was the  first film to be produced and directed by Roland Emmerich who'd later  achieve greater success in America outside his homeland of West Germany.  Emmerich was inspired to make an effects heavy science-fiction film  following his graduation from the German Film and Television Academy due  to the continued success of Star Wars and other effects heavy American  blockbusters which Emmerich studied as part of his degree requirement.  Securing funding from noted producer Bernd Eichinger, Solaris-Film, and  the Academy itself, Emmerich produced the film for around 1 million  Deutsche Marks using an old factory as a studio and completing the  special effects at Bavaria Studios in Munich. Upon release the film  received some praise for its impressive effects work for such a low  budget production, but was only a modest success due to only modest  distribution as the film never saw release in the United States due in  no small part to its portrayal of the United States. As this is  effectively a student film it's important to view it in perspective, and  as a showcase of Emmerich's handling of effects heavy work you can  definitely see it here.  \n\n\nOn a technical level The Noah's Ark  Principle does a nice job of establishing its central Florida Arklab  space station which is impressively designed and realized especially in  comparison to certain other effects heavy works from around the same  time. The movie is considerably more slow paced in comparison to many  effects heavy films from around the same time and is more of a chamber  drama for most of its runtime than a proper thriller or sci-fi film with  most of the shady stuff involving shadowy political forces being pretty  apparent from the getgo. While Emmerich hasn't quite cemented his style  here, you can see shades of the Emmerich we'd come to know from the  shadowy government conspiracy (which no joke, is revealed through a  program file that has the acronym \"INVASION\"), the quirky scientist  outsider protagonist (though not as over the top as his 90s takes on  it), or the estranged couple drama that would be part and parcel to many  of his disaster films. While I can't say the movie kept me hooked, I  can say it did showcase an impressive amount of polish and potential for  Emmerich's handling of this level of effects heavy work.  \n\n\nThe  Noah's Ark Principle is best viewed as more of a technical proof of  concept rather than a full movie in and of its own right and for a first  time film from a Germanic filmmaker that didn't have major studio  resources at his beck-and-call, Emmerich does showcase a solid display  of talent. It's a shame the film isn't more readily available because it  probably deserves a higher end transfer if only for the technical craft  involved even if it's more a historical curiosity than anything that  demands a viewing.",

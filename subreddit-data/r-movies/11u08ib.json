Someone I can be similar to, but also aspiring to be.\n\n\"Couple weeks from now, you're gonna be in some district somewhere with 11 or 12 uniforms looking to you for everything. And some of them are gonna be good police. Some of them are gonna be young and stupid. A few are gonna be pieces of shit. But all of them will take their cue from you.\n\nYou show loyalty, they learn loyalty. You show them it's about the work, it'll be about the work. You show them some other kinda game, then that's the game they'll play.\n\nI came on in the Eastern, and there was a piece-of-shit lieutenant hoping to be a captain, piece-of-shit sergeants hoping to be lieutenants. Pretty soon we had piece-of-shit patrolmen trying to figure the job for themselves. And some of what happens then is hard as hell to live down. Comes a day you're gonna have to decide whether it's about you or about the work.\"\n\nI just haven't seen any character describing leadership in such a distinct way.",

Both actors knew how to show that their characters knew how to play \"the games\" of what they were involved with. I don't want to say Bosch is underrated, but I do think it flew under the radar for a lot of people as just another police procedural. Genuinely one of my favorite shows of the past 10 years or so.",

One time at Emerald City Comic Con, I made a point of getting away from my booth to meet Lance.\n\nI was first in line and weirdly I was nervous to meet him which is strange since I commonly meet a lot of industry people. Anyway, he shows up and I say \"You are the coolest fucking actor ever\" then I felt dumb for saying Fuck and apologized.\n\nBut he brought himself right down to my level and very nicely said that he just geeked out over meeting Michael Biehn (who was also at that con).\n\nAmidst all these Lance Reddick articles, I was THIS article: https://twitter.com/JimJarmuschHair/status/1636818774279213057 which shows him having a similar geek experience over Keanu Reeve's girlfriend and also using something to the effect of \"Cool as fuck\" so that made me better after all these years too.\n\nAnyway, in board games I'm knowning for being the designer of the Drinking Quest series and he signed this for me and it's just been the greatest: https://twitter.com/DrinkingQuest/status/1156257059744227328\n\nThis was nine years ago and I was still fairly new to game design and publishing at the time so to get a boost like this early one was really nice to have.\n\nTL;DR I awkwardly geeked out, Lance was a gentleman about it",

And I figure, well he's about to be 93 so if I don't go now I'll never get another chance to see him. And while I've watched most of star trek overall, I've never seen movies 3-6, so I'll probably watch those this week or next. And maybe rewatch some tos, and maybe read Shatner's newest biography too.",

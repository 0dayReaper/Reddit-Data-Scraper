    "postText": "Top Gun 2 was no doubt an amazing sequel. Probably the best executed sequel in recent memory and the flying and in-cockpit scenes were great as this was originally what they wanted to do with the original film but the camera quality at the time wasn't there. \n\nWhat I noticed though, is that Top Gun 1 seemed to have more flying scenes as part of the overall narrative while Top Gun 2 used the flying scenes as specific sequences in the overall narrative.\n\nPersonally, while the real cockpit sequences in TG2 were a cinematic achievement, I actually preferred TG1's cockpit scenes as they felt more \"claustrophobic\" like I was actually *in* the cockpit with the pilots.",

            "comment": "I think the overall narrative was just so much meatier and had much more ground to cover so you end up with lots of stuff that can't be resolved from the cockpit. \n\nThat being said a lot of the narrative does take place in the air including most of the definitive top gun moments qnd a huge chunk of the pivotal moments and charachter developments. \n\nIs it a bit more heavy on the surface duty? Sure but they had to deal with the iceman plot line, penny reintroduction, none of that really could be in the air. Plus a big chunk of the son of Goose story has to be done on the ground because there's only so much ofnthat can be settled in the air, but surprisingly most of it is.  Plus you get stuff like sailing penny's  boat to fill in some gaps. \n\nOverall I see your point. But realistically how much flight time could they really buy from the US Navy. I think they got a good balance. A near perfect sequel that hit the same notes with different instruments and a machine of a man called Tom Cruise. It's airplane porn of the highest and filthiest order.",

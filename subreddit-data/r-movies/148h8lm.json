    "postText": "So, kind of a hot take, but David Lynch's rabbits is my favourite horror series of all time. I know this is kind of a weird pick but it is just so well made, everything is just perfect from how the characters talk to the werid noises that just randomly appear.\n\nJust curious on what are your thounghts on this\n\n(Btw did you know Naomi watts appears on this!?!)",

Evey last aspect of the show just adds to an uncanny feeling which for me ends up being more terrorific than any cheap jumpscare almost every horror series relies on.",

    "postText": "I watched The Wizard of Oz in its entirety for the first time recently, and the main body of the film being a dream sequence totally breaks it.\n\nSo the moral is that rather than running away to a fantasy world where your dog, your only friend in the world, will be by your side for everything that happens, and where you'll also make new friends, you should instead stay home, where your only friend is your dog and the local government has ordered that your dog be euthanized.\n\nLook, the stuff about how Dorothy's friends were already smart/caring/brave and were just beset by a lack of confidence was really good. I loved that! But it's not a real moral, because those friends weren't real. Dorothy's subconscious made them up. The point of that stuff is how it informs the real world part of the story. And it doesn't, really.\n\nAnd yeah, I know that the dream stuff wasn't in the book, but I think it was added to the movie during the initial screenwriting phase, not as reshoots. So it should've felt more connected.",

And yes, there's a strong undertone of melancholy in the movie, and in the most famous song from the movie, \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow.\" \n\nThe lesson of the movie, I think, is that we have to rely on each other in times of trouble, it's about family and friends and community. And we need intelligence and courage and heart in order to get through those troubles together.",

The end represents attainment of self realization or a wholeness of character. Dorothy at the beginning is essentially a child, with no say in adult affairs, even when regarding her own pet. The home is representing self, she wants to psychologically escape her true being.\n\nIn Oz, Dorothy learns she is an independent woman with courage who can stand up for herself. She also learns that the traits people think they are lacking are often there the whole time. She emerges from successfully completing her trials as a confident and capable adult who find there is no place like home, aka, she need only look inward for the strength she needs.",

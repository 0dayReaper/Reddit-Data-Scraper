    "postText": "Just watched Passengers (2016) for the first time and thought the premise was really interesting but really poorly executed. I know it's said too often but the same premise would definitely have worked better as a thriller from Aurora's perspective or, at the very least, a deeper exploration of the horror of the situation. \n\nIt got me wondering what other movies have a great premise (or even just some great ideas) that were just poorly executed?",

            "comment": "Lightyear (2022) was trying too many things at once. The idea of a spaceman being caught in accelerated aging and having to watch his friends die is tragic and haunting. Unfortunately that was mostly devoted to the opening scene of the movie. The concept of training up a space ranger team was also undercooked to me, and a lot of the action didn't do much to advance the story. I think it would have worked better if Pixar had created a whole new sci-fi world instead of trying to tie this one to Buzz Lightyear.",

And it had potential...great message about leadership and friendship and diversity, great visual settings with an almost Christopher Nolan aesthetic. But it just didn't click together into a satisfactory Pixar adventure.\n\nThe Zurg twist was ridiculous. I always thought of Zurg as his own character, not an evil Buzz from the future!",

I've never seen a film's plot unintentionally screech to a halt as soon as Rebecca Quincey's on screen. It's not like she's badly acted: it's just that her whole shtick is so benign and pedestrian compared to anything Renfield could be doing. \n\nIt really felt like they had the story written for a 40 minute film, and figured that the premise that Nicholas Cage was in the film would fill in the other 50 minutes.",

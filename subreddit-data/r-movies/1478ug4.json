    "postText": "I\u2019m not an expert, but aren\u2019t comparisons between the two movies crazy? It\u2019s basically commonplace now where Aladdin keeps getting brought up in articles, but every inflation calculator has Aladdin doing WAY better domestically and internationally they\u2019re not even in the same realm. Unless I\u2019m calculating it wrong.\n\nIt looks like domestically to match where Aladdin was at this point Little Mermaid would need to make $50 MILLION more\u2026That\u2019s not peanuts. How can there be legitimate money/audience comparisons between the films?",

Top Gun Maverick, Mario, Avatar 2, Guardians 3 all doing well.\n\nI'm from the Philippines and it makes me laugh every time they claim the movie is doing well here. It's not.\n\nBeauty &amp; the Beast made 15M here. Aladdin made 10M.\n\nTLM is only a measly 5M when it would have made 10-15M if they had cast Ariel accurately. Unfortunately, we have many people here who would watch any Disney crap. But more people refused to see this movie, like 5-10M worth of tickets.\n\nAriel was more popular than Jasmine. It would have definitely done better than Aladdin numbers here.\n\nEveryone knows cartoon Ariel here. She's one of the popular themes for girl's birthday parties prior to Frozen. Show any random person here the new TLM movie poster and their first reaction would be something like \"Wtf, what happened? Why did they make Ariel a -----???\"",

If we don't ignore the production budget, the movie is not doing well.\n\nA lot depends on how high the production budget actually is.\n\nA lot of people quote the highest estimate, 250 million, but the actual budget might be a bit lower.\n\nIf the budget was 250 million and the movie doesn't make more than 500, that's pretty bad from a financial point of view.\n\nI don't think that the value of showing the movie on Disney+ is going to be great.\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to figure out what the problem is.\n\nThe animated version was succes at the time, but not compared to The Lion King which was released five years later.\n\nAnd it's a movie that's going to appeal more to girls than boys.",

Well, technically there is one for tax purposes, but that's not the number that media outlets publish.\n\nMarketing budgets are also tricky.\n\nEspecially because off cross promotion deals. Typically, Disney gets money for allowing other companies to use trademarked material, or is paid in promotional actions.\n\nMy main point was that people should obsess less with the financial side of things. It's not our money.\n\nI think Disney is definitely disappointed with the box office and it's possible that the movie will lose a significant amount of money, but the movie is not a flop or a box office bomb.\n\nDisney had a gross profit of 28 billion in 2022. Its net profit was 3 billion.\n\nThe real issue for Disney is the amount of money Disney+ is losing. In my opinion they need to figure out how to make less expensive content.",

If we take Little Mermaid as an example, the movie is produced by three production companies:\n\nWalt Disney Pictures\r, Lucamar Productions\r, and Marc Platt Productions. It is distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.\n\nThese are **four separate companies**.\n\nDisney+ is another separate company. (Its parent is Disney Streaming. Which is owned by The Walt Disney Company.)\n\n(I'm using the word company here loosely, I haven't delved into the legal structure of the divisions and companies under Disney umbrella.)\n\nIf Little Mermaid is released on Disney+, Disney Streaming has to pay Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures and this has to be reflected on the balance sheet of the Little Mermaid.\n\nJust because two companies hare a parent company, doesn't mean that the exchange of goods between those two companies is free.\n\nThis is relevant to the IRS, probably to the production companies, but also to the companies that financed the movies.",

    "postText": " \n\nHey everyone, I wanted to ask if anyone on this subreddit has seen this film and if they could help me out with it. I'm helping a professor teach a film studies course and we are having a hard time finding a copy of this film with English subtitles (the original is on YouTube but without subs). The professor speaks Ukrainian and Russian and would *technically* be able to subtitle it herself, but they won't have enough time ahead of next week's class. If we can't find a subtitled version we will probably have to pick a different film, which is a shame because this film is a pretty powerful early representation of the Holocaust in Eastern European Cinema.\n\nI don't mean to be a burden, and I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit for this. Any help or advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!",

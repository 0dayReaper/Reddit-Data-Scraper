    "postText": "I watched Creed 3 on a plane and the audio wasn't that great so I thought I missed something but when I looked up the synopsis it seems that the only thing he did was pull a gun out but didn't fire it.  18 years in prison seems like an exceptionally long time for a minor to receive for pulling out a gun during a fight.  He didn't even fire it and as far as I can tell no one in the fight was critically injured.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Not to mention Leon would have to corroborate that story that Dame attacked him which doesn't seem likely at all.",

I mean all he did was win sure he played a little dirty but it's not like he tried to kill the guy or anything. Also the scene on the beach where he said I'm coming for everything to creed. Like WTF does that even mean? Creed was retired and the guy already had the belt WTF was he going to rob his house? Going to be honest the movie was kind of shitty.",

    "postText": "I find it pretty curious how Shaun and Hot Fuzz are two of his most celebrated films, with Scott Pilgrim being liked (and having a cult following), but otherwise each film after has gotten a pretty muted reception. Can't say I'm hyped about his upcoming projects, either.\n\nBaby Driver might be his biggest financial hit though, but does anyone rank it high? Last Night in Soho is universally treated as his worst one yet (exception his first feature film, which I consider pretty much a student film).\n\nI think his style just ran out of steam, and otherwise there was nothing much else there. Any other takes?\n\nEdit.\nSome good points made, some fun roasting.",

I understand why people think Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead are his best but I think Worlds End and SP's plots, writing, editing, etc are way better but that's probably just personal preference, also both more adult in their tones and themes which I prefer more to the goofy dark comedies with one big serious moment. \n\n Baby Driver is good and all, but it feels bland in comparison to all his other films, like it's lacking something, his style and writing doesn't seem as great as it was in the Cornetto Trilogy or Scott Pilgrim, and I have yet to see Soho so I can't speak for it",

It didn't do great financially but the ratings and reviews were mostly positive. The cinematography alone is worth the watch.\n\n&gt;I think his style just ran out of steam\n\nAnd what exactly is his style? Other than the Cornetto Trilogy, which had similar humor, he's made a movie based on a graphic novel, a soundtrack-driven action movie, and a Hitchcock-style thriller, among others.\n\nLastly I'll just add than while I know I'm in the minority, The World's End is my personal favorite of his. It's hilarious and Gary King is a great character (Simon Pegg has said it's his favorite character he's played, so there's one vote).",

I think it\u2019s fine that he branches out and tries new things but sometimes they don\u2019t play to his strengths.

I can\u2019t speak to any outside of the Furious movie he did however so no idea how they went, but I\u2019m sure there are some who believe he should stick to horror, and some who liked his newer ventures. \n\nPersonally I loved the Cornetto Trilogy (all of them) and really liked Baby Driver.

He definitely needs Simon Pegg as a writer to round his scripts out and give his characters more hear. I actually think I lost respect for him after that movie as I think its the most disappointing movie from a hyped up and a favorite director I may have ever seen, not a complete failure but I was disappointed. I definitely think I agree with you now but I like all of his movies before his last.",

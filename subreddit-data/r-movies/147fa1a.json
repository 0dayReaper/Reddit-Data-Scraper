    "postText": "Been noticing a lot of multiverse movies lately like no way home and spiderverse. Hell some shows are dabbling in dimension hopping like Sonic prime. But from the majority of movies and shows I've seen with this theme. Is the conflict comes from the time-space continuum collapsing, whether by direct means or accidents.\n\nThere are plenty of time travel movies where they say fuck it to continuity, do multiverse movies have something similar? In short, Is there a film where the danger doesn't come from someone or something destroying realities? ",

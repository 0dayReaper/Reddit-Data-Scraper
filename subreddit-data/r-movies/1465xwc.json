Who do you think could play Freddy Kruger, now that Englund has said that he would not return to the role?\n\n3.  Who do you think would be the best actress to play Nancy Thompson?  Or should there even be a Nancy Thompson at all?\n\n4.  Who do you think would be the best director for a new movie or series?\n\n5.  Are there any new potental Freddy reboots in the works?",

            "comment": "If Englund isn't coming back, it might be better just to leave the series alone.  It's not as franchiseable as the other main horror series, and *New Nightmare* essentially deconstructed the mythos.  Freddy's method works less as an ongoing mythos and more as a metaphor like it was in the brilliant original film.  Unlike Michael and Jason, the character is so totally tied to Englund that having Freddy come back in a \"same but different\" way with another actor like Haley did in that horrendous remake wouldn't work.  \n\nIf a new version would be made, I think it should focus on a new villain who uses the same MO as Freddy and who even exists in a world where Freddy exists.",

Maybe he could just be \"the next\" and the victims could recognize that some similar things are happening to what they heard rumor of happening in Springwood.  The new villain's circumstances would need to be different and updated.  It couldn't just be the same \"parents kill child abuser\".  I think that having the same conceit but doing it in a different way is the way to go, if a new film must be made.  However, it's so unlikely this would be done.",

Then he returns to have his revenge on the parents and childeren. Make Freddy scary again but he could crack a joke and stuff. Make Nancy Thompson the main character as well.",

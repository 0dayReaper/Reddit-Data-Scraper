            "comment": "ONE WEEKEND in 2012, an atheist film-maker discussed secularism and the compulsory wearing of the hijab (headscarf), among other topics, with four Iranian mullahs. Mehran Tamadon, the film-maker, recorded the whole thing, hoping to initiate a dialogue with the supporters of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The resulting documentary, \u201cIranian\u201d, had the opposite effect. Iranian intelligence agents confiscated Mr Tamadon\u2019s passport in 2012 and, on returning it, told him to leave the country. He has not returned since.\n\nHis story has become depressingly familiar in Iran, where censors ban any work considered critical of the theocracy. Dissenting directors are subject to travel restrictions, interrogations and imprisonment. Despite all this, cinema continues to be an outlet for resistance against the regime. After a long hiatus, Mr Tamadon has resumed his \u201csocial experiments\u201d, this time turning his lens on the barbaric techniques deployed in Iran\u2019s prisons. His two new films, \u201cWhere God Is Not\u201d (pictured, above) and \u201cMy Worst Enemy\u201d, have their premiere in Britain at Sheffield DocFest this month.\n\nIn \u201cWhere God Is Not\u201d three exiled Iranians re-enact their experiences of solitary confinement and torture in jail, including the notorious Evin prison in Tehran where thousands of political prisoners are detained. Mr Tamadon\u2019s subjects are Mazyar Ebrahimi, a businessman who was accused of being a spy; Homa Kalhori, who wrote about the devastating torture she endured in the 1980s in her memoir \u201cA Coffin for the Living\u201d; and Taghi Rahmani, a journalist who has spent over 14 years in prison.\n\nEach describes the horrors that their captors inflicted on them. The former prisoners remember the size of their solitary cells in paces. Mr Ebrahimi recollects how his tormentors played ping-pong after beating him in a makeshift torture chamber. To his persecutors, he implies, it was all a game. \u201cWhere God Is Not\u201d is hard to watch, but that is the point, says Mr Tamadon in the film. He wants the abusers to confront their inhumanity when they see the documentary. They are however, unlikely to have the chance\u2014and the film\u2019s subjects dispute the idea that brainwashing can be countered so easily. \u201cStop patting yourself on the back!\u201d Mr Rahmani tells the director.\nA still from My Worst Enemy\n\nIn \u201cMy Worst Enemy\u201d (see above), Mr Tamadon ends up agreeing with the naysayers. The film itself rebuts the claim that cinema can \u201cmake the interrogator doubt himself\u201d, as the director puts it. Zar Amir Ebrahimi, a prominent Iranian actor who is also in exile (and is not related to Mazyar Ebrahimi), stages a mock interrogation of Mr Tamadon. She forces him to strip, hoses him down with icy water and makes him stand for hours. She lampoons the notion that you can conduct a meaningful conversation with a \u201ckiller holding all the power\u201d. In any case, she asks him, in making these films, isn\u2019t he profiting from others\u2019 suffering? Mr Tamadon may not altogether have lost his faith in cinema\u2019s ability to inspire change, but it is evidently wavering.\n\nNonetheless the visceral depiction of torture and interrogation in both films reflects a bold shift in Iranian cinema. After decades of employing subtle references to evade censors, auteurs are showing violence even though it invites allegations of \u201csiah namayi\u201d, or \u201cpainting black\u201d Iran\u2019s image. For example, in \u201cHoly Spider\u201d (2022), a religious extremist murders sex workers; \u201cLaw of Tehran\u201d (2019) is a gory crime thriller. This defiance reflects the mood in Iran, where anti-government protests have continued since the death in custody last September of Mahsa Amini.\n\n\u201cMy Worst Enemy\u201d succeeds in capturing the process by which the abused can become the abuser. In the film, Ms Ebrahimi expresses her shock at the excitement she feels as Mr Tamadon\u2019s interrogator. She attributes her vicious feelings to her own repeated questioning by security forces: having been denied power, she now wields it. The film insinuates that the depredations of a totalitarian regime can unleash an individual\u2019s potential to commit heinous acts. This echoes Mr Rahmani\u2019s warning in \u201cWhere God Is Not\u201d: \u201cMan is a wolf to fellow man,\u201d he tells Mr Tamadon. \u201cDon\u2019t become that wolf.\u201d \u25a0\n\n\u201cWhere God Is Not\u201d and \u201cMy Worst Enemy\u201d have their premiere in Britain at Sheffield DocFest between June 14th and 18th",

I don't care if one Letterboxd \"influencer\" watches an indie flick and gives it a sarcastic review, that ends up with getting more eyeballs on that movie and people watching it in earnest.",

No one\u2019s attacking me for watching my obscure stuff, and no one\u2019s attacking me for watching the mainstream stuff. I\u2019m just doing my own thing and loving cinema.\n\nIt seems that you may be seeking out this culture, because it\u2019s not as grand as you\u2019re making it out to be.",

If you want to do more than just watching and enjoying films on your own, maybe look into some popular reviewers and read what they have to say about it and you can get your discussion that way.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t subject yourself to something you find toxic when film is a very individual thing that requires no participation of others.",

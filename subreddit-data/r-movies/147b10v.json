    "postText": "Edit: Guys, don\u2019t comment if it is **your personal take on the film.** I\u2019m really starting to wonder if at least half of you are functionally illiterate.\n\nEdit 2: If I see one more *the last Jedi* I\u2019m gonna lose my mind. I\u2019m not asking for critically acclaimed movies that were poorly received by fans/audience\u2026 read again.\n\nThe Thing (1982) was *hated* by critics when it was first released. Some outright called it wretched trash. Now, it\u2019s considered to be one of the greatest horror/Sci-Fi films of all time.\n\nWhat other films are like this, except in reverse? I don\u2019t care much for general audience reception changing. Is there any example where *critics* admitted that they were too lenient on a film or admitted that the film is a well-received trash?",

It\u2019s the problem with years when there\u2019s a broad selection of pretty good movies each with their own constituencies. For instance, it\u2019s not hard to imagine a more significant chunk of BlacKKKlansman\u2019s votes falling to Green Book as opposed to Roma. I think that wound up being the case for a lot of the nominees.\n\nEdit: I offer this theory to counter the notion that people voted against Roma because Steven Spielberg told everyone to hate on Netflix, which is a load of wishful-thinking horseshit.",

The alternative is (potentially) getting a movie that a small percentage love but the rest of the voters hate.  \n\nFor example, say we have 10 movies and people generally like movies 1-9 but hate movie 10. Voters of 1-9 have a different first place vote so none of them get more than 10% but movie #10 gets 11% (with the other 89% hating it). Do you think #10 should win? Or should one of the other nine win based on some sort of consensus? That's basically what ranked choice voting is. Personally, I'm here for it.\n\nThat being said, I don't know if that situation really had anything to do with ranked choice voting. It might have but I don't know anything about it.",

In New York there were Klan-themed balls and, in Chicago that Halloween, thousands of college students dressed in robes for a massive Klan-themed party.[81]  \n  \nDue to the technical innovations I might have to watch it sometime, but it will hurt I imagine.",

Music performed live unnecessarily, actors who starved and dehydrated themselves so they couldn\u2019t sing properly, letting the actors have multiple different vocal coaches depending on their location which resulted in learning too much and not enough.\n\nEverything went wrong so it\u2019s a miracle it even released. Marius, Cosette, and \u00c9ponine are all great in the movie, and, as you said, \u00c9ponine was the only stage actor in the film and she\u2019s the best part of the film relegated to like two songs.\n\nFor a show that is majority singing, and replacing all but one of the singers with actors, you really sideline the singing in a musical - and when you make those non-singers perform their music live with rain and acoustics and hidden microphones and action while everyone else has to not make any noises or risk being heard and the pianist having to play live while the actors can\u2019t hear the piano so they have to guess the timing\u2026it was just, all the wrong decisions when making a stage musical into a movie, and that\u2019s why it seems so difficult.\n\nNot to say it would have been easy, just that they forwent any manner to make it easier.",

The author mentions how the movie was initially reviewed differently than it is currently assessed. Here's a snippet:   \n\n\n&gt;The funniest thing: At the time, we considered this sort of overdemonstrative bullshit to be good acting. Face/Off got great reviews, and all of them talked about the great job that Cage did. Later on, the world would turn on Cage\u2019s insanity, forcing him down into the direct-to-DVD world. But it was on full display even when Cage was on top of the world. And while it\u2019s hard to call what Cage did in Face/Off a good performance in retrospect, it was certainly mesmerizing.",

People back then were also saying how unrealistic it was that two space stations would be that close together. The odds of being able to travel between them completely unguided was next to impossible and they weren't even on the same orbital plane\n\nNo one said it was \"accurate\". It was a pretty good drama about overcoming astronomical (heheh) challenges and the will to survive. The \"accuracy\" was about how well it put space on the big screen and the massive amounts of tech they used to do it. You have to admit it's one of the best looking space movies that are pretty close to actual current space travel",

It was an interesting way to weave meta commentary into the story and fit well with the original\u2019s themes about merchandizing science. \n\nThen the sequels happened and we got laser guided raptors, the Freddy Krueger dinosaur, the underground dinosaur fighting ring, Elon Musk at home and fire proof locusts and all of those themes fell the fuck apart.",

Almost everyone I knew wanted the next two movies to take things in a new direction though. The issue is TLJ ended up controversial and that kind of messed everything up. So now people see TFA as a lazily safe reboot to a trilogy that ended things way too predicably.\n\nIf Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker successfully moved the franchise forward in a way audiences received well then I think Force Awakens would hold up fine.",

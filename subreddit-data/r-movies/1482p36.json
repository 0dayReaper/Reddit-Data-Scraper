    "postText": "I was told I should make a thread here for this a while back because of the amount of movie fans that would be interested, so here it is.\n\nSo much movie knowledge was lost that can't be found elsewhere when IMDb removed their boards, particularly on older boards, and this little browser add-on restores that knowledge. Just go to the link below and select the browser you are using and a couple seconds later you will have the IMDb boards back inside each page on IMDb with all old posts restored. It's as if they never left. You can even make new posts as well.\n\nhttp://www.restoreimdbboards.com\n\nIf enough people install it then the IMDb boards will be back like they used to, so spread the word.\n\nIf you want to post on the boards you will have to create an account at Filmboards.com, which is where the archives are pulled from. You can even restore your old IMDb posts to your account if you want by going to this link: https://filmboards.com/board/p/1956273/",

    "postText": "I'm watching The Shining for the who-knows-how-many time. I actually watched it in the theater when it was first released. Months before the trailer they used was simply the vision Tony shows Danny before he goes the Overlook of the blood pouring out by the elevator. Solid movie. It is just plain creepy.\n\nJust last week I read an article about why exactly it is so frightening. There are times in the movie that Jack Nicholson looks directly into the camera giving the viewer the sense that they are actually a part of what is happening. They happen so quickly that you've probably never noticed. I know I hadn't. This time as I watch I'm deliberately looking for them and an hour in I've already spotted three.\n\nEdit: I've always considered the bathroom scene the scariest. Tonight I realized why. The dead woman is staring directly into the camera with her arms outstretched the entire time she's laughing.",

When Danny is riding around on his bike for example there is a wall about 1 meter thick and it has hotelroom doors. As you can see [here](https://www.themarysue.com/impossible-shining/) the layout of the hotel is really weird.",

Book-Jack was an abusive asshole who can barely contain his violent rage (even when sober), which is apparent because it of course is, in large part, told from his perspective.  \n\nMovie-Jack *might* be the same kind of person (as we don't get that much of insight into his psyche), but I think he comes across (in the beginning, of course) as less menacing and more aloof and Jack Nicholson-weird in general. Like, I can believe that he broke Danny's arm by mistake (and being drunk) the way he tells it in the movie and is honestly sorry about it, in the book he comes across as the kind of guy that'd do that by design or indifference. Like, he almost beat one of his students to death (while sober, not that it matters much) just because the letter let the air out of his tires. This is a scary dude that you wouldn't want to be around, no matter if he's drunk or not.  \n\nMy theory is that Book-Jack is so autobiographical (King has confirmed this, but he also said that he \u2014 quite baffingly in my opinion \u2014 didn't realize this until years later, so I guess he was/is kind of in denial about how the character is presented) that King can't really see him as the extremely repulsive character he is. He's not a \"normal, well-meaning guy going crazy\", he's an abusive husband/father going to the (sadly realistic) extreme of what might happen with that kind of person, with supernatural elements and cabin fever added but frankly not necessary for his downfall. Movie-Jack is a more compelling \"weird dad\" going crazy because of ghosts and isolation.",

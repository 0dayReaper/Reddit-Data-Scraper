    "postText": "I take a interest in True Crime, like most people these recent years. I do because I want to hear their story and understand, as well as feeling bad for the survivors/victims. This year I have been watching more movies about it. So far I have watched, The Girl In The Basement, The Girl In The Box, The Girl Who Escaped: The Kara Robinson Story, Believe Me: The Abduction of Lisa McVey, Cleveland Abduction, and I THINK that that\u2019s it. If you have any recommendations like those movies then please tell me some and have a good rest of your day.",

            "comment": "I find it hard sometimes to watch things like Cleveland Abduction the true story is fresh enough and often the productions don't bring enough weight to the stories. \n\nSnowtown comes to mind it's Aussie and definitely not light or easy to watch.  \n\nHenry Portrait of a Serial Killer was quite a dark ride. True enough to be on the list in my opinion.\n\nMindhunter the series just 2 seasons but great true crime stories",

            "comment": "Like you, I find this genre fascinating.  The TV show *Law and Order* is fiction but many of the episodes are based on real life events.  It's satisfying because the bad guy is always caught.\n\nthere was a superb HBO movie called *Citizen X* from a couple decades ago.  100% true story.  I think u can watch it for free on youtube\n\nA movie called *In Cold Blood* based on the book of the same name written by Truman Capote is quite good.  The movie *Capote,* about the process the author made when he wrote that book is also good.\n\nother good movies in this genre:\n\n*Zodiac*\n\n*Spotlight*\n\n*Bonnie and Clyde*\n\n*Dog Day Afternoon*\n\n**My favorite true crime story of all time is a book:** ***The Summer Wind*** **by George Anastasia.**  It was turned into a really bad made-for-tv movie.  Find the book. (Library or used online... really inexpensive)  You won't be sorry.",

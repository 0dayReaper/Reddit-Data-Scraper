I want it to feel as if the audience coming into this one isn\u2019t as comfortable with Art the Clown as they feel they are now\n\nI want to go on the record to say I have never been in any way shape or form comfortable with Art the clown. \n\n\nAlso,\n\nI could have sworn part three was going to be broken up into two movies. There's no reason that part two needed a 2.5 hour run time.",

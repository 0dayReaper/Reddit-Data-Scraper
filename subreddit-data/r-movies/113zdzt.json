            "comment": "Statement from the Willis Family:\n&gt;As a family, we wanted to take this opportunity to thank you all for the outpouring of love and compassion for Bruce over the past ten months. Your generosity of spirit has been overwhelming, and we are tremendously grateful for it. For your kindness, and because we know you love Bruce as much as we do, we wanted to give you an update.\n\n&gt;Since we announced Bruce\u2019s diagnosis of aphasia in spring 2022, Bruce\u2019s condition has progressed and we now have a more specific diagnosis: frontotemporal dementia (known as FTD). Unfortunately, challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces. While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis.  \n\n&gt;FTD is a cruel disease that many of us have never heard of and can strike anyone. For people under 60, FTD is the most common form of dementia, and because getting the diagnosis can take years, FTD is likely much more prevalent than we know. Today there are no treatments for the disease, a reality that we hope can change in the years ahead. As Bruce\u2019s condition advances, we hope that any media attention can be focused on shining a light on this disease that needs far more awareness and research.  \n\n&gt;Bruce always believed in using his voice in the world to help others, and to raise awareness about important issues both publicly and privately. We know in our hearts that \u2013 if he could today \u2014 he would want to respond by bringing global attention and a connectedness with those who are also dealing with this debilitating disease and how it impacts so many individuals and their families.  \n\n&gt;Ours is just one family with a loved one who suffers from FTD, and we encourage others facing it to seek out the wealth of information and support available through AFTD (@theaftd, theaftd.org). And for those of you who have been fortunate enough to not have any personal experience with FTD, we hope that you will take the time to learn about it, and support AFTD\u2019s mission in whatever way you can. \n\n&gt;Bruce has always found joy in life \u2013 and has helped everyone he knows to do the same. It has meant the world to see that sense of care echoed back to him and to all of us. We have been so moved by the love you have all shared for our dear husband, father, and friend during this difficult time. Your continued compassion, understanding, and respect will enable us to help Bruce live as full a life as possible. \n\n&gt;-Emma, Demi, Rumer, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel, and Evelyn",

He\u2019d be in the room, but there was often no recognition or spirit in his eyes. I was a kid, so I don\u2019t really remember how he was before. He died about 7 years after diagnosis.\n\nWhen I was in high school he has one lucid day. He helped me build a light table. Cut a cord off an old lamp and showed me how to wire it to the bulb in my light table.\n\nEventually realized I liked building that with him more than I liked animating.",

Dementia is the degeneration of the brain, so one would assume its a straight line downwards... But sometimes very close to the end they have small bursts of lucidity where they seem very much like their old selves again. It's an odd thing, kind of bittersweet. You get them back and then lose them all over again.",

She called my Dad the name of her childhood bully, and told him to leave. It's one of very few times I've seen my Dad cry.",

I went with my mom to visit her when I was about 17, before we went into her room my cousin (her daughter) told us her memory had regressed to around WWII era and that she thought the war was still going on.   Thankfully my mother had a lot of experience with the elderly and those with dementia and before we walked in she told me \"Whatever your aunt says or asks you, just go with it.  She doesn't understand we're in 1990, in her mind we're in 1942.\"  We walked in and my aunts face lit up like a light, she came over and grabbed my face and started kissing me and crying, saying over and over again \"Joey...Joey...you're home...oh thank God, you're home.  Joey...I prayed to the Immaculate Conception everyday that she would bring you and Johnny home and now, you're HOOOME!!\"  \n\n\"Joey\" was my father and \"Johnny\" was her husband (and my dad's brother).  I followed my mom's advice and just rolled with it and played the part of my father until she sorta blanked out and became focused on my mother.  It was a very surreal experience for me, especially the realization that me and my dad look nearly identical.",

My mother has dementia and for years I kept telling my father that something wasn't right with mom. It was subtle. She would lose her keys or the normal things that come with age. Then she started to check the mailbox three times in a row and ask me when the mail was coming.... With it in her hand. My dad would make excuses out of fear but it was getting noticeable.\n\nOne day at my house she said she thought she was \"losing her mind.\" I agreed and asked her to, please, go to the doctor. I'll set it up! She said \"no, just promise you'll put me out of my misery when it gets too bad.\" We chuckled a bit and I said of course I would. What else can you say to something incurable and frightening? \n\nMy mother is in a home now, only two years later, and she has moments of clarity. Sometimes it is refreshing because I get my mother back, briefly. The downside of that is actually the clarity itself. She realizes she's only 70 (most in the home are much older) and she has wild ranges of emotion in that clarity. Last month she tried to strangle herself with a ball of yarn. She survived mostly because she forgot how to tie a knot. When I asked why she said, \"because I remembered!\"\n\nPoint is- you can make a pact, you can say you'll do yourself in but you're right. By the time it happens to you it is likely you and most around you never saw it coming, it is gradual, and it is too late. Until you maybe have a fleeting moment of clarity and realize what's happening but you are powerless over what's become of who you were and the shell you will become. Now I dread the clarity. In those moments she is capable of mourning who she once was and I'm not sure whose heart it breaks more.",

That the Bruce here now is not the Bruce of the past *who would have used his voice* for the causes he cares about. His \"voice\" is essentially who he is... which dementia can ravage. So they are referring to who he was when he was of sound mind. So, that past tense is sad to see.\n\nThat is all my comment boils down to. I don't see the point of everyone getting into a grammar argument here, tenses being pored over. I'd hope *my intention* could be gleaned the same way this family's was, yanno?",

Good news is her family and I have remained close and now that my children are over 18 I still go to their family holidays/birthday celebrations etc. I really never left being a part of their family.

I had no idea. I suspected it was partly the Parkinson's and partly the medication they were trying to dial in for her while waiting for her surgery that was responsible for the episodes.\n\nA lot of it was auditory and she'd constantly ask us to make the dogs stop barking that she was constantly hearing off in the distance. There were also people in the walls / vents who were trying to get her. Lots of things of that nature.\n\nEdit: when she finally had surgery to re-implant her DBS device she could barely remember any of the time she spent in the hospital without the device and could barely recall any of her hallucinations.\n\nTo her the 6 month ordeal is basically lost time.",

I think that it was a case of him being well aware that something was wrong, and cashing it all in to make as much money as he could for his children before he couldn't do it anymore.\n\nHe made a ridiculous amount of garbage movies in a very short time.  But he made $$$$$$$$$$$$.\n\nAnd I dont blame him in the least.  If I knew that my mind was failing me and I only had finite time left to be productive and help my family, I'd do the same thing.",

He wasn't forgetful really, so I didn't suspect dementia, but it just seemed like something was... off. \n\nHe was finally diagnosed around 62 when we became concerned enough to take him to the doc. By that time he had totaled his car because he didn't see the truck barreling through the intersection that he turned out in front of. Luckily no one was hurt. \n\nNot long after his diagnosis he was halfway through reading a 700 page biography when he lost the ability to read. As an avid reader, it crushed him. \n\n\"It's just so strange,\" he'd tell me. \"I'm looking at these words, and I *know* I should be able to read them, but they just look like symbols. Like hieroglyphics.\" \n\nNot long after that came the aphasia that Willis has been suffering, which confounded my dad even more than losing the ability to read. He'd look at the sky, know that it's blue, but couldn't understand how to communicate that color. \n\nFrom there we had a couple decent years before things got bleak. We pulled together as a family unit. We got close. We went on vacations. I helped him empty his office &amp; wrap up all the loose ends he could remember. There were as many laughs as there were tears, and I'll always cherish both. \n\nAt 69 he's now bedbound &amp; wasting away, unable to communicate in any decipherable way beyond an occasional chuckle or tone of voice. \n\nIt's beyond heartbreaking, but we had our long goodbye, and for that I'm grateful. A lot of people don't get to say goodbye at all.\n\nI hope Willis &amp; his family can make peace with this &amp; come together like we did.",

He was a lawyer but started getting into some odd business choices. However, at the same time he started becoming a lot more religious and most of the suspicious business ventures were in conjunction with other people he me through his religious groups so it was chalked up towards that.\n\nHe did definitely have some pretty severe changes to his personality as it progressed as well, switching between wanting to help family move to his city/start new careers to abandoning a cousin of mine after he moved to a new city at my uncles insistence. My cousin ended up living in his car until he was able to make it back to our city (happened to my cousin, he was not my uncle\u2019s son though).\n\nHe refused to get any help, and just hid it all behind his increasingly devout religious beliefs, and eventually moved to another continent entirely.\n\nBy, he had already been divorced from his wife and pushed away his kids and the rest of the extended family, as he often acted very cruel and judgemental towards everyone.\n\nA couple years after he moved and we stopped hearing from him at all, a former friend of his found him wandering the streets and we were finally able to forcibly get him committed to a hospital, and he was diagnosed finally.\n\nHe ended up being put into a home at that point which helped him live in a lot more comfort and stability. Sadly by this point he was very far gone and had almost no short term memory. He lived another few years there before passing away.\n\nHe was able to at least somewhat make amends with his children though, so a bit of a silver lining there.\n\n\nSorry, this was all pretty disjointed, I haven\u2019t talked much about this recently and it just kind of came out in a jumble typed on my phone during a coffee break at work.",

His symptoms include losing focus (ADD-like symptoms), trouble controlling his temper, trouble with empathy (as in, you'll tell him about something bad that happened to you and he'll just move on and talk about himself as if he doesn't care), trouble recalling names and details, and voicing his thoughts out loud and saying the same thing over and over. Still early days, so no major problems strictly tied to memory or aphasia. My understanding is that the symptoms can vary quite a bit from person to person, because the frontotemporal part of the brain controls a lot of different things.",

It\u2019s like talking to a senile old man\u201d. He was in his mid to late 40s at the time. That caused my mom to start thinking and she took him to a doctor, then a specialist. Shortly after that we got a diagnosis. \u201cUnspecified dementia\u201d I was still single when my father got to the point of needing 24/7 supervision, mom was retired at this time. I moved back in with my parents to help care for dad and let my mom have a life outside caring for my father. It was that or a nursing home. After visiting a few we decided that wasn\u2019t an acceptable option. So we kept him with at home with us. Mom and I had to work out schedules to be sure one of us was a available for \u201cdad duty\u201d. My brother would help out when he could. We had to spoon feed him, make sure he got his medication, make sure he drank enough water, bathe him, dress him and change his depends. Changing a parent\u2019s depends is a very humbling experience.   Once he peed on me while I was changing his depends. He had just enough cognitive function left to be humiliated mumbling I\u2019m sorry over and over. For the last two or three years I would ask him \u201cdad who am I\u201d. His response was to tell me his own name, first name, middle initial, last name. He did that no matter who you asked about. If you asked him any other question the answer was \u201cfifteen cents\u201d. We never figured out what was about. It was during this stage that the 9/11 happened. He was a Korean War Vet. As we watched the opening ceremonies for the Olympics he saw the US team carrying the tattered US flag from the Trade Center, he started crying repeatedly say no, no. You never know what they understand or perceive.  \n\nOnce I took a vacation to Cancun. I was single living in my parents house, I had a good deal of disposable income. When I got to the hotel I sat on the edge of the bed anxiously fidgeting trying to figure out why I couldn\u2019t relax. I kept feeling like there was something I should be doing. Then it dawned on me I didn\u2019t have anything that I \u201chad\u201d to do. I flopped back on the bed and woke up at 10:30 the next morning. I slept for 14 hours straight. My room mate says he tried to wake me up to go to dinner. He says I threw a shoe at him. I don\u2019t remember any of that.\n\nOne night he passed peacefully in his sleep. I had a strange mix of emotions. Grief at the loss of my father and relief that it was finally over. And then guilt for feeling even the slightest bit relieved. I felt like I was a bad son, an evil heartless person. \n\nThere is nothing humorous about dementia. It\u2019s a brutal disease that slowly kills a person\u2019s personality but leave the body intact. You see an adult, a person you remember as a sharp intelligent person reduced to the mentality of a very young child. It\u2019s horrible to watch the person you love slowly disappear leaving an empty shell. It\u2019s even more brutal on the loved ones and the caregivers. At least at some point the victim stops understanding what\u2019s happening. At least my father reached that point. His idea of a good day was watching Loony Tunes or the Three Stooges. It\u2019s something I would not wish on my worst and most hated enemy or their loved ones. \n\nSorry for the long ramblings. Tonight is the first time I\u2019ve talked about this to anyone except my wife. But I think people need to understand what dementia does, to the victim, the loved ones and caregivers be they family or professional.",

He appeared to be closing out his career as an A-List actor with a series of very, very low effort performances in very cheap movies. It's hard to understand how he could need the money badly enough for that, or how it was possible that he could not just take on a blockbuster role that required more effort, but also would bring in a bigger paycheck.\n\nOf course, his mental condition puts it in an entirely different light. Presumably he was just not capable of taking on roles that required more from him. He was likely scared of what was coming in the future, and a way to keep earning millions of dollars for him and his family would have been a real blessing.\n\nIt's a shame there was a period where it did just look like he was purposefully destroying his own reputation for some easy money. But honestly, I don't even really see it as those film producers taking advantage of him. Both sides benefited.",

She just started a 2-year clinical trial for a drug called AL001 by Alector, where we learned via a genetic test that she has a genetic mutation causing her brain to not produce enough of a protein called progranulin, which over time causes the frontal lobe to deteriorate, usually starting between ages 50-60.  \n\nWe also learned that each of her offspring has a 50/50 chance of having the same genetic mutation, which would guarantee without exception the development of frontotemporal dementia.  My brother and I both were tested and BOTH have the mutation.\n\nWe're both in our early 40s which means we each have 10-20 years for this drug or a similar one to be approved by the FDA so we can take it preventatively as a monthly injection to delay if not completely avoid symptoms.\n\nI'm pretty confident there will be a drug to prevent FTD on the market in the next 5-10 years.  I sure as shit hope so.\n\nThey're still enrolling people in phase 3 of the clinical trial at sites all over the globe, so if you know someone with FTD or aphasia, just Google Alector AL001 and get them in!\n\nAlso: you can get a lab test at LabCorp to measure neurofilament light chain, which if elevated is an early indicator that the frontal lobe damage has started (but it's also elevated after concussions etc).",

Hopefully this can quickly clear some confusion:\n\nThe term dementia essentially means that there is evidence of cognitive decline to the extent that he now requires assistance with functional activities (driving, paying bills, etc.). It is an umbrella term kind of like the word cancer. There are lots of things that cause dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia.\n\n\nThe cause of his dementia is called frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), which is ALSO an umbrella term. Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a type of FTLD that leads to frontotemporal dementia (FTD).\n\n\nSo, basically his aphasia is PPA and has now progressed to dementia.",

It\u2019s gut wrenching to watch someone you love disappear in front of your eyes. It\u2019s hard on everyone. My heart goes out to all the victims and caregivers who struggle with this horror every day.",

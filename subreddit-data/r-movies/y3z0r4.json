They eventually look at Matt Damon to contribute and he quotes a song, at which point they disgustedly tell him he just offended their handler (\"You called his niece a whore; a very cheap one. She's seven.\")\n\nLater in the movie it's revealed that they were just screwing with him.\n\nExcept for maybe the laser dance, it's my favourite scene in the movie.",

As someone who lives by the sea in similar environment I know how scary it can suddenly become next to a sea wall in a storm. This remains my favourite Comic Strip scene ever.

    "postText": "Tl;dr: I'm curious if anyone can articulate why there is a line somewhere around the mid 80's between movies that look modern and movies that look old.  \n\nMy wife and I just rewatched Jaw. Something I noticed that I have noticed before is that there is something about the quality of movie making that changed at some point between the 70's and mid 80's. But I can't quite put my finger on what it was. \n\nI know some of it was technical advances in sound - both mic technology and capture devices. And I know there were improvements in the quality of cameras and lenses, as well as post  production equipment. \n\nBeyond the technology, it also seems like there were changes to writing and how background cast was used.",

            "comment": "As for improvement in technology, it was actually movies like Jaws and Star Wars that started the process of crafting effects and visuals into the films \n\nAlso, Once Star Wars came out the \u201csummer blockbuster\u201d was the new model so a lot of movies in the 1980s have a run time of about 95-105 mins (hardly ever hitting 2 hours).  This was because there were no multiplexes so you only had 4-6 screens going and theaters needed to churn audiences (think of a lunch counter restaurant model) quickly with ad many showings as possible each day \n\nThat\u2019s why you really get into the plot quickly in those films",

It basically tracks how producers after the prestige era of the 70s prioritized content that would have been considered B'movie grade material and turned it into financial gold by throwing cash and bankable stars at it.",

Think of the difference between the forties and the fifties and then the seventies and the eighties.\n\nSending your youth to be killed overseas tends to darken the mood of the nation but also improves the quality of the art as the stakes are much higher.\n\nThe nineties and 2000s are different because home video allowed producers to greenlight everything.  It was a glorious time for film because you could come up with almost any idea and they'd do it because they'd make the money back on VHS and DVD.\n\nPolitical correctness and greed has destroyed most filmmaking over the last ten years.  And I'm saying this from the perspective of a liberal.  You just can't take any chances artistically anymore or you might destroy your career or legacy.",

It was the last time Americans were getting killed in a war in large volume.  Kids would wear bracelets with the names of missing and dead relatives at school.\n\nAlso the mindset of the Greatest generation hung over our culture... the movie The Graduate gives an idea about how uptight and constricted everything was.  You were considered a lunatic for not wanting to pursue a normal career and \"drop out\"... The Beatles haircuts and Elvis's hips were considered subversive.  It was crazy for women to be doctors and lawyers.\n\nThe demonstrations of 1968, the civil rights movement, all these things changed society in a profound way, and I think that is reflected in the music and art.  The Hays code was relaxed around '66 and the MPAA ratings code was introduced so parents had no idea what they were taking their kids to watch half the time.\n\nIf you were a kid in the seventies, you'd see all kinds of crazy shit because there wasn't all this helicopter parenting yet... kids would ride their bikes to the malls when they were like ten years old and buy tickets to PG movies and go watch R movies instead.\n\nI saw the movie Wise Blood by John Huston a week ago... that movie couldn't be made today... I doubt it could be made in the late eighties even though it was made in 1979.  It's a beautiful film that captures an era and place but it is about something very unmarketable and deeply racist.  But that's how it was in that area and society has sanitized our news from war, and demands our art deal with racism by acting like it never happened or still doesn't exist other than a very simplistic template about how one group is evil and everyone is fucked by them.",

But they don't hold up the same way for me.  The guy is always An Officer and a Gentleman or driving his blue-collar woman around in a sportscar.  There's a change that I think of as very \"Morning in America.\"",

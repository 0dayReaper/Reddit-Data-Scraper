Nowadays they are few in Between.  \n\nIn last couple of years..Kingsman 2 &amp; the dark tower had that type of fight scenes.(matrix resurrection to some degree but u don't talk about it)\n\n\nAny fairly recent movies has that type of throwback action.(last 5/6 years) \n\nDoesn\u2019t matter if its a low budget film or international films",

    "postText": "Pixar have been going through rough times lately Onward was bit of a flop due to the Pandemic, Soul, Luca and Turning Red didn't released in theaters due to the pandemic, and Lightyear the big theatrical return since 2020 flopped at the box office. Now, Elemental seems to be looking not too good in terms of the projections which is $35+ Million Domestically at the box office, and it releasing around the same time as the Flash and Spider Verse yikes. Elio is also probably not gonna do great since it releases around the time of other big films such as Beyond The Spider Verse, Kung Fu Panda 4, Godzilla X Kong unless Beyond The Spider Verse, Kung Fu Panda 4 gets delayed then maybe it has a better chance, but Inside Out 2 is the only film from Pixar that I could be see as a comeback for Disney and Pixar at the Box Office since it's a sequel to a hit movie, and so with it being a sequel to a hit film, it will make people want to go see it, but what do you think?",

People liked Inside Out and with it being one of the last original Pixar movies, it'll probably do well.\n\nI doubt it'd be a \"comeback\" tho, if you mean it in terms of massive success. More like a reliable hit.",

This partnership continued for several years, with Disney distributing Pixar's movies, including \"A Bug's Life\" (1998), \"Toy Story 2\" (1999), \"Monsters, Inc.\" (2001), \"Finding Nemo\" (2003), and others.*\r  \n\r  \n*In 2006, Disney and Pixar announced a merger agreement, with Disney acquiring Pixar Animation Studios. This merger resulted in closer collaboration between the two companies and made Pixar a subsidiary of Disney. Since then, all Pixar movies have been released under the Disney/Pixar banner.*\r  \n\r  \n*So, while Disney has been involved in the distribution and marketing of most Pixar movies, they were not involved in every Pixar movie from the beginning. However, after the merger, Disney's involvement in Pixar's movies became more extensive.*",

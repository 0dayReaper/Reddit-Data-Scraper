They were all super funny, but Jerry Stiller on his own could have you unable to breathe from laughing so hard.  He really hearkened back to all that old Carol Burnett/Don Rickles/Johnny Carson/etc. era of comedy.",

                                    "comment": "I always felt that IASIP was more \"White Trash Cheers\" than anything else. It's centered around a cast of characters in a bar with a narcasistic Playboy (Sam and Dennis), awkward woman struggling to succeed at *something* (Rebecca and Dee), a loveable doofus (Charlie and Coach), a naive doofus (Mac and Woody), and finally an out-of-work corporate business type and his overly-confident know-it-all best friend with mommy issues are rolled into one character (Frank and Norm/Cliff).\n\nPlus if you rewatch Cheers you kinda realize all of those characters are actually selfish dicks in their own ways. IASIP just turned it up to 11.\n\nEdit: You know, now that I'm a bit more awake I see A LOT of Cliff in Mac more than Frank. There's even an episode where Cliff tries to convince the bar he's a black belt who's hands are registered as deadly weapons. Both are slaves to their own delusions and pretend to always have the answers to everything.\n\nI think Frank is closer to Carla (coincidentally, as the actors are married). They're both crass sleezy scheming sex-obsessed monsters who love to get weird with it. \n\nAs mentioned below Cricket is Fraiser.\n\nWho would be Diane? Probably the Waitress haha. She's the lovesick obsession of another main character, literally also *a waitress*, and she may not exactly be a Rhodes scholar but next to The Gang she looks like Gertrude Stein.\n\n The McPoyle's are Gary.",

Then just woke up (annoyingly), and can\u2019t fall back asleep again right away, so came to reddit of course.\n\nThis is the first story I see...\n\nSeinfeld is and was my favourite show growing up.  Jerry was a huge part of why the show was so great.  \n\nThen of course he was amazing on king of queens as well.\n\nYears ago I read his autobiography, and he talked about his years in show biz and the love of his life Anne Meara.  His story always stuck with me, and I still think of it from time to time when I see him on tv\n\nJerry you were one of the greats, I will miss you, yet I will continue to see you and enjoy you as a performer, almost everyday in the reruns.\n\nAnne will be there when you arrive Jerry.",

Thank you for every laugh you gave me, I think after watching you all of these years a part of your personality lives inside of me, I will do what I can to keep you spirit alive. Next year's festivus will be celebrated in your honor. \n\n92 is a great age to leave this world at, if we're wrong and there's an afterlife, I hope you are able to find rest and relaxation, you deserve it. Thanks for the great memories, you will be on my mind often. Please go into the next life with the knowledge that your children have figured things out for themselves, and someday you will be together again. Everyone will miss you Jerry, but I know you already know that.",

He was really good in Seinfeld \u2014 which is on mute right now, so that I can read \u2014 but I think that he was even better as Arthur in King of Queens. He was perfect.\n\nThe man was a comedic wonder.\n\nRest In Peace, sir. Thanks for the many laughs, and condolences to your family.",

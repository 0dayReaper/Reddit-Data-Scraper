    "postText": "I settled down last night to watch a late night film. Usually I like to watch an action film but came across Once Were Warriors. I had heard of the movie before and heard it was amazing, but I did not know the plot nor what to expect.\n\nThose 2 hours were the most powerful two hours of film I have ever watched. It was the first film I have openly cried while watching.\n\nFor those unaware, it is about a Maori family living in public housing in Auckland, NZ and deals with issues such as gangs, sex and domestic violence. Some of the scenes portraying this is very confronting, very shocking, but I feel like it had to be done to relay the seriousness of these topics to viewers.\n\nI will not ruin the story for anybody but this has to be mandatory filming for everybody that enjoys cinema. At the end of the film, I just sat there contemplating what I watched and then went to bed, spending another hour or two again just contemplating. Today I spoke to my wife about it. I understand there is a sequel that follows on from the movie and I've yet to watch it, but I don't think I'll rush into it yet so I can continue to bask in wonder at what I feel is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen and highly recommend you all do too.\n\n[TRAILER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0-Q3ChKcfE)",

Not the everyday violence. Not the poverty. Not watching his kids spiral into the same way of life. But the fact that someone \"handled\" him is what rocks his world. Like, he can deal with all the shit going on in his life so long as he get to call himself the boss, but take one beating and suddenly its not ok anymore.\n\nThat and him going off-chops about the amount of prawns in his take-away chinese.",

Everytime he drank he was a fun drunk and everyone loved him, but there was always an invisible line someone would cross and the mood would change, he'd become abusive.\nHe was also a horrible drunk and continued the cycle. I no longer speak to him as he's still horrible, abusive and lonely, and everyone is wrong except him. He still haunts out parents, calls them occasionally when drunk, yells abuse at them and makes threats. He's next level, and still idolises Jake.",

No knights in shining armor, no action stars, nothing.\n\nGrowing up, we had Jake the Muss. It was cool seeing him beat up people in the bar. People who were usually A-holes anyway, but Jake was no better, or even worse than them.\n\nOnce Were Warriors is a fantastic story about abuse, struggles, culture(modern and traditional), and detachment. While highly recommended, don't just stop there. This movie did a lot that hurt Maori people.\n\nI'm sorry for being preachy, but for a long time there was very little representation in media for Maori. The major films involving Maori culture were Utu(about British and Maori War), and this, Once Were Warriors.\n\nOne of my favorite films that I would like to also recommend is called '[White Lies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prcx70v-H6w)'.\n\nIt's about a Medicine Woman who is hired by a European Mistress to help her heal her fragile body through a pregnancy, as all others had failed. This occurs around the time that Maori medicine practices are made illegal, so she needs to be very hush-hush over it.\n\nThis movie taught me quite a bit. There's a scene near the start that was quite beautiful, and according to my Aunty, word for word what they're taught about Maori birthing rituals.\n\nWhite Lies is also quite a raw film. Not quite the same way as Once Were Warriors, but when you watch it you will feel that tension and anxiety as it progresses on.\n\nAgain, apologies for the preaching. It's just that I wish we had films and media representation that we have now, back when I was a kid.",

It was showing how badass Jake the Muss was and that's what people back then strongly resonated with, and embraced.\n\nJake the Muss, Buck Shelford, and Jonah Lomu were among the most talked about heroes of our time during the 90's and 00's. Of cause the Hopoate, Inga the Winger, Zinzan Brooke, Rokocoko, etc. All had moves named after them in in school.\n\nThe Jake the Muss move was the second least polite one, which is basically a bash. The Hopoate was replaced years later by '1,000 years of Death' from Naruto. In case anyone else reading needs a reference to what 'doing a Hopoate' entails.\n\n&gt;Embrace that we have more stuff now, but films like Once were Warriors are a big part of the reason why.\n\nTrue, and I do enjoy that film makers are willing to explore more into NZ media, culture, etc. I'd just like to see more Maori in roles that aren't gang-related with those characters being the heroes(Vegas, Shortland Street, Fantail, etc).",

Its clear from his potrayal that hurt causes hurt and the consequences that he experienced as a result.\n\nI would say Jake the Muss is iconic but im not sure whether people looked to him as a hero. Many who struggled through the same thing laughed at the movie and I think it was more so about how confronting it was for their childhoods. Hell, I've grown the same way and laughed at it also.\n\nJonah was a hero for many reasons. I dont think Jake the Muss was up there alongside him. \n\n&gt;. I'd just like to see more Maori in roles that aren't gang-related with those characters being the heroes(Vegas, Shortland Street, Fantail, etc).\n\nIn the 90s Pakeha never wanted to see that. Thats why it wasnt on our screens. The urban migration only happened in the 1950s, many Maori were disconnected at this point and Maori things were still taboo. Noone wanted to invest in our actual culture or our histories. People were happy to see a film which reinforced how savage we are. \n\nLuckily times have changed with the Maori renaissance of the 80s to this day. But its unfair to judge this film against the stuff available today.",

I highly agree with you and I think it is the kind of movie everyone needs to see at least once in their life. In NZ Once Were Warriors is highly revered.While it didnt receive the international acclaim it deserved, it is still celebrated as one of our best ever exports.",

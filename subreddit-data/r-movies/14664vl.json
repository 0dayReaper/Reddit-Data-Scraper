    "postText": "My dream is Tom Cruise. I imagine Tom Cruise as Cliff Booth since the day i've saw Once Upon A Time In Hollywood at the movies. Even Kurt Russel role in Death Proof would suite Tom. Tarantino could easily make a character for him. But i think those two egos can't work together.\n\nBesides Tom, Ryan Gosling would be good in a movie with funny dialogues such as Jackie Brown.",

    "postText": "Jaws (1975)\n\nChild's Play 2 (1990) - this was the only Hard R 18+ slasher movie I ever watched as a kid. I was 11 years old when I watched it it was in the nighttime the movie was on HBO and I watched it from beginning to end. you guys may laugh at me for this but this movie scared me so much I didn't watch it again until I was 19. \n\nToy Story 3 (2010) - the character of Lotso. even to this day I still think he's not just a horrible character but a horrible person. \n\nWreck It Ralph (2012) - Turbo's Reveal scene\n\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) - the reveal of Judge Doom\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) - Voldemort's Resurrection scene and also the part where he taunts Harry and tortures him by putting his finger on his forehead where his scar is.\n\nMonsters Inc. (2001) - the character of Randall Boggs scared me as a kid\n\nStar Wars Return of the Jedi (1983) - The scenes with Emperor Palpatine. especially the scene where he almost tortures Luke to death. \n\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) - the infamous Heart ripping Sacrifice ritual scene. this scene is worse than the face melting scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Temple of Doom was also the movie that created the PG-13 rating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nas a child I was forbidden to watch 18+ R rated movies like Scarface, Whiplash, A Clockwork Orange, The Exorcist, Falling Down, Taxi Driver, Halloween, Deadpool, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained, Drive, The Thing and Inglourious Basterds until I turned 18. and thank god for that.",

Sorry you had to be restricted in what you viewed, some of the greatest films of all time are rated R! But to add to the discussion, as a kid, one scene that always freaked me out unreasonably was Chuckie\u2019s dream sequence from Rugrats in Paris. I remember yelling at my brother to turn it off and then running into the other room so that I wouldn\u2019t have to watch it \ud83d\ude02 I guess the demons freaked me out",

                    "comment": "the reason why Whiplash is an 18+ movie is because of not just the profanity but the scenes where Fletcher is abusing, humiliating and tormenting his students are pretty disturbing to watch. if I had kids I would let them watch some rated R movies but Whiplash I won't let them watch cause I think they would be traumatized seeing J. Jonah Jameson screaming vulgar profanities at people and saying lines like \"if you deliberately sabotage my band I will f### you like a pig!\"",

Kids are vulgar as hell. Can\u2019t be too bothered by curse words, that\u2019s why they feel like they have so much power over you.",

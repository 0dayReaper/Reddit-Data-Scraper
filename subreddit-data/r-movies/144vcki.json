    "postText": "This film has been on my to-do list for a long time. I know it\u2019s a classic, and I\u2019ve seen clips. I actually started it thinking \u201cI\u2019ll watch a bit and a finish it later\u201d but I watched the whole thing. I was sucked in from the first moment to the last. I will say I was very disturbed, but the story telling was exceptional. Christian Bale was also incredibly cast. This film left me feeling a bit disappointed in most of Hollywood lately. It reminded me of the art behind film making. I know I\u2019m way behind the times here but I had a really enjoyably viewing experience and I really want to watch more films with this kind of grittiness. Anyway, I\u2019d give it 5 stars but that\u2019s me. What\u2019s your take?",

Most descriptions are based on some of the most brutal shit known serial killers have done. So you\u2019re basically falling asleep reading this boring description then jolted by some extreme violence. \n\nI didn\u2019t have the stomach for it because I got too many of the references if you know what I mean. Specifically I have second hand PTSD from reading a transcription of the tool box killers, which was one of the references. But if you\u2019re into that stuff I\u2019m sure the book is good.",

If you really pay attention to them, you notice that they are _absurd_.  The clothing he describes would make people look like clowns, the food would be disgusting to eat, many of the facts he spouts about pop culture are wrong, etc.\n\nAnd the really fun part is that you don't know if they are absurd because Bateman is insane, or because everyone else is so obsessed with \"the best\" that they don't care about whether or not it is absurd.",

Bateman will go off on the rambling tangents related to pop culture, coming across like a primo-douchebag.  But when you really listen to what he is saying, you realize that he is _wrong_ about most of it.  He mixes up dates on albums or attributes songs to the wrong artist.  He is so obsessed with having the \"right\" opinions on things that he doesn't actually care if his opinions are right.  His entire persona isn't who he is, but who he is supposed to be.",

Maybe Bateman imagined killing Allen in the apartment, or maybe the real estate agent covered it up because it would hurt the price (and her commission).\n\nThis is better conveyed in the book because all you get are names from an unreliable narrator - you can never trust Bateman is telling you the truth because _he_ doesn't know what the truth is anymore.

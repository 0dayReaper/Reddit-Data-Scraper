Tbh the series lost me after 3, I just didn\u2019t love the more comedic route the series went afterwards. The show was pretty meh to me also. But props to Brad Dourif for doing a killer (heh) job all these years with the role.",

The legacy characters never outstay their welcome and are implemented well, but this is undeniably Nica\u2019s movie. Brad Dourif as always is fantastic as Chucky and is definitely having fun in the role. Plus the ending is a good cliffhanger to lead into the Chucky TV show.\n\n\n\nWorst: Child\u2019s Play 3\n\n\nProbably the most basic paint by numbers slasher you can think of. The only boring Child\u2019s Play movie. The kills are a step down from the first 2, and Andy isn\u2019t as compelling as a protagonist as he was previously. Brad Dourif is still giving it his all as Chucky and the 3rd act in the carnival is a fun set piece that gives us a gnarly Chucky death.",

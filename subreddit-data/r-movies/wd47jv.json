At the same time, when she went with celebrity actors for roles, it was dynamite (Mark Hamill was first cast as the Joker by Romano).",

They could have just had her sing and someone else speak.",

After Mel Blanc retired, there was a huge talent gap and they had to pull in everyone who could read lines in front of a mic. \n\nPixar films that are older than \"most\" redditors have been driven by big name stars, if not a-listers. It's only the disney renaissance and older films that relied on VAs and honestly, I don't need to return to an age like we had 30 years ago. I was 5 then and couldn't drink coffee.\n\nThe Disney Renaissance wasn't without star power. Lion King had Darth Vader and the pretty kid from home improvement. The Murder She Wrote lady was in Beauty and the Beast. Honestly, if you're still alive, chances are your childhood was influenced by cartoon films that had star power in the credits (the incredible mr. limpet? that's gotta cover some age gap ground).",

Again the example being Fred, considering Frank Welker was RIGHT THERE.",

Listen to Steven Pacey read the First Law Trilogy he blows 90% of celebrity voiceovers out of the water.\n\nEdit: I'm gonna elaborate on this cause I have nothing else to do. These are big books with lots of characters but the vast majority of the time you don't even have to wait to hear the dialogue tag to know who's speaking  - cause Pacey's performances are just that distinct from each other - men, women, wizards, drunks, demons, children, etc. He switches between them within the space of a line break, but even within characters he adds nuance. For example, Glokta you can hear coming from a mile away - anyone who has listened to these books knows what I'm talking about. But Pacey has honed his craft to the point he uses a distinctly different voice for when Glokta is thinking something to himself vs when he's saying something out loud to another character. Why? Cause Glokta in the story speaks with a significant slur due to having his teeth knocked out - but of course when he's just thinking to himself in his own head he hears his regular \"real\" voice. I don't think I've ever encountered such a level of care and respect for the source material in any other medium.",

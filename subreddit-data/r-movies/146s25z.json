Shes younger than me, so its likely a generational thing.\n\nMy feeling is that film is a very new medium, historically speaking. As time moves forward, we will begin to see what happens to \u201cclassics\u201d in the same vein as what has happened with literature. Some will become myths (Beowolf), some will become the basis of entire genres (Cervantes, Shakespeare, Twain, Poe), and other massive films will be unceremoniously forgotten (even now, how many people are talking about ET or Grumpier Old Men, 2 of the largest films of the 80\u2019s). \n\nScroll through streaming services, and you will see the litter of cinematic history. Thousands of films that were once popular int their own right and now even film fans scroll by looking for \u201csomething good\u201d. I dont think my childs generation is going to watch Breakfast At Tiffanys or Rambo, but they will certainly watch films based on the stories created their, and likely unknowingly watch reinterations of it.",

Because there's so many being pumped out, dozens more funneled exclusively to whichever streaming service funded them, and advertising being forked into 20 different directions. I don't even mean to miss them anymore. I just forget about them because they get buried. \n\nBut as far as classics go I'm a disgrace. I haven't seen The Deer Hunter, Titanic, Lawrence of Arabia, Ghandi, Amadeus, Godfather II, Gone With the Wind, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, the Thin Man series, North by Northwest, 2001, Schindler's List, or Chinatown just to name a few.",

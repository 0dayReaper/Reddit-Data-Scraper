She had happened to mention it, not remembering the name, I discovered the right title based on her description and then realised it was actually playing at a senior's screening at my most local cinema the following week. I got up early and I took her to the pictures and I was the youngest person there by at least thirty years.\n\nTaking her to see Mrs. Miniver is still one of my favourite memories with her, she passed away about six months later. It makes me happy to see your grandmother loved the movie too, it really is great.",

LSD was first synthesized in 1938, but effects weren't know until 1943 when Hoffman tried some. There was no psychedelic drug culture at the time to have been an inspiration to the artists.  \n\nBut your avant garde comment stands, as this was *not* a normal film.",

Currently has a 6.2 on Rotten Tomatoes. It was probably Universal's attempt at squeezing all the money they could out of those monster films in place of a good movie. \n\nI've seen a few of their monster movies from that era, and a lot of them were legit good horror movies that created elements you still see today (especially Bela Lugosi's Dracula)",

A newsreel, a cartoon, a serial adventure, coming attractions, and then finally the main picture.\n\nIn 1942 she would've seen a newsreel about the war, Bugs Bunny fighting the Japanese, an appeal to buy war bonds, maybe Flash Gordon, and then the movie.",

So low scores are only going to happen when a person thought they would like the movie, go to see it, then are unpleasantly surprised.",

Dancers started off phrase, clapped on the wrong beat, and had footwork that drifted out of time from the music - a product of multiple takes, and editors that either didn'tknow enough, or care enough about fitting the end product to the music as was intended. These were some of the best dancers of their time, and among the greatest swing dancers that ever lived. They deserved better.\n\n&gt; This version has had the timing tweaked to put it back on the correct beat, and various edits to set everything back to using the musical phrasing. I cannot be 100% sure, but my intention and hope is that I've managed to restore it to the way they originally danced it.",

Sitting down for an evening's entertainment was something you did once a week at least. No wonder so many neighborhoods even now still have a small old theater.\n\nNo wonder Hollywood boycotted television when it came out.

Even though I generally positioned myself to be able to escape a situation like that, by the time I realized what was happening, it was over. He hit me doing about 40, and launched me into the car in front of me. \n\nThe accident broke both of my femurs, crushed one of my vertebrae, and gave me compression fractures on 5 other vertebrae. I was wearing a helmet, boots, and gloves, so at least my noggin was ok. About 26 hours of surgery, titanium rods in my femurs, titanium cage for my vertebrae, a month in the hospital/rehab center, and tons of physical therapy. It has caused me lifelong pain and some mobility issues, although I'm only about 10 years out. It'll be interesting to see what things are like as I get to my 60s or 70s.\n\nYou can be the best rider in the world, but all it takes is one person to completely upend your life. Fortunately, I still have mine. Not everyone is so lucky.",

It was actually intended to be a lead-in to a King Kong reboot which also would have been directed by Stephen Sommers. In the late 1990's, an idea for a modern day Kong reboot began making its way through Hollywood Pictures. It was to be a response to the rather poorly received Godzilla by Tri-Star Pictures, which was released that same year. The idea was initially picked up, and Sommers, already attached to the upcoming Mummy reboot, expressed a strong interest in becoming involved with the project. The reboot wound up in \"Development Hell\" and eventually was passed on to other studios, becoming the basis for the 2005 remake by Peter Jackson.",

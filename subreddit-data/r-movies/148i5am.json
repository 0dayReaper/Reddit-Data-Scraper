No marines were left on the ship after deploying, which is an absurd plot contrivance\n\n4. They used armour penetrating ammunition inside a nuclear reactor and had to be reminded that wasn't a good idea by Ripley(wtf lol)\n\n5.

By all rights, there should have been a skeleton crew left onboard the Sulaco, to monitor the mission from afar and to prevent any space pirates from hijacking and stealing their multi billion dollar military space ship.\n\n&gt;The company for some reason put their most unexperienced colonel in charge of recovering their multi-billion dollar investment\n\nActually, this isn't true.  The higher ups at Weyland-Yutani were not using the mission as a means to retrieve xenomorphs for their bioweapons division.  Burke was a low-mid level Weyland-Yutani suit, acting in his own self-serving interests (i.e. assess the situation and attempt to smuggle any potential specimens back through quarantine, should the xenomorphs even exist).  He was banking on claiming exclusive rights in regards to finders fees from the company.",

He's always at his best just being a complete wild card and not delivering what he was expected to deliver.\n\nIf Fede Alvarez wants to give Fox and fans a straight-up Alien movie, let him.

Just anecdotally, but everyone I know who watched Prometheus wanted to know more about the Engineers, so then Ridley Scott confects a \"The audience want more monsters\" narrative in order to drop the steaming turd of Covenant. He essentially shat on the most interesting element of Prometheus, to create a critical and box office flop.",

Apparently before they ordered that change, the scripts had Shaw alive on the planet when the new crew arrived.",

Scott spent years working with several writers and at one point they have done 16 drafts and the studio wouldn't approve any of them. Then the studio approved Alien 5 *without there being a finished script!* Scott wanted to make Prometheus 2 before Alien 5, Fox gave him a list of demands, he made the changes they wanted and the movie immediately went into production. That tells you everything. They just wanted an Alien movie and didn't care if it was good. The sad thing was that making Prometheus 2 into an Alien prequel ruined it, so everyone lost in that scenario.",

He specifically stated he didn't want Xenomorphs to appear, but that by the end of the series it would explain how and why they came to be. I believe Alien Covenant was basically Ridley Scott saying fuck you to audiences and Fox, after everyone at the time was very vocal about an Alien movie not having Xenomorphs.",

The studio forced him to turn that into a direct Alien prequel and kill off Shaw or else they would cancel the movie and make Alien 5 with Blomkamp instead. Scott should have said no and directed Blade Runner 2049 (which he produced and co-wrote) instead, but he chose Alien: Covenant and the rest is history. Even after that, they slashed his budget, butchered his edit of the movie, and even changed the music. Alien: Covenant is *not* the movie Scott wanted to make at all. It's sad.",

The way it reproduces, its desire to kill, its strength and ability, its like nothing we've ever seen before. To me, viewing the alien as some kind of foreign apex predator was scary as hell.\n\nI know some kind of backstory was hinted at with the Engineer in the first one, but what made it frightening to me was this greatly advanced alien race found this life form and was destroyed by it. The whole plot line along with the allegories about creation etc. kind of ruined the mystique for me.\n\nWhat I loved about the Alien creature was how it seemed to be the embodiment of terror. It doesn't just kill you, it violates you, impregnates you against your will, and you die a terrifying and painful death. The scariest part? The alien is an animal, its completely benevolent. Its not doing this for joy or for some belief, its doing this simply because its instinct.",

The only film that bucked that trend was Prometheus, coming in third instead of fifth. And it didn't have \"Alien\" in the title, so a huge swath of the movie-going public was unaware that it was a franchise movie at all. They thought they were buying a ticket to an original Ridley Scott science fiction adventure.\n\nThen the head of Fox changed, ordered Prometheus 2 turn into a direct Alien prequel, and the rest was the lowest-grossing film in the series.\n\nI'm glad this movie is coming out in theaters, but it's not going to make as much as Covenant. Unless Alvarez is working with a very low budget, I don't see this revitalizing the franchise. It's just content using an IP that isn't as valuable as the studios or the fans think it is. It's recognizable but it isn't a big draw, especially at the budget level it needs. They can't crank out sequels for the cost of another Scream or Halloween movie. They can't be satisfied with those kinds of grosses, either. They need to make blockbuster money, and it just isn't sustainable unless they have fresh ideas like Ridley Scott was after. Prometheus was a viable new franchise and Fox screwed it up.",

Artistically, it\u2019s great. As a story, it\u2019s a dumpster fire.\n\nCovenant not only drops the interesting plot hook from Prometheus but requires the characters to be absurdly stupid. Like, comically over the top stupid all the time. And ends with an attempted hard retcon of the entire franchise to be centered around David despite that not being able to work unless he also pulls a time machine out of his ass.\n\nAnd both are riddled with plot holes ranging from the kind of dumb to the breaks the movie level. Example of the latter: We see David get visibly and obviously injured. David explicitly lacks the self repair function that Walter has. Yet the wounds completely vanish in order for him to pose as Walter.",

Prey basically had Naru, her brother, her dog, and the Predator as characters. Yah there are other guys that get killed, but they\u2019re not really explored too much and serve mainly to show how society sees Naru and to get killed in an awesome fashion. Meanwhile Predator\u2019s supporting cast gets some more spotlight and really have some stand out scenes. The fight on the bridge, Mac shaving because he\u2019s so nervous, and the initial attack on the guerilla group really makes the supporting cast stand out imo.",

If you look at it that way, that after Ripley escapes the nostromo she crash lands on the prison planet with an alien on board, that the alien that was hiding left one there before she blew it out the airlock, it makes more sense.\n\nIt's dark, it's grim, and follows the same format of survival against a single alien threat. Watching with that mindset it's a great sequel and follow up to the original and ends Ripley's story well.",

It was the only Alien film ever that made more money than the one before it, and the critics actually liked it, too. But the studio ruined the sequel, Covenant, and even though critics liked it, it still under-performed. It's probably best to leave the Alien franchise alone and follow Prometheus's lead - making original films in the same genre that have sequels planned out from the beginning, and then sticking to that plan. Doing what other horror movies do, and just having the same monster/slasher show up and fight a new cast of people every few years has diminishing returns. Even if they make some money, they are bad films that slowly erode the legacy of the original.",

    "postText": "I just had my second watch of the film. It's still so good and intense. But all I could really think of in the end was how the police chief screwed everyone by not putting surveillance on the first suspect. And then the dad (Jackman) decided to abduct the guy instead of just watch and follow him to see where he'd go. Obviously we'd not have a movie if these things didn't happen, but I really wish they'd have an alternate ending where Gyllenhaal goes to police chief and lays into him about the damn surveillance he was promised.",

She\u2019s the one who decided to keep the girls, but he did the abducting.\n\nOf course, Dano\u2019s mental state greatly complicates things. For legal culpability, he would need to have some understanding of what was happening. Whether he did is one of the movie\u2019s unanswerable questions, but my opinion is that his repeated lying to the police and Keller indicates that he knew something bad was happening.",

I recently rewatched the film and something that stuck with me was the reporting that Dano was reconnected with his original family - which seems like it should be a happy ending but we know he had some involvement in the terrible things that were happening around him. Idk, maybe he paid for his sins after what Jackman did to him.",

But either way, he was present and he interacted with the girls. His cognitive ability is a whole different question of innocence I guess. You take the kids from where they were to another place even if your intent was just to hang out, that's still abduction.",

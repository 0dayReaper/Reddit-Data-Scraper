But I can't remember a villain that was as relaxed and scary as this character. Every time i rewatch I'm intrigued by how charming he is but you also get the sense that he'll kill anybody at the drop of a hat for the Nazis. Just that opening scene sent goosebumps.",

All my life I had seen footage of Hitler yelling speeches and people yelling back at him. He sounds very angry, but it's all in German. I never understood what he said before.\n\nWell, in this documentary, they subtitled him. You can actually hear his speeches and read what he was saying \n\nAnd what he was saying was *almost exactly the same as what all politicians say.* I mean his speeches are well written, but they're practically banal, if you listen to political speeches at all. And that's what I found so terrifying about him in this documentary: he was just a normal person talking to other normal people. Using words like \"inhuman\" or \"monstrous\" to describe the Nazis is not just wrong, it's dangerous, because we have to remember that they were just people. The whole thing could happen again. I guess I probably knew this in principle, intellectually, but seeing this documentary really brought it home to me.\n\nSo that's the scariest villain I've ever seen in a movie",

They are just such a ridiculously evil group that no one can ever come close to them. But that's where the problem is. Equally heinous crimes against humanity constantly happen, but none get the attention we still give to the Nazis. I'm not using the word 'attention' positively here, rather I am concerned that atrocities worldwide do not generate enough interest to form resolute opposition, as people think \"Well, at least they're not Nazis, right?\" even when the only thing standing in the way of replicating industrialized murder is the lack of resources to do so, not the willingness.",

From my reading, there were many Nazis that understood what they were doing was wrong, and many of them had to get intoxicated to carry out the orders. Not many people are built to murder another person, let alone children. Not that I don't subscribe to the \"all it takes is one bad day\" theory, but I think that's what makes a lot of these characters somewhat more frightening. The fact they're okay with and, in some instances , almost *enjoy* what they're doing. While it doesn't exonerate any of them, having to get drunk to \"follow orders\" still at least shows they were human somewhere. But then you have people like Mengele who used to whistle at the selections and volunteered to choose who worked and who went to the gas chambers while others reporting hating it.",

The problem is you're not looking at why you see that.\n\nThe US has the biggest propaganda front on the planet and uses Nazis perpetually to justify also having the biggest military on the planet.\n\nAmericans see videos of Hitler ranting and raving with no subtitles and think he's a maniac because of it. Not saying he wasn't but the Nazis were gone by 1945. It's 2023 and I still hear Americans talking about Nazis on a daily basis because it's so hammered into your guys' media. It's obnoxious.",

Doesn't talk much. But the dude shakes off an Avalanche like it's nothing. \n\nShere Khan in The Jungle Book 2016. \n\nThanos in Avengers IW/EG",

The true knot in general freaked me out especially with the little boy. \n\nAnd I didn't mention Joker because you knew what you were getting the moment you met him. But his borderline excitement for chaos is unmatched lol",

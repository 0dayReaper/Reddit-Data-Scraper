Johnny Depp was also a popular tv star a few years prior but had far better luck and could arguably be among the biggest tv stars-to-movie stars in recent decades.\n\nWhen did that sorta change? Was it in the past decade when tv and film (due to streaming) started to blend and throw out age old thinking for producers/audiences?",

DVD releases of seasons of TV made it more common for people to watch a whole season consecutively and that left more room for the format to be appreciated and respected. From that point a few more dominos fell and gradually doing TV lost the stigma for actors.",

It may not be so much anymore, now that we have \"prestige\" shows and such, but I think generally \"movie stars\" are seen as on a higher level than \"TV stars.\" \n\nAlso, some people want to be in movies. They don't want to act the same role all the time, even if there are different scenarios as in a TV series. I read that Anthony Hopkins said he didn't like stage work, because he didn't want to do the same thing all the time.\n\nI think a lot of actors want to go to movies from TV. Bradley Cooper was on *Alias* (I had no idea) before going on to all his movie fame, as of course was Jennifer Garner. It can happen.\n\n Luke Perry might not have chosen the right projects to jump start a movie career (I only really remember *The Fifth Element,* myself, and he had a small role there). Or, he might have chosen good projects that didn't hit the right note at the time. A lot of success in entertainment is down to luck.\n\nEdit: incorrect movie title",

TV stars were signed to deals with series that might be ongoing like soaps, or 6 month lockdowns for 23 episode seasons like Tom Selleck missing out on Indiana Jones or Pierce Brosnan only eventually becoming Bond because of initially being tied to Remington Steele\n2. TV stars were not anticipated to be able to pull in 100 million plus at the box office as part of a tent pole feature so in theory it was a bigger risk until they'd proven themselves in supporting roles\n3. Perhaps a reason not often thought of: skills and experience on an acting resume.  So many movie actors get parts because of being trained in martial arts, automatic weapons and military training,  horseback riding,  vehicle control etc. Back in the 80s and even 90s, tv show actors would have been less likely to have accumulated these skills,  compared to a motion picture actor. Nowadays, streaming series demand the same skills as movies so there is a lot more potential\n4. Because of the Netflix, HBO and Amazon's of the world, streaming series producers can now afford to pay top dollar compared to the limited budgets of even mainstream tv series of 30 to 40 years ago\n\nAm not saying I'm right about any of these. It might even be a combination of all of these things, and other factors too. Just some stuff to consider",

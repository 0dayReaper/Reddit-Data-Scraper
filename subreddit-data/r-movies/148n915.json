I\u2019m looking for movies that share the same universe or IP but both take a different approach and have a very different tone.  They can be sequels like Alien/Aliens but don\u2019t have to be.  Thanks in advance for your help!  I\u2019m having trouble thinking or a lot.",

Edward Norton was a raging monster in The Incredible Hulk, Mark Ruffalo was a soy boy beta male even before Avengers Endgame. \n\nI\u2019m not being misogynistic or some Andrew Tate groupie, I\u2019m pointing out Hulk had the personality of the Ancient One ever since they replaced him with Ruffalo.",

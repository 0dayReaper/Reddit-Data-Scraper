They are aquatic, and are pretty much like sharks of the bug world.\n\nThen they become dragonflies which are capable of \u201cleading\u201d their targets. They aim for where their prey will be rather than where it is, a feat thought to be impossible by insects. Amazing creatures.\n\nThe Green Darner is particularly fascinating. Like Monarch butterflies, they embark on a multi-generational migration across North America. One generation will migrate North, then a couple generations will pass and the third or so will migrate back down South. They still don\u2019t fully understand how they do this. Truly remarkable animals.",

His role in that is one of my favorite characters in cinema. But then we can go all the way to Rasputin or we can go to Dmitri Karamazov. Dmitri Karamazov is one my favorite characters in literature. I love him so much because he\u2019s so happy and he has no money. He\u2019s just living it up. He spent all his money trying to get the girl. I did the same thing once. I was very Dmitri Karamazov in high school. The most beautiful girl in high school who was a grade older than me invited me to the prom but I had no money. My grandmother gave each of us a little bond. My older brother bought a car. My second oldest brother bought some stereo equipment. And I splashed out on a chauffeur-driven limousine, a tuxedo and a four course meal at Le Dome on Sunset blvd. The car was $2000, the stereo was $2000, and my prom night was $2000 and man, that was money well spent. THAT\u2019s Dmitri Karamazov.",

The dialogue for my character in Willy\u2019s Wonderland was very sparse, so I decided with Kevin, the director, to go full Harpo Marx and take all the dialogue out because I thought that would be a fun acting challenge to see how much I could communicate without words and only with movement and facial expressions. I\u2019m very happy with the results of Willy\u2019s Wonderland. It was a good experiment. \r  \n\r  \n2. The can question is an interesting one, and I hesitate to answer it for you because your relationship with the movie is far more important than my relationship with the movie and so you as the audience member can imagine and surmise whatever you want to be in that can. That is a far better answer and reason for the can than anything I could tell you. I want YOUR opinion as to what was in the can, because that was the right opinion.",

Similarly, if you're literally just being you, like a documentary with no script, or at most something you wrote yourself, like a speech - well then, you're just being you.\n\nBut trying to be something exaggerated and extreme, while *still being you* - gah!

We even made [membership cards](https://imgur.com/a/Wb5rHbv). So, thank you. We even watched an after school special you did and the History of Swearing. \n\nMy question is, there are many segments that are things reported as you just doing as suggestions for a role, such as the jelly bean martini in Ghost Rider. Do you have any small bits you are particularly proud of that you\u2019ve improvised or added in to a character?",

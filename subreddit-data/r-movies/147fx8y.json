It's hard to find these on my own, especially with my level of movie knowledge.\n\nIf you have any recommendations I'd be thankful.\n\nCheers.",

It maintains a pretty consistent thread of tension and anticipation throughout while also being strangely relaxing for most of the movie (apart from the few scenes with overt action/suspense).",

There's a Netflix movie but it doesn't even remotely captures the atmosphere of the manga.",

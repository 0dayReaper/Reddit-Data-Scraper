Fast forward to Shrek 4 and we get the reveal that not only did Fiona save herself from the castle BUT the king and queen of Far Far away are signing away the land to Rumpelstiltskin to save Fiona which was cancelled right when news came of Shrek saving her. If Harold already made a deal with Fairy Godmother, why would he make a deal with Rumpelstiltskin too? Especially if he already knew that Charming would save her? Why didn't Charming ever arrive in that plotline to save Fiona?",

It's also heavily implied that she didn't know the full details of the deal her parents made. She was expecting \"Prince Charming\" (or at least a valiant knight), but she didn't know Charming personally.\n\n&gt;If Harold already made a deal with Fairy Godmother, why would he make a deal with Rumpelstiltskin too? \n\nHarold realized that the Fairy Godmother was a raw deal. As he said in *Shrek 2,* it wasn't his fault that Charming didn't get to Fiona's tower in time.\n\nHe wanted his daughter back, but he also wanted her to be rid of the curse, and he thought Rumpelstiltskin might be able to fix it.\n\n&gt;Why didn't Charming ever arrive in that plotline to save Fiona?\n\nPossibly the Dragon ate him.",

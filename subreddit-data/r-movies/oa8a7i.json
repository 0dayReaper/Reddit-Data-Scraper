Though, the work place was terribly toxic and draining. There were so many long term employees that endured the atmosphere due to the low cost of healthcare - which, of course, the company touted as a \"benefit\" without accounting for the fact employees had to endure a shit show on a daily basis.\n\nIn addition, I currently work with someone who came into a not insignificant inheritance (i.e. he doesn't really have to work if he doesn't wish to). He continues to work only for the health care benefits. Because, otherwise, he'd be destitute if he had to choose from the \"free market\". \n\nI realize these examples probably seem anecdotal; however, I imagine there are a lot of people in similar situations.",

They deemed hands not necessary for living and decided they wouldn't pay. Insurance companies are the absolute scum of the earth. It's despicable they can profit off of people's misery, while accepting payment for a service that they then do literally everything in their power to avoid providing.\n\nThat's why I only vote for candidates that will take us closer to M4A.

My life is literally in the hands of someone I've never met who is profiting off of my illness. I'm just a statistic the pharmaceutical companies can wave around to show how \"caring\" they are. \n\nOh and my parents.... my wonderful parents whom i love with all of my heart, watched all of this go on, all of the financial hardship and stress, all of it, and they still have the gall to not only toe that [R] party line, but they love to brag about it. It's hard sometimes to not take it personally, but I've gotten to the point where I just dgaf what they think anymore. It really shakes the foundation of a relationship when one party shows such blatant disregard for the other. Intentionally or not.\n\nEdit: Both parties are for profit schmucks with no intention of making any moves towards a decent healthcare system. Just to be clear.

We elected democrats to every high office in the country, and they still haven't done shit about it.\n\nIt's infuriating and terrifying.",

A few years ago I was taken to hospital in an ambulance after a motorcycle accident, some guy ran a red and ruined my day. I had a snapped left wrist and a concussion.\n It just so happened that while I was on the way to the hospital, a couple other people got in a much worse accident near by, so my surgery got bumped from that evening to the next morning. Then overnight another bad accident happened and my surgery got bumped again. In the end I waited in hospital for four days before I actually had my wrist operated on to be set. It's a good system, but sometimes the wait time is a ball ache.",

Insurers will sometimes not pay for private procedures if the surgery can happen in a reasonable amount of time in the public system. \n\nWhile I entirely sympathise with her situation, it's a privilege not everyone can be afforded, and you can guarantee there will be disadvantaged Maori and Pasifika patients with 8, 9, 10mm aneurysms who will wait uncomplaining for their surgery on the public system. \n\nIf your injury is due to an accident here in NZ, regardless of residency status you are covered by our national mandatory accident insurance scheme ACC, which will pay for your surgery in private if needed, pay you lost wages, provide post injury support etc. If the accident happened overseas though, they won't cover it.",

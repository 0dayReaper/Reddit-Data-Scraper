    "postText": "Hey, I was just wondering what single character scenes everyone thinks are cool, badass, iconic whatever you wanna call it. I\u2019ll start, the two that come to mind immediately are: \u201cYou talkin\u2019 to me?\u201d And the \u2018old time rock and roll\u2019 scene from risky business. I like them because the characters have so much swag, Travis acting like a badass in private, and then Joel dancing as if no one is watching when in fact the audience was watching. I\u2019m thinking of making a movie that just takes place on a day off and I want some ideas of what scenes to reference, I have a few more in mind but I want to know what are your favourites?\n\nEdit: sorry I meant scenes with only one character, not so much cold lines in any scene.",

Description:

The goal of /r/Movies is to provide an inclusive place for discussions and news about films with major releases. Submissions should be for the purpose of informing or initiating a discussion, not just to entertain readers. Read our extensive list of rules for more information on other types of posts like fan-art and self-promotion, or message the moderators if you have any questions.

Rules:

Do Familiarize Yourself With Our Rules.: Our [full list of rules is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_allowed_in_.2Fr.2Fmovies.3F)

/r/Movies is about “Movie News and Discussion of Major Motion Pictures.”

As you can see, our front-page is an aggregate for movie news and discussion. We like to keep it that way.

No Antagonism/Flamewars/Attention Whoring - No Racial/Sexist/Dogwhisteling/Homophobic Slurs: Put quotes in quotes.

Immature 4channery or something that looks like extreme rhetoric - let us know.

Remember: discussion about derogatory/offensive/sensitive issues often leads to unnecessary conflict. Discuss the subject of the thread, not the users. Respect different opinions. Interpret arguments in good faith. Remember: not everyone is using their native language. Don't comment dumb stuff because the girls ain't calling.

No Spam &amp; Self-promotion - Same Source Posts: The site-wide definition of spam is when a user has more than 20% of their submissions coming from one source.

If your username is the same as the website or YT channel you're trying to promote - you will be banned and your website blacklisted. Sharing Letterboxd accounts is not allowed either.

No Image Posts &amp; Memes: Memes are not allowed.

Single images or albums of behind the scene of already released movies are prohibited, as are memes, "movies I like/recommend" and infographics. 

Make a text post if you want to talk about a specific and link the image in there.

Official first looks and posters ARE allowed if they've not been posted before.

No Ambiguous/Misleading/Inaccurate Information or Clickbait in The Submission Title: Any type of submission that doesn't include the actual subject in the submission title. We really don't like 'click to find out' titles.

For upcoming movie news, we take misinformation seriously. "In development" does not mean a movie is coming out. "In talks" or "in negotiations" does not mean "This person is working on this project."

We want actual news; official announcements, not investigative journalism.

No Extraneous Comic Book Movie Submission: Anything that isn't official, hard-lined news about comic book movies/Superhero movies will be removed. No featurettes, fan art, parodies, etc.

That means nothing.

Please read the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/wiki/index#wiki_18._comic_book_movie_information_-_conditionally_prohibited) for further information

No Repost or Discussion Threads of New Releases: [Light 'em up](https://i.imgur.com/JGBcbrY.gif)

This rule also applies if there is an official discussion of the same movie on the front page. Official discussions only apply to new releases.

No Spoilers: Intentional or careless spoiling of a plot, true or false, without a spoiler bar (example &gt;!here!&lt;) can result in a ban.

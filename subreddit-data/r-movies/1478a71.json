    "postText": "\nThese three are often grouped together as the three big original method actors of the 1950's who were iconic and influential and changed film acting forever. Of the three who is your pick for the best actor? and what film do you feel had their best performance?\n\nAlthough the least remembered and talked about of the three (which is ironic considering he made his film debut first in 1948) I strongly feel Montgomery Clift was by far the best. I love the subtlety and depth he brought to all his roles. His Oscar nominated performances in The Search, A Place in the Sun, From Here to Eternity, and Judgment at Nuremberg are some of the most riveting film performances I've ever seen. He went above and beyond when it came to preparing for his acting roles. \n\nSadly Clift was a very troubled person in real life and after years of drug and alcohol abuse that finally took their toll on his body and he died at the age of 45. He was about to film Reflections in A Golden Eye before he died and fittingly Marlon Brando was the actor that replaced him in that role.\nHad he not died prematurely and somehow overcame his addiction problems he would have most likely had a comeback in the 1970's similar to the one Marlon Brando had and been better remembered by the general public. I can't praise him enough and I still hope one day Clift will be considered as iconic and influential as Brando and Dean. \n\nJames Dean is remembered more for being an icon (like Marilyn Monroe) than his film roles which is a shame because his three films were still impressive. He was Oscar nominated for both his first and last screen appearances and both in the lead actor category.\nHe was set to star in Somebody Up There Likes Me and The Left Handed Gun when he died. Paul Newman wound up playing both roles so in a way Dean's death gave Newman his career.\n\nMarlon Brando was arguably the most successful of three because he had a long career and is considered both iconic and revered as a great actor. Both Dean and Clift had talent, but their premature deaths and smaller filmographies prevented them from becoming the type of film legend that Brando became and because of that it's easier to see why Brando was the face of method acting and considered the greatest actor of his generation. His comeback in 1972 with The Godfather cemented his reputation as an acting legend. It's just a shame that Brando stopped caring about acting later on in his career. Regardless all three were extremely talented and have deservingly had countless books written about them.",

                    "comment": "The only one of three that studied with Strasberg was James Dean and it was very briefly. Both Brando and Clift hated Strasberg. The Method actually had multiple teachers with varying interpretations of it. The three big method acting teachers from the 1940's and 1950's were Stella Adler, Lee Strasberg, and Robert Lewis.\n\nStella \u00c0dler taught Marlon Brando. Lee Strasberg taught James Dean. Robert Lewis taught Montgomery Clift. Like Clift Lewis is the most forgotten of the 3 even though he taught Meryl Streep, too. Both Strasberg and Adler have schools named after them that are still going strong in LA and NYC.",

                            "comment": "Basically what I'm getting at is that I don't subscribe to the idea that there are versions of the method because Strasberg's \"method\" is a very specific thing and actors tend to get lumped into the method actor category without consideration.  Just because two cookies look similar doesn't mean are made of the same ingredients. \n\n When people think of \"the method\" they are thinking of Stasberg and emotional memory, Alder dropped that in the mid thirties when studying with Stanislanski in Paris, years before Brando came along, he never studied it.  \n\n\"Method actor\" is a term thrown around too frivolously, it a very specific approach in the craft of acting, an approach that far fewer actors use than we are led to believe.",

No matter how you interpret it that label does still stick to Brando, Clift, and Dean and there is no denying their acting (whatever label you want to put on it) was revolutionary and very different from what other actors had done before. Stella Adler is still considered a method acting teacher in the minds of many people (including teachers at her school who studied with her when she was alive) and even though her approach was very different from Strasberg she is still synonymous with the method and so is Brando. no matter what anyone felt about the label the fact is it has stuck with them for decades so you can't blame anyone for labeling them as such especially since their acting was such a huge departure from their contemporaries.",

So many memories and feelings and thoughts whirl around in my mind, all those amazing performances. Just as soon as I have considered something 20 more ideas sizzle and flash in my mind. \n\nIt can't be done. Not by me. All three are giants with shadows that still linger and voices that still echo. Acting is something so magical that when it happens well I can scarcely comprehend it and just accept it as a whole reality of a person on the screen before me. What is the best reality, I don't know I just play and let happen.",

A long while back Joe Rogan and Hannibal Buress I think we\u2019re talking about Amy Schumer\u2019s show being accused of stealing an idea for a sketch. It was brought up that there are a lot of similar ideas in comedy and it can be hard to be completely original. They said with Key and Peele though they could never be accused of stealing something because all of their skits are so original and creative. And it\u2019s true, all of their skits touched on such unique ideas.",

Not sure about the \"Cop is NOT racist, but actually investigates or at least has an eye open for all those awkward missing black people cases, which is why he wants to get a closer look at Chris' papers.\" theory but I kind of like it. Gives the movie another layer of one where a police department is actually not corrupt or racist and just tries to solve a case off screen. ",

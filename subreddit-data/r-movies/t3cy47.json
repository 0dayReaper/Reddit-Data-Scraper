There is absolutely no winning in that position, everyone hates you either because they didn't vote for you or are disappointed that you didn't do enough even though Congress makes everything nigh impossible to get shit done.  Media is constantly lombasting you.  Decisions made could royally fuck good people over despite your best intentions.  Deciding to sent American troops to risk their lives on some foreign land has to take a toll, too.\n\nThe only true plus I can see is that if you make it early enough, you never have to touch politics again if you don't want to and receive a healthy pension for the rest of your life.",

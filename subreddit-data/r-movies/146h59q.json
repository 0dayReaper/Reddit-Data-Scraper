The filmmakers used live rounds and they actually shot a cow.\n\nThere have been a couple of movies about Operation Anthropoid, most notably *Atent\u00e1t/The Assasination* (1964), *Operation Daybreak* (1972), and *Anthropoid* (2016). All three movies (especially the first and last) have accurate reenactments of the assasination, and the paratroopers' final stand in the church (apart from that, they're also very accurate to the events). Though they use sten guns in the church (in real life, they probably only had pistols).",

Both are GREAT, but too many variables to include.",

Crack and thump happens at the target\u2019s end, not the shooter\u2019s end: BHD has more pov from troops under contact. We have more troops, multiple firing positions, multiple different weapon calibres, different surfaces. The whole movie is an emersion of the chaos of combat.  We have troops trying to locate en, reacting to threats all the time. Heat has a set piece action scene that is top notch tactics, the criminals react text book to threat and show off some good fire and maneuver,  but it happens in a vaccum. A large open street and cars, therefore the claustraphobic element of emersion is not there. Again both are excellent examples of shoot outs, but to limit BHD to a single one is not doing it justise.",

One has narrow one has large, that effects the sound. Talking tactics, kilmer blasts full auto standing with an M4 = zero rounds on target = no suppressive fire (when rounds are such that you cannot continue on your chosen course of action). The cops are out ranged with shotguns and pistols, yt go static and fire. Most troops fight on a 3 to 1 ratio; cops had that, and didnt close the distance. The issue with heat is that, with all movies, the action happens because it has too, no sense of death or fear. With BHD, we get the actual unknown, and that conveys alot more, and the sound is better.",

I believe the sound was also used in the movie with fox and cruise as well in the alley scene. \nWhat is unrealistic about the shoot out is what I said before. The magazines being fired as if they were 100 round drums, the lack of zipp sound , Ricochet sound and impacts. also the m4 used with a flash suppressor his flashing like crazy. It would look like air / gas pushing out. I made examples of movies that created it right. I always catch the basic. 100 being shot on automatic in a 30 round mag. That\u2019s a dead giveaway that it isn\u2019t realistic.",

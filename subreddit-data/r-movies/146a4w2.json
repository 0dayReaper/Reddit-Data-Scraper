It was so weird and unnecessary. I understand that the shot itself is necessary but the need for the nudity is not at all. Is there a genuine reason for it?",

Sometimes directors end up over selling something to really drive home that message to a wide variety of audiences.\n\nWe consider children innocent and clothes signify a sort of corruption of society on that innocence. The director really wants the audience to understand that with her character in that scene.\n\nAt the same time we see the boy watching her. The audience feels like we shouldn't be watching, but he is. He's not part of that innocence, he's hiding from it. \n\nHopefully this makes sense.",

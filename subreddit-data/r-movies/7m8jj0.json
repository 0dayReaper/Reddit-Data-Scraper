I knew I was asked to do this as a favor under the table and never expected a credit. That said, the two people who did the work of building that sculpt were not in the final credits, which I thought was odd. ADI didn\u2019t even include them in their list of uncredited folk, but then again these two may have been contracted outside of that wheel house. I forget the last name of guy who did my cast (it was over a year ago) but Frank and Kelsey Berk deserve recognition for their contributions. ",

I've been in the MU and Creature FX biz for 37 years (I was on the poster for ALIEN NATION, the movie) and I can tell you that Netflix supports their directors like it was 1987. We designed Orcs (along with Chris Nelson) directly with David Ayer and w/o a cc list as long as your arm. That's why when our crew was omitted from the credits we knew it was an unintentional oversight. The producers and Netflix have contacted us with their apologies.\n\nIf you love Practical FX, please see BRIGHT. It's been a long time since we in the Special Makeup community have worked on a film this big, and even longer since we've shot in Los Angeles. We're grateful to Netflix for the opportunity to ply our craft.\n\nI'll be responding to comments - feel free to ask me questions!",

I haven\u2019t felt that immersed in a universe in a very long time. It all felt very grounded, very tangible, very real. \n\nI was looking forward to the movie for awhile, eager to check out the world, the characters and the different creatures, and was SO worried that it\u2019d be a CGI-fest which would\u2019ve turned me off immediately, but you and your team delivered MUCH more than I was hoping for. \n\nI\u2019m sure there was some CGI at play, but practical effects anchored it so well... \n\nNo question, just wanted to say absolutely amazing work, and thank you for taking this opportunity to turn one of the raddest concepts  into a stunning movie with some of the most realistic creature effects I\u2019ve ever seen.

I know a lot of people I went to university with that felt the same way by the time they were finishing school. It would be great if people could be exposed to the good and the bad realities before spending 4 years of time and money on an education for that career path.",

There's a fun, funky, pretty awesome band I know was approached by Disney to use one of their songs for one of the recent Pixar sequels.\n\nDisney negotiated very hard: they convinced the band that having a song in a Pixar movie was really valuable, and so the band agreed to take a relatively small amount of money up front, something like $10k, with the idea being that all the publicity they get from the movie will make up for how little Disney wanted to pay. \n\nWhen the movie came out, turns out Disney had totally forgotten to put the band in the credits. Disney bought the song super-cheap with the promise of fame/exposure, and then 'forgot' to put the band in the credits.",

Im saying you have to treat the mouse like you would treat an illegal crime syndicate, not a typical business.\n\nSay you do go against the mouse.

Disney puts out a statement along the lines of: \"We are sorry to LiamGTR and all the other VFX artist that didn't get credit.We will take steps in the future. \n\nGreat, you think, I made a difference. Next day you find out that your VFX company's contract was just canceled and all its other bids are going nowhere. Everyone in the office looks at you. Layoffs happen (normal for the industry but they always hire you back, except this time). \n\nYou look for work at another house but for some reason, no one seems to want to work with you. You think to yourself, \"is a company as big as Disney really going out of its way to blackball me? I mean all I do is animate hair! I'm a nobody. Is Disney really that petty?\"\n\nThe answer: YES! \n\nDisney will destroy your world and then some. They own half of the Hollywood market share for a reason.

These days they're (we're) a dime a dozen. As it is with VFX. What was once considered mysterious and companies could charge large amounts is now possible by many others (though not nearly as ubiquitous as IT of course) for cheap money.\n\nVFX, like IT, is now one of those baseline things for films. People only really notice when it goes wrong and when it is done correctly, no one notices... think how similar all the big CGI films are these days - avengers, x men, transformers etc. The studios dont seem to care about individual flare or techniques.\n\nIt's also similar to video game companies. Now anyone can go make a flappy bird thing, companies like EA start paying less and less for more and more. And if you dont do it or dont accept that there will be no credit, they just go offshore or to another company that will.\n\nLowest bidder etc. Race to the bottom.",

He quit production after he got tired of sitting around because of studio financial issues.\n\n Peter Jackson absolutely didn't want to direct, but after GDT left, he decided it was either he stepped in to direct or the studio would get some for hire schlub and they'd be just abhorrent. PJ asked the studio to delay the release to give him more pre-production time to retool the films to his personal style and they refused. PJ started production with basically nothing and had to do everything on the fly. It's why you have things like CG orcs, or loads of compositing, they just flat out didn't have the time to do it any other way. There is footage of PJ sitting on set with just the most depressed look and stare on his face because he was so overwhelmed.\n\nFrankly, it's a testament to PJ's immense skill as a filmmaker that the films were even watchable.",

[Credits](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1198059/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1).\n  \nCredits are a touchy issue on all sides. The fact is that it takes a shit-ton of people to create these movies, and the majority of them are in VFX... by far. There's many political and monetary factors that go into credits that people don't realize, but the main one is the fear of unionization.\n  \nCredits are used in deal making. VFX supervisor and producer credits are now featured on their own cards in the beginning of the movie. That's because Hollywood agencies have pushed for them in the past 10 years since VFX department heads are pretty much capped at a $10k a week rate. That sounds like a shit ton of money, but other department heads are capped at that rate due to their union rules. So a cinematographer who's been working in Hollywood since the 80's has probably been making $10k a week since the 90's-00's. Though VFX is not part of a union, the studios know that if they paid their department heads more then the unions would come after them. So veteran VFX supervisors are capped, which means they have to look for other ways to get a good deal, and one of those ways is a credit.\n  \nThis is an elaborate way of saying that credits are part of a struggle within the industry to classify work, workers, pay scale, and most importantly union involvement. If you took all the people who worked on a large movie and gave them a credit, you would see a HUGE difference in the amount of VFX people that put their hands on the film. This would tip off the unions to say wait a second, how much power do we really have over collective bargaining if 40% of the movie is done in VFX? That would drive unions harder to go after a VFX union because that amount of non-union people could affect their bargaining power. Like I mentioned above, the deals that VFX people make can affect the deals that the non-VFX people make.\n  \nAlso, movies have always been skewed toward the production phase. You could be a PA on a film for the production and get a credit, but a PA in post production might not. That's from a 100 year old culture within the film industry that cherishes the set life. Post production is just a bunch of nerds putting the film together. But what we're seeing is a shift from a three part system (pre, during, post), to a one part system. Post production teams are being assembled even before shooting begins, because they have to cut animatics, previs, and rough assemblies of the footage. As a VFX production person myself I have to be on during all three phases, even though 90% of our work is done in post, and we start asset building and postvis right out of the camera gate. Hollywood has not caught up to this line of thinking. That the film set is only shooting 60% of your movie, the other 40% is done in VFX. So we're no longer \"visual effects\" but \"digital production\".\n  \nSo it's a classic case of Hollywood wanting its cake and eating it too. They want the magic that VFX affords them, but they don't want to pay for it or give it proper credit, or even a union. The main attitude of Hollywood is \"you're privileged just to work here\". That's how it gets away with everything from fucking over VFX companies to fucking their assistants. It's the unions who go \"fuck you, pay us\", but right now the VFX industry is being led by old men who don't want to ruffle the feathers of Hollywood, and their own standing in the industry, and refuse to form a coalition to fight this. (I'm looking at you, VES). But the more dependent they are on VFX, the more people, in every country, is going to get sick of it and finally unionize.",

Really it just made credits more useless and people less likely to read them though as they grew.",

Additionally, Magic itself is much more common in the *Shadowrun* setting than in the *Bright* universe, as the spells demonstrated in the movie would have equivalents that any Street Shaman or Spell Chucker in the Shadows could do in his sleep.\n\nPersonally, I'd love to see a *Shadowrun* series on Netflix - because I don't think you could do it any other way *than* a series on Netflix, too much too unpack plot-wise.

It's very similar in a lot of ways, though - elves rule the world as rich elites because they're elves, humans are just sort of everywheres, and orcs tend to be shoved into ghettos. Magic's extremely rare, with maybe one in a million humans being able to use it.\n\n*As an edit, because I forgot the first time; Dragonfall is great, Hong Kong has an even more polished setup - though I think I prefer Dragonfall's story and setting more. The original Shadowrun Returns isn't too bad either, really, though it was more a proof of concept and Deadman's Switch isn't particularly lengthy.*",

A lot of movies by the big studios don't give their audience this much credit. \n\nI have a few ideas on how I think they could have made the movie stronger, but it seems like there was less dumbing down for the general audience than most fantasy movies, and that's a positive step.",

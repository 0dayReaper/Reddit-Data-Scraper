    "postText": "For me it\u2019s Reservoir Dogs. So much chemistry and banter in one scene, really sets the mood for the rest of the film. Some close contenders, in no particular order:\n\n-Inglorious Bastards: it\u2019s really 1B for me. Ask me at any given day I think it\u2019s between this and Reservoir Dogs\n\n-Full Metal Jacket: really creative way to show character development in a callous yet quick fashion\n\n-Dark Knight: starts the wheel that is this movie at the perfect speed\n\n-The Prestige: throws you right in to the universe wondering who\u2019s fucking with who right away. Gives me chills every time\n\n-Moneyball: I\u2019m a sucker for baseball movies so this is definitely biased, but I thought it was extremely well done and set the tone perfectly\n\nThere\u2019s so many others that I\u2019m probably leaving out. Some honorable mentions are Saving Private Ryan, Jaws, Social Network, There Will Be Blood, Drive, Apocalypse Now, Children of Men, and Touch of Evil",

Started the picture and told the kids we were gonna share a cigarette in the backyard real quick. \n\nWe're at the end of our smoke, my husband says, 'Damn, guess they were ready'. Just then, the back doors fly open so hard and my oldest and youngest ran out SCREAMING their lungs out. They were not ready. \n\nWe talked about how it is just a movie. Just pretend. Said we were sorry if they were scared, told them that is the fun of scary films. Asked  if they wanted us to sit with them thru the picture. Youngest said yeah, she'd  do it with a grown-up. Oldest dipped out. \n\nMy oldest didn't/wouldn't even TOUCH a pair of roller skates after that for almost two years. Kid is a grown-up full-ass human and still doesn't watch scary movies. \n\nWhen we first saw Modern Family, he didn't understand why we all called Phil, 'The Boat Guy'. \n\nHe still won't watch DotD, or any other scary film.",

The woman felt only a wave of pressure that seemed to lift her up in the water and ease her down again. She stopped swimming and held her breath. Feeling nothing further, she resumed her lurching stroke. The fish smelled her now, and the vibrations - erratic and sharp - signalled distress. The fish began to circle close to the surface. It's dorsal fin broke water, and its tail, thrashing back and forth, cut the glassy surface with a hiss. A series of tremors shook it's body. For the first time, the woman felt fear, though she did not know why. Adrenaline shot through her trunk and her limbs, generating a tingling heat and urging her to swim faster...\"",

There's so much tension it's almost unbearable. \n\nThe cold open of Evil Dead Rise is great - the idyllic lakefront scenery and the sense of dread clash in just the right way. And the homage to the original film with the drone camera right as the film opens is wonderful. Everything through the title card is great.",

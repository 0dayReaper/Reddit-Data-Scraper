If it weren't for the few scenes that made me laugh, it would have been terrifying. However the Tally Man song, the shrunken headed dude, the fly screaming \"help me!\" when Beetlejuice first shows up were enough to get me through that movie. Also, and I imagine this was the case for a lot of people my age, that introduction to Tim Burton was most likely what catapulted me into the goth style when I was older. I think I was 11 or 12 when I finally saw Edward Scissorhands and that was the nail in the coffin.",

The thing was the guy was ashamed of it, so he made one stand in the corner and not watch while killing the other one.\n\nIf you catch that, then watch the end you see them come around the wall and see the person standing in the corner, if you remembered the story it\u2019s an \u201coh shit\u201d moment because you realize someone\u2019s about to kill you.",

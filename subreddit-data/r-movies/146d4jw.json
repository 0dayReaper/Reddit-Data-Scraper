    "postText": "I don't mind of they make it honestly, if they give him a voice I hope it's a voice close to the sound of his grunt's at least? or something reflective on the age of the character itself.  But the fact that they said that it's \"impossible for the lead role to not speak in the whole movie\".\n\npleeease..... that IS A LIE, I watched &lt;fools paradise&gt; recently (funny btw xD) the lead role didn't speak at all until the end just to say \"I love you\" to his friend who was extremely sad. same can happen with link. I truly hope they make it or have help from the studio that makes the story board of the game to make it memorable the movie :3 \n\nI wanna know peeps thoughts on the idea too!",

Which is really satisfying to play, and would be really boring to watch. Especially since there is no way they would be able to script the dungeon crawling elements nearly as cleverly as the puzzles are shown in the game. I think people just want to lust after a live action Link. Which \u2026 okay\u2026 I get it. \n\nAnd I\u2019m going to add an example of why I don\u2019t think it could work. The most recent Tomb Raider movie tried so hard to convert \u201csolving video game puzzles\u201d into a movie. And holy god damn that movie was boring. It also made Lara seem really stupid.",

But doing so would leave open a slot that Illumination can't fill with a popular celebrity and would require actual writing talent to pull off, so they won't go for it. I would bet serious money on Tom Holland or Timothy Chalamet being cast given they're two popular, attractive, young guys that will drum up publicity.",

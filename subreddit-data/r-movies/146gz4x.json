    "postText": "Most dramas I've watched are painfully boring. BEST example being Parasite. Another example: Where The Crawdads Sing. Last night I watched Stillwater and hated it. However, these films are highly rated and even critically acclaimed. I guess being critically acclaimed doesn't matter though, because most critics have shit taste for the most part anyways.\n\nWhenever I look up a movie to watch on Google, or Reddit, people's lists aaalways consist mainly of dramas. It's frustrating. And as soon as I see that their number one is something like, for example, Parasite (or an equally boring drama), I immediately think \"well, this list is bunk\". Even most psychological thrillers include HEAVY drama aspects. For example, Nocturnal Animals. God what a stupid movie...\n\nHow do people get into these movies where nothing really happens?",

I LOVE MARVEL and plenty of other stuff that doesn\u2019t fall under the \u201cdrama\u201d scope. However I usually find when the two are mixed together the best stories are told. \n\nBut from your perspective you seem to not really want to see a dramatic dialogue driven film and that\u2019s fine. There\u2019s plenty of genres. But I think the relatability and rawness of these \u201cdramas\u201d are what make them such a covet. Like Parasite is an excellent story of class and greed and so forth.",

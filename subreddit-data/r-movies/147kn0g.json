    "postText": "I'll start by mentioning the original Avatar movie. I enjoyed it in the theater. When it came out on blu-ray, I rewatched it and though it was noticeably worse. A lot of CGI scenes went on longer than in the theatrical cut, and they were no longer impressive but looked like generic video game graphics.\n\nBut the worst part was that many of the extra scenes were poorly integrated into the movie. It's especially jarring in the final act. In the theatrical cut it has a nice, gradual buildup of tension. In the extended version there were several points during that buildup where the movie just cuts to a calm, quiet scene, and then abruptly jumps right back to where it was. It felt really jarring.\n\nI re-watched it for the third time recently, this time I found a theatrical cut on bluray, and it's just so much better.\n\nAny other examples of movies where a later version of the movie was worse than the theatrical cut?",

I can definitely see why Coppola would have wanted them in there.\n\nBut they just don't belong in the movie. Maybe a little beat here or there, but as a whole both of the two longer cuts he had presented over the years are inferior to the theatrical cut.\n\nDishonourable mentions to the films of Sergio Leone: the shorter American version of The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is much better than Leone's unabridged cut which aired in his homeland of Italy and is now presented as the \"director's cut.\" Likewise, the \"extended\", four-hour cut of Once Upon a Time in America is dreadful, and not only because the added scenes are restored from dupes and have all the picture quality of a VHS tape.",

In Apocalypse Now for instance, the Col Kilgore scene on the beach is clunky and unimpactful in the extended version.  The theatrical version was emotional and poignant.\nAnd as far as Good Bad and Ugly, the sound had been lost so two actors about forty five years older than they had been over-dubbed their old dialog and sounded like two actors who were 45 years too old for the part.  And the added scenes added nothing; there's a reason why directors cut scenes.",

The Donner Cut is an interesting mixture of deleted scenes and a cool \u201cwhat if this movie got finished\u201d kind of look that makes for a cool experience\u2026 but it\u2019s actually not a good movie in of itself.\n\nYeah, it takes out the sillier scenes of the Lester cut, but it\u2019s a mess pacing-wise. And the turn back time ending that undoes the entire movie is actually worse than the mind erasing kiss as it makes everything that happens after Superman gains back his powers pointless (why didn\u2019t Superman just turn back time the moment he regained his powers instead of wasting effort on fighting Zod and the gang in Metropolis and the fortress?).\n\nIt also makes Clark look like a terrible character as he goes back to the diner to beat up Rocky, who now should have no memory of their previous encounter and thus has no idea why this random guy comes over to pick a fight with him.",

And 95% of the scenes added in the Extended Cuts are absolutely marvellous stuff, especially for an old reader like myself.\n\nBut the theatrical editions are just the better movies. A lot can be lost by inserting scenes inbetween scenes that go well together. A lot of the power that these movies had in \u201801-\u201803 is lost in the EE. A lot of important moments, while still there, feel less important. For example, all the new Lothl\u00f3rien stuff is great, but carrying the weight of Moria and Gandalf\u2019s fall quickly into the last act of the story is far greater. \n\nThe EE are fantastic for a rewatch, for a comfort watch, for an *event* watch. But as a journey, as a movie experience, as something that has a certain drive and narrative finesse, as something that is always much more keenly aware of where the audience is in terms of emotion and emotional fatigue, the theatrical cuts of LotR are unbeatable.",

This makes the prologue feel more like history and Frodo seem more interested in the world, and it suggests Frodo knows a lot of this stuff already (later shown by his \u201cbut he was destroyed! Sauron was destroyed!\u201d). Also the TC generally sticks closer to Frodo as a main character.\n-\tKeeping the Ring invisibility reveal until the party, which is much better\n-\tnot foreshadowing Evil Bilbo at all\n-\tBoromirs introduction with \u201cIt is a gift!\u201d instead of \u201cIn a dream\u2026\u201d is much, much stronger\n-\tMoria \u2018reduced\u2019 to only the core moments, and a much better Troll fight, that whole set of sequences has a perfect rhythm\n-\tGandalfs death happening at a time when you\u2019re not nearly as fatigued yet, and hitting that much harder\n-\tthat grief being carried into and through L\u00f3rien where we only spend one night instead of three\n-\toverall as much as it pains to lose the gift giving, a phenomenal editing job from \u201cthe dwarf breathes so loud\u2026\u201d (and the alternative Haldir scenes!) all the way to the Argonath. That part of the TC flows so damn well, pun intended, and you\u2019re still so fully in grim adventure mode (and still carrying Gandalf with you) when the Fellowship suddenly breaks\n-\ta tighter end battle that is exactly as long as it should be\n\nI love the fellowship EE the most out of all three and everything it adds is shiny and gold, but man out of all six edits of this trilogy, the Fellowship Theatrical Edition is by far the most expertly edited. When I rewatch it, I am instantly reminded \u201coh shit of course this hit audiences back then like an avalanche!\u201d",

A good example of this is Dumb &amp; Dumber Extended, which is the only version on Blu Ray. The extended cut of D&amp;D takes the film and reinserts a number of scenes that make the duo significantly less likeable. There's a cruelty to the extended cut that undermines the dumb likeability of the theatrical. Even something like the bird having its head torn off goes from a really funny gag to something that just doesn't sit right tonally. It's not funny anymore.\n\nMovies are made or broken in the editing room. I think people sometimes think that a movie needs to have every plot point explained, every character moment included. That's the miracle of editing. Sometimes a film is better without that really cool action scene, or that really cool one-liner that just didn't fit with the flow of the film.",

There's been constant doubt around Ripley's account of what happened and works much better when we don't know what we're in for. \n\nNot knowing Ripley had a daughter doesn't distract from the developing relationship with Newt through the movie at all, and just changes the perspective more to Newt finding a new family. \n\nThe automatic guns in the corridor comes across as something they filmed but never had a complete budget for. It's mainly just close-ups of the guns firing with brief cut-aways to exploding aliens. There's no tension to it for me. \n\nAnd blasphemy, but I don't even like the extra scenery chewing of Bill Paxton on he drop ship. \n\nI think the theatrical cut works perfectly and I still think it's Cameron's best film.",

    "postText": "I rewatched Aftersun last night with a friend and I was struck by some of the more obtuse visuals in the movie. In particular, the long scene towards the beginning where he's out on the balcony smoking a cigarette and swaying... it goes on so long and staring at it, he becomes strangely more fluid and more... shiny? throughout the shot. Idk there's something incredibly eerie about it to me and it looked like CGI. dunno if that's some factor in how it was shot or what. I feel like the other night scenes later don't have that same weird shiny fluid look. Curious if anyone has thoughts/theories?",

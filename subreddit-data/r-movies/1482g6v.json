    "postText": "This is to say nothing of the subsequent movies in the twilight series, I happen to enjoy them all, though the irony tends to get stronger and stronger with each instalment and rises to some kind of peak once Michael Sheen is cackling in the snow.\n\nWe all know how much twilight has been memed over the years, rather too much in my opinion. It\u2019s mostly the result of something of its tone and genre (and quality) hitting the world stage the way it did. However, I would like to stand up and ask any of you who are willing to reconsider the first movie, and in particular, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson.\n\nIf there were two words to describe each performance if you were to ask the general public, they\u2019d be \u2018wooden and twitchy\u2019 for Stewart and \u2018starey and constipated\u2019 for Pattinson.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Kristen Stewart\u2019s Bella. Described in the book as awkward, timid, and serious. More importantly, designed for a reader, specifically a teenage girl, to slot right into her place despite the novel itself being endlessly full of agonising internal monologue.\nI would argue that Kristen Stewart does a very good job of embodying the physical characteristics of the effects of young love on the body. She\u2019s a sighing, exhaling, creaking, muttering, twitching mess, yes, but to me it\u2019s an exceptionally good representation of the heart-fluttering, wavering, butterfly-in-the-stomach kind of feeling you get as a teenager when you fall in love. Perhaps it lacks the dignity some of us might like in our adaptations or our depictions of ourselves, but in its unsubtle way, it\u2019s honest, and I like that.\n\nNow let\u2019s get to Pattinson.\nI\u2019m not going to lie to you, I adore Pattinson\u2019s performance in this movie. No matter how much he says he hated it and didn\u2019t even try, if he didn\u2019t, then he didn\u2019t try in the right way.\nPattinson plays the angsty teenage vampire in a way that\u2019s still pretty unique. He\u2019s not suave, or all that charming. He plays every scene like he\u2019s constipated, yes, but why?\nBecause he\u2019s a vampire! Specifically, a starved vampire. He\u2019s playing every scene with Stewart like he\u2019s trying every waking moment not to literally rip her head off and use her jugular vein as a Capri-sun straw. Because he is! In the famous \u2018stare\u2019 scene in the science class, which people characterise the whole movie as, if you look at the way he\u2019s staring at her, it\u2019s not supposed to be a stare of affection or longing. People just look at it out of context and characterise it as such. He\u2019s staring at her with resentment and hatred because she smells delicious but he cannot kill her. It might not be what you expect from a romantic lead, and it may not be subtle, but again, it\u2019s honest. And to me it seems thought out.\n\nTwilight is not subtle, it\u2019s aggressively directed with a very distinct style that is easily parodied, from the music choices to the constant desaturation and filters making the human girl as pale and deathly as the actual undead people.\nBut that doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing! And I disagree that Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart have had \u2018Renaissances\u2019 because their acting got good. I think they were always promising young actors.",

I haven't seen the movie since it came out, but thinking back on those performances now, it seems pretty clear that they're the product of specific directorial intent of some kind. Doesn't excuse it from criticism, but Twilight was easy to make fun of because the people who made it were kind of already in on the melodrama. For sure.",

And even with the first one, it gets back to that question of \"is something good just because it's self-aware?\" But I think you did a good job of defending the lead performances. Actors tend to get a lot of heat for movies they didn't write or direct.",

I think in twilight there\u2019s a mix of \u2018self-awareness\u2019 and intent. Like, certain things that aren\u2019t accidents but are just stylistic choices, and while it doesn\u2019t disqualify a movie from criticisms, I think it\u2019s more productive to condemn a piece of art on whether it works or not, instead of whether it is doing something or not. It would be like critiquing Wes Anderson on the basis of his aesthetic being too artificial, or Nolan on his films being non-linear. When the intent is that obvious, you can\u2019t just identify a choice and say it\u2019s bad, you need to show why that choice doesn\u2019t work for the intent, or why said intent doesn\u2019t make a good movie.",

If anything, the three leads (including Lautner) are outshone by the supporting cast in the first couple of films.\n\nIt\u2019s only once you get to Eclipse and *especially* Breaking Dawn where you can see them start to have fun with it, really chew the scenery to a degree. That\u2019s when I think they really showed what they could with the material.",

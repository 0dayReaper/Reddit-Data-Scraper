You may know me as Josh Lambert from the INSIDIOUS franchise, and I also starred in Aquaman and the Conjuring films. Yes, all of these were directed by James Wan. I DO work with others...just not as often.  I'm making my directorial debut in INSIDIOUS: THE RED DOOR, in which I also star.\n\nAnd producer James Wan here \u2013 Founder/CEO of Atomic Monster, co-creator of INSIDIOUS and SAW franchises, THE CONJURING Universe, producer of M3GAN, director of AQUAMAN and FURIOUS 7 (among others!). Looking forward to your questions!\n\n**Check out the new trailer for INSIDIOUS: THE RED DOOR, exclusively in theaters July 7th!** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gexw4P68kbg** PROOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gexw4P68kbgPROOF): [https://i.redd.it/y01whe57em4b1.jpg](https://i.redd.it/y01whe57em4b1.jpg)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/539a8j8nku4b1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3e41162332f7d75a57269c077982f89dafe4fccc",

Seeing as how you've now sat in the director's chair, **who would you have cast as the future version of yourself in that show?** (My money's on Craig T Nelson)\n\nHey James!\n\nIt's great to see Atomic Monster optioning great comic titles like *Nocterra*! Besides the titles you've already got in development, **what's your dream comic book adaptation**?",

Because I felt that I'd expanded on the characters I love, and was able to create suspenseful scare scenes and a unique/terrifying villain, the Demon Nun.",

I really loved the first and was instinctively expecting the second to be a let down by comparison, but I absolutely hold them in the same regard.\n\nThe Nun-shadow walking around the room and then out of the painting was absolutely stellar. Plus I don\u2019t think anyone has ever made a spiky tree look so terrifying, that thing haunts my nightmares lol",

I got 3 questions.\n\n1. as film directors do you guys storyboard, don't do storyboard, improvise, make up the shot on the day, rehearse or not rehearse. What is your style of directing when on set ? Do you prefer to be loose or over-prepare?\n2. What's a good way to relieve stress on set?\n3. I always find it scary and lack confidence when I start editing my films or scripts, how can one believe in their project when they sometimes they don't?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers big fan of you guys.",

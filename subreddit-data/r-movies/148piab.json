Plenty of examples throughout history, [This video goes into more detail.](https://youtu.be/He-xViFnvRA)\n\nThese are 2 different storyline and style of filmmaking, but both are R rated animated/cgi stories that follow foul mouth dogs. Not by coincidence. Could be that Tarkovsky had this in his backpocket and decided to go for it now that another studio is making that jump. Or another studio decided that and brought him on for the animation. But definitely I don't think it just boils down to coincidence and 2 movies \"sharing some similarities\".",

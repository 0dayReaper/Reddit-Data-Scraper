I laughed hysterically in the first 15 minutes at how awful, absurd and stupid it was... then I looked over at my mom and she was actually getting her feelings hurt. She was enjoying it. So, I shut up and I suffered silently the rest of the movie. On a positive note, Rebel Wilson as the chonker house cat was the only redeeming part and she was actually hilarious.",

It was probably a whole graduating class of animators on their first gig.\n\nThey spent a couple years getting close in school, getting to know each other and forming bonds. Then they were so happy that most of their class got hired into the same project, it was a dream come true! Things weren't looking so good when they learned their first task around be drawing cat buttholes, but I guess everybody has to pay their dues right?\n\nIt all would have been fine too, if that was the end of it. They would have moved on after making connections in the industry and strengthening their bonds with each other. \n\nBut the reality is: most relationships would go south once you've been tasked with destroying your friends' buttholes. Things were never the same after that.",

The costumes, the dancing, it's everything you can't and shouldn't get out of cinema because of the way suspension of disbelief...works(?).\n\nLion King usurped that because of the even more impressive costumes (and better music). You almost have to go and see it simply on the merit of discovering for yourself what lets you see something that is clearly no attempt at a photorealistic cat (or lion) and yet accept the story as presented. It taps into that imaginitive part of your kid brain.\n\n*War Horse* is a similar example, but even there, while fascinating how the horses move biomechanically true to their live analogues, in doing so, part of that imaginitive aspect is lost (but those puppets are still goddamn incredible).",

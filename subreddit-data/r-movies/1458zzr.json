There are also several shots that were clearly composed with a certain effect in mind and the editing decision was only when to start and end the shot. For example, the way the upward angle shot of Washington \"manspreading\" was taken was from a setup where the camera was on the table. The other angle that existed for that shot was the one from behind Washington looking at Hawke. This means that shot was taken from a different camera setup than the ones where you can see the table.\n\nThey might have ran that whole scene over again with different camera setups, but then that should be the discussion: how the editor switched between multiple runs through of the same scene with different camera setups and stitched different takes together. It's easy enough to see how the framing complements the character dynamic, but this does nothing to discuss what choices the editor was actually making.",

This video is like astrology - just explaining that something is the way it is because it already is like that.\n\nIf Alonso was big - its cuz dominance. If he's small - it's cuz dominance.  Just jamming a triangle into a round hole the whole time.\n\nThe thing no one likes to talk about is how there are 9 angles in big budget films because audiences get fuckin bored too damn easily and sometimes it's an alt angle simply because they felt the need to shake things up and keep them moving.\n\nSometimes a cigar is just a cigar.",

The video is right about how the wide shot of the diner makes Hawke seem alone, but the reason it\u2019s doing that is also because there\u2019s a lull in the conversation. The timing of the silence is important not just to the character dynamic but to the whole scene: how fast are characters speaking, how long do we spend on each shot, etc.\n\nThere\u2019s so much one could talk about in terms of editing choices besides \u201cWashington is larger in the frame\u201d.\n\nAlso, strictly speaking, many of those comments were misplaced because Washington was closer to the camera but we could see less of him, so he was technically occupying roughly the same space in the frame. But then I\u2019m sure the video would say \u201cit\u2019s a duel so they\u2019re the same size\u201d.",

It\u2019s not like 5 cameras are filming one scene all at the same time and you can pick and choose from each. The frame on Denzel with his arms stretched out, the camera would have to be where Ethan is sitting. Now, do they do each scene in its entirety with each camera angle? Then I could see more options in the editing room. Very curious about the process.",

                    "comment": "So I've cut a few features. Nothing A-list with 20 takes and the budget to spend 2 days filming one diner conversation, but the process is largely the same. Coverage wide both ways, coverage close a few ways, then any specialty shots. Then when you're in the editing room it's a matter of *what you want* vs *what performances you got* vs *how clean was the coverage.*\n\nSo while the author of this god-awful video says things about how Alonso is dominant because he's bigger on screen - jesus olivares fucking christ, what a crock of shit. I could show you ten MaStErClAsS scenes where the dominant character is smaller on screen than the other person. They might've gone with the close up because the editor wanted to punch up Alonso's reaction (which is the main fckin point of a close up) or because it's simply the best shot they got of Denzel's performance for that moment.\n\nThere's about a thousand reasons of why someone went with the shot they did, guessing some infallible puppetmaster behind-the-scenes meticulous plan is ridiculous. Instead, the author should talk about why it seems to work, not why they think they did it the way they did. There are plenty of movies with christ allegories of whatever and when fans ask the filmmaker they just shrug and say, \"Yeah I didn't mean that but cool if that's what worked for you.\"\n\nThere is absolutely no, zilche, nada, nothing in any book or film class that says the person on frame who is the largest indicates that they're more dominant. This entire video seems to forget that the actor's performances even exist. THAT is the primary focus for any editor.\n\nedit: lol i never answered your question. So usually the director leaves the editor alone to do what the editor does, cut the scene in the way they think it should be cut, then the director watches it and discusses what they liked, what they didn't, saying \"Give it more of a beat after that line\" or whatever, to punch up or pull back from exactly what the director wants the audience to feel at that moment. The editor does what the director tells them, but the editor offers solutions and the director either picks one or explains it themselves.",

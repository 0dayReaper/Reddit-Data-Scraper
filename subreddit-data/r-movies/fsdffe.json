This week they decided to turn their outside wall &amp; parking lot into a drive-in theater with free screenings &amp; carry-out food for sale. Every ticket through Tuesday has been sold out and the theater is planning on adding additional showtimes to meet demand.",

Indoor rest rooms are available with sanitary and social distancing measures in place. Films begin at dusk and end in time to meet the local area\u2019s 10 p.m. curfew restriction.\n\nReally cool story. Will be interesting to see if this success snowballs into more theaters doing in. The free screenings have been more *Spider-Man: Far From Home* with plans on adding different options soon. They're making money from the food/concessions, delivering to cars.",

The Drive-in I worked at charged 9 dollars for a double feature for every person in the vehicle, and we would usually sell around 2,000 tickets, plus concessions, on the average weekend night. The weekdays were less busy with around 1,000 tickets per night. The craziest times were when kid's movies came out. When Finding Dory premiered we showed it on 3 screens and sold 4,000 tickets, that was the only time we ever had to turn people away for lack of space. One thing to keep in mind was that the theatre I worked at had 5 screens, which is more than most other theaters. I think the biggest issue for most Drive-in theaters is the lack of revenue in the colder months, and the lack of screens (as most only have 1 or 2). Another issue is how much the theaters have to pay to screen the movies, my theatre stopped showing Disney movies as screening them was too expensive and came with too many stipulations from Disney. Personally, I hope that Drive-ins survive because it's fun to sit outside on a summer night and watch a movie under the stars.",

Just look at the United States as multiple policy failures are going to turn this into an unmitigated disaster. You can plan for these things or just just keep blaming people while the disaster unfolds.\n\nFinal Edit: There\u2019s lots of redditors in these threads spouting panic and throwing out unreasonable demands.

I've got another I've been chatting with regularly and I think he's about a week from losing his cool.\n\nPersonally, I'm watching all of this go down and I'm fine (you know that friend of yours that smugly posts that thing about their whole life is social distancing?  Yeah.  Try growing up locked in your room to hide from the bullies in your family).\n\nBut I've also looked into the effects of solitary confinement.  The problems I have now?  Easy peasy compared to people who have been in solitary for long stretches.  \n\nI would call solitary confinement \"cruel and unusual punishment\".  Without question.  \n\nThere's going to be a breaking point for a lot of people who don't see an immediate threat around them.  For better or worse, it's going to hit us very, very soon.  \n\nAnd no, I'm not saying that social distancing is a bad idea and no one should be doing it, but for social creatures who are used to the kind of freedom that allows them to just hug other people...things are going to get very ugly.",

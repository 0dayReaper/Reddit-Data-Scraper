Forty watts is 40 Joules/second, and 1 joule is about 0.74 foot/lbs, so a phased plasma rifle in the 40 watt range is going to be dumping just around 30 ft/lbs of energy into its target.  \n\nThat's about the same energy as a [.22 CB/6mm Flobert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.22_CB).    \n\nNow, a 400 watt phased plasma rifle, you'd really start having something effective.",

The Terminator is my favorite movie of all time, and I regularly engage in this exact conversation.\n\nThat said, it's a lot of things though.  It's action.  It's romance.  It's sci-fi.  These things don't have to be mutually exclusive.\n\nAsk yourself, what is the difference between Arnold's character and any other classic villain like Jason Vorhees or Mike Myers?  The only factor I really see is that one is rooted in science fiction, while the others are rooted in the supernatural.  Why would that be of particular note?\n\nIn all cases you have an unstoppable killing machine that's after you.  The reason Terminator stands head and shoulders above the rest is simply because it has so many other things going for it (mainly the story).  The desperate, overwhelming, helpless feeling of the horror element can get lost in the conversation because of all the other things that make it a masterpiece.",

Most horror films keep a level of uncertainty about what the villain is, or what they want, or how they operate.\n\nIn many ways the Terminator is the main character, we see him arrive, we see him arm up at the gun store, we see how he tracks his victims. Right from the start there is very little uncertainty about what he is or what he wants or how he goes about his business. There is no need for the audience's imagination to fill in the gaps, which is why I will always say that Terminator is a thriller rather than a horror film.\n\nWhile the terminator is certainly scary, its just not in the same way that I am scared of other villains such as in the film Alien, which is also sci-fi but is pure horror that leaves us constantly guessing at what the Alien even is, let alone how it does what it does, or even what it looks like for large parts of the film.\n\nthis is also mirrored in the protagonists, Kyle Reese is time traveling resistance fighter with intricate knowledge about what's going on. The dudes in aliens are just merchant marines more concerned about getting their bonus who have no clue wtf is going on or how to fight it.",

Turning them into bombastic action films kinda ruined what made them truly special in the first place (Don't get me wrong, both sequels are still awesome).",

It could be a cyborg from the future, a creature from the Black Lagoon, it could be a territorial dude in the woods by a summer camp who\u2019s looking for revenge over his mom\u2019s death, or it could be a stalker ex-boyfriend. And the defining factor as to which one you go with is the budget. Lance Henriksen was supposed to be the Terminator, but you get some extra money, you can get Arnold Schwarzenegger.",

You've got this slow moving human shaped thing which is practically impervious to normal damage relentlessly pursuing its target. For all intents and purposes it is as if the Terminator is an undead human, cursed to follow its programming.  \n\nThe Terminator reminds me of the old Universal Mummy films, specifically from The Mummy's Hand (1940) onwards.  \n\nThe first Mummy film, The Mummy (1932) starring Boris Karloff, didn't really feature the Mummy as we commonly think of it today. You can thank the all sequels for that. The original 1932 film is rather different. In fact, the Brendan Fraser films are much closer in both story and tone to The Mummy's Hand (1940) and sequels than the original 1932 film. The Brendan Fraser films borrow much from the Universal films.",

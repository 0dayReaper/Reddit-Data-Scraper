Back in 2012, It was pretty hard to hear Bane speak. What are other movies that you all had problems hearing certain points of dialogue?",

I don\u2019t agree lol. The thing is I watched it at home with headphones on and didn\u2019t really have a hard time hearing the dialogue, but I know people who watched it in cinemas and they said it was hard to hear",

It's pretty standard fair. \n\nWhat makes Tenet different is the editing isn't focused on the vibe. It's not cut like a montage. It's cut like a scene of dialogue.  If you're visually telling the audience they are supposed to be following dialogue but the dialogue is inaudible, then your incredibly expensive boat scene becomes a needless sore point instead of a highlight.",

Those three films are all *very* plot heavy to \u2026 understand the film? Like they\u2019re not an Oppenheimer film that\u2019s biographical. \n\nThey\u2019re very distinctly sci-fi films that require you to follow a plot; or at least specific characters?\n\nAnd dialog is kinda important for that. Unless I\u2019m just crazy and assuming Michael Caine and JGL know what they\u2019re doing between cool action loud scenes?",

The scene with the boats could have easily been a nice montage of boat shots with sporadic bursts of inaudible dialogue. But it isn't edited that way. It's edited like a dialogue scene which is why it was frustrating for the many viewers who couldn't hear the dialogue. \n\n\nPicture the helicopter scene in Arrival where they are all wearing headsets. Now imagine if that scene was mixed to be 'realistic'. Would 10 random shot of Renner and Adams talking inaudibly under the sound of a helicopter really add anything of value to the film? Do you think this conversation adds anything of value to the discourse around Tenet Intentional choice or not, \nthe supposed benefits are far outweighed by the negative reaction caused by it.",

And when Nolan is trying to make an entertaining film, I think whether it was entertaining or not for you is a pretty valid question. And if the sound made the film less enjoyable then its a pretty valid criticism too. \"But that's what he intended\" doesn't suddenly make the film more enjoyable in retrospect.

The A to B of the story supersedes every other formal element of the narrative? I'm guessing you have only seen mega budget studio films, right?

In the past, there was just a dude with a boom mic, holding it up, recording the audio, but NOW everything is shot from ludicrous distances and angles - so the actors have to have a physical microphone on them, which can easily distort audio, through clothing, but also mostly just wavelengths. That's now how sound works or is intended to be interpreted. So now there's \"sound-surgeons\" going in and splicing/adding/extracting/enhancing audio as a full time job, because we haven't figured out how to have both. More video = less audio. Better OG audio = close shots. There's a whole Yin-Yang to it that people still somehow can't figure out.... a super-powerful \"audio-ray\" would solve this issue, but apparently they don't exist outside of spy comics from the 70's. It's a pretty big issue in Hollywood.",

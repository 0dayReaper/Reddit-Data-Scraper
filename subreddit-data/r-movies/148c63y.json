    "postText": "The reason why CINDERELLA is among the best remakes, in my mind the best one yet is the one that tends to be forgotten which I find odd given that it made a lot of money and got great reviews, is because it's its own thing. It's loyal to the source but Kenneth Branagh, the director, made solid changes like it fleshed out the \"wicked stepmother\" as more morally ambiguous and had Cate Blanchett play her and Cinderella, winningly played by Lily James, is charismatic, strong without it being too forced, and engaging. The cast is solid, the movie is very well made, it's a good movie. Today, I dare say they would have kept the talking mice, made it a lot cheesier and had Cinderella be a martial arts fighter on the side. While being a shot by shot remake. \n\nToo many of the Disney remakes are godawful. The Lion King remake claims to be in live action but it still feels animated, MULAN was terrible, ALADDIN was corny and that awful SPEECHLESS song was a absolute torture to go through all summer.",

People will still complain and the movies will still make lots of money.",

Its like people who refuse to watch black and white films for the same reasons. My point is that Disney knows perfectly well the live actions are not original, they want kids today to grow up with a refreshed look on the same beloved story and cash in on another generation of fandom.\n\nThe real test will be in 20 years time when kids grow up and have a chance to look at both versions critically and decide whether the modern ones still deserve any merit despite their inevitable nostalgic attachment to them.",

(At least it seems that way, I suppose snow white is close second.)  Although I thought it was well made, to me, that extra stuff they added with the step mother didn't quite elevate it beyond just another Cinderella story. \n\nBut I would say Cinderella and Jungle Book, which is actually better than the animated one, imo, don't deserve to be lumped into the \"all these Disney remakes are terrible\" narrative. \n\nI will say, I'm a defender of most of these movies, only truly disliking the Lion King. (Disclaimer: I have not seen Pinocchio live action)",

            "comment": "I disagree. \n\nA majority of the remakes do something different. They aren't just shot for shot remakes. It's just hit or miss as to whether it works. \n\nI personally enjoy most of the remakes. With Dumbo, Lion King, and Mulan being the worst of the remakes and its not too close. \n\nCinderella, The Jungle Book, and The Little Mermaid are better than their originals. \n\nI thought Aladdin added a lot to the story. It made Jasmine a better character. Confirming that Jafar was a thief before he became an advisor to the sultan. It added more to Genies and Aladdins friendship. \n\nBeauty and The Beast didn't add a whole lot. But I like what they did with Gaston. By making him more of a threat than his animated counterpart. Beast was given more to do. And anytime we can get more of Dan Steven's singing is fine with me.",

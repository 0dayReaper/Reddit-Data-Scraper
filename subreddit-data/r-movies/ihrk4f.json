You can't say that about many kids cartoons from that era.\n\nI think it's staying power has been in it's ability to change &amp; upgrade for the different generations. I don't particularly like the current version but it's not for  me, it's for today's kids who would probably not be interested in watching Don Knotts &amp; Davy Jones hang with the gang.",

Very similar to the way Don Knotts and Davy Jones showed up in The New Scooby-Doo Movies.",

In fact, they were cel animated, and the pristine transfer, fluid animation, the use of shading made it look very high quality.

Then the actual character dynamics are so broad but play so well, every member of the Scooby gang plays funny with every other member, it\u2019s a 100% perfect group dynamic. It\u2019s very, very, very broad but it is perfect television and it\u2019s ultimately based on an old mans misunderstanding of youth culture. It\u2019s kind of alchemical how this weird combination of cultural misunderstandings spat out such an enduring group of characters.",

Acromegaly, the disease located in the pituitary gland that resulted in his abnormal growth, was his blessing and curse. With the size acromegaly offered, it gave him the potential to become the giant star he ended up being \u2013 unfortunately all that fame and fortune came at a sad reality that he wouldn\u2019t live to make it past 50. Andre tragically died of heart failure on January 27, 1993 in a Paris hotel room, alone, aged 46.\n&gt; \n&gt; Andre had the option to potentially extend his life-span twice but refused on both occasions. The first time was in the early 70s in Japan where it was first discovered that he had acromegaly at the age of 23. He denied the treatment.\n&gt; \n&gt; The second time the opportunity arose to reverse his acromegaly was in the 80s when his health was declining more and he was being treated for an ankle fracture.\n&gt; \n&gt; Andre\u2019s reason not to get operated on?\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cIf this is the size that God wanted me to be, I\u2019m going to be this size.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; One decade later, sadly, Andre died days after his father\u2019s death. He was in France to attend the funeral.\"\n\nThis is only one small part of twelve in the piece. If you find some time, I highly recommend giving [the article](https://prowrestlingstories.com/pro-wrestling-stories/andre-the-giant-documentary/) a read. Some have said it's the best thing they've read all week!\n\nMacho Man Randy Savage's brother Lanny Poffo also dedicated an episode to Andre the Giant this past week too on his recommended *[The Genius Cast podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-genius-cast-with-lanny-poffo)*. It's a heartwarming and hilarious listen, well worth checking out ([iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/5-andre-the-giant/id1434440731?i=1000420802348&amp;mt=2) / [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/41fB6JBCrHEEekkXDZci0v?si=2hhr6QhqSDuvRqFMaxo3cA) as well as all other podcast clients)! Even if you're not a wrestling fan, [The Genius Cast podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-genius-cast-with-lanny-poffo) is worth the subscription alone for the crazy stories about his brother Randy Savage and behind the scenes details on the cartoon world of professional wrestling!",

Once his dad passed, I think he felt like it was ok to let go and let nature take its course.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of conjecture, but that\u2019s how I like to imagine I\u2019d play it out if I were in his shoes.",

He just didn't want to be out of the ring for an extended period of time and felt God made him that way for a reason, so he opted not to do it. A shame.\n\nThe wrestler The Big Show (Paul Wight), on the other hand, [had the procedure reversed](https://prowrestlingstories.com/pro-wrestling-stories/big-show-funniest-stories/). \n\n&gt; From a young age, Show was a medical phenomenon, suffering from acromegaly, a hormonal syndrome which led to [Andre The Giant\u2018s passing in 1993](https://prowrestlingstories.com/pro-wrestling-stories/andre-the-giant-stories/). The condition is responsible for Big Show\u2019s immensity just as it was for Andre\u2019s. The difference is that Big Show stopped the progress of his acromegaly with a successful surgery on his pituitary gland in the early 1990s.\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2011\u2019s WWE \u2018Beyond The Ring\u2019 release, Big Show: A Giant\u2019s World, Show opened up about his condition:\n&gt; \u201cI figure I was about nine when I developed a tumor on my pituitary gland. It\u2019s referred to as acromegaly. I think the statistic is that there are 177 seven-foot kids that graduate from high school each year. I was 6\u20192\u201d at twelve. I really started to get freakishly big at fourteen when I was like 6\u20198\u201d. I was just a machine. I ate about 14,000 calories a day. It was nothing for me in high school to eat four Big Mac\u2019s, two fish sandwiches, two large fries and a large shake and twenty minutes later play a basketball game like nothing was wrong. I was dunking a basketball in eighth grade [and reached 7\u20190\u201d tall in high school].\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Big Show continues, \u201cI realized when I was a freshman in college that I had giantism. It really hit me right in the stomach hard, because I always thought I was just blessed. I never thought of it as an abnormality. I just thought I was just gifted with all this. As a young kid, I didn\u2019t know. I just thought I was just stronger than all the other kids.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Being 7-foot even, the Big Show has a tendency to be an imposing presence. To counter his incredible immensity compared to everyone else, Show has an infectious sense of humor. This is one way he has said to cope with people\u2019s first impression of him. He often does impressions of other wrestlers backstage (on screen as well!) and it was his comedy skills which helped him move into acting. In 2010, he starred in the film Knucklehead. Big Show also appears in the movies The Waterboy and MacGruber. He has also had parts on TV shows such as Royal Pains, Burn Notice, and Psyche as well.",

I remember because he told hogan he'd finished the wine and hogan went \"you finished the whole bottle already!?\" to which Andre replied \"no, the whole case\"\n\nHis drinking was legendary. It took what would make a normal man blackout passed out drunk just to get him a buzz, and the sheer agony he was in every single second of the day meant he drank constantly just to deal with the pain. People aren't meant to be that big with the gravity of earth's, and it gets painful. In the Princess bride, when he catches someone in his arms, he had to wear back braces and the actress has to wear a wire and harness so she wasn't falling into his arms quite as fast and hard. I haven't watched that fm but I believe it was Robin Wright, a small light woman, he had to catch, and this is a guy who's job it was to chuck 250 lb guys around and lift them up on his shoulders every night. But by that point in his life he barely could wrestle any more, and spent most of the time walking around with crutches because normal walking became impossible. \n\nHe was also by all accounts the sweetest most darling and kind man everyone who met him had ever met.",

But he flourished his sword, I pulled out my gun and shot him, and then we went back to England.",

Luckily my parents just had boys, so Olsenmania didn't really reach our household, but my cousins were girls and were totally into it. They had tons of merch, those detective tapes, watched Full House like it was a religion, etc.\n\nMy dad saw this stuff and asked them: \"Where's the third one?\". \"There's only two, they're twins\". \"Don't be silly, there's three. Mary, Kate, and Ashley.\"\n\nAnd in the grand tradition of dad jokes, he fully committed to this bit. For at least a year or two, whenever we'd visit our cousins and the Olsens were on (and the Olsens *would* be on), he'd swear that he could tell whenever they swapped. \"That's Mary...and that's Kate!\". And he concocted this whole plausible sounding (if you're a kid) theory that they used triplets so that one of them could always be resting for child labor purposes (which is the real reason they used twins), but that they legally had to give them all a screen credit, hence why Mary-Kate had two names. My cousins were tearing their hair out in frustration, and eventually stopped playing those tapes whenever we came over (thanks dad!) to avoid the issue.\n\nMuch time passes, and at some point in the 2000s we're having Thanksgiving dinner. During the conversation, one of my cousins mentions how infuriating that whole bit was, and asked my dad if he still insisted there were three Olsen twins. \"No, there are four. Mary, Kate, Ash, and Lee\". He must have been waiting for years to deliver that punchline.\n\nUltimate dad joke.",

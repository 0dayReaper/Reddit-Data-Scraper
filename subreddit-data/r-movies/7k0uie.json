The story set in the far future is a complete narrative in the middle before moving back into the past with the remaining halves of the other stories in reverse chronological order.\n\nHope that makes sense.  But trust me, the structure is easy to follow in the book.",

The stories are arranged like a Matryoshka doll\u2014each story is nestled within its immediate predecessor, so it goes 1-2-3-4-5-6-5-4-3-2-1.\n\nThe result is a feeling like the fall of a rollercoaster throughout the whole second half of the book, as you continue going deeper and deeper into each story as the previous protagonist experiences it for themselves.\n\nSeriously, pick it up if you get a chance. I know it's still early, but I think it's a solid contender for one of the Best Fiction Novels of the 21st Century.",

(The parking garages that they use, for example, are technically owned by the city, but the city barely sees any of the money that they should from garages.) Disney was so upset by this article that they banned the LA Times from reviewer screenings of their movies, meaning that they couldn't write reviews of them. Thankfully, other news organizations stood by the LA Times in solidarity and I think they were told that their movies wouldn't be considered for Academy Awards. They eventually lifted the ban.",

As in her entire job was saying hi to families and taking them to their table and then sitting and waiting for the next one.\n\nShe had no transportation, and therefore had to do all activities and eat almost exclusively through the park. Due to her wages, and the sheer ridiculousness of park pricing, she left the internship almost completely broke. Her housing for her and fellow interns was basically 3rd tier community college dorms (paraphrasing her words). \n\nSpeaking out against well... really anything about your situation or Disney in general would ensure you didn't advance in the company past that level. That's basically because all her fellow employees were cutthroat motherfuckers that would turn on people simply to show their loyalty to the company and shoot down others' chances.\n\n\nShe said that you basically had the option to subject yourself to these degrading conditions for a couple years to maybe advance a few rungs in the hospitality ladder, which help explains the vicious atmosphere between employees. \n\nI wish I was making all this up, and yes, this is a secondhand retelling, but she stood by everything, and said she's terrified of anyone who's subjected themselves to that corporate attitude for so long as to actually rise to the top.\n\nAnyways I got carried away, but yeah Disney ain't so cuddly once you peel away the surface.",

Disney also take on $13.7billion in debt from Fox.\n\nMy question is - How much of Disney will Rupert Murdoch own?\n",

Kasdan just said something like 'you should do your 'vision', george'.\n\nIt felt to me that Kasdan knew very well that Lucas writing would be a trainwreck and let it happen. Maybe to teach a lesson, since he got onboard on Star Wars with JJ.\n\nLucas called Spielberg to direct Phantom Menace, and Spielberg said something like 'star wars is your thing, george'.\n\nSpielberg, when he has a good story, he would cut throats to get it. Directing Star Wars should be exhilarating for him, but said no.\n\nThe old school Star Wars artists didn't want to work with George again. Something gone horribly wrong in the Return of the Jedi production, because even Lucas was fed up with it. Whole teams were dismantled, he had his divorce with Marcia, which helped to develop the series, and Lucas would then only work with agreeable 'brand new talents'. He was never the same afterwards, making bland by-the-book products (Young Indiana Jones was so meh). Like he lost his edge there. \n\nWhen he tried to get the gang back together, they left him high and dry. \n\nThe thing is, you can never build something important alone. Even if you have billions. George is probably a very difficult person.\n\n",

    "postText": "I missed work today cause I was sick, and to kill some time I decided to watch the breakfast club. I knew nothing about the movie, but I\u2019ve heard the name enough that I figured it would be good.\n\nnow I\u2019m no movie expert. I\u2019m not well versed in what makes a movie good or bad. and keep in mind, I\u2019m sick, so my judgement may be at least slightly impaired.\n\ncan I just say, this movie was straight ass. I\u2019m not sure if it was too brilliant for me to comprehend, or just incredibly poorly made. every scene made me more confused. nothing any of the characters did seemed like the behavior of real people. I guess the overall message was positive and good, but every attempt to develop a story was non-coherent.\n\nI\u2019m sitting here baffled at the seemingly astronomical ratings it\u2019s received online. \n\nI\u2019m glad I watched it so that I can cross it off the metaphorical list, but I\u2019m not glad I watched it.\n\nfeel free to attack me if my take is objectively wrong. I\u2019m ready for it.",

A huge part of my late teen years.\n\nThat being said, I rewatched it a few years ago, and aside from the nostalgia factor, it's just okay for me. Still gave me some pleasure because it's a touchstone of my youth but that's about it, really.",

The thing about John Hughes was that even though he was not presenting anything like what my teen life looked like in the 80s, it was all a lot more relatable than what most teen movies were at the time.  Which were horror movies or gross out male gaze comedies like Porky\u2019s.  \n\nI\u2019m Molly Ringwald\u2019s age. And having a girl be the center of so many movies in that era really was a shift in how movies were made and marketed.  It felt new and exciting.  But rewatching The Breakfast Club isn\u2019t nearly as good as watching it the first time was for me.  I\u2019m much more aware of all of the screwed up stuff that was of the time.",

I think maybe Hughes style of comedy perhaps didn\u2019t jive with you? Do you like anything else from him? He dips into nonsensical sometimes.",

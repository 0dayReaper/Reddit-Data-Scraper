It has nothing to do with the person (other than their good decision making). Plus, if I didn't know she was in several other movies I really like (like Columbiana) her 3 highest grossing movies (soon to be top 8 or so) never show me what she actually looks like.  \n\nSamuel Jackson (the highest grossing male) is rarely a lead and he doesn't command the biggest paycheck. He's just in 4-6 movies a year and because he's not an idiot, he's bound to play in a big hit a few times.\n\nA movie made with Sam and Zoe as the leads would probably be really good, but it wouldn't crack the top 100 gross. That's why the highest grossing actor/actress is usually part of more than a few high profile ensembles and doesn't headline more movies.\n\nWhat I am saying it is doesn't directly translate.",

Milius made out like a bandit thanks to his stake in Star Wars though. Also, I believe the movie Spielberg was making at the time was Close Encounters not E.T.",

There were a lot of idiots crowded around guffawing, but anybody with a brain didn't give a shit.\n\nThen Dan Akroyd came in and said with utter seriousness, \"Aliens.\"\n\nEverybody paused for a moment of silent introspection and immediately went back to what they were previously doing. Except for \"Jim\" Cameron, who stroked his chin and said, \"I'm taking Ridley Scott's shit.\" And it was majorly successful so George Lucas stroked his fourth chin and said, \"Yup. Aliens. Also Crystal Skulls.\" And Spielberg was like, \"Whatever, dude. Let's print some more money.\"",

A lot of factors make the Titanic less of a sensitive subject than 9/11.\n\nThe people of the Titanic were not deliberately murdered under shocking circumstances. It also happened over 100 years ago, which means nobody currently alive remembers it happening, nobody is living with the pain of having lost someone in that tragic accident, and nobody saw it or experienced it in any way.\n\n9/11 was shown live on TV. It is still a raw, horrifically disturbing event that affected everyone in the Western World.\n\nThe Titanic movie was a family friendly romanticised film about love and tragedy in a bygone era.",

Titanic happened out of hubris of a man vs nature conflict that could have been avoided. 9/11 was a man vs man tragedy . Like the Hindenburg was a horrible man vs nature conflict that wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to use like the titanic but the Hindenburg wasn\u2019t know to brag about being safe",

Maybe you just didn\u2019t fully explain your thought process?\n\n&gt;\tTitanic happened out of hubris of man vs nature conflict \n\n&gt;\tHindenburg was a horrible man vs nature conflict\n\nIf these are both similar conflicts, why is it ok to dramatise/commercialise the titanic but not the Hindenburg?\n\nPersonally I think the titanic movie is pretty tacky. I probably have a slightly warped perspective because we learn a lot about the titanic disaster at school (in the UK) and I\u2019ve been to the titanic museum with my family (where you can see the names of all 1,500 people who died). \n\nWhat upsets me most about the titanic story is how representative of the UK\u2019s classist society still is today.\n\n61% of the first class passengers survived, compared to only 24% of third class passengers. There were lifeboats to save almost twice as many people as they did save. But poor planning and panic/self-interests took a massive impact.",

The quote that was making its way around does sound pretty dismissive: \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, come on guys, there are other stories to tell besides hyper-gonadal males without families doing death-defying things for two hours and wrecking cities in the process. It\u2019s like, oy!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure this was just an offhand comment that was taken somewhat out of context and blown way out of proportion but I can see how Marvel fans would be annoyed by it. It paints a really dim image of the MCU, particularly considering how much depth the franchise has grown into. Between that, the focus on family in the more recent films, and the growing prominence of female supers in the MCU, it almost sounds like Cameron checked out of the genre a while ago and is just being critical now. \n\nHowever, the rest of the interview doesn\u2019t bear this out. Literally a sentence before this quote, he says he loves the movies, and later on he talks about Guardians of the Galaxy as a great example of escapist sci-fi, compared to something more in the realm of hard sci-fi like Interstellar. And he\u2019s really not wrong that superhero films are taking up a lot of space in today\u2019s industry that could be filled by original stories. The \u201870s and \u201880s, when Cameron was coming up in the industry, were a *fantastic* time for original and outside the box stories. It may be a little ironic coming from the guy who has been working on *4* sequels to what is now a ten year old movie, but he\u2019s been at the top of the box office for 20 years.",

He even helped out a bit with the visuals of the Days of Future Past ending.\n\nEven when Cameron said he wanted Avengers fatigue, he made sure to note that he loves the movies. It honestly seemed like he wanted less of these movies where things just happen and some buff dude saves the day where there\u2019s cheap science or events chalked up to magic just happening. Endgame had none of that. I don\u2019t want to mention spoilers but it felt to me like an Avengers movie made in the style of Claremont\u2019s X-Men. It had everything I would\u2019ve expected.m from a James Cameron movie, even.\n\nI didn\u2019t want The Force Awakens to beat Titanic it Avatar. It didn\u2019t feel earned and it generated a lot of the hate we see toward the movie today when I feel that movie has a lot of relevant lessons to teach us in the years to come about climate change. Same with Infinity Was. But Endgame? It deserves it. I don\u2019t know if it will but I do know that I won\u2019t be happy with any other movie breaking the record.\n\nRespect indeed.",

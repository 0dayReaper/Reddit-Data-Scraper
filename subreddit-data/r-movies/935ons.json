That's like Comcast firing a director on an Illumination film, the literal layers they broke down just to fire Gunn is fucking insane, and honestly I've never seen it done. Even Roseanne got fired by ABC, the company she actually worked for directly. Disney took control from Marvel.\n\nMy guess is Kevin is probably pissed. Very pissed.",

But this was a firing by the people who rubbed elbows with Weinstein, and allowed Kevin Smith's crass \"Clerks\" humor to hit theaters. It's wholly hypocritical. ",

He quickly becomes one of the world's most popular celebrities - even offering insight into our current political climate armed with a unique perspective of multiple eras of human history.\n\nAt the height of his fame, some of his past misdeeds from a primitive era are made public through the discovery of ancient cave drawings.

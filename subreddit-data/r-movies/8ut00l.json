I saw Split, thought the music in the ending sounded familiar and then when Bruce Willis appeared I was just completely shocked. It had an effect on me but it would have been so much better if I saw Unbreakable. Having now seen it, this is a crossover I can really get behind and I look forward to seeing what happens with the characters after we saw the origin of the hero and the villain.",

Night Shyamalan says that Kevin from split was originally supposed to be in unbreakable but he couldn\u2019t figure out a good way to weave his story in or something like that. There\u2019s a few theories out there, like in split Kevin\u2019s dad left on a train, that train was the same one that crashed in the beginning of unbreakable killing everyone except for David Dunn. Another one is that the mom and boy that  David runs into, and senses some abuse from, at the stadium in Unbreakable is Kevin. We\u2019ll see if anything else is revealed when the movie comes out. ",

Both Unbreakable's hero and Split's villain come to full realization of their power in an Amtrak train.\n\nHedwig also said his dad went on a train and never came back, and we also later see Kevin bringing flowers to the train and laying them there before he undergoes his transformation into the Beast. If this is the case, then Kevin's split personality disorder manifested itself as a direct result of Mr. Glass's actions in the first film. He essentially created both Dunn and The Horde and I believe we will see him dealing with the repercussions of that in this film. \n\nIt also wouldn't surprise me if the little boy in Unbreakable that was being abused by the mother in the red coat was Kevin, considering that Kevin mentioned being abused growing up and that his Patricia personality wears red just like his mother did (if that was indeed him and his mother).",

Unbreakable feels like the realest superhero film to me. \n\nEdit. \nFor everyone asking, Split (with James McAvoy) is the other set up film. He's the middle jacked af man in the poster. It's also worth checking out, Bruce Willis has a brief scene in it connecting it together. \n\nEdit again. \nThere's only 2 films that set up this one (Glass), they are unbreakable and split. Both great movies. ",

The twist for that film was so epic at the time that Shyamalan\u2019s next few films were judged heavily based on how mind-blowing the last 5 minutes were, and none of them measured up to 6th sense - Unbreakable included.  In my opinion if you grade it on its own merits it still holds up.  \n",

I think the actors like it because they can flex their abilities a bit without just regurgitating dialogue.  He even got Jackson to be somewhat restrained the first time around, but his facial expressions and body language told a lot of the story(like the scene in the comic shop when the clerk was trying to kick him out)",

I remember seeing early reviews for Split praising its \u201cunguessable\u201d plot twist and thinking that anything could be guessed but boy was I wrong. Shyamalan created a twist that literally changed the genre of the film that preceded it from psychological thriller to supervillain origin movie, connected its mythos to a completely different film released years earlier, and confirmed that it was the secret second movie in a trilogy, all just by showing Bruce Willis\u2019 fucking face. That twist should be studied by college students in a decades time. The sheer complexity of it blows my mind and this movies\u2019 gonna be awesome welcome back M night!! ",

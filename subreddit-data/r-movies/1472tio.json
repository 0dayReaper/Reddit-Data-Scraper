    "postText": "I've recently re-watched this film after like maybe 15 years... It hit me pretty bad, much worse than when I was a kid - probably because I understand the message much better now and the whole social/psychological context around it. It was a much easier watch when I was a child though!  \n\n\nThe main thing that bothers me - and I'm sure I'm not alone - is that I don't understand why the Ed-Kim relationship cannot continue in some form. There are so many different ways in which I could have worked out (with obvious obstacles).  \n\n\nFirstly, I cannot for the life of me understand why she wouldn't visit him again. It makes no sense - and it was very possible, given how close they live to each other. Sure it would need to be in secret but come on, it was certainly possible for Kim to do it unnoticed, say, at night. It didn't even have to be particularly regular.\n\nSecondly, presumably at some point the people who hated Edward passed away or were to ill / old to do anything - so that would have been the perfect opportunity to get him back there again, or at least for her to start visiting again.\n\n  \nThirdly, she could have got him out of town to a doctor/someone trusted who could have helped him - he didn't need to stay there.  \n\n\nI've found the ending agonising but also illogical to a certain extent - it was meant to be 'deep love', it was so easy to go and see him, and yet she decides not to?  \n\n\nOr perhaps it was his decision too, after all he says 'goodbye' first.  \n\n\nStill, it got me really deeply depressed with no closure - which could have been achieved by one/both of them being killed off (that would have been sad too!). Rant over.",

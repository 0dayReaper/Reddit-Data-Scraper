Additions to the voice cast include: Jameela Jamil and Brad Garrett join previously announced America Ferrera and Yonas Kibreab in the intergalactic misadventure that is scheduled to take off next spring\u2014March 1, 2024.\n \n&gt;For centuries, people have called out to the universe looking for answers\u2014in Disney and Pixar\u2019s all-new movie \u201cElio,\u201d the universe calls back! The original feature film introduces Elio, an underdog with an active imagination who finds himself inadvertently beamed up to the Communiverse, an interplanetary organization with representatives from galaxies far and wide. Mistakenly identified as Earth\u2019s ambassador to the rest of the universe, and completely unprepared for that kind of pressure, Elio must form new bonds with eccentric alien lifeforms, survive a series of formidable trials and somehow discover who he is truly meant to be. \n \n&gt;Directed by Adrian Molina (screenwriter and co-director of \u201cCoco\u201d) and produced by Mary Alice Drumm (associate producer of \u201cCoco\u201d), the film features the voices of America Ferrera as Elio\u2019s mom, Olga; Jameela Jamil as Ambassador Questa; Brad Garrett as Ambassador Grigon; and Yonas Kibreab as the title character. \u201cElio\u201d releases in theaters March 1, 2024.",

Break even is likely around $500M WW. \n\nGranted, it may end up finding strong international success or have great word of mouth, but still.

I\u2019d add that all Disney film, back to the beginning, made efforts to hire artists outside the studio and the animation industry itself to do concept art. This allowed them to have a house style that they could push in different aesthetic directions. They hired Tyrus Wong to do backgrounds in Bambi, and he brought a Chinese painting knowledge with him that makes that film unique. They hired Mike Mignola to do the designs for Atlantis. They hired [Gerald Scarfe to do the concepts for Hercules](https://characterdesignreferences.com/art-of-animation-5/art-of-hercules) (most famous for Pink Floyd\u2019s the Wall). \n\nI don\u2019t feel like Pixar or current day Disney are trying so hard to find inspiration outside the usual suspects. They should be hiring unusual illustrators, looking at other art style from different cultures, and trying to make characters who don\u2019t feel like they could be swapped from one movie to another without being noticed (Frozen, Moana and Tangled characters are easily in the same universe).",

It's not the \"animation\" at all or all this talk about how Spider-Verse has changed the landscape that much. Remember Minions and Super Mario were the biggest recent animated films, Spider-Verse isn't even that close in box office. I'd argue despite the beauty and fanfare about it's innovative animation, its appeal remains fairly limited and most audiences would still prefer the classic Pixar look.",

ITSV came out in 2018 and 4.5 yrs later there hasn\u2019t been a massive impact. Despite being a hot IP it wasn\u2019t a massive hit either. Maybe ATSV will have more impact. One can argue that Spiderverse films financially r still not reaching the highs Spider-Man IP could. The random/imperfect aesthetic with varying framerates isn\u2019t for everyone. I know it\u2019s hot right now but film fans are overreacting by thinking Pixar looks bad in comparison. Not saying Spiderverse isn\u2019t great. Mario had a traditional 3D style w lots of colors and ppl loved it\n\nIn general Pixar needs better quality which comes w story/characters/themes.

Nowadays I can boil down every new Disney/Pixar plot to one sentence: \"Luca is about growing up, Turning Red is also about growing up and stepping out of your parents' shadow, Lightyear is about letting go of the past, Elemental is about accepting people that are different than you, etc.\" When your film becomes a 90-minute PSA/TED Talk that means that the message your trying to tell has taken over.",

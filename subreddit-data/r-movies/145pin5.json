Kilmer's portrayal just jizzes cool all over the screen in every scene.\n\nRegardless, if you have never dug into it the whole story of the competition between Tombstone and the Wyatt Earp film behind the scenes is an interesting piece of hollywood history.\n\nCostner was supposed to be the lead in Tombstone, he dropped out because of creative differences over wanting the movie to be more of a biopic specifically on Wyatt Earp instead of an ensemble film focused on one event in his life.\n\nHe decided to make his own movie and leveraged all of his Hollywood clout to try and sink Tombstone and prevent it from getting made so it wouldn't compete with his film.  i.e. he got all but one film distributor to refuse to work with them.  He bought up all the period costumes in Hollywood so Tombstone wouldn't have any available.\n\n&gt;\u201cIt made it really, really tough,\u201d Porro says. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t even a cowboy hat left \\[to rent\\] anywhere at any of the studios. And I freaked out.\u2026 American \\[Costume\\] wouldn\u2019t let me rent from them.\n\nThey bought the \"wealthy people\" costumes in Europe (which was likely accurate to the period) and had to make everything else.\n\nIt's poetic justice that Tombstone became the more memorable film and did moderately better at the box office than Wyatt Earp.",

Yet in these movies he's running around doing too much.\n\nAnd let's not get started on how he looks nothing like the character which, for Poirot, was another important plot point in every book.

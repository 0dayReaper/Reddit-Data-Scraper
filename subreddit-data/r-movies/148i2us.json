He actually had an MCU tattoo sleeve. Sorry for blabbing but your post reminds me that he'll never get to see the next marvel movie, and that I won't get to talk to him about it. You never know what will happen in life.",

We are quickly gathering and presenting evidence to the District Attorney with the expectation that all charges will be dropped imminently. All the evidence proves that Mr. Majors is entirely innocent and did not assault her whatsoever. Unfortunately, this incident came about because this woman was having an emotional crisis, for which she was taken to a hospital yesterday. The NYPD is required to make an arrest in these situations, and this is the only reason Mr. Majors was arrested. We expect these charges to be dropped soon.\n\n&gt;Chaudhry added that the \u201cevidence includes video footage from the vehicle where this episode took place, witness testimony from the driver and others who both saw and heard the episode, and most importantly, two written statements from the woman recanting these allegations.\u201d\n\nhttps://collider.com/jonathan-majors-defense-attorney-innocence-comments/",

It\u2019s most likely the writers affecting CA4 more so than DP and it cascaded on all their projects. But I highly doubt majors being recast has anything to do. But who knows, for all I know Majors will be in all the movies cameoing and they\u2019re trying to scrub him out and then delaying the entire marvel slate \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

They'd been trying to get this movie going for the better part of a decade and it's starting to feel more and more like they just said \"well, Harrison's getting up there, we gotta shoot something, just get a good director it'll sort itself out.\" Also it's a \"big ending\" to a franchise that has only put out one movie, a movie most people didn't like very much, since 1989, and THAT '89 film ended with them riding off into the sunset, which is, you know, already a big ending. If Mangold has managed to make anything even slightly fun and watchable, he should be rewarded, not punished\n\n(edited for clarity)",

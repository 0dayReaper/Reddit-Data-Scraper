I\u2019m so used to hating everything and everyone and having this dark outlook on the world. The use of that mindset and comedy have really helped me get through some of the worst points in my life: it\u2019s easier to not have things hurt you when you just hate everything.\n\nThen I remember Fred Rogers was a real human being. He wasn\u2019t an act. He didn\u2019t use his position to do anything malicious toward anyone. He was just this beacon of wholesome light and goodness and it makes me realize that I have spent so much time and effort hating things when I could have been like him and enjoyed things and seen the good in the world.\n\nMore than that, I could have actively been working toward making the world a better place. And then the worst part of this feeling is that he would forgive me for feeling the way I have because I was sad and scared and lonely and didn\u2019t know how to handle the circumstances I was in, but he would still see the good in me that I tried to forget about and he would call me his neighbor and invite me to help him make the world a better place.\n\nThank goodness for Fred Rogers.",

I think you described the mindset many people I know, myself included.\n\nYou know that meme that goes around, something like, \"you're not being the kind of person Mr. Rogers knew you could be\", and its supposed to be in reference to someone doing something bad or acting like an asshole or something? Yeah well that legit gets to me every time I see it. I feel like if I were in a situation like that, being obnoxious or spouting off my opinions in a rude way or something, and someone voiced that to me I would instantly stop and assess the situation. Am I doing my best to treat everyone fairly? Am I being honest? Am I making an effort to make the world a better place? Am I accepting people for who they are? When I grew out of the Mr. Rogers age and into teenage years and early 20s, the answer to those questions would most likely be no. As I got older though, and experienced all the shit life has to offer and hateful people, at some point I just decided to stop being so cynical. It just didn't help anything. I didn't have a revelation that I needed to be happy and good, I just realized that I was actually putting effort into being an ass, MORE effort than if I were to just be neutral! And it didn't do anything to solve problems and usually made them worse. So why not try to just NOT be so cynical? It improved my mental health and outlook on life dramatically. Not right away, it took time, but it definitely was a noticeable difference. \n\nEven later, I start seeing that meme, and recently watched that documentary. Now I've realized that I don't want to just be neutral anymore, that I need to inflict good upon the world if I want the world to be good. I'm at the phase now where it's not enough for me to just coast by and \"survive\". Is what I'm choosing to do going to change the world in a better way? I don't know, but I'm passionate about it and want to see if it is. Can I answer yes to all those questions I previously couldn't before? Probably not, but I'm trying my best, and I feel like that is all Mr. Rogers would have asked of me.  ",

All the colours and lights? I think that can be a lot of fun. Some go way up, and some make a big bang, and some look like flashbulbs!\n\nBut that's a firework exploding. That's not a person exploding.\n\nWhen a person explodes because they're happy, it's wonderful. But sometimes people explode because they're really mad. And they might say or do things that make other people sad. They might even accidentally hurt other people too. They might not mean to, but sometimes it happens.\n\nThat's why it's important to think about what's making us get a little crazy and explode. Is is a Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan explosion where lots of people fight a lot? Or a Tom Hanks Mister Rogers explosion where everyone is happy and really wants to feel good about something? \n\nWhich do you like? I like the second one. And I hope you come and see my movie.\n\nNow let's meet our special guest today...",

The person he's playing as is \"Mr. Rogers\", which was a well-known children's show that was on PBS (Public Broadcasting Station), which was a free access network that ran shows for children. Mr. Rogers was a very kind, wholesome person who was very well liked and did well with his role, despite the show having next to no budget.\n\nI imagine you can do a search for Mr. Rogers on Youtube and find some clips.",

At age 7, circa 1960, she and her husband took me to my first baseball game. Thanks to my Holocaust survivor parents and Mr.Rogers I didn't know that was odd. Watching Mr.Rogers was Magic.",

I know he's a great actor, but something about his face is just extremely distinctive to me, and I can't get past it.\n\nI'm sure he'll nail this role, but all I can see in this photo is Tom Hanks dressed up as an old dude.",

Looking at this photo I'm surprised how well they captured the likeness, but agree that Rogers and Hanks don't especially resemble each other.  Still, would rather Hanks be playing him than a less-fitting actor who looks more like him.",

    "postText": "Visuals: overall stunning but very cgi looking at times\n\nPlot: almost non-existent but I didn\u2019t expect too much. however, how on earth does one make a 3h movie with THIS few plot points? there would have been so much potential too. especially showing the different relationships more and with what each kid struggles etc. you literally had 2 kids who lost their parents and could have gone more into detail. that, for example, would have helped to understand Spider\u2019s actions better\n\nCharacters: not fleshed out enough. had to google a few times to find the comic book answers. and I feel like Kiri\u2019s special gifts didn\u2019t get a proper build up? or how did she learn to control them? did the Tsah\u00eck help her? overall, character development was very weak\n\n\u2018Acting\u2019: some of the facial reactions looked very strange to me. especially Jake\u2019s at certain points. and the \u2018oh yea sorry dad that my brother died\u2019 scene also didn\u2019t have the necessary impact\n\nBest scene: when the one son connects with the outcast Tulkun. Payakan was even my fav character tbh\n\nMusic: Underused",

    "postText": "I have a super distinct memory of a vin diesel look alike being blown up by a drone strike to explain why he was not the star of a sequel or something. It was from the pov of a dude in a command center with a view of the back of his bald ass head and then the guy says \u201cdo it\u201d and blows him up. I bet my friend it was in xxx: state of the union but I was wrong and lost 10 bucks. Please help put my soul to rest.\n\nEdit! I forgot to mention the bald man was sitting in a beach chair looking away from the camera when he is blown up by the drone strike.",

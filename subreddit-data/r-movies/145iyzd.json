I was just amazed. I couldn't believe I hadn't seen the plot twist. \n\nOther movies I wish I could watch again for the first time are Psycho, Memento, Ex-Machina, Black Swan, Scream...and all the Lord of the Ring and the original Star Wars trilogy.",

They used to do a classic series (about 6 movies at a time for 5 dollars I think) and they did this one. I thought it was weird at the time cause they did ones like westside story, one who flew over the coockos nest, the French connection, etc. It was the most modern of them and was awesome to see it in the theater again. Maybe they will do one next year for the 25?",

The first moment he appeared I said to my husband, \"that's weird,  why is he playing two characters?\"  My husband couldn't tell it was him until I pointed it out though.",

            "comment": "The first Matrix movie. \n\nSo when that movie first came out, I knew nothing about it except that Keanu Reeves was in it. I had only seen one ad for it in the back of a comic book, and it made no sense to me. I never even seen a commercial for it on TV. \n\nSo it's a Sunday afternoon, raining, and me and my wife haven't even been married two years by this point. We're in our first apartment, a little 1 bedroom on the second floor of this old apartment complex. We're broke, bored, and hungry. We had food, just not anything we wanted to eat. We didn't have cable TV, so we're watching \"Yan can cook\" on public television. \n\nMy wife starts talking about what she'd want to go do if we had some money. I used to teach guitar out of our apartment, and where I taught was right next to our stereo unit, which was in our entertainment center. I mention this because whenever a student paid me, I would place the money on top of the entertainment center, but for some reason, the last time I was paid, I put the money on top of the stereo, meaning that unless you were sitting low enough to see the top of the stereo, you couldn't see the money.\n\nAnyways, like I said, my wife is talking about what she'd want to do if we had some money, which was to get something to eat and go to a movie. Just then, I sort of slouched a little lower on the couch, and suddenly I could see the top of the stereo... and the $60.00 I was paid two weeks before!\n\nWell to make a long story short, we excitedly got around,  got dressed, and got some food, and drove into town to see a movie. The movie we wanted to see, and could afford because it was being shown as a Mattanee (cheaper pricing) had sold out, and there wasn't much we wanted to see. That's when I seen that they were showing the Matrix. And I said \"How about the Matrix? It's supposed to have Keanu Reeves in it, and I know you like him.?.\" \n\nMy wife thought about it and unenthusiastically said \"Sure.\"\n\nOMG! Our minds were blown, and were we so confused as to what the hell was going on, but thoroughly enjoying ourselves! And then he took the red pill!! And everything fell into place! We enjoyed the hell out of that movie, minds blown, we just talked excitedly about the movie the whole drive home. To go from having no idea about the movie, to having that whole experience was such an amazing thing to have happened to us. I had never had an experience like that before, nor after. It truly was something special.",

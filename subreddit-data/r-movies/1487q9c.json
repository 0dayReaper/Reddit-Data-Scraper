            "comment": "Ironically, despite the seemingly enormous lavishness, Cleopatra isn't even the worse case.\n\nThe worse was [*The Fall of the Roman Empire* (1964)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roLCkdvWKB4) which literally made it's producer (Samuel Bronston) bankrupt. For this movie, Bronston built a full-scale replica of the Roman Forum, which was seemingly even larger than the set built for *Cleopatra*.\n\nJust look at the entry of Commodus (one of Chrstopher Plummer's best roles) into Rome. All of those buildings are actually there and at full scale (no matte paintings were used unlike a lot of other epics including *Cleopatra*).\n\nApart from that, Sophia Loren got a $1,000,000 salary (ironically the the second actor after Liz Taylor in *Cleo*) to play Lucilla.\n\nFunnily enough, Ridley Scott would end up remaking *FOTRE* as *Gladiator* which succeeded wildly (if you compare both movies, they're almost identical in plot, characters, settings, and so on).\n\nEDIT: The backstory is that in the day, a lot of US companies had funds tied up in Francoist Spain (basically, in pestas when they actually wanted dollars). So Bronston apparently managed to convince people like Pierre Dupont (according to online sources) to invest this cash in spectacle movies - in fact, Dupont was literally his creditor. Ideally, they'd be paid back by the box office earnings, but it was obviously pretty risky if a film turned out to be a flop (like *FOTRE*).\n\nBronston's last movie was [*Circus World* (1964)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHCtwskgCYA) which is a cheesy circus-themed flick starring John Wayne (as the circus owner/manager), Claudia Cardinale (as his adopted daughter), and Rita Hayworth (she plays Wayne's former love interest). Like *FOTRE*, this movie was also a flop and he basically went out of business after that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Also, we could have gotten a even longer Cleopatra than the longest available version. Originally, the director planned for 2 parts so there would've been around *two* extra hours, including what Burton apparently called his \"best\" work in the movie.\n\nUnfortunately Fox literally junked a lot of their film outtakes in the 70s to save storage costs. So these lost scenes are gone forever outside of what we know about them from the script and still photos (unless the footage turns up in some archive)",

            "comment": "I love this movie, and I'm fascinated by what it *could* have been.\n\nThe plan wasn't for one Cleopatra movie. It was for two filmed back to back. In the first, Rex Harrison as Caesar is the male lead. In the second, Richard Burton as Antony was to be the male lead. Then Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton started a whirlwind affair that was in the tabloids every day for months. The movies were going wildly over budget. The studio was terrified they couldn't afford to do two movies when all the hype from the public was to see Taylor and Burton \u2014who might very well not be an item by the time the movie came out if they had to release the Harrison-Taylor movie first.\n\nThey chopped two epics down into one. Rex Harrison is only in the first third of the finished movie now, but by contract he has to get equal billing and promotional consideration as Burton, so in all the posters and billboards, if they wanted a picture of Burton and Taylor next to each other, they had to have Harrison hovering off to one side but at the same size and scale as Burton.\n\nThere was an actor who has three or four lines in the movie. In the original two-picture plan, he was going to be a much bigger part. He lived in Italy long enough to learn Italian and get a driver's license over there. He was very forthcoming in one of the making-of documentaries. He remembers a studio executive came out to see the set, and he spotted a walking stick that had been issued to his character. \n\n\"Let me see that!\" The executive demanded. The actor handed the prop over, and the executive looked it all over. It was made of really beautiful wood, studded with real gold and gemstones. \"This is what's wrong with this picture. This whole movie is made out of these sticks!\" The executive said with disgust.\n\nThe actor sounded very proud of that story. He spent more than a year of his life getting three or four lines into the film, but what an adventure to look back on!\n\nEdit: I went and Googled it. I'm pretty sure the actor was Hume Cronyn, who played Sosigenes, an advisor to Cleopatra.",

A lot of internet experts sure came out of the woodwork to assert with certainty that it wasn't possible for Egypt's royal lineage to dilute over the course of the 200 years of their dynasty. Gosh, I seem to remember that it was the greatest sin against mankind to represent her otherwise.\n\nBut that Elizabeth Taylor. She sure was an elegant gal. Surely, a mixed UK and Danish heritage is identical to Macedonian. Palette is everything, right? Right?",

    "postText": "I would love to see a movie or series about the Apache vs. Comanche in the 18th century. There would be so many rich topics to hit on like dispersal and use of horses, the war history of the two tribes, the Spanish Mission system and of course the super juicy stuff like slave trading, playing the Spanish, and the virtual genocide of Comanche after Apache came to power. It was a decades long war. Would be an amazing movie or series.",

Fanatic SS troops are on their way to try to kill everyone there, but the prisoners manage to get word to an American unit in the area, who link up with a *Wehrmacht* unit that is tired of fighting for the Nazis. Together, the Americans, the Germans, and the prisoners try to hold out against the Nazi attacks until help can arrive. There's also a bit about a French tennis star vaulting the wall to try to reach the Americans to get help. It's literally an unbelievable story that would make a brilliant small-scale war film.",

Some had opposed Vichy from the start, some had collaborated but for various reasons fallen foul of the fascists - having them all together in this castle fending off an SS attack seeks to me like a fantastic premise for a comedy film.",

            "comment": "The time young Julius Caesar was kidnapped by pirates. \n\n&gt;In 75 BCE a band of Cilician pirates in the Aegean Sea captured a 25-year-old Roman nobleman named Julius Caesar, who had been on his way to study oratory in Rhodes. As the story is related in Plutarch\u2019s Parallel Lives, the capture was a minor inconvenience for Caesar but very bad luck for the pirates.\n\n&gt;From the start, Caesar simply refused to behave like a captive. When the pirates told him that they had set his ransom at the sum of 20 talents, he laughed at them for not knowing who it was they had captured and suggested that 50 talents would be a more appropriate amount. He then sent his entourage out to gather the money and settled in for a period of captivity. The pirates must have been dumbfounded. It\u2019s not every day that a hostage negotiates his ransom up.\n\n&gt;Caesar made himself at home among the pirates, bossing them around and shushing them when he wanted to sleep. He made them listen to the speeches and poems that he was composing in his unanticipated downtime and berated them as illiterates if they weren\u2019t sufficiently impressed. He would participate in the pirates\u2019 games and exercises, but he always addressed them as if he were the commander and they were his subordinates. From time to time he would threaten to have them all crucified. They took it as a joke from their overconfident, slightly nutty captive.\n\n&gt;It wasn\u2019t a joke. After 38 days, the ransom was delivered and Caesar went free. Astonishingly, Caesar managed to raise a naval force in Miletus\u2014despite holding no public or military office\u2014and he set out in pursuit of the pirates. He found them still camped at the island where he had been held, and he brought them back as his captives. When the governor of Asia seemed to vacillate about punishing them, Caesar went to the prison where they were being held and had them all crucified.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/story/the-time-julius-caesar-was-captured-by-pirates",

It seems to me that you are a frustrated old man who wishes he could have been successful. When you write such poppy-cock as was in the back section of the paper you work for it shows conclusively that you're off the beam and at least four of your ulcers are at work. Some day I hope to meet you. When that happens you'll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter below! Pegler, a gutter snipe, is a gentleman alongside you.

I guess it could today only be filmed as a satire-comedy like Death of Stalin.\n\nLewis &amp; Clarke are southern Virginia Gentleman with all the good and bad that brings. Like being full of themselves, being a bit hot blooded and arrogant and Clarke having a personal black servant (read: slave).\n\nThey are serious army officers with super high opinions about themselves and the fledgling United States they represent. I pictured them sailing upriver with their polished uniforms and star spangled banner (and with guns) into more and more dangerous Indian territory, like a satire of Starship Voyager bumbling through the unknown Delta quadrant and Janeway\u2019s upholding of shiny Starfleet ideals wrecking upheaval in foreign cultures. \n\nAs their \u201cNeelix\u201d they hire a dumb French trapper, who has a young delicate Indian wife which speaks important dialects. She speaks with the Indians, the trapper translates her into French, another Franco hunter translates from French into broken English to Lewis. And vice versa back. The comedy writes itself. While the trapper is a fool his young squaw is the boss: she is pregnant and gets a child while the expedition is underway. The comedy of a soldier corps dealing with a toddler also writes itself. I think she is on the 50 Cent US coin, though I don\u2019t think she develops telepathic super powers like Kes.\n\nEvery new tribe they encounter they declare the next best guy as \u201cChief\u201d, give him a funny hat (literally!) and distribute left and right medals with the picture of the US President. I wonder how many leaders they accidentally elevated from merely respected to chieftains. Lewis makes long winded speeches which the Indians politely/baffedly endure, in which he tells they should now be at peace with their evil enemy neighboring tribes (who always stole their horses, murdered men and kidnapped women), because the great father in Washington (Jefferson) will protect them all. Lewis does make a few times a surprised-Pikachu-face when tribes later complain that their evil enemy neighbors unfairly exploited the situation and raided them to steal horses, murder men and kidnap women.\n\nSpeaking of the noble Indians who have a pure heart of virtue: almost everyone tries to rob the expedition blind and everything must be guarded or someone tries to steal it. They encounter only one tribe who doesn\u2019t demand from them alcohol. Everyone else they encounter Lewis makes a long winded political speech and implores them to travel to Washington to make official trade deals and treaties, and the Indians listen politely, and then just go \u201cYeah, big words and well said, but say, do you have more tobacco? Dude, don\u2019t be stingy, we want to smoke more!\u201d\n\nThe tall black slave, York, is a big sensation among the Indians, one time they try to rub the blackness from his skin. Or he roaringly play-chases children because they think he is a monster and he shouts he is a wild monster which was tamed by Clarke. Imagine having that in a movie today! Another time an Indian makes him fuck his wives so his \u201cmagic\u201d rubs off. In general the expedition is fucking their way through the prairie, in every tribal village the Indian women are enamored by the dashing and exotic rich strangers and the Indian men try to pimp their wives out for tobacco and alcohol. Lewis hands out to his men mercury pills against Syphilis like they are candy! I read that the heavy metal can nowadays be used to find where the expedition camped. Crazy!\n\nOne tragic comedic culture clash is when they finally encounter the mighty Sioux, proud iron age warriors ruling the prairie like the Klingons, who boastfully show off after a successful raid their newly acquired enslaved prisoners. But the Americans, being Christian and men of the enlightenment and proper Starfleet officers, feel pity seeing the poor wretched prisoners, instead of being appropriately impressed and praising the warriors prowess and battle luck, so they ask that mercy is shown and they are freed. And the baffled Sioux: \u201cWTF? No, this is not how war works, what is wrong with you?\u201d\n\nThe most sorrowful thing, in hindsight from todays perspective, is Lewis description of the natural abundance of the prairie untouched by civilization. The description of the plentitude of diverse animals. They have so much game to hunt, that they only cut the delicious tongues from shot buffaloes, and leave the rest of the meat behind.",

And one can read between the lines. Also it is not a fast paced adventure book, but a long historic biography with lots of quoted sources and the author sometimes loves to be lost long in a topic. It is a fascinating window into the past though, another review mirrors my gist:\n\n&gt; This is the ultimate adventure. A bunch of dudes, in totally uncharted territory, trying to to make it there and back alive.\n\n&gt; -it shows Indians both good and bad. Some Indians were incredibly gracious to the party. Others complete manipulative jerks. All of them wanted guns, all of them wanted tobacco, and all of them really really wanted whiskey. And they gave away their women for anyone to boink. I had too romantic a view of indians before this book... it enlightened me.\n\n&gt; -It shows how Jefferson was a man who wanted an American empire very, very badly. How he foolishly thought he could manipulate the Indians. And the utter insensitivity and disrespect white men had for indians.",

            "comment": "[When Charlie met Franz](https://www.outono.net/elentir/2023/01/12/ye-olde-pub-the-american-b-17-bomber-saved-by-a-german-bf-109-fighter-pilot/)\n\nDecember 20, 1943. After bombing the hell out of Bremen, Germany, an American B-17 piloted by Charles Brown suffered damage to three out of four engines, half the crew were wounded or dead, with damaged electronics, hydraulics, and flight control systems, and no radio. The crew discussed bailing out, but that would mean leaving a severely wounded crew member behind, so they elected to try and make it out of German airspace.\n\nAs they flew low and slow back to friendly lines, they were intercepted by German Ace Franz Stigler.\n\n&gt;[Brown's damaged, straggling bomber was spotted by Germans on the ground, including Franz Stigler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Brown_and_Franz_Stigler_incident) (then an ace with 27 victories), who was refueling and rearming at an airfield. He soon took off in his Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-6 (which had a .50-cal. M2 Browning machine gun bullet embedded in its radiator, risking the engine overheating) and quickly caught up with Brown's plane. Through openings torn in the damaged bomber's airframe by flak and machine gun fire, Stigler was able to see the injured and incapacitated crew. To the American pilot's surprise, the German did not open fire on the crippled bomber. Stigler instead recalled the words of one of his commanding officers from JG 27, Gustav R\u00f6del, during his time fighting in North Africa: \"If I ever see or hear of you shooting at a man in a parachute, I will shoot you myself.\" Stigler later commented, \"To me, it was just like they were in a parachute. I saw them and I couldn't shoot them down.\"\n\nInstead of shooting down the helpless bomber, Stigler put his own life and career in jeopardy by flying alongside his crippled enemy to escort them back home.\n\n&gt;Using signs, the German pilot tried to convince Brown to deviate and fly to Sweden, which would be their shortest route to find salvation and free themselves from captivity, but the American pilot did not understand him. The commander of the B-17 wanted to return to England, and since he ignored his instructions, Stigler decided to risk his life again by flying in formation with the B-17 so that German anti-aircraft artillery would not mow down Brown and his men. Stigler also risked being identified and shot for treason by returning to his base.\n\nForty years later, Stigler and the pilot of the American bomber, Charles Brown, would reunite.\n\n&gt;After the war, Stigler moved to Canada. In 1986, the then Lieutenant Colonel Brown was invited to a meeting of World War II veteran pilots held at the Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama (United States). There he finally told the story that occurred on December 20, 1943. As a result, Brown began to look for records that would allow him to identify that German pilot. Four years later he received a letter from Stigler identifying himself as the pilot of the Bf-109 that had escorted him. When they spoke by phone, the German pilot gave details of what had happened that only Brown knew, proving that the testimony of him was true.\n\nThe two became best friends until their deaths in 2008.\n\nWar is hell and human beings can be monsters. But people can also be noble, compassionate, and forgiving when they choose to be. I think this could make one hell of a movie.",

One guy, Albert Mussey Johnson, actually came to see the vast mining operation.  \n\nScotty put him and his wife on mules and circled around the one small operation he had, each time claiming it was a different mine.  Johnson wasn't happy about the scam, but liked Scotty anyway.  The dry heat was good for his wife's ailments, so they decided to build a big beautiful home there. \n\nWord got out that there was a castle in the middle of America's hottest, most barren desert - literally in the middle of nowhere - owned by a tall-tale-telling guy named Scotty.  So a San Francisco reporter went to interview the owner.  Johnson answered the door, got him a drink, and had him wait while he got the person the reporter requested, Death Valley Scotty.  He then listened in while Scotty took the reporter on a tour of \"his\" house, explaining endlessly how hard he'd worked in his mine until he hit it big.  And how he'd designed it all himself.  \n\nSadly, [Scotty's Castle is closed due to flood](https://dvnha.org/program-events/scottys-castle-flood-recovery-walking-tours/) damage.   It was my favorite place to take California visitors - just not during summer.",

When I imagine the dreadful end of our retreat, involuntarily I sigh and become pensive.

            "comment": "The General Slocum fire (June 15, 1904): A paddle steamer packed with picnickers from a Manhattan church bursts into flames while cruising up the East River. Over a thousand died due to the decrepitness of the boat, which included layers upon layers of flammable paint and varnish, rotten life jackets, and lifeboats that were wired in place and unmovable. In addition the captain of the Slocum exacerbated the tragedy by speeding to a nearby island in an effort to beach her, fanning the flames as he did so. Though it was NYC\u2019s greatest tragedy until 9/11, the General Slocum has been largely forgotten today.\n\nThe attack of the 1st Minnesota (July 2, 1863): On the second day of the battle of Gettysburg, the 1st Minnesota Infantry Regiment, down to 262 officers and men, was ordered to fix bayonets and charge against two brigades of Confederate infantry\u2014numbering over 1,200\u2014advancing toward a gap that had opened up in the Union Line. In just five minutes of brutal combat, 215 Minnesotans fell dead or wounded; a casualty rate of 82%. Only 47 got back to the Union lines but their attack bought time for reserve troops to be brought up. \n\nIncredibly, the 1st Minnesota was back in action the next day, helping to repulse Pickett\u2019s Charge and managed to capture a CSA battle flag, which is now kept by the Minnesota Historical Society. Numerous requests have been made by Virginians for the flag\u2019s return. They\u2019ve all been refused.",

            "comment": "I have several ideas:\n\n1. The Battle of the Imjin River (1951) during the Korean War, sometimes called the \"Thermopylae\" of that war, saw heavily, heavily outnumbered British, Belgian, and Luxembourger troops hold off a major Chinese offensive long enough for the rest of the United Nations/South Korean forces to organize a successful defense of the South Korean capital of Seoul. Casualties were heavy, and one British battalion, the Glosters, basically ceased to exist for a while (it was the bloodiest battle in post-World War II British history), but it helped save the day for the UN/South Korean side.\n2. While there has a been a movie or two about this battle (including the silent *Verdun: Looking at History* \\[1928\\]), I'd love to see a major epic about the Battle of Verdun (1916) during World War I. The battle lasted almost the entire year of 1916, and saw Germany launching a major offensive to seize the fortified French city of Verdun...or bleed France white in the process. It's sometimes considered one of the most intense military engagement in history for per-square-meter horror, with up to 500,000 French casualties and up to 400,000 German casualties (some estimates for both are lower). In the end, Germany failed to capture Verdun and French morale was pretty much intact (though shaky).\n3. How about a movie about the Czechoslovak Legion's role in the Russian Civil War? After World War I basically concluded on the Eastern Front, the Allied Czechoslovakian troops there took to the railways of Russia to get to the Western Front to continue fighting for their independence. Czechoslovakia essentially became a nation on rails as the Legion battled its way across the Trans-Siberian Railway in armored trains. With the help of Allied soldiers in Vladivostok, they were safely evacuated from Russia and founded the new country of Czechoslovakia, which was a democracy and would remain so until invaded by Nazi Germany on the eve of World War II.\n4. The Baltic Wars of Independence (1918-1920) following World War I are ripe for a historical epic. With the collapse of the Russian and German Empires, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania became independent countries, so soon three-way wars broke out for control of them. The people of the Baltic states (aided by Nordic volunteers and the British navy) were on one side, newly-communist Russia on another, and German militias backed by the Baltic Germans were the third. Eventually the Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians drove out the Russians and German militias and secured their independence. The three countries would start out with democratic governments, although all three would succumb to dictatorships by the time World War II broke out.",

            "comment": "An actual historical drama based on the life of Yasuke, the African man who became a samurai serving Nobunaga. \n\nThere is an animated Netflix drama, but it is basically a fantasy. \n\nHis actual story is beyond weird - enslaved in Africa, taken to be a child soldier in India, ended up serving the Portuguese (as the result of a siege - he was a mercenary soldier for the side that lost, he was trapped in a town under siege, the only way out was a Portuguese galleon - so he volunteered as a rower). Worked his way up to personal bodyguard to the Jesuit father-visitor, taken to Japan \u2026 where his very appearance causes a sensation ..  and a riot. \n\nAs it turns out, the Jesuits and Yasuke show up at the capital city during a major festival. The streets are crowded with drunken revellers. Nearly all had never seen a Black man before, particularly not one well over six feet tall (Yasuke was famously tall and strong). So he attracted rock-star treatment: hundreds, then thousands of people trying to get at him, because he was such a novelty \u2026 they grew increasingly violent, started to rip souvenirs out of his clothes - he had to literally run for his life from would-be admirers. This leads to a chase and a riot. \n\nNobunaga, bloodthirsty would-be unifier of Japan, hears the riot (his palace was close by) and sends his men to break heads and find out what caused the disturbance. This was not a man who took such disturbances lightly - he was in the habit of killing anyone who even mildly inconvenienced him. His men return with Yasuke in tow. Now, the poor fellow is face to face with the would-be ruler of Japan.\n\nAs it turned out, Nobunaga was in an affable mood. He was fascinated by the sight of Yasuke - as well as impressed with his strength, military skills, and that he already knew some Japanese (his life had forced him to be a quick linguist). \n\nHowever, Nobunaga was suspicious that Yasuke was a fake. There was reason for this. \n\nNobunaga had suppressed a \u201crebellious\u201d Buddhist sect (in a great massacre), much to the delight of the Jesuits. One of the Buddhist protective deities was a figure with black skin. Could Yasuke be a Jesuit trick of some sort, a kind of reference to the Buddhist deity? An ordinary man just painted black? \n\nNobunaga had to know. \n\nSo he ordered Yasuke to strip, took a scrubbing brush and bucket of water, and personally gave Yasuke a good scrubbing. \n\nNeedless to say, it was no trick, and Nobunaga was duly impressed. He hinted to the Jesuits that he, Nobunaga, would like to keep Yasuke. While Yasuke wasn\u2019t a slave, needless to say, what Nobunaga wants, he gets - and Nobunaga was so happy with this new retainer he made him a samurai, and one of his personal bodyguards.",

Russians built up another fleet of warships and had them sail from the Baltic Sea to the waters around Japan because their previous fleet was destroyed by the Japanese military in China. During this voyage, the Russians accidentally fired on civilian boats from multiple European countries, including Britain, and almost started a war between the Brits. Then, after stopping in Africa, they brought multiple animals into their ships, the result being that they became floating zoos afterwards. They even fired on their own ships on a couple of occasions. After all of this, the Russians finally made it to the seas around Japan and they immediately got obliterated by the Japanese fleet shortly thereafter.",

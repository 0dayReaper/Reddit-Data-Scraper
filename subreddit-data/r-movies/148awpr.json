    "postText": "Yes, I know pacifism nowadays is seen as a quite naive thing, but when I think about notorious anti-war films like Apocalypse Now or Johnny Got his Gun, I really feel how good the art of cinema can be in showing the horrible consequences of wars and how it can stimulate pacifism.\n\nOf course, this \"pro-pacifism\" effect is clearly overpowered by many (American) movies that depict wars and military as \"pretty shinny cool things\". Even some of them are like \"Uncle Sam I want you\" well done pro-military commercials. I myself as a kid went out of the cinema with the firm purpose of becoming a fighterpilot after watching TopGun...\n\nBut in my case everything changed a few years later when I watched \"Born in The 4th of July\"... It was the right time, right place and, paradoxically, a movie with the same actor, took me totally almost from one side to the other...\n\nDid you have any similar experience with a movie that blew your mind and made you more conscious and pacifist? What is your favorite pacifist movie?",

A renowned actor best known for his role as a soldier, Ayres had developed strong pacifist views and stood by those principles despite fierce public and professional backlash.\n\nAyres was considered \u201ca household symbol across the nation, embodying everything that was good and decent and upstanding \u2013 and American.\u201d What people didn\u2019t know, however, was that he was a philosophical thinker, studying everything from Buddhism to Christianity. He was a vegetarian and believed that \u201cwar was the greatest sin.\u201d",

A legendary gunslinger believed to be the most dangerous man alive turns out to be a pacifist haunted by a tragic past who believes that no one has the right to take a life, and there is always a way to save everyone.\n\nTakes a bit to get going, (it's a little silly in the first season) but season two takes a more serious turn and hits on a lot of deep themes about morality and pacfism that have majorly impacted the way I live my life.",

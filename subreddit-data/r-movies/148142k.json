    "postText": "As per the title, I'm planning some travel next year and I would really like to attend the Cannes Film Festival. I'm Australian and can budget around $15,000 AUD (roughly $10k USD) for the trip. Are parts of the festival open to the public assuming they've paid for admission of some sort or is it exclusively press/industry people? The Cannes website is a little vague although that could be because the 2023 festival just finished. Any info is welcome.",

You can only register for the pass a few months before next year\u2019s festival starts, probably in February or March.",

In addition to the 3 Days an Cannes program mentioned by another user, the festival *does* host a few public facing screenings, but they are all first come, first serve, and *not* cheap.",

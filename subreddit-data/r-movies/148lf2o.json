    "postText": "**The Big Lebowski** and **No Country For Old Men** and the Coen brothers two most famous movies (or at least the ones I hear referenced the most) .  The plots and manner of speaking have nothing in common.  Unlike other A-list directors (Nolan, Scorsese, Tarantino, PTA) it's hard for me to see any stylistic similarities between the 2 films. I'm sure there is, I just haven't noticed it; even after multiple viewings of both movies.",

            "comment": "Like most films in the Coen\u2019s body of work, both The Big Lebowski and No Country offer a very nihilistic world view that binds them thematically.\n\nIn both films, the driving motivation for each character is to gain possession of a briefcase of money. However, as the plots unfold, the consequences begin piling up, and ultimately no one wins, rendering all the suffering caused by those consequences meaningless.\n\nBoth movies posit that the universe is chaotic and things happen for no reason. This philosophy is very prominent in the film noir sub-genre, which both TBL and No Country draw from extensively. The former is essentially a reimagining of the plot from The Big Sleep with a stoner, deadbeat in place of the hard-boiled detective. And the latter relocates the power struggle between agents of differing morality that would normally be found in a big city to the rural west.\n\nWhere the films differ is in their ultimate outlook of the remaining characters in the wake of the chaotic events. In TBL, The Dude and Walter still manage to find happiness in the little things, despite now seeing how uncaring and meaningless the universe is, perfectly summed up by the refrain, \u201cFuck it, let\u2019s go bowling.\u201d This is vastly different from the ending of No Country which sees Tom Bell withdraw from his old life by handing in his badge when he realizes he no longer understands the meaningless violence of the world.",

One of my all time favorites.\n\nYou're right, there certainly isn't a lot of similarities. But I think there are some. There's spattering's of dark/dry humor throughout No Country For Old Men similar to The Big Lebowski. For example:\n\nThe shopkeeper's response when Llewelyn asks him if they get a lot of people coming into his shop not wearing any clothes: \"No, sir. It's unusual.\"\n\n* Beforehand, when Llewelyn walks in wearing nothing but a hospital robe and the boots he bought, the clerk's first response is \"How're them Larry's holding up?\"\n\nHere's a pretty good list of a bunch of others.\n\n[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Funny/NoCountryForOldMen](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Funny/NoCountryForOldMen)",

            "comment": "The lighting is less natural in The Big Lebowski, but Roger Deakins uses very even tones and minimal camera movements in both movies. Both are essentially crime stories, of course, centered around a guy who's forced to evaluate his life at a late age. Bridges and Tommy Lee are both propelled through this twisty turny misadventure because of a case of stolen money, but neither pursue any particular goals of their own. Fate and happenstance play a big role in their stories, and of course there's always a narrator talking over a Western landscape.",

All you have to do is google The Big Lebowski and you'll notice the endless amount of Lebowski paraphernalia you can find to buy. You won't see anything that comes close it with the other two movies.",

If you want to get into numbers, though, none have earned as much as True Grit, so there is that.  Definitely Lebowski is more quotable and relatable to some demographics, but Fargo is more commonly known among all demographics, hence my reasoning.\n\nBut, alas, this is a dead horse upon which we beat.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2vdemb/fargo_the_big_lebowski_or_no_country_for_old_men/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button",

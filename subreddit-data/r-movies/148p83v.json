    "postText": "So this will, of course, contain some spoilers for the movie... So if you haven't seen it yet, go ahead! It's great!\n\nBut anyway, at 58 minutes into the film, after the horse gets shredded in the boat's rotors and everything, right as the scenes switch to the mental health facility, the titular ring flashes on screen as a sort of transition... For a SINGLE frame. It took me three rewatches to catch that. My family members who'd seen the movie a few times as well we're also surprised by this. And after rigorous searching online, I've not seen anybody else discussing this. I'm sure I'm not the first, but HAS anybody else seen this?",

The bit where you character is reading out his movie plot ideas while his henchman is spitting in the background feels like an homage to *Boogie Nights*. What was it like shooting this scene?

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead\u2013 murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time \u2013 something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange \u2013 uh, I guess... I guess you call it a \"hit\" \u2013 on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in \"Blood Money.\"] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.",

For whatever it\u2019s worth, I think my favorite scene in the films is Peter telling Aunt May the truth about surrounding Uncle Ben\u2019s death - it makes me tear up every time and I\u2019ve always found it to be a powerful sequence, thanks to you and Rosemary Harris. \n\nNow the question: 20 years after the original Raimi Spider-Man debuted, what are your thoughts on the lasting appeal of the trilogy and how the films still resonate with people today?\n\nSide note, if you haven\u2019t checked it out before, I recommend browsing r/raimimemes! It\u2019s safe to say that over there you\u2019ve become something of an icon.",

Did you feel the significance of putting that suit back on when you saw the theater reactions (not to mention Box Office as well), and are you content with closing that chapter of your life?",

                            "comment": "It really feels like most of the folks here have either not read Molly's Game or they've only read that, so as someone who read that, read other books/accounts of the games, and have dug through a few internet archived interviews, here is my best attempt at an objective summary of what happened (I've [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deuxmoi/comments/wymobj/comment/ilxz97b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) this on other subs before, so a few of you may or may not have seen it):\n\nMolly Bloom wrote a memoir talking about her time running legal and illegal high stakes poker games in the 00s in LA and NYC (her book also talks about her competitive skiing career, drug addiction, involvement with the Russian mob, and strained relationship with her dad among other things). Tobey Maguire is widely considered one of the best celebrity poker plays out there, and Molly writes about him attending her games, and her portrayal of him is really, really negative. I'm going based off recall, but she called him \"the best player, the worst tipper, and the absolutely worst loser\" said he was incredibly greedy, paranoid\\*, enjoyed watching other people lose especially if they couldn't afford it, stakes other players in the game so hed profit off of their wins but wouldnt have to pay for their losses (back to that later) and the most infamous moment from the book she claims he told her he'd tip her a 1k chip if she barked like a seal. She more or less blames him for why she left LA to start a new ring in NYC .Previously, the California games were considered legal because all of the money Bloom made came from tips, so she didn't need a gaming license (just like how your parents could play cards against their friends in the kitchen without needing a license) but once she got to New York, she kept losing money because players kept skipping out when it came time to pay their losses. She was going into debt from this, so to make it up she started taking a percentage of the pot (which would require a gaming license and thus made her NY games illegal) skipping ahead a while, one of the players from the LA games Bradley Ruderman was a billionaire hedge fund manager who got caught running a ponzi scheme. When the feds tried to recuperate the money Ruderman stole, they ended up following it back to Molly's LA games and tried to get the money from the players Ruderman lost to (he was a VERY bad player. Molly alleges she tried to teach him how to play because he was so bad. more on that in a bit) most of the players settle and give back some of the money (Tobey reportedly handed over around 80k) and Molly ended up going to trial because light was shed on her legally-questionable games. She ended up getting off of most of it, published her memoir, and lives in Colorado. She mentioned wanting to finish law school and going after the legal system for unfair practices but I haven't been able to find much on that these days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*exhale \\*\n\n\\*inhale again \\*\n\nSo the movie adaptation of Bloom's book comes out in 2017, and in 2020 one of the players from Molly's Game named Houston Curtis publishes his own memoir detailing the Los Angeles games from his perspective (when I said above Bloom talks about how Tobey staked another player at one point so he'd earn a portion of his winnings but not have to pay for his losses, this is that guy. In the movie his name was changed to Harlan Eustice) his account of the events differs from Blooms in a handful of notable ways. For one, Bloom claims she was instrumental to starting the first games in the Viper Room and was the one solely running them the whole time they were in LA. Houston details how the games originally started at Tobey's house (side note: some of my favorite details in the book are Houston describing how much of a Type-A neat freak Tobey is. I won't go into the crocs/pepperoni story now, but ask and I will gladly respond). Houston says that they invited mostly amateur rich guys and whales (term for extremely wealthy billionaire-type players who were terrible at poker) to play with them and their friends (like Leo and Ben Affleck liked to play with them which in turn attracted more people to come to the games) and counter to Bloom's book, Tobey only wanted to play against insainly rich guys who could afford to lose and would disinvite players if he sensed that they were getting too emotional over a loss (Houston gives names as examples of folks they cut, but i dont have the book on me) Eventually, they decided to switch to the Viper Room (which is when Bloom got involved) because Tobey got tired of having guys he didn't like making a mess and bringing meat &amp; alcohol into his house (again, please ask). So initially the games are going well and everyone was getting along, but eventually friction starts up between Molly and Tobey and Houston finds himself in the middle. Bloom accuses Tobey of being paranoid in her memoir, but Houston gives some details that, if true, do paint Molly in a less-than-trustworthy light. For one, she started taking a percentage of the dealer's/waitresses' tips, and this is despite the fact that she was making upwards of $30,000 a night. Additionally, Houston gives multiple instances when Molly invited professional online poker players to the games under the guise that they were amateurs so they could split their winnings with her (and Houston names names of these people). Also Houston alleges that Molly was heavily doing drugs during the LA games and Tobey having been a teenage alcoholic/member of AA did NOT like people doing drugs around him especially people in charge of his money being on drugs. So Tobey over the years really starts to dislike Molly, in his eyes thinks she's overpaid for doing a bad job (although Houston claims he always tipped well) and wants to replace her, but Houston really liked Molly and wanted to keep her around. Eventually things came to a head and Tobey ended things with Molly but did offer her name to a guy running a poker ring in New York sort of as a peace offering/get-out-of-my-hands gesture that it seems like she declined (Houston was a bit vague on this). Anywho, the last chunk of the book focuses more on Houston's life after the financial crash leaves him very badly off, his relationship with Tobey sours, the Ruderman lawsuit leaves him broke (he tried to fight it while everyone else settled) his family splits, he moves back to the Midwest, Molly offers him to be a consultant on the movie adaptation but he doesn't get involved. These days he doesn't keep in touch with either of Molly or Tobey but he seems neither resentful towards either. He just kind of more disappointed in himself for choices he made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*exhales a 2nd time \\* holy shit I did not mean to write this detailed of a summary. I am so fucking sorry if you're still reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs someone who read both books, I think Bloom's book is the better written of the two (narrative, flow, language) but I ultimately think I am more inclined to believe Houston's account of the events (not that I trust either 100%, but it made it so I dont see either as the definitive truth) For one, Bloom only names people in her book that were named in the lawsuit against Ruderman, everyone else gets an alias. Houston names everyone from the billionaire trust fund players they played against to the dealers who worked with Bloom. Next, Houston was very in the middle with his relationships to Molly and Tobey, and I think that showed in his portrayal of them both in his book. He goes into depth depicting their flaws and isn't afraid to portray them in a very unflattering light. Tobey is a Type-A grouch who gets too caught up in the thrill of the games and is not afraid to let people know when he dislikes them, which definitely became the case with Bloom towards the end of their years working together. Molly, to Houston, is just as greedy as Tobey, is dishonest about her account of the events, and is hypocritical about her moral superiority complex. As a reader, it felt like he portrayed the two as flip sides to the same coin. That being said, Houston also gives them both credit and recognizes their redeeming qualities. Tobey's shown to like winning but has moral limits to this. Probably the most notable story Houston gives was when a trust fund billionaire loses $1million to Tobey in a drunken game and weeks later when the guys supposed to pay him, Tobey rejects the winnings and brings him along to an AA meeting, and the rich guy ends up telling Houston about this years after the fact. And for all the times Houston depicts Molly as dishonest and greedy herself, he continuously refers to her as like a sister and remarks about her good nature, intelligence, and backs up times when he feels she was in the right over a situation and Tobey was wrong. As I said, it's not as scandalous in the sense that there are no pure villains in Houston's story (although God he name drops some absolute douche bag nepotism babies who may come close) but if you're into other perspectives, I recommend giving it a try (it's also a quick read. I finished it in one sitting)",

                                            "comment": "So in the BDHH, Houston is describing how the LA games got their start in Tobey's kitchen of all places. He kept the poker table in the kitchen's breakfast nook because it was a convenient place, much to Houston's chagrin who kept insisting they move to at least the living room where there'd be slightly more ambiance. More on that in a bit. In the book Houston says something to the effect of \"keeping the table in the kitchen wasn't the oddest thing about those early games. Tobey's got a lot of what you might call... eccentricities\" (to which I remember closing the book and whispered aloud \"fuck yes.\" There is nothing I love more in life than when rich and famous people are also fucking weird)  \n\n\n  \nStarting off, Tobey's been vegetarian/vegan since he was practically a kid, and Houston cites that one of the reasons why they decided to pick up shop and relocate to the Viper Room was because Tobey hated having \"these scumbag poker players\" (a direct quote) bringing meat and alcohol into his house every week. Houston said that Tobey wouldn't outwardly complain to the other guys if they ordered pepperoni pizza or something, but he would sit there looking really sad because there were dead animals in his house and no one would eat the vegan spinach-quinoa shit he/his private chef made for them. I'm vegetarian myself, but something about Tobey Maguire sulking over a box of pepperoni pizza while sadly nibbling on spinach puffs is just really amusing to me.  \n\n\n  \nBetter than that, Houston explains that Tobey's a germaphobe and super insistent on keeping his house clean (which checks out with other articles/interviews I read. One from around 03-04 mentioning how growing up in poverty was really destabilizing for him constantly moving from shelters, relatives homes, etc. so keeping a clean space was like gaining a sense of control. Idk, you didn't come here for the armchair psychoanalysis) So when people would come in, they'd have to take off their shoes (which I mean my family does, not so weird) and slip on a pair of Crocs. I couldn't tell from Houston's description if that meant everyone was wearing Crocs all the time at Tobey's house or if it was just the people who were insistent on wearing shoes inside, but I get a kick out of the image of a bunch of Hollywood producers, billionaire nepotism guys, and A-List actors playing high stakes poker for 10s and 100s of thousands of dollars in Tobey's breakfast nook wearing Crocs.  \n\n\n  \nSo Houston explains that the final tipping point for Tobey moving the poker table from the kitchen to the living room (and shortly after, relocating all together to the Viper Room) was when Jeffrey Katzenburg, the creator of The Lion King and Shrek, lost $40,000 to Houston alone in one night and got so tired of sitting in Tobey's cramped kitchen nook, watching his chef make gross vegan food, and getting his ass kicked while wearing goddamn Crocs that he never returned to their games again.  \n\n\n  \nSo if there is any lesson to be learned from any of this, kids, if you plan on conniving millions of dollars out of amateur billionaire poker players in technically-legal under ground games, make sure your guests feel welcomed. Otherwise, you will lose participants and be disinvited to Shrek 2.",

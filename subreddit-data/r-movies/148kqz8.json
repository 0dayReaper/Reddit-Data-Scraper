    "postText": "In 2008, the movie Eagle Eye seemed to predict everything that is going on in the world right now with surveillance technology. It may have just been a movie but it definitely seems to be very similar to real life now. In the last fifteen minutes of the movie Burn After Reading, George Clooney's character talks about how cell phones are going to be used to track people in the future. Both movies ironically came out in 2008.",

Plus, if we're looking for the *earliest* predictions:\n\nThere was a 1947 French film \"[*T\u00e9l\u00e9vision \u0153il de demain*](https://kottke.org/20/06/1947-film-smartphone-prediction)\" that predicted smart phones and the appearance and hazards of staring at handheld screens.\n\nAnd I would argue that *War Games* (1983) predicted online gaming before *Cable Guy* (1996). And interestingly, both starred Matthew Broderick. \n\n*Metropolis* (1927) is probably the first movie to feature video conferencing. \n\nAs far as genetic engineering, one might be tempted to count really old items like *Frankenstein* (1910), *The Island of Lost Souls* (1932) or *The Boys from Brazil* (1978), but these are really more about vivisection, mutation or breeding. The earliest example of definite genetic engineering I can find is *Blade Runner* (1982). \n\nAnd the earliest movie example of a scientist creating a robot girlfriend (or in this case, robot dead wife), goes back to Metropolis (1927) again.\n\nAs far as *personally* targeted advertising, I'm not sure I have a earlier choice than *Minority Report* (2002), but some interesting near-misses might go back as far as *The Hucksters* (1947), or *The Bells of St. Mary's* (1945), which featured targeting specific audience segments and simple interactive advertising, respectively.\n\nEdit: typo and date",

We have something in Germany called \"Pr\u00e4ventivhaft\" (preventive custody) that allows the police to arrest and keep you in custody for a limited amount of time to prevent crimes or other actions that might disrupt the public order. In most states this is limited to a few days, but some states like Bavaria allow times in custody up to 2 months. Lately this has been making the news because it has been used to detain climate activists to prevent their protests.",

    "postText": "Hi all guys, hoping this is the right reddit I wanted to ask for advice regarding movies in the Spaghetti Western genre, actually I'm interested in any kind of movies about the West but if I understand correctly it's just the category to be called that, by the way I'm also Italian so it's perfect.\n\nI've always been a fan of it, I madly loved the Dollars Trilogy and Red Dead Redemption 2, so I decided to take the plunge and I'd like to go through Western cinema in a conscientious way, not just seeing the best films of the genre but trying to do it in chronological order and making a culture about it.\n\nI am not a film expert however I do know a little bit about it, I don't want to see every single film on Western of course, but it would be nice if you could recommend the big names that have made the history of the genre with the films related to them, so that I can retrace the cinematic West step by step.\n\nIn this post I am referring to the movies, but also knowing about the series of the era, just to have even more background, would be nice (although I don't think I will watch them), Fury 1955 comes to mind to give an example.\n\nI realize it's no small job to recommend such things so of course I'll leave the post for possible other folks who might want to get into the genre in the future, thank you all for your attention and thanks for the help!",

            "comment": "Spaghetti westerns are pretty much my favorite sub genre!  I apologize in advance for the massive wall of text incoming but I just love talking about this genre and I have some stuff you may be interested in!\n\nThe general consensus that I\u2019ve seen (which I agree with) is that after Leone the best director of spaghettis was Sergio Corbucci.  I\u2019m actually not the biggest fan of Django compared to some of his other movies but it\u2019s definitely essential viewing for the genre, as are most of his other movies.  My favorites of his are the Great Silence, the Mercenary, Companeros, Navajo Joe, and the Hellbenders.  His second spaghetti Minnesota Clay is also very interesting, it was released right as the spaghetti craze was beginning to take off so it retains more of an American western feel than many later spaghettis.   Corbucci is also  notable for having noticeably stronger female characters than many of his contemporaries.\n\nThere was a lot of political or social commentary in the spaghettis of the late 60s and early 70s.  The three films of Sergio Sollima (the Big Gundown, Face to Face, and Run Man Run) are notable examples; the first two are some of the absolute best the genre has to offer while RMR is weaker but still very enjoyable.  Other examples of politically themed spaghettis include a Bullet for the General, directed by Damiano Damiani and Duck, You Sucker, directed by Leone, as well as the aforementioned Companeros and the Mercenary, directed by Corbucci.  \n\nGiuliano Gemma was one of the most important leading men when it comes to spaghettis.  He brought a combination of good looks (his nickname was angel face) and incredible athleticism to his roles.  If you watch a Gemma film you\u2019ll always see some impressive acrobatics from him; he was also extremely proficient with pistols and occasionally taught other spaghetti actors how to handle them properly.\n\nThe Sartana movies (four with Gianni Garko in the title role, one with George Hilton) were extremely popular and influential for their mixture of typical spaghetti violence, black humor, Bond like gadgets and ridiculously serpentine plot lines.  Garko was one of the best leading men in the genre and these are probably his most essential work.  \n\nThe first Trinity film with Terence Hill and Bud Spencer ushered in a new era of comedic spaghettis, with heavy use of slapstick humor and much less bloodshed.  The early 70s were largely dominated by these.  While many were very successful commercially, there were and still are a lot of fans who don\u2019t care for them or the comedic direction they took the genre in. \n\nI\u2019ll wrap this up by talking briefly about the \u201ctwilight\u201d era spaghettis made in the mid to late 70s when the genre was almost dead.  These often had a melancholic, decaying atmosphere and tended to be darker, less action packed and  more character driven.  My personal favorite of these is Keoma, starring the legendary Franco Nero.  Some other notable ones from this era include Four of the Apocalypse, Mannaja, California, and Silver Saddle.  \n\nI\u2019m by no means an expert but I hope you found some of this interesting! The spaghetti western database online has a ton of amazing reviews and information as well for further reading",

            "comment": "John Ford was one of the chief directors of westerns and naturally had an influence on Leone, as well as Kurosawa whose *Yojimbo* was the basis for the earliest spaghetti westerns. Leone liked *The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance* the best of Ford's films, but that's a late work so you probably shouldn't start with it. (you also mentioned RDR2, and Arthur Morgan is definitely a Fordian protagonist.)\n\nOther grittier American westerns can feel similar to Italian ones, especially the work of Robert Aldrich (*Vera Cruz*) and Anthony Mann (*Man of the West*).",

            "comment": "Web search on Wikipedia: Spaghetti Western.\nThere are numerous sources to choose from by a search of 'spaghetti westerns.'\n\nSome excerpts:\nThe term \u201cspaghetti western\u201d was coined by Spanish journalist Alfonso S\u00e1nchez to describe the low-budget films being made in Italy during the 1960s and early 1970s. Italian directors, writers, and producers filmed spaghetti westerns throughout Europe, shooting in countries like Italy and Spain.\nAccording to veteran Spaghetti Western actor Aldo Sambrell, the phrase \"Spaghetti Western\" was coined by Spanish journalist Alfonso S\u00e1nchez in reference to the Italian food spaghetti. Spaghetti Westerns are also known as Italian Westerns or, primarily in Japan, Macaroni Westerns. In Italy, the genre is typically referred to as western all'italiana (Italian-style Western). Italo-Western is also used, especially in Germany.\nThe Spaghetti Western is a broad subgenre of Western films produced in Europe. It emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's film-making style and international box-office success. The term was used by foreign critics because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians.\n\n\nNow you can easily read about 'western films' that were made in Europe back as far as 1910.",

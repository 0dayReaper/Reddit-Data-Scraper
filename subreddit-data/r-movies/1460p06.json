    "postText": "Last and First Men is a slow, fictional documentary, giving an ethereal poetic message told from two billion years in the future. Under the backdrop of Yugoslav Neo-Neolithic, futuristic landscapes, I arrive at a strange sense of familiarity and connectedness, yet loneliness and separation. The imagery, prose, and score is awesome in the most literal sense.\n\n\nOut of all I have seen, this has made me realise the fragility, the beauty, the horror, and the wondrous cyclical nature of the human existence. \n\nMostly what remains, throughout the tales that the narrator tells is this.. \n\n..\n\nThe quiet between phrases of history. The long pauses. Lost and forgotten stories and chapters of our history, and the messages we try to send to our descendants through grand architecture, tales of legend, and music.\n\n\n\u201cWhen these individuals join in simultaneous mental unity, the entire past of the species appears a personal memory..\u201d",

What\u2019s more important that what is said, is the deeper canvas it is painted on. The human aspects. If you treat it as a factual documentary, and suspend your disbelief for a moment, you will have a very eye opening experience about our own real history, and the connections we have to our ancestors.",

You\u2019re suggesting it to people but it\u2019s not very clear in your description that it\u2019s an extremely difficult film for 95% of people to watch. It\u2019s as unconventional as it gets. It\u2019s pretty and it\u2019s thought provoking, and it\u2019s good art, but it\u2019s a lot like Skinamarink in the sense that it\u2019s *highly* unconventional even though it gets filed alongside more mainstream films\n\nEdited to add: You\u2019re coming off as rude and condescending, too. There\u2019s no need for it. Don\u2019t be so sensitive. I clicked on your post because I\u2019ve seen the movie, but your attitude doesn\u2019t make me want to discuss it with you.",

I wholly agree with you that is it unconventional for most viewers but I\u2019m not trying to get anyone to watch it. I\u2019m starting a dialogue between people who have already seen it. I\u2019m not selling anything here. \n\nIt is an art peice as you alluded to and it\u2019s not for everyone. However, it was for me. I want to know your interpretation of it instead of your interpretation of my post. \n\nMy apologies if I came off rude, I just was eye-rolled as given no reason really. I understand where you are coming from now, but you are mistaken to the point of this post. Engage in the dialogue with the meaning and making of this movie. But don\u2019t criticise my motive or means of posting it, it\u2019s meaningless",

I've put in on my projector a couple of times now enjoying it as a sort of company.  I think I feel similar feelings around Henry Moore sculptures. There seems a sensitivity to being in a landscape of things or a perpetual presence or something more pervasive than narratives or individual occurrences of things. Like being in nature.\n\nIt's one of those things that has layer that I'm sure could be witnessed in many ways.",

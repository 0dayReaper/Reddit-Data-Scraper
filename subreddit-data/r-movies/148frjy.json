Its a bit against his \"manchild\" type, and its the on;y movie to really take advantage of the fact so much of his comedy was musical. \n\nIt never seems to get the love of some of his other comedies, and I wonder if it is because it feels a bit more like a \"traditional\" Rom Com. \n\nI think Wedding Singer takes all his best attributes and puts them on display. Personally, I find a lot of his movies hard to watch as I have gotten older, but I still love The Wedding Singer.",

Funny enough\" but now as I'm getting older I can relate way more and on top of that the 2010's nostalgia of the movie reminds me of the nostalgia that the characters are dealing with, it a real full circle thing",

Spanglish, Funny People, Uncut Gems are all excellent performances from him and they very rarely have him going into his yelling man-child tantrums (which are fun, but would be completely out of place).\n\nIt's very satisfying that as his career has progressed, Sandler has not only learned different gears to tap in to, but has grown and (for lack of a better term) matured with his core audience. As they/I have grown from stupid teenager to young adult to parent to parent of teens to empty nester, his film topics have evolved with that.",

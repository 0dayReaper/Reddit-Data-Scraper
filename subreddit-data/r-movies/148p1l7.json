    "postText": "Charlie and the chocolate factory, hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, King Kong, dawn of the dead, are some that come to mind. \n\nSomething about the remakes of this era I like a lot. They all had really good and focused artistic vision, that were faithful to the source material, had a good and convincing mix of cgi and practical effects (especially HHGTTG which is sort of a remake of the show of the radio show/book. The visuals were really good) and had a great way of modernizing these stories in my opinion in a way that didn\u2019t change too much\n\nDo you agree and if so what are some other examples?????",

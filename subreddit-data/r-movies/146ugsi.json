    "postText": "So in 1995, Casino dropped in November and a month later, Heat came to theaters. Arguably two of DeNiro\u2019s best performances and it go me thinking, was 1995 the last great year of his iconic career?\n\nI know we had Meet the Parents a couple years following this and some other kind of hits here and there. But all that said, there\u2019s no way he reached these heights again, right?\n\nThe mid-00s were littered with half baked films of a wide variety of genres and I think ones like City By the Sea, Showtime, Hide &amp; Seek and Righteous Kill are poor imitations of prior films that hoped to recapture the magic that previously was his performances. \n\nCurious what everyone else thinks. I should also say he is one of my favorite actors and I find all the eras of his career fascinating. I just think that the one-two punch of Casino &amp; Heat marked the end of the \u201cclassic\u201d era of his amazing career.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

            "comment": "Funny because I was just thinking about this after realizing Heat and Casino came out in the same year.  To have those two come out in one year in crazy but after that, yea it seems like he went more some comedies/silly stuff or mediocre crime drama/thrillers.\n\nSome notable good movies - Copland, Ronin, The Score, Analyze This and a supporting role in Silver Linings came after but Heat and Casino were probably his last truly great movies.",

I also need to rewatch Casino.\n\nPer your other sidebar conversation, I do feel like The Score was the last movie I really felt like he was still classic De Niro.  Jackie Brown also phenomenal in that but he played an older role. He fell into other roles after that probably on account of age. Obviously great actor.",

It's such a great performance because it's a committed performance in terms of his anger and his intimidation, but it's also funny as hell. It feels like both a tribute and a parody of his gangster roles, and Bobby D did a great job dancing on the fine line between both. 1998 also had Ronin. Not a difficult role like his others, but De Niro still owned it.\n\nI agree the 2000s were a weak decade, but he started coming back with stronger roles in the 2010s, such as Limitless and especially Silver Linings Playbook.",

For all the hullabaloo in here about critics underestimating comedies, well it seems many people online do the same thing. You never hear comedies rated on the same level as a Serious Movie.\n\nIn fact, I'd argue his best \"dramatic\" work was even before the 90s. A lot of his 90s films are his BEST films, but that doesn't mean they were his best performances. He'd been playing variations of the same character by the time the 90s came around. The comedies actually let him stretch his persona a bit.",

That's what some people were saying. People who didn't have their heads up their asses knew those were great films, just like some people know that The Irishman is perhaps his best film ever, and Killers of the Flower Moon looks amazing.\n\nNo, I don't agree with you.

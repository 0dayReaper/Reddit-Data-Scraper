            "comment": "Been following the whole Disney Live Action Saga\n\nThe Little Mermaid is in my opinion the third best Disney LA remake. It definitely shocked me that it was decent.\n\nHowever, it cost $250 million (before marketing) and it's probably going to $550-$605 million by its end run. That is basically a financial flop.\n\nThe live remakes have generally made money more overseas than domestically.\n\nThe Little Mermaid domestically is making about the same as Aladdin 2019 did. But it's pretty much dead overseas.\n\nI think the reason why this is the case is because these movies are no longer an event to watch in theaters. With Disney+ and the oversaturation of these movies, nobody cares about them anymore.\n\nFurthermore, whenever Disney makes a sequel of a remake, (Alice in Wonderland 2, Maleficient 2)  the sequel massively underperforms at the box office. Proving that people only watch the LA movies for nostalgia, and so they have no interest in watching the sequel of a remake.\n\nTherefore, Disney can only make a profit out of the initial adaptations unlike with the animated movies where they can make money from sequels.\n\nJust like with Westerns, Dystopia movies, and Disaster movies, the era of big budget Disney live action remakes is nearing a close.\n\nI give maybe at most five 5 years, that should be enough flops for Disney to realize nobody gives a crap about these movies anymore.",

                                    "comment": "Or it could be because Looking Glass was a genuinely bad movie. Alice In Wonderland wasn't necessarily a *good* movie, but it was a crowd pleasing one that did its job well. Looking Glass was a bad movie and wasn't crowd pleasing at all. That's most likely why it failed.\n\nSimilarly, Meleficent 2 was a sequel to a movie that was at best highly divisive, and the sequel was poorly received, overall. This has nothing to do with them being sequels to live action remakes/adaptations and everything to do with them being bad sequels to movies that weren't particularly well received in the first place.",

    "postText": "The movie is like one of the most realistic depictions of how I\u2019d think something like that would happen. You can feel every inch of terror. Along with the horrifying imagery and sounds. I love the scene where they recognize it doesn\u2019t have a shield anymore and they take one of it down.\n\nI remember the first time I heard the classic horn of the Martians. It\u2019s such a fantastic movie that I was shocked when I saw the Rotten Tomatoes which I know I shouldn\u2019t trust, and neither should you. What do you guys think of the movie?",

The acting, direction, and cinematography are really quite good and it\u2019s hard to really find a fault in the execution.  I think some people hate on it for wanting it to be something that was never intended - some overt social commentary (to me the allegory is fully understood), or a reimagined version or the original.  The only real flaw I saw was the part where they are at Tim and his ex\u2019s house - none of that made much sense. I\u2019ve watched it a few times now and it\u2019s always entertaining enough for me",

Whatever faults it may have (annoying children, frustrating pacing) it's a unique and memorable take on the alien invasion genre.\n\nI could have done without the whole 9/11 analogy thing. It doesn't really work. The original War of the Worlds was an analogy for European imperialism, i.e. showing up one day and invading countries with technology light years beyond what the natives have to defend themselves with. The analogy fails when it comes to terrorism because, whatever tactics they're using, they're certainly not more technologically advanced than the governments they're fighting.",

Having the son go off to join the military and be killed but then showing up alive at the end for example.\n\nThe first half of the film works really well but it peters out after the riverboat scene.  It feels like a lot of the themes of the book were sacrificed for a 12+ rating.\n\nIt is probably the best adaptation of Wells novel, still one of the best science fiction books ever written, but still feels like a missed opportunity.",

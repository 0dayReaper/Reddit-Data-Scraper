    "postText": "There's a lot of talk these days on Hollywood's obsession with spin offs, prequels and spiritual sequels, you could argue on whether the industry is more or less creatively spent than 20 years ago (which is interesting) but that's not my question.\n\nWhat in your opinion are some series that are just finished, have nowhere to go and need to end? I'd go with....\n\nAlien - I don't know what else there is to do with the series, more aliens killing people? Ideally we needed a better sequel to Prometheus than what Alien: Covenant was to really tie things together but the chance has gone, time to leave it.\n\nCharlie's Angels - just feels dated, it never really does numbers these days.\n\nJurassic World/Park - no official news on new movies but wouldn't be surprised if studios are planning something.",

If you adjust for inflation, each film in that franchise makes less than the one before it. Prometheus is the only time they bucked that trend (third highest instead of fifth), and without using \"Alien\" in the title, which I think was a sign to abandon the franchise and make Prometheus 2. Dumb Fox execs forced Ridley to make an Alien prequel instead, and surprise: it was the lowest grossing film in the series.\n\nThey screwed up big time. They ruined a viable new franchise by making it a prequel to a declining franchise. And made one of the most infuriating sequels in history.\n\nFranchises I'm tired of:\n\n* All horror franchises have been done to death\n* Harry Potter\n* Fast and Furious",

David, the creation of the creation, kills the engineers with their own weapon, then sets out to kill humans with an evolved version he creates. What more could you possibly want?",

One of if not the best Trilogies of all time and even I loved it, but even that was far from a perfect adaptation and although I don't 100% agree, I can understand why Christopher Tolkien hated the films.\n\nThe thing about the LOTR Trilogy is that despite it really making a show of the War, Which JRR really detested as seen in the Hobbit BOOK (book, not films. Very important distinction), it still at least show the horrors of it and why it shouldn't happen. The needless bloodshed, the cruel fates, the grief that so many loved ones must endure. \n\nWhen the Hobbit came out, f*ck it all, let's make a show out of the war as an epic battle film. What's that? Tolkien specifically wrote \"I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory\"? Screw that, let's glorify the F out of the war only mentioned in the book and turn it into a 2 hour film.\n\nAnd I'm not even gonna try to bring up the atrocities they pulled out of rings of power. Foremost, Amazon didn't even really try adapting Tolkien's works out of respect or passion. They just did it because they couldn't buy the rights to A song of Ice and fire.. Like c'mon! \n\nI'm happy with Lord of the Rings. I'd be more than happy if we ever get a good adaptation of Silmarillion in one way shape or form, but I'd rather Hollywood just stop with the entire Middle earth mythology now than risk more of Tolkien's works getting butchered.\n\n\nThen star wars. I loved star wars as a kid, but recently its clear they have no idea where they want to take the story and are just producing stuff for no other reason than \"product\". They don't care about good stories, they just want you in the seats while they bank off your nostalgia for the original. Seriously, Episodes 7 to 9 is the worst Trilogy I've ever seen. Not a single good movie except movie 7 which doesn't even deserve it because it's nothing but a lesser version of a new hope.",

            "comment": "If you've ever read some of the expanded universe material for Aliens, that property *absolutely* still has untapped cinematic potential. Earth Hive / Female War are extremely fertile creative territory. One of the series' key themes is corporate malfeasance, but we've never seen where that can go if allowed to run unchecked. Ripley did literally everything she could to keep the alien out of Company hands - what happens when there's no Ripley?\n\nBut the thing with so many franchises is - has it been pushed over a creative cliff by bad sequels? With the Alien series, one of the directions with the most potential was always *origin* - where did they come from, and what is the pilot species that made the original derelict. But Prometheus and Covenant have detonated that line of inquiry, retconning various aspects of the original film to imply that the alien species is just a few years old, and the pilot is a Chariots Of The Gods proto-human (or Michael Fassbender). Not only does it arguably limit creative progression, but it's a direction that most fans strongly dislike.\n\nSimilarly - personally I feel very soured on Star Wars after the direction they took with Luke Skywalker, the Jedi order and galactic politics in the sequel trilogy. That property feels like scorched earth, and will take a lot to get me back in the cinema. Like Alien, that was a property with a wealth of cinematic potential in the expanded universe, much of which was axed by the more recent material.\n\nJurassic Park... I'd argue the series does still have potential. The narrative has progressed to the point that dinosaurs live in modern ecosystems alongside people, not just as an isolated experiment or a time-travel shenanigan. While you could easily make an unrelated movie with dinosaurs, it would require jumping through some pretty big expositional hoops to reach that same state.\n\nBut it's had films that are not critically loved, and made some iffy creative decisions that give the series baggage. The Jurassic series is now largely stuck with what people thought dinosaurs looked like in 1993, and arguably became the modern equivalent of the Pteranodon-snatching-Ursula-Andress nonsense that gave dinosaur movies a bad name until Spielberg and Don Bluth came along. So if making any more movies in that series, and I'm ambivalent on that, it would need to be with a far more skilled creative team.",

Similarly James Cameron is at least partially to blame for the Terminator shenanigans as well, though really I didn't *hate* any of the Terminator films.  \n\nThe one I think they really have to stop making and should have stopped making ages ago, is The *Fast &amp; Furious* franchise.  I stopped watching it after 7 and even that was too long to keep watching them.  Apparently they have made *four* more movies since!  WTF?",

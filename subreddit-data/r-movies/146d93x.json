    "postText": "I recently watched Silver Streak for the first time, a movie I've long known as a great Wilder/Pryor buddy movie. I've seen almost all of their other movies together, as well as a few clips of them in this movie, so I was excited to see the whole thing.\n\nBy the time Richard Pyror finally shows up, we're an hour into an hour and fifty minute long movie.\n\nI wa surprised and so I thought I'd ask if there are any famous movies that were totally different from the expectations you always had of them.",

We used to sing Greased Lightning a lot in assembly in primary school, but it must have been a heavily censored version, because I was shocked when I watched the film for the first time as an adult and saw how sexual that song is.\n\n* Donnie Darko. Thought it was a load of shit. \n\n\n* Brokeback Mountain. The media really overplayed the gay sex scenes and I was expecting something incredibly erotic, but it's actually a really serious drama. Do not go into this film expecting hot gay action. They kiss once and you see a shaky tent. That is all.\n\n\n* The Prestige. Overall enjoyed it, but by the end, the lengths they were going to, to outdo each other, were just so ridiculous that by the final fifteen minutes I stopped being impressed, because all the main characters were just completely emotionally backward.  Like ok you've proved you're the best magician, but you've also destroyed the lives of everyone around you, so I'm less wowed by their genius and just thinking they're dicks.",

Then as the Bob Ross part kept going, I found myself actually enjoying it and forgetting there would even be a teaser. I couldve kept watching just the Bob Ross spoof. So when the teaser portion hit in the middle I was pleasantly surprised. The visuals look great and definitely make me want to see this movie. It gives that same comedic vibe but also looked serious, or that it will have consequences, which I really dug.\n\nSo pumped for this.",

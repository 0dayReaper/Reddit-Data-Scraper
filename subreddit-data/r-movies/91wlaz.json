            "comment": "&gt; Stoned Alone is reminiscent of that hallowed comedy classic. It centers around a twenty-something weed growing loser who misses the plane for his holiday ski trip. He makes the best of things by getting high. Paranoia sets in and he believes he hears someone break into his house. Turns out thieves have broken in. Fully stoned and fueled by paranoia, he tries to thwart the thieves and defend his castle.\n\nLol I guess it's one of those 'so crazy it might work' things, like most of Ryan Reynolds' upcoming movies (I'm looking at you, *Detective Pikachu* &amp; *Clue*). I bet he ends up starring in this too.",

Streaming Services would provide a perfect platform, it's low effort, low commitment, and low risk TV watching, so it's great for when you just want to watch *something*. I get that feeling a lot after i make some food and I want to just chill out and watch something while I'm eating. Especially when I'm high, which definitely helps with some of these movies.",

Paranoia sets in and he believes he hears someone break into his house. Turns out thieves have broken in....\n&gt;\n\nI was half expecting that no one has broken in and it's whole movie of him being paranoid high around an empty house\n",

He's forgotten his outside light on and is super fucking baked as kids keep showing up in costumes asking for candy. Paranoia takes hold and he boobytraps the house with a bunch of stuff you'd expect a stoner to set up. Two of his friends stop by to visit like they do almost every night, and get caught in the stoner traps.",

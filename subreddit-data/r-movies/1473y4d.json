    "postText": "So I've been a Letterboxd user for a while now and as much as I love the platform I feel lately it's becoming, for lack of a better phrase, too popular. I used to appreciate the movie ratings people posted there so I use the wisdom of the crowd to get a relatively nuanced and in-depth estimation of whether I want to watch a particular film, or how popular it is in the more artistically-focused film community, especially since it felt like mostly cinephiles and hardcore film enthusiasts were on the platform. Now it feels it's gradually becoming more and more like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes, where general audience trends dictate the score along with bots and paid reviews by studios, and shallow criticism.\n\nSo I was wondering if maybe there are similar platforms with more specialized community that I can trust to indicate what I should give my time to, both in terms of quality and popularity (but not simply box office numbers). Do any exist?\n\nAny recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your input, and happy watching!",

Find a group of people on there with opinions you value and follow them. Then you can look at their ratings/reviews.",

I do look at other \"user reviews\", but only after I've written my own.\n\nI started this calendar year and only log movies that are \"new to me\" watched in 2023, so no rewatches and no logging movies that I watched prior to Jan 1, 2023. I'm at 60 so far for the year and I think it's cool to see it and cool to even go back and see what I wrote about any one of them.\n\nI personally don't use it to discover movies. Or put too much stock into what others are saying. Sometimes I might comment on a review, and some people will comment on mine. But that social aspect isn't the draw. It's the logging itself.",

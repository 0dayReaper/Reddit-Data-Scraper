They come and go, and the one that ultimately ends up on their front page could be different if they decide it's worth the budget. This poster isn't going to hang in cinema hallways for 3-9 months like they used to.\n\nI think it's just a graphics company is being given a tiny budget and tiny timeframe to make *SOMETHING*",

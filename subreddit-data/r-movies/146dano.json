    "postText": "I've just finished watching the 1967 film In Cold Blood. I'd been meaning to watch the movie for a long time but kept forgetting until today when it happened to be on one of my movie channels and so I grabbed some popcorn and started watching.\n\nIt's a very good movie. It's not what I expected. I mean it has, I don't know to say it, a documentary feel to it. The black and white color and the way the events are narrated certainly adds to that feeling. And even though you know what's going to happen, or perhaps *because* you know, it's the more unsettling to watch them eventually commit the crime. And the &gt;!execution scene at the end!&lt; felt almost real and was terrifying.\n\nAre there crime movies based on true events or at least inspired by them that you really enjoyed watching?",

It\u2019s stars Melanie Lynskey in her first screen role (she was 16 at the time) and Cate Winslet. It might have been Winslet\u2019s screen debut too. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my favorite work of this genre but it\u2019s definitely worth seeking out.",

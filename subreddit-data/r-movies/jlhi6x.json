Through a couple of family friend coincidences I went on some family vacations as a kid pretty close to where he\u2019d settled down on New Providence Island.\n\nFrom what I saw he seemed like a very private but genuinely nice and happy old guy. Played a lot of golf, rum drink after the game, then home to walk his flock of terriers.\n\nWhen I was about 10 my dad was playing golf on a busy day on the course and happened to be one group behind Sir Sean, so they crossed paths waiting on the tee a couple of times. Now my dad loves James Bond and had already started passing that love onto me, so after the game my dad called our hotel room and said, \u201cHoney, tell WebberWoods to come over to the locker room bar right now!\u201d So I did.\n\nI walked onto the bar\u2019s patio to see my dad at the same table as Sir Sean participating in the rum drink part of his daily ritual and was instantly star stuck like only a 10 year old can be.\n\nDad: WebberWoods! Come on over, I\u2019d like you to meet Sir Sean.\n\nSean (big smile and trademark voice): Hiya!\n\nMe (shaking with fear and excitement): ...hello\n\nSean: I hear you like my moviesh!\n\nMe: ...yes \n\nSean: Which of my moviesh do you like the besht?\n\nMy entire body went rigid with fear as I suddenly realized that if I was honest he would surely think that my dad was a bad parent for showing a 10 year old Goldfinger. I tried to think of kid friendly movies he made and went completely blank.\n\nMe (sheer terror): A-all of them!\n\nSean: Well that\u2019sh a very diplomatic anshwer my boy!\n\nDad: Webb, what are you talking about? You\u2019ve seen Goldfinger what...ten times? \n\n*Father, no!*\n\nAnyway, I ended up babbling through my thought process and we all had a good laugh and from that day forward my answer to grown ups asking me what I wanted to be when I grew up changed from \u2018dinosaur\u2019 to \u2018movie star\u2019\n\nRIP Sir Sean!",

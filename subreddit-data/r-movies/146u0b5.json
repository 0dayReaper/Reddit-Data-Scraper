    "postText": "\n\nA few weeks ago i've watched Blow Out by John Travolta. I'm not by any means saying that nobody knows it, but this movie doesn't 50% of the exposure that Pulp Fiction, Grease and Saturday Night Fever have. It's a really good neo noir, the final dialogue line is very memorable.\n\nAlso, i don't see a lot of people talking about Frailty, starring Matthew McConaughey, as it should be. This movie has one of the best plot twists ever.\n\nAnother mention is, This Boy's Life, DiCaprio is so good here for his age.\n\n(Pardon for my grammar).",

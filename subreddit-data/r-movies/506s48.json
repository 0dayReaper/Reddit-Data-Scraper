DeMille. It got pretty gritty. I started to hear the word \"draw\" in my sleep. Then one day, I was just walking down the street when I heard a voice behind me say, \"Reach for it, mister!\" I spun around... and there I was, face to face with a six-year old kid. Well, I just threw my guns down and walked away. Little bastard shot me in the ass. So I limped to the nearest saloon, crawled inside a whiskey bottle, and I've been there ever since.\"\n\nGodspeed to the Waco Kid. ",

            "comment": "This may get buried, but seeing how many people were affected by his work, I wanted to share this story. \n\nI got to meet Gene Wilder in 2010. I was a waiter at a restaurant in NYC and his godson was having a private birthday party in the back room of our restaurant. I had been advised that he was an amateur sommelier and was bringing the wine for dinner. When Mr. Wilder arrived, he couldn't have been kinder. He asked my recommendation for a white wine before dinner and then for an entree suggestion based on the red wine he'd brought for the party. He made it a point to sincerely let me know he enjoyed both of my recommendations after they had arrived. \n\nHe was accompanied by his wife, Karen Boyer, with whom he was affectionate and attentive. He made time to speak with all the guests at dinner with the most gentle and considerate demeanor. \n\nAt the end of dinner, the guests took turns making toasts. When it was Mr. Wilder's turn, he simply stood up and opened his mouth to sing a few bars of a made up song. The only words were, \"I love you, love you, love you, yes I love you, love you, love you.\" I got big tears in my eyes. He was humble, kind, so full of love for his family and friends. I had the opportunity to peer into the life of one of my favorite comedians, and he was every bit as grand as I had imagined. Rest in Peace, Mr. Wilder. Thank you for all the laughs.     ",

Since production had started they didn't really have time for additional casting. \n\nGene stepped in and absolutely killed it. ",

Not really knowing what to do, I just turned on Blazing Saddles as a comfort movie and my wife and I sat there in silence. She'd never seen the movie before and had no idea it was a comedy, and after about 10 minutes, she turned to me and said, \"wait... were westerns really this racist?\". It made me burst out laughing and made the whole thing more manageable.\n\nI hope he knew how much happiness he brought into this world.",

I\u2019ll tell you everything I think, without censoring, and you take from my opinion what you like.\n\n&gt;I assume that the designer took his impressions from the book and didn\u2019t know, naturally, who would be playing Willy. And I think, for a character in general, they\u2019re lovely sketches.\n\n&gt;I love the main thing \u2014 the velvet jacket \u2014 and I mean to show by my sketch the exact same color. But I\u2019ve added two large pockets to take away from the svelt, feminine line. (Also in case of a few props.)\n\n&gt;I also think the vest is both appropriate and lovely.\n\n&gt;And I love the same white, flowing shirt and the white gloves. Also the lighter colored inner silk lining of the jacket.\n\n&gt;What I don\u2019t like is the precise pin pointing in place and time as this costume does.\n\n&gt;I don\u2019t think of Willy as an eccentric who holds on to his 1912 Dandy\u2019s Sunday suit and wears it in 1970, but rather as just an eccentric \u2014 where there\u2019s no telling what he\u2019ll do or where he ever found his get-up \u2014 except that it strangely fits him: Part of this world, part of another. A vain man who knows colors that suit him, yet, with all the oddity, has strangely good taste. Something mysterious, yet undefined.\n\n&gt;I\u2019m not a ballet master who skips along with little mincy steps. So, as you see, I\u2019ve suggested ditching the Robert Helpmann trousers. Jodhpurs to me belong more to the dancing master. But once elegant now almost baggy trousers \u2014 baggy through preoccupation with more important things \u2014 is character.\n\n&gt;Slime green trousers are icky. But sand colored trousers are just as unobtrusive for your camera, but tasteful.\n\n&gt;The hat is terrific, but making it 2 inches shorter would make it more special.\n\n&gt;Also a light blue felt hat-band to match with the same light blue fluffy bow tie shows a man who knows how to compliment his blue eyes.\n\n&gt;To match the shoes with the jacket is fey. To match the shoes with the hat is taste.\n\n&gt;Hope all is well. Talk to you soon.\n\n&gt;All my best,\n\n&gt;Gene\n\n[SOURCE](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/part-of-this-world-part-of-another.html)",

After the crowd sees Willy Wonka is a cripple, they all whisper to themselves and then become deathly quiet. As I walk toward them, my cane sinks into one of the cobblestones I'm walking on and stands straight up, by itself; but I keep on walking, until I realize that I no longer have my cane. I start to fall forward, and just before I hit the ground, I do a beautiful forward somersault and bounce back up, to great applause.\" Asked why, Wilder said, \"Because from that time on, no one will know if I'm lying or telling the truth.\"\n\n[Source](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/part-of-this-world-part-of-another.html)",

She\u2019ll be able to deliver the puppies.\u2019\n\nDibby\u2019s cousin said, \u2018Keep her alive.\u2019\n\nSo the vet sewed up her backside and over the next week the dog learned to walk.\n\nShe didn\u2019t spend any time worrying, she just learned to walk by taking two steps in the front and flipping  up her backside, and then taking two steps and flipping up her backside again.\n\nShe gave birth to six little puppies, all in perfect health.  She nursed them and then weaned them.\n\nAnd when they learned to walk, they all walked like her.\u201d",

Creating laughter when I was sad, inspiring admiration for the work he could do and bringing me a bit more joy with every film I watched.   \n   \nFrom first seeing him in Willy Wonka with bewilderment and amazement, laughing at his Leo in Producers, fearing his Frankenstein, admiring his shooting hand in \"Blazing Saddles\", wishing I was half the lover he was in [\"The Worlds Greatest Lover\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efyOVGixT-E) and hoping someday I could be as smart as him in [\"The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother\"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072608/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_19). Add on to that, his works with Richard Prior and you just saw magic happen every single time.   \n    \nWhile he, like any person, was a man with faults; I could not deny that he was, for me, **always** a pleasure to watch and, in many ways, and inspiration. Going to miss you Mr. Wilder. ",

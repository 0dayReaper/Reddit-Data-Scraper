    "postText": "It was filmed in summer 1999 and was essentially Young Guns 2.0 with late 90s stars including James Van Der Beek, Ashton Kutcher, Usher and Rachael Leigh Cook.\n\nI know that Westerns are a hard sell especially over the last few decades including American Outlaws starring Colin Farrell that was also released in 2001. Though, Texas Rangers released in November 2001 and was a momentous flop grossing less than a million dollars on a 38 million dollar budget. The Rotten Tomatoes score is just two percent.\n\nWhy was it such a monumental failure?",

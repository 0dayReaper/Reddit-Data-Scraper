    "postText": "Probably common knowledge at this point but I just rewatched the first HP and my god the score is something else. Intricacies and craftsman ship are incredible. It\u2019s crazy how the memories and emotions from watching this film have been in my head since I was younger and still have the same effect to this day, the score helps bring them back out. \nThe movie in general is really something to be admired. Sets, practical effects, etc..  compare this with any modern movie and this takes the cake. Brings you into the world without the unbelievable cgi created worlds that are very common now. What are your thoughts?",

He was scoring the prequels and HP around the same so it makes sense, although I've had these movies on in the background and just listening to the music I'd do a double take \"Wait, what am I watching again?\" I think they're a bit too similar at times.\n\nRegardless, John Williams is amazing and every composer has motifs and styles they stay with them their whole life. Hans Zimmer and Ennio Morricone also have a lot of music that people have criticized as \"sounding the same\" but they're not appreciating the nuances of it.",

It left me feeling both overwhelmed and underwhelmed. \n\nI ended up watching the second half the following day. The film was original, visually a good cin\u00e9matic experience and the acting was good. I may have had too much expectations because of all the oscar wins and nominations. \n\nUltimately, I found the movie to be a repetitive journey lacking the depth I had anticipated, despite its critical acclaim.",

            "comment": "Watching a movie being conscious of the hype is usually an express ticket to a disappointing experience. I'd say watch the movie again after you've let it go for a while, and you are no longer burdened by expectations.\n\nI can say that when I got around to seeing it, I only knew it as the better multiverse movie of 2022 (the other being Dr Strange), and that it might be the best role of Michelle Yeoh's career. I didn't know how wacky it was going to get, I didn't know about the 'do weird things' gag, or that it would explore inter-cultural clashes and inter-generational trauma. I also didn't expect to tear up over rocks. Had I known more about it when I watched it, I might not have thought as highly of it, because I have an idea about how I'd want those ideas explored, and if the film didn't do what I wanted it to, I'd 'mark it down'. But having no such knowledge meant I could let the film make its case on its own terms without me pre-empting it. I think that's better.",

I just said I found it tiresome to complete. I found it wasn\u2019t entertaining to me, it\u2019s an opinion. The costumes and editing in this film are phenomenal but I found the rest of the movie to be forgettable, especially the writing.\n\nThere isn\u2019t really anything to \u201cget\u201d with this film - everything is prescribed. Unless you\u2019d like to offer an interpretation of something that was left to the viewer to decipher which I doubt. Every character clearly exposited their feelings and the story concludes in an extremely typical Hollywood \u201chappy ending\u201d\n\nIf you think that opinion is \u201ccringe\u201d or too contrarian you are welcome to do that.

That will ruin any movie experience.\n\nI don't doubt that you wouldn't like it anyway, given that the first half didn't grab you, but don't act like the movie didn't live up to you expectations when you couldn't even be bothered to sit down and watch it all at once. You neutered its impact yourself.",

The parts that were supposed to be funny did not make me laugh at all. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'\n\nAll that never really allowed me to be invested in the struggles of the kid, I disliked very much how the story was wrapped in all that .. whatever you want to call it. A cinematic hotchpotch that did not appeal to my sense of humor or sensibilities. I couldn't empathize with the characters, I did't feel sad for anybody really. I found it kind of hokey at parts.

It hit me like a brick and I tear up near the end. That\u2019s what make it great.

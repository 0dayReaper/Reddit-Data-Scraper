But this movie really is a shocking tour de force performance that got little to no critical attention or fanfare. It's an incredibly tough performance to pull off because Reynolds is having to play a ruthless murderer under the guise of not being in. control of his actions and he pulls it off flawlessly. ",

It doesn't really snap you out of it until the end when you realize this guy is not only mentally disturbed, but he may have also loved killing these women and he's invented the dog and cat characters as a way to cope with his liking to brutally murder these women. Like you said it's a brilliantly directed movie that's very deep. I think critics just didn't get the movie because the comedy aspects are not really laugh out loud funny, but more awkwardly funny. But I never really cared since Reynold's performance was so good.",

Going in I was expecting more of a sympathetic character, or more dark humour, especially given the situation around the first death, but for me it just snowballed into progressively darker places. Especially when the reality of his living conditions is shown. Upsetting, but I guess in a good way for a movie. Just not what I expected. Solid performances though; Anna Kendrick got to show off a solid range as well.",

            "comment": "Reynolds is actually a very good actor.\n\nHe makes a lot of money doing his \"schtick\", but then that allows him to do the odd indie film. Although he doesn't really do them anymore after the success of Deadpool. But then Deadpool was a genuine passion project he was trying to get made for like 10 years, so you can't begrudge him.\n\nThe Nines, Buried, Chaos Theory, Definitely Maybe, The Voices are great performances.",

I caught it late one night on probably WGN. \n\nIt's pretty good, decently funny, and the villian is David Suchet so he is there chewing up any scenery RR isn't.  I always feel like I am in the minority on this one as it was the first movie I saw with him where you could see the potential just waiting to be tapped.",

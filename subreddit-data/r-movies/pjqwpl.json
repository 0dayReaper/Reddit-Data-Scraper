This is the first teaser we all saw.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deXW5kTD9Vs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deXW5kTD9Vs)\n\nI was in college when I saw this trailer and immediately ran to my computer to go to the website which just added more questions and no answers.\n\nThen when the movie came out there was a huge push to keep the secret quiet on what the matrix really was.",

So much so that the director was tried in court on charges of making a snuff film (and for those curious to watch it, be warned there are 7 real moments of animal harm in the film), even when the actors came out and showed they were clearly still alive after breaking their confidentiality agreements people still didn't believe them. I believe the outcome was against the director and was fined for creating and distributing disturbing, obscene and distasteful material.",

It'll go through all the old plot points, and Keanu-Neo will be an interloper trying to disrupt the system from playing out the same way all over again.\n\nJust a theory!",

            "comment": "Ok I am pretty hyped for this now after crawling through the very innovative website: [https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/)\n\nIt's all written in some pretty elegant Javascript. Most likely using FFMpeg to dynamically stitch together the pieces of each iteration of the teaser.\n\nPretty-fied **app.js** that the website uses as the \"juice\" of the dynamic video: [https://paste2.org/ZY1NIxNy](https://paste2.org/ZY1NIxNy)\n\nThe code that grabs your system time, and to generate the runtime video is between lines 3939 and 4045.\n\nFrom deciphering this file I am guessing the codename of the app itself is called \"Ice Cream\" and is a WB-built thing, written specifically for this teaser trailer. It is mostly built using NUXT ([https://nuxtjs.org/](https://nuxtjs.org/)) and uses GSAP for static animations ([https://greensock.com/gsap](https://greensock.com/gsap))\n\nEach dynamic piece of the video (with the exceptions below) are generated at runtime. I've been able to capture static streams using browser extensions, but right clicking anywhere within the page itself while the video is playing will automatically boot you back to the Pill selection screen. This seems to be by design.\n\nThe actual randomised pieces that it constructs are also illusive for the time being. Somewhere inside app.js is the code that is used to actually stitch them together, but it's obfuscated and each piece has no extension, making it harder to track down in the code. It might be API based as well. I'm not well-versed in JS enough to be able to follow this properly.\n\nThere's nearly 50,000 lines to go through which, by the time I would figure out how or *where* these video pieces are, the trailer would already be out.\n\n**Intro &amp; Outro pieces:**\n\nThese 2 placeholders are just the audio + narration - the spoken time\n\n[placeholder-red.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/placeholder-red.mp4)\n\n[placeholder-blue.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/placeholder-blue.mp4)\n\nNext is the Intro and Outro \"glitches\"\n\n[teaser-intro.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-intro.mp4)\n\n[teaser-outro.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-outro.mp4)\n\n[teaser-intro-mobile.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-intro-mobile.mp4)\n\n[teaser-outro-mobile.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-outro-mobile.mp4)\n\nEnd card text about when the trailer is coming:\n\n[teaser-outro-soon.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-outro-soon.mp4)\n\n[teaser-outro-2-days.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-outro-2-days.mp4)\n\n[teaser-outro-tomorrow.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-outro-tomorrow.mp4)\n\n[teaser-outro-now.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-outro-now.mp4)\n\nJapanese:\n\n[teaser-outro-soon-jp.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-outro-soon-jp.mp4)\n\n[teaser-outro-2-days-jp.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-outro-2-days-jp.mp4)\n\n[teaser-outro-tomorrow-jp.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-outro-tomorrow-jp.mp4)\n\n[teaser-outro-now-jp.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-outro-now-jp.mp4)\n\nRussian:\n\n[teaser-outro-soon-ru.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-outro-soon-ru.mp4)\n\n[teaser-outro-2-days-ru.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-outro-2-days-ru.mp4)\n\n[teaser-outro-tomorrow-ru.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-outro-tomorrow-ru.mp4)\n\n[teaser-outro-now-ru.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/videos/teaser-outro-now-ru.mp4)\n\n**Some of the captured streams I've been able to decode:** (these might be time-bombed)\n\nRedpill:\n\n[fea792eaa4b801a8b6a4f858e46d2ce3.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/generated/v7/high/fea792eaa4b801a8b6a4f858e46d2ce3.mp4)\n\n[ac2f640e57b56d6f7db169dafb931cf9.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/generated/v7/high/ac2f640e57b56d6f7db169dafb931cf9.mp4)\n\n[d03effbc2baea850fc578ed820716bc3.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/generated/v7/high/d03effbc2baea850fc578ed820716bc3.mp4)\n\n[00fb08668bf463964a3233a787d1133b.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/generated/v7/high/00fb08668bf463964a3233a787d1133b.mp4)\n\n[5377ae221e526c9eed988537f6cc3a9b.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/generated/v7/high/5377ae221e526c9eed988537f6cc3a9b.mp4)\n\n[ce703507432bac084ee3cab226e624f6.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/generated/v7/high/ce703507432bac084ee3cab226e624f6.mp4)\n\n[9e56bda904e653ce864d21c2102875b4.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/generated/v7/high/9e56bda904e653ce864d21c2102875b4.mp4)\n\nBlue pill:\n\n[561a77852ca05c6da78bef98bae36400.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/generated/v7/high/561a77852ca05c6da78bef98bae36400.mp4)\n\n[5929ca6496807cea8b3b186d84bd84ca.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/generated/v7/high/5929ca6496807cea8b3b186d84bd84ca.mp4)\n\n[44352b626194ac1119dffb702d7f7969.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/generated/v7/high/44352b626194ac1119dffb702d7f7969.mp4)\n\n[78b62275602131768f3a186714703dfd.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/generated/v7/high/78b62275602131768f3a186714703dfd.mp4)\n\n[cb0336d070038ed073124180ac9d4417.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/generated/v7/high/cb0336d070038ed073124180ac9d4417.mp4)\n\n[0c09eaeb419bb229e03daf5fa165629d.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/generated/v7/high/0c09eaeb419bb229e03daf5fa165629d.mp4)\n\n[bc5a9e69644aba4867ed68171804a889.mp4](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/generated/v7/high/bc5a9e69644aba4867ed68171804a889.mp4)\n\nFont used on the site: [LibreBaskerville-Regular.ttf](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/_nuxt/assets/fonts/LibreBaskerville-Regular.ttf)\n\n\"4.js\" which is used as a Language file containing all the dialogue lines and UI text that is used to generate subtitles: [https://paste2.org/Odh0PPKN](https://paste2.org/Odh0PPKN)",

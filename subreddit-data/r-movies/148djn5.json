    "postText": "Hey movie fans. I'm running a small movie watching event for my close friends for 2 years now. We mainly try to watch movies which either were important to cinema's history, or movies which we feel every aspiring cinephile should watch.\n\nI as custodian of the event am mostly in charge of picking the material we're watching, and lately I've proposed that maybe we could watch one of Werner Herzog's movie. I was inspired by this material:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wn-OJSgVQs\n\nI've shown it to our club, and we've collectively decided to watch one Herzog movie.\n\nHence the question - if you were to recommend one of Werner Herzog's movies - which one would it be?\n\nThanks!",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been rewatching the 90s Disney movies recently and this is something I\u2019ve noticed that\u2019s driving me crazy, it\u2019s like we\u2019re not allowed to let the main characters have a laugh or fuck up in a relatable manner that isn\u2019t serious. \n\nYet the side characters aren\u2019t allowed to be serious and have to be silly all the time, like they don\u2019t deserve to be major players in the emotional arc of the story. So many of them then feel extraneous to the actual story\n\n-\t*Aladdin*, our main character, Jasmine, and the villain Jafar are all dour and have 0 sense of humor compared to Iago and Genie\n-\t*Beauty and the Beast*, Belle and the Beasts are completely serious and animated in such a way as well, yet Gaston, Cogsworth, Belle\u2019s father, and Lumiere are allowed to be funny and screw up.\n-\t*The Little Mermaid*, just look at the contrast between *Ariel* and *Triton* to *Sebastian* or *Flounder*\n-\t*Pochahantas* with the titular character and John Smith contrasted to her animal sidekicks.\n-\t*Tarzan* with the title character, Jane, and Kerchak contrasted with Tek and Tantor\n-\t*The Lion King* with Simba and Nala contrasted with Timon and Pumba\n\nThe only exception is *Hercules* and some characters in *Hunchback* like Phoebus and Esmeralda  \nLike it\u2019s driving me crazy why the screenwriters and animators keep doing this, and I don\u2019t know why?",

I will add though, the specific reason the comedy comes from the sideshow characters (Iago, Cogs and Lumiere, the raccoon and dog in Pocahontas) is, to me a matter of practicality.\n\nThe comedy itself is a sideshow, one that was often subplotted (think of the raccoon and dog having their chase when the dog was taking its bath in Pocahontas). The screentime for the primary characters however, is taken up by plot advancement. I.e. screentime of the main characters cant be wasted with them doing frivolous things. To make it kid friendly though, a funny character is added that does frivolous things which are not plot relevant.",

As the fire raged on, Nero even opened up his own gardens to provide a temporary home for those who were now homeless.  He also ordered the construction of emergency accommodation and cut the price of corn, as well as provided food directly, so that people could eat.  Besides this, he paid for much of these relief efforts out of his own pocket.",

So because they saw Nero as one of these types, I believe he was taking music lessons, they used it as slander against him to make him look weak. The whole \"Nero played the fiddle while Rome burned\" was never meant to be literal, atleast not to most that had knowledge of the events, it was more to say \"this is what happens when these weak artsy types are in charge\"",

At the time Rome was a very \"masculine military man War machine =good\" and \"art and philosophy=bad\" same as our current cultural splits almost. So it just depends on whose narrative you hear, the truth is usually in between with loads of added context",

In later centuries the fact he percecuted Christians didn\u2019t help. And this is something that\u2019s ignored these days, Nero wasn\u2019t really great emperor even if he didn\u2019t fiddle and there was much worse ones, and much worse treatment of Christians later on too during Crisis of third century. He didn\u2019t really have any accomplishments and was known for wanting to be entertainer which made the Senate look down on him, his mother Agrippina was more competent. \n\nAnd now its just Nero being added to list of terrible emperors so bad things get repeated.",

I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in Trinidad and I went to Jamaica to research, and I did a lot of voice work with Chris Walker and with the late Tony Hall, to try to get the voice right. But more than the voice, the thing about a dialect is that everybody\u2019s voice is actually very different, so consistency is really more important than accuracy. Your speech pattern is based on culture, and that was the thing I didn\u2019t wanna let down",

    "postText": "The Movie Starts with a guy with his wife and two babies buying a house that was rebuilt after a devastating fire. But just like any ghost movie, it's haunted. The ghost is a chill, layback shadow figure who had died when the house burnt down. Throughout the movie, the ghost would play supernatural pranks on the owners until they install cameras and the ghost starts turning off the cameras. Until the climax when they bring a priest in and he finally shows himself in front of everyone. The ending of the movie would be the ghost and the guy just chilling in the living room watching TV together. The post credit scene would be like when the babies are teenagers and tryna learn more about the ghost and the movie ends.",

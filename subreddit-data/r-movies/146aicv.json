    "postText": "Is there any movie which tells how a crime family is formed or the feuds between other crime syndicates to keep one in the position?Most of the movies are like Godfather trilogy, which is revolving around an existing crime family. \n\nI got the inspiration from Gerhardt Crime syndicate in Fargo (TV) . And Thomas Shelby of peaky blinders \n\n\nAnother one on the similar genre is Hatfield and mccoy.\n\nIf it had a great cinematography and a good pace , its a bonus.",

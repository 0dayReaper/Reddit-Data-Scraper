    "postText": "Rewatching lord of the rings and the Hobbit really got me thinking. Since the Hobbit in total added like 1 whole hour of extra content and Lord of the Rings added 2 hours.\n\nI was wondering what other films have a lot of added content in their extended cut and how different that would make the films. On one hand, I can think the extended cut could either make the fine pacing drag, or flesh out the rushed pacing in the theatrical. Or that the extended could just have a whole new side plot not present in the theatrical. \n\nI wanted to mention Zack Snyder's Justice League, but that's like a completely different movie on its own.",

It's probably the best visual representation of the Dune universe that has been put to film (apart from a few things like ornithoptors, and the obviously dated 1980s special effects). It really captures the feel of a universe that developed interstellar spaceflight without the use of advanced computers. However, it completely butchers the plot, it's obvious that someone (either Lynch or the studio) didn't understand the underlying themes of the book at all (the deconstruction of the Hero's Journey), and has real trouble adapting the voluminous amount of internal monologues the book contains into something that works on the screen (Lynch opts to literally convert them to whispered voiceover).\n\nVilleneuve's movie(s), while not as visually bizarre and alien, is superior in everything that matters. He actually understands Herbert's messages in the book, is able to convey the monologues visually through his actor's performances, and the plot follows the book really well (with the exclusion of a couple plot points - the book is so dense, it's understandable). I really hope Warner allows him to do Dune Messiah and Children of Dune.",

It's based on a fictionalized account of U-96's seventh war patrol, the translated logbook of which is available here:  [https://www.uboatarchive.net/U-96/KTB96-7.htm](https://www.uboatarchive.net/U-96/KTB96-7.htm)\n\nThe events described in the movie are greatly exaggerated over real life.  For example, the commander of U-96 during that patrol, KpLt Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock didn't die:  He lived to 734 years old, dying in 1986, and he actually served as a technical advisor for the film.\n\nPlus, the author of the novel the film is based on says it wasn't a realistic portrayal.   They got the technical details down pat, but the behavior of the actors were completely wrong:\n\n[http://www.cs.ovgu.de/\\~junghans/dasboot/inhalt.html](http://www.cs.ovgu.de/~junghans/dasboot/inhalt.html)\n\nAnd it's not just the author, a bunch of former U-boat sailors say it wasn't like that either.  Here is a scholarly work discussing that, and the other problems with Das Boot:   \n\n[https://www.jstor.org/stable/441638?seq=1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/441638?seq=1)",

The 300 minute miniseries becomes a 293 minute movie when you remove all the recaps and episode credits.\n\nHonestly, the 208 minute Director's Cut is the best version to watch unless you can actually find the episodic miniseries edit (which has now been released on Blu-Ray in Europe). The unbroken \"Uncut Version\" movie is a bit much; the natural breaks in the miniseries version of it make it an easier watch.",

But I do still generally believe that people rely on critiquing \u201cplot holes\u201d when they have deeper issues with a movie. \n\nNearly every movie you\u2019ll ever see will have some lapses in logic or internal inconsistencies. But these only become a problem when the viewer is not otherwise engaged enough to suspend their disbelief. Nobody starts tallying the coincidences in Star Wars because they\u2019re having too much fun to care. The problem arises when a movie fails to engage the audience enough to distract them from the gaps in logic. \n\nIf you\u2019re walking out of a movie thinking about \u201cWhy didn\u2019t [character] just do [action] instead?\u201d then the movie didn\u2019t do its job. Noticing the \u201cplot holes\u201d is a symptom of you not liking a movie, not the cause. \n\nI think it\u2019s become common on the internet to try to eviscerate movies based on plot holes as a way of feeling superior, but that\u2019s so boring and lazy. You have to dig into the deeper failings of a movie to understand why the plot holes were so distracting.",

This is a common structure of story. \n\nYou can't build the conflict if the reason for conflict is stupid in the context of the world you built. Audience will buy into the world, but they need to be convinced that the conflict is unavoidable or unsolvable by a simple method.\n\nSimilarly, when you build a world and a conflict, audience expects to find clever solution for conflict resolution that will be consistent with the world/premise/characters you built. If you can't solve the conflict in consistent/logical way, it's a bad story.\n\nPlot holes are real and legitimate complaints about bad stories. People will have different level of immersion and ability to find gaps, but that's not an excuse to get away with shit story and sloppy world building. You can't blame people for engaging in your story and questioning why didn't X do Y?",

Like the waterfall thing -- a lot of people (myself included) have asked why they don't just move next to a waterfall. But if you actually think about that, there are plenty of reasons -- like what are they gonna do, build a house?\n\nThe movie's main themes are about moving on beyond the horror of the world around them and living a normal-ish life in spite of that. In this context, it makes perfect sense that they wouldn't move, or that they would have another kid (although also, this point is straight up not a plot hole, because what are they supposed to do abort? She would die, there's no doctors). *But* if that theme isn't resonating enough, then it begins to falter.\n\nThe movie is so heavily focused on the mechanics of staying alive, but the characters also want to live normal lives. This could be an interesting dynamic, but the script fails to engage with it. Unless you like the movie of course, in which case rhe script succeeded -- we can have different opinions.\n\nI found the sequel's greatest sin was failing to capitalize on our emotional investment in the family, and instead introducing a new boring white guy to replace the dead boring white guy. Except unlike Krasinski's character, new guy has no established connection to the other characters, and is thus... just really uninteresting and forgettable. Emily Blunt is *right there!* Just let her do things!",

When we find out the client's actual reason for putting together the mission, it makes zero sense. There was never any reason to send in the freelancers because the client had his own team capable of accomplishing the true objective, which they do. The casino heist is pointless and always was, because the client never cared about the money in the vault. In fact, the freelance mercs undermine the mission, which is a completely predictable consequence of sending people who have been lied to about its purpose.\n\nThe movie is just so incompetently written that it starts with the premise of \"zombie heist\" but has no idea how to make it relevant to the story it actually tells. In a case such as this, plot holes are a substantial matter.",

I have a reputation for hating everything that I watch or play among my friend groups because I can very easily get distracted by something that wants to be taken seriously but doesn\u2019t deserve it. \n\n\nThe last movie I saw like that was John Wick 4, which was supposed to be his last hurrah, all serious. It was doing an alright job for the first two acts. But when he gets to the car chase in Paris, it throws every attempt at realism out the window. This is a movie series that started off counting every shot fired so he could accurately reload. Now he\u2019s getting hit by car after car after car. Hell, even a dog gets hit by a car. Car crashes operate on Fast and the Furious logic in this movie. Then he falls off the fourth story and walks it off. Then he falls down 200 stairs in a Loony Tunes gag that was out of place in this movie, and then it ends with a duel where he shoots someone not even participating in the duel, which allows both sides to win\u2026which is not how duels work even slightly. The movie wants to be taken seriously.\n\n\nThis is where I lose my credibility because I liked Fast and the Furious 9 and will probably like the tenth one. In that movie, they outrun a minefield, they swing a car across a canyon on a rope that they didn\u2019t even tie to the car, they put an unsecured car with a rocket strapped to it on the wings of a cargo plane and use the rocket to launch it into space and they stick a super powerful magnet into their car that doesn\u2019t affect their car but does affect everything else on the street. That movie, though, doesn\u2019t demand itself be taken seriously and is a better movie because of it.\n\n\nIf you want me to take your movie seriously, you have to respect that my suspension of disbelief is much lower from the get-go.

            "comment": "I would agree with the general sentiment that some criticism of just about any fiction movie that is grounded only in logic, factuality, rationality can be irrelevant, can miss the big picture being painted by the director, can be completely devoid of sensitivity. I think an even lower form of criticism than pointing out plot holes would be the pointing out of continuity mistakes, small factual exaggerations (this type of gun cannot do such damage, this kind of vehicle doesn't make such sound, etc.) I often enjoy reading those on IMDB, but people who believe these things to be valid negative criticism are either petty, OC or ASD stricken, or completely miss the notion of romancing and creative imagination for the sake of storytelling.\n\nHowever I don't discount poking at plot holes as an entirely bad or irrelevant thing. Some seem trivial and petty to me, such as speculation as what a character would more likely have done, chronological mistakes that do not have an impact on the stakes. But others can be much more substantial. I'd say it depends on the script. A movie like Oliver Stone'sJFK for example better not have glaring plot holes or I'll lose all sense of being emotionally moved by it and will instead go into skeptical critical mode. A story that hinges heavily on conspiracy, or crime, or revenge, or catastrophy will need to have a sturdy enough plotline because believavility-on-its-face is an important element of getting and keeping the viewer invested in the story until the end and more importantly after they're finished watching the movie.\n\nI hope this makes sense, I'm nothing more than a casual giving my two cents.",

You\u2019ve hit on skmething much deeper than just movie reviews. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to answer the question, \u201cwhat is your favorite flavor of ice cream\u201d, but it is much harder, impossible even, to explain why it is your favorite. For your favorite color, it may even be harder still. \n\nWe don\u2019t really know why we enjoy the things we do, but as humans we have the need to make up a reason to fit into the story of ourselves. It\u2019s all post hoc rationalizations. \n\nSo for movies, we have an intuition or \u201cgut\u201d feeling the movie isn\u2019t good or isn\u2019t holding our attention and then we develop the reasons for that lack of interest afterwards. \n\n\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t that people don\u2019t reason. They do reason. But their arguments aim to support their conclusions, not yours. Reason doesn\u2019t work like a judge or teacher, impartially weighing evidence or guiding us to wisdom. It works more like a lawyer or press secretary, justifying our acts and judgments to others\u201d \n\nFrom a review of Jonathan Haidt\u2019s book, The Righteous Mind",

We wave away James Bond license to kill, police back on duty the next day after a shooting and space travel in science fiction movies and so on.  This requires the movies to be internally consistent with both characters and facts. Many plot holes  can be waved away or over looked until they break that \"willing suspension of disbelief\" and then they become movie experience  spoiling.\n  This is basically poor or lazy story telling. The commonest in smart/professional people being dumb to get them to do something to move the plot to the scene they want to show. Then characters do things 180 degrees to how they behaved before for no reason. Then you get to ones where it established the McGuffin can only do X, but later it can now X and Y and Z, to get to the big finish. The most minor ones is \"that wouldn't work/makes no sense\" but that only spoils the movie if it is jarring enough. \n\n Finding a plot hole when you are thinking about the movie later, means that you were in the moment while watching the movie, it may stop you from watching the movie again but if you are thinking about it you got your moneys worth.",

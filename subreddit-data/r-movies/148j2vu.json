Usually it was in the context of a completely nonserious subject. It wasn't until years in my adulthood that I realized that some people, truly, can not handle certain truths. It happens in all facets of life, everywhere. From small things like being unwilling to admit personal faults, or an individual denying established science. But also profound, fundamental things like continuously voting for an utterly detestable orange idiot that actively destroys lives, or the inability to judge their own religious views with the same standards as they judge all other aspects in life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think it will ever stop to amaze me how profoundly skilled humans are in denying that which is right in front of their eyes. Even when faced with the truth, even when being hurt by the untruth, or being actively destroyed by it, many, many people will rather hold on to their hopes and delusions instead of acknowledging said truth. It is truly fascinating.",

    "postText": "I finished the movie and I very much enjoyed reading all the different theories about why he killed his dad and sister, but not mom. A few days after I watched it, I decided to go on IMDb and rate it (I rated it a 9). On IMDb, it said the song of the name where Eva (the mom) walks away from their \u201cjail meeting\u201d in the last scene was called \u201cMother\u2019s Last Words to Her Son \u2026 perhaps indicating that this was their final conversation.\u201d This baffled me actually, and now I\u2019m thinking he killed himself before he was set free. Maybe he was killed in jail. I don\u2019t know. Do you think the song has an underlying meaning? Or it\u2019s a coincidence?",

It's a very old song (that wasn't written for the film) about a mother begging her son to follow Christ and be a good man as he leaves home. \n\nI would say it stands in for all of Eva and Kevin's wishes and failures over the course of the film: her wish for and failure to be a \"natural mother\" to him, his failure to grow into a good human being.",

The main problem I had with the movie is that other than the little girl, there's no one who is likeable in this family, hence their actions are meaningless.  \n\nWere the family members more likeable in the book?  Just curious.",

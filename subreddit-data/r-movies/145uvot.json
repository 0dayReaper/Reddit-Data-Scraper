The endings of Playtest, US Callister and Black Museum really put me in this place. \n\nI\u2019ve just finished watching Devs, and some of the elements from that show almost hit that nerve, especially seeing and hearing the projected history of characters from ancient history. \n\nEthereal movies also go into this for me. Such as Enter the Void. Ad Astra is there too, for the loneliness.\n\nI especially love slow, transcendent movies with crazy scores.",

Avoid spoilers, please. And watch the original Dutch movie.\n\nKairo (dir. Kiyoshi Kurosawa) has scenes of existential dread and horror... a fascinating film. \n\nSuicide Club (dir.

We can use a philosophy to focus or understand these two lenses. Like a set of 3d glasses though, we need both of these tools to compliment each other in order to see with more focus and clarity. Without them(as we were before spirituality and science) the world is fuzzy and imperfect, but it\u2019s still discernible. Using one of these tools can be so useful to focus your understanding of the world around. But you miss out a lot of information (like looking through the blue lens only of a set of these glasses. You have lost the opposing view and fail to see even what they speak about.)And the irony is a lot of people use these lenses to view and judge the use of the other, when as we know about polarisation, they will cancel each other out and seem useless. \n\nOnce you can use science and spirituality as tools to understand our reality around us together and complimentary, this seem a lot clearer, and a whole new picture emerges.  \n\n\nThis is all a metaphor as you understand and sounds crackpot, but it\u2019s how I see them",

The episode where it starts with five mins of it projecting the past is incredible. Going from Neolithic hand paintings, and Jesus.  Joan of arc\u2019s death is a bit brutal, the screams anyway. Then I assume it was the Roman army marching, or Gengis khan\n\nI\u2019ve never seen requiem for a dream, despite knowing the plot",

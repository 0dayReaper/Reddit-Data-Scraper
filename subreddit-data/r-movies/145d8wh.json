    "postText": "I was watching Battle of the five armies and noticed that when the master is hurrying his guards on the escape, he is not actually talking at all, \"C'mon, quickly, quickly\" and his mouth does not move\n\nI have thought that was the case in several movies, where I thought I was crazy, but this time I am certain, and I might be dumb, but I don't get why, I understand in long shots(For example a far away shot of people driving, or something of the sort) but I don't get it in a scenario like this one, when everyone is in close quarters and you can actually see their faces\n\nOther examples(Although those might be because they are old) are some Jackie Chan movies with english speaking people, like Accidental Spy, where there is people that speak english, and the audio is different to what they are saying if you read their lips, and also Some Jean Claude Van Damme movies like \"The quest\"",

What youre talking about is more that they added audio where it wasnt originally meant to be later, likely just to speed things up or fill a moment they didnt want silent.\n\nThey wanted him to say \"C'mon quickly quickly\" but either didnt realize they needed that until they were editing or that originally came in a different spot and they just assumed nobody would really notice enough to care.",

            "comment": "You\u2019re actually talking about a couple of different things. Yes audio is recorded separately, on different equipment than the camera 100% of the time. \n\nBut also a process called Additional Dialogue Replacement is where they re-record the voices of actors saying lines. In the case you described where the guy\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t move, they chose to add those lines later. Keep an eye out for when a character has the back of their head to the camera. That\u2019s an intentional shot they capture so they can add dialogue later if they need to.\n\nAdditionally, most sound  effects (footsteps, doors opening, a drink pouring)",

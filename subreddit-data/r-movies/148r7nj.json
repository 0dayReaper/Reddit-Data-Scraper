    "postText": "I just finished Gunless (2010), a Western about an American gunslinger who shows up in Canada on the run from bounty hunters. Evidently, it TANKED in the Theaters but I think it deserved more appreciation.   \nPaul Gross stars along with Sienna Guillory as the love interest. Even Graham Green has a couple of cameos. I am sure this has everything to do with Paul Gross not being a box office draw, or perhaps because it was Canadian IDK. I mean if Westerns like \"A million ways to die in the West\" can get an audience, then this should have. Does anyone else appreciate it?",

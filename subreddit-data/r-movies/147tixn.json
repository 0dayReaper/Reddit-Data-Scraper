    "postText": "In *Love Simon*, Simon gets a bluetooth speaker for the Christmas season. After he was outed by his friends, he and Blue were humiliated in the cafeteria by two homophobic bullies who had Simon's bluetooth speaker. Then Ms Albright scolds them and when they left, she rudely snatches it saying \"That's mine now! Imma sell it and get my tubes tied!\" and sells it literally!\n\nNow that Simon is upset and had no bluetooth, did he get a new one? And per chance does the confiscated bluetooth belong to one of the bullies (not Simon) and could be another one? I'm confused.",

    "postText": "I don't mean indie level budget, but maybe you were expecting it to be twice as much and yet the movie manages to look in a much higher caliber. \n\nLike Spiderverse 2 having 100million but Elemental using 200 million USD. Or Schlinder's List only costing around 30million dollars. \n\nEvil Dead 2013 cost less than 20million and has some of the best gore effects in horror movie history. \n\nAnd so on, I know maybe the budget sources aren't precise.

The sequels have some of the best ever action scenes, but I love how the first one was simply a story about a retired assassin getting revenge and processing his grief. There were cool hints to a strange underground society that added a little more spice than your average action film. And then the sequels... The action is fantastic, but holy moly have they gotten away from themselves as far as the plot and world building goes.",

It's a little hard to describe, but there's just something about the way the characters interacted that seemed false to me.\n\nI think Nicholas Cage is kind of typecast in my head as Nicholas Cage, if you get my drift. This is really more my problem than anything particular in the film.\n\nI'm just happy people are making Lovecraft movies though. And I had never read Color Out Of Space, so I did, and then that led me down this whole rabbit hole where I went back and rewatched the movie Annihilation, which I appreciated a lot more of this time around, so I read the book for that and I actually learned some cool and interesting things about the way I enjoy movies. I read this book that kind of inspired Lovecraft to begin with called The King In Yellow that I never would have read. And I've read a bunch of stuff that's kind of cosmic horror since then, although I'm back into the Terry Pratchett now, which is about as far away from Cthulhu as you can get.\n\nSorry, I'm going through a lot of changes right now. I started taking THC and it's had an enormous effect on my appreciation of things like art and literature, both of which apply to film.\n\nI did enjoy it though",

I didn't realize how small the budget was until X-Men 1.5 released on DVD with hours of documentary footage in the mid-2000s.\n\nHere's the budget comparison for that year. Not a complete list. Just some I picked from a list of highest grossing:\n\n* $140m - The Perfect Storm\n* $127m - Dinosaur (animation)\n* $125m - Mission: Impossible II\n* $123m - How the Grinch Stole Christmas\n* $110m - The Patriot\n* $103m - Gladiator\n* $100m - Mission to Mars\n* $93m - Charlie's Angels\n* $90m - Gone in 60 Seconds\n* $75m - X-Men\n\nHollywood said no to X-Men because it was a $150m movie on paper, until Bryan Singer convinced Fox he could do it at half the cost. That's, ironically, why we have the MCU today, with budgets that go as high as $365m plus close to the same amount in marketing.",

I mean not for a sci-fi epic these days.\n\nI was definitely expecting it to be more than that, but I guess I forgot that it was essentially a little independent movie for kids. Amazing how it's had such an impact and I'm still enjoying it 45 years later as a grown man as much as I enjoyed it the first time around.",

I know a small number of Star Wars super fans, and they're all about 50 or 55, people who were 5 or 10 when the movie came out. I don't know anybody who's 75 and has a room full of action figures still in the blister packs.\n\nBut it's definitely different from today's children's movies, which pander a lot more. I kind of feel like it's on a spectrum, a line that goes from the bloody plots of Grimm's fairy tales to modern antiseptic soulless Disney condescension.\n\nEdit: grammar",

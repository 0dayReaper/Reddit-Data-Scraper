Or even if you don\u2019t necessarily love the depiction, you don\u2019t feel like the movie suffers too much from it.",

And with that one it wasn\u2019t just the look, it was how they communicated and what their intentions were feeling very alien to how humans operate. Annihilation was the same way.",

Signs is the movie that made me think of the question, it\u2019s one of the most popular alien movies and is semi-recent (last 20 years) and uses a more generic design unironically.",

They come off as genuinely scary and not at all funny in these movies.\n\nCommunion 1989 is pretty good too. Then movies like The Forgotten 2004 and The Fourth Kind 2009 don't really show the aliens, they are more implied to look like the greys, but are very good creepy movies too.",

    "postText": "The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the books (even though it wasn't perfect) and ended up being one of if not the best Trilogy of films of all time.. \n\nThis got me thinking, what other films could have just been swept under the rug and forgotten because the film adaptations were just mediocre to bad?\n\nWhat films could have been remembered as classics if only it had been adapted properly? \n\nRight off the bat, I think something like Captain America Civil War could've been remembered as one of THE BEST action movies of all time, even outside of just the superhero bubble. The comics were just... MMM! The film was by no means bad. Heck, I consider it one of the best MCU films. But the comics I just find to really have that... Idk how to put it, it really does feel like captain america civil WAR. \n\nIT chapter 2 was also kinda butchered. They should've just let the adults be adults if they didn't plan to intertwine the kids storyline. Though tbf, the kids section of the book was always the scarrier one. \n\nAlso, I don't think the Chronicles of Narnia even at its best could ever end up being as big as LotR, but if it was adapted properly (as hard as it may be), it wouldn't have been forgotten.",

I would dissect it here, but you only need to watch the first two minutes to see how beautiful the animation is.\n\nBut no, we don't get animated movies. We get focus-tested Hollywood drek made for bored parents and only the most diehard fans to lap up.",

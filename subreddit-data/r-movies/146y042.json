    "postText": "\"Flash of genius\" (2008) is the windshield wiper movie FYI. I saw it because I like Greg Kinnear and as I recall it wasn't horrible since it dug into the world of patents and the people who get their ideas stolen by big corporations. Anyway, I think the flamin' hot movie is the most pointless subject for a movie ever but again, that doesn't necessarily mean itll be a bad movie. I'm hoping there are some other funny trivial movies I don't know about.",

James Franco's  impression of him was good but he really didn't give much depth to the character other than \"crazy guy who talks funny\". The real Tommy is a fucking nut, he was a complete piece of shit on the set, but you get the sense he really does have a weird connection with Greg that bonds them together. I felt compared to the book the movie was very surface level and wishy washy. Probably also didn't help that Tommy was a producer on the film so he probably wouldn't want any of the book parts that make him look like a psychopath.",

            "comment": "Slightly different direction, but DefunctLand's \"FastPass\" documentary is exactly that, a documentary on the FastPass system at Disney Land/World. It sounds like a super boring premise, but you'll know within the first minute if this is the right movie for you. He manages to take a dry subject like theme park queue maintenance and turn it into a surprisingly curious dive into the mechanics of human psychology and how corporate greed corrupted a goodwill gesture into a money-sucking monster. He uses straightforward metaphors and solid cinematography/filmmaking techniques to artfully describe the raw science behind managing patience. The third-act twist (yes, a twist in a documentary!) blows my mind every time, even when I already know what's coming. It's become a comfort-food film for me, something about the cadence of his voice is very soothing. It's available for free on his YouTube channel!\n\nHe also has a documentary where he discovers who wrote the Disney Channel theme song, while simultaneously pondering whether he qualifies as a true documentarian or just an Internet funny guy. Both are well worth a watch \u270c\ufe0f",

He did independently came up with the idea and his, but what he claims in that \u201c*Frito Lay didn\u2019t realize that Latinos like spicy snack foods*\u201d is NOT true at all. \n\nFrito Lay spends a whole lot of money on market research, even back then. It is widely known that Frito Lay had already fully tested, tweaked, developed and had the manufacturing all set up for a \u201cHot Cheeto\u201d flavor at least 18 months before Montanez presented his very first samples. \n\nFrito Lay was also already targeting the Latino demographic, as their small regional test releases of their \u201cHot Cheeto\u201d were all within the Southwest/Santa Fe market which had a huge Latino community, especially in the early 90s. \n\nThere is hard proof that bags of \u201cHot Cheeto\u201d were manufactured by Frito Lay and on the shelf in small runs within the Southwest market long before the playful story of Montanez taking the \u201cdustless Cheetos\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s never been made clear why Frito-Lay never clarified the story, my hypothesis is that Frito Lay decided to embrace the Montanez\u2019 story rather than confirming it was fiction. I believe it was a marketing strategy to further target the Latino demographic. Frito Lay was then able to market it a snack \u201cfor Latinos, BY Latinos\u201d and c\u2019mon, who doesn\u2019t love a good rags to riches \u201cthe Latino janitor had a million dollar idea and is a VP now\u201d story?",

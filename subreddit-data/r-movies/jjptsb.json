I still think he\u2019s under appreciated. \n\nI got into him watching a bootleg of the Ali-G movie before it was released in the US and A. That\u2019s a scripted movie, but if you watch the interviews he does on British TV as Ali-G which built the character, you can tell he goes into interviews with a plan, but so much is ad libbed or made up on the spot. The interviewee will give opportunity for a joke and he\u2019ll hit it out of the park.  He also tells stories in the interviews, which is probably planned in advance, but he slips those in so well they don\u2019t feel scripted.\n\n[His UK drugs interview is my all-time favorite](https://youtu.be/FBWv55inXfc)\n\nEdit: also in regards to dramas, he\u2019s amazing as the lead in The Spy on Netflix. You forget he\u2019s a comedian after the first episode.",

Pretty sure that was the case when the first movie came out; so many people said their opinion on the film was lessened because, to them, so much was scripted. They couldn't fathom that people actually fell for this shit.\n\nEdit: I'm not saying skepticism isn't warranted, but straight-up refusing to believe that these scenes weren't scripted isn't a very compelling argument that they were.",

They'd just have to establish her figuring it out or being told first. (Assuming they didn't already.)\n\nEdit: Or maybe Superman could have just said it in a way that makes sense. For example, a message that's \\*intentionally\\* cryptic from Batman's pov. Like Superman could accept his fate but say something like \"Please, find Lois Lane and tell her 'Lex Luthor kidnapped  Martha'\". By Superman using \"Martha\" there it would add authenticity the message came from him. Batman could then freak out, assuming this was some code aimed at him, or something. Better yet, his eventual mind changing would make more sense because he was immediately presented with the information in the context of an innocent being captured by a \\*real enemy\\* instead of the whole climax of the movie hinging on \"my mommy had that name too.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLate Edit: Since a few people are defending Superman saying \"save Martha\" I'd like to point out he originally says \"You're letting him kill Martha.\" Leading with \"Save Martha\" might actually make some sense. At least that's a directive TO Batman thus giving \\*slightly\\* more \"permission\" to use his mom's first name, since \"Martha\" is who she would be from Batman's POV. If my dying words were a plea to save my mom I might say her name too. \"My Mom\" can be anyone. \"Stacy Baumgarter\" is in the phone book. The line's wording that kicks off the whole \"why did you say that name?!?!\" routine 99.99999999% of people would say \"my mom\". (It also might be a pronoun game with \"him\" that's a whole other bit of movie stupidity we'll mostly ignore.)",

It humanizes Clark in Bruce's mind. So, the moment goes from a man killing a god to a man killing another man, and thus taking a child from his mother. That would be the last thing Bruce would want to do, considering his backstory. I just feel like the idea wasn't properly executed.",

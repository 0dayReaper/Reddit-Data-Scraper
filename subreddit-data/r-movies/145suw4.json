The whole entire final act of the Sully family and Nemeteya\u2019s GF, vs Stephen Lang was isolated. The sea Navi just disappeared and didn\u2019t help out at all during the Eclipse scene.\n\nAnyone else notice this?",

Everyone is supposedly trying to obtain this eternal youth serum (which is a lot further of a bridge than a superconducting alloy), but they've already got the eternal youth serum because they invented permanent full-mind transfer to not even human bodies.\n\nIf you can grow a $2B Avatar body to put a dead soldier in to fly him across the galaxy to kill another soldiers to get an ounce of whale goo that keeps you alive forever, it seems like cloning your body and doing the mind-transfer thing into a 20 year old version of yourself is a lot more desirable than developing a space whale jizz habit as an 80 year old.\n\nI would have much preferred the Na'Vi to retain the advantage of not needing human bodies as pilots any longer whereas the military still had that limitation.  That also provides in my opinion a more logical path for the Na'Vi to succeed - you might have ships and guns and toys but if we crack your stupid bubbles and get to your meat-bags....\n\nThe whole Avatar part of Avatar is basically dead now.  Nobody is an Avatar anymore except that one scientist guy.",

Nuking it all to extinction would make Pandora just another earth.\n\n2) that's one hell of a good way to get all the Navi United against you\n\n3) as it is now the Navi, who are fractured and fight more amongst themselves then against the humans aren't actually a threat, like at. They're just a small nuisance. \n\n4) the main groups on Pandora are PMCs and Corps, they don't actually have access to nukes(at least not easy access) you would still need authority from some world government(s) and presumably Pandora is under treaties that stop just full scale invasion and destruction.....for now",

Though I've heard that the movie was originally much longer and got cut down, so maybe this is a case of an editing-induced problems where a deleted scene answers that question.\n\nOverall, I thought the movie was super pretty but had a lot of plot issues. Not *holes*, necessarily, but things that don't really make sense and end up feeling like a scene was dropped somewhere.",

Also this one of [passing through the Eye of Eywa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWMErYNAxfI) deserves a mention.",

Conceptually she's really interesting due to being some mind-linking force that stores the Na'vi afterlife and everyone can link to her and them. Really cool concept, not given much focus, but was shown a lot more in the Dream Hunt deleted scene of Avatar 1.\n\nThen there's the Three Laws of Eywa, from the time of the first songs:\n\n1. You shall not set stone upon stone\n2. Neither shall you use the turning wheel\n3. Nor use the metals of the ground\n\nThis indicates the fascinating and unsettling possibility that Eywa might be a biomechanical-AI of sorts, or at least a living entity who's familiar with past technology. That's an utterly fascinating worldbuilding concept.\n\nThe problem is, you're probably thinking \"Wait, I don't remember all that Three Laws of Eywa stuff? When was that in the movies?\" It *wasn't*\u2014it was in the prequel comic.\n\nWhat's the Na'vi culture like? There's a lot of detail on things like their songs and looms... in the Activist's Survival Guide book.\n\nI love Avatar as a franchise, and Cameron clearly has interesting worldbuilding aspects to Pandora, but so far he's left most of it either on the cutting-room floor or in supplementary material.",

The prequel comic, The High Ground, which mentions the Three Laws, was built around the original script for Avatar 2 before Cameron retooled it. And considering Avatar 2 and 3 were originally one film but god too long, I wouldn't be surprised if the Three Laws show up on-screen there.\n2. While of the titles for the sequels the producer confirmed The Way of Water was the only one that stuck, the working title for the final film was The Quest for Eywa, which says to me that even if they don't go with that title Eywa will have more of a focus down the line, which I really hope so because she's my favorite concept at this point (hence Kiri being my favorite).\n\nI think Cameron wanted to show it from early on considering the [Dream Hunt scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tAJFD5fhrE) meant to be in the first film, but for one reason or another he ended up delaying it. Really hope the following films up the ante on more about Eywa though.",

Why is he literally allowed to be the only man left standing? Why did they not say \"hey, the guy who's the whole reason we came out here, let's just check and see what's going on with him\". ????\n\nBut ok, let's just say it's a given that they disappear, why did Neytiri not double team that fool with Jake? He would have been dead in seconds? I'm like, are you serious that not one of them can find a gun or a spear or something with which to shooteth this man?\n\nAnd the ????? moments did not end there. Neytiri is ready to just murder Spider, but then it never gets addressed and theyre all just hanging out again. But then Spider saves the man who was literally trying to murder all of them, and then he just runs back and they're hanging out and it never gets addressed. Like I'm sure they're going to address it in the sequel, but just, ???????.",

But there is more to directing than just pulling off technically challenging shots, or you will get a very impressive CGI fest but an otherwise lacking movie (which is what a lot of people think is Avatar's flaw).

Horrible plot, 2 dimensional characters, and some of the worst dialogue in recent cinema. Strap a terrorist to a chair and have them watch this on repeat instead of waterboarding them and they'll tell you everything you need to know.",

Granted a lot of times my expectations on following through with that are sadly not met (oh how my teen self *mourned* the wasted potential when it came to something like Danny Phantom in the 2000's).\n\nI'm a big fan of concepts that aren't seen enough and I tend to really latch onto them from that alone.

Yet somehow, neither Navi nor other whales believed what he can so clearly show to them. Plus both Navi and the whales find evidence all the time that it's the humans killing whales, exactly like Paykan claimed.\n\nThen again, when Navi see it happening again right in front of them, and Paykan almost alone has to fight, Navi just seem to disappear and do nothing.\n\nYet at the same time, Navi and whales are super good friends and they super trust each other.",

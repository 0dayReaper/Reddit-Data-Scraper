    "postText": "I live in Canada but most my favorite movies are American. And a few are European, Asian, and South American. If I had to pick my favorite Canadian film, though, there would be a few to choose from, but I would probably go with Exotica.\n\nThe movie Exotica is a about a lonely guy (Bruce Greenwood), an auditor, who has lost a child and has not come to terms with that, and meanwhile he is obsessed with a stripper (Mia Kirshner) in a strip club called Exotica. I don't want to say more about it but like its name, it's quite a strange, mysterious, and wonderful movie, quite unlike anything I'd seen before.\n\nFor a movie that is more directly *about* Canada, I would recommend Jesus of Montreal.",

It\u2019s done cheap, has great actors, but also makes a mockery of plastic gangster culture, and explores abuse and trauma (as well as a bunch of other things).\n\nIt manages to take on all those elements and still add humour to the film too.\n\nQuite something, imo.",

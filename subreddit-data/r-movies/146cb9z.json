    "postText": "While there are some films from the early years of the 21st century that look really great, many still had that sort of 90s look and feel to them. Different camera technology, CGI, ways of approaching music, cinematography, costumes, and so on. But in 2014, stuff felt really modern. Interstellar feels super contemporary and as if it was made yesterday. You could argue this was the case already around 2007-2010 for some films. The Dark Knight trilogy comes to mind, and the early Marvel stuff.\n\nHave we reached a point in filmmaking where we've perhaps plateaued or even stagnated a bit recently, in terms of how they look? Are we due for another big leap, or paradigm shift soon?",

This is kind of off topic but if you watch the first episode of breaking bad and then the finale they look like they were filmed in completely different eras of film but they were only like 6 years apart.  Recently the show succession ended and even though its first episode was filmed over 6 years ago, it still looks modern in the same way its finale does.",

It's still way off, but worlds more aesthetically pleasing.

A lot of movies back then were filmed on 35 mm cameras can film stock in its original 4x3 aspect ratio using spherical lenses, but matted to 1.85:1 when presented in theatres. That would immediately introduce a reduction in resolution and a \"flat\" look.\n\nOther movies would go the full 2.35:1 and equivalent widescreen formats, using a mix of film stock and framing. Movies like Escape From New York would use anamorphic lenses to squeeze the entire width of the movie into a single 4x3 frame of 35 mm film. You can tell from the oval-shaped lens flare seen in night shots. Then there's movies like Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Western trilogy filmed in Techniscope where each frame occupied only 2 perforations in height of the typical 35 mm film format, making for an extremely skinny frame on 35 mm film.\n\nDigital filming formats pretty much eliminate these \"inconsistencies\" which gave a lot of pre-digital films their trademark appearances. Today, most movies look the same.",

            "comment": "Probably a few factors. Recency bias will make our eyes used to the color grading trends of the past decade, especially with such a big film as Interstellar. \n\nThe film has large portions of it shot on 65mm IMAX film (I think all the portions where the characters are in space?). Large format film is considerably higher quality than 35mm, and the sharpness and clarity is very noticeable. In the past several years there's been a good number of films that shoot on \"large format\" digital (a sensor similar to 65mm film) such as Joker and Dune. Those films come to mind as recent films that look really \"modern\". Compare that to Batman Begins which was shot on all 35mm. Texture and color grade wise, that film looks like it could be anywhere from 1995 to 2005 (not a bad thing).\n\nInterstellar looks really great too because they shot it as practical as they could. Meaning no green screen. Actors in actual locations or sets, actors seeing projected visuals of space/black holes outside the space craft sets etc. Use of miniatures and physical made models of spacecraft. Something shot with real lighting will always look so much better than computer generated lighting. Think of how 2001 A Space Odyssey still looks fantastic to this day (that film was shot on large format 65mm as well which adds to the \"modern\" feel people might have when seeing it now)\n\nThe art design was incredible on this film too, especially with the CGI visuals of the black hole and the tesseract etc. Really felt like the digital effects team went to great lengths to ensure the audience wasn't taken out of the experience. To your point we might be reaching an era of diminishing returns of CGI advances in film. \n\nIn the end, the movie is made with passion and love from a lot of artists, and Christopher Nolan's ambition. Not many blockbuster films get this perfect alchemy of passion all around and a huge budget to boot.",

No more long dolly shots as it moves around a room. None of that classic Spielberg technique where a person walks into a house, and the camera slowly rotates to 3 perfect framed positions as the person walks from area to area within the house.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me that each shot requires so much work that the end result is that the camera simply doesn't move so much anymore.\n\nI noticed in the last Guardians of the Galaxy movie that some of the early scenes around Knowhere and on some space ships had a *\"camera follows the characters walking into another room\"* style.  And it was really noticeable for me, because it felt like it was breaking the traditional MCU filmmaking style. It almost made it feel like a tv show scene, at times. Like maybe James Gunn was trying to get this movie filmed quicker. I liked it, it made it feel like the areas were lived in.",

None of my children or their friends have a love affair with movies like previous generations. Short form entertainment and gaming rules youth culture. I attest a lot of that to a waning in quality movie making. Funny though, I am not a fan of the look of modern movie magic. To clean. Looks plastic. Dune comes to mind. I am also in agreement with George R. R. Martin about the state of writing, and I find the new class of actors mostly being the children of Hollywood elite or with prestigious schooling jarring. Most of them do not feel familiar, or look like normal people, or have that something, that thing that makes them shine. Anyways. I hope this is not the death of cinema.",

Subtle drop off from mid 2010's, but after COVID its just dropped off a cliff.\n\nI think if you just look at what films used to be popular compared to now explains much of it. Post COVID adult films have basically completely died as a box office spectacle, even something pretty recent like A Star Is Born which grossed 436m in 2018, its unthinkable just 5 years later a film like that could pull in those numbers. Even an  original war film which demands to be seen in the cinema like 1917 in 2019, pulled in 384m which wasn't incredible but its very difficult to see a film like that doing that well nowadays.\n\nThe consequence of course is the high budget, mid budget adult market is going extinct, of course lower budget adult fare still gets made, and occasionally a streamer mind fund some high end ideas in the hope of award recognition but nothing like the level of previous.",

The original shows were hardly high art, but they definitely had style, nuance, and maybe even a little heart.  The recent movies may as well have been written by chatGPT compared to the originals. \n\nThe only examples I can think of getting it somewhat right might be the Star Trek reboots. They have their issues, but they seem to be honest attempts to bring modern film tech to the space while remaining faithful to what gave the original its charm.  The newer Star Wars films on the other hand\u2026they\u2019ve had 3 to 6 strike outs. \n\nThe good original films these days seem to be off beat, smaller productions.  Wes Anderson, whether you like his work or not, you have to give him credit for doing something different than everyone else, and not relying on bigger and brighter flashing lights. Apple TV+ seems to bring a gem here or there, like CODA, for example.  \n\nIt seems like the best efforts are going toward longer series pioneered by HBO and shows like the Sopranos or the Wire. The modern examples these days might be Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul.  Game of Thrones might be an example that lost its way a bit, but largely a strong overall production.  Netflix seems to live off the hope that every new show is one of these while remaining ready to throw in the towel at any sign of trouble.  Ozark was pretty good, and thankfully not stretched too far beyond what it really should have been.  I would guess this format fits the home viewing model better while allowing for more mileage to wrung from the expenses related to production than a 2 hour film yields.",

New generation isn't as good  etc - like I was reading *Easy Riders and Raging Bulls* about how the great 70s movies were made (interesting book), and the author spends the first bit railing against the terrible corporate state of modern movies in the 1990s. Tarantino rages against the 80s as being shite, flattened kids films that led to cinema's ruin. The 50s were bad because of the Hays code repressing cinema, even though we got stuff like Singing in the Rain from it. \n\nAlso I think in regards to your second point - movies haven't been the main thing 'the youth' give a shit about since the 50s when TV ate movies' lunch and became the new dominant medium that defines culture. Nowadays with video games, and more importantly the several different supermassive mediums (social media/youtube) within the internet ecosystem, society has likewise moved on from TV. And that's been good for it - no longer being the big thing has led to better TV as a whole since the 2000s; serialised arcs rather than episodic TV, taking far more influence from films and getting real weird with it, like the 70s did with cinema. \n\nAll this being said, there is absolutely a hyper-corporate homogenising problem with the state of film right now - although you can still use that to prove it's still super popular. I think the obsessive MCU fandom sweeping up average people into it (at least until Endgame) shows that the medium is still huge, although now the idea of being a 'film fan' is wrapped up in franchises and the online second life of film and fandom is unfortunately completely co-opted by these megacorps. I think we're overdue some sort of big late-60s-style revamp of cinema but it's still going strong.",

It\u2019s subtle, but it allows us to comfortably integrate with the viewing experience. As film technology advanced dramatically in the 2010\u2019s, visual fidelity too closely approached reality and our brains began to have a more difficult time engaging with films. This is best approximated to the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d theory where artificially-rendered humans that are very close to life-like but are not quite perfect generate a palpable discomfort (see *The Polar Express*).

And I think for audiences a bit of the wow-factor is lost when everything is assumed to be vfx.\n\n\nIf one person can just feed an AI a prompt and generate a movie (and then feed the AI notes to tweak it) you might end up with a cool story, but I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d end up with a cool movie.\n\n\nWorst case, a single person could put all their worst ideas into their movie without any filter. Filmmaking is collaborative, and something is definitely lost if you remove that. If Ridley Scott had made Blade Runner by himself using a bunch of AI tools, you wouldn\u2019t have that awesome improvised \u201ctears in rain\u201d speech at the end. If Seinfeld was just Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David making the show by themselves using AI tools, you wouldn\u2019t have Bryon Cranston\u2019s dentist huffing the laughing gas, because some random crew member wouldn\u2019t be there to say \u201cit\u2019s be funny if\u2026\u201d\n\n\nEdit:\n\nOn a slightly more selfish/personal note, AI tools \u201cdemocratizing\u201d film would likely put people like me out of a job. Perhaps I\u2019m cynical, but I feel like the biggest beneficiaries of these AI tools (especially in the near term) will be the studios, since it would empower executive meddling and allow studios to cut costs by eliminating a bunch of jobs (and those jobs are how people come up in the industry and learn the craft). Eliminate enough of those jobs and filmmaking becomes much *less* accessible. No matter what, distribution costs money (streaming infrastructure ain\u2019t free). If the studio head\u2019s nephew can make a movie on their laptop by themself, how is a random nobody going to break into the industry? Right now, the path in for unconnected people is to start at the bottom of the crew hierarchy and work hard/have talent.",

But before that era, looking back, it feels like movies looked a little different from today.\n\nLooking back further, movies of the 90s had a very distinct 90s look. Thinking of all the action flicks and disaster movies for example. Same with the 80s and 70s, etc. \n\nBut I really can't see a major difference between around 2008 and today, at least not for the big budget films.",

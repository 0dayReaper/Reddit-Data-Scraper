What one-off movies trigger the same sense of fascination for you?\n\nPersonally, *Prisoners*, *The Prestige* and *Office Space* are three movies that I can never get enough discussion/analysis/theorizing about. I'll take any scrap of info that I can get about them. Whenever a reddit post about them pops up, I always try to find something to contribute.",

Part of me wants them to explore more about this world where dream sharing technology exist and used in variety of ways. But part of me also wants it to just be a standalone movie and pondering the wider implication of such world is part of the fun of the movie.",

Doesn't mean you can't have great/all-time/never-exhaust franchise movies. Of course you can, and we do (Godfather 1 and 2, for example). But it's harder, not easier. \n\n[There's an (inadvertently) hilarious line about this idea and the MCU in the New Yorker this week:](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/12/how-the-marvel-cinematic-universe-swallowed-hollywood)\n\n&gt; directors\u2014Patty Jenkins, Edgar Wright\u2014have quit Marvel projects, after battling for creative control. \u201cThe only times we\u2019d run into problems is if we got a filmmaker who said, \u2018This is what I want to do,\u2019 and then showed up and wanted to do something completely different,\u201d a former Marvel executive told me. \u201cSo then you hear people saying, \u2018Kevin Feige came in, and he took over the process!\u2019 But, if you know what the game plan is, you end up having a ton of creative freedom at Marvel, because we\u2019re working inside the box.\u201d Scorsese would shudder.\n\nBut, although the executive is inadvertently hilarious, they're not wrong. The franchise, tv-like nature of the thing *does* require a degree of inside-the-box filmmaking and thinking. But that does mean significantly more finite filmmaking and films.",

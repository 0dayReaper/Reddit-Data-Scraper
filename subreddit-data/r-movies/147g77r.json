    "postText": "So I've watched both movies multiple times, but I'll admit this is something I'm still not 100% certain on or understand.\n\nPut simply: What set Vito and Micheal on such different paths in how they run the family or how they act? They both suffered painful losses, they're both willing to kill and order people to kill for the good of the family. Yet Vito in the end came off dignified, caring loved and died in happiness with family. Whereas Micheal was bitter, more violent, hateful and ultimately died alone.\n\nSo what was it that set them apart so much? Why were they so different despite going through/doing so many similar things?",

                    "comment": "That was kind of my thoughts as well. Vito built up his family with hard work and by connecting with and helping people. Michael was born into a family where most of the work was already done - and he rose to the top of it by killing Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, which may have showed him that force and killing people is how you get what you want in the world.\n\nVito says in the opening scene of 1, \"... we're not murderers, despite what this undertaker says.\" He believes in justice. Mike's first act in the underworld was something completely contrary to what his father believed, which again, helped him get to the head of the family.",

He is pissed that Bonasrra wants nothing to do with him, but comes to ask him to murder the men who beat and tried to rape his daughter.  But Vito excepts his apology and agrees to give his daughter justice.\n\nVito doesn't bully people.  He approaches the landlord (GF II) and asked him to do him a favor.  He doesn't threaten him when he says no.  He tells him to ask around.  The landlord comes back and is apologetic, reduces the rent and lets her keep her dog.  That the end of it.\n\n\nHe offered Johnny Fontaine's bandleader lots of money, 10k, to release him.  When he said no, he threatened to blow his brains out.\n\nSame with Jack Woltz.\n\nHe was very nice to Sollozzo.  Told him no, wished him well, didn't stop him but didn't help.\n\nYeah, he killed Fanucci and Ciccio, but they deserved it.\n\n\nMichael has no conscience and is brutal.    He wants to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey.  He kills all the family heads.  Moe, Carlo and Tessio.  These murders are probably justified, but not Fredo.  Fredo was stupid and jealous and taken advantage of, but he was his brother.",

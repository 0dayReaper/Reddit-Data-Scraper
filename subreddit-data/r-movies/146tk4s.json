    "postText": "The sci-fi horror survival movie breathes a new life into a dying franchise, while at the same time manages to be the best installment in the series.\n\nI loved the characterization of the protagonist. She is observant and badass at the same time. You would genuinely find yourselves rooting for the lead character. Her observant nature does come to play at the climax of the film in a pleasing way. It was a breath of fresh air to see a protagonist be so resourceful and smart.\n\nThe flick also does a great job of painting The Predator as an intimidating villain and a force to be reckoned with. As the movie progresses, you begin to wonder how our protagonist would overcome her adversary, because they do a such a great of building it up as threat.\n\nComing to the politics of the film, they were some people complaining about the film being 'woke', but it doesn't come off like that in any way. Yes, the movie had a female protagonist and had some characters giving sexist jibes to the protagonist, but it wasn't too 'on the nose' or 'preachy' as the detractors were making it sound like. It seems as if they have a problem with every non-white or female protagonist.\n\nI do feel that movie takes too long to come to its point, and some scenes felt drawn out. There were times when I felt that the movie was going too slow, and wanted to jump to the main action. But it is a minutr problem in a very enjoyable flick.",

Dutch only won in the end because he had time to observe the Predator. Arguably, the Predator could see he was leader of the team and wanted to save him for last, but this also gave Dutch valuable time to deduce its tactics, motivations and weaknesses, which enabled him to bait and kill the Predator.\n\nPrey works the same way from the opposite end and is consistent with Predator lore. The Predator doesn't target Naru because they don't target women that aren't direct threats. It didn't attack Anna in 1, it didn't kill Leona when he caught her off-guard and it didn't kill the woman having the over-the-top, mind-blowing 1990s sex in the penthouse in 2. However, it did kill the armed women that opened fire on the train in 2 and it did attempt to kill Isabelle in Predators.\n\nSo it literally makes sense that the Predator in Prey wouldn't attack Naru until she made herself a direct threat. This gave her - like Dutch - time to observe the Predator's behaviour and motivations, and she gathered enough detail to bait the Predator into a trap.",

They wouldn't need a couple thousand calories to replenish, nor need any recovery time.\n\nNot to mention, the first film also glosses over how Dutch builds the final trap with a large, cleanly cut log. He only had a knife, so how did he cut it (because it wasn't a natural cut in the wood). And how did the little twig at the end of the rope hold the weight of that log? Physics need not apply.\n\nPoint is, a lot of the original film is actually pretty ridiculous if you scrutinize it for just a second. It's just whether or not you're willing to accept it.\n\n&gt;I'm not even getting into the magic herbs and physics-defying axe on a string.\n\nIt's actually consistent with the suspension of disbelief. Mud would only camouflage Dutch's heat for a few minutes, until his body warmed the mud up to his temperature. It works for the initial scene where he gets covered because it's brief, but not for the final showdown. Likewise, the flower is suspension of disbelief. Actually reducing your body temperature more than a few degrees could kill you, but there are herbs that can apparently slow bleeding and cool you down. The movie exaggerates the effect for the story to work, just like the first film.",

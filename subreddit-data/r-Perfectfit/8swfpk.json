Fucking bizarre. I might have to go down and take a picture of it. It's definitely a long-bore artillery of some kind, no engine, has sighting pins housed at the top covered in a protective tin casing that can be freely removed, etc.\n\nEither way, someone had found that a coke can perfectly fit in the breech and rammed that shit in there. So now there's just this perfect round bottom of a soda can stuck in there.\n\nNow I'm on a quest to find a 2.6 inch diameter artillery and figure out wtf we have sitting at the local park...\n\n*edit* After sliding on up to the park and having a look, it's a 40mm bofers mk2 anti-aircraft gun mounted on a four-wheeled body designed to be towed around. So yeah, a coke can (at least one two decades or so ago) perfectly fits in the breach of an old ww2 40mm anti-aircraft gun.",

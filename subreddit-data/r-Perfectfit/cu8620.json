At night time our boat would reach a dock and we'd park there for the night but in the morning we'd wake up to see that there were one or two other boats nestled against us.  So instead of lining up on the limited shoreline, they were placed together 2 or 3-deep.  \n\nThis was done so well that no one ever felt anything as they slept when they joined due to the bumpers in place.  You'd just wake up and open your window and bam, you'd see the hull of another ship right there.  \n\nAll these ships were by the same company (Viking) so the middle lobby areas were actually all joined with a tiny ramp.   So the parties on the furthest boat would have to walk through the other two to get to the shore dock.  \n\nIt was pretty cool and pretty interesting.\n\nWe went down the Danube River so we got to see a ton of these canal gates in action.  They even have cameras on the ships so you can sit in your room and watch the water rise and drop and the canal gates open and close.",

The ship is not huge so it's rather intimate.  Each day was great.  The locations were great.  The guides and tours were great and extremely informative.  The food was great.  And the crew was absolutely spectacular.  \n\nIt was our first river cruise.  We did one ocean one before when I was a child, and that is kinda what you expect.  Ocean cruise versions are just about moving as little as possible and eating as much as possible, and looking at endless ocean (I hear the Alaska one with the glaciers is really something though).  \n\nThe river cruise blows ocean cruises out of the water if you actually want to learn things on your trip.  The Danube River is amazing and there's so much history and beauty to it and the regions that it feeds.",

There are days when there is appeal to having a regular salary, but at this point the freedom that comes with being external is too strong for me. The rest of my immediate family all works for themselves in one degree or another, and so I had that desire for a long time before starting this. The business skills are where I see technical people trip up, as being great at IT does not make you great at running a company. This is frequently seen in promoting great technical people into terrible managers. If you want to get a taste of it, find some business 101 classes to see if you like it. I actually do have a business undergrad degree, and several of my classes were extremely beneficial to getting this thing started. Like my Entrepreneurial Finance class. Where we spent an entire semester talking about how to start a company :-)",

I have had an underlying desire to work for myself for a long time, and this May will be 7 years owning the company. For people with a strong technical background, I see the biggest mistakes happening in sales and business decisions, such as how to market, how to network, how much to charge, how to not under charge, how to get paid (this is huge), how to hire people and expand, etc. Having the drive to make it work is a must, and you certainly need capital to get started even with something as low overhead as IT consulting. I have seen a number of competitors decide they were good at fixing computers or setting networks only to crash and burn on all the rest of the aspects of running the business. Not to say I have it all figured out, but I am happy to have had this amount of success for this long.",

Works just the same and no untested hardware issues.\n\nAnd the phone is my main music player. \n\nI want to use my tech, not service it. So I built redundency at every area, while also making each component easy to replace or sell. \n\nI find powerful rigs mesmerizing, but its too much of an invesment in one system, that can break down at any point.  makes me anxious.

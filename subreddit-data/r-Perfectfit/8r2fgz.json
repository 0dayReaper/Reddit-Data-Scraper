Any and all civilian boats are to be turned around at the checkpoint 2km before 39XX, and given health and safety code restrictions as a reason for the blockade. D-Class personnel are to be sent into 39XX twice weekly. \n \n**Description:** SCP-39XX is a stone bridge measuring 3m in length and 1.5m in height, with a 1m gap between the water and bottom of the bridge. Any and all humanoid entities that traverse below the bridge are transported to a pocket dimension (hereby referred to as SCP-39XX-1a.) Multiple armed exploration teams have been sent into the SCP-39XX-1a but none have returned. Containment Procedures are to focus on limiting civilian access to the bottom of the bridge and spreading false rumors about loose bricks and stray rebar causing health risks to those who travel under it.

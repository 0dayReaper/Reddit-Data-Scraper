Use a razor blade (GENTLY) on a wet window to remove stuff that won\u2019t come off with the applicator, squeegee, polish/detail/clean-up routine or your fingernail. Don\u2019t use Windex. It tends to streak bad. Either make your own with dish soap, vinegar, and water or buy good soap from a specialist retailer (that\u2019s what the professionals use).",

I will try to explain my lack of enthusiasm for this kind of thing. \n\nFirst thing to note is that companies don't always produce their own packaging, and often hire a 3rd party to provide the boxes etc. So even when the product is different, the packaging is often the same but with a different finish or \"skin\". The most obvious example might be soda-cans. They are all 33cl and havs the exact same shape, even if one brand is pepsi and the other coca-cola. The companies may have asked for a slightly different lid or something, but overall it's the same packaging. \n\nIn your case, it seems quite obvious to me that in reality the boxes don't perfectly fit, but are in fact the same size with a slightly bendy material. I might be wrong, but to me it looks that way. If you still have the boxes, you can perhaps test this hypothesis by switching wich one is inside the other and see if you get the same effect. \n\nSo my postulate isn't that they purposely try to fit their competitors, but that both companies use the same 3rd party packaging company. So when i said \"made to fit\", it wasn't meant as completely purposely, but more that they happen to fit for obvious reasons. \n\nAs i mention in my first comment, i've seen way too many \"cupholders holding cups\", which to me just isn't surprising or satisfying to watch. Like fitting dishes in a dishwasher.\n\nI hope i'm making sense.\nI realize it's really not a big deal and i should have probably just scrolled past it. But now i've written all this explanation, so i guess it's way too late \ud83d\udca9.\n\nEdit: a bit of grammar and clarity.",

However, in this particular case, I can reassure you that what you perceived was not the case.\n\nThese boxes are made from a particularly hard type of cardboard, if they were the same size, the base of the one would have ripped the the top of the other.\n\nThis is also evident in someone else's comment where they mentioned that they have done this with multiple boxes inside each other, and these boxes are definitely not that stretchy.",

The plate is actually a little wider than the rim of the lid, but because of the angle of the cross section, it can bend the lid slightly and pop in, like a zip tie. They probably had to push the plate a bit to get it to fit.\n\nNo amount of pressure would do it, since it won't seal perfectly. They just have to shake it hard enough and hope nothing breaks.",

It\u2019s not the same as using sz tho. \u00df is a legit letter you cannot exchange for ss whenever you like. \u00df only gets turned into ss when it\u2019s part of a name and you want to write it in capital letters, since there wasn\u2019t a capital form of \u00df before. This is probably confusing for non-German speakers lol",

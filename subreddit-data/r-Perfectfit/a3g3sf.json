Every other branch on that tree still has it's terminal bud except for the one that OP is concentrating on. \n\nSome trees like white pines don't quite have the conical shape like this fir does. So perhaps that's what you're talking about. Spruce and firs always look like christmas trees without pruning. If you remove the terminal bud, axillary buds will activate and you'll typically have 2 branches coming out of that spot. Perhaps that's something done to make them look fuller. \n\nWhat I *do* know is that someone just cut the top of that fir tree. It's a really weird thing for the seller to do .",

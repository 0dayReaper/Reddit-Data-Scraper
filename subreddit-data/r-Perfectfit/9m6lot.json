Here's the worst case scenario I have, with respect to weight:\n\n[Bookshelf Closeup](https://imgur.com/a/qnrmyKD) (Note that the camera lens distorts straight lines, so ignore that top shelf).\n\nThose are large-format bibliography reference books. The Reginald on the right (Science-Fiction / Fantasy Literature 1975-1991) weighs 6 pounds by itself. So total weight on that shelf is roughly 60 pounds. If you run a straight edge from one corner to the other, the bow on that shelf is 1/4 inch. If you have a lot of heavy books, and get super irritated with bow, then perhaps a hardwood would be better for you.\n\nThat said, pine boards also bow, just not as much. The particle board shelf has a completely smooth surface, so there is a lot less wear and tear along the bottom of the book than with a hardwood (if you move the books alot, as with reference books).\n\nI have a few hundred SF magazines in boxes that I intend to shelf in my new house, and I will probably build shelves for those, but mostly because most of them are digest size (like traditional paperbacks) and the shelf spacing on the Billys are less than optimal for paperbacks (although you might be able to fit an extra shelf in both the top and bottom sections).\n\nSo I'm happy with the Billys. I can easily move them to another room if I want, and was able to take them apart and put them back together on the last house move. I'm surprised at the durability for particleboard.",

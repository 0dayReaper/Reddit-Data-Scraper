Rapid depreciation and what not. I don\u2019t mind taking partial blame for each vehicle but previous owners were the largest factor. Then again most people I know drive used cars and have almost no issue so I consider myself fairly cursed. \ud83d\ude0e\n\nMotorcycles are pretty amazing for the right people. There\u2019s something be said about getting super car performance from a sub $10k bike that has the reliability of a 90\u2019s Corolla. But it takes a certain individual to accept and mitigate the risk to reward of being on two wheels.",

I agree that depreciation sucks, though. I also drive a used car. As of right now, zero key issues. Only very minor stuff.  \n\n\nExactly. I wasn't going for performance, though: I wanted fuel economy and cheap zero mileage transport coupled with fun cornering. I was looking at 125cc bikes, but the cost of gear (helmet, jacket, etc.) and cold Winters made me change my mind.",

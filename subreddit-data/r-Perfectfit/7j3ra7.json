It\u2019s about fitting and being able to operate the vehicle. \n\nThat said I fit in quite a lot. Some better than others. Hondas are right out, as are Nissans. I can\u2019t physically get in them and shut the door. \n\nI can get in a Miata, but the pedals are already mashed to the floor when my ass is pressed in to the seat. But my wife drives a 6 and I can drive it fine as well.  Strangely enough I can drive a bmw z3 with the top down just fine. Fun little car. Feels like a gocart with my head sticking up over the windshield. \n\nI can also drive a mini just fine. I drove a \u201869 911 for a while in the 80s. But I can\u2019t get my legs under the dash of the newer ones. \n\nI currently drive a full size Dodge Ram. Lots of headroom. I could wear a cowboy hat if I wanted. But, I\u2019ll never be able to heel-toe a corner competitively. Not enough room to get my legs straight enough to rotate my leg that way. \n\nSuch is life. Cars and planes are the only things that make me wish I was shorter. Aside from that it\u2019s great. ",

It's not unusual at all here to ask for a slice of lime with your coke, but it has to be asked for.\nA very popular drink in the summer here is the \"Perrier tranche\" : tranche stands for slice, so it's basically fizzy water with lemon in it. These are, to my knowledge, the only two non-alcoholic drinks that are served with lemon slices.\n\nEdit: I might have used the trick of getting the slice \"stuck\" with coke on top waaaaay too many times.

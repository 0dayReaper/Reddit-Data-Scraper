In *fact*, the rotation of the door about the hinges causes an event-horizon-esq effect upon its outermost surface. As we all know, the event horizon is the point at which the spaghettification phenomenon irreversibly begins. Here, this causes all matter in the relative vicinity of the edge of the door to be drawn towards the door at exponential, however temporary, accelerations. *This* causes the collisions, as the edge of the dishwasher and handle of the oven are stretched towards and consumed by the man made space/time warp that is produced. This can only be prevented by the aforementioned, standard r/perfectfit protocol: perform all actions in videos/gifs in a manner which incites suspense and anxiety upon the viewer of said video/gif. This is no mere recommendation. No, but a warning against some unsuspecting redditor who might incidentally spawn black hole into his/her very home just for the up-doots.",

The effects of it are only observable when from a rotational frame of reference. \n\nHowever Reactive Centrifugal Force is a real force, it\u2019s an actual Newtonian Force that is observable in all frames of reference. \n\nSo technically when in rotation the Centrifugal Force and the Reactive Centrifugal Force are equal. And depending on the frame of reference in our observation of the door the Centrifugal Reaction Force could actually be the force causing this. \n\nThe reactive force would be on the constraint or the hinges keeping the door in an arced path and the door frame that the hinges are attached to would be feeling the effects of the reaction force to the centripetal Force. \n\nBasically frame of reference and whether or not the door is actually moving at the time of observation can make those two terms interchangeable. \n\nHowever, in this instance the actual force causing this is the Reactive Centrifugal Force since the hinges have more room to move. \n\nThe Centrifugal Force is working on the actual door, at different magnitudes depending on the coordinates on the door. The door is also much more solid and therefore doesn\u2019t \u201cstretch\u201d due to this force like the hinges allow. ",

I covered the rest, bought her the games, and got the Nintendo online jazz.\n\nThose 1st party Nintendo Switch games do not seem to lower in price!  She finished the Pok\u00e9mon game I got her and is playing Mario Odyssey. We also have Mario Kart and Bravely Default II.  Not really sure what to get us other than the 2 Zelda games after those.",

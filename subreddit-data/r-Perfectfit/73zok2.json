For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies, and are more than just ice king on the cake. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite.\n&gt; So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality.\n&gt;I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go.\n&gt;Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the fax, instead of making a half-harded effort. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it's a peach of cake.",

It's how people learn new languages. natives and some newer foreigner institutions first teach english verbally instead of by writing. verbal learning enforces a flow of the language instead of the semantics and grammar, which allows rapid integration into native communities at the cost of introducing these types of errors. \n\nMost of the traditional (quality) foreign primary schools (and private english speaking schools) teach english via rule-based approach with the goal of passing some test. So most non-native speakers should find this error immediately.",

The play could have continued if he pulled it out immediately and put it on the ice at his feet, but he was surprised and that probably didn't come to mind. It's bad for the player cause he just took a puck to the face, but it couldn't be penalized in any way cause no one got the puck stuck intentionally. Would just be a face off.",

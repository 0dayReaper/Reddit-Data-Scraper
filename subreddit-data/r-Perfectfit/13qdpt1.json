Huh, how?  So I googled it.\n\nI grabbed my pot, got the water to boil, placed the Colander down, and the freaking pot lid fits perfectly on top. It creates a little steam compartment, allowing it to steam any veges placed on the side. We have frequent power cuts here, so any time we need cooked, I steam it. (We have a gas stove)",

                                    "comment": "Thanks for posting that article. As a current amazon employee i would like to clarify a few things. First I have and do pack shipments. This automation the article speaks of only works currently with single item purchases or shipments. Which isnt much of Amazon's business as many people tend to buy multiple items at once. Now when you have to pack multiple items the algorithm that decides which box to use for the items needing to be packed isnt ideal and has some issues. To understand this better each individual item at amazon is scanned for weight and size dimensions to identify the correct box to be used. Sometimes it's rather off and we have to decide which box to use for the shipment. I cant tell you how many times the system has told me to use a box thats 3 times too small. On top of that, sometimes an item is whats called a \"masterpack\" which has multiple items in the box straight from the business or manufacture.  With the masterworks sometimes a new person wont recognise it amd send the entire box in the order. Every once in awhile you could order one item, but recive 12. Thats why once the items are packed and sent down the conveyor they are scanned amd xrayed and weighed to make sure. Once in awhile during heavy volume it doesnt get caught and you get more. Now on top of all that, I cant tell you how many times a day something breaks down or gets jammed. And we have to stop. Amazon wants us to continually keep working in a fashion that's purely robotic, then they gwt upset at you if your body decides its had enough physical labor, when they dont understand that even machines running 24\\7 cant keep up with the demands of customers, but we're supposed too... So reading this article and knowing what i know. This currently is only in a testing phase. They do not plan to replace us anytime remotely soon because we can interpret orders better then a machine can at this point. Once the AI gets to our ability to problem solve then this level of automation will be implemented nation wide. I went on a ramble so if you have any more questions just ask. Im not pro or anti amazon. Just need to pay my bills and figured id give ya some insider knowledge.",

With Domino's, the theory is they're collecting the data of 'quality of pizza' so that they can use the cameras in store to flag a pizza as 'not quality' before it enters the oven, or leaves the store. It's all definitely possible, and so is a mostly automated shipping warehouse.",

I'd imagine most of the issues Amazon encounters fall in to one of three categories:\n\n1. bad data (sizes of product are wrong, or for an old packaging version, or multiple packaging versions exist)\n2. non-rectangular items (especially flexible things like clothing that take up a different area profile depending on how they're folded). You can let your algorithm assume a bounding rectangular prism for a cylinder, but two shirts and a pair of jeans could be shaped slightly differently each time.\n3. Inability of a robot to manipulate objects the same way people do - I can make a shirt fit into a box by folding it in half, or tucking it between two other items in the box. Getting a robot to do that, and do it efficiently is a lot easier said than done.",

With a wide variety of SKUs it becomes very difficult to automate the packing and, in certain industries, picking of orders.  I work in automotive warehousing and there's no way even with the small parts we could automate.  \n\nCould you imagine a robot picking screws, seals, dipsticks, loctite, and a valve assembly?  Packing would be even worse because of heavy items and fragile items being shipped together.  Short of a dispenser tailored to each item it isn't technologically or financially feasible right now.",

A computer could easily try a million ways of packing 5 items to see what fits best.\n\nWhat I do suspect is an issue though is the physical robots and making software to control them. If 5 items have to be packed in specific orientations to each other to pack the most efficiently, they need both a robot that can grab and manipulate products like a human, and the software to control that complexity.",

I know some facilities are upgraded regularly while others can get left in the dust sometimes but this seems like they aren\u2019t even trying to make this work..\n\nSomeone mentioned your job being in jeopardy but if the packing instructions are so bad robots are not yet their best options and they have a ways to go.. once they try to figure it out I\u2019m thinking the simple boxed products might be packed by robots but they\u2019ll still need help with oddball items and should you not be lowest man on the totem you should be reasonably okay for awhile at least..",

Their parent company, Glanbia is a very smart company out of Ireland.\n\nIt's very likely that they have worked with Amazon logistics to minimize the costs of shipping this, as margins on protein powder are very slim. Taking a few cm out of the dimensions of a box will save a ton of money over time with the volumes of 2 and 5lb protein powder.  \n\nThere's likely a particular code for the box to pull when this order gets placed in the Amazon distribution centers that is allocated particularly for these ASIN#'s. \n\nThe company is also working with Amazon to transition all protein powders to bags, since they are more efficient than these plastic tubs.\n\nKeep getting those gains bro \ud83d\udcaa",

As someone who has spent a decade in the space, when you are that big on Amazon, you often work with Amazon to make packaging that can be shipped directly to the consumer without repacking. It is called Ships in Own Container or SIOC. Whey might have been building Ecom friendly products that are either SIOC, or designed to fit one of their boxes perfectly. I believe Amazon only carries about 6-10 box sizes overall.",

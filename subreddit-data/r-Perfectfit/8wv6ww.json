It's so easy to just look around and get amazed by how beautiful nature is. There are a few downsides tho. The first one is Amazon. I can't even tell you how many times I wanted to order an item just to find out it doesn't ship to Switzerland. You're basically stuck to ordering things from Switzerland, which tends to be a bit more expensive even after shipping compared to Amazon (I don't mind tho as wages are quite high compared to quite a lot of countries). Secondly it's pretty tiny. That might sound cool as everything is near you, but it also means that you might have seen a lot of it pretty quickly. One upside I can definitely give is that because wages are high compared to a lot of other European countries, going abroad doesn't cost too much. \nEdit : wages, not loans.",

For example, if we examine a person's DNA we can determine the odds that their ancestors lived in a certain region of the world. As such, \"the odds were 100%, we just didn't know it\" is an impossible statement, because the odds describe our knowledge of the event by definition, therefore the only way to know an event's odds are 100% is to know all relevant information.\n\n*braces for onslaught of further contrarian banter and jokes involving dicks and throats*",

That's why i asked.\n\nAmericans tend to adopt some german words into their language, for stuff where they don't have a single word to describe something (like Schadenfreunde, Wanderlust, Wunderkind, Zeitgeist...stuff like that). \"Preiswert\" means more than just inexpensive. It's more like \"good value for the money\". I don't think there's a analogous word in the english language, so it could be possible that they started to use preiswert to describe something like that.\n\nedit: [here's](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_deutscher_W%C3%B6rter_im_Englischen) a list of german words used in the english language. preiswert isn't on there, but it could be something new.",

Sorry for your karma being abused by morons. I changed it from -1 to 0  :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Suspecting how this is done (motion tracking with After Effects and manipulation in Photoshop), I went through it frame by frame and saw obvious, sloppy manipulation especially:\n\n\u2022 when the bottle is crossing the street, black lines appear on the street where there were none.       \n\u2022 when the bottle crosses over the skateboard, the back wheel disappears before the bottle covers it up.      \n\u2022 [and MOSTLY revealing is when it\u2019s crossing the lines surrounding the hole, one line disappears momentarily.](https://imgur.com/a/XmY11Tn)  A clear sign someone\u2019s hand, perhaps, or a tool was erased in post production and \u201cHey, it looks good enough,\u201c so the line wasn\u2019t drawn back in by hand.     \n\u2022 the hole also does an odd disappearance then reappearance as the bottle\u2019s narrow section is entering the hole. Let\u2019s not even guess why **there\u2019s not even a hint of a shadow** from the bottle even tho the skateboard casts one!      \n\u2022 speaking of those holes, don\u2019t they look so oddly well-defined and out of place compared to the rest of the fuzzy image?     \n\u2022 overall lighting seems to change while the bottle is in flight like it was filmed twice and the cloud cover changed a bit between shots. \n\nThere\u2019s probably more things a professional could point out, especially in the original video, wherever that is. \n\nCheers!",

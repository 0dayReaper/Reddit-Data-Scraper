We had a lighted screen on the opposite side to create contrast when the photo snapped.    \n  \nWith the outline we were able to do a simple binary quantization after using Canny edge method.  Then using some concave filling we basically created a black and white picture of the bottle for the computer.    \n  \nThe bottle *picture* was sliced in half vertically and rotated so the flat side was down (to remove things like handles, etc).  We used a radial integration on the resulting line that represented the active edge of the container.  This would give us a unit volume, which was easy to translate to something like ounces by knowing how far the camera was from the bottle.  \n  \nOur user interface (developed in LabVIEW, code written in MATLAB) had you select the material of the bottle, so you could do glass, ceramic, plastic, etc.  There were a few other options that the user input to give really accurate results.  Then a gravity operated reservoir dropped water in.  I wanted a pump but we were poor 22 year olds.  The whole process took like 10 seconds from picture to being full.  \n  \nI have a bunch of documentation, images, and videos somewhere.  The whole thing started after we made a CO2 pressurized keg pump so we could fill party cups by pressing a single button lol.",

I don't think my code could have handled live audio data stream simultaneously run through an FFT, so I would have been sampling chunks.  Now I'm sure it could be done on a weekend (excluding figuring out what gear to use) if the code isn't already available on google to ctrl+c.  \n  \nIsolating the environment is tricky for both imaging and audio, everything is always easier in a lab.  That said, I'd probably use optics or lazers now, even though they both have their problems with water.  Sensors and embedded computers are a lot better now.   ",

A poorly made light not only reduces the color spectrum of a room (pictures look the wrong color and can cause problems with art and photography), but can also pulse at a low enough frequency that, while not noticeable, is still perceived by the eye and causes problems. \n  \nThis is because LED\u2019s use DC electricity while the power grid uses AC. Since the LED can only use the \u201cpeak\u201d of the waveform, it relies on capacitors to carry it through the \u201ctrough\u201d and a special transformer to \u201csmooth out\u201d the current. \n \nThat being said, LED\u2019s are freaking amazing and are great for indirect lighting and ambient lighting in a room.

This is an androgynous child we're talking about. Not Fonz material. BZZZ.\n\nSecond of all, the Fonz exuded cool naturally. He didn't need a costume and some ridiculous acts of kindness to be perceived as cool. He was au naturale, baby. This kid ain't Fonz cool. BZZZ.\n\nThird of all, the Fonz was played by a Jewish actor. The Fonz finally gave a cool character to Jews on TV. So important for the Jewish culture and representation. Is this kid Jewish?

This thing tracks around the room, around furniture back to the base, charges, then goes right back to where it left off and picks up the job again.",

Once every few years rare. Well the night before they both must have had something that upset their stomachs. I went downstairs to see 2 sets of poo smeared EVERYWHERE due to the roomba starting up automatically in the dog area.  Both dogs, wigging out, roomba bumping into a poo pile it shoved against the wall. It was chaos. It took about 2 hours to clean the poo out of the room. It took about a week (evenings after work) to take apart the roomba, clean the poo out of the nooks, crannies, and electronics, and put it back together. I screwed up 1 sensor and pulled out a wire by accident but other than that the roomba has made a full recovery and is cleaning as I type this!",

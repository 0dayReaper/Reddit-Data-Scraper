They usually go in various sizes and are not very expensive. Search for \u201cArabica coffee plant\u201d or \u201ccoffea arabica\u201d.\n\n- Apparently it can grow beans, but I don\u2019t really count on it. I have a larger one at home and it\u2019s been growing steadily for the past year or so, but never sprouted any beans as well.\n\n- It will not leak water since the container is a closed one with substrate at the bottom. \n\n- The hole in the desk is for cable management and its factory drilled. It comes with a plastic insert that allows you to close it off, but mine didn\u2019t have it in there.",

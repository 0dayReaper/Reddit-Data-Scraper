Almost nothing good will come out of hearing from the buyer. Only exception would be if you had a garage queen and were selling it to a similarly enthusiastic/mature buyer.\n\nThe one and only time I sold a car private sale, my license plate bolts were so fucking rusted on I couldn't get it off. Against my better judgement I let the guy drive it home to get some tools, then later he texted me asking if I could meet at a strip club to get my plate back \ud83d\ude2c",

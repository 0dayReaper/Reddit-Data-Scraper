Proved in this case means that a mathematical proof was made for the solution, using logic and the principles of math to show that no smaller square would work. Found means that the solution appears to be the smallest we can make, but there is no formal proof that shows no smaller one exists. Proofs are important because they demonstrate from basic rules that something is or is not possible.\n\nThis difference is important these days because computers can be used to generate lots of \"tries\" at a problem like this. If the computer makes billions of squares, none of which are smaller, does that mean it is actually the smallest? No, because the computer didn't test *every* solution. But once we've made trillions and haven't done better, is it practically proven? Yes, though it's up to the math community to identify that tipping point based on their experience.",

The record somehow is still 99.5m. No one has thrown poop further than that.\n\nIs 99.5m the *proven maximum?* we do not know.

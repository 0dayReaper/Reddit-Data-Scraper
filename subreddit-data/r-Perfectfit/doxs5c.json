Maybe even work as an employee for the Tesco department stores, and get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I'll stop smoking, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone, even to someone with a nice pair of hands.",

Multiply that by \u03c0 for the increase in circumference - about 6 mm. \n\nAgain, being generous let's say paper towel is 2 bucks a roll. A quick Google tells me a standard roll has one hundred 11 x 11 inch sheets. Which is of course 279.4 mm. \n\nAssuming a 5% cost, the manufacturer spends 10\u00a2 per roll or 0.036\u00a2/mm on the paper, which equates to a savings of 0.215\u00a2 on the production of the slightly smaller cardboard tube.\n\nBut guess what? According to Wikipedia, America uses 7.8 Million Tonnes of paper towel per year. My shitty math puts 4 rolls to the kilo, so that's 31.2 BILLION rolls of paper towel annually. So if Bounty which has let's say a third of the marketshare decided to switch their ten billion rolls to the slightly smaller tube, they would save over $20,000,000 annually.\n\nI started this out of boredom but I guess the moral of the story is buy less paper towel?",

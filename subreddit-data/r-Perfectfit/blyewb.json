Since the area around the pop-up drain is covered with water quickly, the air escapes through the upper holes. Try running the water on full, then plug the hole with your finger and see if the water stops draining. Then remove fingers and watch it drain!",

Notice the holes are almost always too small to take all the incoming water if the tap is even halfway open.\n\n  \n\n\nThey also allow air to escape, so the drain functions properly. If you have a sink with the pop up drain plug, turn the water on, then plug the top drain hole with your fingers. Most sinks will start to slowly fill up because the air between the trap and the water you're pouring in has nowhere to go. Remove fingers, drain works again.\n\n  \n\n\nThey can also get \"stale\" and have stuff grow in there. If you ever run the water in your sink and it starts to stink, first check for hair/clogs in the stopper. If not, it's probably stagnant water growing bacteria or mold in this drain down near the bottom of the sink.\n\n  \n\n\nLarger openings or non-popup drains don't need the overflow holes.",

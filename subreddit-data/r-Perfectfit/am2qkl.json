From lumber liquidators, if you have one near. Some of the pieces were crappy and warped, but it worked out fine. If you had a helper, you could get a decent amount done in a day. One person picks out the starts and lays out stacks and the other person sets it and nails it. If your first person is getting ahead, they can cut the ends, which also become beginning pieces. Dont kid yourself though, it fuckin sucks, and if you have literally anything more interesting to do, you'll wanna do it. But hard wood looks great. ",

My up close vision took about a week to stabilize but my distance only took about a day and the flap healed in a day. LASIK vs PRK is about near instant recovery vs cost. But with days of missed work for PRK you still have a raised cost, just not the full difference to LASIK. Also, if I recall correctly, I don't think PRK fixes astigmatisms. I wasn't dropping that much money to still have an astigmatism and need corrective lenses.\n\nBoth surgeries have benefits and drawbacks. I'd consult a doctor.",

Same price generally as LASIK as the procedure is mostly the same, it involves a much smaller incision without the need of lifting the flap. Reduced halos and less dry eye are some benefits, however it does not fix astigmatism. I asked if I was a good candidate, but my doctor said he\u2019d much rather I go with LASIK so he could address the very minor astigmatism I had in one of my eyes.",

                                    "comment": "I got LASIK with fairly bad vision, my prescription lenses were -7.25 on both eyes. I had an astigmatism as well. I did full LASIK with a laser-cut flap and waveform scan. I was fully awake and alert, no relaxer like vallium or anything. It was a little odd and smelled like burning hair but was not painful or uncomfortable in the moment.\n\nSide note- after a TON of research and against my eye doc's wishes I did it in Seoul, South Korea. I was a confirmed 'perfect' candidate in the US from my eye doctor of twenty years and a opthomologist who could perform the procedure. I saved about two grand doing it overseas and got a cool trip out of it. My Korean doctor was US board certified, had recommendations from the company that makes eye surgery lasers and spoke perfect English. I definitely took a risk, though.\n\nMy surgery had me blurry but better than before right away. I had my surgery my first full day in, got my eye drops and wore sunglasses back to my hostel. Things were clearing up minute by minute but the soreness and light sensitivity were insane. I walked with sunglasses on and grabbed a backpack of a friend who went with through the subway and had eyes closed and followed directions to squint when we hit stairs. The next day I wore sunglasses but my vision was perfect. It was still sensitive but manageable. My first checkup the day after had me at 20/20. Day two the soreness was gone and I was perfect. I went for a one-week with my doctor and got my all clear to fly home.\n\nOne month later my eye doctor of twenty years scolded me and gave me a 20/15. A year later I was still 20/15. I'm two years post-LASIK and my 3500 was well-spent, that was surgery, airfare, hostel and food/drink/souvenirs/tours.\n\nI don't think my method of flying overseas is for everyone. Any surgery has risk for complication. Being in a country where you do not speak the language means if you have a medical emergency where you need to go to an ER there is a risk of not finding a doctor who speaks your language.\n\nA few sites run these horror-story stats on LASIK but it seems to be unfounded. I've not met one LASIK patient who regrets it bar one person who had PRK back twenty years ago. She had the halos at night. Except, as explained by my doctors halos occur when you were never a good candidate. Basically, they can correct a certain width of cornea. If your iris dialates beyond the corrected field you have halos due to the unfocused light. Your eyes dialate further at night, hence nightime halos. Also, some people have too thin of corneas or the cornea is the wrong shape and you cannot correct evenly or to 20/20. Most complications occur for people who should have never been told yes by a doctor.\n\nThe rate of complications like infection run about 1/1000 and my clinic had 1/3000 so I felt confident having been confirmed as a good candidate by two doctors, one who would be losing a patient and stood to gain no money from it and in the clinic I chose.\n\nWhatever you do, look into the doctor you choose, understand the different types of procedures, be honest on whether you can actually afford an out of pocket procedure and get confirmed as a good candidate for LASIK. Some places advertise 299/ 599 an eye but you won't want the level of care that provides, more than likely. They have sales reps who upsell and you'll spend just as much as having a non-pushy doctor who isn't jamming through patients like a factory worker. Also, the eye drops are about $500 and most insurance covers 0% of your costs for LASIK, including eye drops.\n\nGood luck!",

Now there are laser and lens exchange options that give multifocal vision.\n\nMost of the stuff coming through at the moment is refining this so that the distance has to be compromised less in order to give the reading vision.",

Until recently Lasik was not even approved, even though PRK has a harsher recovery period. Regardless of PRK\u2019s reputation for being more a of a pain in the ass than Lasik, it was still very smooth. A good amount of pain in the first three days, for which I was prescribed Oxycotin. After that, no pain. A little bit of blurriness at night for the first several months, but after 6 months of the steroid eye drops to encourage the tissue to grow back, my vision was 20/15 in all conditions. I am very happy with the results. And for only ~$3500 after a military discount, I think that the ROI is very good, considering it\u2019s easy to spend that amount for 10 years of contacts and glasses. In my mind it was very worth it, even if it wasn\u2019t a military requirement. ",

When I scuba dived I got prescription goggles and my doctor adjusted my prescription by a few points off my glasses to account for the water. My vision got worse but I kept my slightly off goggles as it was better than replacing the lenses. Now that I got LASIK my dad inhereted my scuba goggles and they're close enough for him.",

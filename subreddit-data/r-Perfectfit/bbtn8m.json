That means they have to import all of their fuel through ports, which is more expensive than piping it. They also have a number of different blends of gas that they use for pollution control at various times of year, which also drives up the cost. Lastly the taxes in California are high, in large part to convince people to consider their driving habits carefully and promote the use of public transit. All this works together to make California's gas about twice the cost of the national average.",

Not sure where you're getting hit for 1.70, but I would assume it's remote?\n\nGasBuddy shows that in Ontario, there are lots of gas stations selling around $1CAD/liter(or $2.82USD/Gal).\n\nOntario minimum wage is $14CAD(or $10.46USD).\n\nUS average gas price for the whole country is $2.50USD/Gal.\n\nUS minimum wage is $7.25USD.\n\nIn Ontario, the minimum wage is 44% higher than the US.  The gas costs 12% more.  So at least there, gas is relatively *much cheaper* than in the US.\n\nIf you live somewhere more rural, I'm sure it skews much more unfavorably, but I bet if you did the math and currency conversions it would be much closer breakeven than you think.\n\nEDIT: I decided to look at the worst case scenario.  If you're paying $1.70CAD/L ($4.80USD/gal) and you live in Saskatchewan ($10.96CAD/$8.19USD minimum), minimum wage is 13% higher and gas costs 96% more.  So that sucks.",

In Manitoba it was about 90c a litre the other month and its up to 1.30 now and increasing :/\n\nAs well as minimum wage I believe is $11.30 or so in Manitoba as well.

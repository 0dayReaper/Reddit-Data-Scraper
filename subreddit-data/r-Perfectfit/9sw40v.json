Several years ago, we finally got to tour the inside.  There was a spot like this in the house that went from the front to the back.  I have no idea why it was so short (it was a little taller than this).  But basically 80% of our group, including my uncles, could walk right through the little passageway without ducking.  We were all cracking up that it was a heredity check to see who really belonged in the family.",

The house had a strongly pitched roof, so all of the upstairs rooms had sloped ceilings, except for one bedroom on the back had normal ceilings.  I asked the contractor to finish off a small secret passageway. One of the twins rooms had a separate playroom attached to it, it was in an area that had slopped ceilings on both sides. Instead of it being storage, I wanted it to be a fun area for them to play, it was tall in the middle, I could easily walk around. I felt guilty the other twin wouldn\u2019t have direct access. So we put a passage way from that room, behind the bathroom to the playroom. It was tall enough that a 4-5 year old could walk comfortably. \n\nSad note... we heard that the people who purchased it from us, closed it in.  It was exactly where you would put a dresser too, which would hide the little door. Made me so sad. \n\nPS... sorry for the novel. Lol. ",

I completely agree with you, had they been same sex twins, they would have shared it much longer.  I just want to say, twins are a very special blessing! I\u2019m a fortunate Momma!",

Two bedrooms got expanded into three.  The parents decided the oldest boy deserved his own room so they made the girls share.  The youngest boy twin was really too young to get his own room - he was a little freaked out by it.  But he's fine now.  The girls are coming up on 17 and 14 and still sharing.  My sister really wants to get a bigger house.  I say she needs to ~~kick the oldest boy out~~ invite the oldest boy to move out now that he's going to be 21.",

She was so shocked and overwhelmed, all I could think to say was, \"At least it's not triplets!\"  Through half of the pregnancy, we thought it was girl twins. She gave names to Baby A and Baby B. She had a baby shower, got a ton of pink and purple stuff. Then the next ultrasound revealed that Baby B was a boy. Oops. But I can't imagine not having our little man. He's such a fine young man. So cool and sweet. Also, she gave birth at a fairly  new hospital. She was the first to have twins naturally at this hospital. All previous twin births had been C sections.  ",

They were like, ok God wants us to have one more. Fast forward a month or 2. Her sonogram showed she was having, TRIPLETS!  She went from being done, with 2 kids, to suddenly having FIVE, lol ",

Or random stuff some medieval British kings pulled out of their ass. That jug there? It's 3 gallons. Or half a scheepslast (Henry VII). \n\nBut there are things that I do not do too.

So one day while my mom was cooking dinner, ( I had grown a inch or two) I though it would be a good idea to run full speed under it.  I move the chairs and run full steam, and whack the shit out of my forehead. I had a literal black and blue line across my forehead and probably a concussion.  Anyway my mom heard me slam into the countertop, scream in pain after I fell on the ground and ran over to help me, can't remember much after the fall.\n\nGood times...",

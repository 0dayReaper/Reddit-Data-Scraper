Back in the early 2010's, I was obsessed with the Planet Earth series. I watched the part about Cordyceps (*Jungles* I think?) with a girl who I would later date for a while. They totally blew her mind. Irresponsibly, I convinced her for a time that *human cordyceps* were a real thing. She for some reason believed me. The concept horrified her. Of course, I ended up telling her the truth after a short time. It's a fond memory of those times. Hopefully she doesn't see this. Sorry, Jelly!",

I rewatched that video like 8 times looking for milk and eggs! \n\nThanks for letting people know! It\u2019s funny that most fridge doors are specifically outfitted for eggs and milk and that\u2019s the last place you\u2019d want to store them! It\u2019s almost like they want you to spend more money bc your stuff will go bad quicker!",

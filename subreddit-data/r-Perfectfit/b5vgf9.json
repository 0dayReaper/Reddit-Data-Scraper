Take a sheet of paper and cut it into 1 inch by 1/2 inch strips. Then take a square 1/2 inch piece of tape, loop it so the adhesive side is facing outwards, and place it on one end of the paper, covering it completely. Then, for every mint in that drawer (approximately 189, so you'll need at least 2 pieces of 8.5x11 printer paper) stick the mint horizontally on the tape so the edge of the paper covered in adhesive tape is covered by the middle of the mint. Finally, fold the paper up so it forms a rough right angle on itself, allowing for me to easily grab a single mint from the drawer without struggling. This will take roughly 45 minutes, thank you.",

Large theater screens are curved to reduce image distortion and brightness drop off. \nFor some large cinema screens if you were to project against a flat screen the difference in distance of the lens to the center of the screen vs lens to edge can be 10ft or more, by curving the screen the light always travels the same distance so the whole image remains in focus. This used to be extremely important for anamorphic CinemaScope images due to the way the image was stretched. \nFor a curved TV you\u2019d have to be sitting extremely close to equalize your viewing angle distance for all but the largest sets and even with them you would be sitting much closer than what is recommended for proper viewing angles. Curved TVs in the vast majority of cases actually degrade the quality of viewing. ",

You get real bored looking in the high rise windows because everyone is just watching TV or surfing the internet.  \n\nIn fact realizing that everyone comes home at night and sits in front of a screen is why I try to get outside every single day it\u2019s nice out.

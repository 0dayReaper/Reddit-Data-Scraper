Distilled water won't make a difference whether it comes out clear, it needs to phase in the second stage of ice formation rather than the first, which requires top down cooling. Doesn't matter how cold your freezer is past freezing point, an insulated container is the only way you'll be able to make clear ice without spending a ton of money",

They looked like this https://i.imgur.com/oXV6w14.jpg. While they do work very well in making ice balls,  they were always a bitch to remove after. I always had to run the ice ball under a bit of warm water before it would come out.  \n\nThe silicone mold trays that look like https://i.imgur.com/crd2zuk.jpg are so much better.  They pop out of the trays with ease. \n\n\n\n\n",

I had a case of tonsillitis followed by pericoronitis, resulting in two molars being removed. Basically, solid food was hell for a month and a half and Soylent was a godsend. I had tried out Soylent a few years beforehand for two weeks when I first heard about it, so I wasn\u2019t going in blind.\n\nI decided to stick with it, since I\u2019m broke all the time. A subscription for 28 bags a month at $216 gets me five meals a day for about $1.50 each.\n\nThe main draws are that Soylent is a cheap, efficient, and healthy alternative to whatever thoughtless diet I had before hand. Now I can be thoughtless without feeling guilty.\n\nThere\u2019s a slew of other reasons why I\u2019ve stuck with a 95% Soylent diet for over a year: I don\u2019t have to waste time grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, physically eating, or going out to eat. I\u2019m vegetarian, but the Soylent formula is vegan, so that\u2019s a plus. I can fall asleep sooner than I ever did before, need less sleep, and wake up actually feeling refreshed (didn\u2019t know that was possible.) To top it off, it\u2019s given me the healthiest bowel movements of my life, which is a big deal considering I\u2019ve had constipation issues since I was young.\n\n^(This comment was not paid for by Soylent.)",

I've bought the water bottle too and ice cubes remain in the flask all day into the next. Can't complain. \nHave to add. The cafe cup 2.0 lid on the wide bottle is legit leakproof. I just throw it in my bag without worrying about it now. ",

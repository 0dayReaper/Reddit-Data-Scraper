And the design\u2019s a lot better, in my opinion, but that\u2019s subjective obviously. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how much you know about cards, but (good ones) will have a particular \u201cfinish\u201d which is the texture on the cards (dollar store cards, for example, won\u2019t have a finish and will just be printed on smooth card stock. These suck. Don\u2019t buy them). Bicycle Rider Back (the \u201cclassic\u201d Bicycle cards) cards have their \u201cAir Cushion Finish,\u201d which isn\u2019t bad, but if you can get your hands of Tally-Hos, their \u201cLinoid\u201d finish is just a lot smoother, the cards will literally just start sliding off the deck if you tilt them slightly. And they\u2019re only slightly more expensive than Rider Backs, but quite a bit harder to find. \n\nIt makes them really nice to use.",

But I've always had an affinity for a nice deck of cards since high when we used to play card games in class all the time. I've got one deck right now I really like. But that's mostly because it's pretty and not because the deck itself is quality. It's only nice to play now after I've broken it in a bit. I'd love to have an alternative to bicycle just for the sheer novelty. \n\nSo I noticed that you can pick up Tally Hos on Amazon for around $8-9 a pack. Is that excessive markup or about what I should expect to pay. And are they the decks you're talking about or lower quality versions? ",

Then you shuffle the deck and tell him to show him 4 cards and he should say if one of them is his one. None of them is his tho and people think you might have fucked up. Then you ask them to make a fist, place the cards between the fingers and hit the cards so they fall all down but one. His card in his own hand! \nVery nice effect. Do you know that one?",

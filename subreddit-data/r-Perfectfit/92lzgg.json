It might not end up being your thing, but at the least I think most people would say watching it wasn't a waste of their time. And it's a modern classic of the genre. It's worth seeing just so you can say you've seen it. \n\nPersonally though, I think it's one of my favourite movies. It does space opera action adventure comedy in a way I never imagined and haven't seen since. Guardians of the Galaxy movies are close, and in some ways superior, but it's not exactly the same sort of thing. The performances by Gary Oldman, Ian Holm and Chris Tucker are amazing, but really the whole cast is phenomenal. The direction is also top notch with many amazingly cut scenes and transitions. \n\nIt's on Netflix in Canada at least, but not sure about availability elsewhere. If you have a couple hours to spare, I'd say it's the perfect thing to spend them on.",

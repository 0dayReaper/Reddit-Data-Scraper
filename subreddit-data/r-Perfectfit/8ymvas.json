The two red pixels were stoned out of their mind you see, and the one black pixel just kind of took the opportunity and ran with it.

If you are talking about a framed opening them finding a mattress or cushion that fits as tight as ops is actually really unlikely and you would probably have to make it yourself. Any air gaps and it probably wouldn't be as effective as the door wouldd anyway. Beyond that making the room quiter would probably involve installing acoustic insulation in the walls or oversheeting the walls with a sound rated gyprock.

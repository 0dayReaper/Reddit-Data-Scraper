Resulting in parts of the room never being cleaned no matter how long it runs for.\n\nThe newest bots have AI and room scanning technology. The Xiaomi for example will make perfectly straight lines back and forth across the room, and perfectly circle around a table leg.\n\nThe new ones can theoretically keep the whole room clean, reliably. The older ones are just a crap shot hoping the roomba decides to drive over that crumb and doesn't just brush it out of the way or not suck it up because its bin is full.",

My wife was getting really sick of vacuuming, so I got her a sneaky Roomba 870 gift a couple days ago and it\u2019s amazing. Our house is somewhat cluttered with couches and tables etc, but the little guy navigates and makes his way around the house, eventually covering everywhere and getting into places I never thought it would. I\u2019m totally blown away by how capable it is and how good the house looks. The little rotating brush on the side is amazing, it flicks dirt out from under places you didn\u2019t know where so dirty (dishwasher, chair and table legs). If anyone\u2019s considering getting one, do it, you won\u2019t regret it. My wife doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever have to vacuum again, unless it\u2019s for a specific mess or for cleaning filters etc. My only regret is not getting one of the really fancy ones that allow you to view the virtual maps it makes of your house and control it via wifi, but they\u2019re pretty darn pricey.\n\nEdit: holy shit that sounds like an ad.",

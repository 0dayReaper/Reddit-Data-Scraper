Description:

We're a subreddit for things that surprisingly and satisfyingly fit perfectly into each other.   

And we'd love to have you join us! 



Originally inspired by http://thingsfittingperfectlyintothings.tumblr.com/

Rules:

No porn.: There's other subreddits for that kind of thing, but this isn't one of them.

No alignment screenshots/desktop screenshots.: These kinds of 2D screenshots are easy to manipulate and are generally low effort as well; try /r/juxtaposition or /r/screenshots for these kinds of fits. Fits in open-world games and other 3D environments are permitted.

No artisan fits or pet fits.: /r/ArtisanVideos and /r/IfItFits are just a few of the numerous subreddits dedicated to these kinds of fits and would be more than happy to host these kinds of content.

No tapered objects or containers.: Common examples of these would be a cup in a cup or a ball in a cup, but they are defined as objects that would fit regardless if one object was bigger or smaller; however, tapered objects that only touch at their respective equators are acceptable.
Another thing that doesn't fall into this category is objects that fit into a cup but are not tapered and would no fit into a cup if they were bigger or smaller, https://gfycat.com/AncientFragrantCoqui that is a good example of that.

No recent reposts or upper-level 'Top' reposts.: No one likes seeing the same content again and again. This also includes compilation gifs/albums featuring mostly reposts or websites that are a collection of fits.

No low-effort fits.: Uninterestingly intentional fits and "everyday fits" (fits that use items such as bottles, caps, rings, tape, shelves, cabinets, lids, boxes, cans, jars, coins, any smaller common items, and any kind of liquid fits) are generally removed as they are usually both unsurprising and uninteresting.

Be nice.: Do you love us? Hate us? Have an idea? Have a problem? Think your post has been removed? Whatever it is, let us know and we'll get right back to you. Remember, all-inclusive rules are impossible in a subreddit as subjective as this, but we do our best to ensure the best experience for everyone-- even if that means making exceptions for posts or modifying rules.

No car doors: Anything that can be moved into a perfect fit with a modicum of effort constitutes an unsurprisingly intentional fit as detailed below. The prime example is a car door opening into something else and barely missing it

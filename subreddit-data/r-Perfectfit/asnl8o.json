Someone had the job of raising or lowering each shelf to accommodate the items on that shelf and placing the price tickets. My job was to then come along and fill said shelves with the correct items in their correct place. Well EVERY FUCKING TIME I went to do it the shelves had not been adjusted and my items wouldn't fit. Ended up having to take the time to adjust the shelves myself. I complained to the management but nothing ever changed. In the end I just ended up laying the items down flat if they wouldn't fit, it looked shit but I really couldn't care by that point. So glad my retail days are behind me.",

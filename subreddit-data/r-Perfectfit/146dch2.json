Also they\u2019re different plastics. Maybe they used the same CAD programs with the same default shapes?",

The only reason I would think it could be two places would be the different plastic, but from the picture, they look the same.\n\nNo brand and \"fancy\" stuff being made at the same shop is super common. Sometimes they'll even just change the box. Costco's Kirland brand is an excellent example, and also Amazon Basics.\n\nOn a completely different note, I have basically the exact same floor. Lowe's Sawgrass Oak https://www.lowes.com/pd/Style-Selections-Sawgrass-Oak-6-in-x-36-in-Water-Resistant-Peel-and-Stick-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring-1-5-sq-ft/5001956783\n\nmight not be the EXACT same, but very close. They have a few different types that a very similar.",

You wouldn\u2019t be able to reuse part of the die for something else. Also, if they were produced from the same mold, they\u2019d be the same size and wouldn\u2019t fit together.",

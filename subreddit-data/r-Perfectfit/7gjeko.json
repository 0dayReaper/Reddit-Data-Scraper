Any ratio of helium and air is going to result in a floating point, where the weight of the compressed air and the helium\u2019s buoyancy equalize with the atmospheric pressure outside.

It might take some fiddling, but sure! Although it\u2019s easier to make it slightly more buoyant than needed and compensate with weights. ",

Since electrons are negative, they are attracted to the positive side of the magnet. \nWhen you place a magnet on any iron based object, it causes the atoms' dipoles to align in the same direction as the magnet. This means the electrons of the iron will be attracted to the positive side of the magnet. This attraction is the pulling force we feel caused by the magnet. What if you put the magnet negative side down onto the ferric substance? This time the magnet's electrons will be pulling on the ferric substance.\n\nAnd this isn't a shit post, its actually how it works :)",

Our can bin is right in front of it. Someone had tossed a can lid at the garbage, missed, and it went perfectly though one of the slats and then directly over the drain hole. Very difficult to notice.\n\nAnyway, I unplugged the sink drain and walked away, letting about 50 gallons of water overflow the secondary drain and flood the back.\n\nI learned two things.\n\nFirst, that our floor is not graded down toward the floor overflow drain, but rather straight back toward the computer/cable/surveillance/alarm system corner. The drain was actually sitting dry like an island. Water went everywhere but. \n\nSecond, that you should always check the drain first.",

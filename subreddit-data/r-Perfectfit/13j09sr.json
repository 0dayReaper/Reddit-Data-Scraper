My favourite so far was where with how we buy our pickles presliced, some we get clearly went into the slicing machine at an angle, so rather than being a circular end piece, they're long strips. I had one such long strip, and our policy is three pickles per burger. So it made a cute smiley face :) I very happily showed it around to my coworkers.",

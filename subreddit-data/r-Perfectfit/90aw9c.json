Cremo and Richard L. Thompson, written in association with the Bhaktivedanta Institute of ISKCON. Cremo states that the book has \"over 900 pages of well-documented evidence suggesting that modern man did not evolve from ape man, but instead has co-existed with apes for millions of years!\", and that the scientific establishment has suppressed the fossil evidence of extreme human antiquity. Cremo identifies as a \"Vedic archeologist\", since he believes his findings support the story of humanity described in the Vedas. Cremo's work has garnered interest from Hindu creationists, paranormalists, and theosophists. He says a knowledge filter (confirmation bias) is the cause of this suppression.The book has attracted attention from some mainstream scholars as well as Hindu creationists and paranormalists.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Perfectfit/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

I don't remember which tribe it is but the practice is awful. When daughters' breasts begin to show, the mother will 'iron' them. A flat and thick piece of wood is heated in an open fire, wrapped in fabric and the mother presses it onto her daughter's breasts. The idea is to prevent the breasts to show so boys don't get any ideas. As a woman I can't even imagine how painful this is for the girls.",

Like, that just hurts my heart. I can\u2019t imagine a loving mother looking their kid in the eye and having to cause them that kind of pain.\n\nAnd those board contraptions that ancient people put their babies in to change their skull shapes... i looked those up last night, and even IF eventually the pain subsided, that still wouldn\u2019t fix how they were actually strapped down onto it and couldn\u2019t move one inch for themselves. Looks like it literally restricted any free movement! \n\nI swear, having a child of my own has definitely changed my outlook on a whole lot of stuff. I can\u2019t imagine ever being able to willfully cause my baby harm or any kind of discomfort. And I DEFINITELY can\u2019t believe that there are still tribal peoples around the world that are uneducated and literally don\u2019t even know any better. Seems like it should be classified as genital mutilation and be outlawed to ever even do...",

I don't know how long elongating the skulls went on for but it's all so barbaric. There are a lot of things that tribal people do to their children because it's cultural. One that comes to mind is cutting the skin many times creating designs and patterns when it heals. This is part of some kind of right of passage and is extremely painful. Let's just be thankful that cannibalism finally stopped!",

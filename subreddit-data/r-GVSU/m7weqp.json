Work-wise it hasn't been bad, only 4 SAS homework assignments so far, and 1 midterm exam. The SAS homework sets were not that difficult, and as long as you pay attention in class and study a bit, the exam was not that difficult either. The lectures are a bit dry but I've had worse. I'm not sure if there's any work discrepancy between 426 and 526. I know Pearson mentioned it at the beginning of the semester that he *could* assign more work, but I've yet to hear anything about him doing so. You could always email him and ask if you want more of the specifics. Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "postText": "Not sure if it's like this at the other dining halls because I've only been to Kleiner so far, but last night I went around 6 and the place was packed pretty tight, no room for social distancing, and a few without masks. There weren't any staff trying to regulate people to wait in line or see whether or not the hall was at capacity for people (i'm pretty sure it was way over). I'm not trying to police everything and be that person, but if GVSU isn't even putting effort forth to enforce their own COVID-19 policies we're going to get sent home pretty quickly, and I just don't want to have to move home after having just moved in. Is anyone else seeing super crowded dining areas?",

Many larger groups of sometimes up to 15 people looking dine in together. On top of that as soon as they sit down masks come off and I can see they all cram into cars together to carpool so lots of close contact between everyone. I\u2019m just waiting for the big outbreaks to happen.",

Doesn't help that many Freshmen are from out of state and are used to different rules and regulations. Shutdown here we come!",

It doesn\u2019t help that freshmen don\u2019t really have the best chance to cook their own food either (besides for the ones in apartment style).",

I'm pretty nervous about covid-19 and have been doing things to keep myself protected, but seriously, I bet you the dining halls will be the place where the inevitable covid-19 outbreak begins. The actual area where you order your food is not equipped for social distancing, and neither is the dining room, and obviously people don't wear masks when they are eating.  Yesterday I watched people move tables and chairs so that they could sit with like 6+ people while they ate. And I was under the impression that dining rooms would be closed and food would be given to us in to-go boxes to take back to our rooms, but maybe I got confused in the tons of emails they sent to us.",

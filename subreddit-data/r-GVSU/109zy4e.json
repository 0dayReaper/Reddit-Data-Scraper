They\u2019ve got good connections too. I got a pretty good job out of college but I did extracurricular stuff, so prioritize that. \n\nMSU is a great journalism school. Better than GVSU, but Grand Valley is closing the gap, though it\u2019ll probably never fully pull even.",

They each have their own specialty and push their students to explore every aspect of Journalism. I highly recommend reaching out to Len O\u2019Kelly and talking to him directly about the program. Not only do these professors care about you as a student but after you graduate they care about your continued success. I can not recommend GVSU\u2019s CMJ program enough. \n\nSource: I have a degree from GVSU in CMJ",

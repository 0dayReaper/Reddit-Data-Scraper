I found the classes to be a lot more interesting than the gen ed offerings and you\u2019ll also get some great professors! Some of my favorite classes were Honors classes - I chose the East Asian Civ sequence, taught in part by the wonderful Professor Benjamin. There was also one about the Holocaust that was deeply fascinating. No matter what you take, expect to be challenged, but the workload was never too overwhelming in my experience. \n\nMy only wish is that I didn\u2019t live in Niemeyer. While the dorms themselves were lovely, I found it very hard to make friends with people on my floor as everyone kept their doors shut, which honestly was pretty disappointing. However, that was just my experience! This was almost ten years ago (wow!), so take my input with a grain of salt. \n\nGood luck with your college endeavors and of course, feel free to shoot me any questions you might have!",

This was fine for me since I made my friend group elsewhere so I had a nice room plus a good friend group, but yeah, you probably won't make friends just visiting dorms in Niemeyer.",

            "comment": "A lot of people think honors classes are harder, but that's really not the case at all for most of them. My favorite class of all time was my honors sequence (aka the 6-credit-per-semester first-year course that every honors student takes, but GVSU calls them sequences for some reason); it was Big History with Craig Benjamin. Literally the coolest dude I've ever met, and the curriculum was really designed to help students grow as writers and learners without stressing over tests or a ton of reading every week. I've heard the opposite about some other sequences, though, so keep in mind that each one can really vary.\n\nSequences are also great for finishing gen ed requirements quicker, which is useful for getting to classes in your major quicker and potentially making room for another minor to fit into your schedule. \n\nMy junior seminar was also interesting, I took one about medical controversies as an online class during the summer and it was a pretty light workload. Cool topic too. Coeli Fitzpatrick taught it and I really liked her.\n\n//\n\nTLDR: Honors coursework is usually thought of as harder and higher-level than normal courses, but that depends on the courses you choose. Sometimes, like in my case, the courses can be less work than a normal courses and end up leaving you with more knowledge and a better understanding of your favorite ways to learn. Do Honors if you have the chance!",

The sequence was a lot of work (6 credits) but it was really interesting (mine was about medieval history) and I really got to know some of my classmates since it was a smaller size. However I will say that the junior seminar and senior project are less exciting and feel like more of a burden that doesn't really help that much with my major so there are pros and cons",

I lost my taste and smell Monday so I got a test that day and I\u2019m waiting for my results which won\u2019t come in until Wednesday. I have an in person exam today, however I\u2019ve emailed my professor multiple times yesterday and today and I have gotten no response. Is there anyone I can contact regarding and issue like this? \n\nThanks in advance!",

They will probably light a fire under that person to get back to you :)",

If approved, it might allow you to postpone the final exam until you're recovered (which hopefully will be soon!). Here are the details, at least in my college (College of Liberal Arts and Sciences): https://www.gvsu.edu/clas/incomplete-grades-how-to-change-554.htm",

    "postText": "So I am currently a student, but did not buy a parking pass (overpriced scam). A friend of mine is looking to explore the main campus in Allendale on Friday, but I\u2019m wondering where the safest place is to park without being towed or booted while I show her around. Library seems to obvious. I rarely spend time at the main campus, is there a nearby guest lot I\u2019m not aware of? Could I email someone about a guest pass? Or no dice because of Covid? \nAnything helps!",

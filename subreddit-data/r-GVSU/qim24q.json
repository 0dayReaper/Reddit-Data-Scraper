Instead of instantly kicking me out of Honors, they made an appointment to talk to me about it, helped me make a plan to turn my grades around, helped me make appointments with counseling, and didn\u2019t kick me out. They said I could stay on as an Honors student on probation, and as long as i continued to improve, and as long as my grades got back up to 3.2 overall GPA, I could still graduate with honors. \n\nWe all know that the further you get, the harder it is to bring up your overall GPA. I managed to graduate with just over a 3.2, with Honors. That was 3 years of technically being on probation with the honors college. \n\nThey helped me, made it work, were the first to reach out and ask what was going on. I felt taken care of. And that\u2019s before we even discuss the actual academics of the honors college! I loved Making of Europe (do they still offer that?)! When my class schedule didn\u2019t allow for it, they helped me rearrange my schedule for different honors classes to finish out my honors requirements. \n\nWhen my brother almost died in Saginaw, I called my professors during midterm week to let them know. My honors prof threatened to lock me out of the classroom if I tried to come in while my family needed me. He reassured me that I could make up my midterm when my brother was in the clear and I could think straight. \n\nI lived in Hills Honors dorm in north campus freshman year, then Niemeyer. I can\u2019t recommend it enough. Get to know a few people in your dorm too. \n\nI didn\u2019t have a single bad experience with Honors at GV. In fact, it was probably because of them that I was able to get my life back together when my mental and physical health took a turn and my parents got divorced suddenly at the same time and my grades suffered. \n\nIf you have the chance, I say go for it. You need as many people in your corner as you can get. Don\u2019t be afraid to go to them for help with just about anything. Take advantage of the great resource they are. \n\nAnd good luck!!",

Recommend the Middle East beyond the headlines sequence, really interesting and fun.. not to hard either",

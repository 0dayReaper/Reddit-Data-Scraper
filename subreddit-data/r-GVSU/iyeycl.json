The amount of people I spoke with who stated they were going out of town this weekend to party is astonishing. As is the lack of empathy for the people ravaged by this disease.",

It's not so much these two weeks, as not knowing what might come next.",

It said somewhere that gatherings of 4-6 people are where it comes from but that honestly is a lot. I literally hang out with nobody on campus and nobody in the apartments. I just want to visit with my family and friends who all live in other places. I feel like the parties are the source of the problem because we were all hanging out with people in our respective hometowns this summer as much as we are now. What is the difference? Parties.",

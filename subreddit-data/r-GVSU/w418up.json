My understanding is that 241 and 242 are for the students who would need more organic chem in the future where as 245 is more of the one stop shop class for majors that will see it in their field, but not really need to know specifics. My wife was in the nursing program and had to take CHEM 245 if I remember correctly. But if you\u2019ve already taken 241, I\u2019m pretty sure requirements wise you have to take 242",

So Biochem, nursing, etc majors would typically take 245 and other majors would take 242. But I could be wrong.",

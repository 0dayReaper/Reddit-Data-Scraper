            "comment": "Former GVSU athletic director Tim Selgo wrote this blog post back in 2014 detailing why, at the time, we weren't moving out of Division II. It's well worth a read for the fine details. https://timselgo.tumblr.com/post/91953816804/why-is-gvsu-staying-in-ncaa-division-ii \n\nAmong the many reasons we didn't jump to D1 earlier, as the article explains, is that it would basically double the cost of running the athletics programs, even just to be somewhat competitive. Selgo points out the fact that you can't just move football to D1 -- if you want to do that, you have to move **all sports** to D1.",

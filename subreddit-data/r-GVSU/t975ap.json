Does anybody have experience with either of these school's programs that you'd be willing to share? Any particular reason you'd choose one over the other? I'd appreciate any thoughts.",

            "comment": "\n\nWell im currently a senior studying engineering. GV only has about 5 engineering majors to choose from: computer, electrical, mechanical, product design, and biomed. Im pretty sure WMU has way more. However your class sizes wont ever be bigger than about 30 people here at GV. Every professor youll have has had some form of industry experience, and ive never had lecture not taught by a professor. You also do a 3 semester co-op rotation at GV with a local company that basically gives you about a years worth of experience in the real world. However  because of this, most people end up having to go 5 years to fit all their classes in. Some do it in 4, but its a bit more challenging. Also, i will say resource availabilty at the engineering school is very low, and if you want to really get into reseach WMU probably better.",

I am on a four year track and, from what I can see, it is significantly harder to do it in 4. I definitely agree that resource availability is very low. I\u2019d also like to point out that although you do 3 semester co-op rotations, your summers are essentially all gone because you will have to take classes during them and you don\u2019t really have any opportunity to take an internship at another company outside of your co-op. I would highly suggest the 5 year program over the 4 year",

PM if you have particular questions. \n\nTo boil it down to the basics - GV you will have a better undergrad experience. The classes are small, you\u2019ll only be taught by real profs, and they put a ton of work into teaching undergrads and do it well. WMU has the much better research budget so their focus is more on grad students, you\u2019ll have big undergrad classes, TAs teaching you, and not much individual attention. However, as grad student you\u2019d have a ton of labs and equipment available to you that GV does not. \n\nSo I think it depends on if you want to do undergrad and then get a job or if you are thinking of grad school. The majors are very similar between the two and honestly, your engineering major doesn\u2019t really matter that much in the grand scheme of things. \n\nFinal Recommendation: GV for undergrad and WMU for grad school if you want that.",

            "comment": "I graduated in computer engineering in 2017. I am very happy that I chose to go to GV. The small class sizes mean that you get better attention from the professors, and it's always real professors who are teaching your courses, not graduate assistants. The curriculum is extremely hands-on with both labs and three semesters of co-op. That hands-on experience will serve you very well when you get to the real world of engineering. It's super valuable to future employers, and will help you to better understand the materials.\n\nDifficulty wise I'd say it's on par with many other engineering programs, if not slightly easier thanks to the hands-on approach.",

He went to WMU for his MBA and engineering PhD. I'm not sure what he's doing now, but I know he was there for at least a year. His mental health started to deteriorating pretty badly. Poor guy.\n\nDon't get too caught up in the whole prof vs TA thing though, you'll likely be relying on classmates and the tutoring center sooner or later if you go to GVSU. Granted, I mostly dealt with the Computer Science dept., but there are profs who went straight from grad school to teaching. It's really not that common for profs to have a lot of tangible real world experience.",

The intro classes are there to get your foot into different aspects of engineering like coding, using CAD, and circuits. These classes are definitely a lot to take on at first, especially if you don\u2019t have any experience with the material. However I think that almost of the professors do a great job at teaching the material, and they definitely know what they are talking about and are willing to help. The classes are definitely tough, but finding friends in your engineering classes and using your resources definitely helps a lot.",

            "comment": "This may be an unpopular opinion, but GV\u2019s engineering program is overblown. \n\nI am not in the program but I know many people who either started in the program and left, or people who are currently finishing up their last year in the program. While I totally understand that a STEM program such as engineering is gonna be intense, the program at GV is almost impossibly difficult. In the intro 100-level classes GV seems to try very hard to turn away as many students as they can cause many students to become entirely disenfranchised with STEM. In later classes, students are essentially guaranteed failure regardless of how much they study. I have a good friend who spends on average 12 hours on campus everyday studying in the Lib until it closes and they still only come away with B and C\u2019s. \n\nAlso, you are pretty much guaranteed not to finish in 4 years. \n\nThe advice of everyone else in this thread is solid, but I did want to share something about the culture of the program. Take it or leave it. Bur good luck!",

But theres a difference between a class that is designed to challenge you and one that is designed for you to fail. \n\nI am also in STEM, Chemistry. Arguably just as difficult and work intensive as engineering. None of my classes were designed for failure. Hard but not impossible. \n\nNot trying to fight you on this. I just feel pretty strongly that higher ed should be made as accessible as possible. \n\nYou\u2019re right tho, its not a business major ;)",

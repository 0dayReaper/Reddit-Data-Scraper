I couldn't really find a one-bedroom in a reputable complex for less than $1000 a month, so I ended up renting a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom at campus west for $895 a month (about $450 for each bedroom). It worked out great for this year because I made the spare bedroom my office. I've had nothing but great experiences with Campus West!! This is a great deal, in my opinion. I'd definitely look into it! Their one-bedrooms are also super nice, they just didn't have any available when I signed my lease, so I'm not sure what those run per month. The only thing I wish Campus West had was a pool, but you can't use it for most of the year anyway, so not a deal-breaker.",

            "comment": "From my friend's experience, the 1bd at 48 West doesn't suffer nearly as much from noise as the 4bd places on the property. You're up in the lofts above the businesses/office, away from all the townhomes and flats. Also, 48 is in the process of installing fiber internet, if that piques your interest as well.\n\nI lived in 48 for a few years so my biggest complaints are slow general maintenance response (lightbulbs) and the shoddy paint. Other than that, they usually work with you if you negotiate for a better lease deal, emergency maintenance, help with issues on the property.",

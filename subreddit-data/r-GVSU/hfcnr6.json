    "postText": "Holy fuck. A simple google search just revealed that Philomena gets paid $480,000 a year and is overseeing the dismantling of the school into a quasi-online for-profit model ala Bain Capital style restructuring. A reasonable salary for an executive would be $150,000. We could pay 3 Emeritus level Professors with the excess. What other executives are getting paid this excessively while we are seeing MOTHERFUCKING TUITION HIKES?! Meanwhile, they are forcing professors to take on increased course loads for what essentially amounts to executive profiteering?!!?   \n\n\nWe need to organize.  \n\n\nThe Professors need a union.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe students need a union.   \n\n\nDM me your info if you are down with the movement and want to organize!",

Many of the private college presidents are probably making a lot more than $480,000 too. Its comparable with what WMU and CMU are paying which seems about right to me.\n\nAt $150,000 you probably arent going to be able to attract the kind of person you need to run a school of this size.",

It might sound like a lot to you as an undergrad, but it\u2019s nowhere near high enough to attract the level of talent you need to handle the great responsibilities that come with the job.",

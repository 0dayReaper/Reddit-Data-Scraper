            "comment": "I lived in Murray on south campus freshman year and enjoyed it. Murray is the \u2018International House\u2019 although I was not an international student. \n\nCompared to the housing on North campus, south campus is much quieter and relaxed. I did miss out on some of the activities and socializing that happen on north campus. So, if you really want that college freshman experience where you are all jammed in a small space and you meet a lot of people, maybe the traditional freshman housing would be fine. \n\nOn the other hand, Murray is spacious and offers apartment style living. It consists of upperclassmen and most people mind their own business. You are also right across the street from The Connection which makes for some convenient meals. \n\nHope this helps!",

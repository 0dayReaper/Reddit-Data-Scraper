Between streamline routes (they don't go behind the fire station in Standale anymore) and the stations all being at level (meaning he bus doesn't need to drop down or rise up), it's much faster.  \n\nIt can still be longer during rush hour times, but still faster.  During the morning in summer it's can be as short as 15 minutes.\n\nThe biggest problem is still 5-5:30 going from Allendale to GR.  Between normal rush hour traffic and people leaving Allendale in cars the Standale corridor gets really backed up.",

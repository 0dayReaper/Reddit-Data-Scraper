    "postText": "I am currently one semester away from graduating and being a first generation college graduate! Soon I will be applying to entry level software engineering and software developer positions. My big concern however, is my GPA. Most entry level positions (the ones that pay good at least) want to see a high graduating GPA (Which is BS but that's for another day.) In the Winter of 2020 I was at a steady 3.1 GPA. Then I took CIS 351 and my GPA has gone to trash ever since as I have taken the course 3 times including one time this semester. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that being said, I failed the class once and lowered my GPA from 3.1 to a 2.9. This infuriates me because I clearly am not that stupid. Like I understand that since I failed the class I deserve what I get but it just isn't fair! I am however, looking to get somewhat of a B to an A in the class this time around (knock on wood). The second time I took the course I barely failed the class by .6 percent and lowered my GPA even more to a 2.73. What's pain stackingly wrong with this class is that the first two times I took it, everything had due dates, and the tests were not open note so studying hard was the only way to pass the course. Now that I am taking it a third time, the class is now open note on tests, and labs along with homework assignments are due at the end of the semester! See why I am frustrated? I pretty much took this class twice and had to endure hell but now its open note and so much easier! I feel like I was literally robbed of my own money, but I won't blame anyone since I think the professor realized the class is hard and made things a little easier for upcoming students. I just happened to not be able to pass until they changed the course syllabus rules. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here's the question, since I am retaking it and will likely get a higher grade, will this replace both F's that I received or just one? I am a little confused since usually retaking a course replaces the letter grade previously. How will this work since I have taken the course 3 times now? Will one of those F's have to stay on my transcript??",

This means that the first attempt is excluded and the second is included. GVSU always counts the most recent grade, no matter if it is higher or lower. You would have to do a Repeat Limit Form to take the class again. You can find that on the Registrar\u2019s Website, under the \u201cStudent Forms\u201d section of the Student drop down menu. You\u2019ll need your advisor\u2019s signature and the CIS department chair\u2019s signature.",

But I did look at my transcript and I do see the I and E on both of those attempts so thank you for the information! I will have to live with an F I guess forever.",

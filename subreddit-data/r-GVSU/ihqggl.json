We put the proper distancing floor markers in place and need Lakers to encourage each other to use them. We\u2019re happy to see the wide use of masks\u201d \n\nThis is such bullshit to me. You cannot put floor markers down and say \u201cokay, our job is done here, time for the students to step up and enforce the rules\u201d. The way Kleiner is set up, the way every dining hall is set up, the way the dorms and some classrooms are set up, makes social distancing IMPOSSIBLE if everyone is going to be inside. Of COURSE there\u2019s a lunch and dinner rush at Kleiner! That\u2019s where the freshmen know to go! \n\nJesus inconsolable weeping Christ I do not understand why this is so difficult for admin to comprehend.",

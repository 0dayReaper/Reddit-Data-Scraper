I signed up with GV's counseling center for an appointment tomorrow. I didn't find them to be very helpful. Does anyone have any good recommendations? (Ideally in Grand Rapids area)",

Not a professional, but had my boyfriend go through similar times and just having someone to listen to can help. I know there is a suicidal hotline too, but I am not too sure how good it is.",

Otherwise  there are other [Network180](https://www.network180.org/en/mental-illness/providers) providers that may be able to help. That's sorta their thing afaik.",

They accept a lot of insurances even Medicaid. If you feel like you need help immediately, I would recommend Pine Rest Urgent Care, as they\u2019ll be able to direct you in the right direction. Feel free to ask me any questions, I\u2019ve been there my friend. A year ago last week, I was admitted to Holland Hospital for almost killing myself. It\u2019s a hard process, but I\u2019m still here and am doing the best I have been in a very long time. May the pain ease soon",

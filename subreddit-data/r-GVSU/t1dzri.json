I genuinely found them to be about the same difficulty as undergrad classes, just more time consuming. At the end you can either do a thesis or a semester long project at the end. I'm doing the project. You pick your own to topic and basically work on it the whole semester, then during exam week you have to present it.",

Would you go here if you go here if you had acceptance from better universities? How do you feel about your job prospects come graduation time? My alternative option is to go to Germany for my MS.",

I did get accepted to better universities, but I already have relationships with a lot of my profs who have connections to good companies. I also have a job lined up at Deloitte in Chicago, so pretty good job prospects. I'd have to say that if you plan on working in the US, then it would make most sense to get your degree in the US.",

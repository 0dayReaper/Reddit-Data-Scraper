    "postText": "I use spotify a lot, but I've noticed the mobile version seems kinda buggy. It's very laggy, it sometimes takes around a minute to get from one song to the next, same goes for skipping songs. I have spotify premium, but it's difficult to use spotify on my phone when it does this. The reason I ask about it here is because it only ever does this when I'm on campus in Allendale. I've tried every fix I can find online for spotify lag, and nothing seems to work. Does anyone else have this problem or am I just going insane?",

If you check myScholarships you can see the status of the ones you submitted through there. Do not lose hope yet; a friend of mine got his notice about 2 weeks ago - quite late imo, but I have a feeling the rewarders are unmotivated because of corona too haha. I believe they honestly have until the school year starts up again - I have received financial aid as late as a month into the semester before.",

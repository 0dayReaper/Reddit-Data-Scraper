I am going to be going to the business college for both and their academics are pretty on par (especially bc I got into both honors colleges). WSU offers more diversity (which means a lot to me as a POC) but GVSU gave me full ride which is where the dilemma lies \ud83d\ude05 I\u2019ve heard great things about both schools but any additional info would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nEdit: Ty all sm for the feedback! I decided I\u2019d be going to GV in the fall :)",

Especially if your from a predominantly POC area like Detroit where u always have somewhere familiar to return to. There is a center on campus for POC but outside of that you wont see many others on campus and youll very often be the only POC in a class of 50, if u go to GV youll need to get used to that. I got accepted into both and was in a similar delima to you but i chose GV bc they have a better psych program, are more queer friendly, and i personally didnt care about being around other black ppl too much that it was a big factor in my choice. If you want to go to a culturally rich school with plenty to do in the surrounding area GV is NOT what your looking for!",

            "comment": "I'll be frank, you're not at all wrong with calling WSU more diverse, lol. I don't know what business class make-ups are, but I've looked around my major's classes sometimes and noticed how many other white people were looking back at me. \n\nHowever, I will say that while we lack a larger diverse population of students, that doesn't mean students of color aren't connecting with and supporting each other. Off the top of my head I remember going to campus life night (event where all the clubs and organizations show off and convince people to join) and there was a Black Excellence org &amp; Black Student Union, the Asian Student Union, I believe a Hispanic student org, as well as an org of professors of colors engaging with students (I think!). Obviously I can't know which organization would relate to you, but I'd suggest looking through the organization list on lakerlink.com--it should have all of them.\n\nMy main suggestion for favoring the full ride is this: while after college you'll most likely have plenty of opportunities to seek out diverse spaces and support, being able to pay off lots of student debt easily is less certain. Tbh not having student debt to worry about will make picking and choosing where you live less stressful. So I'd pick the full ride, personally.\n\nBut of course while four years is a short amount of time by some angles, it can be very, very long by others. If you think a whiter campus culture will genuinely make you unhappy and lonely, by all means, go WSU. It's a good school! But if you think you can get by and want an easier exit out into the workforce, I'd encourage the full ride.\n\nGood luck!",

However, it could be a positive experience to immerse yourself in a different culture and a college campus is a very safe space to do so.  Based on my experience, GVSU is a very welcoming and eager-to-learn culture (this coming from a straight, white male so take my opinion for what it's worth) when it comes to minorities.\n\nI've heard stories from fellow alumni that as a POC they were asked by professors or students to share a perspective as if they were supposed to represent their entire demographic. This is certainly problematic, but perhaps the alternative would be to disregard other perspectives entirely - which would be worse.\n\nI sure am biased, but I have a BBA from Grand Valley and it worked out pretty well for me.\n\nTruth be told, you can't go wrong either way.",

The lack of diversity is worse in the student clubs which influenced my decision to not get seriously involved in any groups. I hated the lack of diversity and would have selected a different school if I had a mulligan. \n\nI did well academically at GV and landed a great job out-of-state, so no major complaints there. If your expected 4-year debt is reasonable (less than $25k) WSU should be the way, as diversity would be the main factor \n\nhttps://www.gvsu.edu/inclusion/diversity-dashboard-128.htm",

I just graduated this past December so pretty fresh. Overall I would say yeah, but that is horseshit imo lol. Working 8 hours per day, most  connections thus far have been at work, which is typical for post-grad. I am thankful to work for a large corporation that has amazing diversity (something I really wanted/needed after Gvsu). I would say overall it\u2019ll depend on the city you live and your place of employment. \n\nA large part of College is forming meaningful connections. So I would ask you, living in a area lacking diversity, how well have done doing that thus far? You can absolutely do that at GVSU, but it is going to be in spaces that are predominantly white. If you haven\u2019t already, visit Seidman and walk around to see what the campus is like",

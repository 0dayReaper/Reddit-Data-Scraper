From what I\u2019ve heard from senators and non-senators alike, it\u2019s just a big social club with a bunch of do-nothings that call each other Senator, and with more drama to last them throughout an entire 4 year period of membership. Not to mention their cabinet is an absolute embarrassment and should not even hold the positions or titles they possess. It\u2019s for these reasons I would hate to run, be elected, and be associated with those people.",

(2016-2019) at that time, senate was aware we didn't have the best PR relationship with students but tried really hard to reach out to students and faculty. Since I left (2020 senate and 2021) it has gone to shit. Fighting with the administration, drama within the body, political affiliations effecting student advocacy, and pushing personal agendas. Just a bunch of self centered people acting like they are better then other people bc they are on senate. It's a shame. It went downhill fast after T.Haas left.",

That being said, the cabinet has often times skewed more right of center and created a lot of roadblocks or controversy to stop many liberal policies from being passed.   \nThis is one of the contributing factors to their absurdly high turn over rate.",

Or if someone is an RA vs a general resident. It's a social standing. Once I graduated and moved on from being on senate I was like dang that's an issue. I'm definitely not perfect, but trying to better myself. Now I study college and educational advocacy and policy in graduate school!",

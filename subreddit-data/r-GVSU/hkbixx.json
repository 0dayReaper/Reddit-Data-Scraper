    "postText": "Hello everybody,\n\nI hope you are holding up. You are, most likely, a quickly developing young adult in one of the most interesting times in recent history. Current events suggest that 'normalcy' is a bygone--but do not fret, normalcy is stagnancy and stagnancy is what causes your muscles to atrophy, you know, that magic process that makes the skin get all wrinkly and that which fuels the $50.2 billion anti-aging market.\n\nAll that racket aside, I want to provide you with some information (duh, that's what my click bait advertises).\n\nI was pissed last semester, my last as a student. GVSU administrators put on air their complete loyalty to the currents with a lackluster response:\n\n* They kicked students out of their homes.\n* Demanded faculty transition to online formats.\n* Demanded students transition to online formats.\n* Offered *zero* refunds on tuition.\n* Let go of 'obsolete' faculty (and the honorable Office of Fellowships).\n* Probably a lot of other things that I did not first hand see, (if you want to add something to the list, just shout).\n\nAnd it seems that this coming semester will not see improvements nor accountability. But we are smart enough to expect nothing more from administrators who are more concerned with their reputation and their money than the concerns of the student body and faculty/staff.\n\nI tried to get into contact with said administration, particularly after I found [President Mantella's ruminations](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-04-15-how-a-new-college-president-views-the-covid-19-crisis) during the initial onslaught of the virus acutely insensitive, but honest:\n\n\"Any planned pace of change we thought we needed for acceptance and viability within our institutions has been completely upended.\"\n\n\"move from . . . \\[a\\] delivery of education to . . . online learning, virtual experience and forms of hybrid learning . . . essential . . . for . . . community and connection.\"\n\n\"the deep obligation as educators to create prosperity on the other side of this virus\"\n\nAnd lastly, Dr. Suzeanne Benet (PhD in marketing/Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs) wrote me saying, do not fret,\n\n\"If GVSU offers more online classes in the future, this will in no way impact the commitment to a liberal education.\u00a0 In fact, if we went fully online we could still be committed to a liberal education.\u00a0 However, we do not have any intention of becoming an online institution.\"\n\nAnd when asked, \"why no refunds?\", she responded,\n\n\"Students are able to earn the credits they registered for, so they can move forward in their programs.\u00a0 Since they did not sign up for online or hybrid classes, we did not charge the normal fee attached to those formats.\u00a0 (Online classes are more expensive for us to offer.)\"\n\nWhich amounts to saying, we are doing the Good Work by not charging you *extra* for the online classes, and just because you get what you did not sign up for it would be wrong *to demand you pay more for what you did not want.*\n\nI write this in response to the many posts populating this sub currently--the concerns about lackluster leadership at GV. I am deeply sympathetic to these concerns, particularly the ones about the town halls being a bunch of 'PR ladeedaa look at us' bullshit. Please fight for your rights as students. It will be the most important thing you can do, especially if you stand for furthering education and enjoy knowledge. You have an ally in me, and many other almuni, and perhaps to your surprise, many faculty and staff members.  While it may seem at times that we are powerless and necessarily subject to the whims of the administration, they depend upon their student body for everything they do. Organize.\n\nThe student senate showed their true colors after they promptly reinstated the, Lord grant me the courage, Pledge of Allegiance.",

If it was democratically decided upon to stop saying it, then promptly reinstated after public pressure, it is clear the senate is um incapable of \u2018acting as a union\u2019 as another redditor was suggesting to somebody concerned about the student body.\n\nFeel free to drop a link to something the student senate has done recently that was not trivial and walked back, that actually protected the student body.\n\nIn fact, if you found President Mantella\u2019s Edsurge article rather hasty and uncalled for, the Student Senate [recently tweeted their blind support.](https://mobile.twitter.com/GVStudentSenate/status/1250868508780609538)",

The students participating in a workshop hosted by her and other administrators found that Aramark is parasitic on the Grand Valley community. Mantella said, \"well we can cancel that contract then.\" Students got excited, and that was the end of it. Aramark is still the food distributor for GV. Students wanted to create a student run co-op.\n\nI will happily tell anyone applying to GV to look elsewhere. That university is in the pits. Faculty are not happy there, students are not happy there and campus life seems grossly artificial. I only got my degree from GV because I did not want to transfer in my junior/senior years, right around when Michigan went free tuition for low income students.",

There is fear of state funding being slashed. If a student doesn\u2019t want to pay the tuition, then they have the choice not to. Life isn\u2019t fair right now and no decision making will be perfect. That needs to be grasped.",

You are right, and I hear you, they\u2019d rather accommodate a more financially robust student body, or rather a student body that can shoulder unjustified financial burdens during a global economic collapse. \n\nAll because they are more worried about growth than sustenance. \n\nBe sure you are informed of what exactly it is I am saying. Surely, you are right, life is not fair. But it is unfortunately remarkably unfair to particular individuals, and that absolutely goes without saying. And their situation is not their fault, it is the result of inappropriate behaviors that create impersonal structural systems that are not designed to weather the unexpected or make space for the underprivileged. \n\nWe are trying to imagine being more active in determining the future by reflecting on past events.",

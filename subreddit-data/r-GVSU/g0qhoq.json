    "postText": "Hi, I'm thinking of changing my major from BMS to Comp Sci and I am an incoming sophomore. I want to get the pre-admit courses done and have the background to apply for internships as soon as possible. I would easily be able to catch up an graduate in 4 years if I take CIS 162 over the summer. \n\nI can't afford to do it at GV, and WCC offers it online. I already got a course to override approved for CIS 163 but although he said the course seems to be a better alternative than some other courses that transfer, he still said to consider taking it in the fall. \n\nI would be fine with holding off graduation, but if I do, I lose my scholarships which would be a big problem.\n\nDo any of you think I would be okay taking 162 over the summer or am I setting myself up for failure?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I suppose it depends on how well of a foundation the transfer classes teaches you for Java. CIS 163 is arguably much harder than CIS 162, however if you have a decent understanding of Java and object oriented programming, then you'll likely be fine. You may have a bit of catching up to do for the first project, but then you will hopefully have your head around it. Many of the things you learn and program in 163 build on the foundation you learned during 162.",

            "comment": "It might be easier to take 162 and 163 during fall/winter semesters, and use spring/summer to catch up on other courses between your sophomore and junior year. Unless that was already your plan, of course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have a baseline of understanding of Java &amp; OOP, summer 162 would be reasonable.",

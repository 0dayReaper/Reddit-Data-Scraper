            "comment": "I am currently a Junior in the honors college here at GV. I did the scholarship competition when I was a high school senior! From what I can remember, It was pretty simple. There is an essay portion and an interview portion (not sure how they are doing things with covid). For the essay, they gave us some prompts to choose from and we had a set amount of time to write. For the interview part, it was an individual meeting with 2 faculty members. They asked questions about my interests, career goals, future plans, etc. I thought it was a pretty easy day and well worth it. The scholarships you receive carry on through your 4 years in undergrad as long as you meet the GPA requirements! Feel free to message me with any questions!",

I did it on a whim my senior year of high school, not expecting to be interested in GV, and they offered me nearly a full ride. I ended up getting my undergrad there because the scholarship offer was so much better than I was getting anywhere else. It's a great place to get a degree if you're not paying much for it.",

I\u2019m unsure how comfortable you feel sharing your SAT/ACT results over the Internet, but i\u2019m genuinely curious what your scores were. I\u2019m unsure what they typically use to determine who gets what scholarship (whether that\u2019s test scores, sports, extracurriculars, etc).",

I don't remember my ACT score exactly, but I think it was a 31 or 32. I checked SAT and it was 2100 by the old score style or approximately 1380-1470 by the new style. These tests can be a crucial part of getting in the door for admissions and/or scholarships at any school (or at least they were when I applied), and I took them multiple times to practice and improve.   \n\nIn the long run, of course, these tests matter much less than the experiences you had and the skills you developed. I didn't remember my scores, but I still remember all of the things I participated in during high school. If you have to meet a score threshold, though, it's important to be there. Let me know if I can give any more advice!",

    "postText": "I ordered a MacBook from the Laker store and live only 15 mins away from campus. I have tried to contact the school multiple times via phone and email and have not received any word back. I was contacting them to see if I could safely pick it up at the campus. Does anyone know if people are working on campus still? I understand essential staff may be but no-one has answered my messages. \n\nThanks!",

I was a student worker in their marketing department before graduation and we tried to maintain a high response rate on all our social media platforms. This'll probably be your best bet since the store hours that staff are there are irregular right now so we might not have people around to take a call. \n\nIf that doesn't work, shoot me a DM and I'll get in contact with my old manager to see how we can help you.",

Also most of the offices are probably closed during the break but hopefully someone can get back to you when the spring semester starts!",

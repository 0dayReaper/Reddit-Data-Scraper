Sounds like she was a freshman based on her age, and this early into the school year the desire to make friends is so, so strong. I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't expect the lake temps (not having a history of swimming it sounds like) or the undertow, and it was dark, but went in when all her friends did (who likely encouraged her to join in!). And of course things went terribly wrong. But it sounds like her friends freaked out, and still called the police immediately, and made some other dumb decisions right after like with the phone and the GoFundMe, but shit, they're 18 olds!? It just doesn't make sense for it to be a literal murder.",

There's barely enough room for one person to put their stuff in the pantry and other cabinets. Me and my roommate aren't even sure how we are going to fit our sliverware and other kitchen supplies together. Laker Village gives you a perfect amount of space. I never had to worry about running into my roommates stuff or taking up too much space.",

We will set a hard border between us and you, shifting our logo leftwards and repairing your 403 if you can assist us in keeping out these r/GVSU folk. They can move their logo elsewhere that isn't on top of two others. Our very simple [KOM](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/428268773334843412/960335975203090512/unknown.png) lettering (which we will add detail to when it's finished) should fit neatly to your left without interfering.",

We got in contact with the [pumpkin folks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/428268773334843412/960363161347842099/unknown.png) to our left, and they'll gladly make space if we help them move theirs. Any help would be appreciated. If it's enough space, there might be room for you to add any extra pixel art or fancier borders in the gap.",

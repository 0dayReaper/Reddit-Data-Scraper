I highly regard the GVSU Summer Courses as being a great option to get ahead in your courses / help balance your F / W semesters.   \n\n\nI took both Undergrad and grad summer classes (6 and 12 week variants).   \n\n\nFor six-week classes, I found them to be a lot of work, but easier than a traditional 12-14 week class, and to receive the same credits it was a no-brainer for me.   \n\n\nBe careful of taking though a six-week class that traditionally would be a challenging for you.  For example, I took a graduate level coding class with ZERO pre-req knowledge, and found myself struggling quite a bit, and required A LOT of work.  \n\n\nOther than that, loved them, helped me take only 4 classes during the Winter and Fall, and kept me engaged in my learning year round. Letting me graduate in 4 years and receive the grand finish Scholarship.   \n\n\nGL with your studies!",

Summer classes are fast paced and great for people that don\u2019t need a lot of time to learn new concepts and are willing to put the work in.\n\nThe worse class I took at GVSU was accounting and honestly, I may have failed it during a traditional semester because I would have forgotten that stuff. Having it a 6 week time made it easier to retain the info.\n\nA lot of people I knew took the computer requirement where you learn Word, Excel, Power Point, Publisher, and ACCESS in the summer too because it was a lot of busy work. If you have like 6 hours to sit down you can knock that stuff out!",

I would have to spend every night after work just doing homework which sucks in the summer when the weather is nice and you want to go do stuff. Overall was worth it though bc it allowed me to graduate on time.",

            "comment": "Faculty member here who's taught courses in the summer. First, there are two terms in the summer: \"Spring\" term which runs May-June and \"Summer\" term which goes July-August, each term being 6 weeks long. Some courses run through both terms, on a 12-week schedule. I've taught both the 6- and 12-week varieties. \n\nSix-week courses are *fast*. You're taking a 15-week course and fitting the same course into a schedule less than half that length. So while the pace of the class *during* the class is the same (the prof isn't teaching at 2x speed), there is a lot less time in between class meetings. A three-credit class that normally meets Monday/Wednesday/Friday for 50 minutes each day, would run every day Monday-Thursday for 90 minutes at a time. To put that in perspective, a week of class in Spring term is 360 minutes of class time, which is over two week's worth of class meetings in Fall or Winter. And you should still expect to devote the same ratio of time outside class to time inside class on homework, labs, projects, etc. If you blink, or choose to skip a class meeting one day, then you might be screwed. \n\nOn the other hand, many of my students say they *prefer* that kind of pace because it forces them to focus and not procrastinate. I think they have a point -- you literally cannot procrastinate if there is no time available to waste. And I've seen students who struggle with a longer time scale, really thrive when the pace gets picked up. \n\nCourses on the 12-week Spring+Summer schedule are much easier to deal with since in my view 12 weeks is only a little faster than 15 weeks. Many of the 4- and 5-credit courses we offer in the summer, run on this 12 week combined schedule. \n\nOn either schedule, be careful not to overload yourself. I highly recommend not taking more than two courses at a time if you are doing anything on the 6-week schedule, and make that one class if you have a work schedule on top of it. A lot of my students underestimated the pace of a 6-week class and had four courses scheduled plus 20+ hours of work, and they burned out fast. \n\nOne nice thing about spring/summer courses is that the class sizes are often smaller, and it's more of a relaxed vibe. And there tends to be much more variety in terms of mode (online, hybrid, face-to-face) in the spring and summer, if you need more choices.",

For example, I had a graphic design 1 class I had to take and it wasn't super challenging as I knew a lot about it already. Maybe try that route as the courses can be a lot of work since they are trimmed down time wise.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m a first generation college student (sophomore) and the whole internship ordeal gets to be confusing. I\u2019ve attended a recruiting meeting with PWC and plan on following up with them later in my academic career. In the meantime, I would like to get an internship over the summer as I will have studied more accounting by then. I plan on attending the spring career fair and will keep an eye on handshake, but would anyone have any suggestions about how to go about getting an internship this summer? I\u2019ll be living in Allendale all summer long.",

I\u2019m not too concerned about missing out on an internship in my sophomore year as I transferred from a community college and just want to get a feel for the university life. I also don\u2019t want to wait until I\u2019m almost ready to graduate and don\u2019t have any experience/connections, so I plan to attend the accounting/networking events. Thanks again!",

            "comment": "Handshake is your best friend for finding an internship and getting connected with all of the firms that are hiring. Contact someone in the career office for a meeting to help with your handshake profile, resume, etc. like Mr. Duckmeat said, these firms have already filled their internships for the year. Prepare for the spring or fall recruiting period and sign up for as many one-on-one events with recruiters as possible. Recruiters are the ones that help push you forward to interviews, so make sure to make a good impression and attend all of the events they offer. \n\nThe most effective internship is a full time internship in the winter semester. Take the time off from school and fully commit to it, it pays well too. The winter is busy season and will provide you with a lot more work and give you a feel for public accounting. Decide if you\u2019re looking for big 4, mid-size firms, or local firms (almost all 1040 tax returns for local, it would be really boring).\n\nIt\u2019s a competitive process and you should come prepared to meetings/interviews with knowledge of the industry, why you would be good in public accounting, and whether you want to go into tax or audit. \n\nI just went through the process in the fall and ended up landing a job offer at my number one choice, instead of an internship, when I graduate. If you have questions, let me know. Happy to help.",

            "comment": "Major firms (EY, PWC, KPMG, Deloitte) and regional firms (Plante Moran, BDO, etc) have already finished recruiting for next summer.  Your best bet is probably an accounting internship on the industry side (aka not at an accounting firm)...but most major companies have already filled their roles for next summer too. \n\nIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re looking at this as a sophomore.  Make sure you nail the timing on recruiting for summer 2022! \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d find a random summer job by campus, take a few summer classes to ease up your senior year burden, and plan on securing B4 internships for summer 2022 and during your senior year.",

I plan on applying and hope to get it, but if not that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll keep in touch with PWC and other firms that I may come across. I definitely plan on attending the career fairs as well.

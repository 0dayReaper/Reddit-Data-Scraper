    "postText": "Hello. I signed a lease at Campus View with some friends, but circumstances changed and now I won't be here for the year. Still, I'd like to fill the room somehow. The lease is 500$ but I'd be willing to cut someone a discount. The best fit would be someone more on the studious side of things but anyone who can work with roommates and figure things out is welcome.",

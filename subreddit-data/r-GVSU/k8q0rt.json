    "postText": "Hi guys! my roommates and I are looking at a 5 person house for rent next year in Grand Rapids, I\u2019m wondering 1. How many people live with you and 2. How much your utilities are per person, I understand this may be private information to share and totally understand if you don\u2019t wish to share or would feel better private messaging me, we\u2019re just unsure what the average utilities are in grand rapids. We\u2019re looking in the northwest west area of GR. Thank you!",

There is some type of law against it but landlords work around it. Mainly all that matters is that their isn\u2019t 5 names on the lease. If you know your roommates well enough, that shouldn\u2019t be an issue",

The utilities can be costly because you pay for a lot more compared to the apartments in allendale. We each pay $10 for trash every other month, 40 for water every 3 months, 25 for consumers, around 5 for DTE and 15 for internet. Highly recommend living downtown!",

    "postText": "Hi I seen the MOV 304 course was full for this summer and I was wondering if anyone didn\u2019t need the class and was going to drop anyways or if anyone taking the course doesn\u2019t need to take it.\n\nI really need to take the class this summer, but if I have to wait until fall it\u2019s not a huge deal. However, if someone would be willing to drop it I\u2019d be happy to pay them $100 or so for allowing me in their seat.\n\nThank you for your time everyone, and goodluck on finals!",

Or even one person so I am position #1 on the waitlist.\n\nLike I said, I\u2019m okay with waiting a semester, but it will put me behind a semester or two. I\u2019m only offering an incentive for anyone who can wait until fall to take the class or don\u2019t need the class for their major.",

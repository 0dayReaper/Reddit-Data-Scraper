I liked Marvel movies, so I went to a handful of Comic Book Club meetings. We went to movie premieres, reviewed comics together, and even went to Chicago for a comic con! \n\n*Whatever your major is, ask a prof about a student run organization. \n\n*COVID stinks...but I hung out at the pool tables looking for someone to play pool with. A lot of natural conversations started there. Sporting events like football games were always a blast. \n\nI hope that helps you!",

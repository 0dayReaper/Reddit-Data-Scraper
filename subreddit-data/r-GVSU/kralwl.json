There are quite a few small businesses, stores, etc. within driving distance of the allendale campus, and I was curious if I should look for jobs out there instead. I know the jobs on campus, especially in dining, have small benefits, but other places offer more money per hour. Let me know what you guys think!",

She never liked me and I never got why anyways\n\nI've heard nothing but great things working in the it or library areas. I wish I did that no idea why I raked up so much experience in fast food\n\nAlso some experiences/anecdotes just off campus\n\n- mennas joint was run like shit but the most fun. Think it's closed now lol\n\n- peppinos was great. Until a lawsuit came out because of how they were writing up hours. I believe it has new management now \n\n- main st was great. No complaints there. Bus access is clutch \n\n- heard the McDonald's is terrible to work at\n\n- heard the Meijer is great to work at from 3 people and you can bus there.\n\n- liquor stores are hit or miss according to the workers at them\n\n- j and h gas station is great\n\n- speedway is terrible\n\nEverything's anecdotal but from many people.",

The Connection was a good place to work at overall through. Easy jobs all around and the schedule is flexible. I worked mornings to avoid the dinner and lunch rushes.",

It can be essays, fiction stories, poetry, personal writing, a letter to your grandma, it really doesn't matter; if it's writing, we work with it. We mainly work with essays, though, for obvious reasons.   \nWe also work with writing in any stage of the writing process, meaning every step from \"I've just received this prompt and I need help understanding it\" to \"my essay is written, I just need you to check for grammar and accuracy in my citations\". It's a very collaborative process. We don't \"fix\" people's writing for them, but we engage in a conversation with them to help them brainstorm and figure out ways to develop their work on their own. It's really fulfilling, and you get to see a wide range of student writing in the process! (If you're curious, we do this over Google Meet at the moment because of COVID. During the pandemic, you'll have to have a reasonably stable internet connection to be a consultant.)   \nWe also work in intro writing classrooms (WRT 120, WRT 130, and WRT 150) to provide more tailored support to classes. It's a great way to get to know the students and their needs better, and it's also a great way to get to know some Writing faculty pretty well.   \nBasically, if you like writing and talking to people and you're decently good at both, it's a great job and I'd highly recommend looking into it more! Here's the page on the WC's website if you'd like to look into it more:   \n[https://www.gvsu.edu/wc/apply-to-be-a-writing-consultant-141.htm](https://www.gvsu.edu/wc/apply-to-be-a-writing-consultant-141.htm)  \nLet me know if you have more questions! I'll try to not take 19 days to get back to you this time, lol.",

I never felt nervous about walking back to my dorm at 1 in the morning. The only thing is that you cannot request days off, you have to get someone to cover your shift. Working on campus also means getting the lowest pay wage they can give you. It really depends on what you're looking for in the job. :)  I got extra meals for working so many hours though so that was a nice plus.",

I used to work for Best Buy and it was pretty eye opening what was going on was not unique to just my store. Also this time of year tends to be very slow in retail so be aware. I don\u2019t know if target does this. But when I worked at Best Buy if I do not get enough credit cards or memberships compared to the rest of my team my hours went down significantly. Do your research and if you know people that work at places that you want to work out definitely ask them as well",

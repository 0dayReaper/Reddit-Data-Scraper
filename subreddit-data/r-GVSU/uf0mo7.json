Also, the internship \u201cclass\u201d for me was just logging what I did at work. 0 interaction with the class. It\u2019s a blatant scam.",

Also, I\u2019m not sure if they run it during the Spring/Summer but in the other semesters the Career Center has a scholarship for those completing unpaid internships.\n\nUPDATE: Career Center has two scholarships available for students completing a for credit , unpaid internship. Deadline is May 16, 2022. www.gvsu.edu/careers/award",

I didn't learn anything, they pawned me off on the township to do some event things and when I had to write my paper for credit I talked about my real job more. So ridiculous I had to pay GV for this useless experience.",

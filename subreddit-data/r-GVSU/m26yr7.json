I'm referring to general admission to the art program. Any past or current  students who can help me out would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: I've already completed half of the foundation courses and are in the process of completing the rest",

Also he sent out an email recently mentioning that there will be a zoom information session for the studio art major March 25 from 5-6 which I would recommend joining. I\u2019m a graphics emphasis so I don\u2019t know too much about other programs but if you have any other questions I may be able to help!",

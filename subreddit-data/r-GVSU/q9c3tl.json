    "postText": "I've seen several posts from people looking for friends or connections at GVSU, so I thought I'd share this information (if you post a question below, I'll try to post more specific ideas):\n\n**Office of Student Life** for clubs, Greek life, leadership and civic opportunities, alternative spring break, etc. There are LOTS of clubs and groups with all kinds of different interests: [https://www.gvsu.edu/studentlife/](https://www.gvsu.edu/studentlife/) (you might need to log in to \"LakerLink\").\n\n**Campus Recreation**: intramural sports, club sports, exercise classes, pick-up games, and more: [https://www.gvsu.edu/rec/](https://www.gvsu.edu/rec/)\n\n**Your major**: is there a profession group? a social group? Lots of majors have their own club or association.\n\nCheck the **billboards in the halls** of certain buildings, you'll find different events/opportunities where you can meet people.\n\nAlso, depending on how you identify and your interests, there is the **Office of Multicultural Affairs, LGBT Center, Center of Women and Gender Equity, Kauffman Interfaith Institute,** and those are open to folks who want to be allies as well: [https://www.gvsu.edu/inclusion/division-offices-and-partnerships-53.htm](https://www.gvsu.edu/inclusion/division-offices-and-partnerships-53.htm)\n\nWe also have a **Veteran's Network** at GVSU: [https://www.gvsu.edu/veterans/](https://www.gvsu.edu/veterans/)",

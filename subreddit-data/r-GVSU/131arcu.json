The problem is, you need to be signing by at least October of the previous year. I've been looking for a studio or one bedroom for at least a month and a half, and everything within that budget is taken for next year, around Allendale, GR, and every other surrounding area. There's always sublets, but those get snatched up quick unless you're on FB 24/7. But unless you qualify for low income housing, you're kinda out of luck unless you get roommates.",

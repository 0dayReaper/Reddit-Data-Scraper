    "postText": "I just got an email that was an invitation to join alpha phi sigma, or the criminal justice honors society. It's a 70 dollar one time fee, which is a pretty decent price, however this is my last year of college so I don't know if joining is actually going to be worth the money and time. People who have been in it, I have a few questions:  \n1. What kind of \"organizing events\" or going to events were there? Was there a variety, or was it just focused on one aspect of criminal justice? And how frequent was it?  \n2. Were you able to make any connections with people in the criminal justice career that could help forward/actually forwarded your career?  \n3. Overall, was it worth it?  \nPretty much any information would be appreciated, thanks!",

They make the recipient feel good with \u201cacceptance\u201d into their organization, then they charge you what seems like a low cost up front and then move on to the next person who will give them money. \n\nYour biggest benefit is that you can slap the name on a resume and hope someone doesn\u2019t realize the low standards for the organization and decides it makes you sound better.",

    "postText": "This is quite obvious to people who already go here. For the transfer/new students snooping around: Our bus system is fantastic. It gives you access to several places on the bus route to Standale and downtown GR (Route 50, if I'm remembering correctly). They're usually hiring and will give you better pay/benefits than CD will. I can attest to McDonalds and Meijers working well with students. They will assure you work within the limits of your schedule. As of 2022, CD is still paying the average student worker minimum wage with the same lackluster benefits. You can do better. Value your labor and your time.\n\nEdit: Lakerline has replaced Route 50!",

And I got permission to do so while we're at it. When she got confirmation that I indeed was given permission, she more or less told me to fuck off with no apology whatsoever. I learned an important lesson that day.",

If you really look for jobs, there are many cool little gigs who are always hiring. Throughout mine and my girlfriend's GVSU career we've delivered cars for dealerships, acted as a party planner for a lady in East GR, taught music lessons for a local shop, hung christmas lights, and worked at a radio station.",

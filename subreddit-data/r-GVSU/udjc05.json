    "postText": "I currently have an apartment lease with my girlfriend at Trio South (4 bed, 4.5 bath) with a rent totaling out at approximately $540 per month. Our official lease begins in June for a full 12 month lease, however if you're going home for the summer we can cover the cost until you move in, or if you possibly already have a lease that won't start until August and are looking for a place on campus from June until then that would also give us some help! We have a potential 3rd lined up but its still not definitive, so if we can lock in 2 definitive signers you've got the spot.\n\nProfiles regarding my girlfriend and myself:\n\nI'm 21 years old and a Junior double majoring in psychology and philosophy. I also work part time 2nd and 3rd shift at Pine Rest residential behavioural homes. In my free time I play PC and Switch, and I'm big into speedrunning and emulation. I hope to go to the gym a couple times a week to stay in shape. I'm not a huge go out to a party kind of guy, especially with Covid the last couple years, but I'm not opposed to a tight knit social gathering to drink and play party games.\n\nMy girlfirend is also 21 years old, and will be taking her 2nd year at GRCC as an art major. She works part time at Petco in the morings or afternoons. She loves to sketch and paint when she gets the opportunity, and enjoys comfy games like Animal Crossing or the Sims. She is largely the same regarding partying, not opposed to drinking, but not a fan of HUGE social gatherings.\n\nWe have a 1 year old Australian Shepherd Puppy, who is extremely cuddly and playful, as well as a rescue cat (not sure how old) who is equally as friendly and curious.\n\nIf you're interested send me a DM and I'll make sure to keep notifications on my phone. We would like to meet up first to discuss and get to know one another to see if we would all make a good fit :)",

Not as many people in the Midwest are going to know GVSU, let alone outside the Midwest.  UofM is a nationally ranked school.",

Upper Division classes will be comparably small and you'll have access to much better research opportunities at UofM. My first degree was from a big ranked University and it was a much better experience, albeit more challenging, than GVSU. If you want to move to another part of the country people will not say \"GVS-WHO?\" and the dating pool and quality of life will be much better at UofM. This is a no brainer.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here, but I was in your exact situation a few years ago (graduate in two weeks). I visited UofM when I was looking at colleges and initially really liked it. Maybe just because it was such a change compared to high school, but I really thought I might like it. I ended up visiting grand valley as well, and really loved the atmosphere there. I ended up deciding to go to GV mostly for cost reasons. It was just so hard to justify spending so much more for a school, when you can go to GV for very very little. I figured GV would be fine, but I didn\u2019t expect to really love it. One of the things that is most apparent is just how truly friendly everyone at GV is (especially the honors college). Everybody has the overly-polite, helpful Midwest mindset where they treat you kindly. Everyone holds the door for everyone, people are just nice. I had a friend who did the opposite, went to UofM as a pre-med student. He was a brilliant guy, getting a 35 ACT and being our salutatorian, but at UofM he said he felt like just another number there. At GV your classmates are always happy to help you whenever you\u2019re stuck with assignments, but he talked about how at UofM people would actively give other students wrong answers, just so they would seem better by comparison. On top of that, he just said that everyone seems somewhat depressed there. For me at least, I\u2019m happy I made the decision for GV. In general, especially in your later few years of college I feel like class sizes are smaller and you can really get individualized attention. I\u2019m friends with plenty of my professors, who really are great people, and are more than willing to go above and beyond to help you. While I won\u2019t say it\u2019s perfect (winters are pretty brutal) I was happy I made the choice I did.",

College is really what you make of it so if you wanna be smart with your money and be able to have more experiences that arent as competitive as umich, then GV is a great option. Honors college is alright tbh. The students are great, so helpful to each other and super nice. In my experience the advisors and some profs arent the most helpful. The curriculum helps get gen eds done quickly and in a more interesting way. You get to focus on one class with 24 other students for the full year and it get almost all gen eds done. The apartments at niemeyer are super nice and though can be isolating a bit, you just gotta make an effort to meet people and you will!",

Also, sticking with the same group of people through honors is an amazing way to make friends, I definitely got a cohort vibe with honors that I loved. Also have to second the honors apartments being really nice. From what I\u2019ve seen about the best you can get for on campus housing.",

Pros of the honors program: you don\u2019t take gen eds per say and the honors first year curriculum is pretty interesting. I was also able to graduate from GV in 3 years vs 4 likely due to the honors program and my AP credits. \nI was paying for college so GV was my cheaper option, well for schools that I liked the campus. \n\nI would disagree with those that have said go to U of M because it can get you into a grad program if that\u2019s your path. I\u2019m in a clinical doctorate program and I actually go to Ohio State now. I didn\u2019t pay for my 1st year of my doctorate (and I won\u2019t pay for my 3rd). Grand Valley is a great school and it still made me a competitive applicant for grad school. Also I think compared to my now classmates who went to OSU for undergrad I got a better education because of the smaller class sizes and better relationships with professors!",

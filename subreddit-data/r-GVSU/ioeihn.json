    "postText": "I know that this will probably be locked, although this sub is not nearly busy enough to have all of the covid talk in one sticky thread, but I\u2019ve heard rumblings that professors were alerted that classes will be moving online. A friend sent me a video of his professor talking over a zoom meeting today (I know it\u2019s labor day but he\u2019s working on his masters and was talking to his professor) that GV has alerted the faculty to this change. Not sure when or even if it\u2019ll actually happen, as always take anything you hear about this with a grain of salt. I\u2019m interested to see what the covid dashboard will look like when it finally updates again (last update was friday september 4 at 5pm).",

This doesn't mean OP is wrong, because I'm often the last person to hear things and nobody consults me on this stuff. However, there's been zero indication from my email and various Slack workspaces that this change is imminent. And I would have heard about it, I think, since I've been emailing my department chair today about a related issue and she had ample opportunity to tell me something like \"Just between you and me, don't worry about it because we're going online in a matter of days\" or something. \n\nMaybe the prof mentioned by OP knows something I don't? It wouldn't be a shock if that were the case LOL.",

Everything being posted on that is purely conjecture.  \n\nAs far as I can say, teaching two face-to-face classes last week MWF I was heartened to see the responsible approach all students are taking to being in class and on-campus.  I would like to thank you all for being serious in your efforts to help us tackle this as a community.",

Let people talk about the different aspects of this in different threads. The majority of the people want it this way anyways. There will be more threads on covid than other things due to the higher interest in it. Let people use the subreddit how they please and don't remove our talks and lock them up",

    "postText": "I am going to be a senior this upcoming year at GV and was looking at possibly getting a job on campus. I was looking on handshake for anything that fits my needs and I didn\u2019t really find anything but my friend told me about possibly becoming a tutor. \n\nI\u2019m a CS student so I was looking at possibly tutoring in the CIS drop in center located in MAK. If I do decide to go this route is there a process I need to undergo to become one? I did manage to pull a B+ in the beginner courses CIS 162 and a B in CIS 163. I went online and found the page that talks about the tutor application process but it\u2019s only for MTH, STA, and CHM classes and tells me to contact the coordinator for the respective center. \n\nI just need to know if I get paid while tutoring. If not I definitely still would like to become a tutor since this would look really good on a resume. If you were a CIS tutor before, what were the steps you needed to compete to become one?",

As a tutor/lab supervisor in the EGR department I asked the professors in the college to work as a tutor, and basically worked for them, but I was employed by the tutoring center. If there's something open for you, you'll definitely get paid. My title as a tutor for the low level engineering courses was \"Advanced Resources Tutor\". I think I got paid around $12/hr back in 2017.",

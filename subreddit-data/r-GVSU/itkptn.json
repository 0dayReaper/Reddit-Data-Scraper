    "postText": "So I know that on the computers in the library all seem to have the full Adobe studio on them. Because of Covid and campus being at reduced capacity (including the library), is there any way to get the Adobe suite through the school? I looked it up and the only info was how to register a license from like 2017.",

As someone else mentioned, Gvsu will only provide acrobat if a course requires it. Campus IT is exploring alternative, free, solutions.",

You should also be able to use the login information at the lab computers.\n\nThe one caveat is if you already have an Adobe account with your GVSU email AND you're currently paying for a CC subscription on that account, you do not get it for free.",

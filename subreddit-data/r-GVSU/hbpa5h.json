    "postText": "I feel that these meetings are far more focused on marketing and generating positive PR than providing students with relevant information about plans for the fall. What has been announced like floor markings and increased cleaning are to be expected and frankly the bare minimum. Students at other schools already know if their classes are online/hybrid while we're still left in the dark.\n\nIt feels like GV is waiting until the last minute to makes these announcements so we don't have as much time to weigh our options.\n\nI hoped that GV would have provided us with more information by now.",

I feel like they just keep repeating the same thing over and OVER again without providing any concrete decisions or advice. \n\nI also am slightly offended by the apparent ease with which the administration glosses over such important issues - like dorm rooms - an outbreak will happen in the dorms. Period. Philomena mentioned that the floor could go on lock down. Okay, well what happens with the students who are sick? Who aren\u2019t sick? With their classes? How do they get food? College life, but dorm life in particular, necessitates you are in close contact with other people - will there be a contact tracing system? \nOn top of all of that, how the f*ck is campus dining going to work? \n\nAs a closing note, I found it comical that one of the people on tonight\u2019s panel said they were going to \u201cwrap chairs in plastic wrap\u201d. Seriously? That\u2019s the length we\u2019re going to? Just make everything online for gods sake.",

Everyone has been cooped up for months, and not to mention school abruptly ended in March. Everyone is missing their friends. As soon as we\u2019re all back at school, the parties are going to be crazy. \n\nWhat can the admin even do about that? Police the off campus apartments like a militarized zone? None of this seems realistic to me.",

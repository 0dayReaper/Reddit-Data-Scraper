    "postText": "I am a 2019 graduate from GVSU who got my B.S in Global Studies and Social Impact. My plan was to apply it to a HR career path but it doesn't seem to be working out in my favor. It was such a new program that I think people just aren't really sure what it entails. \n\nThat being said, I am curious about what jobs people are getting with this major after graduation?",

These majors are either in CLAS or Brook's College (Interdisciplinary Studies) correct?\n\nIf so, those are not the degrees to go \"look what I got, can I work now?\"...they aren't STEM/industrial degrees.  These degrees are based on your skill-sets and internship/work experience.  You want to emphasize the skills you bring to the table, and the experiences that you have that demonstrate you have those skills.  The CLAS, and Brook's College majors in particular put a huge emphasis on co-curriculum and community involvement, which is where you gain that experience or examples you use in interviews to demonstrate you have the skills for the job you're applying for.\n\nIn terms of your resume, you want to spotlight your skillets at the top.  In your cover letters, you want to emphasize the experience you have the confirms the skills.\n\nI highly advise going to the Career Center!  They help alumni too!",

This is info they can give you, and they\u2019re there to help alumni as much as current students.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already done it this way, make sure your resume is focused on articulating the skills you gathered from your major, especially if it\u2019s not immediately clear what those might be. Ask A Manager is a great online resource for resume, cover letter, and interview advice!",

I know for a fact that apartment employees aren't going to babysit their residents 24 hours a day so who is stopping them from leaving and going wherever they want? Like you can post a guard at all entrances/exits of GV's campus, but good luck doing that outside of that.",

That means Ottawa County may be involved with enforcement, which means the Sheriff's Department. What might have been a noise complaint about a party, for example, could now involve fines or even jail time. And GV is now mentioning the possibility of expulsion, which is new.",

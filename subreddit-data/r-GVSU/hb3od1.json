    "postText": "GVSU's website says you can use either Windows or Macintosh. Personally I can't stand Macs but I'm willing to buy an Apple laptop if it'll help me succeed in the Graphic Design program. Any current or former students who can help me decide what computer would be better situated for the work (even better if it doesn't matter!)?\n\nNo, I'm not accepted into the program yet. Just a freshman trying to get a head start because I want to get in.",

            "comment": "I just graduated from GVSU, and was in the Ad/PR and photography programs. While here, I've worked with multiple graphic designers, as well as using Illustrator and InDesign myself. Most classes will be taught by professors using MacOS, however, as long as your computer meets the specifications from Adobe, you should be fine with your Windows machine. \n\nThat being said, there are a couple other things to consider. \n\nWhile you're here, I would learn to use MacOS since a large chunk of the creative world works on Macs and you'll want to be proficient with it by the time you graduate. You don't necessarily need to own a Mac to do so though since all the art computer labs here are equipped with them and you'll be able to learn it on those.\n\nYou should also make sure whatever computer you do end up using has a decent screen that can recreate colors accurately. Macs are known for having good screens, while PCs can vary. A good screen will make sure you are actually making stuff in the colors you think you are.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions, I can pass them along to my friends in the GD program!",

                    "comment": "Thank you very much for the tips, they've helped me reach a conclusion. As much as I want to remain in my PC bubble, I think in the long run it would be beneficial to have my own Mac computer since you said a good chunk of the professional field uses it. For all I know my first GD-related job could require me to have my own laptop. Plus, I'll eventually have to tackle MacOS regardless. \n\nAs for other questions, I can only think of one more, which is honestly unrelated. Since I figured out my passion just a year ago, I don't have a portfolio so I'm doing 3 Foundations courses my fall semester. All of my classwork will then be judged and determine my admittance to the program. So I'm curious if any students were in my boat and found it easy/difficult to get admitted. I'm not an amazing drawer, but I excel in digital projects which is, you know, what GD mostly is. Obviously I understand if you can't find someone to answer that, haha.\n\nAgain, thanks a bunch!\n\nEdit: I thought of a legitimate question; GVSU's computer guide recommends 16 GB of memory but has that proven to be enough?",

I also didn\u2019t have any work to show when I applied to the university to be admitted as an art major so I took the three foundation courses fall of freshman year and did my review then like you plan on doing. It wasn\u2019t too terribly difficult, as long as you complete all of you assignments and show that you put effort into all of them you should have no problem. Your foundation professors will also be a great help if you are concerned about your work not being up to par for review. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask them questions!\n\nAlso as far as the computer goes 16 GB of memory is plenty, but I would recommend getting a computer with lots of storage space. I bought my Mac book air from the laker store (you get a student discount!) the base model does not have very much storage space so I would get one model up, 500 GB at least! You burn through it quickly.\n\nIf you have anymore questions at all feel free to ask, I would be happy to help!",

I've been making myself way too anxious these past few months because I was terrified of the admission being extremely difficult. I'm the type of student who's always trying to put 100% effort into my work, so I hope my judge(s?) will be able to tell!\n\nI ended up buying a computer from Apple itself last week because I decided on 32 GB of memory and the bundle didn't include the specifications I (thought?) I needed. Whoops.\n\nUhhhh at this point I think I have another question. How did shopping for art supplies go? I assume, like in high school, you get a supplies list your first work then just go out and buy everything, right? I honestly have no clue what to expect since the only traditional art course I took gave me my drawing materials day one. I doubt college is like that, haha.",

Usually the first day of class you won\u2019t need to bring anything except maybe a notebook and a pencil unless your professor sends an email ahead of time stating otherwise. For the most part the campus book store will be selling everything on those supply lists. However sometime they do sell out or you can find what you need cheaper elsewhere. My first semester I spent a couple hundred dollars on supplies so it can get a bit pricey just a heads up. Some supplies you only use once and can share with other students like fixing spray for charcoal drawings, usually the professor will let you know what those items are and you can coordinate with other students. Also I know it\u2019s a bit of a ways out but if there\u2019s something out of stock first week of classes that you need send me a DM! I still have most of my supplies and I can lend things out. I will be in Calder all day so I can drop it off easily. And again if anymore questions come up or you need clarification lemme know :-)",

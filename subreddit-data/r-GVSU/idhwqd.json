    "postText": "TLDR: Fall break is cancelled, classes will go entirely remote after thanksgiving (including finals), and students are expected to complete the online assessment daily. \n\nThe email from Mantella: \n \n\nDear Lakers and Supporters:\n \nThe start of the Fall semester is nearly here, and I am delighted to welcome new and returning students to Grand Valley State University. We are ready for you, but the environment will be different from prior years as we adjust our already robust health and safety protocols to deal with the COVID-19 virus. As many of us return to campus and students move into university housing or local apartments, we continue to make decisions based on science and the attributes of the communities that host our campuses. I want to thank the Ottawa and Kent county health departments and other federal, state, and local organizations that have guided us through our reopening plans.\n \nFor current information on the plan, please consult the Lakers Together website and the Lakers Together Protecting Each Other handbook.\n \nThe most important part of the plan relies on all of us to follow safe behaviors. You have no doubt seen the news stories with parties and gatherings near college campuses at which too many students gather without social distancing and few, if any, face coverings. We are counting on our students to avoid such behavior and instead to be models for the rest of our community and for college students around the country. Lakers are leaders and never before have the stakes been higher. \n \nImportantly, we ask all students to pledge to follow the university\u2019s health and safety rules. The pledge will be accessible upon logging into Blackboard. The Student Code of Conduct has been updated to include language specific to the safety of our community. We will enforce compliance with health and safety expectations, including at events and activities that take place off-campus.\n\nBeing on campus, for those who want or need in-person experiences, is a privilege we must preserve. We understand the best ways to mitigate the spread of the virus, and you will be reminded constantly on our website, our social media platforms and in our physical spaces. We know to wash our hands, physically distance and wear masks when indoors or within six feet. We must commit to each other that we will follow these simple guidelines to keep each other as safe as possible. This applies even if you live off-campus. We are working with neighboring apartment complexes and landlords to encourage a unified approach to enforcing public health guidance and state and federal regulations.\n \nWhile we cannot guarantee a virus-free campus, we can assure a comprehensive, efficient and expedited response to the virus. We expect everyone to take the self-assessment each day. This will flag symptoms or exposure. Our partnership with Spectrum Health will help us with our health care response. We have adequate isolation and quarantine spaces for students within our housing units. Details were sent to you on August 17.\n \nIf you decide that you would like to take all online courses, advisors will work with you to adjust your schedule. If that decision leads you to cancel your university housing contract, you will be able to do so without financial penalty. The university also reserves the right to adjust the academic calendar as it sees fit or move totally remote if situations with the virus dictate that action would be most prudent. The Provost, in consultation with the Deans and the Chair of the Faculty Senate, has determined that we will cancel fall break. Classes will instead continue during fall break (October 26 and 27). In addition, we will ask that after Thanksgiving break, any class that can be delivered remotely do so. The reason for this is to minimize travel. We realize that some classes will need to continue with face-to-face delivery after Thanksgiving break because of experiential learning activities. Final examinations will be conducted remotely.\n \nThe arrangements we have made are aimed at supporting your success. We are honored that you have chosen Grand Valley on your journey to a college degree and all that it will make possible in your future.\n \nGo Lakers!\n \nSincerely,\nPhilomena V. Mantella, President",

The people who make the financial decisions don't care about you - only your money",

I\u2019m still online. On top of that you also cannot pause the internship. Many programs have periods of time where taking a pause is literally not allowed.",

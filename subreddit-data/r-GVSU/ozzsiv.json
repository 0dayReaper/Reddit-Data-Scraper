            "comment": "CS Alumni here. Overall I thought the program was great. I came in with little to no programming experience and did alright. The professors are all exceptional and knowledgeable except for maybe 1 or 2 IMO. Compared to other universities, I think that the professors at GV actually \"care\" about you learning as opposed to somewhere like U of M where I hear that some profs there let you drown. The smaller class sizes help in this aspect. I believe a lot of the stuff you learn can be applied to the real world, although it is really dependent on which professors you have and what you decide to focus on. My advice is take electives that you think you want to apply in your career later on and research your future profs on ratemyprofessor.com. Hope this helps.",

I have not applied anywhere out of state but I don't think the school you went to matters in terms of employment options. Most employers just care that you have the degree they're looking for. Of course some will be looking for the Stanford or U of M grads but there is really no way for me to know that.",

I mean I just interned at a company in Lansing Michigan and there were college students from MSU and I can tell you right off the bat, none of them have ever taken a speaking class in college or a resume/job preparedness class. GVSU focuses on making the students in CIS be more well rounded when they get into the industry. Most bigger schools try to just give as much information on the major or subject you are trying to become a professional in but they usually miss out on the social aspects and the job preparedness part of becoming a professional. Not trying to bash on MSU but like the fact that the CIS students there have never taken speech (required at GVSU) or have never been taught how to write a good resume is shocking. Tbh I\u2019m kind of glad I picked GVSU, made really good friends and there are hella parties as well (if your into that).",

Just the fact that having an internship is required in the CS course work just makes me believe GV wants you to go the extra mile which is great. MSU, and Purdue (some of the colleges kids attended at my workplace) don't require you to have an internship which is devastating. I just got offered a part time position this Fall from my internship and I'm still in college! This all wouldn't have happened if I did not attend GVSU. You would love it here at GV!",

I transferred in with a decent knowledge of programming and I feel like what I\u2019ve learned has been valuable so far. Most of my professors have been phenomenal and the other classes you have to take like Discrete Structures are really interesting. There\u2019s not a lot of choice in your courses besides electives but the courses you have to take are interesting. \n\nIf you\u2019re at all interested in a graduate degree they have a hybrid program to earn your bachelors and masters with some overlap. It saves time and money. I\u2019m happy with my decision to apply. \n\nThe area is also great! COVID aside, there\u2019s a lot to do here and I\u2019m looking forward to participating more on campus. GR features a lot of cool restaurants, the art museum and public museum, and the Frederik Meijer gardens.   \n\nMost places don\u2019t care where you get your undergrad, so pick a school you like in an area you could see yourself being for a while. A CS degree from GVSU is just as valuable as one from UofM. Hope this helps!!",

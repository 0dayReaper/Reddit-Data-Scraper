Start a groupme with the class to ask questions, collaborate, and know you aren\u2019t alone. Eliminate distractions if you can\u2019t focus. And lastly, if this class is important for your career, know what that this class can be rewarding down the line with how well you prepare. If it isn\u2019t, try to maintain a decent grade and don\u2019t burnout",

            "comment": "So, what follows is what I preach to my own students as well as to my faculty colleagues. It's also the advice that I follow myself. \n\n1. *Track everything on a calendar*. If your prof isn't forthcoming with due dates, apply some pressure. With a lot of assignments, you ought to be able to plot all of them on your calendar in advance, so if nothing else, you can see when things are coming and plan accordingly.\n2. Corollary: *Scrutinize all incoming emails and course announcements* for information about upcoming assignments. This requires checking email and announcements at least once, preferably twice per day. When you get a message, read it thoroughly for information about upcoming stuff, then extract that information into a trusted system that is outside your brain and which you review daily. For example, you can put information from emails and announcements into [Google Keep](http://keep.google.com) or a plain paper notebook, but **capture and review** on a regular basis. \n3. *Schedule time for your class, out of class.* If your class is 3 credits, budget 6 hours per week outside of class, or 90-ish minutes per weekday, for focused and mindful work on those assignments. Treat this time like a secondary class meeting for which attendance is required. This practice is called [timeboxing](https://hbr.org/2018/12/how-timeboxing-works-and-why-it-will-make-you-more-productive) and it is transformative if you follow it. If you believe you don't have 90-ish minutes per weekday for the class, look at other stuff that you're doing and decide whether it's a higher priority than your class, and if *not*, then consider opting out of those activities to free up the time. \n4. *Break up multi-step assignments into their smallest parts and do one part at a time.* If you have to write a paper, for example, that's not a \"task\" but a *project* that consists of a sequence of tasks. Focus on the question: **What is the next physical action that I can do to move that project forward, given the time and context that I have?** \n5. *Use the [pomodoro method](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730)* to work in short, focused bursts of 25 minutes each followed by 5 minutes of rest. During the 25-minute sprint, eliminate all distractions --- turn your phone off, put on some noise-canceling headphones, etc. and work laser-like for 25 minutes on ONE THING. It's hard to find two hours to do something, but it's less hard to find 30 minutes. \n\nI can keep going here, but those are the big ones. Actually there's a sixth: **Talk to your professor about what you need.** If you are feeling overwhelmed by the workload, don't just suffer in silence but bring it to your prof, who I can assure you wants to hear about this kind of thing regardless of what it may look like.",

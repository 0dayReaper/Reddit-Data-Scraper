            "comment": "Most of the rental houses around the outskirts of downtown seem to be around ~$1600/mo. If you can find a few roommates, it can be pretty affordable (I live right by Donkey Taqueria and Outside Coffee Co and my roommates and I each pay $400/mo). You can find a bunch of house listings on Zillow.\n\nAs far as apartments, the cheapest you will probably find will be a subsidized apartment (check out \u201cLive Downtown Grand Rapids\u201d). You tell them your income, and they adjust your rent accordingly. I\u2019ve seen their single bedroom apartments for as low as \n$550/mo. \n\nOtherwise (not subsidized) it\u2019s an easy $1200+ for a single bedroom apartment downtown.\n\nHope this helps.",

The girls who work in the Live Downtown office were definitely terrible and rude, and the process of filling out all the paperwork and being on the waiting list was super annoying... \n\nBut I had a brand new 850sq ft apartment on the 5th floor facing the sunset with a walk in closet for \n$700/month lol... prime bar hopping spot on Ionia. Even had my own parking spot in a parking garage attached to my building... it was definitely very dope.\n\nI ultimately left because they kept sneaking the rent up on me. When it came time to re-sign (on what would\u2019ve been the 3rd year), the rent had gone up $100 since I first moved in.\n\nTL/DR: The people suck but the apartments are dope.",

If you like more of the apartment style and have a car, Off Broadway Apartments or Hopson Flats would probably be your best option as they were around 550-620 each I think when I was looking. If you don\u2019t have a car something like Fulton Place isn\u2019t that bad either, but non-curbside parking is ~100 a month.",

I personally loved Winter Hall and would recommend it for the easy access to campus and downtown. I decided to move because I had an internship up on Alpine and wanted a little more space. \n\nOff Broadway was a great place to live. Yeah, it\u2019s a college place so there\u2019s parties, but a lot of MSU/Ferris professional students were there when I was so it wasn\u2019t overwhelming. Also, the place being an old factory=thick walls. The building was really cool and you had a TON of space. \n\nI\u2019m sure the pricing has changed since I graduated. I remember not paying above 600 for either option.",

I know it has been posted on social media &amp; removed a few times, I won\u2019t be posting it bc there\u2019s really no need to. It\u2019s already been shared with authorities for other reasons. I will say I don\u2019t expect GVPD or the university to comment on the campus incident though. I know they gathered a lot of information yesterday &amp; things aren\u2019t turning out to be as \u201csuspicious\u201d as they seem. They used that terminology in the first place because the body was found without ID. Still a tragic event for family &amp; friends who have experienced a significant &amp; unexpected loss, but GV never tends to address these things further even though the community is obviously very shaken up.",

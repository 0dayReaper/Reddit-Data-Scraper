    "postText": "I am considering taking an additional semester in college to try and lighten my coursework before applying to PA school. I would also like to retake 2 classes to try and get higher grades. I was already planning on taking a gap year as is, but I wasn't sure if graduating later is looked down on.\n\nAny insight would be much appreciated!",

If the money isn't an issue, and you're not in a rush to get out, do what YOU want. It's your life, your education, and your stress, ya know?",

For this degree at GVSU, I am a rarity in the department as the degree plans on you taking 4.5 to 5 years to graduate. Don't worry about the perception of what other people think and definitely don't feel bad about taking a 5th year. It would definitely be ideal for you to graduate in only 4 years but that is only if you are concerned with the financial cost of college, but if an extra year in college increases the amount of money you can earn, you should definitely stay in school.",

They just want to make sure you complete what you said you did- time doesn\u2019t matter.",

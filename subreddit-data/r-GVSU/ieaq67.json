    "postText": "I made an appointment to look into going all online this semester (I have asthma and I live kind of far away, with how vague GVSU has been I don't feel confident) right after the Covid game plan was sent out and every online class is full and there was very little the advisor I worked with could do for me... Some classes were still available but they were definitely not classes I'm interested in taking. I find it funny they sent out their Covid response late enough that even if students want to change to online classes they pretty much can't... And then the audacity to say in their email \"Just talk to an advisor to switch to online!\" It's a mess.",

            "comment": "The university put advisors in an unfair position. They don\u2019t determine which classes are online or not. They have literally no say in any departmental decisions. They had no say in anything, they only know if classes are open or closed and what order is the best order to take them in. but now students are emailing them and are pissed off that their advisors can\u2019t do anything to help.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this happened to you today.\n\nHonestly, you should email your professors and explain your situation. A few professors on this subreddit said that even though their classes are hybrid or in person they are making it possible to take completely online.",

Everyone's just frustrated but I'm sad if we start taking it out on those who don't deserve it. I'll definitely talk to my professors, thank you:)",

First of all, like /u/booksOnTheShelf said, some profs such as myself have plans in place for students to participate in classes fully online even if it says \"hybrid\" on Banner. Second, if professors hear from students who want to take all online courses, we can communicate this up the chain to our department chairs, who are in charge of scheduling courses at the department level. \n\nIt sucks that communication has been such a problem.",

            "comment": "I had to be online everyday looking for a spot to open to an online section of a class. You could check today when they open registration back up after the payment deadline. I think that's at 3pm. \n\nIt might had been better if they dropped everyone from all classes, then made the changes for what's online or not, then started the normal registration process again. Instead they just make the changes and kept all the student so for those that wanted to switch to online or in person, needed to wait for spots to open up in the sections they wanted. I know for me this was hard and I was on top of it multiple times per day to check. \n\nMy advisor said to ask the prof, the prof said to speak to registration. So it is a mixed bag out there.",

I was vaccinated December of last year, but was curious what they'd do if I didn't turn mine in. \n\nIts been nearly a month since the deadline and I have gotten zero communication from the university. Is it all a show? Anyone else in this situation?",

            "comment": "Here's what I know - Administration is waiting for additional guidance from MDHHS and the Ottawa County Department of Health before deciding what repercussions will be. There was a meeting earlier this week looking at the number of students/staff not in compliance, the potential impacts and push back that could arise from different repercussion considerations, their legal grounding, etc.\n\nHere's what I'm speculating - Before the admins make a decision, they want to see if the health departments will have updated guidance that gives them more enforcement teeth. If the state or county don't update policies that would support moving forward with harsher penalties, the repercussions for those not in compliance will be likely be minimal. I have a hunch they saw what [WMU is dealing with](https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2021/10/western-michigan-university-loses-appeal-over-student-athletes-and-vaccine-requirement.html) over the student athletes not in compliance there and the legal issues surrounding that.\n\nI'm honestly not certain which direction it will go, but the sense I get is they really don't want to punish anyone, they just want campus to be safe. I know they've been reaching out to those not in compliance and trying to connect them to resources that will help inform their vaccine decision or to get an exemption.\n\nThat all said, if you haven't been vaccinated or received an exemption, please do so! Both are really easy to obtain.",

The last email I received included this:\r  \n\r  \n\u201cCOMPLIANCE - In order to reach 100 percent compliance, we need everyone to get vaccinated or apply for and receive an exemption. Outreach from the Virus Action Team to the remaining 8 percent of students and employees who are not in compliance will end October 15, 2021. Following that, students who are not in compliance will be contacted by the Registrar\u2019s Office and employees not in compliance will be contacted by Human Resources. As enforcement of noncompliance begins, it is our goal not to disrupt learning or employment during Fall semester.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019d imagine if you haven\u2019t reported your vaccine status through the daily assessment and if the VAT hasn\u2019t already emailed, called or sent a letter yet, the Registrar\u2019s Office may be waiting to reach out until administration gets the updates they\u2019re waiting for from the health agencies. More speculation \u2013 given how far we are into the semester, they might not enforce anything until the winter term. I kinda doubt they\u2019d boot students from fall classes after they\u2019ve already put in as much work as they have, after buying the books, moving into housing, getting parking permits, etc. My guess is maybe they\u2019d put a hold on registration for the winter semester and beyond for those that haven\u2019t reported their vaccine status yet. Once proof is provided, then they\u2019ll let the student register. Again, just speculating.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019ve been curious if any student would be brave enough to test those waters, so I\u2019d be interested to hear how it works out for you!",

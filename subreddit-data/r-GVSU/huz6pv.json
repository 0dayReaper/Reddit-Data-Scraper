But so far I am not convinced by these town hall meetings that GVSU, or any other university really knows how to handle the pandemic. Sure, its not GV's fault to be in this situation - it's ok not to know what to do, but don't lie to us that you have everything under control.",

If they do sound confident, they're accused of lying or being overconfident/over optimistic.\n\nSome students are commenting and emailing that they won't attend unless classes are face-to-face. Other students are commenting and emailing that they won't attend unless classes are completely online.\n\nAdd to this the problem that GVSU has to have things planned in advance because it takes time to implement things. I have seen some of what is behind the scenes, and they're listening to students, parents, faculty, staff, and trying to balance needs.\n\nIn order to try to balance the desire for face to face classes and minimize risk, they have implemented teaching models that haven't been used at GVSU, and they had to find ways to make those models transparent to students.\n\nThey are currently trying to find ways to reach out to as many students as possible to troubleshoot schedules. They are asking faculty and staff to do more, and at the same time trying not to overwork employees.\n\nI don't think anyone is saying everything is under control. I think a better way to say it is that they are doing all they can to control what they can and be as safe as they can while meeting the needs of various groups.",

Some people have watched town halls and read emails etc and others are just complaining because they can.

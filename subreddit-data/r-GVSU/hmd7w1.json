I'm pretty good with spanish vocabulary and grammar, but I just need to freshen up on the rules a bit, so if anyone can give a list of things they typically test you on in the placement test, and maybe even what sort of vocabulary is good to review that would be helpful! Thanks!",

Vocabulary is useful, but I don\u2019t think it will make or break your placement. Read up on conjugations and don\u2019t suck at vocab and I think you\u2019ll be alright.",

Then study how and when to use them all, especially subjunctive v. indicative, and the conditional tenses. \n\n202 was my last semester of Spanish, but by the end of 202 you\u2019ll have a rudimentary understanding of every conjugation there is. Anything beyond 202 is basically heavier reading comprehension and vocabulary.",

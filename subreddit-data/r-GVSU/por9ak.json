Not sure if posts like this are allowed but..\n\n I'm 19 and a pretty quiet/introverted guy so we'd probably click if you are as well. Dunno if those MBTI personality tests mean anything to you but apparently I'm ISTJ-A? As for my interests, I enjoy nerdy shit like PC gaming, anime, manga, comics, fantasy books, cartoons, movies, metal/rock music, TV shows etc. I write too and I wanna learn how to draw (but don't know where to start ). Hmu if you're as lonely as I am \ud83d\ude03",

If it\u2019s socially not a good fit, it\u2019s just not a good fit. If MSU isn\u2019t the only school with your degree path, nobody will really care in the end. Don\u2019t sacrifice your mental health for a few words on a paper. \nI chose to start looking for friends off-campus. Sometimes it\u2019s just easier/healthier to get out into the general community rather than staying in a campus bubble. \nEither way, you should really figure out if you are happy in your environment. College is hard enough even with friends to support you.",

GV has a ton of clubs and MSU is a lot bigger than us, so I'd imagine that there's got to be a club for you. \n\nSomeone mentioned finding an extroverted person - totally recommend that! Before my brother (introverted) and I (extroverted) left for college, I would always invite him to hang out with my friends and my friends loved him. He really broke out of his shell by being around extroverted people.\n\nI play video games on a couple different platforms if you're looking for people to add though! I'm on Steam, Nintendo Switch, and PS4 :)",

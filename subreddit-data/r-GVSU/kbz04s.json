    "postText": "Hi guys! There\u2019s a lot of speculation going around right now, all anybody knows for sure is the information about the body found near north campus, article below \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/lakeshore/ottawa/body-found-on-gvsu-campus%3f_amp=true\n\nGVSU sent out an advisory email to be aware of surroundings, and report any information to the GVPD 616-331-3255\nor Silent Observer 877-887-4536\n\nI ask that speculation be kept out of this thread as it can spread panic and unneeded stress, I\u2019m sure more information will come out in time but for now spreading rumors won\u2019t help anybody. I\u2019ll update this if more news is posted.\nStay safe!\n\nedit 1: 4:09 PM email sent out to students notifying the campus of information regarding the incident (someone already posted it in the thread take a look)\n\nedit 2: 7:21 PM GV sent out an email tonight stating it was a student from GV, and are working with state police to figure out what happened.\n\nedit 3: Earlier this evening the GVPD posted a report stating as of know they\u2019re still working on the investigation, and to not rush to any conclusions. They also said they don\u2019t believe there is any danger to the community at this time.",

Here is a copy of the email sent to students by the GVSU ALERT system at 4:09 p.m.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n The Grand Valley State University Police Department and the Ottawa County Sheriff\u2019s Office are jointly investigating a suspicious death. On the morning of December 12, 2020, a body was found on the Grand Valley State University Allendale Campus by a runner near the intermural athletic fields, south of West Campus Drive. Police said there was no identification with the body.  \n\n\nThe Michigan State Police is assisting in the investigation. Anyone with any information should contact the Grand Valley State University Police Department at 616-331-3255 or Silent Observer at 877-887-4536.  \n\n\nBe alert and aware of your surroundings at all times. At the first sign of danger, or if you see suspicious activity, call 911. If you see someone who could be in trouble, speak up or call authorities.",

This is heartbreaking news for our entire community. I offer my deepest condolences to the student\u2019s family and friends. We are not sharing the student's name out of respect for the family.\n\nI want to assure you that we have every resource devoted to the investigation and in support of our campus community. The Grand Valley State Police Department will have additional staff working on the Allendale Campus for the remainder of the weekend. GVSU Counseling Center staff are ready to provide service to anyone who may need assistance. The Dean of Students Office has additional services available and can be contacted at 616-331-3585 or dos@gvsu.edu.\n\nThe Grand Valley State Police Department and the Ottawa County Sheriff\u2019s Office, with assistance from the Michigan State Police Crime Laboratory, are aggressively investigating this incident. While there is a limited number of people on campus because of finals week, anyone with information should contact GVPD at 616-331-3255 or Silent Observer at 877-887-4536.\n\nThis is a jarring and shocking event for all of us. This tragedy reminds us of the importance of each member of our university community. Please keep the student\u2019s family in your thoughts and offer your support to those who have lost a friend and fellow student.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPhilomena V. Mantella, President",

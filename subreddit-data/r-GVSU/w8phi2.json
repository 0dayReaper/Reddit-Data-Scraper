To the typical pro-lifer, the goal isn't in any way to limit a woman's agency or freedom; 99.99% of pro-lifers want women to have as much liberty as anybody else. The concern from the pro-life perspective is that abortion is literally killing a human baby. In fact, given the scale at which abortions occur, if the pro-life position that abortion is murder is true, then it begins to look more like genocide. Of course you would be fully justified to be making a stink if you think there is genocide going on around you.\n\nIf a large group of people are claiming that a genocide is occurring legally, that's obviously something to at the very least acknowledge.",

Their lack of scientific understanding of pregnancy forces birth on those that do not wish it, even in the case of rape, incest, or inviable pregnancies. We have already seen that play out even since Dobbs.\n\nFollowing the logical path, if we are treating the fetus as a person, and calling an abortion the murder of a person, then that \"person\" should also be ascribed other rights ascribed to all people. For instance, that \"person\" should qualify for both federal and state tax benefits as a dependent (though since that's up to the states, not every one is treated equally under federal tax law, then, because if states define personhood then the ability to claim a dependent varies by state).\n\nAnd when do the rights of one supersede the rights of another? Should we force the birth that would necessarily kill a pregnant woman, simply because we wish to disallow abortions? \n\nIt's not black and white. But it does take a scientific literacy that much of the pro-forced-birth side does not indicate they have.",

A strong medical argument could be made for personhood at conception. Medical science is actually not a good foundation on its own for arguing when personhood begins. There is more that goes into that question.\n\nRegarding further rights if the embryo/fetus is a person, many pro-life people would actually agree with you. In fact, almost all the pro-life people I know would agree.\n\nAnd the question of where do one person's rights end and the next person's begin is indeed an important question. Most pro-life people would say that if the mother's life is threatened by an abnormal pregnancy, then ending the pregnancy is justified. This is a good point to discuss though between pro-lifers and pro-choicers, just not here.\n\nAnd regarding scientific literacy, many pro-life people are doctors, biologists, and a wide range of other learned professions that are well educated. Good and bad arguments on the issue of abortion can be made in either direction at any level of education.",

    "postText": "It appears there will be no traditional December commencement ceremony at Van Andel. \n\nI've received this email from the Office of Student Life: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Dear Graduate:\u00a0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We\u2019re excited to inform you that Grand Valley State University will host a \u201cMove the Tassel\u201d and Celebratory Drive event to honor our Winter 2020 graduates. This is in lieu of our traditional Commencement ceremony.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On Sunday, December 13, from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m. graduates and four guests are invited to the Allendale Campus Fieldhouse Arena to participate in the time-honored tradition of crossing the Commencement stage and moving their tassel from the right to the left to signify that they are a college graduate. Professional photos will be taken as each graduate crosses the stage while their name is announced. The event will be livestreamed so other supporters can share in this special moment. Additional information may be found on our [Commencement website](https://t.e2ma.net/click/2y3vod/q1l2jbf/uoq47j).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Graduates and their guests can then participate in a celebratory drive through campus to relive the fond memories of their alma mater.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Although not required, regalia can be purchased through the [GVSU\u2019s Oakhall Order Form ](https://t.e2ma.net/click/2y3vod/q1l2jbf/ahr47j)online. Tassels for undergraduates will be provided at the event. Other graduation mementos may be purchased on the [Commencement Mementos page](https://t.e2ma.net/click/2y3vod/q1l2jbf/q9r47j).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To maintain the health and safety for all students, guests, and staff, graduates will reserve a time to take part in Sunday\u2019s events based on the college from which they will graduate. You will receive an invitation to RSVP in November which will allow you to select a specific time to participate with other graduates from your college.",

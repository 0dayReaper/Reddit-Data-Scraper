I\u2019ve taken them before and hated them particularly totally asynchronous classes. The thing that really annoys me is I picked F2F or Hybrid for a reason I didn\u2019t want to do fully online so when professors make them online 2 days before classes it\u2019s essentially giving me a giant fuck you. What changed between 2 months ago and now that suddenly warranted changing to fully online.",

I commented in another post that when the option to take classes online was opened up to faculty recently, I surveyed my students to see what they wanted -- in my calculus classes, 60 students between 2 sections, 30 students responded and 2/3 of them wanted to keep the class hybrid, and when prompted to elaborate on their reasoning they all basically said what you said. So I'm keeping all of my sections hybrid until something changes my mind (e.g. all those students saying they want hybrid change *their* minds).",

You'll have to keep yourself much more organized and self-motivated to stay on track, which is a lot of work. \n\nGVSU did not have a consistent plan from the get-go in planning the Fall semester and that is very clear now that students and faculty are scrambling.   \n\n\nWhat I would offer is to explore the resources available for online learning to see if you can find tips or tricks that will help you with the class. **Ask for live office hours, even if it is via Zoom.** Check the library's online learning tips. See if you can connect with classmates.   \n\n\nJust because a faculty member moved their class online doesn't mean they can also bog you down with extra reading and busy work. If this is happening, email the unit head for that department. Call the Dean of Students Office. If you are struggling, contact Disability Support Resources to see what accommodations you may qualify for...",

GVSU has handled this extremely poorly, no matter what side of \"in person yes or no\" you fall on; at this point, a student wanting to take a gap year because of this sudden change (not the prof's fault that they weren't allowed to choose for themselves much earlier in the summer) would need to go through all of the hassle of filing that paperwork, dropping classes and getting the refund, possibly dealing with loans, and possibly needing to find something else to do for the next year to support themselves. They may have already signed a lease that they're stuck in, their job might be on campus, or they might even be a grad student, which adds another layer of complexity.",

Located approximately the same distance from GV as Enclave. \n\nCould it have something to do with the layout of the complex? Each building has its own front door, large parking lots(?) honestly I don\u2019t know. But \u201cGV students don\u2019t live there\u201d isn\u2019t a satisfactory answer in my opinion.",

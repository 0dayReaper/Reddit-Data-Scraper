    "postText": "I know this is a long shot, but is there anyone at GV that would be interested in a motorsports club, similar to what UNOH has? I know we have the Formula SAE team, but I have a huge passion for circle/short track racing and it's something I want to be able to do, even while I am in school. \n\nThe team would basically build a Street Stock or Sportsman style race car throughout the racing off-season and race it at tracks in the area, like Berlin Raceway which is right by campus. I want a team that builds on mechanical and automotive skills, but also has a sense of community and fun that you would find with any local short track team. I am still trying to work out the details on what funding, team roles, etc. would look like if the club were to be established. I just wanted to put it out there and see if there was any interest before I spend too much time trying to figure out how everything would work.",

I've always been looking for other people at Grand Valley who have the same interests as me. Out of the 25,000 Grand Valley students, there has to be a good amount of people who would be interested if words gets out.",

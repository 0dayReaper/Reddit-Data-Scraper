There will be both in-person and online components to instruction in the fall semester. We plan to end all in-person instruction on Wednesday, Nov. 25, with remaining instruction, study sessions and final examinations moving remotely for the remaining three weeks of the semester.**\"\n\nLooks like they're sending everybody home Thanksgiving weekend, with instruction and final exams happening remotely after that through the end of the semester.",

It was obvious from the start there was gonna be some covid on and around campus and our cases were about what most who did think about it were expecting. Me and my flatmates can\u2019t learn online and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here, don\u2019t try to take that from us just because you can\u2019t think things through.",

Go ahead and assume that we all had a choice if that's what makes you feel better though. It's valid that you don't want all online classes for the reason you stated but how about you don't come in here and make accusations about people whose circumstances you know nothing about.",

For those that will be quick to respond with \"but my major...\", \"but as a &lt;fill in the blank&gt; student..\", etc you still made the choice.\n\nIs there a potential for setbacks if someone makes the choice to not take classes this semester? Absolutely. \n\nThe hard reality is that every single person (whether they want to admit it or not) weighed the decision to take in-person classes against the risk of contracting covid.",

If students, like me, have loans of any kind you have to start making payments back into them if you arent in school for a set amount of time. For a lot of students going into repayment isnt financially optionally for them right now so they have no choice but to continue schooling.",

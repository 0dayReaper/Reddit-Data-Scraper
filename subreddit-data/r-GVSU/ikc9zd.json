That parking lot used to be surrounded the Ravines apartments, where I lived in my 2nd year. :) They tore them down a few years ago since they were decades old. Kind of a nice little quiet place to live, though it sucked having to walk all the way over to Kleiner to get food, especially on freezing days.",

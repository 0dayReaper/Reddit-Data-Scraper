            "comment": "BIO 120 is known as a \u201cweed out\u201d class, although it can be taken by non-bio majors, the course itself was designed in part to show the rigor the GV biology classes take. It is meant to have students really make sure that they are ready for bio classes and that if they aren\u2019t, they develop the necessary skills needed to continue. Essentially, it \u201cweeds out\u201d students who aren\u2019t up to the standards GV sees fit to continue in the major. \n\n\nI recommend taking advantage of the free tutoring system as well as office hours with your professor.",

            "comment": "A couple of tips that go for any class, as a Bio major:\n\nOffice hours, and communicating with your professors in general, are excellent things to take advantage of. Students forget that office hours are there FOR YOU and your professors genuinely want to see you succeed. Personally, in my second semester of organic chem I spent time in office hours at least once a week, and I was almost never the only one there. If you're struggling and afraid of falling behind, tell them right away.\n\nThe other thing is to study with your fellow students. Working with each other to understand the material means teaching each other. In my mind, there is no better way to find out where your gaps in knowledge lay than to try and explain something.\n\nAnd just to add: you are doing exactly the right thing by asking here right away. Good for you with recognizing your potential struggle.",

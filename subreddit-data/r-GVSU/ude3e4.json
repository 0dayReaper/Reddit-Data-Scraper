I heard that heating up your windshield, either with a bucket of hot water or by running your windshield defrost on max heat &amp; max fan for about 15-20 minutes will weaken the seal enough that you should be able to pry it off. Obviously, that\u2019s a bad thing to do and you totally shouldn\u2019t do it and I\u2019m only telling you how to do it so that you don\u2019t do it by accident.",

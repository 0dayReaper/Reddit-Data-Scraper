    "postText": "Let's use open carrying firearms to get the school to be on the news and to show their greed off on the news and our distrust with the new college president. I'm not encouraging violence whatsoever. I'm just saying guns to liberal arts colleges is like garlic to vampires. A protest with firearms could get us on the news and really show the administration we aren't messing around and will smear this schools reputation at any cost possible. Which I assume an open fire arm carrying protest against would most definitely catch the eye of national news with attention the school would hate extremely haha",

If you want to talk about the university's lack of transparency, how slow they've been to make and announce decisions, disagreement with what those decisions have been, etc. then raise those issues here. Organize a protest on or near campus (physically distanced, please!). Try to get your concerns in front of the public through the media, public meetings, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut none of this has anything to do with guns and bringing them onto campus just to raise hackles is not a good way to be seen as a rational part of the conversation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I say this as a gun owner. I'm picking up my new suppressor this evening. I just don't think that introducing guns to the situation helps either cause.",

Clearly not but the idea here is the administration is likely somewhat probably for gun control being that it's a liberal arts college, so if we are legally allowed to open carry on campus which honestly I think we would be since it's a public school then we would upset them and it would get on the news all about our protest. Probably even make national headlines u/nolanater5711",

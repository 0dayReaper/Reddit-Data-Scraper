I know people who have gotten these calls. I never got one. So I called the 800 number for the COVID-19 resource center myself. I was able to schedule a screening appointment but I was told that they do not follow up on failed assessments and you must call yourself.\n\nI was supposed to come to campus today for work so I also tried navigating the [Emergency Sick Leave Policy](https://www.gvsu.edu/studentjobs/student-employee-sick-leave-54.htm). Student employment was under the impression that this only applies for extended leaves of absence but they didn't know. I tried calling HR for clarification but got their voicemail.\n\nI give up. Grand Valley have no idea what they're doing and classes start in a week.\n\nTo anyone on the Virus Action Team who may read this, here are my questions:\n\n* Will people who fail their self-assessment receive a call to follow-up?\n   * If so, when can we expect these calls?\n* Does the Emergency Sick Leave Policy apply to student workers who fail a self-assessment?\n   * What documentation would be required for this?\n   * Who do we submit the paperwork to?",

            "comment": "So I'm a student employee for the Office of Movement Science, we had a student call about getting a yellow check on their self assessment and after about 15-20 minutes of calling different places my boss and I figured out who you're supposed to call. Apparently you're supposed to call:  616-331-5811 to ask what your next step should be. So I guess the whole \"they'll call you\" was a lie. The horrible things is that they only have a single person assigned to answer all calls headed at that number. GVSU has absolutely zero idea of how to handle this.\n\nEdit: Also yellow check means you were flagged for having traveled outside of  Michigan, you can still head to campus but they advise you make sure you didn't travel to a Covid hotspot first. An orange check means you show some symptoms, you can still go to campus but they advise you to stay home and get tested. A red check means you need to stay home and are strongly advised to get tested.",

                    "comment": "Dude seriously just take a gap year. There are seriously just too many benefits strategically you could have right now from taking one year off as a freshman or incoming sophomore if your reddit tag is wrong.\n\n1. First of all you can use that gap year just to be able to save up more money and be more financially well off for the expenses and random things you will need as you go through school. Can also use the extra money from living at home and working to have more money to buy more stocks and investments at the dip when the market and the economy crash. Thus setting you up to make a lot of money off your own money in the present and distant future.\n2. Second of all working will make you more mature and take school more seriously because working a garbage job will make you appreciate the opportunity to better yourself and get a degree that is valuable that leads to a much better future. You will like studying more than working most likely and will have more endurance for when things get tough in your classes.\n3. This is a prediction, but I think tuition and costs of attending will reduce and be less soon due to them losing more attendance as time goes on from this. I think gvsu will lose some prestige and will come out of this looking really bad and they will likely reduce costs or do something to try to really want to win back the students they have potentially lost due to their bad practices and lack of organization. Barons has even had an opinion piece that has predicted that college tuition will likely see a collapse in price soon.\n4. Furthermore, this is a really shoddy college experience to have right now. Freshman year is really important due to it being where you make most of your social connections and with all of this red tape that is going on right now you won't get to experience a true and legit college experience. Online classes also aren't the greatest, and really I think the best choice is always to choose the best option that makes it the easiest to succeed for yourself. Waiting out one year to take classes is a really wise choice if it means the chances of you getting full irl classes is worth it because your instruction and learning will be much better. Odds are you will get better grades too, and you will not have to work against the stream of disorganization and chaos that most definitely will occur due to online courses and most professors not being even slightly prepared to teach online. Coming from experience I will tell you that not all professors are equally organized or equally able to help students much with being able to reply to emails or phone calls very much. Most of the time you will basically be learning all by yourself with no guidance in many courses. Things will be sporadic and inconsistent and I'm 100% you will at one point be tripped up by weird due date info not getting sent out right, bad instructions, or even less explanations on things and being able to not ask as many questions due to online instruction. In fact, even with offline courses bad organization among some professors is a problem. I worry how those same said professors fare with online teaching.\n5. In conclusion, due to you not having any college debt yet now is the perfect time to take your time and not rush into a bad decision by beginning to enroll at gvsu right now during this pandemic. Take your time and learn about yourself during this gap year and make some money. In addition, you'll have a more clear mind that so you can then use your mental energy more effectively towards your studies due to not having to deal with unclear problems and issues due to lack of info from your college and your professors. Most of the time finding out something you need to know will be tough right now. I am the type of guy to ask a lot of different questions about things to know what is going on with certain things, so that I can have the information to make the best decisions I can. From my experience lately I have come to the conclusion that most if not all of the staff at the school pretty much has no idea on specifics with anything you could ask them right now that is related to the situation we are in right now. Nobody knows what is going on, and if they ever find out it is only at the very last minute. The leadership under Mantella seems to be just making up the specifics for things as they come along at the very last minute. There is no plan and nothing has been very well thought out. She also doesn't have your best interest at heart. One of her first update videos she posted for covid back in around March she was talking about how people shouldn't take a gap year. Which makes sense because of course she doesn't want that. She is pressuring people emotionally like a loan shark to get people to sign up even if it isn't in their best interest. She said nothing about how maybe people should think for themselves and decide what is best for them. She has no incentive too. She is here for your money only, and is only looking out for herself and not any of you here. By taking a gap year as a freshman right now though you put pressure on them for things to change so that when and if you end up enrolling here again and starting you can then have a better experience and the faculty will actually take us more seriously and be more upfront and honest with us and do what the students want.",

I have an apartment off campus, so I have options of working around the Dale or at home.\n\nI don't know that GVSU will specifically come out losing credibility for the general public, moreso universities in general. Let's just wait to see how many schools go bankrupt with no athletic departments!\n\nI may work something out with my counselor to just take a couple online classes per semester, but I'm too far into my degree to take courses at a community college.\n\nFeeling stuck between a rock and a hard place.",

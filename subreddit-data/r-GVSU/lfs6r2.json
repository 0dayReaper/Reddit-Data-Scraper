This should have been an emergency situation and they should have gotten someone there quicker. Unless of course the train hit the bus shortly after it got stuck",

The engineer was able to slow the train, but not stop it. The train hit the bus at 4mph.\n [Source](https://www.woodtv.com/news/grand-rapids/no-injuries-when-train-hits-rapid-bus/)",

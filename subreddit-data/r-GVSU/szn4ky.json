For the records I looked at, it appears about half of the trainings/courses actually count towards college credit. Unfortunately the GVSU course equivalency system doesn\u2019t include JST (as far as I can see) so I don\u2019t know if there is a chart anywhere that breaks down what trainings actually count for.\r  \n\r  \nIf you haven\u2019t submitted a JST yet, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it.

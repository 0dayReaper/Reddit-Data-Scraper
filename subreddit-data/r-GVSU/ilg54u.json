I got the call about 6 business days later, but I called the urgent care every day after a week had passed to see if the results had come in. I seriously doubt that they wouldn\u2019t call you at all if results were negotiable, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was a lesser priority than alerting those who did test positive. \n\ntl;dr If you have any phone numbers to call, call them.",

Faculty are prohibited from having an attendance policy that directly affects grades.\n&gt;2. Notes from health care providers are not necessary for \u201cexcused\u201d absences.\n\nI'd take that as a \"no\", since this doesn't differentiate between online versus F2F attendance. \n\nThere was some thought in other posts about this that profs who have attendance policies that directly affect grades might just have accidentally included it when updating an old syllabus. I'd encourage any student who has a class with this kind of attendance policy to bring this Provost/UAS policy up with the professor and ask for a clarification. Because it's not supposed to be happening.",

The Provost's document I linked above says\n\n&gt; Class participation may still be part of a student\u2019s grade as engagement can be accomplished in multiple ways which do not require students to be \u201cin-seat\u201d during the course.\n\nSo if I were to require participation (which I do) I have to provide some asynchronous version of that participation for those who can't or choose not to attend (which I also do). And it says \"in seat\" but it's in quotes, so I would interpret that as applying to synchronous online participation as well.",

I emailed the Prof requesting an override and she was ecstatic I wanted to take it and helped me make it happen. \n\nDepending on the class, size, prof, etc. It should be a really easy process.",

There\u2019s also an emphasis on pitch relationships. \nBeing able to count rhythms and already have a basic understanding of music is a must.\n\nThis class will also require you to practice at home. It usually isn\u2019t an easy skill to develop by singularly relying on in class participation.",

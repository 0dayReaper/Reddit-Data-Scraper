It\u2019s just the ones who are doing it really bum me out.",

From 8/27 to 9/2 the rate has increased 5x from .66% to 3.48%. \n\nEven if it levels out at 3.48% and you extrapolate that across the GV community, that\u2019s nearly 975 cases (based on 28k). Of the current active cases, 75% are faculty/staff, on-campus students, and students that live within 1 mile of campus. \n\nSo, there could be over 700 cases from those 3 groups, assuming that the current positivity rate levels out at it\u2019s current rate. \n\nBut going back to the positivity rate, that\u2019s what GV is using to determine the threat level and how GV responds. We\u2019re currently in the Medium range (3-10%). That means that even if the positivity rate triples, we\u2019ll still be in the Medium range and it will be business as usual. At 10%, we\u2019d be closing in on 2800 cases. \n\nSo again, the positivity rate of the tests is what we need to keep an eye on.",

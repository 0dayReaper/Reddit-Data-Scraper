    "postText": "Hello! I was looking at Grand Valley\u2019s curriculum online and saw it had a course called Computer Science Project (capstone course). I am curious if anyone has any examples as to what type of project(s) you create? How big of a project are we talking about? Is there a theme or a general goal of these projects? It sounds really fun and I am looking for some insight.",

            "comment": "When I completed my cs capstone a few years ago, the capstone course was a way for us to get experience working on an actual project for a company. The professor has us fill out a survey on our skills and interests and then we were divided into groups that worked with companies in Grand Rapids. One of the projects though was a \u201cstartup\u201d idea that one of our classmates led. So it\u2019s still a good experience developing a project over an entire semester, but you don\u2019t have the freedom to necessarily make your own project in most situations.",

My one buddy who took his last semester was in a group that was tasked with taking a program that had a lot of python 2.7 scripts and they had to update it to run python 3.x scripts. Then I knew a couple people who took theirs last fall and their project was literally to design a website for a company on Wordpress. So the projects themselves can differ pretty wildly. But it\u2019s basically just like a final, semester-long project that you take to show you learned something.",

We basically never heard our neighbors, and we had them on both sides, and the office staff are amazing. They even helped us out with getting package that was delivered to our apartment 6 months after we moved out. Also, the walk to the bus stop in front of Main Street isn't too bad, so you don't have to worry about getting to and from campus.",

            "comment": "I lived there for a couple months back in 2013 so I'm not sure what all has changed/stayed the same. Rooming with randoms made it the worst experience of my life. However, the apartment itself was not bad. I was in a 4 bed/4.5 bath. The room, bathroom and closet were all huge in my opinion. I was an end unit so things were pretty quiet. I would usually ride my bike to campus but I don't remember the bus being too bad either. I wasn't pleased with management before I moved out though. My roommates basically pocketed my money for utilities and we eventually got shut off notices in the middle of winter. I went to the office because I did not want to be charged for any damage from frozen pipes because our heat was supposedly soon to be shut off. They talked with my roommates separately and my roommates threatened me during that convo. Office told me to \"watch my back\" when I was at the apt. I'm not a small girl and would like to think it takes a bit to intimidate me, but I was honestly terrified to go home and always snuck in quietly and kept my door locked constantly. The girls were sisters and hated me so I don't think I'd come out the winner of things went south which was possible with their attitudes. I ended up moving out and I don't remember the office charging me a fee to break the lease. After all said and done and I had time to process everything, I was pretty disappointed with how it turned out. From what I understand from a landlord friend, if the office had actually heard the threat being made, which they did, they are required to call the police. They didn't do that and instead tried to play mediator which I thought was out of line for a management company. \nTHAT SAID, I think my experience is not common, at least I hope not. It was very stressful to go through that and hope no one else has to. I have also roomed blinded at Campus View and that was completely fine. So, if you have roommates you know and trust, I'd say go for it at Conifer. If you room blind, use caution (as you would anywhere) and know your rights as a tenant and make sure the office holds to that.",

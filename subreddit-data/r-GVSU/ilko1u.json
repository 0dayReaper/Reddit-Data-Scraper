    "postText": "Hello friends!\n\nI work at the GVSU Laker Store in our web orders department, and hoo boy, we're super overwhelmed this year. We've got about 3000 incomplete orders as of today (including partial orders with backordered items) and are understaffed due to potential COVID exposure, so please be patient with us. On a normal year, we probably would have shut down web orders at this point, but due to COVID we understand that not everyone can come in store to shop, so we're leaving it open.\n\nWith that being said, I have a few requests of you all to try and reduce further backups.\n\nFirst, consider if you actually want to place an order online. As of now, it's taking us about 7 days to complete new web orders due to the sheer volume of things to get done. If you need your books ASAP, consider coming into the store and purchasing them yourself through our selection on the second floor. If you do decide that you can wait for a new order, great! In that case, keep an eye open for an email that says your order has been processed before coming in.\n\nSecond, be sure to thoroughly read any emails we send you regarding your orders. We send an email to you when you place your order confirming that we received it, then once it's ready for pick up another email saying it has been processed (the best practice is to wait a few hours after this email before coming in so it can be boxed and shelved. Unfortunately, we have to process the orders on a computer before they're boxed. Otherwise, we might have to search through bins of unlabeled orders to find yours.). If there are any problems with your order you may receive additional emails. Read these emails through and be sure to follow any instructions given. If you have any questions for us, you can send us an email at [lakerorders@gvsu.edu](mailto:lakerorders@gvsu.edu)\n\nThird, if you are thinking about calling us, consider if your question or request warrants a call. Our phones have been ringing constantly the last few days which is part of what is adding time to the new order process. Things like order cancellations, adding another person to pickup in the case that you failed the GVSU self assessment, and checking on the status of your order can be done through email and will allow us to focus on completing orders. The main thing to call about now would be if we contacted you regarding an issue with your order.\n\nFinally, when you come to pick up your order, please fill out your self assessment beforehand and be sure to follow its guidelines. You can then come to our station in the parking lot of the store where we'll have a line of people that we send down to pick up their books. In that line, please wear your mask properly (we know, it's hot and uncomfortable but it's for your and our safety), have an ID ready for when you pick up, and know that we greatly appreciate your patience.\n\nThanks for reading my spiel, we all appreciate your patience this year. If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to get back to you.",

Saved me a shitload of time just too look up the ones I need, and pull em off the shelf. I remember looking down from the library and just seeing a huge ass line of people waiting for books this week. Just my two cents. Godspeed otherwise.",

Get a mask, hold your breath, and speed shop for 5 mins or as fast as you can. Of course pending how risky this is to you as a person. \n\nAlso, don't get your books until you know exactly what you need. I'll be returning one that wasn't truly needed and that would have saved me a bit of time.",

If I have someone coming over on a Friday and they plan on staying the night, what time should I tell them to arrive? I know parking services doesn\u2019t ticket on the weekends but I saw their office closes at 5 on Fridays, does that mean their parking patrol stops ticketing then too? I\u2019m assuming this is the case but I just wanted confirmation from other people. TIA!",

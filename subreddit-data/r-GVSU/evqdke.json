As the building for all the higher-ups of the university, they keep those bathrooms in PRISTINE quality and cleanliness at all times. They\u2019re spacious, too, and there\u2019s rarely anyone ever in there. Sure, most students don\u2019t usually walk in there randomly, but nobody is going to tell you not to be there, and I can guarantee you it\u2019s by far the best bathrooms on campus.",

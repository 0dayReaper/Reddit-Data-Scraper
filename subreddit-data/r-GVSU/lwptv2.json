    "postText": "It\u2019s honestly a pain walking all the way over there (especially in the cold/poor weather) just to pick up a package, especially if it\u2019s a big one. And I\u2019m over in freshman land, so I\u2019m literally at the dorms closest to it. I can\u2019t even imagine what it\u2019s like for people on south campus (where I\u2019ll be living next year). I personally think it\u2019s irresponsible and quite frankly, ableist, of the school to only have one package center in a tiny corner where no one lives. If I started a petition (more well put together than this post, obviously) to either move the package center to a more central location or opening a new one specifically for south campus, would anyone be interested?",

            "comment": "FWIW, the Ravine Center was never designed as the package pickup location, it became the location because there wasn't a better option.  Ravine Center was \"empty space\" before the package pickup moved in there.\n\nThe problem is that especially in the last handful of years package shipments have grown enormously. Far more packages are shipping then every before and so far, far more space is needed to house all these packages than ever before.  Standard living center \"offices\" just don't have the room for packages during peak times.\n\nFurthermore it's expensive as all get out to manage.  At times literally hundreds and hundreds of packages can be received during a day (peak times).  You need equipment to receive all these into a system, you need employees to process all of these (including trying to figure out all the mis-labeled packages, returning packages not picked up, investigated packages mis-delievered to spots on campus/off campus, packages sent to people who are no long students living on campus), you need the aforementioned space to store the packages securely.  Consider if you had to train, equipment, and house all that stuff for each living center, how much more expensive it would be?  All of this expense with really zero off setting income for the campus.\n\nNone of this is to say that the current setup is ideal... or even adequate.  In a perfect would I'd like to see *at least* two centers, one north and one south, more centrally located within the living center areas.  But... this of course costs money and during a covid time there's probably no budget for any new construction or even renovation of existing areas to handle this (assuming an existing area is available for use).\n\nNot trying to justify the current setup or say that we shouldn't advocate for better arrangements.  I just wanted to share some background.",

But I do agree, I feel like the community centers could do package pickup since they get letters anyway. Or at least have 2 or three package centers that get the packages for the closest living centers. Or just put package pick up in a centralized location. Lots of solutions. Even if all the ones I mentioned are not feasible I can't imagine there is not something they could do.",

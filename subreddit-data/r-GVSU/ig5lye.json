I know how poorly I learn online and how well I learn from in person instruction, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve enjoyed much choice in whether my courses occur online or in a classroom. I\u2019m pretty thankful that my courses have pretty low enrollment since they\u2019re upper level and in a small program. Right now, I have 2 in person, 2 hybrid, and 1 online and I\u2019m fairly comfortable with how things are looking _personally_ and I\u2019m very grateful to be in that situation since so many very much aren\u2019t in as good of a position as I am.",

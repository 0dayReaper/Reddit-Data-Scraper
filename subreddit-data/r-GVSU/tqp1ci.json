    "postText": "Hi, kind of panicking here! \n\nSo I submitted an override request for a class earlier today, and I ended up looking it over tonight. Because I'm such a genius, I ended up accidently canceling the request (make sure you pay attention to where you're clicking, kids!). I emailed the college that the class would be located in and my advisor explaining the situation. I was wondering if anybody had some advice about what else I could do? This class is really important to my schedule; as in need it to graduate, can only take it that semester, kind of important. \n\nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nUpdate: \n\nI'm an idiot, figured out how to send in a new request, lol",

But yeah, I definitely agree, besides the advisor I'm working with now (she's great, bless her lmao) I've been given advice that ended up being super unhelpful, or was just a bad move for me as far as my degree/graduation timeline goes. Kinda wish that wasn't the common experience, but oh well ig",

It\u2019s recommended you submit override requests sooner rather than later so that the course does not fill up while you wait for a request to be approved.",

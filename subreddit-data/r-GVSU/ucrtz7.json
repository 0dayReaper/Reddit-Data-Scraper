            "comment": "Originally came to GVSU as a CIS major. It really depends on what professor you have for 162 since it\u2019s a really important foundational class to prepare you for 163 and the rest of the major. \n\nPersonally, I really struggled in 162. I went to every office hour to seek for help and put countless efforts to practicing how to code. I know some of my peers excelled the class without as much work. I think that it\u2019s something that you need to try because it depends on the person and GV has a really good program. For 162 I recommend Professor Posada she is literally the best at teaching the course!\n\nThe class consists of weekly Zybooks(homework), three projects, weekly labs, and midterm/final. \n\nI took the class last semester. If you have further questions feel free to send me a message!",

            "comment": "CS prof here.  There are 2 types of students in 162: those for whom the material comes naturally and those for whom it does not.  I think a lot of the answers here are from the first group.  There are a lot of students who really struggle in 162.  Granted, many of them don't put in the time and effort but I don't want you to get the wrong impression.  \n\nMy two cents:\n\n* treat it like it is a 4 credit class - it is a 4 credit class.  It's a lot of work.  Make sure you keep up with the assignments and learn the material thoroughly.\n* be social and try to work with others in the class.  I remember students who just didn't seem to get it but they didn't give up and they worked with others a lot.  It helps you to learn the material and to keep you accountable.\n* there are many good profs but yes, I agree with others here that professor Posada is excellent!\n\nI also encourage you to have a growth mindset (see Carol Dweck ted talk) before you start.  Best wishes.",

You were a great professor and kept things engaging and lighthearted.\n\nI specifically remember the day after the 2016 presidential election, I had you in a morning class for 162 or 163. Obviously tensions were high, many students including myself were in mild shock over the election results.\n\nYou opened class with: \"Before we begin, let's take a moment of silence... for the victims of the election.\" It made me laugh and definitely improved the mood in the room.\n\nSomeone in this thread mentioned 162 and 163 potentially switching to Python, is there any truth to this? On one hand, obviously Python is more accessible to first-time programmers and a valuable language to know, but on the flip side it can lead to some bad habits when switching over to languages like Java or C.",

Otherwise, the difficulty will vary depending on your problem solving abilities and interest in the field. But like I said, if you go to class and put in the work it\u2019s a guaranteed pass.",

It\u2019s more introductory than anything. 162 is a good feeler class to see if you are actually interested in computer science. 163 is the \u201cweeder class\u201d.

Just a for warning, this class is heavily project based meaning the whole class revolves around projects. If you are also trying to soften how hard the class will be for you, learn Java. It\u2019s the most important thing for you in that class. Also learn word definitions like what\u2019s a pointer, what\u2019s a string. And some Object Oriented based questions like how to define a constructor, why is a class used, how to create objects, etc. This will help you a ton with the exams and definitions to learn!",

Although frankly, I would try and take it with java. There's a few stupid -isms with java - especially at the beginner level - but it's a pretty decent language once you clear that hurdle.\n\n... I guess the big question is how much knowledge of java, and of programming languages in general do you have going into this course?",

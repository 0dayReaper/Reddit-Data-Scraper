I\u2019d do some research with k-maps and logic equations to see if you enjoy the introduction to the major. Gvsu\u2019s EE program is a little more stressful from what I heard about other college\u2019s programs, but it ensures you\u2019ll have a job after college. It definitely isn\u2019t as easy as your typical business major, but if does come with it\u2019s share of perks with nice labs and equipment. If you\u2019re fine with all of those criteria\u2019s then I say go for it and I wish you the best of luck. You might need it ;)",

The program focuses on a lot of hands on learning and you will do a 3 semester co-op which basically serves as a long term interview. Most people end up being offered jobs by the companies they co-oped at. \n\nControls engineers (a field EEs can go into) are some of the most highly sought after engineers in Michigan and command a really good starting salary (80-100 k).\n\nOverall I highly recommend giving it a shot, it is a lot of work while in college but there is almost guaranteed employment and good salaries down the road.",

It\u2019s one of the better programs overall I think because of how much project based work there is in comparison to other schools. I\u2019ve gotten to use FPGAs and microcontrollers way more than my friends at MSU or Michigan. It also makes you more well-rounded as an EE due to the fact that you are required to take certain classes that would be electives at other colleges.",

    "postText": "I'm looking to get my GIS certificate. I don't see a way to add that on banner or mypath. I emailed my major advisor a week ago about enrolling in the program as well as seeing what it would mean in terms of graduation date. I'm wondering if I'm not really supposed to just email my advisor with questions, and should try to schedule an appointment with some one else? Generally confused about who and how I contact about something like this. Any advice helps!",

I was getting the GIS certificate too. You don't sign up for anything you just receive it on your transcript once you fulfill those credits.",

So it is possible that even thought you emailed a week ago, they still haven't physically had time to respond to you. I don't think it is meant to be disrespectful, but just that your advisor is overworked.",

I didn't know it wasn't something I didn't need to enroll in, so I added a GIS class next semester and hopefully my advisor eventually contacts me.\n\nBut, does any one know if there'd be a reason a GIS class wouldn't be able to fulfill 2 requirements? I'm a Geology major and I was planning on taking GEO 425 which fulfills an elective for both my major and the GIS requirements. I'm a junior so I'm trying to plan strategically.",

If there are none left for you to take, ask a professor or someone else who has worked in the field what they suggest. For example, if your major is Spanish, a Latin American Studies class would be a good one (or vice versa). If it\u2019s business, maybe an economics, math, or history elective, depending on what kind or business you want to go into. \n\nThese will usually be beginners courses (level 100 or 200 unless you already have more credits in that area). Communications 101 is also always a good one, and not too work intensive (I was a Comm major).",

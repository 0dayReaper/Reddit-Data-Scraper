I got called for jury duty back at home and since I don\u2019t want to travel 1,000 miles I\u2019m trying to get an exemption which requires me to send in my class schedule. I tried sending the one from banner, and the app but they said it wasn\u2019t \u201cofficial\u201d enough(needs name and school logo something like that). Anyone experienced something similar that can help me out? Any help appreciated, thanks.",

As others said, I would contact student services or the registrar office and they should be able to get you an \"official\" document.",

Employees have been asked to triple their work load with no pay increase and a hiring freeze. Communications have been vague and unhelpful. We are being pressured to return to campus despite safety concerns, for the sake of appearing as though everything is normal. I don't feel supported at all, and I am afraid my job will be threatened for speaking out. Disappointed with how things have been handled, to say the least.",

I have submitted my questions to the town halls, but those things are so scripted that they skip over any real answers to our questions. Before Covid GVSU had a strict, no working from home policy too.  I resent that I have to represent GVSU but the communication from the top has been so poor that I am often asked questions I can't answer.   \nStudents, we know you are struggling with your options. But please have grace with staff. We take the brunt of the anger from students and parents but have no control over the decisions being made.",

However, what bothers me is that there is very little public pushback against admin from staff/faculty. We as students have extremely limited leverage. I know staff have a reason to fear for jobs...but it would be obvious if they were reprimanded for speaking out and it would cause a PR nightmare for admin. I truly wish a bunch of staff would sign an open letter or pen an opinion piece in MLive. That\u2019s where a lot of my frustration with staff comes from I guess if that makes sense.",

I'm no longer a student, so I don't know how bad things have become, but if it's as bad as people are making it out to be, leave. Go to a community college for a semester or a year. Believe it or not, the school will notice and they will be forced to make changes. This pandemic is not an ideal situation for anybody, but don't think that because you have no voice, you have no leverage. Let your money do the talking.",

Full-time faculty have been asked to make a huge increase to their course loads.\n\nThis whole situation sucks.\n\n* It sucks for the university, because their costs are increasing as they try to figure out how to move forward at the same time that enrollment decreases.\n* It sucks for employees because full-time faculty have to figure out how to teach in suboptimal circumstances and deal with supporting way more students. Many part-time faculty and staff are losing their positions.\n* It sucks for students because just about everything done to accommodate physical distancing is hurting the quality of the education they're getting.\n* It sucks for parents who have to work with their kids to figure out what is best during this mess, whether that means going to school under these conditions, transferring out to a model they like better, moving their kids home while they take some time off from school, etc.\n\n2020 really is a dumpster fire.",

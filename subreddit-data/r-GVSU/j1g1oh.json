A lot of the Seidman books (BUS, MGT, MKT, ECO, etc.) have custom ISBNs for GV, so you won\u2019t find them online.\n\nEdit: I checked the website and the book is a custom book, MANUFACTURING PLANNING &amp; CONTROL CUSTOM, so you won\u2019t find it anywhere other than the Laker Store or another student.",

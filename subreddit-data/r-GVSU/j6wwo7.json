Id be different if the additional charge was going towards making improvements to parking/roads. Its not like the cost of maintaining a parking spot is sky rocketing. Demand is just thought the roof. They need to start working on increasing supply with the extra money they make from demand.\n\nIts an infrastructure  problem thats built into the campus. Theres literally only two roads north/south and 3 exits, that has to change at some point, traffic is already at maximum during class already so that should take priority and once thats handled increase parking. Rates for parking should cover all the road maintenance and parking enforcement. It shouldn't be arbitrarily raised to limit poor peoples access to spots or cushion other departments pockets.",

I know it's probably a very strong knee jerk anger because it may be your first time experience this kind of sticker shock but:\n\nCollege fees are not an \"experience\" and thinking that way is wrong headed\n\nPricing for physical space is always ridiculous and always goes up. Prices don't go down unless there's a crash \n\nLocation, demand, function, availability, and more go into price points, and comparing differences in housing and parking is pointless because it's an apples to oranges comparison. \n\nI get it's weird, and it feels like injustice, but it's perfectly normal and something to get used to in life so it's great practice! For example I just learned daycare where I live, which is necessary when working in office is required again, costs $1800 a month! And if you're late by 5 minutes for pickup it's $100 charge. Same with early. Prices suck, seem to make no sense, but it's often just stuff the average person doesn't understand, it just \"feels wrong\".",

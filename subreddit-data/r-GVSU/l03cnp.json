    "postText": "Hey guys I am a GVSU student who is currently living off campus and was curious if there was a time when it is free to park on campus in order to go to the Rec center... I know that the bus is an option but with COVID I\u2019d prefer not to take that onto campus where it wouldn\u2019t even drop me off near the Rec Center. I also don\u2019t really want to spend $250 on a pass for going to the gym for 1 hour about 3 days a week (just seems like a waste) I talked to parking services today and they informed me that there is no free parking during the day but I began to think if there is a time where parking becomes free to anyone until the morning where I expect the green jacket police would come and write people tickets",

So going to the Rec Center in the evening and the weekend is your best bet. \n\nIf you're looking to go to the Rec Center in the morning and park for free, you might be out of luck, unless you want to just take a risk and hope you don't get ticketed.",

Take a look at what r/grandrapids has been doing since lockdown, frees up the entire front page for news, art, photos, shit posts, and memes\n\nI know this sub is small but it's always growing. It keeps getting bigger and I prefer an organized sub. Can't believe people are genuinely upset at the idea of a megathread that detracts from nothing\n\nIf r/psychologystudents can have megathreads I have no idea why we wouldn't",

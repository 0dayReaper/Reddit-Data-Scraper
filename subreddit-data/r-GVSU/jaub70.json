Cold call them, or find them on indeed\n\nAlso the e scooter company is hiring downtown and that's super close to Allendale. 15 an hour to pick up scooters sounds easy. Thread on the GR subreddit",

You can promote to a supervisor relatively quickly which bumps up to about $19. Flexible hours and and not super difficult work.\nIt\u2019s seems like it\u2019s probably not related to your field or your skills besides doing physical labor, but I\u2019d recommend it for a short - medium term job during school",

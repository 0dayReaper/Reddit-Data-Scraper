You don't need to spend the $2000+ on a MacBook unless you want to (which is fine too).\n\nUnless you are in a major that requires a computer to have certain qualities like graphic design or something all you need is a paper-typing Netflix machine.  That's it.\n\nNo one will look down on you and you absolutely won't feel weird if you don't have a crazy top of the line MacBook if, after some introspection, that is a concern.  One thing you'll find is different about college than high school is that no one gives a fuck about the things you have or the stuff you enjoy in college.  Honestly your probably going to accidentally spill coffee on it or bash it into a building door anyway.",

Nobody really will judge you on your clothes, laptop, accessories, car, etc. I was so afraid that these would be the case. Heh, on my bike coming from class the zipper of my backpack went. I heard a crash and a scraping sound. That was my Macbook Pro skidding down along S. Campus Dr near Connection. Went the rest of the semester with it all scuffed. Aside from the bill, makes a great story.\n\nRambling aside. Yeh, unless you're in a major where you need specific hardware or software beyond the basics, and they'll let ya know' you'll be fine.\n\nAlso, GV has free downloads of Microsoft Office and Windows 10 available to you as a student.",

There's so much professors assume their students know by default (like reading a syllabus or what office hours are for) that can be tricky to navigate as a first-gen. Number 1 tip: get to know your professors, remember that 90% of them would love the chance to get to know you a little better and help you out with things you're struggling with (the other 10% are jerks and/or clueless). Also: make sure you meet with a professional (not faculty) advisor (in the advising center for your college) at least once a year to make sure you're staying on track for graduation and being as efficient in course selection as possible, and take full advantage of things like the Knowledge Market. If you have a hard time adjusting to the workload, the Student Academic Success Center can be an awesome resource with success coaching and workshops. You're paying for all this stuff in your tuition so use it to your advantage!",

The only issue I ever had was that external hard drives need to be formatted either to windows or mac, and one can't read a device formatted for the other. However, with cloud storage that may not be an issue for you at all. \n\nI saw you asking further down the thread about using Office 365 and wanted to let you know you don't have to worry about that at all; I've never had a problem.",

You can also just submit PDFs for course work most professors will be fine with it.\n\nThe student pricing ranges from $50-250 based on the laptop you purchase. Every year around July/August Apple does a Back To School special where you still get the student discount but on top of that you might get a gift card/headset/printer/iPod etc., that special differs each year, but in recent years it\u2019s been beats. \n\nWelcome to the Laker family!

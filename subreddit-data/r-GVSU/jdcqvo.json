    "postText": "My first ever vote was as a sophomore in 2008, Obama's first term. I was living in Campus View, and when the election results started getting conclusive, I rode my bike up to Kleiner to watch the final announcement with everybody. A historic moment. Congrats if you fall into this category - what a wild moment in history we're living through.",

I think it's important for us to remember why we fought the Civil war -- let's not forget that the good guys won! I think this petition is a giant waste of time. This statue is in no way glorifying  white supremacy -- it's recognizing that we fought a war to advance human rights. How about you organize to make our community a better place instead of being professionally offended by anything that's triggering.",

They could have held his hand or put him in front or just not included him.  It was intentional to have a child crouch down between then with 2 soldiers standing back to back.  The message of the statue is that these soldiers will guard the child, but not as an equal.  Not as a person but as a lesser.  The soldiers were on opposite sites, but you don't see a confederate soldier crouched down between 2 union soldiers.",

            "comment": "GVSU FRIENDS!!! \n\nHey everyone, as many of you know there is an infuriating confederate monument in Allendale, the home of GVSU's main campus. When a community group organized a protest against it, local politicians called in well-armed white supremacists to defend it. A few of us were at that protest and it was scary - some of the same people involved in storming the state legislature in April were present. GVSU's president weighed in on the issue, but the language was not very forceful, and the Allendale Township Board remains committed to keeping this statue up. The GVSU History Dept recently approved a much stronger statement calling for the removal of the statue, and in the hopes of putting pressure on both GVSU and Allendale, we would love to share it more widely. If you are connected to GVSU as a student, staff, or faculty member, you can help us do this! Go to the link below and you can sign the statement in support of the department. GVSU as an institution is committed to equity and inclusion, and it should take a clear stand on Allendale's confederate monument.",

This petition feels like virtue signaling to me. \"These monuments were put in place by groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy to inscribe in public spaces their conviction that white supremacy...\" NO! This is a statue of American soldiers in THE VETERANS GARDEN where it belongs. There's no message here of white supremacy. Only a history lesson that life is really hard and that the North cared enough about our African brothers and sisters to go to war to fight for their rights. Tearing it down would be a signal that we shouldn't remember this fight for justice and human rights.",

Before we do that, we need to address the quote you pulled from the petition. That quote was put there to give context to the initial proliferation of confederate statues in this country and why there were erected. This petition is in no, shape, or form claiming the United Daughters of the Confederacy put these statues here, just that they were the first group to erect them en masse. The United Daughters of the Confederacy has been widely accused of promoting white supremacy and white-washing history for a long time. If someone disagrees with that, prove otherwise. \n\nFor the statue, it depicts a Confederate soldier and a Union soldier standing with their back against each other (in a protective position)over a slave boy holding a sign that reads \u201cFreedom to Slaves\u201d dated January 5, 1863. Firstly, why are they depicting two COMBATANT soldiers defending the same thing? The Union and Confederacy fought largely over the continuance of slavery, with one group (the Confederacy) leaving the country/attacking the other group in effort to continue the practice of chattel slavery. \n\nSecondly, the date on the paper the slave is holding is at best, historical inaccurate and at worse, white-washing. Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation on 01/01/1863 and the last slaves weren\u2019t freed until 06/19/1865. So why the date chosen? On 01/05/1863, Jefferson Davis (Confederate President) said : \n\u201cMay God prosper our cause and may we live to give to our children untarnished the rich inheritance which our fathers gave to us.\u201d \n\u201cOur cause\u201d was fighting to persevere slavery. Yet, the statue has him protecting a slave. \n\nThis statue is not accurate depiction of the Civil War at all. This statue paints the picture they were both fighting to free the slaves when in reality, one side started a war to keep slavery and the other fought back to reunite as a country. I haven\u2019t heard about this statue at all until I saw this post, but holy shit its intellectual dishonest. They should haven taken this down based on that. Funny how the argument was to \u2018remember our history\u2019. I would agree to keep it up it actually portrayed reality, but this statue serves as propaganda to Confederates.",

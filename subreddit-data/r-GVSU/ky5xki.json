Lived in a 1 bed freshman year, liked it and would have done it again.\n\nCampus West- great for the price, especially the 1 or 2 bed apartments. Parking is rough, PARTY CITY but was pretty quiet.\n\nEvolve/Locale- worst living experience I\u2019ve ever had. We had to threaten a lawsuit and broke lease and went to Enclave after 3 months. Will never recommend.\n\nEnclave- very pricey but in the 5bed-5baths it\u2019s so worth. Super party heavy but nice amenities and gym. Don\u2019t do it if you\u2019ll be by yourself though.",

If youre living with people you don't know super well, or are working on separate schedules, the separate bathrooms are perfect. Never a problem, moderate noise on the weekend, but never as bad as lodge, alpine or trio",

One bedroom seems about the same price as 48 ($990/month), and from the comments here I think you get a lot more bang for your buck at WW. \n\nIt\u2019s easily the nicest place I have ever lived. Super quiet, and management is great. A little further from campus so that may be a drawback, but food for thought nonetheless.",

                    "comment": "I believe a large part of the rationale for this change in the mask policy is to keep masks going in places where people HAVE to go, and making them optional in places that are more optional.   \nYou HAVE to go to class, because that's the point of being a student here. But going to the Rec Center or Laker Store isn't generally a requirement. If you're comfortable going in those places without a mask, cool. If you're not, you can either mask up, or avoid those places.",

So what you are saying is technically true but consider this: you can have a group of 10 students outside a classroom with no masks talking in a close huddle and that is fine.\n\nAdditionally if a room is not being used for an academic meeting (aka if there isn't a class going on in the room) masks are not required. So if you were to have a club meet in the classroom club members are not required to mask up. But a class meeting in the room is. \n\nNot to mention office spaces on campus do not require masks even if they are small. \n\nI'm not trying to argue and I think OP is being disingenuous on purpose, but the policy doesn't exactly make sense on all fronts when read and considered carefully. \n\nI work at one of the academic offices, faculty, staff, and department chairs have asked for clarification on these points and have been confirmed that the above interpretation is correct so this isn't a case of bending or misinterpreting the rules.",

If people want to huddle in a circle, they\u2019ll do that. They\u2019d do it in their dorms, so doing it in the hallway wouldn\u2019t be much of a difference. As for clubs meeting in classrooms, I believe that would still require masks, as the list doesn\u2019t specify whether the classroom is being used to teach or for other purposes. \n\nI\u2019m sure there are behind the scenes purposes for GV\u2019s new stance. I always suspect nefarious deeds from our school. So you\u2019re probably right to some degree. They wouldn\u2019t do this if they thought it\u2019d hurt their financial earnings lol.",

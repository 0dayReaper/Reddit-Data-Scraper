(Can\u2019t remember the course number off the top of my head.) It\u2019s a fantastic course that teaches you practical skills in jewelry and metal sculpture fabrication. As a heads up, many introductory studio classes allow non-art majors, so might be worth meeting with an advisor and chatting about some options. Hope this helps!",

    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all,\n\nI\u2019m planning on skipping class until GVSU inevitably closes down. Is anyone else looking to do the same thing? I haven\u2019t reached out to my teachers yet because my classes are not available on Blackboard, and I want to wait until they put some information up so that I can see how they feel. \n\nJust trying to get a feel for how supported I will be in this decision, and if there is any reason I should NOT skip my classes. \n\nI\u2019m also wondering about the COVID screener. If I \u201chave\u201d any of the symptoms, would I have to stay home? Would that allow me options to take in-person classes, online? \n\nI know nobody probably has any answers, but I\u2019m curious as to what you all think.",

I wish I was able to do that and distance myself from this inevitable disaster, but alas. I would imagine professors would have to be understanding of your decision considering the world is quite literally ending.",

It\u2019s hard to take a year off at 25, and push off that graduation further. Especially because the engineering program is laid out in a way that necessitates a pretty specific course timing. But, this is something I may consider!",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I recently got admitted into the Graduate Applied Computer Science Program. I'm really excited about the news and look forward to meeting everyone.\n\nOne of my initial tasks is to come up with a detailed study plan for the program director to review.\n\nFor folks who are currently in the program or who have graduated, how many hours did you guys set aside for the foundation courses and the core/concentration courses? \n\nAlso, what's opinions on the program? And is there a discord or FB group for CS majors and/or graduates. GVSU in general?\n\nI'm currently a full-time employee w/ basic programming experience, but do plan to eventually transition part time for focus on school.\n\n I'm determined to complete the program and get my masters, but I don't want to bite off more than I can chew and want to allocate enough time to study and do my assignments.",

            "comment": "Dr. Adams (CIS Grad Chair) is very cognizant that plans often change - the main motivation is just to get you thinking about your path and to be aware of what is offered when, etc. \n\nThe \u2018rule of thumb\u2019 for time is usually somewhere between 1-2 hours of time spent outside of class per hour in class, but this varies quite a bit from class to class (e.g., foundational courses are obviously much simpler than some newer electives dealing with newer techniques). \n\nIn my experience, the faculty in the program are not only excellent in their respective fields, but also quite invested in your success. \n\nMost importantly, there\u2019s a link to the GVSU CIS discord here on the page here: https://gvsu.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/cis-computing-club . Very active community with room for really any CIS-oriented discussion, whether it\u2019s help in class, memes, gaming, or commentary on emerging tech.",

It's actually what initially drew me to this program and GVSU. It's reassuring to know the faculty care so much about the students and their success.\n\nI'm grateful Dr. Adam reached out. He  definitely got me thinking and I now have better idea of what my academic path. I'll reach out to him soon with my study plan.\n\nThat's a good rule to know! Thank you so much for sharing. I just didn't have a good point of reference to go off and anticipated much more hours required than that. This  makes me feel better and gives me a better idea of whether or not I should remain full time at work or request to go part time.\n\nAlso, yesss! The discord. Another user mentioned it, but thanks for sharing the link to it. I'll definitely join this week. \n\nCheers!",

You won\u2019t be able to go super detailed because you won\u2019t be able to know what classes are offered in future semesters until they get closer to registration for each semester. \n\nThe classes are fun, and can be challenging. If you find them too easy, go above and beyond and you find some  other classmates will rise up to meet your level. \n\nI\u2019m just taking one class at a time right, and I would say I spend about 4-5 hours a week studying and doing homework. I also work full time. \n\nMost conversations with the MS crowd happen inside Blackboard, and if your class has an always on Collaborate video room, live chatting and video whenever you schedule time with a classmate. \n\nIf you\u2019re already working in IT and thinking about changing, check in with the GVSU IT department (not the help desk, actual IT in the Kindschi Science building top floor) , you might be able to get a job or internship there.  Internships are nice, but the job means free classes\u2026",

It's nice to hear someone in a similar situation as me.\n\nI'm kind of relieved to hear that I don't have to go too indepth and shouldn't plan too far in advance with the study plan. Most of the courses I'm interested in are only avaliable in the winter semester, atm. Hope that changes. That planning has definitely been beneficial and really got me thinking about my path.\n\nHappy hear classes has been fun as well and that there's a community amongst the grad students in the program. I never would have guessed Blackboard was the platform. Can't wait to link up and meet folks.\n\nI will say I wasn't expecting your answer with regards to time of investment for each course. I was anticipating it to be  more. Then again everyone is different but that's a great point of reference.\n\nGood to know there internship and job opportunities for students. That's a awesome for anyone who can land them. Unfortunately, I don't have a background in IT or Comp Sci. I'm a civil engineer. \n\nAnyways thanks again and all the best, mate!",

I enjoy the university, there's plenty to do, the people seem pretty nice (I'm rather introverted, but have still found people to connect with), all the professors I've had are great! Super nice and teach well, they're definitely there if you need help. And job opportunities I'd say are pretty good! Definitely make use of the Career Center, they'll help you find jobs or internships in whatever field your interested in",

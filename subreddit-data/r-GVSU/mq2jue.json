I have a job lined up after graduation so what\u2019s the fuss with me wanting to half ass to focus more on my future career (and my 5 other classes). Unreal how quick some of you jump to conclusions. All you did in your reply was judge and arrive at conclusions for no reason. 3.5 Seidman GPA accounting and finance major working every day all 4 years to pay for my classes.

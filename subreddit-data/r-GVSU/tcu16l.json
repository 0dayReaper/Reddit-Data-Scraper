I\u2019m running fine offline, but any online games just do not work for me without severe lag spikes or disconnecting all together.",

I think you have to register the MAC address and they give you access IIRC.\n\nIf you've done that my only other suggestion is to try plugging your device in with Ethernet, if possible. I used that for my desktop computer when I lived on campus and didn't have any problems.",

Ethernet is going to be the best for any serious gaming.\n\nHowever crashing every minute or so seems a bit excessive (especially since few people are on campus during spring break). It would be worth submitting a service request with [IT](services.gvsu.edu) to see if there\u2019s anything they can do on their end.",

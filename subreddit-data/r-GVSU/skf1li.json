    "postText": "I recently tested positive for covid and had to spend a week in quarantine. The day I tested positive, I emailed all my professors noting my absence and asked how to keep up with lectures and class material during my time out.\n\nMy first professor did not respond to my email and I didn\u2019t receive any guide on how to keep up with lectures\n\nMy second professor didn\u2019t respond to my email on how to keep up either, I only found out a couple days later by a classmate that lectures are recorded on blackboard \n\nMy third professor responded and told me all assignments will be on blackboard, but did not provide a way to keep up with lecture. Additionally, when I returned to class this week I found out there was a quiz during the time I was out. Now, I did check the weekly schedule when I found this out and found it was posted on the schedule. When I asked my professor if I could possibly make it up he said no and noted that he drops the two lowest quiz scores.  But I don\u2019t really think its fair that I have to use one of my drops on a Quiz that I wasn\u2019t able to attend, or provided an alternative for when my absence was out of my control due to covid. That drop should be used for my two actual lowest quiz scores like everyone else in the class. Why should my grade be penalized for me being sick with covid?\n\nI just wanted to share my experience and hopefully gain some insight on what I should do.",

            "comment": "Some thoughts from the faculty side: \n\nFor the third professor, send an email or make an appointment to explain your reasoning to them, in a professional manner. Sometimes professors say stuff in the moment without thinking about it -- in a different context you might be able to get a little more traction. If you do this, and the prof still says you have to use a drop grade, you can escalate the matter to the department chair and explain yourself to them. And if that doesn't give you any satisfaction, you can explore filing an academic grievance. \n\nThe other two profs are simply not doing their jobs, IMO. [Here on the provost's website it specifically states](https://www.gvsu.edu/provost/guidance-for-exposure-to-or-positive-test-for-243.htm#Instructorsshoulddo) that we are supposed to respond to students \"ASAP\" and to \"get back with the student in a timely manner about how to keep up with the course's workload\". I don't like the wiggle room that \"ASAP\" and \"timely manner\" provide; some profs might say that the soonest \"possible\" time they could have replied was not within a week. But that's BS in my view, and failing to reply within a week's time -- maybe they still haven't replied? -- is not acceptable and it's out of line with faculty policy. \n\nWhat I'd do in this situation is continue to email your professors asking for what you need. You can even point to that blurb on the Provost website if you want. If you're not satisfied with the results, escalate it ASAP to the department chair. If this results in harm to your course grade, I'd be thinking about academic grievances the whole way. \n\nI'm sorry this is happening and I hope you're feeling better. Unlike others here, I think GVSU as a whole has done pretty well in the pandemic --- I get to see how other universities do it, and it makes us look like geniuses --- and since I work in the president's office, I can guarantee you that the administration cares. But I hate these stories of individual faculty not doing their jobs.",

            "comment": "I've learned more and more from the past few years of COVID and the recent weather that GV administration as a whole likely does not give two shits about their students. Contact tracing is no longer being enforced because it's \"ineffective\" and \"cuts into class-time\" but had pretty much no backup plan but is still claiming that there's little to no transmission in classrooms.\n\nThat being said, there are some professors that genuinely care about their students, that will keep them updated on how they can stay on track of things if you're sick/absent. Some will even cancel class if the roads are too awful to drive on (unlike whoever makes the call to shut down campus). I'm sorry you have professors that are shit at keeping you updated, there are some good eggs out there though.",

But you\u2019re up a creek if you bomb two quizzes this semester and have that 0 that wasn\u2019t your fault.\n\nBut yeah, covid response this semester is kind of a joke. Seems like they just want to be able to say that they\u2019re doing something.",

Not exposure, not symptoms\u2014 you have to have a positive test and provide proof to the prof (and it can\u2019t just be on your self assessment, because \u201cyou can lie on that\u201d)",

I know many profs who are putting in extra work to better serve students through this. I'm sorry that yours are not. Please be persistent with the profs, write again, and if they don't respond, bring up what Rtalbert pointed out about the provost's policy. There is also the Student Ombuds office that can help in awkward situations.",

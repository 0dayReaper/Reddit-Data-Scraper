    "postText": "Any advice on sources to prepare for statistics during break? Any websites or anything? I have to take it next semester but I haven\u2019t taken a math class in ten years since I was in high school. It was honors Algebra II and I got a D, so it\u2019s safe to say math is not my forte. I emailed the prof on the 21st and they ignored me or didn\u2019t see it. I\u2019m concerned this is a sign they won\u2019t want to answer my questions during the semester either, but we\u2019ll see what happens. I want to do well in stats because it will be relevant to my career if I do research. I also want to get into a good grad school for psych eventually so I\u2019m scared this will ruin my GPA (and psych PhD programs are hard to get into). I usually get A\u2019s but I\u2019m also a transfer student so my GPA has less cushion. \n\nAlso, I need the class to transfer it back to my community college and complete the MTA so I can get into the school of social work next fall, so I can\u2019t put the class off either.",

In fairness, it's easy for an email to get buried\n\nAnother thing you can do is go to the Statistics Tutoring Center in Mackinac Hall. They are there to help, and Prof. Frobish, the director, is fantastic. Here is more info https://www.gvsu.edu/tutoring/stats/",

But especially with finals coming up, I\u2019m certain they\u2019re being emailed more than usual so what I sent was more likely to get buried. I\u2019ll check out the tutoring too. Thank you!!",

Sure, there are equations where you have to plug numbers in, but you\u2019re not really operating like you would in a math class. Basically, if you can handle problem solving, you can handle a basic stats class.",

            "comment": "I agree strongly with the person who said use the stats center. It\u2019s a fantastic resource that most schools don\u2019t have. I worked there for two years while I was working on my BS. Marcia Frobish is fantastic. Her husband is a stats professor and he is awesome too. I took every single one of his classes that I could. I was actually only majoring in psych when I took his STA216 class and I ended up adding a second major in stats, in large part because of him. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019d recommend taking full advantage of the resources that GV makes available. The stats center is super helpful. Memorize the steps they teach you, for finding test statistics. It usually starts with 5 and then later 8. Also, Google is great for programming questions. I hope the semester goes well for you. :)",

Just wanted to give a heads up to Lakers in case GV takes the same route (a lot of schools are doing away with spring break).",

I\u2019ve heard a tentative start date of 1/11/21, which is what it would be without COVID. I\u2019ve also heard other schools getting rid of spring break and/or starting in February. If GV starts in February, be prepared to definitely see spring break gone and probably the spring/summer term will be shifted somehow.",

Once the registrar's office does about 4x the normal work of planning the calendar and working out all details and pros and cons (and doing it in days instead of months) it will go to senior leadership",

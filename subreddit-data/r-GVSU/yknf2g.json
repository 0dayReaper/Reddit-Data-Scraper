    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm graduating in December and hoping to find someone to take a few photos of me in my cap and gown on campus in Allendale. I'm the amateur photographer of my friend group, so I'm always behind the camera :')\n\nI think it would be special to hire a Laker (past or present) to do this. I'm interested in a \\~40-minute session and I am happy to pay cash. I have a flexible schedule through the rest of the semester but would like some fall color in the photos if possible, so maybe sooner rather than later. Comment if you're interested and I'll PM you my cell number!! Thanks :D",

            "comment": "Hey fellow photographer in the friend group! I know that feeling.\n\nFirst of congrats for almost graduating! And good call on wanting to do an early shoot! Weather and leaves are  lovely right now.\n\nI am willing to give it a go. However, weekends and evenings works best for me.\n\n Also, I'm not familiar with the Allendale campus since I am a grad student and my classes are downtown, but I can shoot at all your favorite spots on the  Allendale.\n\nI did used to shoot side gigs, but mostly for fun with friends or folks at photography meetups, but that kinda all ended since the pandemic started and moved to MI. It's been mostly cats and landscape since then, lol.\n\nMost recent things I shot were my own elopement shoot a year ago and a friend's backyard wedding a two years ago.\n\nAs for rates, back in the DC/MD area, my rate was $150/hr, by the hour, excluding travel expenses, but it does include light editing up to 10 photos.\n\nHowever, for this session, we can just keep it at $120. This includes travel expenses and I can bump edits up to 20 photos.\n\nLet me know how that sounds? I figured I just be upfront.\n\nEven this doesn't pan out, all the best!! I'm sure whoever takes you photos will do a great job and again enjoy that post grad life!! I'm definitely waiting for it to be over.",

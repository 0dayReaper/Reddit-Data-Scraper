    "postText": "Wanted to provide this info in case anyone is dealing with the stress of an overpayment redetermination. Something like 200,000-300,000 Michiganders are currently facing massive bills from the unemployment agency, most of these \u2018redeterminations\u2019 are erroneous and the claimants absolutely qualified for the PUA.\n\nThe Michigan house of representatives has already passed a waiver bill that would sort all this out; however, a handful of senators are holding the bill hostage in committee. A cruel game to play considering we are entering into a recession and it appears to be a bad one.\n\n\n\n***\n##How you can help\n\n*If you or a friend or loved one is currently struggling with the UIA please contact the nine senators in the committee that\u2019s currently holding House Bill 5265 hostage.*\n\n[Don\u2019t forget to pass this info on to everyone you know.](https://old.reddit.com/r/MichiganNews/comments/twhmbr/michigan_unemployment_overpayment_waiver_bill/) Remind them it takes a couple minutes to email all the senators and express your support, those few minutes could help out hundreds of thousands of Michiganders. \n\n\n**Subject:** House Bill 5265 waiver\n\n\n*(Copy and paste this list of email addresses into your email to send it to all senators on the committee.)*\n\n**To:**\n\nsenkhorn@senate.michigan.gov, sencvanderwall@senate.michigan.gov, sendlauwers@senate.michigan.gov, senwschmidt@senate.michigan.gov, senklasata@senate.michigan.gov, senmmacdonald@senate.michigan.gov, senmmcmorrow@senate.michigan.gov, senegeiss@senate.michigan.gov, senjmoss@senate.michigan.gov\n\n***\n##Individual Senator Contact Info\n\nLearn more about the senators on the committee. District information includes the cities, communities and zip codes served.

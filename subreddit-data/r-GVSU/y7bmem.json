I think they were having some sewer gas issues for a bit but that's probably been resolved.\n\nI used to like the big one in the basement of Kirkhoff too but that thing has been regularly clogged lately. Saw one in there today that was like straight red. If you took that poop and you're on here, you should def see a doctor like ASAP. Looked like dude was self-medicating with Ivermectin for horses and *seriously* got the dosage wrong.",

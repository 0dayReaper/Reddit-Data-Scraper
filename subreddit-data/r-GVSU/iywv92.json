The meter maids constantly check the parking lots for parking passes, but it's more of a hassle to check to see if people have paid for pay-to-park and how much time they have left. It's also cheaper than paying hundreds for a parking pass.\n\nAnother option would be to drive to a Laker Line bus stop and ride that to campus.",

Used to park at copper beech and ride the bus sometimes. \n\nThen again you can probably still park at the gv liquor store connected to save a lot (or is it daily deals now?) or even the main st pub. I don't think anyone at main st would give a damn. Hell if ya wanna be super  safe park at taco bell and take a brisk walk to the stop. \n\nBest you really have is Meijer way out in standale and taking the 50. No possibility of a ticket there \n\nBut then again getting a few boots would be cheaper than a j lot pass. I didn't know id only be on campus one day a week, I woulda just paid for boots or tickets tbh.\n\nWhen I paid for the pass it was only 160 and that would have covered what? 5 tickets?",

A nice thing about discord is that people in the same voice chat can share their screen, and it allows us to do things like play jackbox or watch a movie together, or at the least hang out.   \n\n\nI know it doesn't replace real life interaction, and I definitely miss my friends too, but it is quite better than nothing!",

I will totally take all the shit stats majors want to throw at me if I missed something or fucked up the math, but something seems off.....\nEdit: I've been thinking about this ever since reading it and it does say the 123 is taken from the self assessments, the initial testing by GVSU, county testing, and random testing leads to their results.  So that could be why my numbers don't add up, the positive rate isn't JUST from the initial 2,200 tests.  I am still apprehensive though, mainly because of how they have worded the report, and from all the parties and lack of masks/social distancing I've seen among a small community here, that put everyone at risk of getting it.  I hope in the future they are more transparent and clear with their reporting.",

If the positive rate is high, it indicates that cases are probably being missed and more testing is needed. IIRC, 2.1% is inline with what the CDC says is a good rate for tracking.",

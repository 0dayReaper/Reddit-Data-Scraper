    "postText": "Hey everybody, I was a student at GVSU starting in the fall semester of 2017... I left after two semesters and decided to take a break from school. After one semester off I chose to return to school but at GRCC. I'm finishing my last semester at GRCC now and am planning on returning to GVSU for the winter semester, do I need to apply to GVSU again even though I was already a student there before? Thanks for any information :)",

Be sure to send your official GRCC transcript to GVSU at the end of the semester so those courses can be added to yourGVtranscript.",

I basically did the same thing as you, but I'm also in that online accelerated adult program. I haven't reapplied or anything, just told them I'm coming back I guess and they were like okay. YMMV.",

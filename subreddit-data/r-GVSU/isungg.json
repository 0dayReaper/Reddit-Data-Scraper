So I don\u2019t see Kent County doing anything about it and they wouldn\u2019t have much jurisdiction over the most problematic area anyway. In addition, Ottawa county has a rather conservative bend as opposed to Ingram, so I don\u2019t see them stepping in beyond some major catastrophe. And Allendale township is...well...Allendale Township. They seem more preoccupied about BLM written on the ground in chalk rather than Covid.",

So maybe the THOUSANDS of free random tests that on and off campus GVSU students are receiving, unlike the general population, are having an impact on the perceived concentration of cases?",

They told me that we HAVE to have school because then the students would be forced to close housing contracts or would still be living there.\n\nI mean, can't they sublease? If school is closed why would they be on campus? Isn't the amount of students on campus a big concern still? Many online only students still require the campus, myself included. Is it seriously the 18 year old \"adults\" who are to blame when they can't even be trusted by the government to smoke a cigarette?\n\nI just don't get it. I think people needing to shuffle the housing arrangements is worth not having this outbreak.... But apparently that's just me.",

Never said it's not bad but my entire point is it's still the college choosing to stay open and that really isn't a good trade off for a covid spike.\n\nFucking hate that sub idk why I go there. Real Michigan is worse but they're both trash. At least th GR sub can be really dope",

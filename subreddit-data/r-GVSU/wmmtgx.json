    "postText": " \n\n\\*\\*\\*Ottawa County to conduct major incident drill in Allendale\\*\\*\\*\n\nALLENDALE, Mich., Aug. 10, 2022 -- Dozens of law enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency medical service providers will converge at Grand Valley State University on Sunday for a simulation designed to train and prepare for major incident responses.\n\n**The large-scale drill will take place beginning at 1:30 p.m. near Lubbers Stadium.  Those living around the Allendale area may hear sirens throughout the afternoon hours.  There is no need to worry.**  \n\nLocal hospitals will be participating in the exercise by simulating how they would respond to a large-scale incident based upon the information received from the scene.\n\nThe event will also include volunteer actors who will help simulate a crisis event involving a large number of casualties. The exercise, co-hosted by Ottawa Medical Control Board Authority, Grand Valley State University and Ottawa County Emergency Management, is slated to conclude by 6 p.m.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the exercise is to develop the best capability in Ottawa County possible for responding to large-scale mass casualty incidents,\u201d said Lou Hunt, Ottawa County Emergency Management Director. \u201cWe are already confident in our first responders and medical professionals in Ottawa; they all know their jobs well, but this exercise tests coordination and efficiency across the disciplines as they work together.\"\n\nHunt said the simulation itself will be an important exercise, but the lessons learned from the day will be invaluable for future training.  \n\u201cOur best measurement of success will be a comprehensive after-action report that identifies where we need to grow, and we will then make the necessary changes,\u201d Hunt said.",

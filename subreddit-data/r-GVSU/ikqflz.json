    "postText": "TLDR: October 10 ceremony cancelled; April 2020 grads will have option to walk sometime in the future. \n\nThe email I received from the commencement admins:\n\n&gt;Due to the current conditions and public health requirements of the COVID-19 virus, Grand Valley State University must cancel the in-person commencement ceremony scheduled for October 10, 2020 at the Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The virus has taught us all about flexibility, and we ask for your understanding as we continue to alter plans and create new ones in the hopes we keep our community as safe as possible while remaining connected.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;April 2020 graduates will be invited to a future in-person ceremony, and we hope if this type of event is important to you that you and your supporters will be able to attend.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the meantime, reach out if we can assist you with what\u2019s next for you \u2013 either with educational programs or career services. Remember, you can always take part in the [Laker Lifetime Learning Commitment (L3).](https://www.gvsu.edu/l3/)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you for being an important part of our Laker community.",

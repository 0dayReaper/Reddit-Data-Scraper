I have a venus flytrap that I want to find a new home for because it's been slowly dying and I wanted to see if anyone could take it and maybe try to revive it before I completely give up on it. My friend at a different uni said her biology department takes unwanted plants from students and revives them so I wasn't sure if ours does here?",

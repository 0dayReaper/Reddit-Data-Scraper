    "postText": "Good afternoon everyone, \n\nI'm going to be attending GVSU this fall and I've qualified for the work study program so I've been looking at on campus jobs. Note, I do understand that this program in itself helps you pay for your college tuition, but I can't believe the external pay is only $9/$10. Like many of the campus dinning jobs that are posted on Handshake like Starbucks, Panda Express, etc. has an estimated such a low hourly wage. Is it true that you only make $9/$10 an hour?",

We provide all of the training and necessary skills that you would need to work the job. It\u2019s a good on-campus job to have overall and usually pays a little bit higher than most of the other on-campus jobs. If you would like any more information about the job, etc, feel free to lmk!",

Pressure GV to drop Aramark and bring back the chain restaurants that students voted off campus more than a decade ago. Student workers are mostly funded by government grants - Aramark isn't going to raise wages or quality of food if it means spending more than the grant money and dipping into profits. April 6, 2021 there was a protest about this, you need to keep doing that, but with more than the measly 50+ people that showed last time - and not at the clock tower - do it in Zumberg where the president hides.",

There used to be 5 housing desks on the allendale campus but they shut down three to cut costs. They assured us that we would not lose our hours. I went from 25 hours a week to 8. My position was very low stress, which could almost justify the low pay. I cannot imagine the pressure that campus dining employees are under for so little money.",

Also check out the library's knowledge market, the writing center, career center, and speech lab. Those jobs usually have skills that are transferrable for after school and are low stress. For higher pay you'll have to go offcampus.",

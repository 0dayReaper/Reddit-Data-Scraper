It's a way to vent when we feel like we have nothing else we can do, other than demand everyone else stop being an idiot, wear their masks, wash their hands, and stay away from each other, as well as demand that the school get their shit together. We express our fears through posts and others comment to show that they feel the same way. It helps us feel that even on a campus where no one appears to care, at least someone else out there gives a fuck.",

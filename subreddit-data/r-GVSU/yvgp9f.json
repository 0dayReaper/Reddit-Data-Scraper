    "postText": "So I\u2019m looking for roommates and an off campus house for next year. I\u2019ve tried Facebook and there are 2 GVSU housing groups but one of them is overrun by spam and bots and the other is private and I haven\u2019t been let in even though it\u2019s been like 2 weeks so I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s not being used that much anymore or the admins are just AFK. Are there any other apps/websites I can use to try to get in contact with potential roommates?",

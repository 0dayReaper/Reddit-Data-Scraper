    "postText": "Hey howdy folks, i\u2019ve noticed that the clock tower seems to be chiming 2 mins early every time it plays. I\u2019ve crosschecked this with a few other folks and all of our clocks say, for example, 1:13 when the carillon goes off. Any explanation as to why this is happening? Or the history behind it if it\u2019s intentional? This question has been plaguing me since I first heard the bells ring.",

            "comment": "Ideally, the Carillon (the clock tower) should chime at 1:15, 1:30, 1:45, and then a longer play on the hour. The timing could be off, or they may be trying to adjust it for Tues/Thurs classes that don't all meet on the hour. \n\nThe Carillon is a mystery to most of us. Sometimes there are concerts, sometimes it acts like a grandfather clock. It's always up to something. It's ALLLLLLLLLLLIVE!!!\n\nJust kidding. It's a musical instrument and sometimes it is just off \\*\\*shrug\\*\\*",

There is nobody in the tower unless they are putting on a concert or practicing on the real unit.  (the practice unit is actually inside the music building in a rather small practice room.)\n\nThe chimes you hear on the hour and every 15 minutes are done by a timer. I'm not 100% sure on this next part, but I believe the 2 minute time difference is due to when it played the entire Westminster Quarters melody and then does the chimes to represent to he hour. I think those together ends when the final chime is played.  \n\nMost clocks that play the Westminster quarters melody and hour chimes start exactly at the quarter of hours. Not two minutes prior.  Its however been that way at GVSU for as long as i have noticed it maybe 2 and a half years ago.",

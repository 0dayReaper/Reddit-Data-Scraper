They all mainly look like this with more or less pipes.  \n\nAlthough one tunnel had a small, single room on the side.  It had one desk in the center of the room with a single hanging light bulb.  Something out of a horror movie if you ask me!\n\nEdit: Here's [another picture] (http://i.imgur.com/qrMjjkx.jpg?1)",

When I told her they were not available for student use, she was surprised because apparently when she was looking at Grand Valley when she was in high school, the tunnels were advertised for walking through when it got too cold. Anybody ever hear anything similar?",

I bring shame upon this university. \n\nEDIT: They'll also have a student-accessible tunnel between Padnos &amp; the new science building once it's completed. ",

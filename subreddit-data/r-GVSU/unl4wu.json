If you turn 18 on November 8, 2022 or before, you are safe to register to vote right now (May 8, 2022 was six months out from election day).\n\nQ: Can I register to vote if I am on parole or have a felony record?\n\nA: Yes! MI does not bar current parolees or former felons from voting. For more information about how incarceration could affect voting in MI, check out the ACLU of MI [here](https://www.aclumich.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/2020_faq_on_voting_by_people_in_criminal_justice_final.pdf).\n\nQ: If I have to go into my local clerk's office to register, how do I do that?\n\nA: Search for your local clerk's address [here](https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/Voter/Index/#yourclerk). Call their office, ask what to bring.  If you don't have a MI Driver's License or MI State ID, you can generally use one of the following: Current utility bill; Bank statement; Paycheck or government check; or Other government document.\n\nQ: How do I request an absentee ballot?\n\nA: Ask your local clerk (find their number [here](https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/Voter/Index/#yourclerk)) or use [this link](https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/AVApplication/Index) after May 19, 2022.\n\nQ: If I have more questions about voting, who should I contact?\n\nA: Your local clerk.

I don't even think professors get paid over a max of 75k a year and a salary that high is very rare. That's what schools psychiatrists make, not usually teachers. There are salaries as low as 20k a year at gvsu as well (more on the lower end than high end) . It should even out to an average of around 40k (if not closer to 30k) - nearly what each average student spends in total at gvsu a year. Does not include text books and other expenses. \n\nKnowing how many students there are vs employed personnel... Well it looks like there is an insane amount of surplus\n\nReally makes you wonder what the higher ups are paying themselves... Oh that's right, over 200k a year for some fucking reason. [Edit oh I misspoke. Some get paid nearly 500k ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GVSU/comments/hfcnr6/president_of_gvsu_gets_paid_480000_a_year_but)\n\nIf you want to jump into maintenance, well I blame gvsu for jumping on so many construction endeavors if they couldn't afford them without extra money laying around in case of emergency. Disgusting to me they basically redid all of Allendale within the last 6 years and can't afford to cut tuition costs this one year. \n\nIt's a multi million dollar university. They should have been prepared. Now students are being fucked over and told \"no cut the university some slack they just aren't good with money ha ha it's only your tuition that's being ruined\"\n\nI feel like a lot of you guys are not grasping how much you are actually paying whether its because you have someone else paying it or don't yet realize how massive the loans required are.\n\n2 semesters of loans is literally a years salary for so many people.",

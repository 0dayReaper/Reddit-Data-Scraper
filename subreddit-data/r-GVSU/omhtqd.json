    "postText": "Hey guys! I\u2019ve seen people using a stylus and taking notes on an ipad/tablet in some of my classes, was wondering if anybody here does that and what their opinion on it is? I struggle to make my notes organized and actually helpful but some of the apps I\u2019ve seen where you can hand write with a stylus and then it formats it for you seem incredibly helpful. Does it actually help? What\u2019s your opinion?",

            "comment": "Faculty POV: Note taking on tablets is a lot less common with my students than I'd expect especially given the all-digital approach of the last year. But for those who use those tools, they seem helpful, and the end product looks good and is easy to share e.g. on Blackboard or with email attachments. I encourage people to try these tools if they have access to the hardware. \n\nGoodNotes seems to be the iOS tool of choice. For Android tablets or Chromebooks, there still aren't a lot of great options but Squid is probably the best. \n\nThe one downside of these tools is that they can sometimes be fussy trying to get them to work. I personally still prefer to do handwritten work on paper and then scan the results to PDF -- paper never runs out of batteries or drops a wifi connection at a crucial moment. \ud83d\ude02",

            "comment": "I purchased an iPad last year and it was honestly one of the greatest purchases I\u2019ve made. I always liked to write out my notes on paper because I felt I would remember the content a little better opposed to typing. So, the combination of having the option to hand write my notes while not wasting paper was something I could not pass up.\n\nI use GoodNotes and I don\u2019t have anything bad to say about it. It\u2019s a great application overall and easy to use.\n\nIf you like the feel of writing your notes out on paper, I would recommend purchasing a \u201cpaper\u201d screen protector. It gives the sensation of writing on paper rather than the slick surface of your iPad which can be difficult at times. I have a Paperlike screen protector, but there are some pretty good dupes on Amazon you can find for less than half the price.\n\nI hope this helps!",

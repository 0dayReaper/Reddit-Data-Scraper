I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t pass which will put me a full year behind in graduation. What is the minimum passing grade if it\u2019s a required course for my major?",

            "comment": "If you plan on taking BMS 251 after 250, then I think the bare minimum is a C (74%+) or a B (84%+). This is because some of the material in BMS 251 stacks on top of BMS 250 so they want to make sure you have a decent understanding. \n\nIf you need help feel free to DM me for tips. Lab for me was harder than lecture, but both required lots of studying. You can bounce back up to get a C or B! Don\u2019t stress too much, and ATTEND office hours!! Instructors are always happy to help with further clarification if you go out of your way to seek help. :)",

I believe technically a passing is a D for the school (combined lab and lecture grade) but it can be higher if your major requires if. For example, I need a C for my program to accept me.",

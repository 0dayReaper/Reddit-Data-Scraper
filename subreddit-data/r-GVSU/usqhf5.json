I do have experience with programming, calculus, and chemistry from high school, though. Does anyone have any recommendations or suggestions for me?",

I can\u2019t speak on MTH 201 since I took that in high \nschool, but i took CHM 115 the same semester that i took 162 and didn\u2019t think it was too bad. though for 115, i would definitely check out the ratemyprofessor ratings for your prof because there are some pretty awful 115 profs",

I also have a few questions about how things worked out for you...\n\nDid you go into CIS 162 with Java programming experience, or did you have experience with another programming language? (I took a year of AP Computer Science Principles in high school, and they only covered JavaScript, not Java). Also, did you take another math class at the same time as taking CHM 115 and CIS 162?",

You could prolly do compsci and either math or sci  but I would spread the third out over a semester. \n\n\nIf you do all 3 make sure you hit up tutoring the second you do bad on a hw or test or whatever bc you won\u2019t be able to catch back up if you wait too long. Especially in calc if you didn\u2019t take ap calc. I missed like 2 calc classes and was lost for weeks lol.",

I am also thinking of taking GEO 111 instead of CHM 115, since CHM 115 isn't required for a computer science major (even though I'm pretty sure it's required for an engineering major).",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve taken all those classes so I know from experience how and what others have done in those classes grade wise. \n\n- CIS 162: if you have experience programming in Java then you should be fine. If not then start learning it right now on YouTube or something. For first time programmers it can be a lot. I\u2019ve seen plenty of kids drop out of that class because it is a weeder class meant to weed out the weak ones. It is project heavy so plan on spending the bulk of your time on projects. If you do take it, take it with Professor Posada. She knows her stuff and is a wonderful professor. \n\n- CHM 115: I was in this class for 4 weeks before I dropped it and never looked back again. It was so hard that I bowed never to touch a flask or talk about atoms and stuff ever again. I took chemistry in high school during my sophomore year and I thought it was easy but this class was just too much for me. Do your self a favor and take Geology 111 easiest Gen Ed ever and it covered the requirement that chemistry would have. \n\n- MTH 201: this class was actually very insightful. I enjoy math and have even taken the computer math logic courses of MTH 225 and 325 along with Pre Calc 124 and MTH 110 which is Algebra. The calculus class is very writing intensive. You might write proofs depending on the professor and overall it was actually very enjoyable. If you take it with Professor Talbert he has a mastery ranked system which is a lot better than your regular grading system. So you would have checkpoints every two weeks with learning targets and you needed a certain amount of them to be able to get a A, B, C, ETC. but the catch is that you could get an M for mastered, P for progressing, and X for not yet. Depending on how many of those letters you had would determine your grade. You could also retry checkpoints up to 3 times so failing Talberts class was almost impossible unless you didn\u2019t care tbh. \n\nOverall I would suggest swapping CHM 115 for GEO 111 since GEO 111 is SOO much easier. Trust me, why would you make it harder on yourself when there\u2019s an easier class. If you do decide to switch look for Professor Vanregenmorter or Professor Winklestern. Those two professors are the best!\n\nHope you like GVSU!!!\n\nAlso someone also mentioned tutoring and I highly recommend doing that. I would get a tutor for CIS 162 and MTH 201. The tutors I had were amazing and helped me a ton so please please get a tutor for those classes and you\u2019ll be alright!",

Also, what year did you take MTH 201? Since I will be taking it in my freshman year, it will be my first math class at GVSU. I do have experience with algebra, pre-calc, and calculus from high school though, but I'm just not too sure about how much of a change in difficulty it will be for me.",

                            "comment": "Trust me, I thought 201 was somewhat hard but CHM 115 was way beyond what I could ever handle. Plus, who's gonna care if you take CHM over GEO? I had a ton of fun in GEO 111 from touching and playing with the minerals/rocks anyways over memorizing a stupid elements chart.\n\nBut to the question, I took MTH 201 my Sophomore year. Technically my third year but I didn't actually qualify as a Junior yet because of my credits but that class I can't really compare to HS as I never took it in HS. From what I have noticed however about math classes including stats from high school to college is that the college courses are a lot easier. In HS I barely passed Algebra with a D- and in college I turned it around and got an A. Pre-Calc MTH 124 IMO was much more time consuming and demanding than MTH 201 Calculus but what I can say is that both classes focus extensively on writing in math if that makes sense. I think if you just allocate your time accordingly then you shouldn't do bad at all. If you believe you can do it than you can do it. I would always do your hw on time, daily activities, etc before the deadline. If you study and do that then you will pass with an A. I'm pretty dumb when it comes to math and I got a B+ in Calculus which I am genuinely proud of. You can do it. But DROP CHM 115 if you don't want to be overloaded with assignments because I could never do CHM 115, CIS 162, and MTH 201 along with another course. I'd probably fail tbh.",

            "comment": "CHM 115 is based around the assumption that you\u2019ve had experience in chemistry before. There are prerequisites that your professor will not cover because it\u2019s assumed that your high school covered them. Make sure you understand how to perform gram to mole to particle conversions, how to determine molar mass and use it in conversions, how to balance chemical equations, and basic metric conversions (this came directly from my professor\u2019s Blackboard).\n\nI will say that CHM 115 is a weed-out class and if it is not part of your major, I would take something else (I am a Chemistry minor and I struggled at times). If you have to take this class and you aren\u2019t confident in those prerequisites, consider taking CHM 109 or CHM 100 before taking CHM 115. They will give you all the prerequisite knowledge you need and they\u2019re pretty easy classes if you get a good professor.\n\nIf you do take any CHM course, be sure to take advantage of the Chemistry Tutoring Center. They do video calls through Blackboard and can help you on homework questions, pre-lab questions, etc.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions, I just took CHM 115 last semester.",

Someone else mentioned GEO 111, do you think that might be a better/easier option for me?",

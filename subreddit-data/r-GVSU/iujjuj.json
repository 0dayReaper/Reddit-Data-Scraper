    "postText": "Email sent to Student Employee Supervisors: \n\nStudent employees are allowed and encouraged to continue working on campus so long as they pass their self-assessment each day and are not asked to quarantine or isolate per guidance from health officials. Since offices on campus remain open and our student staff are essential to those office functions, their employment can continue. **In essence, student employees should continue working as usual and their hours or participation within their hiring department should not be changed by this new order.** We do however still encourage students to stay at home when they are not working, attending class, seeking medical care, purchasing groceries/food, attending religious events or medically supervised athletic practice.",

I can only speak for myself, but I tell my students in typical semesters not to come in if they don't feel well in general. As student supervisors, we are also supposed to make sure students prioritize their schooling over their work. \n\nThe new Student Employment Plus (SE+) was also designed to help create work from home opportunities for students. \n\nBut like staff members, everything is dependent on the decision of your supervisor. Some of us have flexibility supervisors and some of us do not.",

Or allowing students to work so the departments they work for don't feel the crunch. There are some departments that rely heavily on student employees to get daily work done. Also, staff members (usually the ones working with students) are pretty low in the food chain so who cares if they get exposed  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af.",

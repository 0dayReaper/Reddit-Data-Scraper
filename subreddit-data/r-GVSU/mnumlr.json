    "postText": "This might be of interest to some: \n\nSign up this spring semester for ANT 315! It\u2019s a Gen Ed double-dipper (an Issues course (Identity) as well as a World Perspectives course) and it also counts toward the Anthropology major and minor and the Religious Studies minor. We normally offer it multiple times throughout the school year but it\u2019s there is only one section being offered in the spring and one section in the winter this time around. Professor Deana Weibel, an expert on religious pilgrimage, rituals and sacred objects, takes you around the world, learning about the large major religions, but also smaller ones that are less well known. You\u2019ll see patterns that link the religions of the world, understand significant differences among them (and reasons for those differences), and learn more about the religions of your own community too. The spring course (May 10th \u2013 June 23rd) \u00a0is hybrid, meeting in Allendale some Wednesdays at 12pm, with most of the coursework offered asynchronously online. The CRN is 40042.",

Not a total expert on this, but this is the info I do have: If you plan to live on campus next semester, this will appear as a credit for next semester's housing bill, not as a refund. If you are not living on campus next semester, refunds are being processed today. \n\nFor questions, it's best to contact student accounts, not housing, as housing will not have specific info on the refund request. Hope that helps a bit!",

Good job bitching to student accounts everyone!",

I would understand a little more if they gave this info out in their email. Thank you though.",

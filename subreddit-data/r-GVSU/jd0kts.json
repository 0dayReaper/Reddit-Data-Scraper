    "postText": "My (online-only) teacher sent this doc with some terms to know for our test, which I expected. But then she mentioned there's also like a short essay listening portion? I imagine we just have to hear a minute or so of music and talk about some elements, but I'm worried about it being exceedingly complicated. If anyone has been in the class before I'd appreciate it, because if we're still analyzing music on Blackboard I imagine it might be a similar experience when in-person.",

My Gen 2 iPad is way too old",

The fire table 7 is smaller but around only $50, which is definitely on the cheaper side of tablets and would do what you need it to do. They can\u2019t do as much as an iPad but are fine for books",

I've written many papers on my iPad (external keyboard, of course). The base kindle fire is much cheaper, but is as slow as a 2010-era android tablet (I've got the Fire 7, and it's nearly unusable).",

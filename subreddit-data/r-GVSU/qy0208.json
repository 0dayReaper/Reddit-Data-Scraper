I am in between going here or out of state where it is double the tuition. the main aspect holding me back is the general negative opinions surrounding gvsu. (and I am by no means saying this is true or believing it) for example I hear about everyone dropping out because it sucks its boring, the environment is toxic, I have even heard someone say it is a glorified high school. if anyone would please share their honest opinion about this I would very much appreciate it :))",

            "comment": "I would describe it more as a mixed bag. There are a lot of things I didn't like there was a lot of things I loved. I loved the campus, it's really beautiful and once you get a sense for it, easy to navigate. I loved the library, I loved the proximity to GR, if you like hiking there are some decent nature spots nearby. Most of my professors were pretty cool, all the ones I didn't like were older and clearly didn't care anymore. \n\nThe GVSU community is kind of a weird mix. Allendale is pretty conservative from what I know but being a college and also being near GR the student body has very mixed political views, which on one hand can be seen as good cuz diverse views, on the other hands I've had bad experiences with students getting in seriously heated debates in class. Then, some of the housing is not in the most convenient spot, laker village is annoyingly far from the package center, I never minded on nice days but on not so nice days it sucks. But that is better than if you have a meal plan, because in my time at Gvsu the connection which is the closest place to laker village to eat, either was shut down completely or had very limited meals compared to the rest. Then I also had issues with the rigidity of my curriculum, that will depend on your major but I was pretty annoyed by the lack of relevance the internship I had to do was to me because the career path I wanted is not usual for my major. \n\nThe bigger issues I have with GVSU are issues you are gonna find at most universities. The leadership at Gvsu clearly is more concerned about what patrons think than students and clearly values them more. Another big thing is that during the height of the pandemic they raised tuition by a not insignificant amount. I'm sure they felt the effects of the pandemic, but students did too, so raising the tuition on top of that did not make many students happy.\n\nAnother thing I've heard people complain about is making friends at Gvsu. People definitely like to stay in their group bubbles, as a transfer student I found did find looking for friends little unapproachable. But I've heard freshman have an easier time because most people don't have their friend groups yet. \n\nAll that being said, I don\u2019t at all regret going. I miss being there sometimes cuz it's just a very friendly, beautiful, and engaging environment. Every University is gonna have it's downsides, I wouldn\u2019t skip out on GV.",

            "comment": "If you're asking for honest opinions, I've never heard those complaints about GV.  At least, I've never heard complaints about GV that are not true of other universities generally.  I guess there is slight toxicity around being a conservative area but it's by no means pressured on you as a student.  A lot of people don't like the current president of the university which is reasonable but I doubt the people you talked to are talking about toxicity with regards to her.\n\nPeople dropping out because it sucks, it's boring, it's toxic, it's like high school?  I am a high school teacher and these complaints honestly seem like the kind of complaints high schoolers who don't actually care about their education or just don't like learning have.  I'd be willing to bet they're dropping out because they can't handle university not because it \"sucks\".\n\nIt's nothing like high school except the class sizes, which is a good thing.  I have rarely ever been genuinely bored in classes.  Classes are quite rigorous depending on the subject.  Even intro classes analogous to AP classes in high school are more encompassing and educational than those AP classes.  I, very honestly, had/have fun learning in a lot of my classes.\n\nIf you think it is going to \"suck\", just go out of state.  I'm getting the vibe that you don't really want to go to GV anyway.  Go somewhere you actively want to go.",

I loved to visit my kid but we always left the area to go somewhere else to go out to eat or to do something. Allendale is not very impressive, in my opinion. My kid felt that the education that they received was great but they were beyond happy to move away from that area. It also tends to be a very conservative county. Also, their approach to Covid has been a joke in my opinion. Inferior to what other universities have done.\nEdited to add\u2026having the least debt possible is so important. That should be heavily considered. Proximity to Grand Rapids and the lake are huge bonuses.",

I remember hearing those complaints, but I also remember them being from people who stayed on campus or in their apartment complex in Allendale the whole time. \n\nGV is a very short (and free) bus ride to one of the nicest downtowns in the state, with all kinds of stuff to do: food, bars, sports, music, parks, art, shopping, etc. There's tons of nature and hiking around, and the best beaches in Michigan are 35 minutes to the west. Your time in college, no matter where you go, is really what you make of it. Grand Valley has a nice, modern campus with good teacher-student ratio and lots of extracurricular opportunities. \n\nI'd also factor in how COVID has impacted things. For a year, it took away almost everything that makes going to college a great experience. Things are getting back to normal, but I'm sure people were frustrated with paying all that money just to quarantine in their room all year. Hope this helps, let me know if you have any other specific questions I, an old-timer, can maybe answer.",

I\u2019ve had a few professors that weren\u2019t my favorite but the majority of my professors were good or even great and I purposely took certain professors multiple times because I liked them so much. If you can I would try to live in one of the newer dorms your freshman year. I lived in holton hooker which I think is the newest and it has air conditioning which many dont. And it was super nice and new. Some of the older dorms are pretty small and don\u2019t have AC. Niemeyer is apartment style and also has AC I believe. GV may not have handled the pandemic perfectly but I don\u2019t think there were any easy choices and they redistributed a lot of the money they got from the federal government to students. I\u2019ve gotten like $2,200 back from the university from the Covid funds the government gave them. Also I\u2019ve made some amazing friends here! I would definitely spend some time in a Facebook group getting to know people before you decide to live with them. There should be a gvsu class of ____ for whatever year you graduate on Facebook. I met my roommates on Facebook as a freshman and we are still great friends four years later. I would definitely recommend anyone to come to grand valley",

Then I moved off campus with those friends for two years and while it wasn't as exciting as the campus lifestyle, we still enjoyed living close by and having more freedoms than before. I'm now student teaching through the College of Education (fantastic major btw, especially special education) so I spend all my time in GR and I'm living downtown with some different friends I've made through GVSU. While I miss the old lifestyle I had, I'm appreciating everything that GR has to offer. The systemic issues are all I would fault Grand Valley for, but you're gonna find that at most universities. It's just upper-level administration stuff. \n\nI should also add that the student support systems on campus are great. I've checked out the counseling office, gone through disability support and the academic success center, used the food pantry during more recent tough times, and had GVPD respond well to emergency situations on campus. They're truly serving students to the best of their ability.",

            "comment": "I graduated in August and would say the pre-pandemic and during pandemic experiences were really different but that GVSU is starting to hit its stride. Pre-pandemic was a very vibrant experience, especially if you were involved in campus activities. I think being involved in student activities really shapes the experience. As a local I lived off campus and I still was able to make a reasonable amount of friends through my classes, research activities, and club/event participation. The range of options for involvement to pick from is huge, and is really up to you how involved you are or are not. I would imagine the greek life is probably very high school like, but I have no experience with that. From what I saw there wasn't an unreasonable amount of high school behavior in what I participated in, and I attended all sorts of campus events and club meetings that were related to my interests. \n\nI took upper level courses in 3 different majors and I think the program you are in really shapes the academic/class experience you get. I had friends in other majors that had really lackluster experiences but I overall found my professors engaging and understanding. They seem to be adjusted to the virtual platform, although there is absolutely a range of varying skill in class construction for online classes. I attended a variety of student support and scholarly programs and made connections with staff and faculty that have been invaluable for networking as a graduate and for furthering education and career goals. I also have friends who were in the same programs who tried to skate by on the bare minimum in classes and involvement who are worried as they approach graduation because they didn't apply themselves or network. \n\nThe GVSU alumni network is far reaching and I have encountered job opportunities in several of the previous states I lived in prior to attending that I was given solely because I grew up in proximity to the area. After graduation I interviewed at over 20 different companies in the area before finding an offer that furthered my goals and at least half of those were with alumni. So if you're planning to stay in the area that may be a benefit; overall GVSU has a pretty positive reputation in west Michigan and the resources it offers for career support are beneficial post-graduation even if you never utilize the career center, handshake, or the job fairs that are regularly held.",

Maybe in specific studies it can feel like \"glorified high school\" but I can assure you, mathematics and statistics classes are on par with regular university studies.\n\nAs for \"boring\" - I would imagine that those students don't have a passion to learn and simply wanted a degree.  Maybe they haven't found their field of study most suitable to their liking?  I'm not sure, but far too vague to take seriously.\n\nMy overall take is GVSU is a wonderful school, with small enough classes that you can build a good relationship with a professor but large enough where you have diverse options for classes.  I loved the professors I've had and have truly learned an ungodly large amount about programming, mathematics, and statistics.  The rigor is perfectly balanced of challenging, but not impossible.  Anyone can succeed, as long as they're not lazy.\n\nThe major downside I see is more personal - that I'm not the most fond of the COVID protocols implemented by the university (vaccine mandate particularly) but I don't see that as a large enough issue (and outside of my personal taste) to dissuade someone from coming here.\n\nHopefully that's helpful to you in your decision! Maybe contacting some professors in your preferred field of study would also be beneficial!",

But in my opinion it had enough to keep me entertained and the accessibility to professors and their support as opposed to a giant school where professors are more focused on research than their students was one of the main reasons I chose Grand Valley and was very glad I did. So if you are looking for a place that will enable you to have fun while getting a degree on the side and be able tell stories of the college parties and football games, you can have that there but you have to search it out a bit more and it might not be the scale you want but in terms of education you have a good chance of getting more support than at other colleges in my opinion.",

The campus itself is beautiful, especially in the fall, and many of the buildings on campus arent more than 30 years old. Class sizes tend to be small, even for freshman courses, and every class is taught by a professor. I will say, though, the campus is basically dead on the weekends, and theyre isnt anything to do in Allendale besides drink. Everyone moves off campus after freshman year to off campus housing, which is ran by like the same 4 companies. Parties get shut down pretty quickly as the allendale police dont have much else to worry about. Moreover if you plan to major in engineering, nursing, business, youre going to have classes downtown, and by your senior year all your classes will be downtown. \n\nI dont know what you plan on majoring in, but im majoring in engineering, and i am seriously disappointed with the engineering college at GV. Many of the professors are underqualified and the academic resources available are poor. Throw on a mandatory Co-op experience and it makes it very difficult to graduate in 4 years.",

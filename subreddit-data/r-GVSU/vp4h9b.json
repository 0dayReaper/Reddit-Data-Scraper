    "postText": "Hi guys! I am looking to take EDF 260 this Fall, but I was wondering if you guys could comment on the difficulty level. Its a research class so I am expecting a lot of work, but I am also in marching band, so I am trying not to take a class with a TON of, like, excessive writing and reading during this semester. Any perspectives on anyone who has taken the class would be appreciated. It is taught by Wei Gu",

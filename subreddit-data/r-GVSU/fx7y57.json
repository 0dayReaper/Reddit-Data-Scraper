    "postText": "Textbook is a nearly new Minecraft server that is solely for university students. It is meant to be a tight-knit vanilla server with zero add-ons and a close attention to a classic Minecraft experience. Our goal is to have a fun community of people who love Minecraft and play regularly or semi-regularly. This is a Java server.\n\nMake some new friends on this server. We already have hundreds of players!\n\nWe have just recently started (about two weeks ago or so), so check us out. This is a link to our Discord server. Now is the perfect time to join.\n\n[https://discord.gg/N2unAV8](https://discord.gg/N2unAV8)\n\nStay healthy out there, practice social distancing, and make sure to take it easy once in a while!",

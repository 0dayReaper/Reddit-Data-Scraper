I transferred in as a junior and went to the business school downtown, Pew Campus, so I lived directly downtown. I had to commute out to Allendale for one or two classes and it\u2019s not bad. About a 30 minute drive. Winters can be annoying as it\u2019ll be longer, but many students take the bus and depend on that to go back and fourth.\n\nEdit: chose GVSU as my school because of the smaller class size, yet still challenging coursework. Both campuses are beautiful. You\u2019re 30 minutes or less from Lake Michigan. GR is a cool city to spend time in as its growing everyday.",

Theres the freshman dorms (north campus freshman land basically), south campus apartments, niemeyer apartments, Grand Valley Apartments (small), Laker Village (kinda like townhomes). If your looking off campus theres ton of options that can be easily cheaper than on campus. Also depends if you have a car and what your budget it. Feel free to ask more questions, ill try and answer them:)",

            "comment": "As someone who uses the bus system, the bus between GR and Allendale is actually pretty reliable and saves a ton on parking. It comes every 6 minutes, and I was lucky enough to have that bus go to my school, work, and home. I lived downtown on the West Side and I never drove to either campus. In 4 years, I didn't pay a thing for transport.   \n\n\nLiving on campus can be a little more difficult bus-wise and car-wise, because you have to pay for parking and there are more buses to get between all the different spots, so it takes more time. Living on campus is also pretty expensive- when I was considering it I realized I would be paying $900 for the room alone, when you can find tons of places on the West Side for $500. It all depends on the type of experience you're looking for, but it's for sure cheaper to live off campus.",

My routine is to try and schedule my first class in downtown GR, where I park my car. Then once I need to go to Allendale I take the 50 to save my own gas and my energy (from driving myself there). Depending on the time of day, I find it easier to park downtown. Getting a good space in Allendale can be competitive which is another reason why I prefer parking downtown.",

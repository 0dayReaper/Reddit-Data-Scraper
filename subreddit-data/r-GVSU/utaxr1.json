You needed to take a major specific version of Calc 2 if you wanted a snowball's chance in hell at passing because the math major version was proof based, although it was assumed that every student knew how to do proofs from high school (they did not.) At that school curves were used as they were supposed to be--to make grades meaningful. An 'A' does not mean 'superior' if everyone can earn one in every class.\n\nBy lack of rigorous standards, I mean to highlight the fact that the CS department requires Speech as a class in order TO EVEN APPLY FOR SECONDARY ADMISSION TO THE MAJOR. Whereas the school I graduated from many years ago has one of the most competitive Computer Science Graduate programs IN THE WORLD (top ten, actually) and there are no requirements for speech to join the major. But you know what is a requirement for CS there? Logic. Students will graduate from GVSU and not know how to solve basic derivations, have no exposure to the ideas of bondage and scope, theory of relations, or modal logic. None of the students in my computer science classes have any formal exposure to symbolic logic (you know, the discipline that spawned Computer Science)--but they have to sit through 14 weeks of what amounts to a Dale Carnegie Seminar because some overpaid Administrator was visited by the good idea fairy decades ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe administrators of this school want to turn it into a Community College, and we should resist that. Instead of building more buildings, let's hire better faculty, stop raising tuition, raise our standards for admission, cut Administrative executive salaries across the board by 50%, and unionize all workers.",

    "postText": "I haven't had a car all semester so I never bought a semester pass. I'm bringing up a car for the last few weeks. I live on the allendale campus. \n\nThey won't pro-rate the pass and are saying the only thing to do is buy $10 day passes. Anyone have a better solution? \n\nI just bought the car so I only have a temp tag and I figured that if I don't put it up in the window how would they ticket me? Any advice is appreciated.",

            "comment": "That\u2019s a tough situation. You could risk just not putting the pass out but I\u2019m not sure what they would do. Parking is free after 6:30 and free on the weekends so you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it on the weekends or the evenings at least. Do you have any friends in off campus apartments? There\u2019s guest parking at most of the complexes. You could park in one of those lots. Some of them have free open guest parking and some of the complexes you\u2019ll need a friend to give you a parking pass. Then you could take the bus (37 or 48)to that complex and grab your car when you need it. Not great but better than paying $150 to park for three weeks. I know most of the parking policies for the off campus apartments if there\u2019s a specific one you\u2019d want to park at. Also, you could park at meijer or something and take the laker line. Also not ideal but free",

I probably got a friend that lives in each one of them.\n\nEdit: when I talked to a parking person they said to just risk getting the tickets but my issue is the car is very conspicuous, so it would only work once.",

As long as it\u2019s not inside the gate it\u2019s free and no permit needed or anything, and you can park overnight. At 48 west there are guest lots and there is also a guest parking pass that you would need a friend to lend you. Not sure if that\u2019s changed but that\u2019s how it was when I lived there two years ago. In campus view you will just need a friend to print out parking passes for you and then you can park anywhere and put the pass on your dash. They might need to print a new one every day. At the Trio complexes you would need a friend to give you a pass to hang on your rear view. I will caution that off campus apartments put a barnacle on your window that\u2019s very expensive to remove, so if you don\u2019t have the proper pass then it\u2019s pricey so just make sure you\u2019ve done the guest parking properly and have the right pass/are in the right place etc",

But sometimes they check and it\u2019s fine. I\u2019d put it up and take a picture of it on the window so you can prove it was there if they try and ticket you. If you don\u2019t put it on the window and they ticket you, you probably won\u2019t have a whole lot of luck disputing it.",

It\u2019s a shame that comments on that post were locked. \n\nJust food for thought.",

We all signed up for the myChart thing, but is there anything else we\u2019re supposed to do? Seems kind of pointless to get tested here at GV if the turnaround time for results is 3+ days.\n\nEdit: Just called the hotline, and they said i should have my results in 3-5 DAYS FROM NOW. Do they not realize how dangerous that is? There is almost no point in wasting your time getting tested here if your results could take up to a week to come in.",

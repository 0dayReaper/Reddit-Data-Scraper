    "postText": "I have some FIT classes coming up and I have no idea how to get to the locker rooms to change and shower. I know where the rock climbing gym is, but there's so many entrances and ways to get around. I've never used the gym in all the years I've been here, except for a handful of times. Can anyone give advice? Or have a damn map? \n\nThank you in advance.",

You\u2019ll pass a pilates classroom, keep going down that hallway. When you get to the end of the hallway, where you\u2019ll overlook the free weight room, turn right again. Down this hallway there will be a mens, womens, and gender neutral/handicapped/family bathroom. All have showers and lockers!",

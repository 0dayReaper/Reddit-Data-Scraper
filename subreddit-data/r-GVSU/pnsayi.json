The problem with using that with GV, is you\u2019re uploading a picture of a forged medical document. It\u2019s an easy assumption that GV has access to the state database (even tho they probably shouldn\u2019t), so they can cross reference it. I cannot begin to imagine that a fake vaccine card would be worth risking the penalty when they\u2019re getting caught",

My entire career and education is based upon the science we use everyday to treat disease. I've taken multiple critical thinking courses, I have a Certificate in Medical and Health Humanities, and I just finished a 10 week critical thinking seminar course I took as an elective in which we discussed much of the same things being said in this thread.\nI never said the individual was misinformed for saying that his coworker had side effects. They were misinformed because they were implying that because their ONE coworker stated they had side effects that ALL people have side effects. Its a fallacy to assume something that allegedly happens to one person will happen to all people.\nLastly, I do not appreciate you attacking me for being a GVSU alumnus. I am very proud of my university; it has helped me find success in medical school and my career, made me more mature and open-minded, and allowed me to help others succeed as well.\nPlease make mature and well-informed arguments that can be backed up with empirical reasoning or take your toxicity to another subreddit.",

The seeds should\u2019ve been planted long before that. However, let\u2019s assume you did wait until college; if you believe that you are not able to learn to think critically in an academic environment because it is less competitive comparatively, you\u2019re mistaken once again. As an aside: you went to GV. You\u2019re implying that not only you didn\u2019t develop critical thinking skills here, but you will not (\u201cyou *went* to GV, that *won\u2019t* happen\u201d). Congratulations, you\u2019ve rendered your own argument useless. I agree that u/aberdeen800 could\u2019ve phrased this better (i.e., many people *do* experience side effects, but these are almost entirely immune responses that are actually a good sign. However, SEVERE side effects are extremely rare, and you\u2019re misinformed if you believe that they\u2019re so rampant it justifies not getting vaccinated).",

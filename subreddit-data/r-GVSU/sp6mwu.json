    "postText": "Hey guys! So as the title mentions im trying to move out as soon as I can and heard something about \u201cGVSU relet\u201d? Or something along those lines and was looking for more information on it. I know that it\u2019s when someone wants to pass their lease off and not break it but I don\u2019t know much more then that. But that sounds like what im after, so if anyone knows where I can learn more or find out how to get registered for that it would be much appreciated. Thanks!",

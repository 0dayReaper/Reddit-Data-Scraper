    "postText": "\nI have recently been really struggling with handling my depression, stress, and anxiety all on top of my huge school work load to the point that it's affecting me both physically and mentally. I am wondering, how I can ask my professors if they would be willing to provide their material a week in advance for me to learn/complete (all my classes are online) or to allow me to take a week off and submit assignments a week late? \n\nAny advice, especially from TAs, former/current professors, or university staff, would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "Faculty here. Just ask! Especially if you can present the professor with a plan for doing your work on an alternate schedule, just for one week, in a way that minimizes the amount of extra work that the prof has to do -- as opposed to just giving the prof a list of things you want -- I think it would be hard for a prof to say no to that. \n\nThinking of my own classes, if one of my MTH 201 students wanted to take the week of Oct 19-23 for a break, then what I'd like to see is: \n\n- The student has looked ahead in the schedule and made a note of what's due (rather than just saying they want a week off and haven't demonstrated that they've scouted ahead to see what that involves). \n- In our case, there are two preclass assignments due, two follow-up assignments, an online homework set, and a take-home exam during that week. (That week's a busy one.) The student could ask to have the first five of those to be available on Wednesday October 14 which is a happy middle ground between _immediately_ and too late to make a real difference. And maybe ask that the take-home exam could be turned in a couple of days later, rather than have it available a few days early. In our case, the pre-class and followup activities are already posted two weeks in advance, so this is easy for me to say \"yes\" to; I'd just need to think about all issues related to having an extended deadline for the test. \n- I'd also like to talk with that student about making sure to get appropriate mental health care. This stuff is serious, don't treat it like the common cold. \n\nTL;DR I think most professors would be more than happy to work with you on this as long as you're willing to do some legwork and propose something reasonable that we can say \"yes\" to. Don't underestimate the impression that it makes when a student has really taken initiative to help themselves before asking for help.",

I have no qualms about giving extensions, but I would hate to set the student up for a situation where they will be even more overwhelmed because now they have two weeks' worth of work to worry about. Solving the underlying issue so that the rest of the semester can be less stressful is key.",

If you're already working with someone there they'd likely be willing to help with the situation and provide some evidence to your professors if it's needed. If you're not working with someone I highly recommend calling them.",

I think your best option would be talking to counseling center. I\u2019m not sure if disability services would do anything in this situation. Some professors can be kind and understanding, but a week seems like a really tough sell... I think counseling center is your best bet. Best of luck!",

You can ask for a few days with assignments and explain why and see if that works. But other than that, you'd need to maybe talk to disability services and the counseling center. If taking a week break was a thing, I think alot of us would go for it. If you have a prof. Thats nice enough to allow it, they are rare and appreciated.",

One time we were walking back from my car late at night, and there was someone dressed up in a clown outfit with what looked like a bat on the basketball court behind Hooker (I lived in Maple). \n\nShe freaked out and started running around the other side of Hooker so i had to follow. Once she rounded the corner I stopped and looked back and I could just barely see him as he disappeared into the woods. \n\n100% just some dude fucking with people, but he did a great job.",

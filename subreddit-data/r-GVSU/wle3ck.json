Ethernet has always been top-notch for me with speeds well above 100 Mbps. (If I'm remembering right, it was closer to 160, but don't quote me on that).",

I grew up without any internet in my house until middle school and it is only towards the end of high school that my parents got high-speed internet close to the levels I can consistently get at GV. Don't even get me started on what is good for my grandparents.\n\nAre the rates I'm \"boasting\" about right now objectively top tier, no. However, we don't all need to be rocking a gig up and down for most of what is actually required at GV and gaming is still going to be rock solid. You aren't going to be able to download CP2077 in a minute of GV's connection, but you will never have to worry about a buffering video here.",

It\u2019s not about perspective or how you grew up or whatever, it\u2019s purely factual and objective. It\u2019s not a super deep concept and you don\u2019t need to spill your whole childhood explaining 100upload.",

    "postText": "Just asking for tips from students+alumni.  I heard the college fair was a good resource. I have applied to places every year but no luck. I do now have a unpaid internship credit under my belt in web development (front and backend). What should I be doing when I go to this career fair. I need to get a paid internship by winter semester",

Have multiple options I never knew existed. Very worth it. Literally walking out of a meeting right this second as I write this",

Its definitely a great learning experience though.  I would send my resume and cover letter out to everything on Linkedin, handshake, indeed, etc that you're interested in to have a better chance of landing something. \n\nAlso research companies in the area and apply directly on their sites. I believe going directly to their sites helps bypass some of the screening algorithms used on 3rd party sites.\n\nI believe I landed my old Steelcase internship by applying directly on their site.",

Also have a good relationship with your professors, some might open up more opportunities for you. \n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "I'm sure the university covers a lot of this in its prep sessions, but here are my top three:\n\n- One-page resume that is proof-read a dozen times. And maximize it for automatic resume readers (Google if you don't know what this is). Fancy designs are cool, but basic bullet points and keywords are most effective.\n- Take note of a few things you and the recruiter talked about (aspects of your resume, interests, commonalities). And make sure you get their name. You'll need this for your followup email.\n- Know what you want. Research the positions they have open/are advertising and talk about why you would be a good fit.\n\nI got an internship from the career fair and was a representative for my full-time company in 2019. Would be happy to chat about what I look for if you need some more help.\n\nGo Lakers!",

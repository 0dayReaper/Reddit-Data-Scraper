All this \"everything's gonna be fine soon\" news we see from governments and colleges is just propaganda. It's just \"don't leave us\" bait to keep our life debts in their pockets and not other's... such as dedicated (and regionally accredited) online universities that are set up to help students actually succeed in online learning.\nTo be frank, GVSU uses blackboard which is awful and is full of Hufflepuff faculty and staff that don't or won't adapt to anything other than what worked in the past (from what I'm learning about GVSU) and at this point I think anyone who has a better educational backup plan should absolutely take it. Trying to physically attend this university in fall 2020 is going to be a mess.",

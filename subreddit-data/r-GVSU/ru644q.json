The problem we're seeing with the Omicron variant is that it's much easier to transmit so more people are getting covid at the same time. \n\nThat's one of the reasons why so many flights have been cancelled in the past few weeks. So many airline staff members are out sick that there aren't enough staff members to run the flights.\n\nTo apply that to Grand Valley, what happens to an in-person class when a large number of students or a professor miss a week of instruction because they have to quarantine? What happens to our already under-staffed campus dining when a large number of employees call in sick?",

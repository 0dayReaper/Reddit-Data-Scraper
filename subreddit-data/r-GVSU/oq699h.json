Has anyone taken this class? Is it interesting or does anyone know of a class that fulfills my necessary criteria that was really interesting?",

Before relying on a triple dip like this, check with your professional advisor or faculty advisor to make sure you won't have to take another class in one of the domains you mentioned.",

Was quite a bit of fun, although his requirements for the SWS course varied depending on the semester in which you took the course. Unsure of how other profs teach this class, but Lingenfelter was pretty great when I took HST 204 my Sophomore year.",

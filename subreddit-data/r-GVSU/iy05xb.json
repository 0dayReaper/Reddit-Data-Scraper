    "postText": "hey! so my 3 roommates and I are living on campus this year and would like to live off-campus together next year. However, 1 of us has a sponsor that pays for their school meaning they pay for on-campus housing. Does anyone know of any of the apartments around here do some sort of thing that would allow the sponsor to just pay it off in the school bill somehow? This is probably a stupid question, but we're just trying to figure out how to make it work :/",

They might be able to work with Student Accounts and an off-campus complex to add the semester housing costs to your account and then your sponsor could just cover your account and GV could pay the off campus complex. \n\nThis seems like it would be simple if GV and an off campus complex could agree to work together. That said, GV might not be too keen to help send housing dollars off campus.",

    "postText": "My roommates and I want to be able to go home for christmas and see our families. Myself and two of my roommates have done an excellent job of being safe, staying home, and wearing our masks so that we can all go home for the holidays, however after multiple serious conversations we\u2019ve had with our other roomie, they still go out and party and even admitted to us that they were out at a place with at least 20 others tonight. This is ridiculous, and we feel unsafe living with someone that feels there are no consequences to their actions during this pandemic. I\u2019m curious if there is a way to anonymously tip off Grand Valley so that the roommate in question can see there are consequences to their actions.",

If off campus, speak to the rental office and ask what can be done. The 3 of you are doing what you should. No need to worry about the feelings of your 4th roommate as they obviously don\u2019t give a shit about the 3 of you and your families.",

If you live off-campus, contact the leasing office and tell them you won\u2019t be renewing your lease with them if they don\u2019t do something. You have the right to feel safe in your own living quarters. You can contact the health department, too. Good luck!",

She had a roommate who was partying every night and she tried to talk to her but she wasn\u2019t budging. When she spoke to her apartment complex, they said they couldn\u2019t really do anything except offer my girlfriend a different apartment with random roommates which they ended up charging her $200 for. BS imo",

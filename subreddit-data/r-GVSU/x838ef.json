    "postText": "They really are super predatory huh? It's the first day of passes being required, the parking lot isn't even half full, and they went absolutely crazy with the barnacles out here. It's nasty because the main reason they're doing it is to siphon more money away from already poor college students. When I was less financially secure one of those parking boots caused me to have a breakdown because I barely had $80 to pay and I just forgot to put my pass up. Can't imagine the stress that this $162 fine can put on someone's mind when students are already so stressed.\n\n[https://lanthorn.com/86331/news/gv-students-contend-with-new-parking-enforcement-tech-at-off-campus-housing/#](https://lanthorn.com/86331/news/gv-students-contend-with-new-parking-enforcement-tech-at-off-campus-housing/#)",

I don't have a parking pass (even though I am a student) and it's giving me severe anxiety about coming back to my car and having a ticket. I left a note on the windshield but the reputation of security for GVSU really precedes them. Cross your fingers for me please \ud83d\ude2d",

If you complain to absolute there\u2019s a 90% chance the employee won\u2019t give a flying fuck about the situation and there\u2019s no appeal process. Talk to your landlord, your chances get better that way. Hope that helps",

But I do know absolute was Justin\u2019s waiting for them to be able to enforce parking again cause they were trying to break up gatherings of people which they got yelled at for. I assume the reason they go after parking so much is it\u2019s easy for them to do.",

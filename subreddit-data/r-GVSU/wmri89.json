            "comment": "From my experience it really depends. I'm a junior and I've had classes taught completely out of the book and that it was extremely necessary for learning/work, and I've also had classes that are hardly related to the textbook.\n\nIf your class takes part in the GVSU Save program for textbooks, chances are you'll need it and it'll be easier to use that source. But regardless, I always see what I can find a free pdf version of online. If I can't find one, I usually wait a bit, like a week or maybe 2, to try and gauge if the class will be book dependent. Then I buy an ebook if needed. Also, some classes with use a software connected to the textbook like in text quizzes n such. Then you'll have to buy it from their given source.\n\nEdit: clarity.",

There's Mass from 5:30-6:00 Tuesday through Friday and some occasional activity throughout the week (full calendar [here](https://stlukegvsu.org/calendar/st-luke-university-parish-calendar/)) and of course a lot of activity on the weekends, but otherwise it's pretty empty. Especially Monday, that's the day off for the priest and the administrative staff.",

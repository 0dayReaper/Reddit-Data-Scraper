    "postText": "I\u2019m a graduate of GVSU (15, 17) as is my wife (14.) I\u2019m incredibly grateful for my education and have always considered GV as my second home. \n\nHowever, the last few weeks have made me more than disappointed in my school. Not just reading this thread, but the stories being released leading me to believe that the admin has zero idea what they are doing, the insane daily check in students have to do, and how my department is completely unprepared to teach the next generation of my profession this coming school year. \n\nI want to know how I and other alums can assist the current students and faculty at this time. I know little about the alumni association, have they spoke up about this? Can fellow alums start communicating with the university? I work with at least a half dozen other alums who are pissed off as much as I am, we will get the ball rolling! \n\nAny insight is appreciated. Stay strong Lakers!",

I\u2019m sick of the slow drip of information, and personally believe the university needs to go online, as it appears they are woefully unprepared for the virus and keeping their student body safe. The president claims we can be the model college, the school that does it right, but nobody has faith in that. I live off campus, and already my apartment complex and others have quarantine units being filled, because students are still partying, still going out, and not wearing masks. This whole thing is a lose lose situation, but for the sake of everybody that works, lives, and attends Grand Valley, it needs to be put online. I feel alumni joining voices to spread this message to the admin and make the school hear their voices would be very advantageous for this to occur.",

Which, if you give to say the Textbook fund, would benefit students directly. NEVER give to the general fund. \n\nGVSU doesn't really monitor Reddit, but they do monitor Twitter and Facebook. Calling GVSU out in those forums will get some attention to the issue. You can also start email [president@gvsu.edu](mailto:president@gvsu.edu) or [virusactionteam@gvsu.edu](mailto:virusactionteam@gvsu.edu)",

They will likely have an annual newsletter or some other way to disseminate  alumni news-- check out the department website and start by submitting a short update there. Drop a line to your favorite professor(s) and just let them know where you are in your career. Faculty like to hear from former students, but more importantly, we need to know who we can contact if a particular student is interested in job shadowing, or making connections to companies that might need interns, or if we want to invite alumni to give a guest lecture about their field, etc. Having connections to alumni help departments to build stronger programs.",

Look at university of Alabama, a couple of days in they have about 500 cases of corona. It\u2019s just too risky. Why make the investment to partner with spectrum health, hire more safety personnel, set strict guidelines for procedures when you know all it takes is one fool who was at a party last night, or one anti masker to infect an old professor who will then spread the virus further.",

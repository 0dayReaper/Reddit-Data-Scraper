    "postText": "Just got randomly selected. Finally got around to reading the email and at the very bottom under some FAQs, it reads,\n\u201cIs testing mandatory?\n\nTesting is voluntary, but if an insufficient number of tests are performed, the university has less information about the prevalence of COVID-19 on campus to make decisions. If you choose not to participate, no further action is needed.\u201d\n\nSeems like I don\u2019t have to. I won\u2019t because honestly it would be a waste of time in my instance. I have not been to campus all semester, and have no intention to be there. My classes are all online except a hybrid, which I attend online because I don\u2019t have a parking pass. Going to get this test would bring me to campus when I would instead just stay at home. \n\nAnyone else opt out or have any experience with this? Seems kind of silly to hide that it\u2019s not mandatory at the bottom of the email.",

It doesn't appear they are requiring me to do so any more. I'm still going to be tested weekly though -- since it only takes 15 minutes and I'm on campus 4 days/week teaching 10 hours/week F2F, it seems like the right thing to do.",

If you wanna opt out you absolutely can, just respond to the email saying that you\u2019re not going to if you want to respond. They\u2019re helpful and trying to get as many people tested as possible but you don\u2019t need to",

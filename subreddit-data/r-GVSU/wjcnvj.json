That being said, the chances of them calling a snow day is extremely low. \n\nIf the weather forecast is looking bad, I\u2019ve had profs either cancel classes or make class optional",

If you get snowed/plowed into a parking spot and can\u2019t get traction under your wheels to get out, move your car forward and pour cat litter behind your wheels. Then reverse over the litter and you should be able to get out. It creates the traction your tires need! \nYou can also save your friends with this too if you don\u2019t drive.",

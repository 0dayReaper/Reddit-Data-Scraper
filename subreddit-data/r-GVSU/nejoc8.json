    "postText": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m currently a junior and will be a senior this upcoming fall. Just a heads up, I do plan on talking to the internship professor about my issue but I thought I\u2019d hear some other inputs. \n\nHere\u2019s the dilemma, I\u2019m currently interning at a company for my major which is computer science. I have had some lifelong health issues such as living with a brain tumor and having permanent partial blindness. As of recently however I have started to develop some more symptoms from my tumor and so surgery to cut a piece out and undergoing chemo is probably going to happen. My doctor told me that I will probably need both to prevent major growth and extend my life. My doctor also told me that it will more than likely interfere with my internship with recovery and just relaxing from having a brain surgery. \n\nShould I stick with the internship for as long as I can before surgery? Do you think I should bump my credit load for the class from 3 hours to 2 hours which will be 20 hours per week to 16 hours per week? Is it that even possible since we are a week past class registration? I\u2019ve worked so hard to get this internship but to see it be thrown away like that possibly will break my heart. I know health comes first and should always but if I have to take 3-4 weeks off can I still even get credit for the class?",

            "comment": "um i think you should go even lower in credits you having what sounds like brain surgery and i think its important to relax as your doctor said to allow smooth recovery. I also think if you explain the situation you can go to internship as long as possible (like up to surgery) I dont know about the class credit thing either sorry, maybe you can ask registrar? or your prof ?",

If I have to quit and drop the internship I will most definitely be bummed out but my health comes first and I can complete college and out it in hold if need be.",

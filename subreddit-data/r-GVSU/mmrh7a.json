            "comment": "I lived about an hour from Rowan. Busy fast paced area. GVSU is, in my opinion, stuck in the middle of nowhere. Not horribly far from the lake or Grand Rapids but enough of a pain if you will not have a car. My kid graduated from GV and had a great education but I was always annoyed at the lack of stuff near campus. There is not much that is walkable from campus. The bus system has greatly improved but will not be as great at what is around Rowan. \n\nGV and west Michigan will be more caucasian, more conservative. Rowan will be more diverse, urban. I do love Grand Rapids and Lake Michigan though. I can say that West MI is one of my favorite places that I have lived in the world.",

They do have great financial aid for international students tho, and the honors program helps a lot.\nBut if you don't have a car you're pretty much stuck and you'll have to ask people to take you places. And it's very conservative and very white.",

Regardless, I can tell you that GVSU is a wonderful school - I enjoyed attending for both my undergrad and graduate programs. It looks like from your post history that you are Nigerian, which is awesome! I can tell you that GVSU will be a significant culture shock, and is more rural than most people realize. If you're looking for a more urban feel, then Rowan may be more of what you're looking for. Feel free to ask more specific questions about GV and I will do my best to help out.",

The writing program here has some really great faculty (I don't know as much about English).",

            "comment": "Just something to think about since I\u2019ve seen a lot of valid critiques about the location of the Allendale campus; while main campus is a little remote (but by no means isolated or rural), you can get around this by living on the downtown campus! Since I\u2019m a Juvenile Justice minor, I have a few courses on Pew anyway, but I\u2019ve really enjoyed Grand Rapids so far. I\u2019m originally from Chicago and I actually like how much smaller the city is. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, there\u2019s still so much I haven\u2019t explored and the city itself is beautiful. Lots to do, fast paced environment, much more diverse, Winter Hall rates are pretty cheap (financial aid at GV is great), and you\u2019re only 30-45 min away from main campus when you take the Laker Line! Just another angle to look at GV from since living in GR is way more fun, in my opinion, than Allendale. Both have their pros and cons, but the nice thing is that you\u2019ll always have access to GR no matter what with the bus (+ you ride all other Rapid lines free as a student), so don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re trapped in the middle of nowhere!",

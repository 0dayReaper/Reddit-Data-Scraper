Chances are you won\u2019t get caught, but just know student loans are only for educational expenses including room and board. \n\n2. It\u2019s always better to take out as little in loans as possible so they\u2019re easier and more manageable to pay off later. That being said, while you can use loans for rent, groceries, books etc. you really should try to avoid that if at all possible (or use the bare minimum) because paying that off plus interest later can become burdensome.",

You\u2019ll do other tasks like give tours of north campus, make waitlists, or other office stuff they might ask. I really like the job and the staff are great people",

Because of covid we have not been interacting face to face with the community with the exception of tours. So the only people you would be seeing is your coworkers. \n\nI worked a front desk for the fall semester before transferring to CHO. They\u2019re very different. At a front desk you may answer some emails, you\u2019ll loan out keys, help people who are locked out. At CHO you\u2019ll answer emails, phone calls that range from simple questions to angry parents demanding to speak to the director of housing, and it will be at a faster pace (it\u2019s not actually a fast pace job. But compared to a front desk you\u2019ll actually keep busy). If you\u2019re a problem solver you\u2019ll like this job.",

So in charge of keys, Housing Summary Condition forms, Meeting with students who got things like MIPs in the dorms and helping run the Living Center Council. Things like that. Or at least thats what the grads did in that worked in the CHO department while I was an RA. You are also on call like One Week every six weeks I believe. Might help to have a little bit more info though!",

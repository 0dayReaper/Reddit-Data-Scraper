I just purchased my textbooks for the first semester of my senior year, and I just got a notification (twice, mind you) that my textbooks are still out of stock and will be back-ordered until further notice. Just wondering if anyone else is experiencing that problem for the start of this semester.",

Cancel the order and order the books somewhere else (Amazon, Thriftbooks, etc.) (if you can, you definitely can\u2019t get GVSU lab manuals elsewhere)\nOr 2. Let your professor know that the books are on back order, and that you just need to wait. They would hopefully hook you up with scanned pages or whatever you need. \n\nBack orders at the Laker store were typically resolved quickly during my time there, but that was pre-corona.",

I've saved a LOT of money that way, plus you don't have to worry about them not being in stock since they're digital.",

While I think I made the right decision, the honor's college is a solid education and career booster. \n\nPositives:\n\n* Looks great on a resume. It's \"prestigious\". \n* A fantastic intellectual challenge.\n* Better relationships and mentoring with professors, which helps tremendously post-graduation.\n* Replaces many Gen-Eds with more relevant &amp; in-depth courses.\n* Special housing provides a study-focused and quiet atmosphere. \n\nNegatives:\n\n* It's an intellectual challenge. Much more effort &amp; time needed to succeed. \n* Courses are more in-depth.\n* Housing is study-focused and quiet.\n\nTLDR: If you're going to college *solely* for your education, honors is great. If you're going to college for the \"experience\" and \"social life\", honor's *might* not fully fulfill your college dreams. \n\nHope this helps. Cheers!",

            "comment": "I definitely recommend the honors college. I think this is one of the biggest reasons I was able to graduate in 3 years opposed to 4. \n\nPositives: You\u2019d not have to take \u2018normal\u2019 gen eds. I didn\u2019t take history or public speaking or film like my classmates so that was nice in my opinion. Also the foundational class I took was National Security and it wasn\u2019t a topic I had thought about in the past but it was really interesting. Also your classmates are all from different majors and there\u2019s a lot of collaboration brining in different perspectives. It also helps you get through gen ed credits quicker and provides another community at GV. \n\nNegatives: I would say this isn\u2019t a negative of honors but if you\u2019re very outgoing I would recommend to either live in Holton Hooker or any north campus dorm. That way you meet honors students in class but you also have friends not in honors in your dorms it\u2019s the best of both worlds and something I definitely wish I did, Niemeyer just didn\u2019t fit my personality. \n\nThere\u2019s some junior seminar classes int he curriculum but because I was in a health science major and I had specific classes I needed for grad school I was able to get out of it so that could be something that happens to you as well. The senior project is honestly something that will look good on a resume so that\u2019s another plus. \n\nTL;DR honors may be a bit more work, but in my opinion the classes are way more interesting and interactive then other gen ed courses. It provides another community at GV, looks good on a resume, and could let you graduate faster. IF you\u2019re very outgoing still live on north campus to meet other freshman at GV!",

While the dorms are more quiet and less social than a lot of the other halls, I think it hits a good balance. I met some really good friends in the dorm, and was never kept awake by loud neighbors hosting a party or something. The dorms themselves are fantastic as well. I really liked how the classes focus on discussions between everyone in the class, aided by the teacher. In general, honors kind of rocks, especially if you're up for a bit of a harder class. Let me know if you have any other questions about honors.",

            "comment": "Positive: \n\n* Good way to get through gen eds, though it is a LOT of work. There is a lot of reading and you will set yourself up for academic success if you can figure out how to manage it all (or bullshit your way through discussions and essays).\n\n* Looks good on resume.\n\n* Have to maintain a 3.25 GPA or higher. Not too much additional effort to keep a 3.5, which gets you on Dean's List. (Looks good on resume)\n\n\n* You have the option of living in Niemeyer/Vansteeland/Hills, which are quiet and study focused (dry dorms, no parties, takes noise complaints seriously). You can also live in some sectioned off parts of Holton-Hooker, where some of your sequence classes could be. HH is also close to Mackinac and the center of campus so it's easy to get to classes. \n\n* Senior Thesis. This is one of the few saving graces of the program, imo. You have to do research/make a project/art thingy and thats your big \"thesis\". It's not in the normal curriculum; special to honors.  \n\nNegatives:\n\n* Some of the professors clearly expect FAR too much out of honors students simply because they're in the honors college. If you do not have to take a class labeled \"honors section\", then don't. It's not worth the effort for a class that may be way too hard that isn't critically required to be honors. \n\n* It's a lot of work for gen ed classes that some times will have no bearing to your major. While yes, it can improve you as a person, you're not going to see many easy gen eds in the program. Music, Culture, And Aesthetics was a really easy course as someone who's played an instrument before. \n\n* Have to maintain a 3.25 GPA or higher. Not gonna happen if you slack off and party every weekend; you've got readings to do.\n\nIf you're going to be living on campus, live where the social life is. Avoid Niems/Vansteeland/hills if you want to meet people. HH is pretty good in terms of social stuff though. \n\nTL;DR: If you think you can manage the more difficult classes, go for it. I slacked off in them when I got bored and still got above B+ in all the \"honors\" classes. Put in the work, dont slack off (too much), and you can do it. Just don't take more than two SWS courses in the same semester.",

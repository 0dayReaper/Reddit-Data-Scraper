It's either out of paper or out of order with 0 explanation. You'd figure that THE LIBRARY would have printers that work, especially with how much the university charges for tuition. I shouldnt have to go halfway across campus to find a functional printer.",

If you sign into a lab computer and print directly (control-p) you should be able to print without problem.\n\nThe IT desk on the atrium level is also able to assist with printing. They can also issue reimbursements for documents that don\u2019t print (you should request reimbursements immediately though).",

The printer doesn\u2019t know what to do with it and \u201cholds\u201d it.\n\nIt could also be a paper jam. If that\u2019s the case, you can call IT (616-331-2101) and they\u2019ll send someone up to fix it.\n\nIf there\u2019s an out of order sign on the printer, that means it needs service from our contractor. They\u2019re usually pretty quick but have had staffing issues the year. you can go to one of the other printers in the library. Your documents will show up on all the printers.\n\nI know printing is a huge pain in the ass. What I\u2019ve described are what I think are the most common issues/fixes. IT and the library staff are there to help you if you\u2019re having trouble.",

Anyway I'm a non Allendale resident commuter and I'm supposed to pay 480$ for a parking pass... Does anyone have any tips to find free parking for the few days I'm actually on campus ?",

Not ideal, especially because there has been absolutely no information released about distancing/safety on public transit, but I refuse to pay full price for a parking pass to be on campus twice a week until thanksgiving.",

Another strategy is supposedly some spots are easier to get away with illegally parking at than others. I.e. the ones in the student lot and not the teachers lot. Also if and when you get ticketed keep it and just keep it on your car when you park next time to trick parking services into thinking they already got you.",

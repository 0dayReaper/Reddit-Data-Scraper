This is resulting in changes to our fall schedule of courses, which was put in place in January 2020 before the coronavirus was affecting Michigan. Some of these changes will impact existing student schedules. We are simultaneously striving to offer more flexibility and options in course delivery in order to accommodate the various needs of all of our students.\n\nAt this time, it is difficult to predict how each student\u2019s personal schedule will change. One likely change is that many courses may need to move to a \"staggered hybrid\" model where half of the instruction occurs in-person, and half remotely, in order to accommodate social distancing requirements in our classrooms. We are trying to avoid day and time changes as much as possible, but those may also be necessary in order to maximize face-to-face instruction.\n\nYou do not need to take any action at this time. Once the modified schedule is in place (by mid-July), we will notify you and will provide you with instructions to get support for any modifications you need or wish to make.\n\nAs we are all working to respond to external circumstances beyond our control, please know that any changes we make are needed in order to provide a safe learning environment for all involved. We are excited for the fall semester and look forward to having you back on campus. We will work together to navigate COVID-19 and help you continue on your path to a successful future.\u201d",

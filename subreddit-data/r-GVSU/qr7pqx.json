I was an HTM major and i finished my degree but realized how useless it is unless you know people(which i did but i was over the industry post pandemic). I luckily had a finance minor and was fortunate enough to stay another year and do that. Get the business degree, and do an HTM minor. The htm department is GREAT, excellent professors and classes. I love the industry and what it has to offer but it is not sustainable for what most people want in their life and thats just something to take into consideration. Feel free to DM if u want more info/advice",

And I\u2019m not even sure how well a degree would have contributed to my job as barback/porter. Most of it was technical stuff and pretty hands on, but very little customer interaction.",

The industry is all about nights and weekends, special events, and being on call. If that is okay with you, consider were it is you want to manage - restaurants? hotels? vacation spots? You will find yourself constantly interacting with customers and clients.

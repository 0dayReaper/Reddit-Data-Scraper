I would definitely recommend visiting campus if you haven\u2019t already. I think they are requiring freshman to live on campus now but I\u2019m not sure. I think Holton hooker is the newest dorm. Also not sure on that but it is where I stayed my freshman year! It has air conditioning which some of the other freshman dorms don\u2019t. There is also a vaccine requirement so just be aware of that. Other than that just attend your orientation once they tell you when it is and have a good time! Also I wouldn\u2019t recommend buying a parking pass ever. They are very expensive and the busses are great! I have taken the bus nearly every day all four years and parking is free on campus after 6:30pm. I didn\u2019t have a car freshman year and didn\u2019t need it. Two bus routes go all around the off campus apartments and one goes to the Grand Rapids campus as well.",

If you look up GVSU lakerlink then click on the tab that says organizations that will show you a list of all the clubs on campus. Be warned some clubs to have memberships fees associated with them that can range in price. For example, I am in a club that is to my major and the membership fee per semester is $5 plus I must fulfil certain requirements to be consider an active member i.e., recording community service and community events. Community events are basically different talks or events that the org puts on as well as attending meetings. But not all clubs are like this. One of my favorite clubs that I am a current member and on the executive board is called the warrior movement \u201cThe Warrior Movement was founded in 2019 by five college students who saw a need for mental health advocacy in their campus community. We aim to normalize and promote prioritizing one's mental health. To do this, we provide an array of resources, events, activities, and more through biweekly meetings, our website, and social media. We are proud to have created a comfortable and open space for students to explore their mental health and we hope to continue to reach more students each semester. All are welcome and we cannot wait to meet you!\u201d This is from lakerlink. Please free feel to PM me if you have any more questions about the warrior movement or other organizations on campus. Also here is the direct link to where you can find all the different organizations on campus:[https://gvsu.campuslabs.com/engage/organizations](https://gvsu.campuslabs.com/engage/organizations)",

Drinking on campus is a big no no and they take underage drinking very seriously. Definitely find a useful major and find the best way to knock out the necessary classes as quickly as you can. Use your advisor and go to professors office hours",

When I attended they were assigned based off your last name. But once I had my general plan I only met with them to make sure I was going to still graduate on time",

Totally agree with the comment about bringing a fan if you get assigned to a non-air conditioning dorm. You will absolutely regret it if you don\u2019t \ud83d\ude02 I actually brought two with me because I lived on the fourth floor. \nI\u2019ve heard that right now the food at campus dining isn\u2019t great but it\u2019s bearable. Bring a microwave with you if you don\u2019t have a kitchenette in your dorm so you don\u2019t get completely sick of the food.\n\nOne thing I will say is to not be afraid of exploring campus! I\u2019m someone with a bit of anxiety so I tended to stick to areas that I was familiar with, but I ended up missing out on a lot of things freshman year. Go check out the library! Eat at a different place! (Sometimes we have food trucks visit) Use lakerlink to check out events and clubs! Find a new study spot, walk around! There\u2019s a lot to experience as a freshman. \n\nThere\u2019s lots of resources to help you whether it\u2019s advising, financial aid, scholarships, counseling, research for projects, practicing presentations, whatever. Do not be afraid to reach out if you have a question, they\u2019re very helpful 90% of the time. \n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of atm but honestly feel free to DM me if you have any other questions and want a sophomore\u2019s POV!\n\nEdit: Also when you are signing up for classes, use an app called Rate My Professor! It\u2019s a literal life saver",

Don\u2019t forget that you have to be able to live with your roommate but they don\u2019t have to be your best friend :) people grow and change from year to year so don\u2019t be afraid to meets lots of people and let friendships grow/fade naturally (you\u2019ll avoid a lot of drama this way)! Also reach out to people in your labs and classes and form study groups and group chats. There were many a group cram session that saved my exam grades. Last but not least, make sure to have fun! There\u2019s tons of cool spots on campus and downtown to explore, and lots of fun events and parties near gv that make the cold winters and tough semesters worth it!",

I've lived in michigan my whole life and was still shocked by the winter weather somedays. Dont get your hopes up for snowdays either.\nThis is more general but if you have a tablet or iPad, or can afford one, I've found i prefer using it to take notes instead of printing.

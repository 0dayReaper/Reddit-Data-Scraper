            "comment": "I took it back in 2021. Its an insanely hard class and you dive extremely deep into options. If you weren\u2019t good at options in your other classes, or just hated them in general, stay away from this class. Skip class you won\u2019t pass here. \n\nHowever, if you want to learn more about options and are willing to put in the work, it\u2019s very rewarding and you learn a lot. If you plan on taking the series 7 exam you\u2019ll be able to breeze through options, which is the most challenging section that takes up the most study time on the exam. \n\nIf professor Vjay is teaching the class it\u2019ll also just be a much better experience. Although, he might just be the only person that teaches it I don\u2019t remember. Either way he\u2019s easily the most intelligent finance professor at GV. \n\nI got a B in this class btw. I recommend it, you could also say you took the hardest class in the undergrad business school and passed.",

I don\u2019t remember there being a lot of homework, but there were a lot of pop quizzes. It\u2019s mostly a lot of critical thinking and application since options and financial derivatives are pretty abstract. Once you get it and have the formulas memorized you\u2019re fine. It\u2019s just confusing frickin\u2019 stuff.",

I've not had him yet but looking at some ratings, he's a good prof and cares. \n\nI've been waiting for this elective to show up for a year or more. It's not taught very often that I can tell. Maybe one section a year if that. \n\nIf you have any other pointers, feel free to share! \n\nAppreciate the info.",

You have to get it online. I could literally only find one copy used on Amazon. The rest were semester rentals. I think he mentioned that you might not need the book but attendance is very important. In fact, from reading the syllabus, attendance is going to be key. If this class is as difficult as he says it is, indeed missing any class will be rough.",

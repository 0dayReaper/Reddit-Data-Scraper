    "postText": "Hello! The charger for my Surface Book laptop has stopped working completely, and I need to charge my laptop so I can attend class online. Does anyone know if there is a computer lab where I could borrow a compatible charger temporarily or if the Genius phone repair counter in the bookstore would be willing to loan a cable? If not, do they sell Microsoft chargers at Genius? Thank you for any help!",

They\u2019re $72.99 rn down from $89.99. If you decide to get it, make sure you bring your laptop with you, the employees can double check and make sure that the charger is correct!",

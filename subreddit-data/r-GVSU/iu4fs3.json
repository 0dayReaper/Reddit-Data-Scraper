    "postText": "Hello r/GVSU\n\nMy name is Nick Raak and I am running to be re-elected to GVSU Student Senate, and I am asking for your vote. If elected, I promise to:\n\n\\- Advocate for better funding for GVSU. With better funding, students can have better access to university resources (like the infamously terrible parking) while avoiding the cost.\n\n\\- Increase civic engagement for students. Especially with the 2020 elections coming up, it's important to get better participation among students regardless of their political affiliation. I've already been working on this with [a bill unanimously passed this month](https://www.gvsu.edu/cms4/asset/68CD24DD-C5CE-ACD3-A1C4698B1764F93F/s-20-03__urge_grand_valley_state_university_to_amend_the_class_attendance_policy_to_allow_excused_absences_for_voting.pdf) to urge GVSU to implement an excused absence policy to voting. \n\n\\- Keep the university accountable to the students. It's important to advocate for the entire student body by working with GVSU administration to improve transparency and communication.\n\nIf you agree with my platform and want real change for GVSU, vote for me\n\nStudents are given 10 votes, so feel free to vote for whoever else you like. Voting ends Sept. 20.\n\nTo learn more about me, [click this link](https://www.gvsu.edu/studentsenate/meet-the-candidates-123.htm?recordId_1=48A8F8AB-A3BC-2D75-3D3CB50ABE1B7A68#1BB436A3-A938-F98F-B1B8385F6145BAE1).\n\nTo vote, [click this link](https://www.gvsu.edu/studentsenate/vote).",

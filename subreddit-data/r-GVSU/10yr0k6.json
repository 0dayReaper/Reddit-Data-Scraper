He's just putting it out there that he is really into young, sexually na\u00efve, students. Very typical thing from the Republican \"family values\" crowd.   \n\n\nWonder how his wife and 8 kids feel about his volunteering to \"sexually educate\" college students? Probably however he tells them to feel I suppose.",

There\u2019s no exception for what he said, and it\u2019s unacceptable, but bringing political party\u2019s into your comment is a one-sided take. Perhaps he is republican, but democrats have made equally repulsive comments. We should not view this as a political party issue, but rather an issue among this particular individual. \n\nDifferences amongst party belief\u2019s is a great thing we should acknowledge, but not punish and banish.",

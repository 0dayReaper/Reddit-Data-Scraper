    "postText": "\nHi all! I am a senior at GV, and while I have found community during my time here, my greatest regret is not finding support and solidarity with fellow PCOS-havers on campus. For those who are not familiar, polycystic ovary syndrome is an incurable hormonal disorder and is the leading cause of infertility in people with vaginas. Despite its prevalence and profound impact on the lives of those affected, it is still under-researched and underrepresented as a chronic illness. Even though it\u2019s a little late, if there\u2019s even 5 of us out there, we can establish a club that future cysters and allies can build and benefit from! \n\nPlease comment or DM if this sounds like something you are also interested in starting up \ud83d\udc97 I\u2019ve already attended Ignite training and am familiar with the process for creating and maintaining student orgs, so I am ready to go for next semester if you all are! Thanks and happy holidays, Lakers!\u2693\ufe0f\ud83d\udc99",

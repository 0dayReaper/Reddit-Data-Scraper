And between 2 and 4 bedrooms it just really depends on if you\u2019re okay with having extra roommates for a cheaper apartment or would rather pay more to only have one roommate. Personally, I lived in the four bedroom apartments for two years and enjoyed my time living there.",

They're incredibly nice for on campus apartments because theyre still new, quiet, air-conditioned, etc. In South C I never got so much as a fly in my place but in LV I've had problems with spiders, ants, earwigs, etc.",

            "comment": "Apartment style is the best. Your own bathroom, your own kitchenette and lots of space (for a dorm room). Plus you only have one roommate which honestly is easier to deal with as a freshman trying to find your place. I lived in North C and loved it, right across from the C store too so trying to eat in the winter wasn\u2019t a problem for me. However, no AC which was the only downfall",

The 2 bedroom option has a significantly smaller kitchen which was a downside when I was there because I didn\u2019t have a meal plan. Other than that there was plenty of space in the general living space, bathroom and bedrooms",

            "comment": "If you can get the south campus apartments, DO IT. I am in a 2 bedroom apartment on north campus, and while it's better than a lot of other freshman housing, south campus is better in every single way. A/C, living room, bigger kitchen, and I believe cheaper (?). Honestly I think 3 roommates is a pro more than a con, because it's just more of an opportunity to make friends and socialize. Having just one roommate can be kind of a drag, at least for me, as they are not very social so I had a hard time meeting people in the first few weeks. You'll be happy with either, but try to go for the south campus options.",

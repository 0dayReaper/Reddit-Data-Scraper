    "postText": "The testing isn\u2019t actually random; it\u2019s just the students or staff who don\u2019t do the daily self-assessments (or miss a few days) that get \u201crandomly selected\u201d. \n\nEvidence: I got depressed and couldn\u2019t be assed to do the assessments for half this week. And today I got \u201crandomly selected\u201d. Hmm. I never believed it was truly random but now I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s not. \n\nI think it\u2019s more funny than anything. In all seriousness, it was probably a coincidence. But the timing is waaay too perfect for me to not wonder.\n\nEdit: JFC autocorrect, I wanted to say Rona you fucking asshole",

I signed up for one of the morning appointments so I didn't have to wait. They give you a swab and you stick it about a half inch up your nose and swab for about 10 seconds. You do both nostrils on the same swab.\n\nIt's a bit uncomfortable but far better than getting sick or being responsible for someone getting sick.",

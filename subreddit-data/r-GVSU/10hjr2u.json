(minus the music minor, but that's super cool, I've thought about going into music/sound lol).\n\nI'm at Henry Ford College right now getting my fine arts associate and planning on transferring to gvsu for illustration. If you don't mind me asking, was the transfer process easy? Did they take credits for the art classes you did in cc? Also congrats at getting in :)",

The only ones that didn\u2019t go were my higher up art classes, like painting and sculpture. Art history, art appreciation, and my drawing classes all transferred. Honestly you should be fine, make sure you have all your gen eds so you don\u2019t have to take them at GVSU and that you\u2019re following the MTA (Michigan transfer agreement) and you should be just fine!",

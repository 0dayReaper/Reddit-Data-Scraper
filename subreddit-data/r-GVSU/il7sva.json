If she knows what specific restaurant she's assigned to she just walks up to the counter and says she's there to work\n\nIf she doesn't know what restaurant she can just ask any worker to get her in touch with a manager or am. They will put her to work.\n\nKleiner is very laid back to work at but I had a shitty manager when I was there. It was some junior lol. Your daughter will be fine if she just shows up and asks to speak to a manager\n\nOne question I have tho is why are you doing this? I got my first job at 16 on my own dime. I've never once had or expected my parents to do this for me. You're babying her lmao she has to be at least 18",

If she absolutely can't contact someone before hand, then I might gently suggest just showing up and talking to someone. I just wanted another angle to attack in my toolbox so to speak. I may never bring it up with her.\n\nParenting is a lot like teaching. You have to stay at least one chapter ahead. Letting my kids figure things out on their own is optimal. I like to be ready to drop hints if needed.",

Student managers wear the light blue shirt, and they\u2019ll know how to help her. But if it\u2019s busy, try to find one that isn\u2019t helping customers. hope this helps!",

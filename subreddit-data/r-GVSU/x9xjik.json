    "postText": "Long story short, i got a parking ticket from gv parking, i was told by 3 officers i could park my motorcycle where it was and in the morning when i went to move it i got a $100 fine for parking in a fire lane ( it was not ) \n\nI tried to appeal the parking ticket and they denied my appeal. What are my options? Pay and just dont look back? Is there something else i can do?\n\nAnd completely unrelated question, what are the repercussions if i dont pay this ticket.",

For a motorcycle you can park if the unmarked hash marks, if it's marked you can't park and that's probably why you got a ticket. I work for parking and they check each ticket with pictures, if you were in a fire lane/equivalent then that's why you got the ticket.",

We mostly just ticket the staff lots because students keep parking in teacher parking and people who park in stupid spots/handicap. There is enough parking, its just the difference between a 1min walk or a 3min walk. Walk the extra 2 mins and save your money, don't and pay. It's simple lol. We are understaffed so there is always room",

I took pictures, submitted appeals and called the parking office and complained over the phone and they eventually took the tickets off.",

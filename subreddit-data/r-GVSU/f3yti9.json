    "postText": "I drive the 37, witnessed an accident today in front of 48 West. When there is a bus turning right in front of you, wait until we turn so you can see. I'm scared every day of people pulling out while I am turning into 48 West and the drive behind Main St. Pub. Also, don't illegally pass the bus when we are at Mackinac, we aren't there very long and you endanger pedestrians. \n\nThanks,\nCurtis",

The other day, I almost hit someone because they crossed the road without looking after the sun went down. There was no visibility until the last moment when I slammed on my brakes.\n\nSomeone is going to get hurt some day.",

Out at GVSU it should be on every stop. \nAbout the crosswalks though, I find myself stopping the bus even when I don't really need to because who knows if that person is going to walk out into the road or not? \nWhen the crossing guards are out, it's awesome and I hope they are paid more than any other campus job because they deserve it. But when they aren't, I wish there was some other crossing light/guide in place.",

We are supposed to put a left signal on when we merge back in. School busses are the only ones you legally have to stop for and usually only when the stop sign arm is out.",

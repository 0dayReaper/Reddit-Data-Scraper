    "postText": "Hi everyone! I have a non-typical post. I want to share my experience in the graduate school at GVSU so future students can be informed. \n\nI have had trouble with my advisor from the jump, and as I near the end of my second year, tensions are boiling over. After several confrontations with my advisor, it is clear that they are not able to change their ways. Graduate students suffer enough, so I decided to escalate this issue to the program head in hopes of making my remaining time at GV more comfortable. After lots of uncomfortable discussion, the conclusion is as follows:\n\nWhen you are a graduate student at GVSU, there is no safety net for you in instances of unprofessional conduct from your advisor. You have no recourse, and your advisor will not be held accountable for their actions (because they\u2019re tenured, because they bring money to the university, etc.)\n\nIt\u2019s important for prospective students to be aware of this fact BEFORE signing on. Make sure you get along with your advisor. Make sure OTHER STUDENTS in the lab feel safe/happy/comfortable. My options now are to a) walk away from all of my hard work, or b) sit and suffer abuse. I don\u2019t want any other students suffering this reality, whether at GVSU or elsewhere. \n\nIf you have any questions about grad school in general feel free to message me.",

            "comment": "I had an incredibly negative experience at graduate school at GVSU. I loved my undergrad but the English graduate program was awful. I get A's and B's on average for papers and one professor would just arbitrarily tank grades on writing assignments if she didn't agree with your thesis, I know this because several other students and I all worked together and checked each other's work. I don't mean a few point difference either, if she liked what you were saying you'd get an 18 out of 20, otherwise you were lucky to get a 12, and usually got a 4. It was so bad I had a mental breakdown and didn't sleep for 2 weeks. When I talked with the professor about it she recommended I withdraw from the class rather than providing any helpful criticism. That was just one class. The program director was awful and disorganized, would forget appointments she made with you or be up to two hours late for an appointment. It was an awful experience, so I quit and just got a job instead, best choice I ever made. I work for GV now and I absolutely love it and I loved my undergrad but my graduate experience was awful.",

My advisor also wasn't tenured (being tenured or not makes a huge difference).  One of our professors actually founded the program, used to be the director of the whole thing, then willingly stepped down, because he wanted to teach again...this developed into a very strong two-way relationship with administration and faculty, which yielded a lot of great support for me and my classmates.\n\nDo not assume that your experience will reflect all the other grad school programs at GVSU.  \n\nGrad school is difficult and hard...it's going to be stressful, and you are gonna feel like you're drowning quite a bit...that's grad school though; it's supposed to be tougher.",

My sister finished her Masters this year (Canadian Uni) and always spoke about how grueling it was. \n\nWith that out the way, this is.. scant on details. Perspective GVSU grad students don\u2019t gain any insight from this post aside from you having issues with your advisor. The ambiguity of your post can suggest felony-level abuse to unkind emails. With you being a current student, I am sure you want to maintain your anonymity, so I understand the vagueness. Just to be more helpful in warnings others, you need more detail. \n\nI would bet profs, advisers, and fellow students/alumni (? not sure of proper \u201calum\u201d spelling? (def not grad school material)) can offer advice for your situation and I hope they do. Here\u2019s to hoping everything ends well for you \ud83c\udf7a",

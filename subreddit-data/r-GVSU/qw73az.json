    "postText": "Heyo everyone, I'm a reporter for the Lanthorn and I'm working on a story about student experiences with Campus Dining this semester. We already published a story last week about [GV's relationship with troublesome food service company Aramark](https://lanthorn.com/85754/news/students-concerned-with-aramarks-history-and-gvs-campus-dining-options/), but now we're looking to highlight how students are dealing with the many issues affecting Campus Dining over the last few months.\n\nI'd really appreciate if you'd take a look at some questions below to get an idea of the student experiences we want to highlight. If you're a student, feel free to share your thoughts in this thread or send me a DM if that's your jam. Thanks all :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* What are some of the most pressing campus dining-related issues right now?\n* For students living on campus or commuting: how easy/difficult is it to get something to eat from (the few) open dining locations? \n* For students that have allergies/other dietary restrictions or preferences: where can you safely eat on campus? Have your options been cut down due to closures?\n* How are lengthy lines and long wait times at on-campus impacting your daily schedule/routine?\n* Do you feel safe eating in crowded dining areas?\n* How have you had to work around dining location closures?\n* Are the incentives being offered to campus dining employees (free meals after shifts, $100 hiring bonuses, +$2/hr wage increase for working at certain times of day and weekends, bonuses for working through the end of the Fall semester, etc.) enough to attract new employees?\n* Have closures and other dining issues affected your decision to purchase or renew a meal plan?\n* What can the University do to rectify some of these issues?\n\nEdit: updated incentives, and also thanks for everyone's comments. I'm sorry to hear that many campus dining experiences have been rough, but I'm glad that students are speaking up about their issues!",

            "comment": "As a campus dining employee, I feel I should state that the bonus system isn\u2019t even as lucrative as you state. You have to work a minimum of 8 hours a week, not an average, a minimum (so if you get sick and miss a shift you\u2019re out of the running for the bonus). I\u2019m personally only scheduled 6.5 hours each week and I am not allowed to stay longer to get to that point, I\u2019d have to pick up another shift. The scheduling is absolutely awful. This means I likely wont get the bonus even though I have been working through the entire semester. You also get meals based on your average amount of hours a week, not after every four hour shift. Its really dumb.",

Have your options been cut down due to closures?\n\nNa\n\n \u2022 How are lengthy lines and long wait times at on-campus impacting your daily schedule/routine?\n\nAdd upwards of 45 min into my day. Can't make that happen very often. Can just go to bk or culver's anyways \n\n \u2022 Do you feel safe eating in crowded dining areas\n\nYeah\n\n \u2022 How have you had to work around dining location closures?\n\nBring my own food and get annoyed if I forgot to. Most the time I just get food off campus instead due to the lines \n\n \u2022 Are the incentives being offered to campus dining employees (free meals after 4hr shifts, $100 hiring bonuses, +$2/hr wage increase, $500 bonuses for working through the end of the Fall semester, etc.) enough to attract new employees\n\nNo that's still God awful and a waste of time for anyone. Better opportunities on campus and way better ones found on handshake for off campus. Going to a job fair will give someone far more opportunities with higher pay and bonuses regardless. We're in a wage strike and gv needs to play ball if they want employees.\n\n \u2022 Have closures and other dining issues affected your decision to purchase or renew a meal plan?\n\nYes it's specifically why I didn't get one.\n\n \u2022 What can the University do to rectify some of the issues \n\nHigher pay. It's supply and demand at work. Really that simple.",

            "comment": "I worked for campus dining before the pandemic and I wouldn't go back even with the incentives they're offering. The library is offering equal pay to what CD has listed on Handshake and I get to do my homework there and not work in a hectic environment with a lot of COVID policies. Obviously the CD workers (especially the student workers) are doing all they can and I'm grateful for their hard work so I can get lunch and dinner in between my busy schedule times. I'm a teacher assistant through the College of Ed, taking classes, and working downtown at Steelcase Lib. The cafe in DeVos doesn't have very many options, but it's got a shorter line that Erbert &amp; Gerbert's and the students who work there are always super friendly. I think the lack of appropriate pay is really what's driving down most campus jobs. It's not livable in the slightest, especially with limited hours while going to school. And when they only cap you at 24 hours each week (at least for the lib), you don't even have the opportunity to offset the low pay with more hours.",

I'm a supervisor at one of the academic offices and it's no contest whatsoever, students would much rather work at a place that has a nice pace where they can do homework during slow times rather than a hectic stressful environment. Unfortunately because of the University policy of equity (which has its advantages) it is highly unlikely that we'll see the starting wage for CD workers rise higher than that of other student workers. It is a shame because I remember one of the best experiences as a student was the food, going to late night and having chicken wings or a quesadilla and hanging out with friends. Shame.",

            "comment": "Preface: This comment should NOT disregard my appreciation toward all campus dining employees as I think I can speak for an overwhelming majority of students when I say how thankful I am for their dedication and commitment to the student body.\r  \n\r  \n**1:** Weekends are a big issue. (Availability/options/hours). Fresh and subway are the only options for weekends and fresh isn't even an option on Saturday because of the poor food quality (leftovers, lack of options). Its clear that the CD workers are doing everything they can, but there need to be some changes.\r  \n\r  \n**2:** On campus (laker village). Other than the lengthy walk, which was our choice admittedly, accessibility is not a huge concern.\r  \n\r  \n**3:** Not applicable for myself and roommates however my SO had extremely limited options last year with her allergy and half the time would experience mild-to-moderate reactions due to cross contamination.\r  \n\r  \n**4:** The lines tend to be long but after getting into a routine and knowing the busier times, it became easier.\r  \n\r  \n**5:** Yes, I feel safe. Considering most if not all public places in Michigan (aside from universities) require no social distancing/mask mandates it is not a concern.\r  \n\r  \n**6:** Have not really had an option in terms of working around dining closures. Despite paying for a full meal plan that promises a wide array of options, many of these options were stripped away about a month into the semester. While this isn't a huge issue for myself as I don't mind eating the same thing every day, I can see it as being a problem for most. \r  \n\r  \n**7:** From what I hear, no. Looking at Handshake, it still displays $9.87 hourly wage, which is just not competitive in the slightest. Off campus jobs (within bus distance) offer far superior wages and seemingly better conditions. I feel really bad for campus dining employees sometimes.\r  \n\r  \n**8:** The closures have not and will not affect my decision to buy a meal plan. As many complaints as I (and my peers) have, the convenience is where campus dining remains unmatched. \r  \n\r  \n**9:** I think the most important thing we should look for is more competitive wages. (Granted, I don't know exactly what starting wage is and I am going solely off of what is posted on Handshake)",

            "comment": "I think another aspect to look at is the way the employees are treated. I went to panda one day and saw two employees on break. Then after abt 10min, an older adult employee, came over to them and started berating them about how breaks work. She the older employee was so rude abt it and did this in the dining room where everyone could see. Which would make me embarrased I cant imagine how they felt.",

            "comment": "* What are some of the most pressing campus dining-related issues right now?\n\nPay for workers. Why would you make 9.87 an hour (unless you work nights or weekends) when you could take the bus down the street to get better hours and training and get paid 5 bucks more an hour? \n\n* For students living on campus or commuting: how easy/difficult is it to get something to eat from (the few) open dining locations? \n\nI live on south campus, so walking isn\u2019t really an issue for me. I mainly eat at panda and occasionally at Fresh, but fresh tends to make my digestive issues flair up. \n\n* For students that have allergies/other dietary restrictions or preferences: where can you safely eat on campus? Have your options been cut down due to closures?\n\nI personally don\u2019t have any serious dietary restrictions, but for those who do\u2014 there\u2019s none. Cross contamination happens at every location, as well as already very limited allergy friendly options. Your best bet is the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches at fresh or just spending your dining dollars at the pod stores to buy food you know you can eat. \n\n* How are lengthy lines and long wait times at on-campus impacting your daily schedule/routine?\n\nDoesnt affect me too much, but then again I only eat after at campus dining after my classes are over. Lines have gotten better but I think that\u2019s less to do with the student workers and more with students getting sick of the food.\n\n* Do you feel safe eating in crowded dining areas?\n\nMost of campus is vaccinated, and this is how most of the state is functioning right now, so it\u2019s fine.\n\n* How have you had to work around dining location closures?\n\nYes!! I never go out to eat on weekends, the only thing to eat is leftover shit from fresh.\n\n* Are the incentives being offered to campus dining employees (free meals after shifts, $100 hiring bonuses, +$2/hr wage increase for working at certain times of day and weekends, bonuses for working through the end of the Fall semester, etc.) enough to attract new employees?\n\nNot enough to attract enough new employees\u2014 it only works for them if they work a certain amount of hours each week, so if they call out because they\u2019re sick they lose those bonuses. Plus, everyone knows the major issues with campus dining\u2014 you\u2019d have to offer a lot more PERMANENT incentives (such as better working conditions) for people to come.\n\n* Have closures and other dining issues affected your decision to purchase or renew a meal plan?\n\nI purchased a smaller meal plan this year, but that was mainly because I would have a kitchen to cook in in my new dorm. If campus dining does continue to go downhill, however, I\u2019ll likely buy an even smaller one next year.\n\n* What can the University do to rectify some of these issues?\n\nCut out aramark!!!!!",

            "comment": "unisex bathroom stalls for emergencies. in manitou or kindschi, the bathrooms are usually pretty empty. you can probably find a nook in there while classes are in session. i\u2019ve cried in both i believe. \n\nif you\u2019re at north campus: there\u2019s a door that leads out of kistler that no one ever uses, by the mailboxes. go through it and it\u2019s a very private spot. \n\nsouth campus: just go behind the apartment-style buildings where there\u2019s no doors nearby and you should be okay. \n\nif you\u2019re at kirkhof: the lower level is usually empty, especially by the radio room. I literally never seen anyone there. there\u2019s also stairs that lead outside. they\u2019re also very private. \n\nhonorable mentions: behind lake huron hall seems good, and there\u2019s a dumpster by kleiner that\u2019s probably good too, if you\u2019re behind the opening where people walk in. \n\nhope this helped!",

The connection upstairs used to be secluded as well, especially the bathrooms. \n\nDowntown Campus has a few bathrooms that I swear no one uses, by the small staff only parking lot. There\u2019s a study room on the 2nd or third floor tucked in the far corner of campus (overlooking winter ave and Fulton intersection) that few people use.",

There is a gravel path that leads back there, some benches, a beautiful view, and a nice wall to dart behind if you need a little extra privacy.\n\nIndoors: the theater at Kirkhof is pretty private most times of the day, and has comfortable seating. There's a restroom for freshening up afterward, too.",

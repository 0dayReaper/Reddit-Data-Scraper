There are a ton of sales going on in stores right now, and I\u2019m interested in buying some clothes for college this year. I\u2019m an 18/F, but I have no clue what I should buy. Any advice would be appreciated!",

I would say a couple stable going out pieces (if you are into that), a good pair of jeans, several tops, a good jacket, but really comfy clothes are going to be your go-to around campus. Leggings, sweatshirts, etc. are typically what people wear to class/ to study. Also a good idea to have some professional clothes so that if you have internships/ job shadows you have something to wear. Best of luck!",

Cannot beat 12 dollar joggers. \n\n- Tommy hilfigur at Tanger (dirt cheap prices for high quality designer stuff, only cheap at Tanger)\n\n- marshals for discounted clothing. One is by Riverton\n\nBuy a nice coat. Uniqlo always has great cheap ones. Can't go wrong with tnf as well or even Carhart\n\nBuy nice boots. Walking in the snow on campus is wild\n\nIf you want to be stylish and cozy just do whatever Billie eilish is doing. Big hoodies and sweaters, relaxed/wide/straight fit denim, chunky Filas/air force 1s/etc in all white \n\nGet a pair of cheap running shoes or new balances. Your feet will thank me. I got a pair of nbs at marshals for $20. I probably wouldn't advise af1s as they aren't comfy but they aren't as bad as converse and are cheap and super in",

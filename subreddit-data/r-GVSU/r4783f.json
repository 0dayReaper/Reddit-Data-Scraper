    "postText": "So, long story short, I had a buddy of mine planning on moving in with me to either Murray or vansteeland or one of those. He will not be able to move in this semester like we hoped. I still really want to move out and I'm frantically looking for options. One I came across was the 1 person efficiency at Laker Village. Normally I wouldn't want this for a long time but It's only gonna be one semester as I have plans already for next year housing wise. I think it would be a nice decent little way to still get away from my parents house for at least another semester. Wanted some opinions on this place if anyone has experience.",

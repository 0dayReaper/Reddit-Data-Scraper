    "postText": "Hey r/GVSU \\- my name is Alex and I work for Mantra Health. We're a digital health and wellness company that aims to give college students the tools to live happier, more fulfilled emotional lives.\n\nWe've been working on a wellness coaching program that includes personalized 1:1 interactions with a professional coach and access to a robust self care content library. I believe this program can help students needing wellness support on topics such as anxiety, confidence, and communication, which I know is something that I could have benefited from when I was a student.\n\nIf this is something that you may be interested in, you can complete\u00a0[**our screener here**](https://form.jotform.com/230093910272045)\u00a0to see if you are eligible.\n\nThe program is\u00a0**free**\u00a0to all participants and we are looking to begin our pilot in the next few days.",

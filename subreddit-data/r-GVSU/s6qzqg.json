    "postText": "I'm going to be doing a lot of printing for one of my classes this semester and I can't have my pages be double-sided. The printing website that we submit documents to be printed to always automatically sets my documents to print double-sided. \n\nIs there a way that I can change this somehow or do I need to go and add a blank page between every single page of my assignments this semester? I've tried looking on Pharos'(parent company of the service GV uses) website for answers to no avail, and nothing on the website we submit our documents to before printing has anything to edit this either from what I've found.  \n\n\nThank you for any help in advance :)\n\n(Also sorry if this is a dumb question, I'm just not super familiar with the printers that GV uses.)",

            "comment": "I wouldn't recommend putting in a blank page because I think you'll still get charged, and if you've got a lot of printing this semester, it will add up. I don't think GVprint has the option to print one-sided, or at least I've never been able to find it. \n\nThe best advice I have is just logging onto one of the GV computers and sending the job through there after changing the settings. Most of the on-campus printers have computers close by, so hopefully it won't be too inconvenient for you.",

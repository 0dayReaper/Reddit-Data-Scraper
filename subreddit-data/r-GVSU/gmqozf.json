I also served on hiring committees at each one of those levels.\n\nThe Snoop quote is so true. GV is a unique place in that they will evaluate more than what you are on paper. You were selected for an interview, so they like your stats, so be yourself, think of examples that highlight your achievements or hard work, and don\u2019t stress as long as you TRY your best. Tell them why you want to be there through your answers and you\u2019ll be fine. Good luck, OP.",

I came prepared with my own questions which definitely helped, and I also focused on asking questions that made it clear that I am interested in using the position to help develop my skills that will help me in the future. GAs are great opportunities for professional development, so make it clear that you have some experience, but you're looking to grow and improve. Other than that, relax, be professional, and be yourself. If you see an opportunity to make a joke, take it. You got this!",

    "postText": "Hi all! I am an incoming freshman this year and I was looking into getting an on-campus job. I saw that the writing center was hiring for tutors during second semester, and I was curious if there was anyone on here who had some insight into the job and whether it's worth it or not. Definitely let me know, I'm curious about what you guys have to say!",

            "comment": "I agree with the other comment, you need to have a professor referral and need a B+ or higher in the class you wish to tutor. I\u2019m just letting you know right now, if I were to have a tutor for one of my classes and I found out he/she was a freshman I would immediately stop attending or just not show up. Usually tutors are reserved for the top students who excelled in the coursework. With you coming in as a freshman, I would wait a year or even 1 semester before you jump into tutoring, shoot classes are nothing like high school so I doubt you\u2019ll even have time to be a tutor (that\u2019s what happened with me ironically).",

            "comment": "You typically need a prof\u2019s referral/approval for this position. I can\u2019t remember the exact process but you go to the tutoring center for the application and part of it you need a signature from one of the profs in the department (of the subject you want to tutor) to endorse you for the job. Then you take it back to the tutoring center and they get it through and you put in the schedule you want to work.\n\nWhen students sign up for tutoring sessions they will either request a certain tutor by name, or the tutoring center will match them with tutors with the same availability. Depend on the subject they may or may not match you several students in the same time slot, you only get paid for the hours not head count though.",

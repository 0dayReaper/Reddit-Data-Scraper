Let those who are still paranoid to continue wearing if they\u2019d like. We\u2019re all vaccinated. It\u2019s been really shitty not getting to see any faces my entire tenure at GVSU. I am graduating in 2 short months.. my college experience has basically been shit on by the virus so it would just be nice to have some sense of normalcy back in school.",

Lifting the restrictions prematurely may send cases right back up and put us right back to where we were in the beginning. I'd love to be able to not wear a mask but we need to be careful.",

The CDC says that people in Ottawa County are no longer recommended to wear masks (although they can choose to do so out of an abundance of caution) , and that people in Kent County can consult a doctor to see if they should wear a mask if they have health issues.\n\nBy the way, this is not a premature time to lift mask mandates. The correct time to lift mask mandates is when cases are plummeting naturally, and the correct time to wear masks is when cases are rapidly rising. If we wait until covid levels are at an all time low, cases will be on an upslope already by the time we lift the mandate. We're not going to be on a downslope forever.",

I think considering 75+% of the countries population, on top of the other 20-24% that have already probably had Covid, there\u2019s a sure fire bet that majority of us are able to escape an infection and or serious health related issues. Covid isn\u2019t what it was last year. Omicron has pushed this pandemic into an endemic phase which is why I believe the cdc released there guidelines today. At some point, we need to stop being so scared and just live our lives again. The people that are still worried, can continue wearing masks, but allow us individuals who don\u2019t want to anymore, not wear them. I don\u2019t have faith in gvsu to allow us to have our freedoms back though.",

And ya know, you might get it and be perfectly fine. But what if you get it and give it to Steve who gives it to his immuno compromised grandma at home? What if it gets out of hand again and GV forces us back online? I am sick of the pandemic as much as anyone else, but we shouldn't be too hasty when removing mandates. The CDC all but admitted the laxed guidlines were to force people back to work, so I would take what they say with a grain of salt. As the person you replied to mentioned above, we need to be careful about this",

Our unemployment levels are at their lowest they have ever been according to most recent data, so I don\u2019t think that an accurate response. Considering how many people were getting sick, and how few were dying to it, I would definitely say we are practically in endemic phase. The way I see it is this, if someone has an immunocompromised family member or someone they are around often who is, then they should have the common courtesy to wear a mask in public areas. If the vaccine does what it is suppose to do, and seems to do, and masks work as they say, in theory, said person wouldn\u2019t get sick..I\u2019m just totally sick of the masks and half of my college experience being destroyed to this pandemic. While I watch other colleges around the country without mandates doing just as good as we are with mandates..",

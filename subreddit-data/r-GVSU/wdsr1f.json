It helped me graduate with my bachelors a year early (3 years opposed to 4) and looked great on my resume for grad school. The honors sequence classes will definitely be more interesting than your other gen ed courses. Only thing I regret about my honors experience was living in Niemeyer (I\u2019m very outgoing), had Holton Hooker been around when I started at GV I would have live in the honors at HH",

I really enjoyed the classes, and the Honors Senior Project is truly a free for all. I wrote and edited 5 new chapters of my novel, edited 6 previously written, and walked out of GVSU with the first 1/3 of my first novel done. It was a wonderful experience, and I\u2019d never do it any other way.",

            "comment": "I was also in the honors college. I lived in Holton hooker and it was super nice having a new dorm. The three person rooms are huge with tons of windows, and I made tons of friends in my hall. I don\u2019t feel like I got anything special out of the honors program, but really you just have to do your first year sequence which is typically fairly interesting and counts for a good amount of Gen Ed\u2019s, a junior seminar which is just one class that isn\u2019t bad, and a senior project which can kinda be whatever you want it to be and can be as many credits as you want. I just did two credits and wrote a paper and it wasn\u2019t too bad. And it\u2019s nice to put on applications. I didn\u2019t find it to be like life changing or anything, but I thought it was worth it. I usually had good profs for my honors classes too. I\u2019m not sure if they have changed the program at all but this is just from my experience with it",

            "comment": "I was in GV's Honors College from 2014 - 2017. Overall I enjoyed it, the rooms on Niemeyer were really nice, however, it wasn't as social as I was expecting (everyone kept their doors shut), but that didn't necessarily bother me. The classes / honors project were interesting and I felt the professors in Honors classes were really strong. \n\n In my experience after college, I couldn't say being a part of Honors really helped me in my job search. It was something I mentioned in interviews and it was on my resume, but I don't think it gave me \"the edge\" against anyone else(at least in my experience). I think my internship and clubs did that more than Honors. Now, 5 years out of college, I don't even mention I was in Honors during interviews. \n\n I did enjoy my experience with Honors, however, and if you are considering it, certainly look into it! I think it is worthwhile.",

            "comment": "I did the honors college and I really regret it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you meet some great people and have some world opening experiences. For that I am thankful. But because I came to GVSU with like 35 AP credits I was pretty much done with any gen Ed\u2019s, so the honors college probably added a year of unnecessary course work to my load. So basically don\u2019t do it if it won\u2019t help you get ahead. If you only have a couple credits or none at all though it\u2019s a fantastic opportunity that you should take advantage of. \n\nRemember in your time there to keep an open mind always and never let your passion for learning and empathy wane.\n\nEdit: also Idk if Professor Wampler is teaching a course next year but by all means aim for him. He\u2019s an amazing teacher and role model.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m in the honors college now. You get away with traditional general education courses. You need to take 27 credits for honors while other regular GV students have to take 35-41. Housing is way cheaper than other places with similar layout. Honors college is also the only place that comes with a dishwasher so if you cook it\u2019s an additional plus.\n\nIn terms of rigor it\u2019s not bad at all. I did have friends who took difficult first year sequences so it\u2019s good to ask around. The courses are very unique and it\u2019s refreshing to take from other traditional classes. I can only say for my sequence but many activities were hands on and open-ended rather than multiple choice. The sequence also takes up 12 credits freshman year so you\u2019ll get close and become friends with a lot of cool people. \n\nLast thing to add, the honors community is definitely on the quieter side. It\u2019s rarely loud and I have never experienced/heard of noise problems or weird stuff going on.",

People in hills seemed to have more fun. I loved the classes tho. Freshman sequence was a way more fun/interesting way to get gen Ed\u2019s and I made some good friends. They were also pretty nice about being flexible with requirements, I asked if my study abroad courses could be my \u201cjunior seminar\u201d (it was not my junior year?) and they said yes with no pushback. A friend wasn\u2019t interested in the honors art options so she asked if she could take a non-honors creative writing class and they were fine with that. Senior project I just did one credit and did a volunteer project and research project. Picked an advisor I knew would give me an A and all was well.",

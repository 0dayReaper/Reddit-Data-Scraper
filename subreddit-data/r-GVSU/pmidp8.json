    "postText": "I\u2019m just venting here, but this is also a partial PSA:\n\nIf you leave the student section/seating area to get water, use the bathroom, grab something from concessions, you are NOT allowed back to your seat. \n\nI knew going into the game that if we left Lubbers stadium we couldn\u2019t get back in, cool. We knew ahead of time. That\u2019s fine. \n\nBut there were security staff blocking students who exited the student seating section to use bathrooms/visit concessions from re-entering the seating. Those students never left the stadium. They left the seating section. \n\nI\u2019m more angry that they didn\u2019t give students a heads up. And having spoken to the security staff at the exit of Lubbers stadium, the security staff wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing this INSIDE of the stadium. Figured I\u2019d let everyone know what\u2019s going on\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

This year they decided to use the outside vendor mentioned for whatever reason. \n\nHopefully the situation improves by the next game, but you\u2019d expect everyone to be on the same page even if it\u2019s the first game.",

Partially because we couldn\u2019t even go to the bathroom without being barred from our seats, but also the ushering staff was SOOOO disrespectful and aggressive with the students. It was awful:(",

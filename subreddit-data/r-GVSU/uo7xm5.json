            "comment": "1. Prices range pretty wildly (campus view or trio being the cheapest and the lodge being most expensive) look on their websites/ get quotes for monthly rent prices and if utilities are included. \n\n2. Normally august and last between 9-12 months. Sometimes you can ask to move in in July or earlier but not sure what places still do that\n\n3. 3 not including yourself is pretty standard\n\n4. Ive lived at campus view, but know enough from people who\u2019ve lived at trio and 48 west to get the gist\n\n5. Can\u2019t remember sorry my guy",

            "comment": "This is based on Canvas Townhomes (formerly known as Copper Beach) \n\n1. 500-600+ per month for a four bedroom unit. However Canvas has a variety of leases available so the cost may differ depending on what you\u2019re looking for. There is a flat utility rate, a flat furniture rate, and you can get insurance included. Units range from 1 bedroom to 4 bedrooms. Not sure what the lower units cost so I recommend checking the website or scheduling an appointment with a canvas employee. You can either get an old unit or an updated one. There are very few differences between the two other than cosmetics (furniture, cabinets, kitchen appliances). I believe canvas is moving to update all units at some point. \n\n2. Leases generally go from August to August or August to May. You are allowed to move out early but it will cost you a fee. You can move in early but your options may be limited depending on what type of units are available. The earlier you sign a lease, the more benefits with rent you can get. \n\n3. I have three other roommates, though this largely depends on what type of unit you have. You can have 0-3 other roommates not including yourself. You each get a personal bathroom and bedroom. You share a common area and kitchen, along with some closets and utilities. Roommates need to all agree to pay a shared furniture and utilities fee. Two units share a patio and a porch. \n\n4. Unfortunately I cannot remember, though I believe it varies depending on the time of year. \n\nThough I can\u2019t speak for all residents, I can definitely say that I have a pretty decent time living at canvas. Only downside for me is that unless it\u2019s high priority, maintenance can be backed up most of the time.",

I paid somewhere between $400-500 per month for my bedroom (and private bathroom) in a 4 bed, 4.5 bath townhouse at 48 west, but that was a few years ago before inflation spiked.  Each roommate had their own bedroom. I don\u2019t remember about having a down payment tbh.",

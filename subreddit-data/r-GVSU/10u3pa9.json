I could be wrong, but that is what it stated in my \"congrats\" email. Just thought you should know, because I thought the same thing until I got it!",

            "comment": "The Pledge is essentially last priority funding marketed as free tuition. It\u2019s basically modeled for Pell Grant recipients. \ni.e. families who made 50k receive a Pell Grant \n\nIt\u2019s important to know, the Pledge does not cover anything other than tuition and you have to qualify for it every year when your complete your FAFSA. \n\nMore importantly, the Pledge is only there to supplement your tuition cost. If you get a big enough Pell Grant that will cover your tuition, you will see no effect from the Pledge. But let\u2019s say your tuition is $7000, and you receive a $2500 Pell Grant, the Pledge will give you the $5000 to pay for the rest. \n\nGenerally students who file independent don\u2019t make as much money; so if you happen to be that person, the pledge really won\u2019t be different from your Pell Grant.",

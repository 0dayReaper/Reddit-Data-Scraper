    "postText": "So I'm currently in my second year at GV. I've been planning quite a bit because I was considering a transfer. Anyways, it looks like I'll have 113 credits at the end of next year if everything goes how I'm hoping (with spring/summer 2021 classes). I'll have all of my major, minor, and gen ed requirements, but I will not have the 120 credits needed to graduate. Is there any way to appeal this? I don't really want to go another semester just to take 7 random credits. I know it's still a while ahead in the future, by my transfer decision kind of hinges on the possibility to graduate early.",

            "comment": "Unfortunately you need 120 credits to graduate and I\u2019ve never heard of anyone appealing this. The only options I could think of is to take a lighter course load fall 2021, more credits winter 2021 and spring/summer 2021 to make up those 7, or take a full schedule fall 2021 and don\u2019t take spring/summer courses",

            "comment": "You can earn up to 32 credits by exam. For many students, this means coming in with AP or IB credits, however you can also take CLEP exams to earn credit while you are a college student. For example, if a math major who came in taking calc as a freshman is just a couple credits shy, they could go back and take the CLEP exam for college algebra and pick up a few credits that way. The key is to find an exam that you can pass without a lot of extra studying, although if you wanted to study independently for the exams, then that might open up more possibilities for earning credit.",

Spanish 101, Marketing 350, and History 110 (i think) were all passable with minimal studying and the tests cost like $80 each (had 2 years of high school spanish and got that with no prep)\n\nThey did have a rule that your last XX number of hours had to be \"traditional\" credits, so you may need to make sure you take any CLEPs before starting your senior year.",

Pissed me off at the time (I was preparing for grad school) but my advisor basically said he\u2019d sign off on any pre-reqs that I would need.  Ended up taking some amazing upper level classes in poli-sci, art history, and anthropology that I never would have done otherwise.  Also - you can take these type of classes credit/no credit if you don\u2019t want to have to worry about your GPA.",

You could potentially take credits at a local community college and appeal the last 30 credit hours in \"residency\" at GVSU (this is a fairly common request and easily approved). \n\nIf you think you'll do those 7 credits at GVSU, look into microcredentials like a badge or certificate, then at least the credits aren't random and you get something to put on your resume. Here are some badges that are around 7 credits: [https://www.gvsu.edu/acad-index.htm?page=1&amp;search=&amp;type=8EFB935E-90D9-4283-9621A6F7F918BB5E&amp;interestId=&amp;location=&amp;format=](https://www.gvsu.edu/acad-index.htm?page=1&amp;search=&amp;type=8EFB935E-90D9-4283-9621A6F7F918BB5E&amp;interestId=&amp;location=&amp;format=)\n\nCertificates will usually be more credit hours: \n\n[https://www.gvsu.edu/acad-index.htm?page=1&amp;search=&amp;type=CCE13793-B23D-0005-C0F75DB99B170972&amp;interestId=&amp;location=&amp;format=](https://www.gvsu.edu/acad-index.htm?page=1&amp;search=&amp;type=CCE13793-B23D-0005-C0F75DB99B170972&amp;interestId=&amp;location=&amp;format=)",

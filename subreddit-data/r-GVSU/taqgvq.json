GV states that the average is 60k but many people I have interviewed with said that\u2019s a bit high. I have been offered a solid position for 54.5k along with 4 weeks pto which I feel is reasonable but would like to hear from others!",

A lot of the work that's for undergrads just doesn't pay well because it's almost always leading into doing grad school. (My field is like this too but you get paid a ton more with just a bs and a lisense) The two fields of study are somewhat unique because of that but it screws over so many students attempting to reach livable wages even when studying \n\nLot of people just end up doing stuff like management or whatnot because it pays above 15/hr. I think parapros are only at like 14/hr for this state which is terrible too",

I'd accept as the experience with a large company will be great, and the compensation is good as well. Just take into account the cost-of-living. \n\nAfter 1.5 - 2 years you can always jump ship for a salary increase.",

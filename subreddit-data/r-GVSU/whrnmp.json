    "postText": "Hello, I'm a junior here and a long time rock collector, and I wanted to see if I could put my massive collection to good use. \nMy idea is basically to set up a table at Kirkhof to sell fossils for charity. There is already another small business that has all rock related things that sells there too so I don't know if this would be too similar. \n\nBefore going through the whole process to put it into motion I wanted to first see if there'd be any actual interest in this. One of the big detractors here is that I really don't have enough Petoskey stones to sell, they're very rare around here and the ones I do have aren't big enough for anyone to really want.\n\nHowever I do have a million other very interesting fossils and plenty of different types, and I'll be selling them for pretty cheap. I also plan to make a handful of necklaces.\n\nIf anyone's interested or has anything to say at all about this please let me know, thank you.",

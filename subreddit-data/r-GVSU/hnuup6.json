    "postText": "I just don\u2019t think I can be convinced by their \u201ctown hall\u201d meetings - which seem more like corporate PR pandering. I really, *really* hope that I am proven wrong and that everything opens up no problem - but look around.\n\nThe nation is in its largest spike currently with the GR area leading the way for Michigan, and grand valleys solution thus far to an outbreak is to shut down a few areas of a dorm? By the time anyone notices or cares, half the school will be infected. I personally see GV open until October until it\u2019s moved all online. Again, I really hope I\u2019m wrong!\n\nI guess my point is I want more concrete planning in place and details by the administration than a few scripted town hall meetings. What\u2019s going to happen when several students are sick? Will they close campus? Think about the smaller things: campus dining, book store, everyone on bus lines who need to commute in winter, just walking through kirkhof, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s ok for the administration to say \u201cwe don\u2019t know.\u201d But at this rate, what\u2019s the likelihood they actually open campus and stay open all year? Should they be planning more on everything at least being hybrid? Enough with the scripted talks.\n\nThat\u2019s just my two cents.",

Also anyone living in in campus housing at my university have been left somewhat in the dark after being told \u201cwe will not uphold your room assignments we will try to keep roommates together but it\u2019s not promised\u201d. It\u2019s not just GV that\u2019s leaving students in the dark it\u2019s many schools likely because they don\u2019t know what the best decisions are and the pandemic keeps changing",

Going to a mix of online and in-person is an attempt to be flexible and provide what people are asking for.\n\nThere are absolutely people saying they will not attend unless classes are face-to-face and others saying they will not attend unless they can be completely online. There is no way GVSU can please everyone. \n\nIt may be hard to believe, but GVSU works hard to be there for students. For example, it may surprise you to learn that GVSU has a program where students with unexpected hardships can have tuition forgiven, and in the meetings where those decisions are made, the policy is to look for reasons _to_ forgive tuition. I doubt that is a common policy for universities.\n\nI recognize that it sucks not to get what you are expecting and what you signed up for. Faculty, staff, and administration are not getting what they signed up for, either. Right now, there are across the board as well as targeted budget cuts, a hiring freeze, no cost of living increases for employees, and increased mandatory teaching loads for faculty. So, as a faculty member, I am doing more for the same money. I understand the frustration.\n\nAnd yes, GVSU is making some decisions based on financial realities, like only getting 3% of their budget from state support (and it's less every year). But to say that GVSU is doing things in a way that is intentionally ambiguous is inaccurate and, imo, unfair",

There have been rudimentary plans in place including fewer seating options that are made farther apart, one person per room arrangements in the dorms, and closure of select dining areas - but what happens when there is an outbreak in the dorms? Do all of those students need to go on lockdown? How will they get food, or go to class? What happens when a student or member of faculty dies? How will off campus parties be policed? \n\nThere are a multitude of things that have either not been addressed properly or have not been addressed at all, and that I think is intentional.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'll be transferring to GVSU for the fall of 2020 semester (first time at a university). Just out of curiosity for those that have been a student at GVSU, is there a dance team at that school? Or just a dance class where you can just dance for fun? (as well as for a grade). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have taken dance or have been on the dance team, what is your experience like?",

            "comment": "Both. GV has a dance team that puts on little shows during breaks at sporting events (possibly other events as well). Not sure if they travel for competition. \n\nGV also has an annual think called \"Dance Troupe\" I believe. Essentially any and all females at GV can sign up. You get split into \"troupes\" and choreograph a dance routine (usually to a popular song. Most choreograph to hip-hop (Step-Up style). They all compete on an actual stage and a winner is selected. \n\nGV also has a handful of dance courses. My wife (fiance at the time) took a one credit course which taught her a variety of ballroom dance styles. She loved it!",

A person who's been in the club previously will make a routine and you'll be able to go for the first week to as many as you want and then only commit to the routines you want to do after that first week trial. It's for experienced to beginners depending on the choreographer. It's a fun club a good way to meet people from what I understand. \n\nThe classes are kind of a waste since you have to pay for them if they're not part of your major (unless your filling a 1 or 2 credit gap, 13 credits costs the same as 15 credits). \n\nNot sure about the dance team though, dont know anything about them.",

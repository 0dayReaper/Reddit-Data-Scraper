    "postText": "The GVSU Regional Math and Science Center is host to the Region 12 (Kent, Ottawa and Muskegon) Michigan Science Olympiad tournament, the biggest in the state and sometimes the country. Our office can't run it without volunteers. The tournament is fully-in person this year, and will have nearly 700 students participating in 40+ events. The event takes place on March 19th.\n\nIf you have time (or know someone that does) please take a look at the volunteer opportunities below. Many of the events are run by GVSU faculty that you may know!\n\n[https://mso.volunteerlocal.com/volunteer/](https://mso.volunteerlocal.com/volunteer/)\n\nFind out more about the tournament at [https://www.gvsu.edu/msor12/](https://www.gvsu.edu/msor12/)",

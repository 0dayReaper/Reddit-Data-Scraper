I have office hours that are posted, or you can grab my email from the https://www.cis.gvsu.edu/faculty/ webpage.  This time of year can feel especially challenging with midterm exams approaching.  Happy to discuss your thoughts on the major, career pathways, or potential alternatives as well.",

It isn't endorsed by the School, but many profs are there as well as alumni and current students.  During the past two years it has really grown into a community and you can ask questions of other computing students.  I've seen some excellent discussions there about career options, directions, and such.  If you send me an email from your student account I can send you a link.  If you'd prefer not to connect reddit identities then if you talk to a few upperclass students I'm sure someone can get you an invite.",

If you don\u2019t understand a particular line of code and what it\u2019s doing, just go down the rabbit hole on google. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t interested in it, well you can\u2019t really change that. Consider switching to a less technical major like MIS or IS, lots of good jobs available in those fields too.",

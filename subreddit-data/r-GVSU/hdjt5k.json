Even if classes are really in person, I think any social distancing measures will fall apart in 3 weeks. People simply don't care about keeping themselves and others safe anymore and some people never cared.\n\nI'm not deciding anything housing-wise until I know the University's plans and how they impact my courses.\n\nEdit: Just to remind people of the [academic calendar](https://www.gvsu.edu/registrar/academiccalendar.htm#BD262BEF-991E-E631-BB83C2857E4F63B2), tuition payment isn't due until August 21st. You can get a full refund through September 4th and a 75% refund through the 25th. In theory, if things don't work out in the first month you may be able to get something back.",

I signed 12 month lease a couple weeks ago because I thought I\u2019d have the option to do all in person classes (only bc I struggle a lot with online ones).

All that does is piss people off and with the ability to get a full refund it does nothing to help with revenue from tuition payments. I think they are still planning on in person classes but are leaving the option for online classes open if something happens, like say a spike in new cases. Most universities know what theyll be doing in the fall, and i think GV does as well.",

Also no way would I pay full tuition for online-only classes.  \n\nThey need to be publishing guidance on what specifically will be refunded if they later announce that they\u2019re moving to online-only this Fall.",

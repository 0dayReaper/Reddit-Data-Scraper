If you need help working through stuff I would also recommend the Counseling Center.\n\nI am deeply sorry for whatever you are going through. Please know that you aren't alone, you can find people that will help support you, and there are people that care about you. Please be safe. Life is hard but it does get better, you've made it this far and you can keep going. Please don't ever doubt that you are amazing in your own way and that you can get through anything even if it feels like the whole world is falling apart.",

I've tried to see if people care and I only get hurt reaching out. I have literally no one to talk to. No fucking knows me and nobody fucking cars  and I'm sick of strangers telling me people care when they don't know me.",

For the first 2-3 sessions all he did was ask questions about me but by the next session he'd have forgotten everything except whatever few things he wrote in his notes. By the third or so session he finally had something to contribute but it really didn't feel like it related to anything I was struggling with. Then covid happened and I stopped going, but it's not like I was getting anything out of it anyways. \n\nI hope things get better for you soon.",

I can't tell you what your experience will be like, but I will say find a counselor who will listen to you and make you feel heard (+ give good advice).\n\nI had three different counselors over the span of 4 years for different reasons; one of them I dropped after 1 session because I didn't think we were gonna click, and the other two were wonderful.\n\nI hope your situation improves.",

My time at GVSU was one of the hardest in my life and ten years later I still think about those days where it felt like all I could do was cry. For what it's worth and to my genuine shock, I survived the unknown and came out on the other side a far stronger and more capable person. I fully believe you can do this, even though you might feel like you can't.\n\nOne. Day. At. A. Time. Failing that, one hour at a time. One minute, even. \n\nYou got this. You ARE loved.",

I used to go to the older buildings like Lake Huron. \n\nWill be difficult with the weather, but there are trails behind Arboretum as mentioned above and behind Kistler that lead into the woods. \n\nMaybe reserve a room at the library? Take a book and just enjoy the quiet..\n\nI hope things get better!!!",

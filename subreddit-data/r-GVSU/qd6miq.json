    "postText": "I am transferring to GVSU in this winter and I was wondering if it is worth it to buy a parking pass or just take the Laker Line to and from campus? I plan on living off campus in vicinity of the Standale Trail Station. Seems like the better choice to ride the bus but just wanted other peoples opinions!",

            "comment": "I live in GR and take the laker line every day. I highly suggest it. Saves gas (and money) and although you may have to wake up 10 minutes early to get to class on time, the ride is actually pretty relaxing. I\u2019ve met a few cool professors and other students as well. \n\nThis and the fact I\u2019m pretty sure GVSU is now sold out of/limiting parking passes",

Now I live further from campus and take classes downtown, so the benefit's there since I don't live on the bus line. I'd say it's 100% worth it to skip the payment and just take the bus if you have the means to do it.",

You can risk it for the biscuit (I do) and not pay a 5$ parking pass fee at bk and park for free.. it\u2019s right next to devos so the walk to seidman or any of the downtown campuses are only 5-10 minutes max. What I did was buy a pass from bk for 5 bucks and I just hide the pass under some paper on my dash so they can see the pass still but not the dates, so far it\u2019s worked fine for me lol.",

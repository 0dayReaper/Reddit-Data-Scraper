    "postText": "Hi, not sure if there's a spot where I'm missing it, but I'm currently enrolled in PSY 330 (Foundations of Behavioral Neuroscience) and just noticed that the class switched to an online format - I've had enough online classes last year to last me a lifetime, and I'd prefer to switch to a class that is in-person. The only problem is that my Degree Works has PSY 330 in it so it's not showing me the other options that I have to fulfill the Biological requirement for my major. Is there a way I can find out before having to email someone? And if I need to email someone would I just email my advisor?\n\nSorry if the post is confusing at all, just looking to switch before the semester starts. Thanks in advance for any help :)  \n\n\n\\*\\*Edit: I should also mention that my PSY 330 class currently does not have an instructor so would it be possible that it would go back to in-person?",

I think 2 people on the groupme failed or were like super close to failing. Also she is trash at accommodations and I think got reported by someone in the semester I took with her. The other prof is supposedly better.\n\nBe prepared to make 500 flash cards and try to memorize everything lol",

The material was strictly theoretical and although the professor showed us equations he made sure to let us know we wouldn\u2019t need to use them, he just wanted to show us how they were used and to enlightenment us to its existence.\nThe class/lab was long because of the condensed nature. It met from 5-11PM. Labs were in lot D8 (if that lot still has the trailers in them, those are filled with the telescopes), or they were held in a computer lab when skies were overcast. \n\nAs someone who had an interest in science and astronomy but was studying something completely different (music), I enjoyed it as my lab science.",

I ended up doing decent in the course due to the pandemic shifting things to be virtual. However prior to it being virtual we did observe the sky mainly in the morning but we didn't really see much at all due to the lights in the parking lot being on which is not the instructors falt.  Looking at the sky is part of the course requirements from what I recalled as the professor did host observations for students to attend and receive credit. I did like it just because it was an interesting course topic and whatnot. I would say for myself personally it was a difficult course as physics is not a strong suit of mine. I should also say I took it my freshman year in the winter so the pandemic shifted how this course was taught and sorta how my grade improved as the prof canceled our final in exchanged for doing a final project which was much easier to do IMO.",

    "postText": "I work in Kleiner campus dining and have a shift keeping the dining room clean. PLEASE STOP MOVING FURNITURE! THE CHAIRS AND TABLES ARE THERE FOR A REASON. If you decide to have a big group (your not supposed to but we can't do anything to stop you, find a long table or booth or atleast have the decency to put chairs back where you found them). Also people have to wipe down your table after you touch it, and so many people come and go, we already have to keep track of that so having to move furniture slows us down and we lose track of what tables have been sat on. I had a group of kids push 5 small round tables together that were spread far apart to make a longer table. I had to pull them all and drag them back to there place. Its my job, whatever I can't stop you but its kinda rude please don't be that person. If you can, try to pick a table before you sit there also.",

            "comment": "This sounds very stressful. Tbh the advice I have to give that I think you should follow is just to quit and find a job anywhere else, but campus dining. If you have too and can't immediately quit due to financial issues then start applying and then just switch once you get hired somewhere else. All the fast food areas off campus pay more. Meijer pays way better than campus dining too. My point is though that this job has always been garbage and more work than those other places, and as stated previously campus dining just pays like shit with just minimum wage. While the people not wiping tables and not moving back the chairs might be not nice, or great I really am not going to say I can feel bad for you if you decide to stay working at kleiner. This is some tough love to have, but I really want the best for you by urging you to definitely ditch this shitty option for something that is way better. Another thing you can do whether or not you leave is to complain and suggest to your managers to hire people to work on keeping the chairs in order and the tables wiped. Really as a customer the customers really shouldn't have to be expected to have to wipe their table. That should be something the workers should be doing. CD should really just get folks to be designated just for wiping and keeping chairs in the same spots",

I would reccomend mennas but the owner is insane and it's 100% shut down now anyways\n\nThere are other better places to work in 48west, on lake mich drive (the pub pays well), and along the bus routes. The liquor stores used to be perpetually hiring. \n\nImo the people at CD only work there so they never have to leave campus. Idk why anyone would work there otherwise",

That there are better choices and I would absolutely consider them if I was op.

It still just boils down to not needing to leave campus and always being right by home. Just was making trash for money and wasn't studying enough so I dipped.",

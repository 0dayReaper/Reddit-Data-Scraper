Also, like they are trying to make people forget about the current case number dashboard they were going to put up. Like \u201chey you\u2019ll know if you come into contact with someone testing positive; what more do you need to know?\u201d Plus, it all depends on people putting in that they tested positive voluntarily...",

Could be legit because it was created in march, but the whois data is anonymous and using Gmail for mail server + AWS for hosting so there's no visible way to verify.\n\nBest solution: Call your campus I.T. and they can answer.\n\nEdit: Do any of the links go in any strange directions (Don't click, just mouse over for the tool-tip)? Is the from address from a GVSU address?",

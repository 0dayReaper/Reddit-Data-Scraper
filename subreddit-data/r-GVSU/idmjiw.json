It basically states that only those that live on campus are allowed in on campus living centers, and only during certain hours. Overnight guests are also now not allowed. Interesting how this was swept under the rug pretty well.",

Many universities made the decision to forego fall break and go online after thanksgiving as early as April. So why are all of these big decisions just being made now at GVSU?",

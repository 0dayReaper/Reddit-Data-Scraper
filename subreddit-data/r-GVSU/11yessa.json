    "postText": "I don't know if this is the right place to ask. I am graduating this June with honors degree in computing from a college that is affiliated to London metropolitan university. My situation is that the honors degree that I am currently enrolled in is of 3 years.   \n\n\nI want to apply for masters in CS at GVSU. But I am unsure if I am eligible due to my 3 years honors degree. I have written an email to admission office and it has been 2 days but I have not received any response. Maybe I should have little more patience.   \n\n\nIf anyone could clear my question it would be great help.",

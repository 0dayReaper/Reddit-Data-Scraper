Hopefully I\u2019ll hear from them sometime this week.\n\nedit/update:\n\nOne of the members of the virus action team reached out to me and TL;DR the first 2 times was just chance (sampling with replacement). This week, I was selected more purposefully since they're focusing on my apartment complex for testing. My understanding is they're slowing cycling through the off campus apartments for more thorough testing.",

I don\u2019t think you have to give a reason, you just let them know you\u2019re not going to participate.\n\nThat said, if they truly are doing random testing (not sure this is really what\u2019s happening), if people aren\u2019t compelled to comply the process can lose some of its integrity by leaving them with only people that want to be tested or don\u2019t care if they are. Being able to opt out means that people that should be tested might not be. \n\nI\u2019m not necessarily for mandatory random tests, but there can be some negative consequences of allowing opt outs. Although, for faculty &amp; staff it could be seen as no different than mandatory drug screening that many companies do.",

More wiping down of equipment is done by everyone. I went today 10am and it was a bit busier than last semester but i assume it is those new yr resolution goals starting",

There are signs that say \u201cwipe equipment before and after use\u201d - from what I\u2019ve seen people don\u2019t typically wipe before, but I haven\u2019t ever seen someone skimp on wiping down the equipment after they\u2019re done.",

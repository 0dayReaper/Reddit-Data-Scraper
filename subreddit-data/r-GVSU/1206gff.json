    "postText": "So I got a scholarship for this school which would make it very affordable but I also got into another school that is dedicated to art and increases your chances of getting a good job in the industry. That school however is so expensive I'm now looking at this school. I looked up youtube videos but none of them really go into detail about whether or not the art program helped their art skills or their chances of getting a job in the art industry. So for anybody who majored in art, mainly if you chose to emphasize illustration, how was your experience?",

And if the teachers don't like your work from the first year, they won't allow you to move onto year two classes, will have to take all the year one stuff again. I'd say use the scholarship to do all your gen eds then transfer somewhere else.",

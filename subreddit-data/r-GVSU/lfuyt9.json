Generally this is more expensive than going through post office.  \n\nBest bet price-wise is Post Office.  You can buy postage online and and print the label.  You can drop off Post Office packages with labels in the basement of the Laker Store as well.",

The Lakerstore does have some mailing supplies (like padded envelopes) upstairs for sale.",

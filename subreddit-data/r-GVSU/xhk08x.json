I lived at Copper back in the day (showing my age a bit, yikes) and that was known as the party complex, mostly because the security was pretty lax. It was like adult Halloween - going from apartment to apartment because \"someone I know there knows someone having a party at KK106\" or whatever. Saw plenty of alcohol-induced stupidity then too.\n\nMSU isn't a dry campus, but Cedar Village becomes a lawless land of fights and flaming couches from time to time too. If any school or city wants to crack down on this stuff, they need to have a near-zero tolerance policy for noise, open containers and general rowdiness in the apartment complexes. That wasn't the case when I was there, and doesn't seem to be the case now.",

    "postText": "EDIT: Thank you all for your responses, since they are both stem majors, I do only get one degree, but I get 2 if I get 150 credits. It\u2019s kinda lame, like I finished both majors already and my gen-eds, you\u2019re telling me I can\u2019t get another degree unless I get 30 more credits? I could just take 30 credits of workout classes for that.\n\nI double majored in mathematics and statistics and I was not able to create the time to walk. Anyways, I waited in the mail and only got one degree, a bachelors of science. Is there only one degree for this, or are they shipped separate and I should be expecting another one?\n\nThank you!",

At the time it was a communications program, not an art program, and taking three statistics classes could earn you a B.S., or three language classes for a B.A. I had both but chose the B.A.",

    "postText": "If you are not from the area, and think you might end up working while attending college away from home, make sure to bring your social security card or passport with you when you move to campus. Employers (including GV) need to verify original documents when a person gets hired and I\u2019ve had that hold some student\u2019s start date up because they didn\u2019t have it with them. (This is for the I9 form and the full list of acceptable ID is printed on the form, but social security cards and passports are just the most common I see.)",

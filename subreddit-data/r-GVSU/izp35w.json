    "postText": "I live in the South E apartments and the wifi, if I can even get connected, is so horrible in my apartment that I just end up using data most of the time. Is there anything that can be done about this or any way to have it fixed?\n\nEDIT: If you are having wifi issues, going to the IT support site and starting a live chat with a technician will allow you to fill out a support ticket and hopefully have it looked at.\n\nEDIT 2: Not even 24hrs after filling out the ticket two engineers were at my apartment fixing the issue. Having spoke with them, they want you to report these wifi issues to the IT desk, and they want to come out and fix it. Very friendly and understanding folks. Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to them. \n\nhttps://www.gvsu.edu/it/",

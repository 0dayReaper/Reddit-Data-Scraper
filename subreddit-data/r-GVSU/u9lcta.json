    "postText": "Hello everyone, I hope the prep for finals week is going well!  \n\n\nI am looking for student or staff sources who are willing to give an opinion regarding the idea of sports betting on college campuses for a paper I am working on in CMJ 310.   \n\n\nMore specifically, I am talking about a recent deal between Caesars Sportsbook and Michigan State University. \n\n[https://msuspartans.com/news/2022/1/13/general-caesars-sportsbook-named-official-sports-betting-igaming-partner-of-michigan-state-athletics.aspx](https://msuspartans.com/news/2022/1/13/general-caesars-sportsbook-named-official-sports-betting-igaming-partner-of-michigan-state-athletics.aspx)  \n\n\nIf anyone has used a sports betting site like FanDuel or DraftKings (Preferably if you have used Caesars but that is okay) and are willing to participate in an 8-10 minute interview it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

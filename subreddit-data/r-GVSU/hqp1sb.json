(Technically a class is hybrid if more than 1/6 of the in-person meetings are replaced by online work; in practice it's more like 50/50.) \n\nThat's the basic flavors. But beyond this, _any_ online portion of a class can be further divided into **synchronous** (the work is online but happening together in real time) or **asynchronous** (the work is online and there is no fixed schedule for the work). \n\nSo yes, a synchronous class is online because it's entirely online. You'll see it in Banner because it says \"online\" and it lists meeting times.",

Ordinarily a 4-credit class would meet 4 hours a week (probably TR 10-12 in your case). But since you can't get the entire roster of students into a regular classroom at the same time and still meet social distancing restrictions, the class is being broken into two sub-sections -- Groups A and B -- and the face-to-face meetings will be staggered, with Group A meeting face-to-face in the classroom on TR 10-11 and then Group B meeting Face-to-face in the classroom 11-12. Since it's only half the roster, it will be possible to meet face-to-face in a classroom under social distancing restrictions. \n\nThat only accounts for two of the four hours of the course, so the \"balance\" of the coursework is going to be done asynchronously online. The details of that will depend on your prof. For my courses for instance, I'll be taking the active learning work I'd usually give in class and having students do it at home instead, interacting with a study group on our discussion board and turned in by the end of the week. \n\nThis whole thing is going to make a lot more sense when we actually do it in the fall than it does trying to explain it in the abstract now.",

Or, consider moving away from timed testing entirely and base the course grade on a portfolio of problems that are worked out over time. \n\nIt's possible to cheat in that kind of situation; it's possible to cheat in _any_ situation. But it's a lot harder to fake an explanation than it is to fake a computation. And, it's the explanation that matters anyway.",

Courses could still be canceled due to low enrollment, for example, just like they could in the past. I'm a faculty member, and I can't remember a semester when my Fall schedule didn't change between May and August! So, schedules are as final as they can be.\n\nThat said, the big differences now are that a) we are all paying much closer attention because of the uncertainty, and b) a section of a class being canceled could mean a change in the teaching modality. That is a legitimate concern and one folks are aware of and working on.",

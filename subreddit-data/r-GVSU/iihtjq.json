Students are now gonna crowd public places because their classes (especially midday ones) are going online and it either doesnt make sense for them to go home or they cant get home in time to make class. This is especially true for students who have classes on both campuses.",

The library will be at a lower capacity for social distancing and a higher demand at the same time. Fortunately some of the smaller classrooms on campus -- that are too small for socially distanced classes -- are being turned into first come/first served rooms for study. You can find those here:  https://www.gvsu.edu/provost/unscheduled-or-lightly-scheduled-classrooms-reservable-conference-rooms-234.htm\n\nIt's not a lot of rooms, but it's better than nothing.",

Almost all academic buildings have study spaces in little alcoves and hallways throughout the building. For example, the 2nd floor in Mackinac has several alcoves built into the halls. The basement of Padnos has little desks with privacy dividers. These areas aren't governed by any sort of noise-level courtesy - people can meet there, carry on conversations, but the areas are usually pretty low activity while classes are going on. That's one advantage of having almost all classes with the same 10-minute passing time: When people are in class, campus is pretty quiet. It 's usually a bit busier during the first two weeks of the semester, and then things settle down.\n\nYou can also go to the department that houses your major and ask them if they have a majors only study area. Many of them do, and these are quite private.  \n\n\nETA: The library is not a \"quiet\" library. There are some areas reserved for silent activities, but it's a busy space that expects conversation, collaboration, and noise, so don't rule out the library, either!",

At this point, it sounds like many courses have transitioned to online, but it also sounds like many courses will be traditionally taught as well. Personally, I have a mix of both. Assuming students have back to back classes, many many kids are going to have in person courses one hour, and online synchronous courses the next. That is unavoidable. \n\nSo all the online students will swarm the library/empty classrooms/major specific study areas and come into close contact with each other, completely negating the purpose of having courses online. \n\n\nI don\u2019t want to hijack your comment, but I haven\u2019t seen anyone mention this and I feel like it needs to be seriously discussed.",

If they feel it necessary to join forces with landlords to make students do what they want, are canceling fall break, and then encouraging all classes to go online in November anyway, why in gods name are they going through all of this expense (and charging us for it) just to keep a handful of students on campus?  It makes no sense to me at all.",

All apartment complexes off campus are NOT affiliated with GVSU whatsoever and legally speaking don't have to do anything. As a previous employee of two off campus housing complexes in Allendale, GVSU HATES them and wants nothing to do with them. They make it hard to market on campus, make them pay to be able to market at sporting events, and all around make their lives difficult. So now GVSU wants the apartments to help them out? Yeah good luck with that. Why would a complex potentially make a resident unhappy and run the risk of them no resigning if it means GVSU, who hasn't helped them out at all in the past, gets their way? I get there is a moral obligation but I doubt they will.",

When my university first announced returning for fall they eliminated our fall break and announced we will not return after thanksgiving, so I\u2019m a little shocked GV is just now deciding to go this route. However, I will be surprised if many universities end up being open for in person courses even at the time of the originally scheduled fall break.",

GV is a big feeder school for STEM fields in West Michigan, emphasis on science (medicine) and engineering.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what year you are in but if I were still in college I would consider taking courses through GRCC if I had Gen Ed\u2019s and pre-reqs that I could check off.\n\nEdit: on tuition \u2014 I read that the tuition increase is being countered by an increase in financial aid and that 90% of student qualify for some form of financial aid so really a tuition increase will only be realized by the top 10% of students and their families. If you\u2019re not in that segment of the population, you should see a net decrease in tuition.\n\nSecond edit: now you have me digging in. It looks like the \u201cworking with landlords\u201d is about enforcing the gatherings of 10 people or less rule... which in theory their rent a cops should already be doing under the state emergency orders. It\u2019s mentioned [here](https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/my-laker-pledge-33.htm)",

I don't have the data for last winter because I wasn't able to attend but it looks like from fall of 2019 to now the cost for me went up $14 per credit, that combined with the increase in parking from $230 to $240 (I miss that $80 CMU charge more and more these days lol) that means I'll have payed an extra $150 per semester this year.   Not a ton, admittedly, and I know tuition income is likely down because not everyone is returning.  I'll say I understand why they increased the tuition a bit, from a business standpoint it makes sense, but I'm still not super fond of being charged standard tuition fees for things I wont be utilizing this year.",

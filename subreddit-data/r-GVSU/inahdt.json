Basically swirl the swab in each nostril for 10 seconds. Much easier and less uncomfortable then a covid test I had a couple months ago at a drive up spectrum testing location when it felt like she was scrapping the back of my head through my nose with a big qtip. The self test just makes your eyes water a little.",

If you have any of the symptoms, been exposed to anyone who was positive or were told to self quarantine they don't want you to be apart of the \"random\" testing. So how can they even call it random",

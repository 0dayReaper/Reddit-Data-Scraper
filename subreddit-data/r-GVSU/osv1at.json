    "postText": "Hey guys! This upcoming semester I'll have to take the Laker Line, which I've never done before. I was able to find the actual times the buses leave, but I haven't really found any websites that list how long a ride usually lasts between the Allendale and Downtown Pew Campuses. Could anyone who's taken the Laker Line before give me an estimate as to how long a ride usually lasts? Thanks!\n\nUPDATE: Thanks for the info everyone! It was super helpful :)",

Trust me, you need it. \n\nThe first 15 minutes are for getting to a Laker Line bus stop and waiting for it to come, the next 30 minutes is when you're on the actual bus, and the last 15 minutes is for getting from the bus to where you gotta go. \n\nDo this and you'll practically never be late.",

Sometimes you will get two buses back to back and sometimes they run like clockwork, perfectly and evenly spaced. An hour is your best bet to be prepared.",

The bus ride itself is normally 25-30min depending on traffic/weather, but I added 15min to count walking to bus stop and then walking from bus stop to class. As someone else mentioned, maybe an 1 hour total to be safe. I promise it all goes by fast and won\u2019t feel like an hour of travel.",

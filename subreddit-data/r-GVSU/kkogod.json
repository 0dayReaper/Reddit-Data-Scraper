    "postText": "Hey GVSU pre-meds, I am an MD/MBA student applying to ophthalmology. In my experience from four admissions cycles (college, MD, MBA, residency), I realize how helpful that guidance can be through the application process. For that reason, I have started a pre-med business with two services:\n\n1. Med School Application Consulting \u2013 Personal Statement and Secondary Application Revision, School Selection, Interview Prep, etc.\n2. Pre-Med Advising \u2013 Tailored advice on planning college, GPA, MCAT, and extracurricular activities\n\nOver the past six months, I have conducted Zoom meetings with more than ten pre-med students to give advice, revise essays, and conduct mock interviews. Because I am free through the end of December, I am offering a free 30-minute session for application consulting (application writing, interview prep, etc.) and half-off any pre-med advising session. Please shoot me a message to learn more or set up a meeting.",

GVSU offers mock interviews and r/premed will answer any questions you have.\n\nPremeds, unless you're on your fourth app cycle or something, don't pay for advising.",

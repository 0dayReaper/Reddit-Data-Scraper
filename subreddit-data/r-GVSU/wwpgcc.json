Both are income contingent of a single file &lt;$125,000 a year.  If you are still a dependent under your parent(s)/guardian(s) the income contingency is dependent on their income.\n\nWanting to clarify for those who only read a title and comments but not the full release.  An application will be available before the new loan repayment freeze is over (so no later than 12/31/2022) which will be necessary to complete if the department of education does not have your salary available.",

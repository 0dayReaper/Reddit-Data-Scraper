Any suggestions/recommendations from the community of decent places to work in GR hiring full-time seasonal work? Even better - any places offering over $13/hour and/or tuition reimbursement? Thanks so much!",

The position can go as long as November (depending on seasonal needs in the fall). The scheduling is really flexible and the people you work with are usually awesome! I loved it when I did it last summer",

Slept through one and no motivation to go to the other. Currently laying on the ground curled up in a blanket like a fucking loser. No energy to get dressed eat or shower. I fucking hate it here so much. My fam would be so disappointed in me and mad and my gf couldn\u2019t give a shit. I fucking hate this school so much",

From everything I've seen, it seems campus is pretty rough right now, and I don't think you're alone in how you're feeling.\n\nThis may or may not be helpful, but I'd [highly recommend this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GVSU/comments/iqx8lz/resources_for_those_in_need/) from the other day with some resources that could help if you're feeling depressed. Teletherapy is an option that I highly recommend if you're feeling down or anxious (I say this as someone who does it almost every week).\n\nIf you need someone to rant to, shoot me a DM.",

I just focus on my classes to get me through the day and other days I have no energy and just cry:( talk to family at home it will help you feel a little better and bring some comfort. No one blames you for how you are feeling right now",

Please stay healthy. The world is hyper focused on COVID but we should be equally (if not more so) focused on our mental health as well.",

I\u2019ve definitely struggled a lot with school a lot as well; and this comes from someone who says that they embrace change. It\u2019s not easy. It will continue to be rough but you have to do your best to think of all the good things you have in life: I know it can be difficult, especially when you compare it to what could have been just 6 months/ a year earlier. But just know that you still have resources and are surviving.",

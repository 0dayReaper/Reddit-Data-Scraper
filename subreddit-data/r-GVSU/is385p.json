I feel super uncomfortable going on campus to the testing site where it\u2019s probably a cesspool of germs. But I still want to participate, but I also want it to be free. Any suggestions?",

They screened me at the entrance, there were plenty of workers from Spectrum there so I only had to wait about 3 minutes, everyone was in appropriate PPE, there was hand sanitizer everywhere. The only time I came closer to anyone than 6 feet was when they handed me the swab and then I put it back into the vial. I was inside for a total of about 6 minutes, and I actually left the building before my appointment was even scheduled to start.",

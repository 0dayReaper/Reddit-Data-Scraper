There's a theory going around that they're only doing repeat tests of people that had negative tests before. My boyfriend has been tested five times now, all negative. He knows someone that's tested positive and hasn't heard a call back in a month. Apparently there's a lot of that sort of trend going around campus, which makes people think they're boosting their negative numbers. Not gonna fully believe that little conspiracy theory, but I don't think campus is entirely done with COVID yet either.",

            "comment": "Just gonna throw this out there. I think that part, and I stress part, of the abrupt decline is because GVSU is seemingly making it harder for people to make the testing times and not allowing off campus testing anymore. I missed my test this week because I literally couldn\u2019t find a time to make their testing times and I live off campus. Cases are going down, but I think there is still virus in the GV community that will inevitably show up when people get their families sick.",

The whole reason we are starting on Jan 19 is to have a 14 day period after the normal winter break to be able to isolate (and they may even require a test) before you come back. Ofc not everyone will follow this so there may be a spike.",

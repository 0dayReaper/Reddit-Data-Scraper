    "postText": "Hello, I'm a future transfer student and this fall will be my first semester at GVSU and my first year of not being a commuter student.\n\nI was looking at the meal plans for on campus and I've found that most of them are really expensive, like a decent one is from $1,800-2,000 a semester. From what I've researched, that comes out to $8+ per meal for only about 1-2 meals a day, and most on campus dining locations are only opened for limited hours.\n\nI feel like this is all really overpriced unless I'm missing something, and honestly it looks like it'd be cheaper to just get fast food or buy my own groceries. On top of that I can get what I actually want and not just cafeteria quality food for every meal.\n\nGVSU really pushes the meal plans and I've had people tell me that the convenience is worth the price. But I'm already a commuter student who buys their own groceries, and if I really want to eat on campus I figured I can load dining dollars onto my card and just buy what I want for about the same price.\n\nI was wondering what your experience has been with the meal plans. Do you use one, and has it been worth it? Is there something I'm missing?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses! I think I worded it awkwardly but I meant to say that this fall I will be living on campus (Laker Village specifically) but for spring/summer I am currently a commuter student. I was just saying that for context since I've only ever commuted and bought groceries I didn't know if I should get a meal plan when I move to campus.",

If you live on campus, don't own a car, and don't like to cook, you'll probably be happy that you bought one. As a commuter student, I agree that there are better options for you. Some have suggested loading dining dollars but you can honestly just pay with a debit card if you decide to eat on campus now and again. Depending where you're commuting from, there are many fast food options that are likely cheaper dollar-for-dollar than paying for a meal plan or using dining dollars at CD locations. And if you have a car to commute, you can likely just visit the grocery store, which is the cheapest (and healthiest) option. I don't think meal plans are completely worthless, but some people will get more value out of it and I don't think it's best for you specifically.",

Especially if you are already comfortable cooking and buying your own groceries. Also Laker village units usually have basic amenities like microwaves and ovens that you only need to share with your roommates if you have any. However, I think it really depends on how the timing works out for you between being at home and being on campus. Campus dining has changed a lot since the pandemic happened IMO. Things use to be open more often and more locations were operating. My advice is make your decision based on your schedule to see if you need to stay on campus throughout the day.\n\nAlso while it can be hit or miss, Daily Deals comes in handy. Also Aldi is a great way to save and still get quality food. If you have the means and the time, I\u2019d go to Aldi for any essentials and Meijer or Family Fare for whatever else you may need.",

If you  ride the bus you have Burger King and Taco Bell a quick ride away. If you have a car there are lots more places nearby. For $5 you can get a 4 piece pizza and a soda at Little Caeser's or hit the deli at Family Fare and get ribs, chicken tenders, potato wedges, mac n' cheese, mashed potatoes, salads, sushi, or any number of microwave meals in the grocery area. I ate breakfast at Burger King 3 days a week and lunch around town or microwaving something from Family Fare every day for an entire semester and didn't spend more than $1000.",

The only good meal plan is the unlimited and it\u2019s only good for the dorms where you don\u2019t have a kitchen (and if you work out a lot and eat 4+ meals a day). Dining dollars literally do nothing but tie your money up in campus dining, you might as well keep that money in your bank account and then you can use it as you see fit.",

I switched to the 5/week and it worked out way better, plus I went to the grocery store for the basics. It really is all about convenience. The meals are super expensive on campus anyways so if you don\u2019t have a meal plan I wouldn\u2019t get the meals. Dining dollars are also kind of pointless at that point as well because the pod stores on campus are overly priced. If you can\u2019t cook or go shopping then I\u2019d get a meal plan but otherwise I wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m living on campus again next year and won\u2019t be getting one. Also, if you have any kind of food allergies it\u2019ll be more difficult with limited options. Campus dining was kind of a joke this past school year.",

    "postText": "I am 30 credits in to my master\u2019s program and have one 3 credit capstone class left that is required to graduate. I was told at some point in the last two years that it would be offered this summer. When I tried to register on Monday, I found out that it is not only not offered this summer, but also not offered the following fall and winter semesters. My advisor does not know when it will be offered. I was told to check back in a month.\n\nWhat in the what?! Am I wrong to be upset about this? Is this normal? \n\nI don\u2019t have a good sense of how many students are in my program but I certainly can\u2019t be the only one. As far as I can tell on Banner, this class has not been offered since I started the program two years ago. This doesn\u2019t make sense to me with respect to timing of completion of the program for both full time and part time students.",

Substitutions can be made with the approval of the GPD or Chair. The GPD will then contact the registrar\u2019s office to make the change in your MyPath. My guess is that there are some major curricular changes happening in your program and they haven\u2019t been formally approved yet. Don\u2019t contact the Dean of your college, you probably won\u2019t get a response.",

I am working in my field and have several years of experience and credentials related to the field, so I thought maybe that could count for something instead of the capstone class. I\u2019ve heard of other schools offering something like that for working professionals, but am not sure if that applies here.",

Many times, people just know how to do their job, but not why certain decisions are made or do not know how to navigate situations like this. Your program should have a Dean and I would reach out to their office ASAP. Here are some factors to share: you are unable to earn in the field of your choice because of the delays in offering the class which is delaying your financial health in several ways including life choices, earning potential, and personal fulfillment. You are willing to complete an alternate course and it is on the college to accommodate you since the class has not been offered in two years. If they can not accommodate your request then you will be contacting a lawyer due to the fact you have paid for an academic program that is incomplete. This is all assuming that you have done your due diligence and have not had an opportunity to take the class in the last two years which you passed on.",

    "postText": "I have a couple questions that I'm hoping can maybe be answered here so I can possibly avoid some phone calls lol. I'm an early college student that applied as a freshman for next Fall with 61 college credits (junior academic standing), so would I go to the freshman orientation or transfer orientation? I will be taking taking junior-level classes, so that's where I'm sort of confused.\nAlso, I went to apply for housing (I'm looking for a vansteeland 2 BR apartment) and it listed a first-year housing application. Since it is my first year at GV, I'm not sure if this is the terminology they use for freshmen or first-time residents. I qualify for upperclassmen housing, so I don't want to mess it up.\nI know these questions may not be answered here, just wanna give it a shot!",

As for classes, I had to request exemptions for a couple that had junior requirements but they took care of that for me at orientation where you sign up for all your classes. As for housing, we also had to request and exemption from the housing department in order to live off campus/on campus apartments instead of dorms. Just explain to them that your in early college and are coming in with all those credits. Didn\u2019t cause much trouble for me.",

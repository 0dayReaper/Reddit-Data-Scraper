Weather that was during the spring or this semester, I want to know if anyone was able to qualify. I had an on-campus job so I only had part time hours, but I did work full-time in the before this current semester.",

But I was denied because apparently I don\u2019t make enough money. I\u2019ve only worked part-time since 2017. I was able to qualify for PUA (Pandemic Unemployment Assistance). However, after following the necessary steps for PUA I haven\u2019t heard anything and haven\u2019t seen a single penny. So not sure what\u2019s going on with that.",

I remember back in the summer when I wasn\u2019t receiving some my funds, I was able to reach the unemployment offices over the phone after spam calling for ~25 minutes. After speaking with them for a few minutes, I received payment 2 days later.",

Haven\u2019t seen any money yet and they closed my PUA claim October 3rd for some reason. \n\nI could really use the money. I\u2019ve only been making about $100 a month and i\u2019ve got a $256 car loan to pay each month and don\u2019t forget about groceries. I eat gluten free due to Celiac which is expensive. I\u2019ve been using that $1200 stimulus check plus my student loan refund to make do, but my money is slowly running out.",

I also immediately started to receive payments for a few months until I indicated on one of my weekly certifications that I started school again in September and boy, that put my claim on a hold for months and I haven't been able to get any more money after that. My advice is to try if you think you could qualify. The worse answer you can get is no. On your application, Answer everything truthfully and be ready and able to provide documentation. I heard they are starting to require people to bring proof of identity to upload. Feel free to ask anymore questions.",

You may get some individuals who are quick to throw you to the side. Stay vigilant and keep trying to contact them, you'll eventually come across the right person. My main method of contacting UIA is by chat. To avoid getting kicked out of chat immediately, you do the overnight trick where you open up the chat box preceding the conversation and leave it up over the night. Enter your information before 8 AM (This is when UIA opens their offices for business) and click submit just as the clock turns 8. You will be talking to someone there or pretty soon.",

            "comment": "I worked for Campus Dining at the Connection for a little under 3 months and right when school closed which was around the 13th of March we all were told that we would be out of jobs and should file for unemployment. Specifically though, we were told to file a PUA application not the actual unemployment application as regular unemployment is only for legit jobs or something like that. They said because I was working for a school or university at the college I was attending that I could not qualify for regular unemployment. Once I was allowed the PUA benefits I was receiving 680ish dollars every 2 weeks I think which in total ran all the way up until July. I was able to make some 9000ish dollars. Because the PUA benefits have been expired for about 4 or so months since July, I do not know if you can still qualify for it. It's worth a try though. You could never know.",

If you had a full-time position when COVID started, you're likely entitled to some sort of unemployment assuming you have proof of previous employment and your wages were higher than like $100 a week. They'll only pay out if you had a significant change in income, so if you were previously making very little they'll assume you have support coming from elsewhere. \n\nThat's my experience and perception, at least.",

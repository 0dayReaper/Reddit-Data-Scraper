We have tons of extremely knowledgeable professors, some of my favorite being Zinman, Constantelos, and Walker. I also chose to minor in Human Rights, and those classes were exceptionally fun, too (Prof Zivi is AWESOME). It\u2019s a good degree but don\u2019t major in it unless you think you know what direction you want to go in post graduation. I work for the State of MI now, but it was scary having such an open ended degree. I do recommend it though!",

I will say that as someone who leans a little more toward the right on a few issues that I felt tense at times when it came to hot ticket issues\u2026 but, lucky the majority of the curriculum is encircling things that aren\u2019t necessarily left up to opinion. I haven\u2019t taken nearly enough classes to tell you to do it or not, I\u2019m just saying I enjoyed it",

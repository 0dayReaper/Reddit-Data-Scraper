    "postText": "I am an incoming data science graduate student who will be starting at GV this fall. I believe that most of the classes for the program will be located at the Pandos College of Engineering and Computing. I was wondering if anyone had any advise as to where the best places to live would be? Ideally i'd like to be able to walk to class most days but I would be open to driving as well. Are Winter and Secchia halls typically good for graduate students or are they more dorm style for underclassmen? Any feedback would be appreciated.",

            "comment": "If you want on campus housing, Winter and Secchia are both good. They're private bedrooms in apartments of 2-4 bedrooms.\n\nThere are also many off campus options on the west side. The apartment complexes tend to be overpriced, but there are many converted houses or duplexes available for rent. I lived in a place from [Laker Rentals](http://lakerrentals.com/) and really enjoyed it. Good pricing, and the landlord Bob is a great guy.",

The best place to live near campus is probably Evolve ..as  long as you don't get scammed by their horrible staff... but you have to take a bus to get to actual campus from there",

GVSU is also a public university which means the budget is available to anyone. I haven\u2019t looked at it myself but I would love to have someone skim it and point out all the scandalous areas  the money from the raised tuition was wasted.",

[https://www.desmos.com/calculator/k7vysdzt8q](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/k7vysdzt8q)\n\nThat's pretty amazing considering that academic inflation at universities is 3-4% exponential increase nationwide.

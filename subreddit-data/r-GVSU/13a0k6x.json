    "postText": "I'm thinking about majoring in MIS with a CS minor, gearing for a data analyst position. Would it be better to be a CS major or do a data science/stats minor? \n\nMy primary concern is getting internships and income after graduation. Though I enjoy programming, I know software engineering would bore me and I'm more interested in business operations.",

Not a ton of analyst classes in it though.\n\nMIS will give you a BS from the Seidman College if Business",

The degree is in demand and in regards to post-grad income it depends on where you go but as far as I know the big 4 &amp; mid-tier pa consulting field pays 70K+ a year. (There are MANY factors to the salary). I am unsure of industry company salaries. \n\nIf you're interested in data analytics, there's actually a Data Science and Analytics degree at GV.",

I taught in the philosophy department at GVSU several years ago, I'm in a competition to win some money and a feature in a magazine, and I need support from my community. I'm a chef who has been vegan for 12 years, and am also a philosophy PhD candidate who is currently finishing my dissertation entitled \"The Good in Plants: On Food and Hospitality,\" which is an extended argument for placing plants at the center of our food system.\n\nWinning the money and exposure would allow my team and I to start a plant-based market and center for food thought in my hometown of Grand Rapids. We plan on running educational curricula on food justice and ethics, providing a storefront for the many vegan startups in our community, and providing low-cost lunches in our neighborhood.\n\nThe contest organizers told us to involve \"our community,\" and the Laker community is one of those groups for me. Any support you can lend (either voting or sharing with your local friends) would be infinitely appreciated. Thanks in advance and bless y'all:\n\n[https://favchef.com/2021/evan-edwards](https://favchef.com/2021/evan-edwards)",

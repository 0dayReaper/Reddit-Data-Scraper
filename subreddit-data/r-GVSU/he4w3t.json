I mean, the answer is clear but it\u2019s frustrating that everyone just shrugs it off and accepts that as the way things are especially since this is a public university. American universities don\u2019t have nearly enough checks to keep costs reasonable and its really disheartening that it doesn\u2019t seem like things will change anytime soon.",

I personally believe that nobody is under any obligation to give away their money. but youd think that someone who is the president of a very liberal university &amp; makes a disgusting amount of money would publicly do so to help students during something like this\ud83d\ude02",

Administrators taking paycuts the year seems to be the trendy thing at many schools. \n\nWe could argue how much money the president and deans should be donating (and there are plenty of overpaid deans). But even if they all donated 100% of their salary, the overall impact is small. I\u2019d much rather push for transparency in their reopening plan and judge the administration on its feasibility.",

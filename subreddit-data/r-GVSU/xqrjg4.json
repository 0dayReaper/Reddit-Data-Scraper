    "postText": "Hi,   my name is Troy and I'm running for Allendale Public Schools Board of Education. I wanted to take a quick moment and introduce myself and hopefully connect with you. \n\nI live in Allendale with my wife and our 3 kids who all attend aps.  I am very passionate about supporting our teachers and their professional decisions, as well as focusing strongly on inclusion and diversity not only with our students but with our curriculum as well. \n\n  I would be honored if you would take a moment to visit my page, check it out,  and maybe we could connect about areas that you are passionate about.  \n\nThank you! \n\nFacebook.com/troy4apsboard",

I'm not sure If I can vote for this though as I'm not really located in Allendale, but if I can, I most certainly will vote for you.",

And after you graduated from school what involvement have you had directly with public schools that makes you uniquely qualified for this position? (Teaching, subbing, volunteering, etc.?)",

In that sense I feel I have a more rounded grasp of what does belong in a public school and what is more the realm of separation of church and state and belongs in a private setting (materials being banned based on faith issues for example).\n\nI have been directly involved with the current school board, attending monthly and helping to directly create opportunities for policy considerations and changes.  I have also been actively involved with allendale public's superintendent open forum meetings, commonly referred to as \"cookies with cooper \" every month.   I have also engaged myself with volunteer opportunities at every chance.  I have a very good relationship with the elementary pto and have volunteered on an ongoing basis with them.  As well as volunteering with various departments to engage with student programs such as helping the art department display students works for showcases within the school,  and later this week i will be volunteering with the librarians and Scholastic book fairs to engage with students and families in seeking out new reading opportunities.  \n\nI hope this answers your questions, please reach out if you're interested to learn more.  \n\n\nThanks again!",

It is my hope to create a safe and welcoming space for all students regardless of gender, orientation,  ethnicity, or any factors used to create division.  I feel there are some efforts that could be put forth and built upon. For example gender nuetral bathroom options,  and encouraging using preferred pronouns and chosen names are excellent places to start.   Youth self harm and suicide within the lgbtq community is also something I am very passionate about and would like to see additional recognition of this severe issue and effort towards reducing these rates.   I am also firmly against the recent efforts to ban books from educational resources based upon gender/sexual orientation or race issues.  I strongly believe that a more inclusive and diverse educational curriculum creates a more successful student. \n\nI do have some posts on my facebook talking about my stances on de&amp;i, and youth suicide prevention, and a diverse educational experience if have a chance to look around on there.",

On the Lakerline it's far harder to check ID because there are three doors and all are supposed to be used for boarding and exiting.  If you don't have your ID, just get on at the back door and you'll *probably* never have a problem.\n\nNow, on *other* routes, you do need to show your ID. (Yes, for those who don't know, GVSU students/staff get free rides on all Rapid routes.)",

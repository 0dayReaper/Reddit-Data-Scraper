    "postText": "Has anyone noticed some of their online 2020 courses have switched to online. I signed up for in person classes that meet weekly during registration in May and recently noticed that a few of those same courses no longer list in person times but rather online times. Is this an error in the system or on my part, or has GVSU started moving some courses online without notice. Thanks!",

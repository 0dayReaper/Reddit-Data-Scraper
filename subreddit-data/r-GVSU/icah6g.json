What if that happens 2-3 times this semester ? So we have to be at home 4-6 weeks? I would love to have in person classes, but it\u2019s simply not possible. I wish they would \njust go online like MSU just did at this point.\n\nThere will be parties. There will be people going out. Just let me do my classes online and try and get through this year safe and as fast as possible.",

You don\u2019t need all these precautions they put in that they said was the reason for raising tuition.\n\nPersonally, I think no one can win in this situation, but I just want honest answers at this point about what\u2019s going to happen.",

I\u2019m prepared to beg for online courses I\u2019m so terrified.\n\nEdit: not to mention, the decision was made RIGHT after tuition was due, AND the week before move-in. I understand admin is in a tough spot... but they could\u2019ve cancelled dorm life a month ago and went totally online. It\u2019s so frustrating.",

These bastards don't care about our safety, and yet they will still terrorize and denounce anyone who goes against or isn't for their draconian rules. I'm so done with this school because I wanted to just do online during this pandemic so I would be able to save money during this pandemic where I made less money because of reduced hours but grand valley didn't require all of their classes and professors to all have online options. So now here I am having to have gotten a place to stay in allendale when instead if this school cared about their students and giving them choices I could have saved like 4 or 5 thousand dollars from studying and taking classes at home.",

Normally we would learn these skills on standardized patients (SPs) who are paid volunteers for medical students. This obviously can't be done online! I need this training in order to go on into my clinical year so I'm worried my graduation will be pushed back. This whole thing is just a shit show for everyone.",

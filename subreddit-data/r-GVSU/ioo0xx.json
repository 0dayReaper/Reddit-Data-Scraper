    "postText": "Might be a bit of a shot in the dark/not the right thing for this sub but I\u2019ve been having some really odd issues with Blackboard ever since I updated my GV account password. I\u2019m able to log in to Blackboard through my laptop and through Safari on mobile, but when I try to log in through the app, it says the password is wrong? I tried to change the password through Blackboard specifically to see if I could just start over (maybe this needs to be through GV/through myBanner though) and it was telling me the password was wrong even though I checked over and over and over. Does anyone have any idea what\u2019s going on/has this happened to anyone else?",

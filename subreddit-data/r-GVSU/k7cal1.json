For me, I know I work better during the early morning or evening when it's dark, on my desk (simple foldable table) and my desktop lamp. Sometimes, I'll have rain/thunder noises or a \"study with me\" video in the background to keep me focused, nothing with words though. I also find it helpful to work with someone else (We use discord whenever we want to \"study together\"). Even if the person is not physocally there, it makes it easier for me knowing someone else is doing their work.\n\nHope this helps!",

If the weather ever gets better maybe go to a park? This is a pretty tough time right now. Best of luck to you and I hope you finish out the semester strong!",

This comment might be too late with the semester winding down...Maybe talk to a close friend, or relative to see if you can go to their house and set up at their kitchen table. If anything it removes you from your living space and puts you in a different setting...hope this helps.",

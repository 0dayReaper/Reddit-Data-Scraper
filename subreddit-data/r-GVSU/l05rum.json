    "postText": "I realized that I no longer want to take a certain ECO course, but I need a replacement class for it so I still have 15 credits. Unfortunately all the classes I would rather take instead are closed. I've submitted registration overrides for 2 classes that I still need to take and 1 class to fulfill the ECO requirement, in the hopes of taking one of those instead. \n\nMy question is: given that I've submitted a few different override requests to give myself more opportunities, and given the fact that the classes are closed at the moment, how likely am I to get approved for registration overrides?",

I would highly suggest keeping your eyes open tomorrow/ through all of this week. Many students are dropping classes throughout Syllabus week and I find that I am typically able to snag a spot within my preferred class during this time by just periodically checking Banner every day. Best of luck!",

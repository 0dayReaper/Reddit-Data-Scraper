    "postText": "Hey all, just wanted to hop on here in hopes of networking, \n\nA little bit about me:\nI'm 21, an Ad &amp; PR major with an emphasis in PR. And I was actually a transfer student to GV in Jan 2020. I like midnight baking, binging tv shows on all platforms.  So, my first year of university at a new school was cut short, and so was my chance to meet new people. And then especially since the pandemic and coming back on campus this fall 2020. So. With that being said...\n \n\nIm looking for people to connect with! Anyone can DM me really that goes to GV. I need to expand my network professionally, and for personal gain (bc, mostly everyone is still technically in quarantine, and a touch lonely, if not alot of other problems \ud83d\ude2d)\n\n**psa, in case this needs to be clear, BLM, i am a lgbtq+ supporter, and yes I did vote for Biden. Lesser evil out-of the two, and no, I dont agree with really anything the cheeto did*",

Gotten enough crap from faculty, professors, and classmates to wish I could relocate. But apparently asking for advice on that topic is a  loaded question according to the career center.\n\nI'd dm you, but I really just want to put this school behind me. Just wanted to confirm gvsu has a lot of work ahead of itself and making a woman president is nowhere near enough",

Regardless the way you were treated is severely unacceptable. \n \nThis is about networking. DM is always open regardless. A person is more than their town, school, race/ethnicity. Gender identity, And sexual orientation though. Keep that in mind before you lump everyone together. Minorities need to stick together, especially right now but always.\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffe  One of the worst things you can do is generalize someone.",

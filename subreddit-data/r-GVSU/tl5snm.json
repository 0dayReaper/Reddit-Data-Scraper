We had the professor who teaches it come to one of our student org events this semester and he was phenomenal! I think the course is 1 credit so it's pretty easy to slip in.\n\nI've also enjoyed all the economics classes (I'm biased as an econ major though). The department has hired some really great faculty over the past 2 years. I think my top three are\n\n* ECO 355 (Markets, Strategy, and Government Policy)\n* ECO 360 (The Economics of Work and Family)\n* ECO 300 (Data Analytics for Economics and Business)",

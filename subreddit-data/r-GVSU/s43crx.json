Just got my Physics book hard cover for $73 vs. the $82 the Laker Store wanted for a LOOSE LEAF copy of the book.\n\nEdit: All your codes for Webassign, McGrawHill, everything, can also be purchased cheaper directly from the website than the Laker Store.",

One of my finance professor's told us that they were required to add it on the syllabus even if it wasn't necessary. Dropped $150 for a code and didn't use it once.",

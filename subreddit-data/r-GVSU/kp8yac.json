I applied to be in Holton Hooker, and I have heard that the beds can be fully lofted or only partially lofted. I was curious if anybody had any preferences, or if there was any significant difference between the two.",

            "comment": "I personally preferred half lofted beds over fully lofted. I didn\u2019t like having to climb into fully lofted beds and getting out was always a pain (I am short though). From my experience with the dorms sometimes you actually have to get all your stuff in there to figure out what room layout will work best. The first few weeks of school many of my friends rearranged their rooms realizing other layouts made the space better or they didn\u2019t want their bed lofted anymore. I think I have an old photo of a half lofted bed (not in Holton Hooker though) if you want to see it message me.",

I\u2019m not 100% sure how it was all set up since it was about 4 years ago.\n\nMy last year when my room had a closet, I put my dresser in there. Bookshelf was used as a \u2018night stand\u2019 and the desk sat at the foot of my bed. So my bed was on the floor. I liked this way a lot. Especially since I had my service dog with me.\n\nThe beds aren\u2019t hard to loft/unloft especially if you have 2-3 people.",

This allowed us to put our desks with bookshelves stacked next to each other and wardrobes on each side of the door. I guess it all depends on what style of dorm you have, and how close you are with your roommate(s). Choosing something that is mutually beneficial will be super helpful in the long run. Don\u2019t make the dorm about splitting it down the middle. That made a huge difference when my second roommate moved in. We made the space about both of our needs and preferences!!",

I got the dimensions of my place from the landlord (I\u2019m sure you can get them online), and made my own blueprints! I drew out several layouts with all the furniture I planned on having. Remember to think about things like a TV, if that needs to be visible from certain areas. If you need a vanity space for your makeup, or art supplies... whatever it is. Plan your place around what will keep you productive and happy! My thing at my studio was combining my vanity area and my art desk into one space. I also like being able to see the tv from the kitchen area as well as from my bed, so I set it up that way. Try some different ideas for your space on paper. Seeing things and feeling it with your hands makes a huge difference. At least in my book.",

That gave me a fair bit of room, considering what I had to work with. My roommate, meanwhile, had his bed only on the two shelves, with his desk off next to it. Combine that with the bureau that's in there, and it was already a tight space. Then you realize that you would have to crawl under the bed to even use the shelves, depriving you of even more space.\n\nI'm sure if you were in the other styles, you would have more options.

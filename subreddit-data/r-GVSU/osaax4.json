    "postText": "hey! i am moving out of a 4 person townhome at Sutter's Mill this August. The lease is until November and the other roommates are all resigning, so if you stayed you'd have housing the whole school year! or just til nov if needed. \n\nTwo girls, one guy roommate. Two dogs and one cat are living there. Its a beautiful townhouse with a deck overlooking a creek, laundry in unit, a super spacious kitchen, and 4.5 bathrooms, you get your own bathroom in your room!! I can send pics if you DM me :) \n\nRent is 348.75 a month and utilities are usually under 40 a month\n\nThis will also be posted in the fb group soon\n\nThanks!",

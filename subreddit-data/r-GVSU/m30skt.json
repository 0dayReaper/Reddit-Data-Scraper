In addition, you should provide them with the following information about one of your devices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* building/room number\n* device type and operating system\n* IP address (google 'what's my IP address')\n* MAC address (see [here](https://carleton.ca/its/help-centre/how-to-find-your-mac-address/))\n\nIT may ask you to do some basic troubleshooting steps like forgetting/readding the network. Humor them but make it clear that this affects multiple devices and has gotten worse over time.",

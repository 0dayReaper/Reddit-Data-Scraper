My mom actually just called to tell me she read a GVSU post on Facebook stating that \"the campus is not in danger\".\n\nI'm sorry, but how am I supposed to believe that when there was a deceased person found under \"suspicious circumstances\", and no other information has been released since?",

It\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s foul play, and especially if they\u2019ve posted the campus is not in danger, we can likely rule out something threatening. There\u2019ve been way too many rumors floating around this sub about this.",

I agree that we don\u2019t know, but people have blown this way out of proportion on this sub. I\u2019m not saying that it wasn\u2019t terrible, but the conclusions that people are jumping to has lead to some pretty unfounded conclusions. The email came soon after the police report, and the news articles followed soon after. This means the very early information has been spread, when they likely still didn\u2019t know the cause of death.",

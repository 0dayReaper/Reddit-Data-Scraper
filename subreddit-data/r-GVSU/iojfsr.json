The fact that there are people in my living center not putting trash where it belongs (They put it outside of the building's entrance and sometimes even in the halls) makes me feel helpless for GVSU. If people can't be arsed to walk a few more feet to the garbage dumpster what makes GVSU's administration think students can fight against COVID-19's spread?",

    "postText": " \n\nHappy Friday everyone! I work for BISSELL and we are currently hiring associates for our hourly roles. We are looking for set-up trainees and full set-up people to work on the 2nd shift.\n\nBISSELL offers some really cool benefits but the one that stands out, especially for the trainee position, is tuition reimbursement; if you are interested in starting a career in the skilled trades this is a really nice opportunity.\n\nThe requirements for both roles are highschool certificate and mechanical aptitude. Experience troubleshooting equipment, tearing it down and putting it back up.\n\nSalaries start at 19 an hour plus shift premium. If you are interested or know anyone who would benefit from this please share. These are difficult times and we are really a great company to work for, growing stronger and bigger every day.\n\nYou can find the job descriptions on the links below. Also, feel free to comment here and I will get in touch.\n\nEnjoy the weekend!\n\nRoc\u00edo\n\n[Set-up Trainee](https://bit.ly/34meG3N)\n\n[Machine Set-up Person](https://bit.ly/2Gi48dO)",

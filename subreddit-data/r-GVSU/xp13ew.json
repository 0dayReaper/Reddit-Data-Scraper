I really enjoyed the classes, and the Honors Senior Project is truly a free for all. I wrote and edited 5 new chapters of my novel, edited 6 previously written, and walked out of GVSU with the first 1/3 of my first novel done. It was a wonderful experience, and I\u2019d never do it any other way.",

I fully stand by your comments. \n\nI did a semester abroad and double majored, I was able to combine my semester abroad and both majors into my senior project. My advisors in all 3 (both majors and honors) really helped me move it along, and I\u2019m just terrible with making decisions. I did that alongside my 2 majors\u2019 theses, and it was actually a lot of fun. \n\nAs well, mid sophomore year, I experienced a mental break (mental health went to shit, physical health was getting rocky with really severe migraines, and my parents were getting divorced). My honors advisor worked with me to move home and get my room and board for the second half of the year back. They checked in on me regularly, too. My grades slipped due to, well all of that, and instead of telling me that I would get kicked out of honors, they helped me to get into honors academic probation. Basically, I stayed in honors and worked on raising my GPA. As long as it went up, they were able to keep renewing the probation. I ended up graduating with a 3.21, with honors. \n\nThey were great at helping me along personally as well as academically. They also suggested that I see a counselor on campus for my issues, and it really helped. \n\nFrom my experience, they care about their students\u2019 well-being, not just their grades.",

I was able to get into grad school easily and it looks good on a resume. I really don't recommend living in Niemeyer though unless you know that you're outgoing and will be in lots of clubs and orgs because it is so far from the other freshman res halls and it's SO difficult to make friends there which made my freshman year super difficult.",

My sequence was great, I still talk to my professor every now and then a few years after I graduated. \n\nNiemeyer was very nice, although not particularly social.

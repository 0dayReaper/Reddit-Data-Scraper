    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'm planning out my schedule for the fall, and any suggestions would be helpful! \n\nCurrently I have 10 credits planned out (the courses I need to graduate), but I need 2 more to fulfill the full-time student requirement. I found a few classes that sounded interesting, so if anyone has taken any of these classes please let me know what your experience was like! And if you have any other suggestions for 1-credit classes, please let me know and I'll check them out:\n\nGPY 101 - Sustainability and Place\n\nENS 183 - Sustainability as a Lifestyle\n\nFIT 109 - Yoga\n\nFIT 119 - Outdoor Skills\n\nFIT 150 - Swimming Strokes/ Drills\n\n(PS. Does anyone still know if the walking class is a thing? I had a friend in the class a few years ago, and it seems like it would be pretty easy to get the required steps just by my daily commute around campus).",

So I'm pretty sure it's still a thing. Also, there's a beer brewing class that might be worthwhile. I think it's worth more than one credit. But it still looks interesting.",

You learn some interesting stuff if you\u2019re into sustainability and the weekly homework was just a ~250 word response and sometimes an article to read. Might be different in-person tho, I took it online. Yumi is such a sweet person!\n\nP.S. the fitness walking class is either called FIT 114 or FIT 180, i think they changed it recently",

I mainly got my steps by disc golfing\n\nEdit I totally forgot I took us102 and us301 my last semester. \n\nUs102 is useless if you picked a major but its the easiest class I ever took lmao. \n\nUs301 is wildly important in my opinion and everyone should take it. Even though I picked my field of work prior I took it just to be sure, but left the class with a god tier resume and immense interview/negotiation skills that everyone needs. I took a $9 raise that semester due to us301 before even graduating \n\nThey are career exploration classes",

Whole grade was tied to the project but for different assignments like a diary/journal on your research which is very easy to do \n\nWe had to pick a current project going on in the world regarding clean or green energy. I picked a nuclear plant and the prof thought it was so cool. 100%ed the class. Oh we had to make a poster btw, not even a PowerPoint thing. Hardest part was formatting it to look pretty\n\nAnd it was very short. I dont remember how many weeks but it was over super fast\n\nOh and there's two books they say to buy but you only need one of them. Didn't realize it but I wasted money buying both. Can't remember which one is the more required one \n\nAlso is your username based on the Radiohead song?",

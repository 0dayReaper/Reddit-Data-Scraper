    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo something a little different and not COVID related, but has anyone noticed the GVSU parking enforcer truck driving around a lot lately? I see them every time I am out, doing their rounds around the campus. I have also noticed a lot of tickets on peoples windshields. Has anyone noticed this as well or am I just paying too close of attention to it?",

With that being said, we also have more students walking around that are capable of giving tickets this year- with the help of some sort of electronic device that can look up your license plate to see if you have a pass- it will also take a picture of your car in the spot and print the ticket right there.  \n\nI believe that there has been a legitimate increase because they have a much simpler way of writing and verifying tickets now.\n\nI",

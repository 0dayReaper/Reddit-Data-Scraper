They\u2019re pretty quiet, rooms are nice and shared kitchen &amp; bathroom are great! Personally I never had too many issues with the communal laundry room(s). It was rare for me to have to wait for a machine, and almost all the machines ran fine. A bonus was my unit was very close to the parking lot so it was easy to come and go",

I enjoyed it bc I was able to meet international students and I\u2019m still friends with them. \n\nNo dishwasher, but living room was spacious enough. I cant complain tbh. \n\nBiggest perk was that it was nice to be able to walk to class in 10-15 minutes.",

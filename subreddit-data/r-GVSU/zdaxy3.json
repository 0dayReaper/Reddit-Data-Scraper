    "postText": "I recently got a good paying job in North GR and have to have a car to go there in person everyday. I only need a place to park for a few weeks till I can afford a parking pass next semester here at GV. Is there any place along route 45 (Laker Line) where I can park my car everyday and take the Laker Line back to Allendale? I don't want to pay for a pass right now with a week and a half left as that would be a total waste of money.",

I believe the 12 also goes there on the South side of the building, if it\u2019s useful to get to the West Side.\n\nThere\u2019s also a big lot behind the fire station in Standale that you can use as well.",

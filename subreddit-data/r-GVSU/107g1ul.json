    "postText": "Hi all, hope you're having a great start to the new semester! I've found myself in a bit of a time conflict: I have an online pilates class from 9:00 to 9:50, but an in-person class in Niemeyer right at 10:00. While I love using the Rec, I'm afraid getting out and taking the bus from there won't give me enough time to make it across campus. Is there some sort of empty room I could use/reserve near the Honors College/Connection/Kirk to bring my mat into and do my online class? \n\nThanks for any info, and I'll try to ask around Honors today to see if they have any leads!",

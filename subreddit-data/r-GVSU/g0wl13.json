            "comment": "Hey! I lived there for 2 years in the 2 bed 4 person. Location was nice, but quite a walk to mackinac compared to freshman land. Laundry is done at either the north or south \u201ccenter\u201d which is also where you\u2019ll get your mail. If you\u2019re an incoming freshman, really the only downside of it is you\u2019re less \u201cforced\u201d to be social with the people around you because you essentially live in your own apartment. As far as being cramped, the bedrooms are pretty tight, but there\u2019s social areas because it\u2019s like a normal apartment so it\u2019s not bad. Pretty much like traditional college dorms",

There's not dishwasher though, so you need to make sure your roommates do their stuff, and since mine didn't it could easily get gross. I'm not sure, but you may want to check if the option you are looking at has 1 or 2 bathrooms, as I imagine sharing a bathroom with 4 people could be really irritating. I believe that the housing sitaton is each of you have a \"bunk bed\" sor of style, where you each have your own bed with a desk underneath and drawers for you to work at, you also get your own closet (and the closets are actually pretty large though so you can also put some stuff there if you wish). As for the living room area, it's fairly spacious, and you could easil set up a TV with your roommates if you wish. I hope this helps!",

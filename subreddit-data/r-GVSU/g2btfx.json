We're currently comprised of a trumpet, trombone, guitar, bass, 2 percussionists and a singer and we're looking for a **Saxophone,** **Clarinet** and **Flute** to round out our sound.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're looking for a fun group of dedicated musicians and willing to commit to playing with us **2 times a week** (when the quarantine lifts, naturally), please shoot me a text at **(631)** **994-9327**",

( I had Matthew Mapes who I liked a lot.)\n\nI also enjoyed CBR 281 Audio Production I-II because the professor, Joseph McCargar is great. This one is fun if you enjoy creating or editing music or working on audio design.\n\nAside from ones that are fun, I would recommend taking any extra writing, photo or graphic design classes if you plan on being on the creative side of things after you graduate.",

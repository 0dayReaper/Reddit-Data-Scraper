I got away with it being late and not letting them into mine because they couldn't get a warrant, thank God. They did search the fridge and take the half gal I had tho \n\nJust don't smoke weed in your dorm. Or make your neighbors stop if they do it (why I got searched)",

Like a 20 year old fellow student is going to be doing the investigation on a Reddit post to figure out that someone is drinking. Clutches pearls!\n\nRAs really do not care that you have alcohol in your fridge.  No one really cares unless you give them a reason to care. Aka being belligerent at 2am.  They are students and have a job to do.  That is making sure shit doesn't go off the rails on their floor.\n\nYou are extremely unlikely to have your fridge checked though they do have the authority to do so. I've never seen or heard of anyone having their fridge checked.",

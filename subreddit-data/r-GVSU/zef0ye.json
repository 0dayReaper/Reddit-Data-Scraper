    "postText": "I've been looking at classes varying from Art 101, Aesthetics, to Photography and Music. I have no idea which one to take on top of my already busy schedule. By no means am I lazy, or not a hard worker, but I would like an easy \"A\" as I'm trying to only fill a gen ed. I have no experience with music, or photography, or art in general. Any help is greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "If you don't mind the occasional essay, aesthetics is a breeze, and you don't have to draw or anything.  I enjoyed the class, the workload was beyond reasonable, and I found it to be interesting enough compared to other art options.",

            "comment": "I took the philosophy class Aesthetics for my philosophy minor: there was actually quite a bit of writing. The professor who was there now works with a different university, however he was really knowledgeable and his passion really came through in the way he lectured. \nIt\u2019s a great class but does require reading and writing, so if that\u2019s not your jam I\u2019d look elsewhere. \n\nPhoto 1 was (when I took it) black and white 35mm film photography. You are required to buy your camera, film, and processing items (paper, etc.) and will have to spend considerable amounts of time in the dark room developing your film. If you like to learn new techniques in the dark, then go for it!\n\nI was a music education major so I\u2019m pretty well versed in the topic, however, the content provided in each class can vary greatly based on who is teaching it and I found some professors to be more personable and professional than others.",

If you do venture into photography there are digital cameras on campus available to rent as long as you are signed up for the service and as long as you follow the rules regarding the equipment.",

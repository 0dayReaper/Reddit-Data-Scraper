It can be competitive to get into since a lot of people are interested in it but there's a limited number of people who can take it due to the amount of brewing equipment available. I found the course super fun and interesting but also extremely easy. I learned about the history, science, and health effects of beer, tasted various styles of beer, and even brewed two batches of beer with group mates that we could take home with us as long as we were 21+. The only graded work we had to do were a couple of easy quizzes, giving a presentation on the last beer our group brewed, turning in a journal at the end of the semester where we took notes on the beer we tasted and brewed, and the course final exam which consisted of tasting a beer, identifying what style it was, and also doing a group evaluation. The professor is also a super chill guy.",

    "postText": "Hello, GVSU reddit! I am a current Freshman at MSU doing my bachelors in Information Science and so far the program has been underwhelming. None of my classes I have lined up seem to delve really deeply into the actual IT, programming, networking, Etc... We seem to do more broad strokes such as managing products and they seem to loop in a lot of general media stuff. Like one of my classes is called \"Understanding Media and Information\" and we basically don't talk about actual computer stuff that I want to learn about.\n\nSo, I was wondering if anyone here knows about the Information Technology or Information Systems undergraduate programs at GVSU? Is the work practical? Does it give good hands on training that will give me actual good experience for when I'm looking for an actual job?\n\nI currently live in northern Grand Rapids, 25 minutes away from GVSU.",

            "comment": "CIS - Computing and Information Systems Faculty Here.  We have two programs that you have identified interest in Information Technology and Information Systems.  Although there is some overlap between the two in terms of courses, the IS major has more business courses as part of the major while the IT major focuses more on technical courses throughout.  Both will also allow you to focus on specific areas that you might want to pursue such as data management and visualization, networking, and software development.  \n\nMany of our courses within the major feature a lab component to reinforce lecture material.  This starts out with the initial programming courses CIS 160 (a 3 credit course with a working lab in non-pandemic times) and CIS 162 (a 4 credit course with a 2 hour lab working on weekly coding activities).  As you move through courses they will have practical projects and both majors have an external internship and capstone where you will work on industry sponsored projects.\n\nFeel free to reach out to me (my email can be found on the [cis.gvsu.edu](https://cis.gvsu.edu) website).  I'm primarily a CS professor in terms of courses I teach, but would be happy to assist in getting any questions you have answered.  Another resource is to open up a discussion with our PCEC advising staff who can help you figure out what courses would transfer: [https://www.gvsu.edu/pcec/advising/ ](https://www.gvsu.edu/pcec/advising/)\n\nInformation on the majors (primarily the courses you'd take) are at:\n\nInformation Systems - [https://www.cis.gvsu.edu/information-systems-major/](https://www.cis.gvsu.edu/information-systems-major/)\n\nInformation Technology - [https://www.cis.gvsu.edu/information-technology-major/](https://www.cis.gvsu.edu/information-technology-major/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps!",

I also got my masters in Computer Information Systems from GVSU in 2015 and I currently work in GVSU's IT department. I think the program is great, but it sounds to me like you are leaning more towards a Computer Science degree than Information Systems.\n\nIn my mind, the difference is that Information Systems focuses more on how information technology can be applied in the business world. So there's an equal focus on learning the technology and also learning how to manage projects and how the technology is used in a business. You will not get deep down into the very technical workings of the technology.\n\nComputer science, on the other hand, really focuses on the technical piece and the science piece of technology.\n\nI would really think about what you want to do in your career and find the program that fits that. If you want to be a really good programmer or work in networking or any of the other more technical fields in information technology, you are probably going to want to go with Computer Science. On the other hand, if you are more interested in how technology can improve business processes, Information Systems is a better fit.\n\nEither way, in my opinion, GVSU has great programs. In both Computer Science and Information Systems, a lot of the work is hands-on and practical. You will get a lot of experience actually working with the technology instead of just sitting in a lecture. Of course, not all classes are going to be like that, but more often than not, you are going to get real world problems to solve and good experience that will help you in the real world.",

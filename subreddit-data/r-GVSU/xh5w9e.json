Saved me $400.\n\nThis is just my experience, it is totally definitely not advice \ud83d\ude09 \n\nThat being said the bus system is pretty banging. Use it if you can.",

Whenever cross walks are done everyone disperses and goes to whatever lot they want to. So someone could check a lot and leave and 20min later a different person could there checking it again. Only way to avoid it is to park where you're supposed too lol.",

I had a 6-10 shift so instead of biking from south campus, I would just park (out of the way mind you), and never was ticketed.\n\nEspecially true by parking the front of my car where the only way to get to my barcode on the permit was to climb over a snowbank. Nobody was going to do that.",

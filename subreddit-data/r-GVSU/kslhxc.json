Yeah it sucks, but welcome to life AFTER school. You work 40 hours a week, every week until you retire. Some places you get vacation days, but it is never anywhere near the time you get off school. \n\nNot let me sympathize, I think you honestly need help from the sounds of your other comments. You should seek professional mental health guidance if you can\u2019t, to help manage your time better and to help deal with stress from school. I\u2019m not saying school isn\u2019t stressful, but this is the one point in your life you are still allocated breaks that are extremely long compared to the working world.  I\u2019ve had a bit of therapy myself and you can learn coping skills to help through times you feel overwhelmed.\n\nI hope you\u2019re able to find the help you need.",

Work and college are two entirely different situations. Yeah, the long winter break is awesome, I won't deny that, but ten weeks from now stress levels are going to be as high as they were last semester.\n\nAnd while I appreciate the advice, I have been in therapy for many years in the past. I don't need help. I am able to manage myself just fine, I am worried about other people such as individuals on campus and even people at other campuses. I mean, just look at r/Collegerant",

            "comment": "Campus view is the best bargain, in my opinion, I think I paid $420/month there. With that being said, I also lived at Meadows Crossing with $500/month rent, and the difference in quality is pretty large - The Meadows staff are MUCH friendlier, apartments/townhomes are newer so there arent as many maintenance issues, and each bedroom has its own bathroom, which is really really nice. Also much larger kitchen. I could go on, but you get the point. Would not recommend campus view solely based on the fact that their staff are rude.",

Not bad but not great. It does have a free bus that runs around the apartment complex which is very handy but it fills up quick at peak times.",

It's also a longer walk to classes but the area is more private and quiet.",

It\u2019s more pricey than some of the other on and off campus, but being able to wake up 15 minutes before class starts and still make it on time was pretty nice. Also, never had any noise issues. In fact, the only party I was ever aware happened was one my roommates threw. Dealing with RA\u2019s and university guidelines can get annoying sometimes tho. Looking back on this year, I would absolutely do it again even if I knew that housing would kick us out with less than a weeks notice. 8/10\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the name tho, most international students lived in laker village bc it\u2019s cheaper",

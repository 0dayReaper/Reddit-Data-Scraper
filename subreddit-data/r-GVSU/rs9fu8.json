Like others have said, MSU also has a booster requirement. \n\n\nJust from how things have worked in the past, I would imagine we would get a booster requirement and *potentially* even go online for the first several weeks.",

Based on the data, GVSU is still doing much better than the surrounding counties with respect to new cases reported. If you base your decisions on data, like you should, then there's no really compelling reason based on those data to mandate boosters, or do the first two weeks of Winter 2022 online like some places are doing, etc. \n\n**BUT:** (1) the dashboard hasn't been updated since December 17, and Omicron has really taken off since then and (2) all this could change after the holidays.",

So while I agree with your sentiment, I don\u2019t think we can say if anything should happen either way. The last data we had was pre-omicron. \n\nInteresting to see what happens Monday.",

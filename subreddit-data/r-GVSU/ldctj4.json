    "postText": "Hey Guys, I\u2019m planning on transferring over to GV for my sophomore year in Fall 2021. Right now I have the thought of staying in the dorms for the first year to build those close social connections, especially for meeting people to room with in an apartment Junior year. Basically, I\u2019m wondering, does this sound like a sound plan? Do many sophomores still live in the dorms? Or would living in an apartment on campus be a better choice or even something else? Thanks!",

I think it would be a good idea to stay on-campus, whether it\u2019s the apartments or the dorms. I got involved in a club, so I made friends outside of the apartment. Just make sure to get involved!

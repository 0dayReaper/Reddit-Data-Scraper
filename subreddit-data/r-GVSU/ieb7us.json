            "comment": "Sophomore now at GV. I wish you the best of luck. It really depends on the classes you take. I had very manageable classes. I had one professor who literally emailed us daily just to stay updated and connected after we went online last spring, and I had one who I literally did not hear from a single time until after the final exam (which he never even told us anything about). I had a friend who locked himself in his room and did homework and class work for 8+ hours a day (engineering major). Good luck.",

            "comment": "I had a few of my majors courses (allied health sciences) at GV offered as hybrid classes (which met 3 times during the semester). My experience with all of the courses was the content was relatively easy and I did well in the courses (got A\u2019s) however I feel as though I didn\u2019t truly learn the material due to the online format. It was easy for me to skate by and pass the quizzes/exams without really studying much. I\u2019m currently in grad school and those courses weren\u2019t necessary for my future profession so it worked out in the end. But if I could go back and have a do-over I would have spent more time genuinely studying for those courses and watching the lectures to learn the content.",

            "comment": "I think most of it comes down to the prof. Some profs do a great job of running the class online or hybrid and others are terrible. In addition to that some classes are less affected by going online. If you\u2019re not going to take a gap year, look at gen eds that don\u2019t have labs if you\u2019re going with online classes, as they most likely won\u2019t be as difficult. \n\nI finished my MBA this summer and having my last 4 classes and capstone project all online was so-so since they were originally hybrid. I had one prof that was awesome in person and mediocre online and one prof that was terrible in person and excellent online.",

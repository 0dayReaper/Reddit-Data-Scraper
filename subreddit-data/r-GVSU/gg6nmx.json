    "postText": "Hey,\n\nI (when I say I, I mean my dad, because I had a flue earlier this week) went to grab the rest of my stuff out of my GV apartment and a lot was missing, including an 80 dollar coffee maker and about 120 dollars worth of personal books. I know this was my roommate who did it, as he stayed there alone for two months and has a history of getting in trouble for stealing roommate's items. I contacted the living center director and she said something to the effect of \"that sucks, contact the police I guess.\" Obviously the police aren't going to do anything about this, is there any other recourse I can take? Given the extraordinary circumstances it seems shitty of GVSU to just leave me out in the cold after 200 dollars of my stuff was taken after i left it there after being kicked out on 4 days notice during a pandemic.  \n\n\nIdk if there's anything I can actually do, I'm mostly just pissed and venting",

File a police report for theft, GVSU will probably provide a name, address and phone number to the police if they ask. Otherwise, you can take your roommate to small claims for the cost of the stuff.",

GV recently spent 7 million dollars on upgrading cameras to cover every single entryway into campus buildings. Additionally they have a dedicated detective that focuses only on investigations/follow ups. Contacting them for a follow up is one way GVPD prioritizes the focus of investigations.",

If you go to gvsu.edu/registrar, you\u2019ll choose the Students drop down menu, go to Student Forms, and download the Registration Drop/Add form. You will need the signature of your professor and the department chair, a statement of support from your professor OR the department chair, and a personal statement on why you need to withdraw. You would send all those documents to the Student Academic Success Center at sasc@gvsu.edu, and then they would determine if you can withdraw. If they accept your appeal, it would be sent to the Registrar\u2019s Office to withdraw you from the course.",

Sorry for replying eons after you\u2019ve commented here, but since you seem well versed in this process: do you happen to know if there is a deadline by which the late withdrawal form (with the requisite signatures, statement, etc.) must be submitted? I saw on one college\u2019s (PCEC\u2019s) page that it was 5pm on the last day of regular instruction (with nothing accepted once finals week begins). But I\u2019ve not seen this elsewhere on GVSU\u2019s website. My stepdaughter is trying to pull this off after having been advised by her professor recently that she will fail a class, and that a late withdrawal due to extenuating circumstances is her only hope. But she hasn\u2019t completed much less submitted the form yet.",

Explanation of appeal\n2. Registration and Drop/Add Form signed by their professor and department chair\n3. At least one statement of support from the professor or department chair\nUndergraduate students should continue attending class until notification of a final decision about their appeal is received.\n \nPlease send your completed Registration and Drop/Add Form, along with your letter of appeal and letter of support to the Student Academic Success Center.\n\nUnfortunately, I am unclear if this means while classes are still in session, or if your student would be able to work this out during final exam week. I would recommend that your student TRY, and SASC will then be the determining factor. \n\nIf there were extenuating circumstances, your student could also try an ARC or TRAC appeal\u2014look on the Registrar\u2019s website for more information on those!",

Unfortunately, however, we have a bit of a procrastinator on our hands, which is how we got into this mess in the first place. We will also look into the ARC and TRAC appeals. Again, thanks so much for your response!",

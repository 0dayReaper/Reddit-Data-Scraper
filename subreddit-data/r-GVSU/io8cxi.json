The note had to be in this format: \u201cPatient has XYZ diagnosis or symptoms, I believe that having a emotional support animal will help alleviate the symptoms by XYZ (getting them out of bed, giving them routine). \n\nI can try and find my note so that you can see the format. Also remember your ESA can only be in your house &amp; is not able to go to classes, games, etc \ud83d\ude42",

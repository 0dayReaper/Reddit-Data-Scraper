That also nicely avoids trying to get to the B wing basement and ending up in Manitou instead.\nThe real hard mode is Calder. Half of the hallways are dead ends instead of connecting to each other.",

So if possible, dont ever do any MAK classes, but language and a few other courses are unfortunately in MAK I just got lucky w online classes :)",

Not all the buildings are open, but the majority are open and staffed. \n\nOR\n\nYou can take a [Virtual Tour](https://grandvalleystate.university-tour.com/map.php).",

I chose gv over state because state is fucking massive and intimidating\n\nYou can get used to the paths at gv within a week but some buildings are sooo confusing like mak. All the lake halls are super simple though\n\nYou gotta remember you can walk from one end of campus to the other in 15 min if you follow any path and just follow it\n\nDon't over intimidate yourself!\n\nI would go and play some pokemon go or ride a bike or longboard around for like half an hour and you'll get the hang of it. Prob can't go into buildings though",

I even took a couple different routes to see which one I liked best. I did this in the week before classes started after I moved in, so most of the buildings were closed. Some weren't, though, so I was able to go in and wander around and find my classes.",

    "postText": "Hi, all. I commute to the Allendale campus for two of my classes, but currently one of the classes has switched to remote learning via Zoom while the other one is still person. The in-person class is right after the remote class, which means I have to drive to campus to take the remote class or else I won't make it to the in-person class in time. What would be the best place on campus to find a reasonably comfortable, quiet space in which to do the Zoom class, keeping in mind that class discussion is still required so it would have to be somewhere where I could still talk and not disrupt people around me?",

            "comment": "One option would be reserving a room in the library for each zoom. You can reserve up to 10 days in advance so you can be sure to get a room when you need it. Might still have to hustle to your next class, but at least you won\u2019t have to worry about disturbing anyone.",

I\u2019d imagine that nobody would care if you threw some headphones in and sat in on class. Nobody will bat an eye if you occasionally have to talk because its the first floor.",

I also know that for Lake Superior Hall at least, there's a conference room for School of Com students, and that's usually got one or two people in it max. I would recommend the conference rooms over the library though, because those are a little more secluded.",

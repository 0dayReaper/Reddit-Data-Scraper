I teach MTH 124 fairly often myself and end up studying (and stealing) a lot of what she does in the classroom. Sign up for the class with confidence.",

I ended up dropping the class for different reasons, but her teaching was not one of them.\nIf it matters to you, consider that the summer classes are possibly going to start out online and that can potentially hurt students if they\u2019re not used to that kind of class setting. \nGood luck!",

In the beginning, it was difficult for me because I was taking other heavy classes (I was failing with a 58 the first couple of months) but I dropped a class and my grades got better. I ended pulling through and passed with an 86! The only con I would say are the writing assignments which are a bit annoying to complete (there were seven) as other classes had maybe 3 or 4. But, otherwise, utilize her office hours when you know you are going to struggle with a topic and know that this class takes a lot of time. You will be fine!",

In the email last week they said the self assessment was required and not completing one every day \"would be considered a violation of university policy.\"\n\nHowever, when they talk about the self assessment on their [website](https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/testing-and-contact-tracing-28.htm), they say that it's only required for people coming to campus for class or work. \n\nWhich is it GV?",

Also, how many of us are, against our wishes, are pretty much never going to be on campus and only doing classes online? I for one will be at Pew campus for an hour and a half a week. I can't imagine the frustration students are feeling about this that are fully online.  Don't get me started on the fact that if I want a parking pass for that hour and a half a week, they won't pro rate it and instead will still charge me based on my credit hours (15). I could barely stand the high prices when I parked on campus for class everyday, now this? Disappointed with GVSU this semester. Just as money hungry during a pandemic.",

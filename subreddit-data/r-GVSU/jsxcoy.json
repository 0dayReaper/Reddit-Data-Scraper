    "postText": "My girlfriend and I keep trying to find a place to get tested, but everywhere we call says they won\u2019t help anyone that\u2019s been exposed. When I call spectrum health they send me to the GV health center. When I call the GV health center they send me to Spectrum. What is this dogshit? Why is it so hard for someone worried about having covid to get a test? No wonder our cases are awful. The stupid Novid app doesn\u2019t do anything and now people are getting worried and denied testing. Really great procedure as usual GVSU. Not sure why I expect anything else from this school anymore.",

If there are no appointments available, I recommend checking in the mornings. I had no issue scheduling a test here.",

They then tried directing me back to the GV health center. I spent 34 minutes on the phone and not a single person mentioned this place. They all just said sorry we don\u2019t help those that have been exposed and passed me back and fourth between GV virus action team and Spectrum services.",

While I was able to easily find a site and get tested through MDHSS for no-cost, at seven days out my results still have not been processed. \n\nThe west side of the state is getting hit pretty hard, I hope your able to get tested.

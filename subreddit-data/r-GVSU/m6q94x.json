    "postText": "Hey y'all I'm currently in my senior year (as in I only have one sem left \ud83d\ude2d) and I have NOT been able to find an internship. I've used handshake, linked in, general googling, choosing specific companies, and even indeed.com (sites like monster and Glassboro etc have pm the same info as indeed.com just to say) and I haven't gotten anything but rejection letters. I've tailored my resume several times, even met with career advisors, and I just keep getting the rejection letters. Even my class advisor is searching for me. \n\nMy major is Ad&amp; PR, PR Emphasis, and the options I've been viewing are: PR, communications, social media, event planning, marketing, social media, communications coordinator and here and there ill dip into the AD side. \n\nIf anyone has any help, knowledge, or knows of any opportunities please let me know. At this point I'm not toooooo picky, but obviously would still like something decent. But I do NOT plan to put my graduation on hold simply for a internship.",

I graduated last spring and have been searching for a job the entire last year. \n\nThat said, if you haven't already, definitely talk to Robin Spring and Adrienne Wallace. They both have a lot of connections and try their best to get their students into good jobs and internships.",

Idk but I can't reccomend enough\n\nMy major is psych so when I went to one it felt really weird but I actually found like 4 places that matched with what I was studying. I think I got my current job/internship/practicum from the fair I attended\n\nWith your major there should be a lot of stuff to look at.\n\nI'd say fairs are better than online sites too for this",

While it might not be ideal, you might be able to hold an internship that isn\u2019t directly in the Ad/PR field as long as there can be some sort of connection and it\u2019s something you could genuinely see yourself doing. It also doesn\u2019t need to have the title \u201cinternship\u201d in it for you to make it one. I know this isn\u2019t an option for everyone, but I\u2019m going to the president of a rather larger/impactful organization on campus next year and I\u2019m making that my internship.",

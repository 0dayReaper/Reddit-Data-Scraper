    "postText": "Hello, I am wondering about good on campus jobs where you are able to do lots of homework while on the job. I imagine this is possible for any help desk job, or maybe call center job, unless there are other tasks you are supposed to be doing? Or what about the printer checker jobs? Can you do lots of homework during downtime? Someone who has done a job where they were able to do homework, please let me know! Thank you",

Your main responsibilities are to set up meeting / events that happen in / around kirkof but more often than not you have hour spans of not much going on and you just sit in a cubicle in the office of student life. It has its moments where you may get busy setting up very basic AV equipment, but other than you have quite a bit of down time. The only thing tho is that we are also responsible for setting up other events. For example, we have to do security for the upcoming yung gravy concert. So I won\u2019t be able to be in the audience however I do have a chance to meet gravy",

At Steelcase, you can take notes or read textbooks or whatever as long as you \"look approachable.\" Source: currently working there",

    "postText": "Hi guys, my girlfriend got tested a little over 48 hours ago, and is awaiting results. She needs them asap as she\u2019s got work and she rides horses for the school. I saw some horror stories on here a little while ago about week + waits for results. I was wondering if anyone had been tested recently and what their wait ended up looking like.\nThank you!",

We live in Grand Rapids and I don\u2019t want to drive back but right after I drop her off I have an online class. I also don\u2019t want a ticket so I want to stay in my car close to WiFi so if parking people come around they\u2019ll see me or I can just move and come back. You all understand help me out.",

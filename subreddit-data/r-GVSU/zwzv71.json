Also keep in mind that a gym environment is actually non-judgmental because everyone is focused on bettering themselves and almost anyone is willing to help out.",

When you go through the main entrance to your left is where you find lifting machines (front = legs, middle = arms, back = cables). If you go downstairs there are free weights, yoga mats, etc. \n3. When you go downstairs there is a hallway where you find squat racks, bench presses, and a wide range of dumbbells'.\n\nI hope this helps and good luck!!",

That said, you might try different times of the day and days of the week at first, to find some time slots where it's less populated. That way you can get in, try out different equipment, and get comfortable with the place without so many people around. I've found Sunday afternoons are pretty wide open. \n\nAlso consider group exercise classes, although that sounds like the opposite of what you want being in a group really helps.",

I would see them occasionally around and they seemed pretty good at catering the exercises to whatever level the person was at, including beginner and just introducing them to the equipment.",

In addition to the fitness classes at the Rec being fun and only $5 for an unlimited monthly pass, I'm also taking FIT 105: Pilates to force myself to be more consistent! There's still time to add/drop courses if you're interested, so check out what's open if that might work for your schedule.",

Basically they take your measurements (in private), ask you your heath goals, then inquire about how much time you\u2019d like to spend at the gym per time/week. Then they create a plan based on all that. \n\nWhen my friend went he had very specific goals about being able to run with a certain pace and lift a certain amount. I was more vague and told them I wanted to be closer to \u201chealthy\u201d for someone my age/gender. \n\nAfter they made my plan they showed me how to use, adjust, and clean each piece of equipment. It was a so nice- and FREE.\n\nHere\u2019s the link: \n\nhttps://www.gvsu.edu/rec/fitness/ufit-plan-7.htm#:~:text=About%20UFit&amp;text=The%20Fitness%20and%20Wellness%20Services,the%20participant%20has%20access%20to.",

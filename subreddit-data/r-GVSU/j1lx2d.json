My one \u201cissue\u201d with the second test is that it appeared as though it was completely run by GV students and I didn\u2019t notice anyone with a Spectrum ID. I did the test in the Fieldhouse Balcony, not the West B-ball court.",

If everyone who is healthy in a population contracts a virus and overcomes it, everyone has the antibodies for it. Of course older people and those who are immunocompromised should be kept protected from the virus at all costs. 60% of all COVID deaths have been in nursing homes. I know someone who\u2019s 90 year old grandpa died in his nursing home from the virus. If we protect those people who are at greater risk, what\u2019s wrong with us healthy people getting it?",

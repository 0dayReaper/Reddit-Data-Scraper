            "comment": "I'm in my last year of the program. I feel like I have gotten a lot out of the program and have enjoyed most of the classes aside from the PSM/communications classes, but I guess those are a necessary evil in STEM majors for the best. Professors have been good to great for all of them, I've had (for the non-PSM classes) Scripps, Leidig, Dykes who were all great and Carrier who was new to GV and got better as the semester went on. Of course with covid things have changed but I feel like the transition to online was pretty good this spring. \n\nIt's definitely a program where you get what you put in, however, and I would make a point to really polish your final projects and make a portfolio out of them. If you have any more questions feel free to DM me.",

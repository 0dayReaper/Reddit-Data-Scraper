From what I understand its a relatively new program so I wasn't sure how good it is compared to other similar programs at Davenport or other schools in the area. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSidenote: Is it possible to double major in computer science and cybersecurity?",

Recommend reaching out to Padnos College of Engineering &amp; Computing Advising to discuss options to double major. The advisors are super helpful.

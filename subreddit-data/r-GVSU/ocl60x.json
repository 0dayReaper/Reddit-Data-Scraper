    "postText": "Hello! I am looking for a sublease for a townhome in campus view!\n\nIt is a fully furnished, four bedroom two bathroom style b townhome\n\nThe Rent is $515 a month and about $30 utilities. Oh how subleasing in campus he works, is it is all done through their office. You will not be paying me directly. It is more like a transfer of my lease to you than a \u201csublease\u201d.\n\nIf you are interested, comment here, message me on Facebook, Instagram DM me or Snapchat me! \n\nSnap: lizzie.Kalafut \nInsta: lizzie.Kalafut \n\nIf you are interested and want to know who you will live with I will also get you in contact with the other roommates. :) (They are all very very nice, and I was planning to live there... Unfortunately my personal living situation for next year though has changed)",

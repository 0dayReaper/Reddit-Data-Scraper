    "postText": "I am growing increasingly tired of GVSU Parking enforcement and their predatory fining of students during such a difficult time where every single penny matters.\n\nGVSU has not allowed for an expanded slotting of online classes, forcing students to live on campus and attend in-person classes. Last semester they actually had to suspend the purchasing of parking permits due to being sold out completely. Parking is a nightmare currently for those of us who have cars here. This is the perfect business model for GV, create a problem of selling too many parking passes to the point where there is barely any parking available, only to then prey on students that may be in a rush or cannot find parking.\n\nParking Enforcement can't even follow their own rules! They carelessly park anywhere they want, and just now on my way back from class I saw their truck with the driver side headlight out! Something needs to be done about this, either limiting parking permits to fewer students on a FCFS basis, or by reducing fines during this pandemic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; GV has sold too many parking passes due to their greed, creating a parking nightmare on campus. In turn leading to a difficult time finding parking so students park wherever possible just to turn around and be fined by Parking Enforcement.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o56uptnscoc81.jpg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e4dc8a3979a25a325a15ebf59823262a38d16f22",

I wound up going to the security/parking building to fight it right after since I had proof of money on the meter",

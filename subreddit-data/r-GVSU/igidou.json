    "postText": "TL;DR: Prof said in a normal setting he doesn't require students to use textbooks, all in person powerpoints etc.  Refuses to make videos: too boring. Forcing us to buy a $281 (new), $151 (used), $60 (Rent) book.  \n\nHe stated in his introductory email that when he \"teaches this course in a normal setting, I do not require my students to use a textbook.\" He said that he usually has lecture slides and him speaking teaches the material without lectures.  Cool, I like classes like that, best way to learn.  He went on to talk about how it was difficult to make, don't like recording, \"not pretty on camera,\" and that they're boring.   \nSo rather than have him MAKE something that's FREE, he forces us to buy a textbook, something he said he hasn't done in his many years of teaching at GVSU.  I think it's bullshit, and it's just another lazy prof that's been there too long.  I only checked Amazon for the prices quick at the top, not gonna buy new of course, probably will bootleg it like everyone else if I really need it. \n\nAnyway, I want to cut the guy some slack, but it just pisses me off, profs like this need to be canned.  I hope I'm wrong, but I'll probably never know since I'll probably never actually talk to him.",

This professor sounds a little lazy so their class structure will most likely allow for you to Google search for information that came \"from the textbook\". Source: experience.",

There is a student organized protest coming up on Friday, August 7th at 1 p.m. to protest the 3% tuition increase. If you are interested in attending, I'll drop the Facebook link at the end of this post! While I'm not the creator of the event, I feel like it is necessary for us to use our voice and have more students be aware of this.\n\n[Protest Against GVSU's Tuition Hike]\n(https://facebook.com/events/s/protest-against-gvsus-tuition-/354188118903975/?ti=as)",

Loans aren't the devil. Some loan *practices* are but debt isn't something to be \"avoided at all costs\".\n\nIf you are serious about college, and are using it to build a career, it will pay for itself very quick. If you dick around and get an \"easy major\"  without any career plan, it won't and those people get very upset. However, GVSU had an excellent career center that almost no one I knew actually used, but managed to get me an internship that kickstarted my career AND gave me the guidance I needed to plan out my major path. I actually \"wasted\" 2 years of my college career on a major I didn't end up enjoying, and the career center helped me figure out the optimal way to transition. It was amazing, and more students should use it!\n\nMaybe that's changed, but I serious doubt it.\n\nI also remember GVSU being significantly cheaper than most other colleges. My partner went to a college in Chicago and paid 4x what I paid at GVSU. Again, this may have changed, but a 3% increase seems low to me.\n\nOne huge huge huge life lesson I've taken to heart here that might apply to some: pick your battles carefully.",

I believe (from what I've been seeing) that this is stemming from them raising tuition in the middle of a pandemic, that's the main reason. Personally I don't think there would be a protest happening if this was under \"normal\" circumstances. But the reasoning for it still stands, including for those that do pay out of pocket and are in a financial hardship.\n\nNo doubt GVSU offers a lot of great services that are included in the tuition price and also from money raised for various funds. This is just a hard time for everyone attending the university.\n\nI appreciate you taking the time to give your thoughts on this, especially having graduated a decade ago! I love seeing alumni still keeping in touch with everything at the university, genuinely!",

Oddly as a \"recent alumnus\" back in the day I gave a speech at a CS class to talk about what the \"real world\" was like and I love doing that!\n\nThe pandemic is tough and strange. On the one hand - shit's weird right? But... to be completely fair, many of the CS professors (my eventual department... I was actually a TA / lab assistant for 3 years!) taught remotely already anyway, even 10 years ago, and many people attended remotely or read the notes/watched the videos later. It was a weird time even then. The services that can't be done remote suck (and it certainly wouldn't \"feel\" like college IMO) but the value and educational opportunities are still there! \n\nI think we all need to band together in the pandemic and the harsh reality is that it's very likely less people will go to college for several years, and to combat that the lost revenue needs to come from *somewhere* or else colleges will start losing the talented professors they have. \n\nA lot of people think colleges are just buildings/campuses, but that's not true. The real value is the professors. That might sounds strange, but I think every student who has the opportunity to pick the brain of as many professors as possible should take that opportunity. I started doing that my senior (and super-senior, see previous comment about changing my major) year and seriously regret not doing it earlier. I still remember several professors in the CS department fondly (is Jerry Scripps still there?!?).\n\nIf a 3% hike in prices will let the college stay the way it is now, why wouldn't people want to do that?\n\n(On a side note, as I've been very removed... my career has been WILD post-GVSU. Worked at several startups and big companies, ranging from web security to tax companies. Got to work with legends in the field, like Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Now I'm working at a large company that everyone would know the name of, working to revitalizing it. I was laid off in the pandemic, but discovered that the CS world, people were CHOOSING not to go back to work and coasting on the stimulus money for unemployment, which I worked into a $40k increase in salary! I'm shocked. The world is weird.)",

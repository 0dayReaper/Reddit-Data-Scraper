    "postText": "This is my first semester at GV and it\u2019s going okay, but my advisor is absolutely terrible. We\u2019ve been emailing back and forth for a month and a half now and she just won\u2019t give me my class list/takes at least a week to respond to messages. Is this all advisors at GV, or is my advisor just incompetent?\nI emailed her in late January about my class schedule for the coming year, because all my professors said to email them early to get your classes (because enrollment is in April or something) but my advisor just doesn\u2019t seem to do anything. She keeps apologizing for not responding, but then not giving me a breakdown of my classes. She also gave me a list but failed to look at my transcript and see id already taken the classes. Can I change advisors, or am I stuck with her? I\u2019m starting to think shes not going to pull through before sign up.",

My advisor didn't email me back for over a month once lol\n\nI have met with clas advisors twice in the last 2 weeks, it's nice because you schedule a Straight up time for you both to be there. \n\nGoogle gvsu navigate and set it up from there",

            "comment": "Every major is a little different but in most you have a professional advisor and faculty advisor.  While both help with many areas, generally your professional advisor can be most helpful with what courses you need to take and building your schedule while faculty advisors are great resources for future career planning, research, internships...etc.  So if you haven't been already, I would reccomend meeting with an advisor in your majors advising center.  https://www.gvsu.edu/advising/advising-centers-70.htm and if this is what you have been doing and this person isn't helping, call the advising center and ask to talk with someone else or see your faculty advisor instead!",

Colleges care about your money before they care about helping you find your best path. DONT get jerked around and waste money on classes that won't help your degree.\n\nAt the end of it all, it is a business and you are a customer. Make sure you're getting what you need from the system.",

    "postText": "Does anyone have any experience with the counselling center? I've never gone to counselling/therapy before (been thinking about it for years, but I always talked myself out of it). I have quite a bit of anxiety, but I'm wondering if I should bother. I'm not really sure if they can even help me, or if I really need to be helped. I don't really want to make a fool of myself to a complete stranger if it's not going to be constructive. I've heard some mixed things about the counselors and I really don't want to have a bad experience that scares me off from seeking help elsewhere. Sorry for the rambling, and thank you for any advice.",

            "comment": "I found it beneficial.  I struggled with anxiety and depression sophomore year at GVSU and my housemate convinced me to seek help.  I went for 3 semesters, the only thing I'd note is you are limited in how frequently you can go, I don't recall the limits but I believe it translates to once a week or every other.  I heard the same about counselors at GVSU and it seems to be a hit or miss, but when you find one that fits you well it is worth going.\n\nThere is only benefit in going, I would recommend going and seeing what you think yourself.  If you have never done therapy before as you mentioned, the first 2-3 sessions will be your counselor trying to understand you as a person before diving into anything else.",

            "comment": "I've been using their services since last year, and I would definitely recommend visiting the UCC. The first meeting is a screening/consultation, so it's not a therapy session, but a counselor will ask about your needs and recommend a few options. If you want 1-on-1 with a therapist at GV, you have a max of 10 sessions a year and would meet around every 2 to 3 weeks. While these sessions were a huge help to me when I was struggling with processing trauma, there are many other options that might be a better fit. Aside from the standard individual therapy the UCC provides:  \n\n\n* Tons of group therapy. There are identity groups (LGBTQ+ Therapy, Student of Color, and Black Voices), skills groups that focus more on teaching coping mechanisms (Art Therapy, Self-Compassion, How to Worry Well + others), process groups where you share with others weekly (called General Therapy), support groups for grief, sexual trauma, and veteran/active military support, and an Adult Child of Alcoholics group.   \n\n* Recovery meetings for alcohol and other drugs.  \n\n* Online workshops and other self-help resources on the UCC website. Say you can't attend the Art Therapy group: there's a 3-week online program that will guide you through art prompts and exercises. Check out the directory of self-help tools at: [https://www.gvsu.edu/counsel/self-help-directory-154.htm](https://www.gvsu.edu/counsel/self-help-directory-154.htm)  \n\n* Emergency services. If you are in crisis, you can call the center at (616) 331-3266 or go to STU 206 for an urgent care appointment. If it is after hours on-campus, contact your RA or GVPD, and they will consult the counselor on call. If you're off-campus, you can go to GVPD or call 911.  \n\n* Community referrals. If you need more frequent individual counseling, the UCC can help you find a provider.  \n\n* Outreach events throughout the year: [https://www.gvsu.edu/counsel/module-events-index.htm?siteModuleId=8BEB22D5-E16B-7BDE-C0A104132E7438D5](https://www.gvsu.edu/counsel/module-events-index.htm?siteModuleId=8BEB22D5-E16B-7BDE-C0A104132E7438D5)  \n\n\nAll UCC services are free. Also, you can utilize both individual and group services simultaneously, and you can be in multiple groups! At one point last year, I was in individual and attending two skills groups at the same time, and I gained something from each of them. If you tend not to feel comfortable, a skills group is great because it is mostly the counselor talking and coming up with discussion points. If you decide that you want to talk more, you can always join a General Therapy group that meets weekly. It's okay to try groups out or work with different counselors  \nI hope I didn't bombard you with too much information! Please DM if you have any questions!",

            "comment": "You should absolutely talk to someone. The Counseling Center is free and its purpose is to help students.\n\nTherapy isn't just for crisis situations. People talk to counselors for a variety of reasons and for any given length of time - sometimes that means a couple weeks to deal with a specific issue or long-term therapy to manage a chronic issue (like anxiety or depression). As someone with anxiety, I have a counselor that I have been seeing regularly to keep myself healthy. Sometimes it helps to say what you are feeling out loud to a neutral party. Counselors can give you tools and coping mechanisms, and shouldn't automatically resort to a prescription pad.\n\nSometimes you won't vibe with the first person you talk to, and that is okay. Personalities can clash no matter the relationship or setting. It happens. But please don't let that hold you back from talking to someone.",

I used it a bit and it was helpful but just ended up getting a normal therapist and psychiatrist when I was able to drive to them\n\nIf you are thinking about talking to someone about issues, just do it. The longer you wait it gets worse. I wish I took this advice seriously when I was younger",

Once for my parent's divorce, another to deal with some other family health issues, and the last was actually more for myself.\n\nI had never gone to therapy beforehand. It's really nice to have someone unbias listen to your issues. I maybe went to each counselor at least 3 times or more.\n\nThe last person I went to was great for some anxiety I had racked up over time, he ACTUALLY told me about some breathing techniques and I still use them today! If you don't click with someone at the start you can try another counselor.\n\nBest of luck! You can do this. ((Therapy will never hurt! It will either be beneficial or nothing.))",

They may give you some general advice and tell you to do X or Y to (maybe) help improve things. Or worse they could tell you to see a doctor to get anti-anxiety medicine. I don't know you but I know someone who can help you conquer these things and his name is Jesus. Talk to a pastor about this, I can offer church recommendations if you want to speak with a man of God.",

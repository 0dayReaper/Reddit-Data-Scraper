    "postText": "The 2020 election will be one of the most important in history. Make sure you are registered to vote, and that your vote is counted! \n\nIn Michigan, you must register to vote online by October 19th, or up to November 3rd at City Hall (bring proof of address if you're doing this - a photo ID, utility bill, paystub, lease/mortgage, or insurance card are all valid). You can register online at https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,1607,7-127-1633_8716_8726_47669-175878--,00.html.  If you wish to register in person, the address is 6676 Lake Michigan Drive, Allendale, MI.\n\nYou can also request a mail-in ballot via this link: https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/Home/VoteAtHome/#online. Do so as soon as possible to make sure your ballot arrives and is sent back on time. Your ballot must be received by Election Day, November 3rd. Send it back as soon as possible, or drop it off in person at your [clerk's office](https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/Clerk) or at a [ballot dropbox](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/Ballot_Dropbox_Locations_697191_7.pdf).\n\nIf you mail your ballot, you can track it here: https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/Voter/Index\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!",

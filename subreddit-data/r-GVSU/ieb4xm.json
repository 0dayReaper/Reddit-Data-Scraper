    "postText": "I called Campus Dining today to ask two questions cause I haven't bought a meal plan and with how bad things will probably get idk if I should: \n\nQuestion 1: How far into the semester can I buy a meal plan? \n\nAnswer: \"Anytime\". Cool. \n\nQuestion 2: If we go remote and move off campus, will we get a refund on our meal plan since we won't be on campus?\n\nAnswer: *crickets* \"Um, so right now there hasn't been a formal decision made on that yet, but when they do make a decision a email will be sent out to students\"\n\nYeah... I don't think you're getting a refund from Campus Dining if you buy a meal plan and don't get to use it. Which sucks cause they ABSOLUTELY should refund us (like housing) but... idk.",

Anyways if you do get one odds are they probably will do what they did last time and refund you for the amount of time in with how much you have spent and how many weeks of meals have gone through. Tbh though yeah literally ask a question about anything to any faculty member about anything and they probably will not know directly what will be done. The best course of action is to assume the best and assume what they did last semester which is refund everything but tuition based on how much of it is used up. If they don't then we will have to start some shit with the school",

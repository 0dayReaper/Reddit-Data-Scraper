I\u2019m going to be a first year transfer student (junior) this coming fall and will be staying at Winter Hall this semester. \n\nMy major is currently marketing and I was wondering if anyone here had any insight about the program at GVSU. Difficulty, best/worst profs to take, internships, etc. Also, even though a lot of stuff remains closed, what\u2019s are some fun things to do in GR/Allendale?",

And they are not limited to marketing. For some reason, every prof I've had for a MGT class has always been the worst. \n\nIf you're interested, make sure you take classes that double up on requirements. This will save you cash and get you out faster. Talk to your advisor. Also, I'm doubling up and getting the finance major as well. You can take all the upper Seidmen electives as FIN classes and then take a few more, something like 3, and have the double. Again, if interested, talk to you advisor. \n\nMKT 351 will be the hardest class you probably take. It's straight up consumer psychology. The tests, department mandated, were brutal. Other classes will be pretty straightforward from books. Lot's of group projects and presentations. Expect every upper level/mkt class to have a group project and presentation in it. \n\nGood luck!",

I know a lot of marketing students and they all seem to enjoy their classes for the most part. There\u2019s TONS to do downtown. If you\u2019re 21 there\u2019s a lot of fun bars to drink at, as well as a lot of cool restaurants. There\u2019s a phenomenal board game and comic book shop if you\u2019re into that, and a record store I visit a lot. Allendale is a little lacking in fun things once you\u2019re off campus.",

Not a big spender (obviously) and want something that would be frequented by my demo graphic (24 y/o male).Whats the name of the board game/comic book shop? Not exactly my speed, but it sounds interesting and worth a visit for sure.",

Bridge street has a lot of fun ones on the more expensive fancy end but are within a very short walking distance from the downtown campus; like Butcher\u2019s Union and O\u2019Toole\u2019s. The breweries are a huge hit with my friend groups and other students, like New Holland and Hopcat. The B.O.B has always seemed the busiest and most fun bar I\u2019ve been to. It has like 4 stories, each a different bar and restaurant. It\u2019s hard to explain without actually going, but absolutely worth the trip. You can\u2019t go anywhere in GR without finding a few bars or breweries. \n\nThe comic shop is called The Vault of Midnight. It\u2019s a super nerdy place but one of my favorites downtown. It\u2019s got a fun vibe and really really nice employees and just fun stuff you wouldn\u2019t find anywhere else.",

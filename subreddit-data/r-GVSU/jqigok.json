            "comment": "If you mean the LIFT surveys, then here's what the Provost's Office website says. This is about Winter 2021, but it mentions what's happening this semester too: \n\n&gt;As is being done in Fall 2020, LIFT surveys will be completed at the semester\u2019s end, and the results will be considered \u201cformative\u201d for faculty.  This means that the LIFT reports from winter 2021 are not to be considered in the annual review or future personnel actions, unless the faculty member chooses to include them in the process.\n\n([Source](https://www.gvsu.edu/provost/temporary-faculty-personnel-policies-for-academic-year-2020-229.htm) but this is behind a login screen.)\n\nThis is the same policy about LIFT surveys that was in place back in Winter 2020 semester. What it means is that the surveys will happen, but the results will be used as information for faculty to make changes in their teaching, but will not be used for making tenure, promotion, salary, etc. decisions unless we faculty choose to include those in our portfolios.\n\nMy understanding is that the reasoning behind this, is that the online pivot is still relatively new to everyone (faculty and students alike) and so LIFT evaluations may not give accurate information about teaching for a number of reasons. Therefore it's good to give them and get student input, but not a great idea to give them the full weight in personnel decisions that they normally have. That's my understanding, and I do not speak for any administrator here. (Although I will say, I agree with the decision.)",

I think it should be held against the professors and they should write a plan/contract on what they plan on doing to fix the following issues that students have. And obviously, teachers that are really trying most likely wouldn't be affected. Either way this is irri.",

            "comment": "It depends on which building you\u2019re in for the dishwasher. 2 bedroom apartment style on north campus do not have a dishwasher in the room if I recall correctly and neither does Laker Village. On south campus I know Niemeyer, Murray, and Vansteeland, (South apartments too I think) all have dishwashers .\n\nI think all bathrooms in GV dorms have a mirror. I always brought a full length mirror too for my room though",

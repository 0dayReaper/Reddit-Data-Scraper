My calc II class has 2 big HW assignments due on Sunday. I just don't know if I'm just unlucky or if others are having the same issues.",

The random classes that the prof cancelled for one reason or another, coupled with the fact that the majority of points are at the end of the semester is where I\u2019m at. Some profs just were too easy to cancel or didn\u2019t find an efficient way to lay the course out. I got approval for my final project just last week and basically have 2.5 weeks to make up like 60%\nof the total course points. Believe me I wrote a pretty harsh review and I rarely do them.",

But instead I\u2019m spending all my time doing homework and some of it is just busy work. To make it worse my dad is getting hip surgery and one of then things he really wanted to do was sight in a hunting rifle but I wasn\u2019t able to do that since I was swamped with hw",

However, the student population\u2026\n\nWhat actions do you think GVSU will take against the unvaccinated student population (without religious/health exemptions)? I don\u2019t see any consequences listed if you don\u2019t have it. I don\u2019t see them doing much to enforce it tbh (maybe no in-person classes until vaccinated).Thoughts?",

I would imagine it ranges from 85- 95% and at that point you can convince some students to comply. \n\nSomeone posted (and deleted) that GV will give students an \u201ceducation\u201d on vaccines and their efficacy first. If they still avoid vaccination, GV will make a decision on their registration  status. \n\nWhich will be interesting because outside of medical/religious exemptions, I don\u2019t see many students presenting a convincing argument for vaccine avoidance. \u201cI just don\u2019t trust it\u201d and \u201cI believe it is my personal choice\u201d is not going to fly",

From what I've been told there is a four-step process for students who do not wear a mask (which may be used for vaccination):   \nFirst, educate the student. \n\nSecond, ask the student to leave the classroom. \n\nThird, call security if they student is disruptive. \n\nFourth, file a complaint with the unit head. If the student continues to fail to comply, the complaint goes to the Dean of Students Office and the judicial/disciplinary process. \n\nALSO, if you're faculty instructor is not masking properly, go the the unit head and/or the Academic Dean's Office.",

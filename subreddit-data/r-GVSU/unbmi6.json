I was in a very similar situation, I both neglected an online sociology class and didn\u2019t tend to it due to depression and so I also failed the course, pretty embarrassingly.\n\nIf you\u2019re ever asked about it, there\u2019s no shame in saying that you were going through a really tough time, advisors and such appreciate that honesty, and especially if future semesters show you\u2019ve improved, then it\u2019d be clear the failed class was just an anomaly.\n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up too much about failing a class, you have legitimate excuses and you aren\u2019t defined by it. I failed that online sociology course in my senior year of high school and yet I\u2019m a recent grad at GV, most assuredly you\u2019ll be in the same boat in the coming years :). Congrats on getting into GVSU and being a high school graduate!",

My high school let me finish them all up later that summer when I was in a better place.\n\nAlso, I failed an essential class in my senior year and still got to walk at graduation. I finished it up over the summer, and they gave me a diploma holder with nothing in it during graduation so nobody knew lol. \n\nDefinitely talk to your high school and see what they can do. The other poster also made a great point about talking to GVSU. I can't imagine this would be a problem for you, but you'll want to get ahead of it so it never becomes a problem instead of going into damage control in case it did.",

I lived in Murray my Sophomore year and they had rooms on each floor with whiteboards and markers. I used to always study in there because it was always quiet and I could do my work out on the whiteboard. If not then your best bet is going to be the library (not what you wanted to hear).",

Well lucky for you I did manage to drive by the other day and I did see a building that is meant for like studying and hanging out but idk if it\u2019ll be quiet if that makes sense. Usually at Laker village the athletes live there and freshman so studying there might not be the best idea, especially if you need a quiet space.",

Not sure if it's the same nowadays, but I can't imagine it's changed too much. Just get into the building by 5pm if you need to use it after that. There are also 2 conference rooms on the first floor right by the doors that barely anyone ever used while I lived there.",

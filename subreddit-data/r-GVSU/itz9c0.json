Positive diagnoses across the country, in Michigan, and at Grand Valley State University continue to increase. When GVSU made plans for the resumption of campus learning and residency, I said we would make adjustments to ensure the continued health and safety of our Laker community. That time has come, and I ask for your understanding and support.  \n \n\nToday, the Ottawa County Department of Public Health (OCDPH), in cooperation with the university, will issue a \u2018Staying in Place\u2019 order impacting GVSU students living and studying in Allendale Township. It is important to note, students are expected to attend in-person classes on their schedules, campus operations will continue, and offices will be open. The order directs students in Allendale Township to remain in their on-campus or off-campus housing except to attend class, utilize food services, obtain groceries or medicine and medical care, for worship and religious practices, intercollegiate medically supervised athletic practices, or for employment.  \n \n\nThis order \u2013 which is issued under the law and is enforceable \u2013 begins tomorrow, September 17, and lasts until October 1. You can [view the order here.](https://www.gvsu.edu/tools/cloudstore/files/uploads/EC981716-91D1-C66D-4CB44199F6A93429.pdf)  \n \n\nIn addition, we must all understand and accept the highly contagious nature of the virus. Strict adherence to preventive measures is required, so take careful note of the new requirements for face coverings to be worn outdoors, distancing, and contract tracing. Fully disclosing contacts is strictly for the purpose of keeping our community healthy. Please comply to keep friends and colleagues out of harm\u2019s way.  \n \n\nI know you will have questions about how the order affects you, your academic journey, and daily life. We have additional FAQs related to the order on the [Lakers Together ](https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/)website, so please check it regularly for the latest information.\u00a0  \n \n\nThe university\u2019s [Virus Action Team](https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/virus-action-team-vat-34.htm) has recommended to the university\u2019s senior leadership that a step to Alert Level 3 is warranted, and I concur. This means extra vigilance is required of us all. Face coverings, social distancing, good hygiene, avoidance of crowds, and until October 1, remaining in your residence except under the circumstances identified in the order. Your adherence to the order will help us reduce the positive diagnoses, especially in off-campus housing areas, and make sure the order is lifted in 14 days.  \n \n\nThe university has [support systems](https://www.gvsu.edu/care/covid-resources-20.htm) in place to help students with a variety of circumstances, including technology, food, and mental health issues. Resources for employees are available through Human Resources on the [Benefits and Wellness site](https://www.gvsu.edu/hro/benefitswellness/). The university\u2019s Call Center is available at (616) 331-INFO (4636). Personal health-related questions can be directed to the GVSU/Spectrum 24-hour call center at (833) 734-0020. You can also direct questions to [virusactionteam@gvsu.edu](mailto:virusactionteam@gvsu.edu).  \n \n\nI want to thank everyone who has been following the guidelines and doing their best to stay healthy and prevent others from becoming exposed. This is a journey of a thousand steps. Walking together \u2013 but separately \u2013 will serve the common good.\u00a0 Please keep doing your part.  \n \n\nSincerely,  \n \n\nPhilomena V. Mantella, President  \n\n\n...",

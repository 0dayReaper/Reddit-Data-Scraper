The more expensive would be Enclave, Lodge, and Alpine.  \n\nTo look truly off campus use apartments.com and navigate around the areas, Hudsonville and Grandville are great options to be 10-15 minutes from campus, close to GR, but will not have a direct bus route to campus.  Renting truly off campus will usually be cheaper on paper, but will not include some of the common amenities located at the near campus apartments.\n\nEdit: spelling",

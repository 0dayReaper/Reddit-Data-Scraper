Difficulty for math is subjective but if you're decent at math they aren't hard.  They don't contain almost any projects.  The entry-level programming course is CIS162 Java Object oriented programming.  That class is project oriented, so you'll be learning the concepts through reading and the projects.  It's not bad difficulty wise first semester.  Second semester is CIS163 probably which is Java Polymorphism and Recursion.  What's gonna make or break the first year is your ability to program.  It takes a while to begin thinking like a programmer.  I recommend Professor Woodring and Professor Grissom.  The rest are mostly alright although I would suggest using rate my professors to find the ones you want to avoid.",

For example, for a social issues course requirement you can pick from like 20 classes to satisfy that requirement.  However, your major may also require you to take certain geneds as they are considered \"major courses\", such as Calc 1.  Calc 1 is a gened but it's required for CS majors.",

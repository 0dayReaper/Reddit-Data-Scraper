That quantity is just the total positive over total tests for those tests that GV is running.  Because it mixes in random testing, with some symptomatic testing, and some targeted testing of exposed individuals, it's interpretation is impossible.  It is not \"prevalence\" (because of the non-random part of the testing), but it also cannot be compared to the state/county values of \"percent positive\" (because they don't do random surveillance testing). That 3.32% should not give one more comfort given the mishmash of what that 3.32% represents. The percentage just shows the extent of testing (of targeted groups and  presumed exposed/symptomatic people) and nothing else.",

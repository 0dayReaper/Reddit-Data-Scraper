    "postText": "From the most recent GVSU Virus Action Team. \n\"Because all universities are not making the same decision, we have been falsely labeled as having the most cases at a public university in Michigan. If we reported only our on-campus numbers, as many others have chosen to do, we would have one of the lowest numbers of reported cases.\"\n\nShifting the blame instead of giving actual solutions concerning the problems with our number of cases. Thats a good look GV",

            "comment": "I\u2019m the email girl from a few posts ago. I followed up my scathing email about my testing experience with this one. I sent it a few hours before the VAT released the response you posted about above (I included links in the original email but I can\u2019t redo them for this post cause I\u2019m on mobile): \n\n\u201cUnfortunately I cannot find the time to speak on the phone - I'm in my first few days of graduate school so my free time is limited, and I have already spent a great deal of time trying to resolve this issue. I suggest you visit the GVSU subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/GVSU/) to read testimonials and concerns from students. I don't believe the feed has been previously monitored by administration, and although it is social media, I feel it is a valid, relaxed way to interface with students/faculty and hear their concerns.. Many students share my worries about testing and tracing at GVSU, and many have been negatively impacted by the current COVID-19 policy. In summary, the biggest complaints are as follows:\n\n1. Post coronavirus test, students are not receiving information about how to set up a spectrum account or where to go to get their results.\n2. Test accuracy.\n3. Safety of the testing facility.\n4. There is one human being fielding all phone calls about daily assessment issues.\n5. A complete move to online instruction for the rest of the semester will not even be considered until we reach \"high alert\" with a 7-day positivity rate of more than 25%, per the Alert Levels and Indicators page. If more than 25% of the student body is infected that is over 6,000 people. \n6. This article just published by mLive, which states that GVSU has the highest number of coronavirus cases of any university in the state of Michigan. It is important to note that the analysis in the article was conducted using data released by the schools (GVSU releases both on and off campus cases, while other institutions release only on campus cases), however the numbers are still striking and cause for immediate concern. \n7. The implications of corruption and special interest directly resulting from the appointment of the Vice President of finance to the position of Director of the Virus Action Team. \n\nWe are currently at triple the number of cases were last week. The testing procedure should have had every crease ironed out of it long before the random testing policy was introduced and students were back on campus. If we reduce all of the above issues to their simplest terms, people do not want to die, and they don't want their loved ones to die. Grand Valley has continuously made a mockery of these concerns by showing heinous disregard for student and faculty safety.\u201d",

Instead of owning up to their part in transmitting covid they say that they are only #1 for most cases in the state because they report off campus students infected. The email also never address any solutions on how they want to reduce the spread of the virus, as their plan is already failing as its pretty simple to see.",

GVSU  saying they arent actually #1 in amount of cases due to \"fake reporting\" is an attempt to shift blame. Our number of cases has everything to do with: Orientation for freshman still being in person with many people not wearing masks, some classes have no online option, Kleiner being filled with people past the capacity within the first week, and by a number of activities for residents in dorms still being held in person. The email only address solutions for those taking the bus as well as touching upon the self assessment and never mentions any further action to better our situation with long testing lines for random testing, some classes not being offered online even if students don't feel safe going to that class, and the self assessments before entering a building never being checked by GVSU staff. If you genuinely think that GVSU isnt shifting the blame then I think you are genuinely ignorant on a plethora of issues many other GVSU students are having with the current system GVSU has put into place.",

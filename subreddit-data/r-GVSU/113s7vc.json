The dates are flexible and can be shifted around to accommodate move-in/out dates. I found the GVSU offers furnished intern housing, but thought I\u2019d keep my options open before paying the application fee. Can y\u2019all point me to some resources or know of anybody looking for a summer sublet?",

I subleased from someone last school year who had the place for the summer so I know they offer it. It's not within walking distance of campus but there's a bus stop down the road if you don't drive.",

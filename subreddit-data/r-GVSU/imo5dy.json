    "postText": "Hi guys, I\u2019m in intro to philosophy at GV. It seems our focus this semester will be on Plato\u2019s Republic. I\u2019m curious if anyone who\u2019s been through this class before has any tips on what exactly I should be taking notes on from his online videos, and what his exams look like? He has all of his lectures video\u2019d on blackboard and I\u2019m unsure of what exactly I should be taking notes on, or if I should just read the book and watch the lectures to gain a better understanding of what I\u2019m reading. Thanks!",

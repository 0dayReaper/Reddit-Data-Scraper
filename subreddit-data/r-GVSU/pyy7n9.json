If that\u2019s theater, go audition or just watch performances, work backstage. If it\u2019s sports, find a club team or attend more games. If it\u2019s hiking, spend time on the ravine trails. If you like billiards, hang out in Kirkhof. There are so many activities to do around campus, if you spend time doing what interests you, you will meet interesting people.",

Clubs is a great idea too, great place to get started. Pretty much everyone at GV is friendly (to a varying degree), and as the bible says seek and you will find. Good luck to you and take classes seriously. I went to GV from 2018-2020",

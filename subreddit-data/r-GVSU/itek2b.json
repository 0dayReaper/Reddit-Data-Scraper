Rentals are essentially used books which don\u2019t have codes. \n\nAs for Mastering, if your prof is planning to use it they should have set up the course and should have the course ID you\u2019re requesting. If your prof isn\u2019t sure about the ID, try contacting the bookstore and see if they can help you out.",

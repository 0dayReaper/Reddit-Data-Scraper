I once had some friends sneak in crockpots and had a movie night in one of them. \n\nUsing a study room for your therapy call a perfectly good reason to use them. Just make sure you either reserve the room or nobody has it reserved.",

But they will have to let you into the building and into their room but its is another option. Yes the walls are thin but throw on a pair of headphones and shut the bedroom door and you should be good to go. Listen this is just a suggestion but honestly you can rent a private study room in the lib and it will be fine. However  if you have a therapy app during midterms or finals week  will be harder to get a private study room during those time as there is a high need for those rooms and they get booked up very quickly as its first come first served",

Lays out course expectations super clearly, gives you outlines for the notes, plus the material is interesting. All the non-anthro majors I know that took it loved it too. Can't speak for INT 201 as I haven't taken it, so maybe get some input from that side as well before choosing.",

Professor Wroblewski is great, and the coursework is actually pretty light all things considered. Plus the material is very interesting altogether. I cannot say anything about INT 201, but ANT 207 is pretty great.",

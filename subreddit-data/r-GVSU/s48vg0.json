I immediately ripped 'em up and threw 'em the fuck away.\n\nStay safe, get vaccinated. If you can get a booster, please do. I don't want to get sick. I'll wear a mask not because it's an inside rule, but because lots of young students are sadly indoctrinated with anti-vax, \"Whitmer bad mmmmmkayyyyy\", edgy tin foil hat wearing folk want to, \"break the social chains\".\n\nDo yourself a favor and think outside your own echo chamber of thought. If it makes you uncomfortable, tough, its supposed to. \n\nSigh.\n\nFollow the links that are posted on the note if you want, TLDR; its super anti-vax / reported deaths from vaccine stuff.\n\nEdit: racist and red hat were taken out. If you know why those two things go together, you know.",

Your comment shows me you took the time to review what the website says, and you concluded after careful observation that the claims were faulty. Good.\n\nI would disagree that every single claim is absolutely objectively false---most of them are totally outlandish, but some of them arguably could have stemmed from true facts, albeit exaggerated.\n\nEither way, you don't rip up other people's papers. You show objective evidence that false claims are false. For the people sharing them, they are fully convinced that you are the one with objectively false information---and if you censor them, you will lose any credibility you might have had in any attempt at discussion.\n\nFor example, my comments are getting harshly downvoted. It isn't quite the same as censorship, but it definitely tells me that my differing thoughts are not welcome here.

I am not attacking your character for the purpose of undermining your argument, so it is not ad hominem. I only like to be a dick when it is deserved.

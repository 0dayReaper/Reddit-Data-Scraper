I can\u2019t remember the exact title..professor was called Dr. Bob b/c he had a long last name. \n\nI\u2019m a huge history nerd, so I took a History of Medicine class for one of my writing requirement things (I graduated 5 years ago, I don\u2019t remember what it\u2019s called \ud83d\ude02)",

Hurry and send in your application asap.\n\n- fitness courses. I will be taking fitness walking next semester for 1 credit but I think it's one you can make worth more. Or weight training, spin, etc.\n\n- take a class that is 100 or 200 level in something youre interested in or a related field. I'm a Psy major who is taking a social work course because I'm out of useful Psy courses. I would make sure it's anything you're interested in first before it being \"easy,\" you know :p \n\n- careers class, just 1 credit but you can add it up with other courses\n\n- independant study. I did one to complete my anthro portion and it was easy. Depending on your major you may not be eligible though",

Even in covid, most of the work is done in class, so there isn't homework to worry about. The only con imo is that you have to pay for materials, it was 40 bucks or so. The curriculum is also more sparse thanks to decreased lab hour availability.",

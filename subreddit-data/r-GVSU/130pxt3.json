    "postText": "I registered for freshman orientation on May 9, but I marked that I didn't have any guests coming because my parents weren't sure if they would be able to come. Now my dad is able to make it, but when I tried to edit my registration it said that registration has \"met capacity.\" If I were to reschedule, I'd have to schedule in June, which is not really feasible for me since I'm an academic junior. Can I just bring my dad, or call ahead and say he's coming? It's only one person, I can't imagine it's that big of a deal, but I don't want to cause an issue.",

Parents are not part of the official first-year advising sessions, but there may be other activities that that they would be able to make space for him in. But they also might not--orientation is packed this year. If that's the case there are plenty of places for him to hang out on campus while he waits for you.",

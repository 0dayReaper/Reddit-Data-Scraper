    "postText": "GVSU recently posted an article 'revealing' the Pulse survey results regarding GVSU's course of action during the pandemic:\n\n[https://www.gvsu.edu/gvnext/2020/pulse-surveys-reveal-students-faculty-staff-confident-in-universitys-response-to-covid-19.htm](https://www.gvsu.edu/gvnext/2020/pulse-surveys-reveal-students-faculty-staff-confident-in-universitys-response-to-covid-19.htm)\n\nHere are the results that were included in the article:\n\n**Faculty/staff survey:**\n\n* 53 percent of respondents agree or strongly agree Grand Valley has a clear plan of action regarding health-informed policies and protocols for on-campus environments\n* 76 percent\u00a0of respondents\u00a0agree their unit head or supervisor keeps them informed about decisions.\n* 96 percent\u00a0of respondents said they very often or always practice public health measures like hand washing, social distancing\n* 87 percent of\u00a0respondents\u00a0said they are familiar with available resources to help them manage their wellness\n\n**Student survey:**\n\n* 69 percent of respondents said they want to take a hybrid combination of in-person and online classes; 21 percent want all in-person classes\n* 56 percent of respondents said they feel very comfortable or comfortable with returning to campus in the fall\n* 55 percent of respondents said they would feel uncomfortable around someone who is not wearing a mask\n\nI know only 36% of the student population took the survey, but where are the rest of the results regarding how students view GVSU's response to COVID-19? The survey results that show the percentage of students that adhere to CDC guidelines? How students feel about the quality of their online education?\n\nI feel that GVSU is continually saving face rather than directly addressing the concerns of students who are paying to attend this institution.",

            "comment": "I don't know how one can look at this and can deem students, faculty, and staff are \"mostly comfortable\" with the GVSU Plan. This is a clever way of asking certain populations different questions or reporting only certain results for different populations. And even then many important results are in the 50% range which would hardly represent a \"mostly confident\" population. Like the hand washing and social distancing question for staff...like just because people report they personally adhere to guidelines has nothing to do with the decisions GVSU makes.",

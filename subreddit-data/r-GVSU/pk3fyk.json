    "postText": "I totally get that there are staffing issues, and it\u2019s of no fault of the students. But GV seriously needs to fix the lack of staffing on campus for dining. The few places that do have staffing, seem to still be pretty minimal on workers, and the lines get long and stay long. I can only imagine how stressed that must make the student workers. \n\nI\u2019ve heard it to be horrible managers, low pay, etc. but whatever the case, GV needs to address this, and soon.",

I can only imagine with more students and covid measurements making it worse. \n\nNot gonna lie I brought a tiny rice cooker with a steamer, a microwave, and a panini maker just so I can \u201ccook\u201d some stuff in the dorm to avoid the traffic at campus dinning. If you need to go this route Target/Amazon has small personal cooking appliances that\u2019s pretty cheap, besides the microwave, you can score a personal rice cooker for &amp;10-15, and a panini press or other heating press or toast for less than $20. If you have more money to spear, a 3qt instant pot around $50 would be even better.",

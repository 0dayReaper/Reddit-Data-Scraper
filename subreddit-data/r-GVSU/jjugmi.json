I know I know it\u2019s a trailer park and all, BUT the rent isn\u2019t bad, the units are nice and spacious and I doubt they would care how many people lived there. Just a thought if you don\u2019t wanna pay ridiculous student housing prices",

They don\u2019t care how many people you pack into the trailer as long as their name is on the lease. \n\nRent was super cheap, $900 for a 3 bed 2 bath with more than enough space and quite nice interior.",

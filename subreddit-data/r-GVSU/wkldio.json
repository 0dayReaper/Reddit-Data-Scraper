    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman and I have a class (HTM 175) on the Pew campus, all my other classes are on Allendale. The students and professors I talked to on registration day said there was no problem with this. I'm wondering if I made the right choice and if going to Pew is an unnecessary pain in the ass, or if it's not too bad.\n\nThe only reason I chose this is because HTM 175 seemed like the most interesting class that covers Global Perspectives, but it's only offered at Pew.",

I'm concerned about the temporary availability of the course materials in McGraw Hill Connect. I am wondering if there is an equivalent open source textbook or a paper edition that I might purchase. It would be nice to be able to preserve access to my educational resources (especially at the price of $x per course) so that I can refer to them for the duration of my education, and beyond. \n\nSincerely,  \n\\[Name\\]\"\n\nTo amp up the pressure, you could cc the head of the department in addition to the course instructor. (But this might also put your prof on the defensive starting out, so consider whether it will be worth it to you.)\n\nProfessors forget that their course isn't the only one, and they forget what it's like to not actually have a salary. A reminder once in a while can be a good thing.",

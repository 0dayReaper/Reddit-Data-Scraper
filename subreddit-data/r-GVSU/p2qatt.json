I got an email about a Transitions Welcome event and when I looked at the GVSU page it looks like they've done quite a few transfer virtual event, but nothing points towards a tour or anything like that.\n\nI just really want to see where my classrooms are before the first day.",

There\u2019s a link here to sign up for orientation https://www.gvsu.edu/admissions/new-student-orientation-29.htm I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what you need? I know when I was a new student I had my orientation way back in spring/early summer so it might be too late for that. But the buildings should be open if you want to look for your classes! You can grab a map from the library or the student services center and walk your class schedule if nothing else!",

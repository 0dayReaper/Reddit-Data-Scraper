    "postText": "Hello! I am currently a senior at an out of state university and am applying to the School Psychology program at Grand Valley State. I have a strong personal statement as well as good letters of recommendation. However, I am concerned about my GPA. The program website says that the minimum GPA has to be a 3.0, but mine is a 2.9. Do I have a chance at getting into this program? It's one of my top choices for graduate school. Thanks!",

The Admissions Office is primarily dedicated to undergraduate students. Each masters program has vastly different admissions criteria and it is the individual program staff  that determine admissions, so you really need to work with them directly.",

At least that was my experience applying to a competitive graduate program at many schools across the country!",

Based on that and the fact that your scores are so close you probably have a good chance! Definitely reach out to the program directors with any questions and to advocate for yourself.",

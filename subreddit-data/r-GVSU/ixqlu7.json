    "postText": "It may just be me and how my professors have set up their online classes. But I can prepare as much as I want for the week like when new assignment are posted on Monday or Sunday, but throughout the week more assignments are posted, specifically quiz and tests are posted on weekends and can\u2019t be accessed prior. This leads me to always having work on Friday/Sat/Sun regardless of how I\u2019ve prepared or the week. It\u2019s seriously annoying and I feel like I\u2019ll be doing work everyday for the next 14 weeks where as if it were in person the week would be potentially Monday - Friday like I\u2019m used to. Not saying I don\u2019t ever want to work on the weekend, but I just feel like I\u2019m being forced to, as I cannot prepare for the week like I\u2019d prefer.",

Another class leaks assignments randomly throughout the week with weird due dates (one day it's Wednesday 4pm another it's Friday 6:30pm). Then my third class is always due Saturday. \n\nNo idea how yall are keeping up when I have 3 classes and still need to attend to them all daily. I feel like I have just enough work\n\nEdit I've heard of 2am due dates too",

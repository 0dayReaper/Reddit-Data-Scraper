            "comment": "Three things come to mind: \n\n1. Seconding the commenter who said talk to your profs. If there's something you need, tell your prof as soon as you need it. This includes needs like better organization in classes and so on. Most profs I think are wanting students to give input on this, and it's hard to know what students need unless y'all tell us. (And everybody on our end -- faculty and admin alike -- needs to do better about taking initiative to open those channels.)\n\n2. I think it helps not only to take periodic long breaks but also to build smaller ones into your daily workflow. For example you can try the \"pomodoro technique\" where you work in 25-minute sprints followed by 5 minute breaks with longer breaks at various points. \n\n3. Also seconding the other commenter who suggested putting yourself on a schedule that gets your work done by Friday so you can have days off on the weekends. It seems impossible at times but it's doable if you're willing to eliminate distractions during the week.",

If you come up with a reasonable idea/plan going into your conversations with them, the worst they can say is no",

If you haven't already, before too long just drop your profs a note saying your appreciate their kindness. This is good for everybody involved and it's awesome positive reinforcement for the prof.",

    "postText": "Hi, just wondering if anyone knows some good areas to walk or hike near the campuses, preferably reachable by bus? I\u2019ve been completely isolated this semester and I need to get out of my dorm and get a change of scenery. So far I\u2019ve been walking both directions of the Fred Meijer Standale Trail. I think I heard something about Millennium Park, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to get there by bus. I\u2019m not from Michigan so I don\u2019t know the area very well lol\n\nAny recommendations are appreciated! Thanks!",

But if you could hitch a ride in a friend's car, there are so many nearby trails that are worth visiting. Millennium Park is great, Aman Park is a hidden gem not far at all from campus.  \n\n\nYou could also take the bus downtown and just walk down there! Plenty of sidewalks near the river if you want a more scenic walk.",

There are also a few trails on campus that go through the woods down to the river and to the boat house, the entrance is behind Seidman. If you head down to the Pew campus a good chunk of the river is walkable.",

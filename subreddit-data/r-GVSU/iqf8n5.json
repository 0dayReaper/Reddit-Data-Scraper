    "postText": "**I am NOT part of the Virus Action Team.** Below is an email: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\nDear Grand Valley Community:\n\nThe Fall semester is underway and the plans to manage the COVID-19 virus on campus have been implemented. The [Virus Action Team](https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/virus-action-team-vat-34.htm) has been meeting regularly, advising the Senior Leadership Team, and providing improved responses in a variety of areas as the campus and the surrounding areas have repopulated with our students, and more people are coming to campus. \n\n**Truth about dashboards**\n\nThere have been increasing questions about the number of positive cases associated with Grand Valley. Senior Leadership, guided by VAT, made the decision to report on our dashboard all verified positive cases associated with our university \u2013 all students, whether they live on or off campus, and all faculty and staff. This decision was made to provide the most complete picture possible for our campus community and to offer care and support for all students, faculty and staff regardless if they\u2019re fully online or on our campus. We are also conducting random testing. Because all universities are not making the same decision, we have been falsely labeled as having the most cases at a public university in Michigan. If we reported only our on-campus numbers, as many others have chosen to do, we would have one of the lowest numbers of reported cases. We are committed to the transparency of [our dashboard](https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/data-dashboard-37.htm), which is updated each weekday, and this is a case in which details truly do matter. \n\n**Testing updates** \n\nWe are conducting an aggressive testing regimen administered by independent providers. Thank you to those who have been selected for randomized testing and have gone to the designated testing site. Results are allowing a comparison of the percentage of positive tests within the GVSU community with those from the broader community. We have listened to the feedback regarding the sites, and we have made changes. We have added a second lab to shorten the lines for testing. The new lab has a promised 24-hour turnaround time for results. Spectrum Health has identified and fixed an issue with its MyChart system, which will speed up those results. \n\n**Buses** \n\nWe planned for reduced capacity on our busing. We learned during the first few days of classes that people still felt the Rapid buses were too crowded for the circumstances, so we immediately asked the Rapid for a remedy and they added three more buses for better social distancing and increased frequency. Ridership is 70 percent less than last year\u2019s level. GVSU and The Rapid are continually monitoring ridership for any crowding issues on the [GVSU routes](https://www.gvsu.edu/bus/). Our newest route, The Laker Line (replaces Rt 50 from Allendale Campus to Grand Rapids Campuses), has articulated buses with almost double the capacity of the standard buses and will also help with distancing and a faster commute.\n\n**Isolation and quarantine**\n\nThere have been questions surrounding when students need to isolate and when they need to quarantine. All the information is available on the [Lakers Together website](https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/) and specifically in [this section](https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/quarantine-and-isolation-information-for-students-42.htm). The information on this site is updated as warranted. \n\n**Call centers**\n\nWe have set up the Lakers Together call center (616) 331-INFO (4636) to take questions and hear concerns. It operates 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekends. Personal health concerns should go to the GVSU/Spectrum 24-hour call center at (833) 734-0020. \n\n**How you can help**\n\nTo help keep our community safe, take your self-assessment daily. You can get a daily reminder to do so, and you can put a [short-cut on your smart phone](https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/self-assessment-23.htm). The self-assessment is designed to trigger support from Spectrum Health and the university if needed. Please review our [face covering policy](https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/face-covering-policy-27.htm). \n\nThank you to those who are providing real-time, constructive feedback to what you are experiencing as we join the world in trying to live safely, mitigate the spread of the virus, while staying true to our mission. You can email observations, suggestions or questions to [virusactionteam@gvsu.edu](mailto:virusactionteam@gvsu.edu). We are in this together, and the efforts by our community to create the best environment for learning and living through a pandemic have been extraordinary. \n\nSincerely,\n\nGVSU Virus Action Team",

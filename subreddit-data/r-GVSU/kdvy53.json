    "postText": "Hi, I was wondering if anyone here knows someone or if they themselves have withdrawn from a semester late into the semester (like right now). I\u2019ve been struggling with bad anxiety since September and might as well have not existed for the past 2.5 months when it comes to classes. I was planning on withdrawing if I couldn\u2019t manage but what happened was I thought we could withdraw till the end of November, so mid November I was going to withdraw but when I googled the gv withdrawal deadline, on the website it said nine weeks so I thought I had missed the deadline. So my anxiety worsened and I wasn\u2019t sure what to do/who to call but it turned out the deadline wasn\u2019t going to end till a few days after that. But I didn\u2019t realize the page was wrong until a week later, which by then really was past the deadline :(, so I\u2019ve been struggling to bring myself to call and I didn\u2019t till today and they said I need to call Records tomorrow. I guess I\u2019m asking what should I expect for tomorrow?? I provided this context so y\u2019all would understand why it took so long. \n\nTLDR: What should I expect when I call Records about withdrawing from classes due to mental health.",

There\u2019s a chance you can have your semester completely erased from your academic record if it\u2019s due to mental health reasons. Call them and say you need an appointment to talk about doing a medical withdrawal due to your mental health. Good luck!!",

They gave me some paperwork to fill out and it was easy, and then I had my therapist and psychiatrist write notes on my behalf, and included them in an envelope with my statement. The paperwork helps you with tuition reimbursement. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you are going through this. I felt embarrassed and discouraged while I was doing it, but it was really the best thing I could\u2019ve done for my mental health! The process was easy and everyone was gentle, I think GVSU did a great job at handling it and making it easy enough to complete while going through any kind of crisis.",

I believe that I filled out the Course Withdrawal form, and gave that and a letter to registrar from my doctor stating why I was withdrawing, and the statement about why. And absolutely! If I recall, I simply said what was going on that kept me from fully focusing on my classes, as much as I was comfortable with of course, and mentioned my doctor's note attached and that my doctor/psychiatrist had recommended that I drop, and stated my intention to return to classes once I felt I was in a better headspace. Maybe a page maximum. :)",

She told me to fill out a complete withdrawal form that is on the registrar\u2019s website (if you google \u201cgvsu withdrawal\u201d it should pop up) and to attach a letter explaining my withdrawal. I attached these to an email to regdept@gvsu.edu. In the letter, I put that I had been struggling with mental illnesses, etc. It\u2019s totally doable and I think the next deadline on Dec 21 so get on it as soon as you can. Staff are there to help, like their jobs exist to support students so take advantage of that bc you\u2019re paying for it (if that helps)",

If you are facing some form of probation, you can probably work something out where it doesn\u2019t penalize you next semester. \n\nI\u2019m hoping the best for you. Good luck!",

You can only withdraw from the semester if something serious has happened (serious mental health issue(s), a death in the family, you getting into an accident that will keep you bed ridden for a very long time in the hospital), otherwise you can\u2019t withdraw and have to finish the semester. I wanted to withdraw from a Psychopathology class that I was very close to failing, so I asked my professor if I could. He said I can\u2019t unless the school permitted it based on severe issues preventing you from completing your classes. It sucks, I know.",

Gv doesn\u2019t do a great job at helping students in terms of mental health and classes. I wasn\u2019t strong enough to tell them what I was going through mentally, and didn\u2019t have the motivation to go to the appointments I set up to figure it out, and by the time I did, they did not let me withdraw or wipe it from my transcript. Hope u have better luck than I did.",

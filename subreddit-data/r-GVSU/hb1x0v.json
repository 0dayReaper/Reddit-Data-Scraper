You need to have a great science and overal GPA, MCAT score, and the bonus stuff like volunteer experiences, clinical patient hours, etc.\n\nMichigan is lucky to have 7 instate medical schools, and I've heard great things about each one of them. Good luck!",

This applies for all types of graduate school, not specifically medical school. \n\nIt\u2019s a bit different for business school because a sizable component of your business school admittance depends on your career experience. Whereas with something like medical school, you typically go straight into graduate school instead of taking a few years off to get work experience.\n\nThe more reputable the undergrad institution, the more established the pipeline to top grad schools.  Also, the faculty at more recognizable undergrad programs probably have a lot more connections with the faculty at the top grad schools and can sometimes help backchannel.",

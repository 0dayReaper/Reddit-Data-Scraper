    "postText": "Anyone else notice that a lot of classes seem to be missing for the summer semester. I could have swore that when I was researching last year there were a lot more that were generally offered in the summer. Did they cut down on the number of classes offered for the upcoming summer?\n\nAny other interesting changes that anyone has noticed for registering for the upcoming year?\n\nFor me personally, there are only two classes out of the eleven I need and they are both SWS 300 level classes. God help me.\n\n*Edit: Additional Info Below*\n\n*Using the Browse Class view is considerably more effective than using the Plan Ahead view. I would suggest checking that out before just going into Plan ahead and entering the exact class you'd like to register for in the future.* ",

            "comment": "Okay so first off yes I have noticed that but first are you using \"browse classes\"? Because I was using \"plan ahead\" and it's not even updated with the correct classes. I found out to only look at browse after having a clas advisor meeting\n\nSws 300 shouldnt be awful, I actually found 2 sws 200 level courses I'm taking for that credit in summer myself though. I don't need them to be in my major or minor.\n\nI think the summer semester looks even more reduced than last year too but I may be wrong\n\nI only really need to fill up non major credits at this point so I'm doing a practicum and some random classes like fitness walking and those 200 level sws ones\n\nMaybe look into a practicum?",

(Summer teaching is voluntary for most people, not required like Fall and Winter teaching is.) So, many departments aren't able to offer as many sections as usual if they don't have adjuncts who can cover certain classes.",

They have runners at all levels and train for all types of distances.\n \n[Here is the Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gvsurunningclub/?multi_permalinks=10164078183665341&amp;notif_id=1593719905753730&amp;notif_t=group_activity) you can post there and see who is in the area and wants to run. And if we are allowed to have clubs in the Fall, you can keep running with us!\n\nPM me with any questions you might have",

Also what times do you guys usually run during the semester? I'd like to join but fingers crossed this pandemic winds down and my work/school schedule pans out",

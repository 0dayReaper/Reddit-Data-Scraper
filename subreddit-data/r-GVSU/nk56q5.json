    "postText": "So I'm taking fitness walking and also really getting into discing atm so I'm trying to find more good courses. I live closer to 28th st and play Lamar Park about every other day but im looking for any reccomendations!\n\nI do have udisc but I'm looking for word of mouth reccomendations. I played the one on campus like 6 years ago and remember it wasnt all that unfortunately\n\nEdit: hey guys so a lot of what was reccomended I *have* played before but it was before I got a little hardcore with discing and I just wanted to say I hit *every single course mentioned* and it was lit. I loved diversifying myself away from just Lamar every day and I appreciate everyone letting me know what they thought was the best. I still suck but man I had so much fun hitting these courses. I hit 81 holes this weekend not counting the time at the practice hole at my apartment complex\n\nMy best 9 was a +5 at heritage and that's amazing because before this course my best was a +9. Got an ace there once upon a time",

            "comment": "I'll list my favorites in the area, in no particular order - \n\nGarfield Park - 18 holes, wide open, easy to play, but also very enjoyable.  Tends to be pretty busy (at least every time i've been). \n\nJohnson Park - 18 holes, more difficult than Garfield, lots of elevation, but a great work out. I played today at lunch and walked over 2 miles. With all the elevation changes, it can be exhausting. Also, much more challenging.  If you are a begininer, this might not be the course for you. \n\nWellspring Church - 9 holes. This is fairly close to the Allendale campus. It sits on the land of a mega church.  The course itself is very well maintained, with newer baskets.  Most holes are fairly easy - only a couple are longer. \n\nOld Farm - 18 holes.  Good combination of wooded holes and open fields. Not terribly challenging. Very enjoyable course.",

            "comment": "The one on Campus you played was probably Campus View... which, unless you live there, is not really worth it.\n\nGR has a few pretty solid ones, off the top of my head: Earl W Brewer Park, Cascade Park, and Riverside Park all are pretty solid ones. If you're willing to drive a bit then Fallasburg in Lowell is THE park in the area to check out, love that one.\n\nIf you're looking for a complete list I would recommend going to discgolfcoursereview.com and looking up courses by location",

                    "comment": "+1 for Fallasburg. That course is great: there are rarely backups at the holes (even though they can be quite challenging), you don\u2019t get the groups of 20 adults/baby strollers/dogs that will not let you play through that you get at Brewer, and it is a nice quiet place to play(except for the occasional \u201cDamn it!\u201ds from people hitting trees).\n\nWell worth the drive.",

            "comment": "There's a small course south of 48th called Rush Creek that has a 9 hole through the local park.  There's not too many people that walk through the course, but occasionally it happens.  \nIn Hudsonville there's an 18 hole at Hughes Park.  It's 9 basket and 18 teepads, a kind of confusing layout but if you follow Udiscs map it's easy.  Every hole is less than 210ft so they're not long.  Few trees to attend with as well.",

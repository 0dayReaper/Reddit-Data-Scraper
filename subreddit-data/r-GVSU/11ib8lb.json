    "postText": "I have an internship in lowell and need somewhere to live from 5/6 to 8/19. I go to michigan tech and can pay rent upfront. I don't have pets, I do my dishes right away, and I don't have blanket views about groups of people, so I'm a pretty safe option.\n\nI lived in secchia last summer, but they dont offer that anymore, and I'd prefer something a little east of downtown grand rapids. I imagine most people are probably in Allendale, but I'm open to whatever comes. Student or not, if you have something in the area, shoot me a message.",

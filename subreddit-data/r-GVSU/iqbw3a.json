I think they are doing their best, and I know for a fact that they are trying their hardest. I think they are well aware that their best is far from perfect.\n\nThe truth is, though, that state funding is practically non-existent, enrollment is down, both because of demographic shifts and because of CoViD, administrators are taking pay cuts, and hiring is frozen. There is a very real possibility that GV could have to start laying people off. They have already asked some folks to take early retirement. Faculty are taking on higher teaching loads with no more pay (which means pay cuts if you account for cost of living increases), and support staff are adding covid related tasks to what they already do, again, with no increase in pay and no additional staff.\n\nAnd before somebody starts complaining about bloat, you should realize that GV already runs lean. Very lean. I know people think that administration rakes in big bucks, but GV is extremely admin light. A recent personnel audit showed that GV has roughly half the IT personnel that an institution this size needs, for example.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm saying is that yeah, GV kind of has their hand out, and it's kind of janky how they did this particular drive, but it's not because they think they deserve a pat on the back for their covid response. They really do try to put students first, even at the expense of faculty and staff.",

    "postText": "***OFF CAMPUS HOUSING GVSU RANKED BEST TO WORST***\n\nGrand Valley State University best off campus housing GVSU! :: Apartments, Townhomes, Cottages!\n\n1.) **Campus View** \\- SUMMARY: I recommend this place if you want slightly cheaper price living, are more college-oriented, &amp; you want a chill/quieter place to live with good community involvement.\n\nCV is lowkey kind of the best option. Location is close to campus but not so close where you feel like a freshman. It's also far from other complexes meaning noiseless living is as good as you can get. Staff is nice. Amenities are nice. Prices are decent (watch out for utility bill though). Internet is good enough. Parking is okay, $100/year for sticker. Party scene is not very present; sometimes small parties in the cottages. They have a shuttle--it's kind of awkward to ride. There's a lame $250 activity fee when you sign your lease because they host community activities--they're alright if you're with friends; it's also a good way to meet more friends and your neighbors I guess. Library is a 7 minute walk away and there's a 24/hour clubhouse with an okay study area. You can study during the week, wander off on Fri-Sat getting hammered wrecking other complex's apartments, then come back to your nice and quiet home at CV. Cottages are nice but more pricey, I prefer going with a townhome--the two floor designs are good for the price. There's also a great amount of outdoor space in this complex which makes it different from other complexes and more comfortable in my opinion. I'm sure apartments are a decent option too. If you take advantage of everything CV offers its a great choice.\n\n2.) **Meadows Crossing** \\- SUMMARY: I recommend if you have both the money and you are looking for a chill place with all your needs, and you're a little more focused about your college success.\n\nMeadows doesn't have their prices available publicly so here's a picture showing prices (from 2020) if you want to know them: [https://imgur.com/a/ZxW6iue](https://imgur.com/a/ZxW6iue). You can expect to pay anywhere from $500-650 for a 4 bed place (depending on what style &amp; length of lease) and like $800 for the 2 bed, which is kind of expensive. There's also utilities flat rate at about $50. Meadows is located straight across from GVSU where walking to campus would not be ideal but still an option. It's also close to many other complexes. They have a small line of shops that you will have very easy access to. I've yet to hear anything bad about this complex so I imagine they are as comfortable and nice like they advertise. Amenities are average + decent study area. Internet has no problems. No charge for parking is nice. Apartments and townhomes are fully furnished w/private bathrooms. Application fee is kind of expensive ($75) and there is a lame $220 community fee, but the community is nice I guess. They have several choices for apartment and townhome layout designs to fit your preference. Party scene is occasionally present, usually in townhomes.  I don't think you can go wrong choosing to live at Meadows Crossing, but it doesn't seem like the place to go all college-crazy and party if that's your thing. Overall, very good choice especially if you find a deal.\n\n3.) **TRIO Townhomes** \\- SUMMARY: I recommend if you want a good price deal, you aren't picky about finding a super nice place, and you want most everything other places have for cheaper.\n\nTRIO Townhomes offers a range of living styles and they're all good for the price. The more expensive you go the more private you'll feel. TRIO is located very close to the other complexes and does feel more compact, but the space inside these townhomes is better than expected. Amenities are not as good as other places but are still very good. Utilities aren't too much a concern if you are careful with usage. Internet is shaky at times. Staff is generally nice for the most part. The community is decent. They do require parking permit. The townhomes are not as up-to-date but it's not really an issue unless you're strictly looking for modern living. Party scene is average--sometimes present in the North/Center area. Noise level is good and peaceful, but is less quiet for the cheaper living options. They do have a shuttle to campus; bus stop can be a long walk away. They do offer activities which are good if you're with friends. Deciding between North, Center, or South is purely preference; they're all equally reasonable. Overall TRIO is a fairly solid choice. You will get what you pay for here as long as you follow the rules.\n\n4.) **48 West** \\- SUMMARY: I recommend if money isn't any concern, you want more trendy, active living environment, you want average size space, and you're cool with a more noisy/party vibe.\n\n48 West goes all out in making you believe it's the place to be. They are going to take your money so if that is not a concern then good for you. The design and colorful layout of the building, I think, looks appealing and the balconies are very nice, especially in the warmer weather. The nighttime look here is aesthetically pleasing. I personally only recommend to live here if you ask for the top level. The noise will travel from if your neighbors are loud. There's also just something better about living higher up. I would choose the townhome if you want more privacy and apartment if you want better living room space. Don't choose the pool view. There is private bathrooms. Amenities are good but kind of in the open. There is good spaces to study. Staff is average, sometimes they are helpful, sometimes annoying. 48 hosts activities/events weekly which are decent. There is parking permit cost. Overall, you are very much overpaying to live here, but the vibe of living here will be something unique. They should have more living space considering the price, but there isn't. If you're looking to view prices just create a quick account on their website. Party scene is frequent--48 is one of the best spots to go all out. Don't expect top-class modern furniture and amazing appliances. You're basically getting the same living conditions as other complexes but it's more expensive. It's a solid choice if you don't care about money and occasional problems.\n\n5.) **Canvas Townhomes** \\- SUMMARY: I recommend if you're not worried about prices, you want more modern &amp; spacious living, and you want more outgoing, lively, and interactive environment.\n\nCanvas recently got a remodeling which I heard is nice. I'm hoping the community/management will also continue to make changes for the better in the future. Copper Beech, Canvas former name, will forever have some badass memories so I'm expecting that they keep that same vibe. Canvas' location is decent--there are small ponds, nice scenery, and impressive design/layout; Canvas is basically it's own neighborhood so there is some comfort to that, and it's also not in the middle of everything. Staff is okay; there is some history of problems. Amenities are pretty great and 24/7, however, there's no pool/hot tub. They do have a nice area to study. Internet's good. The noise level is average. Pricing is pretty expensive plus flat rate utilities and parking permit. Party scene is present, mostly Fri-Sat--if you know where to go. Canvas is sporting a more classy look these days, but I'm sure it will still be a fresh choice for throwing bangers. Overall, it is upgraded living, but the price still doesn't seem worth it. If you don't care about money then go for it. Three-floors is nice to have, but you're a college student... stop bringing your entire wealth of belongings with you to college, it's not needed and neither is the amount of space that these townhomes offer (same goes for other spacious living options). Canvas is still a solid choice despite some flaws.\n\n6.) **Enclave** \\- SUMMARY: I recommend if you're looking for a more mature living condition, you have money, you want great space, and you are not worried about being close to campus.\n\nEnclave is one of the newer complexes. It is a nice community, clean, quiet, and very accommodating. The location is okay; it's more isolated from other complexes, yet, surrounded by other homes and businesses. You will have easier access to the shops on Lake Michigan Drive, including the pub, market, and GV party store. The designs here make it feel like your own home meaning you should have all the space you need along with private bathrooms. You will likely feel comfy here no matter what. Amenities are all good. The study areas work well, although I heard the clubhouse isn't always open. Internet is very good. Parking is fine. Staff and management could be better; they do have a history of problems like maintenance that should not even be a concern considering the price. There is flat rate $50 utilities added to this already expensive price. The party scene is pretty decent here; it can get lively Fri-Sat. Noise, however, is not really a problem at all. I wish the whole complex had more flavor and aesthetic, but every place looks the same. Overall, if you have the money, you will mostly be getting what you pay for here--but it's still very expensive. You won't be near any other complexes so it does feel a little left out in that sense.\n\n7.) **Locale** \\- SUMMARY: I recommend if you are looking for an overall average experience, an average chill community, good atmosphere, and money isn't too much of a concern.\n\nLocale's location puts it towards the center of other complexes, yet, it's not completely cramped. Outdoor space is limited to the interior of the gated complex, however, there is a nice amount of space inside the apartment rooms. The design of the 2-3 bedroom apartments is decent, but it comes at a higher price point since its less people (than 4) and more space. And of course utilities (flat-rate) are an added cost. The rooms have nice aesthetic and are relatively modern, plus I felt they give an overall comfier vibe than other complexes with neat private bathrooms. Parking does cost per year; Parking for guests is usually always full. I'd ask for an apartment on the top floor if you're looking to have the quietest living, otherwise, noise does seem to travel down from those living above you--not so good for studying. Also, living on the first floor makes you prone to ant/bug problems. Amenities are decent but some are located in the middle of the complex where everyone can stare at you. You can always make some new friends at the fire pit. Management has a history of having some issues so careful there. Party scene is occasionally present here but not really. I feel like there's too many people w/dogs at Locale. I think there are better places to live for the price they're asking. Not a place I would choose, but still a good pick I guess.\n\n8.) **The Alpine &amp; The Lodge** \\- SUMMARY: I recommend if you're a risk-taker, want a location more to the outside all the complexes, you have lots of money, and you want a modern upscale apartment.\n\nBoth these places are under the same management and are located side by side west of the other complexes. They recently took down the cost of living on their websites--so for 2020 it was about $560-600 for the 4 bed just to give an idea. Honestly, these apartments are very sketchy. I've heard negative mixed feelings about the management. The stuff they advertise, like amenities and top-class luxury living sounds like paradise indeed, but questionably remains true. I can't say I've witnessed any problems firsthand, but these apartments were never an interest for me, especially considering the price. Amenities are supposed to be top-grade, but eh. Internet is good. There's good places to study. Parking is like $10 a month; guest parking can fill up fast. I did not find the design of the four bedrooms appealing, but there is private bathrooms (as there should be). The appliances do look very modern and nice and the balconies are a plus (though should be bigger). The party scene presence is decent, there's usually something happening somewhere here on Fri &amp; Sat's. The size of the living space should be larger considering the price but its not. Personally, I don't find comfort living in what they're proclaiming to be a \"resort\". There's 3 levels so you will hear noise from people below or above. The third level is definitely my preference if I had to choose--for a cooler view and less noise. Overall, the Lodge and Alpine seem like more of a risk than they should be, yet, I also feel there's potential for improvements that are needed. For me, I would live somewhere else, but I'm sure you'll be fine if you choose to live here.\n\n9.) **Campus West** \\- SUMMARY: I recommend if you're looking for a basic place to stay that has better prices, you want good centered location, and you're okay with average living.\n\nCampus West doesn't really have anything special to offer. It's below average if you compare it to the other complexes, but that's also what makes it a slightly cheaper option plus flat rate utilities. The amount of space is adequate. The appliances and look is a little outdated. The location is good-- you're basically walking distance to every other complex and it has best access to bus routes. They do require parking pass. Staff is nice, usually. Amenities are good for what you're paying. Internet could be better. Study lounge area is average. They have some community activities that are okay. Parties are usually active here but can get crowded fast. Campus West doesn't really have any flavor in my opinion and for that alone I wouldn't choose to live here. The only real interest you should have in living here should be the prices. That said, as a college student, they have everything you need so if you're willing to get past some occasional problems then you'll be fine living here while also saving some money. Just watch out for random additional charges and make sure your inventory checklist is crystal clear. I think they made some recent improvements so it might look nicer here now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other less popular options that are worth taking a look at:**\n\nMystic Woods;  Greek Housing;  Conifer Creek;  Ottawa Creek;  Full Circle;  Boltwood;  West Wind Place;  Loft 45;  SM Communities Locations---Hightree/Sutter's Mill/North Ridge/Sailor's Cove North &amp; South.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A couple things to note that applies to all living options:**\n\n\\- All following complexes have access to bus stops that lead directly to GVSU campus.\n\n\\-All complexes have some form of security, however, they are chill as long as you're not an idiot. Safety should not be a concern for each complex as long as you're being self-aware on Fri-Sat.\n\n\\-All complexes will be a lot more enjoyable living in if you move in with people you know.\n\n\\-All complexes allow pets; make sure to read the policy that they have.\n\n\\-All complexes usually have or will charge for additional fees that make no sense. Essentially, you should read details of your lease. If you've never leased before, just know that it can be a rather strict process. I would not recommend blindly signing a lease without carefully reading through it.\n\n\\-Lastly and most importantly--you already made the mistake of choosing GV for college, but if you don't let the distractions of those around you peer influence your decisions; and instead you hang with the smart kids at the library, then you might not regret choosing GV in the future. Unless you're rich and got money to blow then do what you want.",

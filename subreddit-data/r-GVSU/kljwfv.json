    "postText": "A few students in my class, myself included, were documented saying negative things about our professor by another student and it was sent to her (nothing horrible or invoking violence or anything, just basically saying she was a bad prof and we really didn\u2019t like her). However, I did notice in the GVSU code of conduct that it could be considered a punishable offense if someone were to bring it to the dean. On the off chance she were to report us, is this cause for expulsion if it technically resides under free speech?",

If grand valley kicked out every student that had something negative to say about their prof there\u2019d be nobody left. We\u2019re adults, the profs are adults, and that\u2019s going to be how it is seen. Like you said, you didn\u2019t say anything horrible or violent so I doubt it will even be looked into. Whenever one worries about dismissal from school you have to remember that GV wants your tuition $ over everything. \n\nTLDR; Probably nothing, carry on",

            "comment": "I seriously doubt it. Simply saying a professor isn't good at their job and you don't like them is protected speech under the First Amendment. As another commenter said, if we expelled every student who said something negative about a prof, there wouldn't be any students left! \n\nI am no expert on the student code but I reckon that what would constitute something \"actionable\" here would be, for example, threatening a professor; or slandering them; or falsely accusing them of a crime or violation of university policy; and so on. So I think you're OK. \n\nAs a prof, if a student reports other students saying something bad about me, I will either ignore it, or --- more likely --- I will reach out to the students to see if there are any questions I can answer for them. I think most of my colleagues are of the same mind. We don't take it personally, we just want to get to the bottom of why students are unhappy.",

I can assure you that I care way more about respect for the first amendment than for what my students might say that is critical of me. Most university faculty are the same way. The first amendment is precious because it allows us as faculty to have views that challenge the status quo and research agendas that push society forward. Most universities are bastions of free speech, even if the speech is offensive. I would be surprised if GVSU was any different. The exceptions are speech that is racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. I have no inside knowledge of GVSU.",

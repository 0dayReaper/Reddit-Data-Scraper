    "postText": "Just a question, I have a generalized anxiety disorder that is pretty well managed. However, every once in a while I\u2019ll have a really bad day that can often make it very hard to remain in class, especially with my mask on, all day. Is this something the disability center can help with? I\u2019ve been told by a couple professors that even if I don\u2019t really need it all that much, it\u2019s not a bad idea to reach out to them and see what kind of services may be available. I suppose I\u2019m just curious if reaching out would be beneficial for me or my scenario?",

And in the end, it\u2019s not even so much about the mask as it is me wanting my professors to understand why I may need to step out a few times within a class every now and then. I\u2019m certainly not against wearing my mask, I just hate it as much as the next guy. Plus my claustrophobia and anxiety tend to make it a bit more of a challenge.",

If you're looking for some additional support for your anxiety, the University Counseling Center has recently rolled out some self-guided [virtual workshops](https://www.gvsu.edu/counsel/healthy-lakers-virtual-workshops-320.htm), one of which focuses on anxiety management. The counseling center also provides [a number of other services](https://www.gvsu.edu/counsel/our-services-91.htm) that you can explore if you're interested.",

You get to skip Gen Ed\u2019s which is sick, but you have to take a sequence which is like a really in depth Gen Ed plus more classes down the road. Make sure you pick the right one for you as almost all the honors classes are natural science related, and a few culture classes. Not all professors in the honors college are the same quality either.",

Then again, I have a part-time desk job to compensate, lol.\n\nFrom what I've heard, Honors gets a lot easier after the first year. Plus, you don't have to do your honors 400 class as a CS student. If anything, it's worth it for the nice housing.",

Honors is toughest the first year or two, whereas the cs/engineering majors get harder towards the end, so they balance each other out. Biggest difference will be you'll have a bit harder classes throughout, instead of starting out easy like others in your major.\n\nI highly recommend it though if you are the sort who enjoys learning. The honors geneds are far more interesting, and (at least in my experience) the profs for it do a good job of tailoring the courses for people who like a bit of a challenge but aren't necessarily passionate about whatever course it is (because it isn't your major)\n\nThe harder part can be finding an academic advisor who can help you balance the class scheduling. Generally you'll have to find time with both the honors and cs advisors. If you get lucky, you'll find one who knows both programs somewhat well.",

    "postText": "Hey yall! I\u2019m a Spanish major, so I had to get a supersite code. It doesn\u2019t say it expires, and since I passed both 321 and 322 without needing it (Fidalgo-Eick is the best!!!), I just have this supersite code that I don\u2019t need. \n\nIt\u2019s VHL online access code for the Taller de Escritores 4th edition book they use for SPA 321 and 322 alike. Profs like Pozzi require it as a part of your grade. \n\nI wanna give it away to someone, preferably someone who can\u2019t afford the supersite code for one reason or another. But ultimately it\u2019s first come, first serve. I didn\u2019t wanna charge for it because of the economic implications of the pandemic.\n\n*If you know someone who needs it, LMK asap.*\n\nI\u2019ll delete this when I give it away. \n\nThanks everyone!\n\nEDIT 7/15/2021: I received a handful of inquiries but today I finally found someone who was able to redeem it. :)",

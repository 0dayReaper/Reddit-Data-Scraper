    "postText": "EDIT: How heavily downvoted this question is seems a bit disconcerting.\n\nThus far, all of my classes have been streamed live due to people out for COVID. I don't understand why GVSU doesn't seem to be considering allowing individuals who wish to negate exposure to attend remotely. I am in my final semester and live with someone who immunocompromised and for who I am the main caretaker when needed. I haven't secured other livng arrangements because previous semesters have shown a trend toward GVSU making policy changes after certain points in the semester, and frankly, it would place a financial hardship upon me. I know some people certainly wish to attend in-person, and I understand that- I just wish the university would offer options for people who are experiencing life situations or related anxieties to make the decision to attend in-person classes for themselves.",

            "comment": "Full disclosure here, I'm a faculty member and do livestream and record my classes. And I don't speak for GVSU, my department, etc. \n\n&gt;I don't understand why GVSU doesn't seem to be considering allowing individuals who wish to negate exposure to attend remotely.\n\nGVSU as an institution _does_ \"allow\" this in the sense that it doesn't stand in the way of instructors who want to do it. Many of my colleagues and I do provide remote participation options. Some of us have been doing this since March 2020. And, nobody above me has ever said a word about it.\nBut, what you're seeing here is that _individual instructors_ sometimes don't provide this option, and the university has not stepped in and told them to start. So the university \"allows\" it, and in my experience even encourages it, but doesn't force that option to be provided everywhere. \n\n_Should_ GVSU step in and mandate that every class meeting be livestreamed and recorded, and remote participation allowed without penalty? That's an idea that has significant arguments both for and against. OP has outlined the biggest \"pro\" in my view. The biggest arguments against are probably \"academic freedom\" (the idea that professors may conduct their classes as they see fit, free from outside coercion) and the costs involved (of technology, training for instructors, etc.). \n\nYou may think those \"cons\" are BS, and that's OK -- I'm just the messenger here. \n\nGeneral note too: Don't just post about this stuff on Reddit, go communicate it to your professors and department chairs and the Student Senate. And especially, tell your profs what you need! Some instructors just may have never considered offering remote participation options or maybe they think nobody wants it. It won't be on their radar screen until you put it there.",

That is, I can voice my opinion to my professor, or to higher ups, but there isn't just one person in charge or listening to concerns and taking action. As I am currently experiencing a situation related to this, no one is willing to give the 'okay', but it also seems no one is willing to say, 'no way'- making a situation that could seemingly be pushed off indefinitely. I do also think it is pertinent to address that, at least for me, the thought of bringing these issues up directly is intimidating. There is such a polarized component to everything surrounding covid protocols and general operating procedures right now that I feel it would be foolish to pretend that there isn\u2019t at least the potential for backlash (even if it isn\u2019t intentional).\r  \n\r  \nWhile I do completely understand the concept of 'academic freedom', I do also think that it is irresponsible to consider this well grounded without acknowledging the current situation being that students are being put in situations that have the potential to make them choose between the education that they are paying for v. following protocols set in place for covid control or even looking out for their own best interest. It isn't as if this is a new and rapidly emerging situation- there has been ample time to develop operating protocols that benefit students in a diverse variety of situations.\n\nAt the end of the day, shouldn't the focus simply be on providing education?",

I\u2019ve noticed that my professors have been doing nothing to help covid kids with what they missed, which is the majority of the class, so it just puts them further behind. there\u2019s talk about not going online because of mental health, however, my mental health has gotten so much worse due to a) having to be gone from classes due to exposure and fighting for dear life to figure out what i missed (even on the second day of classes) and b) the stress of actually getting covid since my roommate is immunocompromised as well and i don\u2019t want to send a family members i see to the hospital by spreading it even further. Not to mention the kids left in class don\u2019t even know how to wear a mask correctly and god forbid the professors give them a simple reminder. GVSU is continuing to show they don\u2019t actually care about students well being.",

I try to do my best to ignore the individuals I see who aren't following the guidelines (because I\u2019m not even sure what other option I have)- I don't feel that it is fair to place professors in a situation where they have to police them, either.\n\n\r  \nGV should certainly have better protocols in place for those who make the responsible decision to miss class. Covid has been present long enough that there should be set guidelines that accommodate everyone, and it's a shame that EASY solutions aren't being deployed to ensure LEARNING. If this wasn't my final semester I would have left my program.",

It's concerning that a university would allow such policies that only negatively affect those who want to be responsible (or, who would think it- are too sick to attend class). What a shame that instead of progressively handling the current situation the university is choosing to allow students who have invested in their education to suffer due to the lack of planning and accommodation.",

My point is simply that it's pretty easy for a professor to turn on a webcam and allow people to watch the class at home while still allowing those who want to attend in person to do so. I've managed to stream several of my classes so far, with students in the classroom- even with a course that is heavily based on class discussions. I just think this should be offered to everyone given the situation, mostly because there are so many differences of opinion and situation it seems reasonable (to me) to think that accommodations should be made, especially when they\u2019re fairly easy. Sure, if a student isn\u2019t doing well with attending virtually, this can be revisited, but why not make things as accessible as possible during a chaotic time.",

    "postText": "Hello, as the title says, I am probably going to fail one of my classes for the second time and will have to retake it again. I know that taking a course for a third time is allowed but you need approval from your academic advisor and or the professors teaching the course but I just want to know if my \"extenuating\" circumstance is likely to allow me to be able retake the course again for a third time. \n\nSee the thing is I am living with a really rare form of brain tumor/cancer that started acting up last year and up until this past March I did not know if I was going to be put on Chemo and or if I needed surgery. It all started with a call from my doctor last winter when she said my tumor had started to become active and was growing from looking at an MRI scan. I then developed a lazy eye last May and so I had an emergency MRI at U of M and results were inconclusive. I had to wait till this past August to get another MRI which showed the tumor had not changed from May. My doctor then wanted me to get an MRI scan this past March which meant I was in limbo for around 7 months not knowing if my brain tumor was growing or if it was staying put. As it turned out, the brain tumor was staying put and not growing and or shrinking which is great news. During the Fall and early part of this past semester it has been really stressful for me. I actually had to attend some therapy sessions to cope with some depression due to my condition and all that had happened this past fall. I lost my Grandma and 3 pets of mine from old ages this past year as well which has been tough for me. This past year and beginning of this year has sucked and has had an impact on my life tremendously in a not so positive way. With depression an all, I sometimes would be so down on my self that I wouldn't even bother going to class because the whole time I was just thinking about my brain tumor and all that has happened this past year. My brain tumor is so rare that there is literally nothing about it on the internet and the stuff that actually talks about it isn't good. I just try to not look it up or even bother knowing the statistics because frankly it is not good and can really impact a person in a not so good way. \n\nAs for this class, I am so class to passing but I genuinely do not think I am going to pass this semester, if I fail it will be on the line between passing and failing. This is a core class for me in my major so I need to retake it in order to graduate but my advisor was telling me that I might not be able to retake the course. I am so close to graduating (literally 7 more classes) that if I can't retake it then it would be 4 years of college all for nothing. $80,000 dollars down the drain, it doesn't help either that I have a twin sister who goes to a private college and has close to $120,000 dollars in debt also because of loans an all. It would be disastrous for me if am not able to retake this class. I guess all I am asking is do you think I have a case that is worth a retake? In about a week or so I will find out if I can retake the course but if not I have no idea what I am going to do.",

I think you have good chances of being approved based on dealing with your own medical issues plus grief. \n\nHave a general idea of what steps you'll take to actually pass the third time (ex: have a tutor, regular check-ins with your prof). They will likely ask you why you didn't do a medical withdrawal to not fail the course. In my case, I was in denial that I couldn't handle everything at once so I kept pushing on for the semester and failed again.\n\nBe patient and kind to everyone involved in the process of trying to get approved.\n\nIn the absolute worst case scenario, you can transfer *some* of your credits to another university. You'd end up having to redo a year or two though. I think you'll be approved for the 3rd time taking your course though. Good luck!",

But it\u2019s good to know that there are others who have taken a course more than twice. The thing about this course however is there is no tutoring, and no help besides the professor whatsoever. Many kids fail this course and I have even talked to the assistant dean about how hard this course is the first time I took it. Hopefully change does come to this course for the better but I doubt it.",

GV doesn't want to keep you from taking courses you need they just want to make sure you pass, so this is basically them asking what happened and what do you need in order to pass. They put you in a remedial type class that meets everyday and the one I took had a student teaching 2 days and the prof wouldn't show up because it was their day. The girl I had did too many jeopardys and I left 20min early one time for a meeting with the DSR, we were doing jeopardy or something where we'd be in groups and I wasn't participating because it they were not helpful at all especially since she had trouble explaining things. She emailed me not too long after the class would've ended asking why, she literally said in one of her replies that 10 other kids weren't participating but I still needed to stay. So it's not necessarily all going to be helpful unless you have a better situation than me but it's not supposed to stop kids who are actually trying to succeed",

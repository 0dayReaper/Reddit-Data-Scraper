    "postText": "Seems like allendale is a dead town with nothing in the town or nearby besides GV. \n\nI just recently graduated but I must admit the school was extremely boring to attend compared to most other colleges in Michigan. The only thing within walking distance of GV was mully\u2019s, and even they were replaced by some super boring tea shop or something. \n\nLiterally if you don\u2019t have a car or aren\u2019t willing to drive to do something you have 0 options except lame ass school related activities. There was another post about how GV lacks community on its campus. This is why. There is nothing to do or go to that brings people together. Even our sports program is dying and they can\u2019t get people to stay past the first quarter bc it\u2019s so boring in allendale. \n\n\nYou want community in gv, get like a ricks or harpers or even PTs. \n\nOtherwise gv will continue to be known as the school where every student goes either home or to msu on the weekends bc of boredom.",

Anyway, the answer to your question, sadly, is no.  There is nothing to do in Allendale because it is an insular town full of people who have lived in the area for generations and whose idea of a fun night is a potluck at the local Reformed Church, then bed by 8PM.  \n\nMy only advice is to do what we used to do - carpool into Grand Rapids and entertain yourself there.",

            "comment": "Yeah it\u2019s sucks, urban sprawl in a mainly suburban area has basically fucked over all the students of GV. Not to mention that the school has been ratcheting up the price of parking passes. You even point out that for most students, a car is 100% required to be able to do anything if you live on/near campus. The supply is limited and the demand is high, GVSUs natural business approach is gonna be to raise the price. \n\nThankfully there is something you can do. Allendale Township has 2 meeting every month for planning and zoning. There was one yesterday evening as a matter of fact. The only people attending are the super wealthy people living in those big houses you can see from Lake Michigan drive. They want allendale to stay like it is, they love the urban sprawl and they love that there is nothing to do. Nothing to do means no \u201cunwanted\u201d people in the community. Obviously there push to keep it as is has completely fucked over the students of GVSU. But what if you and your friends started showing up? If more GVSU student started attending are really voicing the changes you want, y\u2019all could really really make a difference.\n\nA word of caution though. Don\u2019t go up in there hooting and hollering, disrupting their meeting. Go to one, take notes, see how they operate. Come up with a real plan, students ARE the majority and y\u2019all deserve to have a voice. But if they perceive you as a bunch of disruptive kids, it may totally invalidate any opinions you voice.\n\nIt\u2019s sucks and I\u2019m sorry, GVSU should do more and the town SHOULD do more. The reality is, the ball can\u2019t start rolling until someone pushes it along. Don\u2019t be the person who complains about it, be the person starts the ball rolling.",

But I would just advise anyone going to GV to manage their expectations and be creative. \n\nAllendale was and is a farming community where, even before the university showed up, families and homes were situated miles apart from each other. So there was never an urban or town core, like you see for example in Holland or even Zeeland. Dropping a college in the middle of that was never going to change the underlying social setup of the town. Add to this the fact that Allendale residents, having family roots here that predate GVSU for decades or more, still are not totally sure what to do with GV, and you have a continued town-and-gown situation. \n\nThe fact that Allendale is currently one of the most rapidly-growing communities in Michigan ([source](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/fastest-growing-cities-in-michigan/ar-AATwpkV)) means that this is changing now more than ever and I think things will be a lot different in a few more years. \n\nI happened to move to Allendale precisely *because* it's \"boring\". It's been a quiet, stress-free place to raise my kids and build a home. So also keep in mind that different people like different things for different reasons.",

Seeing the contrast between Allendale and my new city is crazy- it's very walkable, there's lots of stuff to do, and it has a much more defined \"college town\" culture. It's also continuously growing at a pretty rapid rate. However, the school I'm currently at was established in 1899, 61 years before GV. I'm hoping with time that Allendale will continue to grow and meet the needs of college students, but the layout of the town is just so not walkable and very much built for cars rather than people, unfortunately. \n\nI couldn't wait to get out of Allendale and I was so bored a lot of the time, but I do miss it sometimes for how cozy and quiet it felt.",

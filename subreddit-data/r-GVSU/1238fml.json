Sometimes a prerequisite is firm (e.g. you really need Calculus 1 before you take Calculus 2) but other times, it's more of a suggestion, and can be overridden. But be careful - if you really need that prereq, attempting to take it alongside the second course could set you back more than two semesters!",

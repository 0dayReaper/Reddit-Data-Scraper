    "postText": "Is anybody else in the same boat? Last week I was exposed to someone with Covid and then my test came back negative. Even with a negative test I still didn\u2019t pass the daily self-assessment because 14 days haven\u2019t passed since my exposure. So I call the GVSU-COVID hotline and am redirected to the GVSU Health Center who recommends I call the hotline again. Nobody can give me a straightforward answer whether I\u2019m legitimately not allowed on campus or if it\u2019s just recommended that I isolate until I pass the assessment. I understand the possibility of being asymptomatic and the test missed it, but there\u2019s just no clear cut communication and nobody I spoke to seems to have a genuine clue about what the actual procedure is. Should I get retested and see if that changes anything? I know professors have to accommodate students who can\u2019t go to class so I\u2019m not all too worried about that, I\u2019d just like to know what the actual policy as classes are starting.",

Have a sore throat and was exposed, but I took a test three days ago when my symptoms were the worst and it was negative. Now I feel a lot better but can\u2019t go to my class tomorrow. Not sure what to do here",

There are an insane number of schools out there that haven't made good decisions, or even *tried* to make good decisions. \n\nThe problem with this situation, which I've noticed younger folks in general struggle to understand, is that there is no \"right answer\" or guidebook to use to help with decisions. \n\nThe other problem is this strange sort of helplessness where people blame others, without accepting responsibility for themselves. I've seen people posting pictures of students massively not following social distance guidelines and blaming the school. I've seen students saying here on this subreddit \"if GVSU doesn't cancel classes I'm going to party like crazy to send a message about unsafe situations\". \n\nGuys, it's *all of our* responsibility to be safe. It's not someone else's job to to force you to be safe. If you feel unsafe *fucking leave*. Your situation at GVSU, where there's confusion about how to progress, matches that of *everyone else in the country* right now. It's not unique to you. Other schools don't have it \"all figured out\". No one does. You as *an individual* must do what's right and safe for you.\n\nI live in a small town in MA and people out here are having fucking house parties with hundreds of people, despite laws against it. People are going to be idiots everywhere, regardless of policies or laws.",

It does not mean there is _no_ virus in your system, just not enough to be detected. You may be infected and still have a low viral load, or you may not be infected.\n\nThe self assessment says that you should stay home. If I were in your situation, I would stay home.\n\nEdit: I think the conventional wisdom is two weeks between tests",

Basically, it's an intersection of legal, medical, and policy issues, and it's happening with staff, too.\n\nGVSU has contracted with Spectrum for medical advice and testing regarding the pandemic. Working with them, they have developed the daily self-assessment. If the self assessment doesn't come back \"all clear\", the question of whether to come to campus is murky.\n\nThe question of whether it is safe is a medical question, but how much risk the university is willing to take is a policy question. So, Spectrum is telling folks that they can't answer the question of whether to come to campus (because they don't make GVSU policy), and GVSU is saying they can't answer the question (because they aren't medically able to answer the safety issue).\n\nAdd to this the fact that saying \"come to campus\" and having an outbreak could lead to legal trouble, and you have a right mess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Nobody knows enough about CoViD-19 to say what is completely safe, and nobody has all three of policy, medical, and legal knowledge.",

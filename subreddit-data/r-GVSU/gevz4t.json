I was not certain were to go to college or what to major in but I am pretty certain I made a good choice.",

He liked the classes and his professors, got to travel out of state to conferences, and as a result of this was able to get an assistantship which covers all class costs to study at Syracuse for his masters in Earth Science.",

Our graduates are everywhere, and have no trouble finding work.",

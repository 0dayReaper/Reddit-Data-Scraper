    "postText": "I am considering withdrawing from PSY 300: Research Methods in Psychology. The deadline to withdraw is June 5th, and the refund deadline has already passed, so it kind of screws me over financially. I got 50% on the last exam and if I got 100% on everything else (which I'm not) I could pull a B in the class. My house isn't friendly to online school by any means - I don't even have a bedroom to escape to for exams. I really don't want to have a W to ruin things down the line, as I have no idea how they work. Can anyone who has withdrawn from a class give me any advice and did it affect you down the line? Thanks.",

I'm not saying you'll get special treatment or a do-over on your exam, but your prof can help you think through your options and maybe help you see things you might be missing right now in terms of your grade. We faculty want to help and we like it when students talk to us! \n\nAs for your other question, a \"W\" doesn't do anything to your grade -- literally nothing. It's not a red flag or a badge of shame etc. I don't know of a single student I've worked with that doesn't have at least one W on their transcript. I certainly had a few back in the day after I noped out of a few bad courses.",

Especially now, with COVID and everything being online, if grad schools ask about your W, just say that online classes aren\u2019t your forte and you felt it would be better to drop it. \n\nFinancially, it does suck though.",

When I took it, lectured were extremely important to grasping the material and we did a lot of work as teams within class. If it\u2019s your first W, I\u2019d suggest dropping and taking it when it\u2019s in person.",

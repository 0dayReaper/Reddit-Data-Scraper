Copper beach is alright but I hear the screw u on utilities etc. Trio was prolly the roomiest and came with a garage for some places which was sick. The other ones like conifer I wouldn\u2019t recommend unless you wanna drive to every event/party.",

            "comment": "Locale sucked. Maintenance was awful (didn\u2019t come to fix my dryer for a full 3 weeks because they were \u201cworking on getting the apartments ready for new tenants\u201d even though I was one of their new tenants and was told repeatedly by front desk employees that they were sending maintenance. I would actually see them racing their golf carts up and down the parking lot, so definitely looked reallll busy. When I finally got ahold of the property manager instead of sending the maintenance crew he offered $5 so I could go to a laundromat. When I finally got the guys over to fix it, whole thing took about 10 minutes to repair). I also had a lab partner who said one of the maintenance men tried hooking up with her roommate and acted super creepy while being inside their apartment working on something (I don\u2019t know any specifics about how he was creepy but hitting on someone while you\u2019re inside their apartment is pretty unprofessional and uncomfortable). People leave their dog poop all over the property and the most that\u2019ll happen is an email from locale saying that can\u2019t happen but happens anyways. Their \u201cstudy room\u201d has a bunch of computers but most of them don\u2019t have a mouse or a keyboard to actually use them. Idk if that was from COVID but there aren\u2019t any other restrictions in that place and no one wears a mask so?) and their printer doesn\u2019t work either. Their gym is meh with hardly any equipment. Hard as hell to find parking spots and near the beginning of the school semester there was actually not a single parking spot on the property so I parked up against a curb and got booted in my own complex while also having a parking sticker (I didn\u2019t pay the fine but still annoying that that had happened to me). People also park like it\u2019s their first day in driving school and I\u2019ve seen multiple people back out/in to parking spots, scrape the car next to them, and not do anything about it. My boyfriends car actually was dented by someone who parked next to him and who then drove away without leaving a note. Their guest parking is maybe 10 spots and are constantly filled by people with parking passes even when there are spots that are available? Oh and people will park in the handicap spots without having a pass (my random roomie admitted to doing that on multiple occasions and said \u201ceveryone else does it! Why can\u2019t I!!\u201d). I lived in meadows for a while and it was phenomenal. Owned by local owners and they\u2019ll actually negotiate renting prices if you need that. The maintenance crew was fantastic, their pool was a good size and their hot tub was open year round. Only downside is that Meadows tends to be the place where freshmen/sophomores party and the walls between rooms are thinner than a tortilla. Also there would be people who would just stand outside the pool gate and wait for someone to let them in because they didn\u2019t live there and wanted to use the pool/hot tub. Meadows also has Tea Time, Harry\u2019s and insomnia located within it as well so big ups for that",

I was in the 1016X row and it was super nice, right next to the volley ball pit and close to the pool.  \n\n\nCampus view is probably all sold out at this point now though; I'd call them and check to see ASAP. Next best option would be Campus West, but try campus view first.   \n\n\nThere are no trees here and lights come in from every window window at night. Feels like a prison compared to CW. Parking situation SUCKS too. Management/property owners could give a F\\*\\*\\* less about you other than making sure you pay rent on time. I've had a lot of issues here this past year.",

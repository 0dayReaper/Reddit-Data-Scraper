All you need to do is guess last names and first name combinations and know the character limits for each.\n\nBy guessing generic names it is easy to aggregate this and shoot emails out in mass.  Crazy simple to do.  They could probably even gain more accuracy if they can find student names in enrollment records, scholarship awards, or social media skimming.\n\nNever respond to these emails, report them to the GV IT department and move on, as giving them information nearly guarantees future scam attempts or attempts at stealing personal information.",

Chances are you'll be targeted.\n\nHere's some tips with cyber security:\n\nAlways check grammar, spelling, and formatting on an email to first see if these seem out of the norm.  \n\nAlways check the email handle - is it from a reliable sender, is it obscure addresses like Gmail or Yahoo that anyone can use, or is the name misspelled from a reputable company like Apple, Microsoft, etc.\n\nNever click links unless you're sure they're reputable. \n\nIf they ask for personal information via email that's 99% of the time a red flag.\n\nUnfortunately these scams have gotten extraordinarily better in the last 5 years or so, but most are still preventable.",

If this was really coming through GVSU why would they want you to not use a GVSU email?\n\nIn case you're curious, here's how these scams usually work: You'll supposedly be setup as a personal assistant to buy products for a busy executive/professor/whatever.  You'll need to buy special business check paper and they'll email you a pdf that you print on the check paper.  You'll print a check for like $1000.00 which you are then directed to deposit into your personal bank account.\n\nBanks are required by law to release funds after a set number of days on checks deposited even if they still haven't gotten back confirmation from the originating bank., so it'll look like the check cleared in your account.  You are then directed to purchase items from Amazon or somewhere else, shipping directly the the busy whomever, totally like $600. You keep the other $400... sounds great! Super easy work, big pay day for you!\n\nExcept a week or so later when your bank finally gets confirmation that the check is completely bogus and you're on the hook for the full $1000.00!\n\nThis is a pretty common scam but it's easy to fall for it these days as physical paper checks are increasingly rare so many people have very little experience with how they work.  Combine this with the fact that college students are often hard up for money and it's not hard to see why someone might be motivated to overlook a few \"odd things\" and fall into the trap.\n\nYou've already blocked the scammer, so that's a good move. But sharing this here in case anyone else runs into something like this.  Awareness of the scam is the best defense from getting caught in it.",

    "postText": "Hello! I'm going to be a freshman at Grand Valley, specifically going to the honors college there. I'm curious whether the sequences would be worthwhile to take, as I have enough general education credits to request a waiver of them, and 12 less credits to take is pretty significant.\n\nHowever, the course contents do seem pretty interesting (I picked East Asia and the World, The Middle East Beyond the Headlines, and Water for a Changing World), and they might be good for meeting new people as someone more introverted.\n\nSo I'll ask, what's everyone who's taken the sequences experience with them, and would they be worthwhile to take even if I could waive them?",

            "comment": "To be honest, if you're not getting the credits out of them, it's difficult to suggest you take 12 credits for them. I took the American history/arts one, and while it was interesting, it was one of the hardest/most workload-heavy classes I've taken. I'm pretty introverted as well, but I tried to ask for people to hang out after class or get a meal or something, and nobody really reciprocated on that. Not sure of the exact reason, but that was my experience.\n\nIn general, if you want to make friends, I would put more worth into either meeting people in your dorm if you're living in one, or meeting people in a club you're interested in. My friends I made first year all lived on the same floor as me, and my second year all my friends came from the club I joined. It's up to you though, ultimately.\n\nHonors courses do tend to be good, though. I took the microbiology course with honors, and even though I hate life sciences, it was one of my favorite classes during my time at GVSU. My junior seminar was great as well. I wouldn't recommend taking 12 extra unneeded credits though.",

He's a really great professor, really loved the class. \n\nIt was funny because I took the class the same semester that the first season of Cells at Work (an anime about microbes and other stuff in the body) was airing. So as I was watching the show, lo and behold a week or two later the same microbes I saw in the show would come up during class, and I could point and go \"Oh, I know that one!\".\n\nI had a terrible Biology experience in high school, but that combined with just how good Dr. Morgan is made the class genuinely enjoyable.",

While the course seems interesting, 12 credits seems hard to justify taking out of just interest, and I should be able to make friends via clubs, since I am interested in a few if them.

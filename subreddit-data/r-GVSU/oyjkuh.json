If $20K/year is too high (which all college tuition is too high, I'm not arguing that), then ideally you have a $ amount in mind?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGVSU is making executive decision because they have to as an orginization. It doesn't matter what they charge for their services. Do you know people should do if they don't want to go to get vaccinated but still want to attend GVSU? Get one or kick rocks. No one is making anyone go to GVSU, go somewhere else. It's kind of like the whole \"this business wronged me and lost my future business\". Cool, go somewhere else.",

Students have committed to housing, rental contracts, classes. They have met roommates and started building relationships. How easy is it to \u201ckick rocks\u201d now? Do you have kids here? \n\nThe school is not listening to the majority. There are major health risk to these vaccines. Myocarditis is up. Blood clots, stroke, belle palsy, heart attack. Respiratory illness due to mask. Dental issues due to mask. Eye issues due to mask. Heard of VAERS? More adverse reactions from these vaccines than all others combined in over 15 years. Don\u2019t ask me for a source. Just look it up if you can still find it. \n\nI hope no one reacts negatively because it\u2019s on GV now.",

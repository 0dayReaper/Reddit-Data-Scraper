    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'll be interning in the Grand Rapids area for the summer, and I applied for intern housing on-campus at the South Apartments at GVSU. Unfortunately the intern housing administrators are not particularly responsive; would anyone happen to have any experience with them?\n\nAlso, being that they have not responded yet, if anyone is subleasing their apartment for the summer and still needs a tenant, let me know! My internship runs from May 23 - Aug 12.",

I was able to get on the MSU one last year and I had a ton of people hit me up after I posted that I needed a place for housing during my summer internship.\n\nAlso have you tried calling them? Here is the housing phone number for interns (616) 331-5828. If you tried calling the past few weeks and haven\u2019t gotten a response it\u2019s because of exams an all. You could just try calling the regular housing number, here is that (616) 331-2120.",

I did call the intern housing number to no response, and emailed them as well. I also called regular housing and they responded, just for them to say the intern housing administrators will get back to me lol. I paid the $60 application fee already so if I don\u2019t hear back I\u2019m going to be pretty mad haha.",

I would easily recommend the D&amp;D club and the tabletop gaming clubs, both of those were weekly fun last year if you're into those kinds of things.\n\nI was part of the eSports club my freshman year. From my experience at the meetings and in the discord, there was a kind of \"boys' club\" feel to it where a handful of upperclassmen kind of dominated the club for the most part, and it was hard to get involved as an outsider. However it's been 4 years since then so I have no idea if it's still like that. It's pretty much the only way to hook up to play video games with people on campus though.\n\nI'd encourage you to check out the college discord groups, several clubs are advertised via the school's discord page.",

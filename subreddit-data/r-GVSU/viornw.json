I am taking Principles of Chem I, Trigonometry, Exploring the Earth, Sustainably and Place, and Disorder and Injustice: An introduction to global studies. This all equals 15 credits. Is this schedule manageable, my advisors said it would be hard but doable, so I wanted to see from a students perspective!!!",

It\u2019s super important to take notes and ask for help (from the prof, classmates, or the tutoring center) for that class! I struggled in the class because I got lazy and didn\u2019t pay enough attention but it is doable! \nI took exploring the earth online so it might be different now but I found it to be pretty easy! It talks about pretty basic geology like the rock cycle and different tectonics. \nALSO I took sustainability and place and it\u2019s a really easy 1 credit! I think it was one or two small assignments and a PowerPoint and the class was 9 weeks. \nSorry that was super long! I think as long as you ask for help if you need it (don\u2019t feel embarrassed, chances are other people have the same questions), attend and pay attention, and put effort into your work, you\u2019ll do great! And it\u2019s okay to struggle sometimes. We are paying our professors to teach us and the university to offer tutoring. \nPlease feel free to message me if you have more questions!!",

            "comment": "It was by far the most intensive class I have ever had at GVSU. I took chemistry in 10th grade in hs but I was pretty good at it back then so I had high hopes but boy was I wrong. I dropped the class after 4 or so weeks because the problems and expectations they had for tests and quizzes were out of this world. My recommendation is don\u2019t take two physical science courses together (i.e. exploring the earth and chem 115) as they both have labs and would take up the bulk of your time. \n\nRemember you truly are a freshman. With that in mind do you want to be stuck in your room or in the library all day studying and miss out on things that make up the freshman experience like be able to go to football games, parties, and just be able to hangout with friends? Sure your schedule is doable for some people (no way for me though XD). But is it worth it? What about switching chem 115 or geo 111 with another sort of elective? With labs and all you would have 7 classes in reality and repeats obviously for a week so you most likely won\u2019t have any free time. Just something to think about but I mean if you believe in yourself and are really good with assignment due dates and keeping track of everything with a planner and can study hard then your golden but for many of us this is just way too hard. \n\nBest of luck!",

Sure people will say it\u2019s \u201ceasy\u201d or you\u2019ll be fine but trust me when I say that you will have no social time at all with trigonometry, geo 111, and chm 115 all in the same semester on top of two other classes. I have never heard of anyone taking those two classes in the same enrages because it frankly is quite hard. Personally I would do the above where I take one in this fall and the other in the winter and make up that one class I would have taken in the summer. You could also think about taking it at a CC but if you do decide to do that make sure you still have 60 credits left to complete at GV otherwise you won\u2019t be able to do that.",

I am almost certain that CHM 115 is offered during the summer. Also may I ask when you took chemistry in HS? If it was like me in 10th grade you are absolutely out of your mind to take CHM 115 but if you did take chemistry or AP chem in 11th or 12th then you should be fine. If you do fall into that first category tho I would maybe think about taking CHM 109 as it is meant to be a beginners course for CHM 115. I should\u2019ve done this which is why I believe CHM 115 was one of the hardest classes I have ever taken but I didn\u2019t and it totally screwed up my grade and was definitely my fault.",

Once you get past your sophomore year they don\u2019t even help you schedule classes anymore like it\u2019s all on you to do it XD. But CHM 109 introduces you to chem knowledge like sig figs and basic formulas and notation but in 115 they expect you to know this which was a deal breaker for me because I was like what is happening ?!? But trust me they should have told you about it because it\u2019s a great class from what I have heard from friends and they were so much better off when they eventually had to take chem 115. It\u2019s literally one of the hardest classes at GV besides the Physics beginner course and bio 120 which is general biology.",

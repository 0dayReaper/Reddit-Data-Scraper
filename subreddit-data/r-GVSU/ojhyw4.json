            "comment": "TL;DR -- Python has more use cases and better functionality for statistics or mathematics compared to Java (CIS 162).\n\nHowdy!  I'm a mathematics senior at GVSU and minoring in math stats and data science. I have taught myself Python and took CIS 162.  My personal recommendation for a stats major/minor would be Python (CIS 160).  Reason being is 162 is in Java, which is not extremely helpful to a statistics major or even mathematics.\n\nPython has more versatility in function in that there is less set up or structure, simpler writing, and very focused packages for stats, mathematics, and more.  The general structure in Python is easy to extrapolate to other stats program softwares such as R.",

            "comment": "CS/cyber security major here. I would definitely recommend python over Java. Python is a pretty easy language for a newbie while Java has a bit of a steep learning curve. Also, Java has a decent amount of setup that has to be done for a program to achieve even basic functionality. If you were thinking about a CS minor, then Java would be essential. But you\u2019ll probably be fine without it.\n\nWould also recommend maybe learning the basics of C++ on your own time as I ended up making a lot of functional notes in cpp files in stats last semester that were really useful for the class. Although you could probably do the same with python.",

            "comment": "Math prof here. I refer all my advisees to the Python course unless they are double majoring in CS. CIS 162 focuses on Java and using it to do enterprise-level software engineering. It's what CS majors need to see -- but most others would be better served with Python, which is simpler and more useful for non-CS applications than Java. Learn Python and then you can start tapping into the awesome Python libraries for statistics and data science such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). (In fact they might cover a bit of Pandas in the Python course these days.) \n\nAlso don't worry about your math, you'll get good at it -- we'll help.",

CIS 161 is also taught in Python but is more heavily focused on the math side of Python.  This includes exploring libraries like pandas which are used heavily in data science.  In CIS 160 I take a more general Python programming approach as the course is intended as an introduction to programming for the entire University community.  Of course, either CIS 160 or 161 will work as an introduction so whichever fits your schedule might be best.",

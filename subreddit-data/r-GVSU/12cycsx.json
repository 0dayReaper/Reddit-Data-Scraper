I have a g number but is there a certain orientation it\u2019s typed? As in 01xxxxxxx, G01xxxxxxxx, G-01xxxxxx? Was told by someone else it\u2019s an email but I don\u2019t have a GV email and the email I use to correspond with GV temporarily doesn\u2019t work either. \n\nThank you for any clarification!",

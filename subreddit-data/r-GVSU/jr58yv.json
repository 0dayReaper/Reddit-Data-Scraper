My roommate was tested Thursday around 4PM and it is now Monday at 3 and still no word on results. My roommates sister was tested as well and has not gotten her results back and it has been 6 full days since her test. \n\nThis just seems unreliable to me, that\u2019s 5-7 days where somebody could have it and be spreading it.",

We JUST found out half an hour ago that he was negative. \n\nI did see on Facebook someone said testing is really backed up right now cause of the surge in cases. It's annoying but hopefully people who know they may have been exposed to COVID are in self-quarantine while they wait for the results + wait for the two week period for symptoms to emerge to pass. That's what we're doing.",

While waiting 5-7 days is not ideal, people are doing the best they can. \n\nYou could call and just make sure they haven't lost your sample.",

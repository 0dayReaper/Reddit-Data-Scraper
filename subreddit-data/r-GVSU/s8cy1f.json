I think GVSU is trying to rebrand itself and is doing a terrible job at it.  \nWhen I went to GVSU it was very much \"Small city feel, big college experience\" but now GVSU markets the downtown campus like a \"Thriving city experience\" and is moving away from what I knew it as, while I was a student.   \nAlso, the Laker Effect campaign was good! There was actual identity that you could say \"this is my Laker effect\" I know that sounds cheesy, but hey, that is how I feel. I don't even know what the campaign is now, but chances are its really lame.  \nAnother thing is GVSU's leadership is all new people, almost no one is from Michigan. So now all these strangers are trying to rebrand GVSU, but I don't think they realize how terrible they are doing. \n\nSorry about this novel. I don't think this is just about T Haas leaving. I think it is very much a poor branding decisions made by the new higher ups.",

I believe one of the main tactics here is to bring in outsiders that are disconnected from the established GVSU system.  They make the tough calls that no one wanted to deal with over the last decade to move the university forward.  Unfortunately, it's causing more damage than it is good.  Lots of people are upset and frustrated in my area of work.  And with the Covid situation, it just really wasn't the best time to make sweeping changes.

The student body was growing rapidly, the football program was crushing it on a National scale, tons of exciting new programs and construction, there was this sense of energy in the air and you could feel it! Based on my own decade of experience, and after talking to some friends who were there before me, it seems like the \u201cpeak\u201d GVSU years were like 2007-2015. \n\nWhen I returned to class in 2018, I was shocked by how that energetic sense in the air had totally disappeared.  Everything seemed so much more administrative, scripted, forced and dull. \n\nI think GVSU\u2019s \u201csweet spot\u201d was being a solid, undergraduate-focused school that was engrained in the west Michigan community and focused on placing students at major Grand Rapids and Michigan employers after undergrad.  I think T Haas and the president before him (Mark Murray) knew this was the sweet spot and worked to develop that.  \n\nNow, it seems like the new president is trying to rebrand the school as an institution of \u201calternative\u201d education, focused on things like distance learning, returning adult education, inner city charter school outreach, etc - instead of keeping us in that \u201csweet spot\u201d that we used to be in. Those things are all great, but it\u2019s not what GV became well-known for in the region, and it\u2019s not why most of us chose to go here. \n\nIn conclusion, I don\u2019t like the direction that we\u2019re heading in and I hope it doesn\u2019t lessen the value of our degrees.  The energy is totally gone from the experience.",

And just the fact that they are as close as they are in tuition to a university like MSU shows how far away from that they have gotten. \n\nHonestly I'd like to see the comparison of parking costs. At the rate GV is railing commuters with parking permit fees, it might actually be a tighter race in overall expenses than just looking at tuition. That's just another example of how they're milking poor college students for every last penny.",

I get the idea that Mantella is more divisive than Haas, but in that regard, Haas never really rocked the boat. He was a fairly status quo president that seemed to generally carry forward the existing GV strategy (I'm not saying this was a bad thing, and I think that Haas was a unicorn of a president). I've been told that the Trustees hired Mantella as a change agent, as someone that would lead the University into an era of intense competition for a shrinking pool of prospective students. In comparison, the Haas tenure benefitted from a glut of qualified high school graduates that have since disappeared. Since the glut ended, GV appears to have held its own. If you look at WMU, CMU, EMU, and Wayne State, all have lost significantly more students than GV, which has only lost a few thousand since the peak in 2016/2017. All of this being said, if most students/faculty/staff don't like the direction that the administration is taking the University, that could be a problem.",

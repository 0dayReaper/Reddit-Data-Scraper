Since offices on campus remain open and our student staff are essential to those office functions, their employment can continue. **In essence, student employees should continue working as usual and their hours or participation within their hiring department should not be changed by this new order.**",

Stay at Home orders are essentially just placing limits on non-essential gatherings (like parties, which is what other people have pointed out). It's also largely a way to limit travel (for example out of state, or to other people's homes).\n\nIn other words you're calling it the wrong thing by saying Quarantine, nor was it ever a quarantine, nor is anyone saying it is a quarantine.",

The answer is yes. Will it be enforced as it should, or will housing be rearranged at all? Absolutely not. \n\nFurthermore, what about at my job where there are two people working the front desk, when my boss comes over to tell us something, are we now in violation of the order and subject to the heavy handed punishment you have mentioned? \n\nIn addition to this are we going to halt athletes from traveling? What about college campus tours? Oh, and our student commuters, what about them?\n\nIs it in violation for on campus dining to have more than 2 people working simultaneously? Because according to the order, it is. \n\n\nThe point i'm making is that GV/Ottawa county have presented the student body with unrealistic and unenforceable rules with very, very heavy-handed consequences. \n\nIf this order was enforced equally across all members of campus we would have record expulsion and an overwhelming number of misdemeanors written to faculty, staff, and students.",

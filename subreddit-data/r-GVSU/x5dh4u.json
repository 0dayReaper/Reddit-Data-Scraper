    "postText": "So I'm class of '23 in high school and I got admitted to GV over the summer. \n\nI know it's a PWI and I would probably stick out as a curvaceous black girl, but can someone list some pros and cons about the school? I want to put together a good and realistic comparison between other colleges. \n\nDrop pictures or stories! I'm open to everything. \n\nWhat are the neighbors like? What's the typical attire commonly worn? Are the frat guys like the ones in movies? Are there \"ragers\" every Saturday? Y'all got bullies?",

            "comment": "The availability of apartment style dorms is very convenient. GV doesn\u2019t have the best dining halls and as someone who enjoys cooking I chose not to get a meal plan and make all my food. \n\nProfessors and faculty here are very nice. They\u2019re all sweet and want students to succeed. I\u2019m very satisfied with the education and academic related knowledge I am gaining here. \n\nAs a newer school compared to MSU, UMICH, and etc some of the programs are still in the making. Majors such as environmental sustainability, horticulture, and around that field are limited. In the next 5-10 years I believe that GV will be able to create a good program though. I\u2019m a business student and am very happy to be in Grand Rapids as there are plentiful opportunities in the city. Other majors such as nursing and engineering are also great. \n\nAs a minority, I wish there was more racial diversity. This isn\u2019t something university can control but I found that it\u2019s  a small community feeling. I think it\u2019s good to keep that in the back of your mind when considering GV. \n\nIf you have any more questions feel free to ask. Best luck!\n\nEdit: grammar",

            "comment": "I am a junior at gvsu! I would definitely say that the people here are very nice from my personal experience. the campus itself has a lot of nature as well as public art. This could be a pro or a con depending on your personality, but gvsu is not known for its ragers. Rather, there are smaller gatherings of friends. If you want to go to huge house parties people typically go to a different campus. I would suggest also taking into account what you major will be and letting that guide your decisions as well! If you want a nursing/BMS degree gvsu is great but if you are majoring in physics not so much.",

Faculty are kind and willing to help if you ask. Decent places to study all around campus, food options available as well. Overall good place, but unless you have someone else paying for you, I'd suggest 2 years of community college first, since for a full load it's like $7k+ per semester",

However, the POC community that exists on campus is definitely a tight knit one. I haven't had to many issues personally due to race differences, but I have also heard differently from others. Some professors are certainly better than others but thats a given for any university and the school is very good about corrective action for that sort of thing.\n\nIts really about what community you want to be a part of, if you want to stay in the POC community you easily can but as well there are still plenty of organizations and clubs that aren't as racially diverse but very accepting. \n\nI have enjoyed my time at GV so far, and I'm very glad I decided to enroll here. I'm sure you will love it too.",

The Fraternities and Sororities are also a pretty good way to network and meet people your first year. \n\nI personally didn\u2019t experience \u201cragers\u201d just the occasional house party.\n\nMy advise, invest heavily into your program of study and get involved in student organization. That will increase your chances of having a fun and successful time at GVSU",

As a \u201ccurvaceous black girl\u201d you will certainly be able to find your place. Everyone here has a place, from what I can tell so far. As for parties, there are parties to go to if you want. And if you don\u2019t want to, then you don\u2019t have to. \nPros about the school, it\u2019s very very clean and modern and everything feels very kept up. Also, the food has been very good so far.\nAlso I like how we have our own campus, and it\u2019s not all strewn about throughout the city like a lot of colleges. \n\nFeel free to ask anymore specific questions you have!",

But honestly, GV is WHITE. \nwe have student groups like Black Excellence and Laker Familia to support black and brown students in part because it is so white. \n\nOP, I definitely recommend GV for many reasons, but please be aware that it is very likely that you will be the only or one of two Black students in a class of 30. I am sure that you will be able to find a community here, but definitely be aware that GV is NOT racially diverse.",

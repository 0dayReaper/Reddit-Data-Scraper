    "postText": "Im a grad student dealing with my own disappointments in the GVSU response. I want to write a long form article/essay about the leadership failures and money-gouging practices at GR. I have my own experiences to share, but adding the voices of others could be helpful. Again, I\u2019m not sure what the end product will be or how it will be published. Ultimate goal would be for it to be picked up by a local media outlet.\n\nEDIT: I should add I\u2019m not a journalist by any means but think my writing skills are up to the task. In addition I I will let you obviously see the piece before approving your name in it. Also, I\u2019m super busy so this isn\u2019t going to move at the speed of light.",

I opted out for the second test since I have no reason to believe I\u2019ve been exposed and couldn\u2019t fit it into my schedule this week. My experience with testing was pretty positive and overall no complaints, but my friends on the other hand told me when they went it took them an hour and the place was packed (people were standing 6 feet apart but still a lot of people).",

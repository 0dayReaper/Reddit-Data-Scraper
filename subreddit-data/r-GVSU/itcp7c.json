    "postText": "Am I the only one who thinks it\u2019s incredibly ridiculous that we have to pay to park on campus in the first place? I understand keeping lots for faculty and residential lots for those who live on campus, but there are always so many empty spots (especially in the pay to park by the Lakerstore). All I go to campus for is my job and a $480 parking pass seems ridiculous, and I can\u2019t just leave work to go pay the dumb meter. And I don\u2019t want to because I\u2019m already paying tuition and working for the damn university so what the hell should I need to pay for? Taking money from students seems to be what GVSU is really good at, and this is an easy way for them to do it (permits, tickets, pay2park, etc.)\n\nBesides the rage, I initially started this to see if anyone knows anything about the appeals process/how long it takes to hear back. There is probably a post similar to this already but I couldn\u2019t find anything off the bat.",

            "comment": "I was thinking about this driving in this morning. I came in a little later in the morning than usual, and whereas in past years I'd be hard pressed to find a decent spot at that time, this morning most lots were still 2/3 empty. So, the economics of the situation just don't add up. Clearly parking is a lot less scarce, so why make students pay more for it? Shouldn't it be *less* expensive? Yes, I know there's a cynical way to answer that question. \n\nPersonally as a faculty member, who gets parking as a perk of the job, I'd be 100% in favor of *not* getting my parking for free, and having every parking tag cost a moderate amount, say $100, and *everybody* -- from commuter students to faculty to the president -- pays for their tag. I'd have to pay $100 more a year than I currently do but commuter students would pay $140 less, and that's fine with me, and the university would make the same amount of money off of it.",

Worse, [all colleges/universities are currently funded below the level they were in 2011](https://www.bridgemi.com/talent-education/coronavirus-guts-michigan-college-budgets-and-its-going-get-worse) and COVID-19 hasn't made things any better.\n\nThe reason parking has a cost attached to it (and the reason there are so many fees for students) has to do with the Michigan Legislature's attempts to, on the one hand, cut funding for higher education - while - on the other hand, trying to cap tuition by penalizing schools for raising it to cover the shortfalls. Fees don't count as tuition - so many schools hide the actual cost of tuition in the fees they collect from students.\n\nThe other reality is that schools (like cities) charge for parking to encourage the use of mass transit - that's why GVSU pays to have the Laker Line running. They don't want to pay for maintenance on parking decks or have vast parking lots taking up real estate they could be putting classrooms and facilities on.",

If they want people to pay then how about making free parking zones that require you to walk a ways? Make it so I can park on campus, I wouldn\u2019t mind having to walk even in bad weather because at least I would be on campus. For a lot of us we are driving from far off campus like Muskegon or Springlake. Not to mention many students are attempting to work in between, before or after classes. How can you expect someone to take the bus to meijer or wherever and make it to work and make it to school? Most of us can barely afford to live let alone park because designated parking spaces cost way to much for a few hours. The parking situation makes me not want to even bother going to school in the first place.",

I won't have a car, so I thought I'd reach out and ask if buying groceries and stuff like that is in walking distance of the campus. Also, if there were any recommendations for fun things to do/see within walking distance to campus. Thank you!!",

You can also take the Laker Line (free for students) and hit up Meijer, Aldi\u2019s, Family Fare, and quite a few fast food/restaurants. As for things to do, you\u2019re within walking distance of downtown which always has something going on somewhere, especially with it now being summer time.",

There\u2019s also a 24 hour coffee shop called *The Bitter End* and a decent amount of parks and stuff nearby. As far as stuff goes, you\u2019ll be wayyy better off than your counterparts at allendale",

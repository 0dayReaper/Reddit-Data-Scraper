However, I know the college of nursing is extremely competitive, so it makes me worry that I could end up getting rejected. Is it worth it to go and take the risk that you could be rejected? If you do get rejected, what are the alternatives?",

Im not in the program, however girlfriend had perfect grades her first 3 semesters and was in about as good of shape as you can be to get in, but it still took her 2 tries to get in. Not to mention the program is extremely demanding both academically and physically (e.g. getting up at 5 am to go to clinical). They work you to the bone. In terms of alternatives, I\u2019ve heard that people who can\u2019t get in usually either switch their major to something like biomedical sciences or transfer to a nearby school\u2019s nursing program. \n\nBest of luck!",

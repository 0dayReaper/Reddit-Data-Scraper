    "postText": "Just wondering. I don't knows what my chances are of getting one, or what the Virus Action Team's opinions on those who ask for them. I follow all the guidelines- mask, everywhere, getting tested weekly, etc. I already sent in my request. Now I have a deadline for when I turn in my papers proving my religion. But since I my practice is a mix of Pagan and Christian beliefs in which I worship on my own in private, I cannot provide these. I'm very scared and super stressed out about this. I sent them an email explaining why I can't give them paper proving my beliefs. I follow all the guidelines, I just don't want to get the vaccine because of my spiritual beliefs. I'm backed into a corner because if I get kicked out of college I'm done for. My life will be over. Ill have no future. I feel anxious and stressed about having to betray what I hold close to me. I don't want to bother anyone, I just want to get an education. I know the college probably hates me now because they think I'm a crazy antivaxxer. I'm not even antivaccines. It's been two days and they haven't responded. I know how busy they are but they put me a deadline. I don't know what I'll do when my time is up. I'm trapped in a corner and freaking out. My anxiety goes up having to think about these things.\n\nI didn't intend for this to be so long.",

Maybe the wording of your initial request just needs a bit of clarification or something. But either way you\u2019ll be fine, there is also an appeal process on the remote chance your first request gets denied.",

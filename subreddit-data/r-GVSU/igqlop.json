Professors tend to be in denial about how much time they have left before the semester starts, and they want everything to be PERFECT before releasing it to students. This leads to delays.\n\nYou can always send a politely worded email to the instructor:\n\n\"Dear Professor So-and-so,\n\nI know it's been a busy summer getting ready for the upcoming semester but I hope you had a chance to relax a bit. I am excited to be in your class \\[name and section number here\\]; will you be posting information on the course Bb site or is there another place I should look for course information? With everything being different this summer, I want to make sure I am as prepared as possible.\n\nSincerely,\\[your name\\]\"\n\nThis should be enough to get at least a response with an ETA, if not prompting them to open the site then and there.",

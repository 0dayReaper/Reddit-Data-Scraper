It was a shock to discover how many known carcinogens that we still have in American home &amp; cosmetic products that have been largely banned in the rest of the world. \n\nNot to mention how much stuff is in our soaps, etc. that can\u2019t be scrubbed out by our sewage treatment, and that we know for sure is killing aquatic life in US streams and rivers. Tide detergent has all of this, in spades.\n\nThere are a lot of products out now that are far better for you &amp; the environment\u2026the Environmental Working Group (EWG) has a great comparison resource, [if you\u2019re interested.](https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/5851-TidePodsDetergentSpringMeadow/?formulation=6837)",

The two years I was on campus, I would frequently find the pod plastic melted in a lump to a piece of clothing. Can easily wash out of that piece of clothing of course. But a little annoying compared to traditional detergent and the point of Pods is supposed to be convenience.",

My roommates and I are calling soon to schedule a tour but everything I've seen so far has been pretty positive and the rent looks pretty affordable, what are some of the plus sides and what are some of the cons of living there?",

The townhouses are nice but they won\u2019t be as luxury as some place like the lodge, but this comes with how affordable they are.",

The clubhouse and other amenities are nice as well. However they have a 10 month or 12 month lease unlike other places that have a 9 month or 12 month. If you choose the 10 month you pay an extra $500ish compared to other places. They also don\u2019t have a great pet policy if that is something you are interested in. I\u2019ve lived in CV for 2 years now and had generally good experiences but the extra rent and pets is a big deal for me so I am moving complexes next year. If those don\u2019t apply to you then it should be a fine option.",

The townhouses are a little small and older, but the amenities and staff are great and something I miss. The room I had was very small though, and keep in mind that the unit that they show you during the tour is a lot nicer than the one that you'll live in usually!",

            "comment": "I live there now and have a lease for next year as well. I have a townhome with a garage, which is nice to store stuff. Maintenance is quick and will have most things fixed the same day if you put a request in before 2 PM. Quite complex for as many people that live there/being close to the school. Shuttle service around the complex and to campus. Not the most up to date decor on the inside, but still nice. The townhomes seem sound proof as we can\u2019t hear the neighbors, but individual rooms may be a bit thin. Depending on your lease and what you are looking for,  CV may be a little cheaper than some of the other complexes. Any other questions feel free to ask.",

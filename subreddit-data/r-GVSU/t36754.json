    "postText": "Back when I was getting my BS in IS a couple years ago, a lot of the CIS profs were pumping their chest over the \u201cnew CIS building going to be built in the parking lot area across from the Field House\u201d. Fast forward to now, no building and not even a shred of evidence that it was ever actually going to happen. Curious to see if anyone knows of this.",

            "comment": "I think its three fold, but I don't know for sure. You'd have to wait for a professor to weight in on this one i think. But this is my best guess.   \n1. that there isn't enough money to build the building right now. GVSU has taking an enrollment hit, like every university has. Also there are statistically less high school students in general, which is the prime candidate to go to college and pay tuition dollars. So with less college students overall, is less money coming into campus.   \n2. There isn't a ton of space on the Allendale campus for new buildings. Taking out a parking lot in Allendale would literally cause students to riot, since there is already a shortage of parking spots. There really aren't many places to build in Allendale anymore (even though there have been many building expansions), any new buildings would most likely get built downtown. GVSU has a lot of property in Allendale, but there is also a ravine running through a lot of it. We also have a golf course that takes up a fair amount of land that you can't put a building on.  \n3. The school of engineering got a new building a few years ago. The building already existed so they just converted its use over, which is a lot cheaper than building a new building which they would have to do in Allendale. Computing and Engineering are in the same college and chances are the college probably didn't have the money, or location/space to build another building in Allendale.",

When GVSU sells football game tickets to alumni, that money isn't going to reduce the cost of tuition. Some areas of the university make more money that other areas of the university. With housing being mandatory for first year students now, you can sure believe housing is making money for GVSU, but is that going to pay professor and staff salaries? Sure it's all \"Grand Valley\" but different areas of the university get different types of funding.",

Athletics gets general funding as well in the amount of about $6.4million, however they spend about $10million or so and cover the difference in generated revenues.",

It's comparable in cost with online-only programs from better universities, 2 weeks faster than many online-only programs, offers less in terms of accommodations and resources, and requires books too.",

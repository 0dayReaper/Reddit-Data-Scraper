    "postText": "My schedule (which WAS perfect when all in person) is now sort of a mess. I have several instances where I have online synchronous classes, then a 15 minute period until my next class which is hybrid. Living in Grand Rapids, there's no way I can make it to my in person class after my online class. Will there be spaces on campus for students to be online for their synchronous classes?",

            "comment": "AFAIK there's no rule that says students *can't* be on campus (and such a rule would be unenforceable anyway). The question is the availability of spaces. I know in the math department, we've been looking at some options including our Peer Collaboration Space (second floor MAK, used as a student work space, normally seats 50+ but that will be down to ~25 with social distancing) and some of our smaller classrooms that are too small for F2F meetings. \n\nI also believe the usual work spaces like the library will be open, but again the issue is going to be availability of space since it won't be open at 100% capacity. \n\nI've personally lobbied for the Fieldhouse and turf building to be outfitted with a crap ton of desks and chairs all set 6' apart for student walk-in use, but I don't think that's gotten traction. Even the football stadium could be used if the weather is OK.",

The best thing they can do is just come up with dumb shit like not allowing on campus housing students to have guests over who A) don't live on campus and who are then also allowed to B) have anyone stay over for the night like wtf. They should lower rent and housing costs then if they want to dictate so hard what we can and cannot do. This shit is ridiculous. If I was a freshman I definitely would recommend not going this year and just taking a damn gap year.",

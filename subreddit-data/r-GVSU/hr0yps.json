Anyone who\u2019s taken this, can you tell me a little about the course? Is it math heavy? Also I have Byron Devries as my professor and couldn\u2019t find any info on ratemyprofessor. Thank you!",

            "comment": "Hi there, actually Prof. DeVries isn't teaching it this year, I'll be teaching both sections (new faculty to GVSU - Erik Fredericks).\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1) It's ok to be nervous about it being fully online, but I'm going to do my best to ensure you have a positive experience in the course.\n\n2) Not a math-heavy course. The focus will be more on the software development process and making sure you have the background and knowledge to work in industry.  Ideally you'll have something portfolio-worthy to show off at the end as well.\n\n3) I am on ratemyprofessor, feel free to check it out.\n\nAlso don't hesitate to reach out if you're worried or concerned.  I'm not sure when I become a real entity in the system but I can send along my email if you PM me",

I'm a city person and haven't lived in a small town before and I really like the living options in allendale but I'm worried that not having a car is going to make it really hard for me to get groceries on the regular ( I cook a lot, cant survive without it) I might have classes on pew campus or the health campus, I'm a grad student. Any suggestions would be helpful",

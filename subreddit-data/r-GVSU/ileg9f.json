There\u2019s a guide on the topic here\n\n[https://www.gvsu.edu/housing/students/amenities-160.htm#cabletv](https://www.gvsu.edu/housing/students/amenities-160.htm#cabletv)\n\nPlease keep in mind that the IT department does NOT provide support for cable TV. All the stuff information is on Housing\u2019s website.",

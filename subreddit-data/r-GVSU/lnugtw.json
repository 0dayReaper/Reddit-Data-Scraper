The police told us to sit down (my first sem in south) and \"talk it out with them\" my second sem at gv (I lived at murray), me and my roommate this year had an issue, and they told me they can move ME since I have the problem. I even communicated e the people upstairs and they essentially told me to fuck off. I told gv that, and my Housing Director forwarded it to the RA, who then proceeded to do nothing even when I checked in. Needless to say, im at home, and GV housing sucks, and the police and housing directors don't care about you.",

There were times in my late teens, early 20s, when I was desperately seeking work and I felt like every job listing was just a disguised cutco ad. It got to the point where I wouldn't even have to get all the way to the building, I'd been fooled so many times that I recognized the direction I was driving as the route the damn office they were renting out (under a different name) and turn around.\n\nReporting them was fruitless.\n\nThat shit was so exhausting.\u201d\n\nexcerpt from a comment, cutco/vector marketing are the same thing",

I'd rather live in neimeyer, but in order to do that I'd have to quarantine on my own and as I'm looking at hotels thats expensive. Should I just go with what they want me to do and live in laker village? \nOr is there a cheap way to quarantine somewhere?",

This sounds like you have been assigned to live there permanently, beyond your quarantine period. If you want to live elsewhere, yes, you would need to apply to switch.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! If you like reading or collecting comic books, watching superhero movies and shows, playing video games, or really ANYTHING else that is nerdy, you would be a great fit for comic book club. I know it is super hard meeting new people on campus during the pandemic, especially if this is the first time you've ever been to GVSU. We're planning on some movie nights over netflix party and maybe some game nights over discord! There is very little commitment to this club, it's all about making friends and sharing nerdy interests together. \n\nIf you think you might be interested just send me a chat message and I'd be happy to get you involved and added to the email list. My name is Charlie and I'd love to add some new members to the club!",

    "postText": "After seeing the better potential business opportunities in the graphic design field, I\u2019ve been torn between the graphic design and illustration emphasis in the fine arts degree. \n\nIve almost considering going back to community college to get my associates in GD so that I can pursue illustration for the time being. Lord knows that the debt would still be high though. But Anyways, Does anyone have any experience with graphic design at GVSU or any input about the classes? Thanks.",

Graphic design is about learning to use programs, but most work you are going to do is going to be digital, so having a coding background, or web development background combined with a minor or interest in graphic design is going to be more beneficial than an Art Degree.",

Strong fundamentals leading into Print and Publication, Logo, Web Interface, even some packaging. You really do get to experience a variety of classes and projects, which is really neat. It also culminates well with the senior portfolio project, where you essentially spend a year developing a huge brand identity of your choosing, which is really neat and will be a core piece of your professional portfolio. From my experiences though, where it comes short is pushing beyond. If you have an idea of what you want to go into in particular, then the program might have a lot of fluff for you, or not prepare you as much as a more specific program at other schools. For example, if you know you want to go into front end web, then you might find a lack of html in the required classes. Although you might supplement that with your minor. This could have changed since my time though.\n\nLastly, I think to get the most out of the program, the more you can curb the software learning experience the better. During my time, I didn\u2019t have as strong of a background with Adobe and that a tough hurdle to tackle while also trying to learn the course work.\n\nIf you\u2019re interest in the program, I strongly encourage touching base with with someone in the department to see if it\u2019s right for you. Again, things might have changed since my time there, but overall I felt the experience was really positive.\n\nI think it\u2019s also important to add, as the other comment suggested considering some computing instead might not be a bad idea. The world is becoming more and more digitalized, and so these print and publications jobs are becoming fewer with time.",

            "comment": "I don't know much about the program, but from my professional experience, the job market for graphic design is very competitive, and you'll most likely end up as a freelancer. \n\nThese days, companies keep a few designers in house. Our 2k person company only has 4, and we outsource the rest. If possible, I'd maybe add a marketing double major here since many companies would love just to be able to hire a marketer who can double as a designer when needed - especially small ones.\n\nRemote work will help your chances, but it will be imperative to have a strong portfolio and an internship before you graduate.",

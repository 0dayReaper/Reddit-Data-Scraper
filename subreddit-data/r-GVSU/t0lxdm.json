Plus if people are paying tuition and then skipping class that's on them. \n\nPersonally I haven't noticed much of a difference in attendance in my classes but I'd imagine in big lectures where the prof is recording it and posting it online afterwards it doesn't really make a difference if people are physically there at the lecture or watching it at home, so people don't bother showing up. That's just my speculation though.",

Further, they\u2019d have to admit they aren\u2019t geniuses or amazing, and hell will freeze over and grow candy canes before that day comes. \n\nI had mental health issues, I\u2019m also now a stroke survivor who tried to make gv work for me. Twice. They recommended a transfer and shockingly enough there are universities that care about their students priced competitively with gvsu. Mines completely online, public, and amazing.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to advertise so I won\u2019t name drop. Ideally, gv admin and faculty would act like the adults they\u2019re paid to be, but this is reality. Hang in there and don\u2019t be afraid to transfer if necessary. There are schools with great career services offices, amazing alumni and classmates, and that will work with you every step along the way. \n\nSorry this your experience. Wish I could help. Hang in there.",

I assume they don\u2019t want a mandatory attendance policy. \n\nMaybe a better question is if you\u2019re a student who isn\u2019t attending class for whatever reason, what resources would you want the university to make available to you and how wow you like it communicated?",

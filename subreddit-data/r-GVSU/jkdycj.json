OP, I\u2019ll be generous and suggest the professor may be an adjunct who isn\u2019t given training on this stuff (I don\u2019t remember anything when I was an adjunct), but if anything that makes it worse on GV\u2019s part. It\u2019s not likely that irreparable harm was done to students, but that kind of blatant FERPA violation can make the feds  pretty angry and endanger federal funding for GVSU. If the professor doesn\u2019t apologize and acknowledge wrongdoing, it\u2019s worth it to tell their chair.",

You \"own\" that information and it's your decision whether to reveal that to someone else --- not the prof's, not your mom or dad, or anybody. That's what [FERPA](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) is all about. \n\nEven situations where the names have been removed but the entries are still in alphabetical order is sketchy, because someone could infer whose grades are whose from the ordering. \n\nIf the prof really wanted to show the class grades on the exam, what they should have done was extract the grades from the gradebook, dump them into Excel, and then sort from low to high, then show the spreadsheet. That would have anonymized the data and would have taken roughly 90 seconds to perform. \n\nSo 100% raise this issue with the professor in private and explain your concerns, and if you're not happy with the response, the appropriate next step is to take it to the unit head/department chair.\n\n**EDIT:** *The ONE circumstance where this is OK is if you give your express written permission to the professor first.",

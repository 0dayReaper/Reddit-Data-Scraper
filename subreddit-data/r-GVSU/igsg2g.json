    "postText": "I know the entire situation of living/staying on campus is definitely chaotic rn and all up in the air, but I'm a freshman student who just wants to know if addressing letters needs to be different than normal. (Basically do I need to write my name on the first line, the building on the second, the building + apt. # on the third, town, state, and zip code on the fourth and address it in that order. Or do I just address it like a normal envelope with the standard three lines?) \n\nExample of this being: \n\nName\n\nNiemeyer West \n\nthe address, apt. # west\n\nAllendale, MI zip code (I'm too lazy to write a fake address out lmao)",

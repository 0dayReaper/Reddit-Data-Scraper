            "comment": "I am in the program. Wrapped up my first semester recently. I worked full time and took a class last semester, and did really well even without a background in CS.\n\nI think if you're passionate about learning and interested in the subject, you'll do fine. My advice be on top of your  reading and assignments. Try and knock it out as soon as you can because deadline can pop up before you know it.\n\nUse Google to supplement stuff that you learned in class or subject that you can't quite grasp.\n\nProfessors are available if you have questions. But ask ahead of time.\n\nClasses are at the Health Center and Pew Campus I believe, both are downtown, so Allendale may not be the best choice.\n\nI'd say live off campus with roommates if you can. My friends living at Winter Hall said it was not worth it, and having visiting there I can support that. It's just feels lifeless, but then again Covid may have likely made everyone cautious. However, do your best to make friends with your peers on classes.\n\nParking pass may or may not be worth it depending on how close you live to a shuttle bus stop. If your on Pew there's large public park lot nearby that you can park at and there's a bunch residential  street parking near Health Center if you're willing to take a short walk.",

    "postText": "im a freshman comp sci major that took chm 115 last fall (originally in engineering), and will be taking bio 120 next fall. Ive heard that bio 120 is pretty difficult, but i was wondering if anyone here who has taken both classes can tell me how these two courses compare in terms of difficulty/rigor. i really dont care about science related stuff in general, but i did pass chm 115 fairly easily (the lab sucked tho).",

I\u2019d also say you don\u2019t need as much prior knowledge to succeed in bio. Overall, less difficult but not really a class to slack on either.",

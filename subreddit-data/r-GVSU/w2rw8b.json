At first they only offered like 10 hours a week at most, but then I believe they got more contracts. \n\nPros: set your own hours, make up shifts on your own, completely virtual, supervisors are genuinely nice people, excellent training, you go in feeling pretty prepared for your first kid, you get to work with kids and instill a love of reading into them \n\nCons: not a lot of time for prep work,  pay is like $12.50 an hour, if they don\u2019t get reading contracts you don\u2019t get hours, I did a lot of work off the clock, the schedule is staggered so you won\u2019t be working 8-2, more like 12:00-12:30, 1:45-2:15, 3:00-3:45 etc. I wasn\u2019t a big fan of the chopped up day.",

I think I got lucky (or I was a fantastic tutor \ud83d\ude1b) because my kids were fantastic. \n\nThey showed up for session excited to read, loved telling me about their day, hobbies, interests, were excited to talk about anime, animals, video games. It was sad when the contract ended because they didn\u2019t understand why we couldn\u2019t keep reading together. \n\nI think I got lucky in that my kids all preferred non fiction books. To be fair the book selection was pretty sparse, but I was super excited to learn alongside the kids. \n\nMy biggest piece of advice is to have fun with it. Most kids do enjoy reading, and they definitely enjoy having an adult\u2019s undivided attention and praise about whatever they\u2019re good at. Every kid has strengths!",

I enjoyed it because it was generally low effort and the pay is better for the other GVSU jobs. I would only complain about communication and organization overall.",

            "comment": "This is an old thread but I know it might pop up for people in the future so I figured I should give feedback. \nI tutored for two semesters through k-12. It was overall a good job, but it has A LOT of problems. \nLike the top comment says, it's super nice for people who need the extra flexibility with their schedule since hours are broken up into sessions. Instead of working 9-5 you work in either one hour or 45 minute chunks. \n\nHowever my gripe comes with the specialists. A lot of the time they don't explain things or they just give wrong information. If there's ever an issue they need to solve it takes multiple hours, sometimes even days. Don't expect quick replies or solutions to basically anything. Not saying the specialists are bad or anything, just saying don't have high expectations about anything. \n\nFor me, I spent a majority of the year working with them being frustrated because of the uneven standards imposed on employees. Tutors are expected to be near perfect always, whereas specialists tend to get let off the hook for a lot of things. \n\nAgain, most of the specialists are wonderful people who do an amazing job, just from my personal experience I can say I likely wouldn't ever work for them again, not would I recommend them to people. I feel like the work environment online causes tons of unneeded frustration and stress for what the job is. 14 bucks an hour is nice and probably the only part of the job I can really say was worth it, other than seeing the kids improve. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm the only tutor who feels this way, but I'm sure I'm not.",

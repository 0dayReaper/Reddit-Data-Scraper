Just something I heard in passing so can't say that it's 100% fact.\n\nSelf cleaning windows have a coating on only one side though, so if these were installed backwards that would be 'em pretty ineffective: [https://www.explainthatstuff.com/how-self-cleaning-windows-work.html](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/how-self-cleaning-windows-work.html)\n\nI don't get over that way much but if someone is around there if they can tell if they *replacing* with new windows vs. simply taking them off and remounting them, that would probably lend credence to the rumor.",

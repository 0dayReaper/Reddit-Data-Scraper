But you do have to invest time to get through the program and training shifts. If you\u2019re supporting yourself financially, they don\u2019t pay you enough to survive, so keep that in mind.",

As others have said, the pay is atrocious and they get away with such low wages by telling you that you're gaining 'experience.' Keep in mind that shifts are 8 hours long, and you'll have to work on weekends/holidays. It's accessible experience for pre-med resume building, but IMO I would focus more on gaining research experience. Medical assistants also get patient interaction, and the pay is generally much better than scribing :)",

Yes I know other shots are required but I don\u2019t think those should be forced on anyone either. Also like the polio shot and such was one and done.  Now they want people to get a third covid shot!!  Make a vaccine that works and I\u2019ll take it. \n\nAlso since the vaccine doesn\u2019t kill the virus, your body even after the jab is a breeding ground for mutations/variants.  Those aren\u2019t just for the unvaccinated!  \n\nPlus I know like 10 people who got really sick after getting it (mostly heart problems and a few people passed out). Never seen that happen with a vaccine besides this one, at least not on the scale I have seen. Might be a coincidence but hard to say to me that it\u2019s super rare to get side effects when I know like 10 people who did",

A booster is necessary for other viruses as well (e.g., hepatitis, measles, etc.). I understand not wanting to have a shot forced on you, but you also aren\u2019t being forced to attend the university. These are jus the stipulations if you do choose to use their facilities, and so on.  Sure, it doesn\u2019t kill the virus, but that\u2019s not really the point of a vaccine. It decreases the spread and brings us toward herd immunity. It significantly decreases the chance of severe infection and being infected at all. You do you, but this is not new information on vaccines or viruses.",

I'm saying I don't approve of mandates for them.  Second what if the people making the mandates are wrong? For a very long time people believed that the sun went around the earth and they in turn were ostracized from society and even burned at the stake.  In addition mandates affect everyone differently. Yeah sure you are able to have access to the vaccine but what about people living in areas without access to it? How many walgreens and CVS's are there in the Bronx or Liberty city in Miami? We are suppose to just cut them out of society? Also if the government didn't do so many aborhant things like knowingly inject African Americans with syphilis and let it go untreated for decades while telling them they were receiving free health care, maybe people would not be so apprehensive about getting the vaccine! I would encourage my family members to vaccinated ,I just don't belive in the mandates!",

The  beautiful thing about science was that it was suppose to be challenged but now we are not allowed to do anything of the such.  The former CDC chief even said that he was threatened for believing Covid leaked from the Wuhan lab. Also to call me ignorant for standing up for the rights of African Americans who have a very low rate of vaccination and wanting them to still be member of our society regardless of their vaccination status really shows your true colors.

Yes delta variant covid is notably just as spreadable in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, but, the vaccine cuts the likelihood of getting covid by more than 1/2 according to this paper  [delta study](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/89629). Getting covid is sometimes as powerful as getting the vaccine, but it depends on how sick you get and for how long. Also getting the vaccine is helpful against a wider variety of covid variants.  I hope you are not getting a science degree, because if you are these arguments are reprehensible.",

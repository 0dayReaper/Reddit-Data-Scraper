    "postText": "**TLDR: GVSU cases per 100,000 is 117.5 which is a \"tipping point\" (per Harvard) and means stay-at-home orders are necessary.**\n\nA while back, Harvard (and Brown) came out with a framework to help leaders determine how bad an outbreak is at any given time in a population (they do it at a county level). [Map of all counties here w/ category explanations.](https://globalepidemics.org/key-metrics-for-covid-suppression/)\n\nBasically, you take the 7-day average of new cases, divide it by the population, then multiply it by 100k (to get the new cases per 100,000\\*\\*). Some argue normalizing can over-emphasize smaller populations (like GVSU), but I thought it would still be interesting to share where GVSU is at.\n\nThe most recent data is from 9/3 as I'm writing this. With the 7-day average as 32.9. that means the cases per 100,000 is 117.5 (for perspective, Ottawa is at 14.8 which is \"Accelerated Speed\"). The suggestion, by the framework, is that stay-at-home orders are *necessary*.  Not sure what GVSU's definition of alert level, but it probably shouldn't be moderate.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.\n\n\\*\\* yes I know GVSU has under 100,000 in their population, it's just about normalizing the data with other places with bigger populations (e.g. Wayne County).",

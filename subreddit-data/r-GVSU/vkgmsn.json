    "postText": "I am an incoming freshman at GVSU and I ended up getting a dorm style that I didn\u2019t really like. I originally had 1 bedroom apartment style and I requested either suite or cluster as my new style. Are these styles generally more popular or less popular and does anyone know the chances of not getting your request? Also does anyone have an estimated time for when a new assignment would be available?",

            "comment": "A lot of people want cluster but don\u2019t end up in it because Holton-Hooker is the only building with it, so the odds of you getting in are pretty low. I would say that you have a better chance getting into suite but it\u2019s still low because they\u2019ve already made the housing assignments. They will try to accommodate you but unless someone else backs out you\u2019ll most likely stay in your original placement especially if you listed it on one of your options and did your housing assignment late.",

It's a little farther from Holton Hooker and most freshman dorm areas but if you are prioritizing living in an apartment-style it's a great place to live. Also has a dishwasher which is awesome if you cook.",

My friends from the other dorm styles would come to my dorm because we had our own bathroom and sometimes would even sleep in our room so they could cook/bathe in a clean environment. It was honestly like a studio apartment. Having a kitchenette and access to the C store made life a lottttt easier in terms of eating because honestly the food options on campus aren\u2019t great. You\u2019ll be grateful for that personal bathroom especially if you\u2019re ever hungover.  Own bathroom + kitchenette &gt;&gt; any other dorm style amenity",

Personally I\u2019d rather live in a two bedroom or a 1 bedroom because roommates can be a hassle sometimes. It\u2019s just depends on if you liked living alone or with other people is what it comes down to.",

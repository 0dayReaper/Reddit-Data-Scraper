That being said... \n\nIts not actually tracking your location. Nobody on the app would ever know your true location. What it does is ping phones with the app around you with a low frequency sound (out of human hearing) and log anonymous phones that have interacted with you for specific periods of time.\n\nShould one of the phones that interacted with you have an owner with a positive case reported (confirmed by the app) it will ping all the app users that were nearby that person. All of the phone collection data is encrypted.\n\nYour phone does not give it information besides you user ID number (random generated) so your name and other data isn't even in the app which is a good sign.\n\nMy thoughts on it are with everything else going on from Google and Amazon this is the least invasive program you can make and it makes the community safer. I have much bigger issues with what GV is doing about the virus than this app.",

I don\u2019t think it tracks you unless the app is open. Truthfully, If you don\u2019t download it, you\u2019re not missing anything. It\u2019s been pretty useless",

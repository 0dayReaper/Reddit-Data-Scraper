They go all over the place doing that shit.  They're hypocritical as fuck too.  \n\nThey kinda stumble over their message if you ask them: \"If that fetus you save comes out as gay or transgender, would you love them unconditionally and accept them for who they are?\"  I did it once to them and after about 10-15 seconds of stuttering they went \"oh...of course, we love those people,\" in the most unconvincing tone you've ever heard.\n\nThey only care about the babies they save as long as they believe and live the same way they do.",

Lucky as I, resting bitch face and my \u201cbitch I will cut you\u201d eyes (and probably also the fact I was asian American which back then was pretty much nonexistent) saved me a ton of convos with these guys. \n\nJust remember they can say whatever they want since it\u2019s their right to free speech, but if they actively grab you or touch you or any other bodily contact, it\u2019s a violation and you can file a complaint with GV and also the police.",

Not to mention that everyone in this school has had different experiences and backgrounds, and those images could bring up past trauma or negative experiences for them. And the counseling center is right by Kirkoff so again, someone who could be dealing with past trauma could be affected by those images. It\u2019s such a tricky thing cause they are entitled to free speech, but the images take it too far in my opinion.",

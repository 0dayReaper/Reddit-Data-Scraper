I can't even rmeebr what day I have each class online its so fckn bad. ***This means apps too. I mean feel free to suggest but another web page or app to look at ain't  really it for me***\n\n And I also do not have other people to connect with to  remember assignments, so that's out the question as well. Taking 15 credits rn is very rough. I don't think online schooling has actually bothered me until now.",

I\u2019m so shit at using planners and reminder apps, I find it\u2019s much easier to have a big dry-erase calendar on my wall with all my dates, times, assignments, etc - that way I only have to write it down once and I have a nice overview of each month. I also use 2-3 colors for different things, 1 for online classes, 1 for in person classes, 1 for assignments. I put mine up right by where I put on and take off my shoes so I\u2019m forced to see it every time I leave my house.",

You can even submit a CARE report for yourself: [https://www.gvsu.edu/care/](https://www.gvsu.edu/care/) and get tools to help you. \n\nAlso, have you contacted Disability Support Resources? I am not implying that you have a disability, but perhaps they can assist with suggestions or accommodations to help you. \n\nThe Student Success Center is also offering webinars on time management: [https://www.gvsu.edu/sasc/module-events-view.htm?siteModuleId=0F2FDD3B-0F07-D15F-2AD43A8DF44972B0&amp;eventId=B2C900C2-C42A-B953-133F903A5BC70143](https://www.gvsu.edu/sasc/module-events-view.htm?siteModuleId=0F2FDD3B-0F07-D15F-2AD43A8DF44972B0&amp;eventId=B2C900C2-C42A-B953-133F903A5BC70143)\n\nTime Management Drop-In Hours: [https://www.gvsu.edu/sasc/module-events-view.htm?siteModuleId=0F2FDD3B-0F07-D15F-2AD43A8DF44972B0&amp;eventId=B3BA2BAF-0CFF-C71E-31E1331C2A300811](https://www.gvsu.edu/sasc/module-events-view.htm?siteModuleId=0F2FDD3B-0F07-D15F-2AD43A8DF44972B0&amp;eventId=B3BA2BAF-0CFF-C71E-31E1331C2A300811)\n\nFinally, for my students who are struggling, I recommend a bullet journal. Googling the terms will show you lots of fancy layouts but there are some simple ones that can help you with planning for classes. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrff3DErEEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrff3DErEEM)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hLnY9L1c-M&amp;t=209s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hLnY9L1c-M&amp;t=209s)\n\nI also agree that a large wall calendar is incredibly helpful. I have this set up for someone in my house who is doing online school and it is has dramatically approved their ability to remember to attend class and assignments.",

I am far from an expert in that field, but I\u2019ve been teaching long enough that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the problems you identify would be helped more by a professional.

Some professors usually send out announcements/emails of upcoming assignments that are due.\n\nI would write down on a piece of paper what needed to be done and color code each class. Throughout the week I would get a few tasks done until everything on the to-do list was complete. It honestly really helps. \n\nIf that's a no go then I recommend the app Any.do\nIt's like a to-do list, planner, and calendar all in one.

It forces me to look at it every time I open my phone or computer. Has worked for like 8 years.\n\nIf you don't think it would work for you you need to commit to it and just look at it. If you use keep you don't need anything else, just the one app. This is what the university reccomends us to do",

            "comment": "I have struggled with remembering what is due on which day, being caught by surprise when I show up to class and everyone has an assignment that I didn't even know about.\n\nThis is what works for me: Make a Google calendar with all of your classes. You can set it to repeat on certain days up until December at the end of the semester. This will at least help you to remember which classes you have each day. If you don't want to go through the trouble of setting up an online calendar, simply write out the days and classes on a piece of paper and keep it by your bed. If you have asynchronous classes, find a time when you usually have free and schedule yourself to work on that class at that time.\n\nEach day, when you have free study time, look at the list of classes you have tomorrow. Check that class's syllabus or Blackboard and make sure of what is expected due tomorrow. I made a Google Drive folder with all my classes's syllabi in it and linked it to my bookmarks bar on Google Chrome, but you could just as well print your syllabi out and keep them in a folder or drawer or check each one online, depending on what works for you. You can check one class at a time and work through all the due material for that class before checking the next one, or check all of them and make a list and then work through in whatever order you like. On Fridays, check Monday's schedule and do the work so that you will have no worries or obligations for the weekend. If there are any assignments for a class that will take more than a day to work on, make sure that you make note of those assignments (on your Google calendar or paper class list) along with the due date and work on these when you have time. Some people might say this method of \"one day at a time\" is not the best study technique, but it has worked well for me as someone who forgets due dates a lot.\n\nAs others have said, it might be worth it to look into talking to a therapist or doctor. You may benefit from a study drug like Adderall or even just from a licensed professional helping you to discover your weak points in studying and developing a plan that works for you. Ultimately, what works for other people will not always work for you, and I sense that that is some of your frustration in writing this post. [Grand Valley offers counseling](https://www.gvsu.edu/counsel/)  and I have several friends who have used it and had positive experiences.\n\nI sincerely wish you good luck in finding a strategy that works for you. Don't give up.",

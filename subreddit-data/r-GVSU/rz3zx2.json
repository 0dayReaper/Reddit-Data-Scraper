Wearing masks on campus isn\u2019t preventing people from being sick when there is absolutely no social distancing or regular appropriate sanitation happening. Not only that but even if we don\u2019t get sick we can carry the virus back to our families and the school board just doesn\u2019t seem to care.",

            "comment": "I clocked this back in Fall 2020, but the reality is imo, the GV Board prioritizes income and bottom dollar over the benefit of the student body. They obviously care, to an extent, however notice how despite going completely online Fall 2020, they hiked tuition prices by a considerable amount. Furthermore, especially now when COVID\u2019s spread has been the worst it\u2019s ever been, their justification for staying in-person is \u201cthe student body wants it\u201d, which really translates to \u201cwe want as much money as possible until it\u2019s a must to go online\u201d.\n\nNow it\u2019s true that GV\u2019s vaccination rate is high, yes, and even recently on campus there hasn\u2019t been many cases. However, the data currently is skewed given not many students have been on campus since break, and also even amongst the vaccinated, Omicron can spread very easily. Furthermore, GV is primarily a commuter school, and when you have a lot of your student body coming from places like Kent County with a very high positivity rate, you\u2019re looking at a mosh pit of COVID until they take action.",

I do understand that all students have different styles of learning that work for them, however,  students can get extra help from professors via video conference. There are many tools you can use to succeed in your classes. There is only so much that can be done to prevent the spread of COVID in our community and I hate to say it but the school is not doing a good enough job. If they aren\u2019t willing to do remote learning, they need to at least give concerned students the chance to complete their classes online. We shouldn\u2019t have to skip a semester and delay your education when remote learning has been proven to be successful. Personally, I don\u2019t think risking the lives of students and staff is worth it to be in-person with COVID cases on the rise.",

But to say that staying open is risking the lives of students and faulty is a little hyperbolic.

I and plenty of other students wouldn\u2019t be able to handle another year of online classes, they require plenty more work and you get half of the experience.",

If you don't want to catch COVID at GV you shouldn't force the school to have online classes. Plenty of students like me need in person classes to learn at their fullest potential. You guys could always just drop a semester if you're so worried about getting COVID.",

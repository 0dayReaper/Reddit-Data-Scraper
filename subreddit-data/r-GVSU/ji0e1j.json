    "postText": "I wasn\u2019t sure if anyone here was aware, I live in an off campus apartment very close to GV and it looks like someone taped flyers to doors asking to sign a petition for any sort of mental health break at all during the second semester, seeing as we\u2019ll have 15 weeks non stop of work. Regardless of your stance, I\u2019ll post the link to the petition.\n\nhttps://www.change.org/GV_MentalHealthBreak",

            "comment": "Does anybody know who sees these petitions once they are signed? I can't speak for all faculty, but I'm pretty sure the Faculty Senate would be pretty interested in seeing this petition -- especially the (IMO) really alarming comment section that goes with it. \n\nThere may not end up being any sort of formal break in Winter 2021, but individual faculty can definitely create one in their schedules if they wanted. Prior to the institution of a Fall Break in 2019, we faculty (at least in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences) were encouraged to give students a \"fall breather\" --- basically a cease-fire on exams and homework during Monday-Wednesday of week 8 of the semester. So there's a tradition of creating breaks where there may not be any in the official calendar. If faculty were fully aware of just how bad it's getting for students I think it would be an easy sell to try such a thing next semester. I know I'm already doing so after reading that petition.",

We are making a lot of progress in terms of the exposure and support the petition is receiving. Although this petition highlights student needs, I genuinely recognize the similar stress faculty are under so I think a Winter 2021 break would serve the whole GVSU community. This point was made in the meeting I had with the Student Senate president. If you could share it with your fellow faculty members, that would be greatly appreciated.",

Monday off this week, Tuesday off two weeks from now, Wednesday in four weeks... that sort of thing.\n\nI totally understand that this won't feel the same as having an entire week away from stress, but this one day breaks could give extra time for homework or other activities without encouraging travel",

Scattered breaks are another option being discussed for that reason and is the most likely change the university is going to be willing to offer. However, if we were to have a Spring Break, there are ways to combat the threat of spreading Covid with a 2-week isolation period. All of this is included in the petition so I encourage you to read it or message me if you\u2019d like more information.",

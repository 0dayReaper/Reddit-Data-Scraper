I would not consider myself someone who lives for parties as I\u2019m pretty studious, however I still am pretty outgoing. Also, how are the bars downtown? I do have a fake ID so I am just curious on how strict they are down at GR and if freshman ever even go to bars?",

You're better off just getting together with some friends and having a small kickback. I wasn't a huge partier either but would occasionally go to one with friends and we never stuck around super long, they're just boring at GV. If you want to go to a \"real\" party you'd probably have to drive south to WMU or out to Lansing for MSU and at that point you just have to ask yourself if it's really worth the drive lol.",

As long as you're not being overtly obnoxious or creating problems you'll be totally fine. My friends would come over and we'd have a couple drinks at my place. They'll do room checks like maybe twice a year but that's about it and if they see anything you're not supposed to have (unless you just have like booze if you're under 21 or weed) just laying around they're not going to care if you have a candle or other stuff you're technically not supposed to have.",

You'll probably meet a few people going in who will have the hookup for that sort of thing. Also probably shouldn't be advertising that you have a fake ID on the GV subreddit.",

These are the parties where the hosts will find their possessions stolen, the cops are guaranteed to pull up, and a crowd of random people will be outside their doorstep at all times. \n\nIronically enough, the best parties at GV are at just a few of the campus\u2019 frats. They\u2019re not necessarily buck wild like the frat parties at MSU or western, but religiously check who they let through their door as GV looks for any opportunity to shut them down for good (pres is proudly anti-Greek)\n\nAllendale just isn\u2019t as safe as it was four years ago. Kids from the local area, GR, and Kzoo will drive up looking to find something to destroy. \n\nI will say, GV has an amazing darty scene on Saturdays. These were some of my favorite memories from undergrad. \n\nHope this helps. Stay safe and if it\u2019s something that piques your interest rush a good frat or campus organization. It\u2019s the best way to make friends with similar interests if you find that your neighbors aren\u2019t such the type",

My freshman year was a constant party and was one of the most fun years of my life. \n\nFreshman year you\u2019ll probably spend a lot of time smoking and drinking in the dorms if you or a friend has a cool RA (mine was very chill). If you make some older friends then you can party off campus as well. Remember: if the cops come and claim they smell weed or whatever, **don\u2019t let them in without a warrant.** Even for a dorm room, they still need one. This saved our ass plenty of times. Send the most sober person to crack the door open, slip out into the hallway and close it behind them. They might grandstand for a while but they can\u2019t really do shit. Have everyone stay in the room for a while and preferably don\u2019t let them leave with weed or booze cuz the cops will sometimes hang out near the dorm entrances after they fail to enter the room. \n\nOnce you move off campus it will be a lot easier to have bigger and louder parties. \n\nThere used to be a bar in Meadows called Mullys that was real lax with underaged drinking, but they shut down a few years ago. Other than that look forward to apartment parties until you\u2019re of age.\n\nIn all honesty though, it is true that MSU has better parties. My experience with GV is that it had a big drug (psychedelics mostly) scene - the on campus forest is truly beautiful and makes for a great place to experiment in. \n\nStay safe, keep up with your classes and have fun :)",

    "postText": "Does anyone have experience with Kensington locks at GVSU? I want to leave my laptop at my table, study room, etc. to use the restroom or get a drink and not have to pack my stuff up (and risk someone taking my study room since I'm not there). I know Kensington locks don't protect against theft, but just prevent it. Anyone ever have a laptop stolen? Think a Kensington lock would prevent it at least? Any input would be appreciated! Thanks!",

Someone in my dorm stole a laptop and was expelled in days. Back in 2014 if that matters. It was out of a person's room and there werent cameras afaik \n\nI'm assuming you're in the library, and I'm very sure there's cameras there but I know there's vacant study rooms in all the halls this semester so it might depend where your room is",

I would recommend this laptop lock cable as it works in your audio port (most laptops dont have a Kensington slot): [https://store.multplx.com/collections/laptops/products/laptop-security-anchor?variant=31844409442415](https://store.multplx.com/collections/laptops/products/laptop-security-anchor?variant=31844409442415) I use this and it works great.",

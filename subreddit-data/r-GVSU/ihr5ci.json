Faculty have trained for this eventuality and are ready to offer an engaging experience I encourage you to give this new modality a chance before considering any changes to your schedule.\u201d",

Faculty hoped all summer admin would bring safe procedures and protections, but were told on the past several meetings just how woefully underprepared admin is - no required test before coming back to campus, horrendous self-assessment process, not enough PPE in offices or for classrooms, not enough weekly testing, not enough quarantine beds, and no support for off-camous students. Just now has administration agreed to allow faculty safety to teach online, as a half measure to ignore their vote to go fully online except for applied programs like nursing and PT that absolutely can't get licensed without sims and clinicals. I'm in Political Science and my classes are face to face. Like what?!? Why do I need to be in the classroom to learn that?",

So when the schedule was redone in June and July, there was a belief that not all of those courses could be put totally online. \n\nBut it's not true that faculty weren't consulted at all about moving courses to online. Faculty were surveyed back in June, during the restructuring of the schedule, and were asked whether they wanted their courses fully online. Any request to put one's courses fully online for medical or personal reasons was, AFAIK, automatically approved and this approval worked on the honor system (e.g. if you told your department chair you were in a high-risk medical category, nobody, that was taken as fact without followup). I was serving as Math Department chair at the time and coordinated these consultations. \n\nI also wouldn't say that we faculty were \"forced\" to be F2F or hybrid. What's closer to the truth is that there was a sense that while you could ask to teach fully online, some percentage of courses were *not* going to be made online under any circumstance (short of a full campus shutdown) and so some faculty were going to need to teach those courses. That's why I chose to keep my classes hybrid; I would prefer to teach online, but I had no medical or personal reason to do so, and so I decided I'd step up and teach the hybrid courses that needed to be taught with F2F meetings. \n\nSo I appreciate the benefit of the doubt given to faculty, but this was my choice and not something forced on me.",

It is administrative manipulation into thinking you had a choice and decided to step up.  You didn't really have a choice here. And in your situation, doubly so. Your dean is telling you x% of 100 and 200-level courses MUST be f2f, but your faculty want to teach online, so what do you do? You be the martyr so you don't have to \"force\" someone else to do it. That's basically your dean forcing you to do it. It is injust and unsafe.",

I get people wanting classes to be online so they can stay safe, but its not fair to us who are willing to take the risk and feel in person learning works better for us.  What pisses me off greatly is the lack of information. Its like they intentionally mislead us students to get our tuition money.",

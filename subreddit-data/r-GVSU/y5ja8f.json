If they do, and you don\u2019t get an interview, then that would also be a good indicator of your results.\n\nI\u2019d say talk to your counselor or one from the College of Health Professions to see why. You might be able to shoot them an email with your question.",

The PT and Sonography programs include an interview alongside the admission and acceptance process, and from what I\u2019ve heard from past students is that if you don\u2019t get an interview for those programs, then you were not in the final batch of students that were considered to be accepted.\n\nHowever, it sounds like someone in the MPA or a graduate from the MPA program commented so I would get in touch with them and ask them more detailed questions of the process and what they did to get in.",

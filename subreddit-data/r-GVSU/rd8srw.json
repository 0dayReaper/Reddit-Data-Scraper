            "comment": "From the mother of the young man who died by suicide:\n\nTo the Grand Valley Community: that was MY son that jumped off that bridge less than 48 hours ago. Our local police showed up at our home at 2am to tell me my son was dead. Our world has shattered. My face is raw from tears that won\u2019t stop. His Dad has crumbled. And his little sister \u2013 who has the same birthday as him \u2013 wails with a pain that rips my heart apart over and over again. Two weeks ago he was home for Thanksgiving. We played euchre and laughed at how bad I am at the game. We took his car in to the shop to put brand new tires on it and fix other issues to make sure the car was safe for his 2+ hour drive back to GVSU. There are presents wrapped under the tree for him. And there is an order on the way for clothing with his fraternity logo on it \u2013 a box I don\u2019t want to arrive at my door, a box that will bring me to my knees when I see it sitting on my porch waiting for me to open it.\r  \nI thought everything was good. He said he was having the time of his life. He had a best friend he loved, the best friendship he\u2019s ever had. He joined a fraternity and was talking about the event he was planning to help organize. But\u2026he was suffering from depression. And instead of talking about it \u2013 to ANYONE \u2013 he chose to end his life in a horrific way. Our family will never be the same. I have no idea how we are going to go on. The pain we are suffering is unbearable, unimaginable.\r  \nStudents, if you are dealing with depression, PLEASE get help. Talk to your parents. If you can\u2019t talk to them, talk to a teacher, someone from your religious community, call a helpline, hell \u2013 call ME. I will talk to you. I would do ANYTHING to prevent another family from going thru this nightmare. But GET HELP. Please. Do it for your family. Do it for my son. Please don\u2019t let his death be in vain.\r  \nTo any of my son\u2019s friends: I want to hear from you. I want to hear stories about my son. I want to know how much he meant to you. I want to hear stories about how silly he was, I want to hear stories that will make me laugh instead of cry and remind me of how wonderful he was. I don\u2019t need space. I need contact from you. I need to know he was loved. Please share this message \u2013 I know most of you aren\u2019t on FB. Please copy and paste and share. You can text me, or call me or email me: 734-776-4029 / tamicamp@yahoo.com\r  \nHe turned 19 on Thanksgiving. He was a freshman. He was my world.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/hnKuA2T](https://imgur.com/a/hnKuA2T)",

Our first responsibility is always to the families involved in tragic circumstances. President Mantella and the Dean of Students office have spoken to Quinn\u2019s mother to ask how best to support the family at this moment. They have asked that we share his visitation and funeral information: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/quentin-campbell-obituary?id=31845109&amp;fbclid=IwAR0mGjtwlM9_rGsNe3n1FcywkEwnritGqui2vkzs5VzVAhqE9q8Ns3ocQH4\n\nThey want to invite anyone who knew and loved Quinn to attend. Students who wish to go to the visitation on Friday, but have a conflict with finals, are asked to reach out to the Dean of Students Office.\n\nThe Dean of Students Office, University Counseling, Office of Student Life, and Housing and Residence Life continue to work with students impacted. If you or anyone you know is struggling, please reach out by submitting a care referral at https://www.gvsu.edu/care/. \n\nSelf care and support is important during this difficult time. Resources are available at University Counseling https://www.gvsu.edu/counsel/.",

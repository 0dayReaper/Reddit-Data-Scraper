            "comment": "Seems like another good idea that wasn't well executed. Those hours really aren't helpful. I remember when I first tried to succeed at GV I was working 3rd shift at Amazon just so I could work and go to classes. In between classes I walked around MAK as much as possible to stay awake, and one time some lakers recognized me at a concert because of it. \n\nI know they won't, but they really gotta get away from bankers hours for some of this stuff. Esp since they target adults a lot, but if you don't have a cushy job or amazing work conditions none of their resources are reasonable, including this.",

            "comment": "I love that the hours they choose to do these events are right when the thick of classes/work hours are. If they genuinely cared about students well-being and mental health, shouldn\u2019t they offer services that could be offered between like 5pm-7pm? Something that goes later than the majority of classes. I know it won\u2019t be perfect for everyone, but at least a greater majority would have the option?",

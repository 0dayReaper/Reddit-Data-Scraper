    "postText": "I'm Zack Goodrow, EIC of the Lanthorn and I'm working on an article about GVSU and parking services. I've received FOIA information from the university regarding parking on Allendale's campus. 1). GVSU has the most expensive parking in the state. 2). Since March 3, GVSU has made about $4.5 million from students for parking. 3). Lot J passes have increased by 90% since 2015 and commuter passes have increased by 26.5%. \n\nI have a survey that would greatly benefit this article if some fellow GVSU students filled it out. It just has some basic questions regarding if you've ever received a ticket, how often you drive to campus, ect. If you take the time to fill this out it would be greatly appreciated and provide more context about GVSU parking prices. Here's the link: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8PyPuKIsLp\\_NshLNjVqR82sd8sTIJJU1GmvPZug-8xnd8wg/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8PyPuKIsLp_NshLNjVqR82sd8sTIJJU1GmvPZug-8xnd8wg/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\nThank you.",

This will definitely help this story.  \n\nI've seen a lot of responses regarding how packed lots can be and that's one of the main reasons people are receiving tickets. From the FOIA, this semester GVSU has sold over 9,000 parking permits for Allendale's campus. According to parking services, there's only 7,400 parking spaces on campus. Not sure where there fits into the story, but if it doesn't make it in, I just wanted to let you all know why this is such an issue.",

Without students around you and a professor in person, I found myself drifting away from the class mentally. \n    \nIt's much harder to ask questions and recieve answers in an online format. Without meeting in person with a professor, how often limited to emailing them, which brings it's own problems. Serious questions can be very hard to word properly in an email, and if you can't explain precisely what's tripping you up, you can't get the answer you're looking for. \n    \nIt was difficult for me to keep any semblance of a schedule. Without the added help of actual physical classes, deadlines lost a lot of weight. I turned so many assignments in late during online. \n  \nCurriculum often had to be scaled back in order to avoid overwhelming students. Many assignments were cut short or removed entirely. While this did help with some of the stress, it also meant I received a severely diminished education without any compensation for the change. \n   \nOf my five classes, only one switched to a  digital classroom format. The other four assigned work and readings through email and blackboard with hardly any real communication.  My class lectures and discussions were replaced with a chapter from a book. The discussions really help to nail down understanding of a topic, and without that, I never really felt like I grasped a lot of what I had to read. \n  \n\n  Online tests are terrible. Blackboard simply doesn't have the capacity to handle all the traffic that test-taking through it on a massive scale brings. I was taking a final exam online, and when I went to turn it in, blackboard froze up on me and would not proceed. It forced me to reload the page, and when I did, a few of my answers (including an 800 word essay) were gone with ten minutes until the test was due. Luckily my professor extended the deadline an hour or so for me, but if he hadn't been understating I would have lost 25% on my grade due to a system error entirely out of my control.\n  \n\nI'm not sure how much this helps you. I thought I would share my struggle with online leaning. If you have any other questions about the learning from a student perspective, I'd be happy to answer them.",

The class already suffered from disorganization, terrible verbal and written communication and instruction. With most of the class not knowing what the hell was going on. I'm not exaggerating in the least. Multiple times per class most of us would be gasping or laughing in astonishment from what the instructor did, said, contradicted or expected. Take all that, move it online, and it compounds the issue. The ONLY advantage was the prof taped videos which could be paused, watched, and re-watched for understanding. He only did so with another more \"technologically savvy\" prof pressing record. This prof had never taught an online class in his 25+ years at GVSU. I'm pretty sure he never left campus to get a look at the real world either - at least in my opinion.   \n\n\nIf you want effective online learning, It needs to be on par with a Coursera type platform, highly organized, with clear expectations, deadlines, and course materials. Motivation will still lack with remote learning. I think eventually we'll learn, as with productivity and remote work, we need to have the flexibility to choose how we learn and study. That could mean both online and offline learning for the same class.   \n\n\nI took a hybrid last summer and liked it. Cut down on in class time but supplemented with online materials. Then again, the instructor was effective and would have been either way.",

I was taking CHM 109 this semester for a gen ed, and I was really struggling with the subject matter before everything hit the fan. I was managing the best I could by going to her office hours and I also had a support group of friends that could help me whenever I needed it. Needless to say, it all fell apart due to conflicting time zones and tbh a lack of motivation on my part. \n\nMy professor had decided to not continue with our 3 times a week lecture, but rather post the normal note guide she posts and told us to look for the answers in our textbooks. That\u2019s it. After the first few weeks, I emailed her telling her that her method wasn\u2019t working and I didn\u2019t understand why she cut the lecture out, but still expected us to complete the regular workload. Her reasoning was that since the class was so large (~130 people lecture) that it wasn\u2019t possible for her to do. After this point, I switched the class to credit/no credit since I couldn\u2019t believe I was being left out to dry like this. I could go on forever about that class, but i did everything I had to to get a passing grade and I never wanna talk about chemistry again and I\u2019d rather just list my suggestions. \n\nLet me just say that some people just don\u2019t learn well online / some topics just can\u2019t be taught online as well as others. \n\n1. If classes have a lecture component, professors should be required to post them to blackboard, private google drive, or YouTube (I still don\u2019t get why my prof didn\u2019t do this if blackboard\u2019s system couldn\u2019t accommodate 130 people in one session). Students should not be accountable for teaching themselves a large portion of the material - that\u2019s why we need professors. \n\n2. Like somebody said earlier, break up what is expected to be learned into digestible deadlines. Make learning objectives clear\n\n3. Hold professors accountable. I know this whole situation is really difficult for you guys too, but straight up not teaching is inexcusable. \n\n4. This is more for GV administrators rather than professors, but for the love of god keep email spam to a minimum. I had to block multiple RA\u2019s because they were filling up my email with useless things. I missed multiple emails from professors because Housing was telling me to leave when I had an exemption or campus dining telling me for the third time that hours would be restricted for those on campus. \n\n5. Handle homework assigning and submitting through blackboard. Having professors not use blackboard normally is unnecessarily stressful, but in order to teach online blackboard is a tool that needs to be utilized instead of funneling a million .docx files through email. Also, students can see what they have and haven\u2019t submitted and don\u2019t have to dig around in their sent emails to see if everything is in. \n\n6. Not sure how applicable this is to the math department, but one thing one of my history professors did was cancel our big 10 page research project since we couldn\u2019t get to the library and check out what we needed to do research. I\u2019m happy she did this because I heard plenty of stories from people from other universities were there were plenty of professors who were not as understanding as mine was. \n\n7. Lastly, it\u2019s very easy to tell when professors are purely assigning busy work and should be kept to a minimum. \n\nThank you again for being open to our criticisms of the university and our professors.

You take the time upfront to create crafted lessons, lectures, materials and other artifacts. Once done, hundreds to thousands to hell, even millions of students can take them. The teacher's role then becomes (after content creation), the role of mentor, facilitator, coach, etc. \n\nRather than, hey, take my shoddy notes and without having the lectures you had before, perform at the same level, you learn at your own pace (to some extent) with quality materials. \n\nI encourage everyone to rate their professors so the rest of us can be aware of them.",

If there's somebody in a class without access to the tech needed to participate in a synchronous discussion (which is a LOT of our students, we found out this semester) then real-time discussions are non-starters. Same is true if students schedules that conflict with synchronous meetings (a lot more common now with so many out of work). \n\nA workaround i've used in my classes is something like Slack or CampusWire (https://campuswire.com/) to carry on discussions that are like chat rooms -- asynchronous but fairly free-flowing.",

There's more value in the physicality of a public four-year than just the living quarters, so to not have refunded more than just housing is another indicator that universities are willingly overcharging for the second-rate experience of attending remotely, for however long that may last. But most are still charging the first-rate tuition and fees as if students were or will be parading around campus, soaking in all the sunshine",

Also my space is very small and limited and I personally like to be relaxed in what little semblance of a home I have, so doing school work was almost not an option.\n\nAdditionally- I live in a pretty not great environment. Being able to escape to classes and the library was the only thing keeping me afloat. Being trapped at home with 17 credits suddenly moved online, a crazy amount of emails from faculty and administrators, and teachers changing things everyday- I mostly gave up, which was completely heartbreaking since it was supposed to be my last semester and I couldn't financially afford to come back. At least 4 mental breakdowns later, I've graduated, but online is not a viable option for everyone.\n\nI know this semester was sudden and unpredictable, but if things are going to continue online, there needs to be changes. Firstly, teachers need to unify and have time to adapt their content to online. The policies for each class were all over the board. And there needs to be an addressment of what students are going through. It took way too long for the administrative services to move online, and even then, it felt like they were unattainable. And financials need to be addressed too. I know GRCC has waived their tuition fees, so maybe something similar? GV usually charges more for online class with \"service\" fees, so will those be waived? With limited work and high unemployment, students might not be able to even afford to come back.\n\nI hope over the summer they figure everything out for a comprehensive system. But I'm so lucky that I graduated and I'm out. Good luck everyone.",

As a faculty member, I can't remember the a year where my Fall schedule didn't change!\n\nAlso, GVSU has never had this situation before, which means there was not a ready-made, automated and efficient way to make the huge number of changes that had to be made. There are bound to be typos and oversights that will be corrected as they are found",

    "postText": "Ok so I didn't know exactly where to post this question but I want to major in art with a focus on illustration and in struggling between Wayne state and gvsu. At first I was thinking gvsu was the route to go since I got a full ride but just today I saw that I had a full ride for Wayne state as well. Gvsu is too far for me to your before decision day and I'm touring Wayne State tomorrow but not touring gvsu makes me wonder if I'm making the right decision if I do go to Wayne state  ( it's my bad for not applying earlier and planning a tour originally I didn't think college was gonna happen). \n\nSo my questions are \n\n1. Which college has the better art program?\n2. Which campus is less racist/more friendly towards people of color?\n3. Which college has the better student life? \n4. Which college provides better education\n5. Which college campus is nicer?\n6. What was your experience at either college?",

            "comment": "I'd recommend GVSU overall, obviously it's all dependent on what you want as an individual for people of color it's fantastic.\n\nIf this is my cousin, shoutout Kasina, the Native American program here is fantastic and has been a huge help with reconnecting to Indigenous Culture in Western Michigan but also a great support. Questions I'd have been left in the dust if I didn't have Lin Bardwell's support on have been answered (Lin's the Native American Advisor for GVSU.)! \n\nRacism is rampant in Western Michigan, but in the bigger cities you'll be fine. \n\nAt the end of the day, what you make of GVSU is what you'll get out of it. Go to clubs, just walk around, do things with your life that you won't regret! College is what ya pour into it, but I love Grand Rapids, GVSUs proximity to it, and just the campus and people overall. I'd recommend GV heavily",

            "comment": "Can only speak for GVSU (I\u2019m a freshman) but not an art major\n\n2. I\u2019m a POC. GVSU overall is not that diverse. That\u2019s not to say that you won\u2019t see minorities walking around everyday cause you do but in classes it\u2019s not as diverse. I haven\u2019t had any experiences of racism this far but I know my friends had an incident that hasn\u2019t been resolved yet. Join the cultural clubs! Also, I\u2019m not sure of your background but there\u2019s freshmen orientations for minorities like asians, blacks, etc. as well which seem quite helpful to find other minorities \n\n3. Allendale is basically in the middle of nowhere but you can join student orgs which are VITAL for a college experience. There\u2019s also quite a lot of events that you get emailed to you so you don\u2019t really miss out on anything. There\u2019s also always flyers around in the academic halls. There\u2019s also a bus you can take downtown and see a lot more things like restaurants and ice skating. \n\n4. So far, I\u2019m happy with the education I\u2019m receiving. If you do gen eds, those could add a lot of credits to your schedule if you don\u2019t have ap credits, dual enrollment, or enrolled in the honors college (i can answer honors questions if you have any). But overall it\u2019s quite well-rounded it seems.\n\n5. GVSU looks very new and it\u2019s pretty obvious. The freshmen housing is VERY nice compared to many other dorms and there\u2019s even community lounges with kitchens to hang out in. \n\n6. Overall I\u2019m happy with my experience at GV rn, they have a good reputation and I actually learn in my classes, and I\u2019m getting the experiences that I was curious about in hs.",

            "comment": "Have you had a chance to go to both campuses and meet faculty and students? \nI know an official tour is not always the complete picture, but it\u2019s better than the photos/videos you see online. \nMeeting the professors at GV and actually seeing it were two big factors in me choosing it over WMU (WMU\u2019s campus is terribly laid out and just looks dumpy and depressing all the time). I attended for music education.\n\nMy experiences\u2026\n\nBecause GV is a newer school their on campus dorms are a lot nicer and come in more variety than in any other college I\u2019ve seen in the state. Additionally, off campus housing is so close (main campus) that you can walk to them easily or wait for the free bus.\n\nAt GV the art building is named after the artist Calder, and there are actually dorms attached to the art building if you want to be right there. That building is also close to two buildings that have food (Connection, Kirkhof) and the Performing Arts Center that houses an art gallery.\n\nThe campus at GV is a good size. You can get to your classes on time because the layout isn\u2019t an odd shape or too large. \n\nFree bus system means you can get across campus, to an off campus dorm, to Meijer, or even all the way downtown for free! This was a huge plus for me because I didn\u2019t have a car until the end of my college career. \n\nThere is a variety of food options at the on campus dining halls where you can use your meal plan/pre loaded meal money, or a credit card. There are also convenience stores in some of the food buildings just in case you need something.",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t think I was ever in the art building at Wayne, but GVSU has significantly nicer UNDERGRAD facilities than Wayne state. Wayne states grad facilities (program dependent) are actually really nice and kept up. \n\nIf I was going to undergrad I would 100% choose GVSU. \n\nIn terms of social aspect they are completely different. Wayne state is technically a commuter school but the location is in Detroit which made it more fun for me. GVSU\u2019s social life is pretty boring, I\u2019m sure some people disagree with me but overall I would prefer my social setting to be at Wayne since there\u2019s more to do in the area overall. \n\nGood luck!\n\n\nEdit:\nAlso Wayne state was more diverse in my opinion. A lot more international students from my experience.",

            "comment": "Not sure where you're from but being from southeast Michigan, West Michigan has a lot to offer when it comes to outdoors and recreation in general. There are a lot of trails, parks, and lake Michigan is beautiful. 25 minutes one direction at GVSU and you're at the lake on a beach, 25 minutes the other way you're in big city grand rapids. These are not things that I heavily considered when I was choosing, but ultimately made a huge difference. Wayne will obviously be a lot more Urban, so it's personal preference. Also important to note, GVSU has the second largest art collection in Michigan (next to the DIA). You can't find a place on campus that doesn't have some form of artwork. I know these don't really answer your questions but are other considerations to factor in. Depending on your personality, GV's campus might be more enjoyable for you. I personally love the campus, and it's beautiful, at least as much as a Midwestern campus can be.",

Cars thinking they can go through the red since it's a one way... The list goes on. Oh and not to forget phones....",

Flipped the red car up on its side so they had to flip it back and cut the top open. I couldn't say which car was which/at fault in the incident. \n\nThere's always a lot of responders that come to scenes around the campus. Never less than 6 responders come when anything happens here (at the apartments)",

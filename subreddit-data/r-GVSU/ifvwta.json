    "postText": "back in june, GVSU decided they were raising tuition prices by 3%. i don\u2019t understand why or how this is necessary, especially because most classes are online. this is less of a complaint and more of a question. i\u2019m confused. where is that money going? \n\ni\u2019ve heard a few people say they\u2019re using the money to improve online learning, but that doesn\u2019t sit right with me... if all classes are online, i feel like the uni will spend a lot less money on building up-keep, utilities, etc. \n\nmaybe i\u2019m just naive, but if anyone has some input i\u2019d appreciate it!",

It\u2019s not going to professor salaries (frozen) or adjuncts (many were fired). Also - buildings still need to be looked after (and mortgages paid) even if people aren\u2019t actively using them. https://www.gvsu.edu/gvnext/2020/gvsu-boosts-financial-aid-by-13-plans-for-fall.htm",

So revenue is probably going to be down despite an increase in tuition. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the university has been struggling with ratcheting down their budget for the past few years. The administration is probably going to use the pandemic as an opportunity to \"over-correct\" and maximize the cuts they make while they can point to a solid reason.",

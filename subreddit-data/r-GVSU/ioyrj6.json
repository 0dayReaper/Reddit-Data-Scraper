    "postText": "So I was selected to be randomly tested, and I wanted to share my experience with you all. Below, I pasted the email I just sent out to the president and the virus action team. **At this point, if you are selected to be randomly tested, I would refuse.** The way the program is set up is just not safe. \n\n\n\u201cHello, \n\nI was randomly selected to be tested for COVID-19 early last week, and I scheduled my appointment for Wednesday, September 2nd at 11:15 a.m.\n\nI arrived at the fieldhouse at 11:00 a.m. and was screened at the door. I was directed to an extraordinarily long line down the stairs. In the queue, not a single person was an adequate distance apart. A student worker was hurriedly trying to place tape X marks on the floor at proper social distance, but in doing so was shifting the line so students came into even closer contact with one another. \n\nI waited in the testing line for a prolonged period (half an hour, by this time it was 11:30). To enter into the basketball courts where tests were being conducted, I had to open a door - the handle on the door was clearly not being sanitized, and had been touched by what I'm sure was hundreds of people both before and after me. \n\nAfter entering the gym, I had to wait in another line, where again, no one was adequately social distancing. I waited for about 10 minutes (by this time it was 11:40, ten minutes after my appointment should have been completed). When I arrived at the front of the line, the Spectrum screeners were in a line formation facing the door, set up with computers. None of the Spectrum employees were socially distant. For obvious reasons, this is problematic, but doubly so because everyone in my vicinity could hear my address, telephone number, insurance, and other personal information. \n\nAfter my screening with the Spectrum employee (standing close to both them, the other workers, and everyone in the gym being tested) I had to walk through the line of computers (again, in close contact with everyone) to have my test administered. \n\nThe test itself was rapid, but in all, my volunteering to participate in this randomized testing program cost me an hour of my time, as opposed to the estimated 15 minutes. More importantly, my participation in this program could have cost me my health, as I was more than likely exposed during a test which I volunteered to take. \n\nFrom my experience it is abundantly clear that Grand Valley State University is woefully underprepared to test such a high volume of students. I am deeply disappointed in the work of the Virus Action Team, but more so the administration as a whole.\n\nThis poorly cobbled-together \"testing\" protocol is shameful and I feel it is my duty as a student to express my disappointment, and urge the administration to make positive changes and improve the testing protocol. Even at the pleading of faculty members, the administration refused to move classes entirely online - you are obligated to keep this community safe, and you are doing a shameful job of it.\u201d",

And let me tell you the fuckin hoops I had to jump through.\n\nYesterday: my idiocy, got an email from a rep from the Dean of Students, I skimmed over it and regurgitating details on what to do, look out for, blegh. I thought it was the usual \"cover my ass because not enough info was out there\" but LO AND BEHOLD third sentence in, \"you should've been contacted by a nurse seeing regarding your test results\"\n\nToday: email from prof, \"got a notice from the Dean of Students you were supposed to isolate and quarentine today, what gives?\"\n\nCUE RECORD SCRATCH\n\ni hadn't received any info where to access my results and when I would get them, two calls later netted me a, \"INCONCLUSIVE\" result. Perfect. Three more calls netted me a, \"we'll call you tomorrow with more details, maybe getting you another test\"\n\nSo not only did I not know my results were in, I wasn't contacted in ways that I feel are more personal or professional. I had to find out the MyChart login from a spectrum rep. Come the fuck on.\n\nTldr; missed details on an email leads me to find out my inconclusive results leading to self isolation. Should be fun as fuck.",

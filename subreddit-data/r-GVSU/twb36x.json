I do not want to transfer somewhere and have it impossible for me to meet new people. What do you guys suggest?",

            "comment": "Will you be living on campus? \n\nI transferred to GVSU as an adult student who commuted and lived off campus, and I found it hard to make friends. The campus is quite spread out, and if you're not in the same area for many of your classes it will take effort to meet people.\n\nWherever you go, it helps to get yourself out and wander campus a bit, to see new places and faces.\nI found that creating a routine outside of class made meeting people easier, because you are likely to see the same person more than once. Practices like regularly visiting the Makerspace in the basement of the Idema Pew library to play, sitting in the same general area for lunch, walking the Arboretum, or studying in Seidman House or the Haas Performing Center gallery room will put you in contact with the people who also regularly do those things. Making eye contact, smiling, and saying hi to people who seem open really will start a relationship. I also suggest joining an interesting group, like the sustainable ag farm, the radio station, your major's groups or fraternity, and going to interesting lectures you see being put on.\n\nAs long as you put yourself in areas where the people are, you will meet them. The study abroad office is a nice place to just look around at their materials and talk to people. Whatever traits or interests you have, there is a group for you at GVSU, it will just take some time to find it. Start looking now. If you can afford the time, maybe try to find an internship or job on campus, just to meet people. If you find a teacher you like, stay after and talk to them, and other students will too. Don't sleep on your classmates either - they are who you should be networking with for future career prospects. Get your LinkedIn ready if it's applicable to your intended job and start adding the people you meet. \nGood luck, you got this :-)",

            "comment": "Being an upperclassman transfer  to GSVU myself, it\u2019s hard naturally to meet new people as most of groups are cemented. My experience was complicated due to coming admist covid. I made friends with neighbors, student groups, and classmates.  Diving into social things makes it easier to get along.  I well say far as meeting new people MSU hands down. MSU is more diverse than GVSU so they are at an advantage immediately. MSU also has a larger student population, larger city (depending if you\u2019ll be in Allendale or Grand Rapids), and more campus life. I live in Grand Rapids, but when I visit Allendale there is nothing really in walking distance (outside of whatever party going). East Lansing isn\u2019t large, but Albert street is across the street from campus and there is plenty to walk to nearby. \n\nTaking it beyond that, MSU is viewed more favorably than GVSU academically in most majors and the cost is around the same.\n\nUnless there is something about GVSU that gives it a leg up, I would suggest MSU without question.",

            "comment": "A lot of people have already touched on the topics I would speak on.  But here are some links to get some hard and fast details and impressions of campus life.  \n\n[Course Equivalency](https://www.gvsu.edu/studentapps/mtn/)  \nThis will give you an Idea of what your incoming course experience will transfer in as GVSU credit.  If you haven't yet, reach out to the registrars office about the nuts and bolts of getting your courses to count right and get info on classes youll have to take at GVSU.  There are some GenEd requirements that have to be taken at GVSU and you need a minimum amount of credit hours at GVSU to graduate.  Most Higher Ed Inst have this requirement.\n\n\n[Office of Student Life](https://www.gvsu.edu/studentlife/)\nThis gives a rundown of the social clubs on campus.  LakerLink is our event/org catalogue.  \n\n\n[Advising offices](https://www.gvsu.edu/advising/advising-centers-70.htm)\nThese folks are gonna be the Virgil to your Dante.  They have all the info you need acadmically speaking and can even offer further guidance on things out side of the class stuff.  Find the school that has your major of intrest and reach out to them\n\n\n\nHigher Ed climate overall doesn't do too well accommodating transfer students like they do traditional students.  GVSU being close to Grand Rapids (with a campus presence downtown) you may be set up better socially as GR isnt as much as a college town as Lansing is.    \n\n\nThis is all I feel is proper to say not knowing some more details (degree path, specific interest, home institution, etc), but feel free to shoot a msg if you have specific questions.  Below is a suggested list of action itesm\n\n\n\n*check out the course equivalency guide\n*check out the office of student life (OSL) and LakerLink sites\n*reach out to the registrars office about what youll need to get a GVSU degree with your current academic exp.\n*reach out to the advising office of your intended degree and set up a prospective student meeting    \n\n\nIm a transfer student too.  GVSU is my fifth institution, but I am getting my masters here.   I like the campus.  I like the school and I like Grand Rapids.  And Tacos el Cunado are the best tacos in town.  Tamales Mary has the best Tamales.",

I don\u2019t know any guys going to GVSU and I was hoping to get matched with someone kind of with the same interests. I\u2019m not sure how this is all supposed to happen, just thought there\u2019d be like a way to express who you are basically.",

GV mainly focuses on making sure study habits/smoking preference is observed. \n\nThat being said I didn't know anyone coming in and lived with 3 random guys who didn't have similar interests as me, wasn't an awful experience because I learned how to deal with people like that and the next year I moved in with friends I made. \n\nI would look into the Facebook page for your year or some other social media to find a roommate if you want someone with similar interests.",

They won't ticket or anything for that and no pass is required.  That's most likely the closest you can get\n\nOtherwise as others have said, Meijer in Standale and bus in, or Aldi whichever you prefer.  You may also find a spot to park along the 37 Bus Route going toward the North side of Lake Michigan, but if you're parking at a business be wary they might notice you using the lot as a non-customer.",

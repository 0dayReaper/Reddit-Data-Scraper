    "postText": "I am currently at the required credits needed to graduate after this semester. However, I am taking pretty intensive courses right now mainly BIO 120, and my CIS Capstone which are taking up the bulk of my time for studying. I am also juggling all of this with a 30 hour job right now and will transition to full time for after this semester in May. \n\nI say this because my job is expecting me to be full time in May and I currently cannot see myself passing one of the courses I am taking, specifically CIS 371 (Web Application Programming). After mid term week I realized that I probably am not going to pass. The exam was stupid hard and I ended up bombing it. I don't think the assignments from now until the end for that class can even bring my grade up to a passing grade after looking at the syllabus. I don't know what to tell my boss at my work place either as they are expecting me to be all finished up. I am afraid I will be fired or let go! UGH. I don't even know if I can walk this semester or if I have to walk in the Spring/Summer semester because of one class.\n\nThe good news is, I just checked and the CIS 371 class is offered in the summer by the amazing Professor Woodring. The class only goes for a month and two weeks after May 08 which is only two or so months after my initial graduation period if ended up dropping it and taking it in the Spring semester. \n\nI just need some advice because I am in a pickle and really close to graduating and have a terrific job right now. I just don't know if I should drop the class and focus on the other courses I am taking right now or stick it out and hope for the best.",

But act soon as can be because summer courses have a tendency to fill up depending on demand. It\u2019ll be okay!",

I do plan on talking to my boss Monday to see what he thinks before the 21st when I can register for the class. Also the drop date is the 24th so I have 10 days give or take to make a decision on that too.",

Ended up with somewhere between 150 and 160 credits. Kudos on the dual enrollment CC route; it\u2019s a great way to get things out of the way if you know what you want and a cheaper way to figure out what you don\u2019t like.",

The guy plays EU4 like crazy and talks about all the time. In terms of the class, it\u2019s rough for most students. I was the only one who got an A in that course. \n\nIf you think it\u2019s about city planning like I did, then you\u2019ll be disappointed. It\u2019s more about thinking systematically when it comes to cities and regions. I heard he was going to change the name but I don\u2019t know if he got around to it.",

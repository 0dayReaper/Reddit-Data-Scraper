How hard is it to actually get a GA( graduate assistantship)?\nAny anything I should know about the school. I\u2019m coming from way out of state. Any tips would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

            "comment": "Definitely reach out to the department. You can ask how many people will be in your cohort and how many positions they have available. This upcoming year might look a little different than the past with budgetary changes, transitioning to teaching online, more IT support needed, etc.\n\nThe other thing I would recommend is to consider and apply for GA positions that are available to all graduate students. The funding for these positions don\u2019t come from your department. Keep checking, as they get posted and filled all the time. https://www.gvsu.edu/gs/graduate-assistant-job-openings-25.htm I know a few people who found their assistantships a few weeks before the fall semester started.\nYou can also request access to GVSU\u2019s handshake to look for other positions there. You might want to think about applying to assistantships even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s directly related to the things you\u2019re studying - it will still pay for your education and provide you with opportunities to demonstrate \u201csoft skills\u201d and work experience to future employers or PhD applications.",

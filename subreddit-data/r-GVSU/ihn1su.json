It's the only food option on campus at the moment &amp; packed.\n\nWelp, get ready for the COVID Laker Line because the RAPID just got rid of capacity requirements on all their buses. And they are coming *less frequently* than last year, so more people packing in for sure.\n\nAlso, the CDC released new COVID guidelines saying that if you don't have any symptoms you may not need to get tested, even if you know you came into contact with someone with COVID. They say that Trump's administration pressured them to release these bat-shit crazy guidelines.\n\nWe are doomed.",

This past week the Provost and President stated that faculty are empowered to change the modes of our courses if we had a good reason and worked it out with our department chairs. Many are doing exactly that. We have the support of the upper administration for whatever we choose, but we are the ones being put in the position to make the choice. \n\nI considered moving all three of my hybrid courses online, but I'm currently surveying my students and in one class (two sections) half the students have responded and 2/3 of those want to keep the course hybrid and have F2F meetings. The other one has only 8 respondents out of 25 students but 3/4 want to keep it hybrid and not go fully online. So I'm keeping everything as is, while providing options for students to participate remotely if they need to. \n\nI'm not going to force anybody to be F2F if they don't wish to be. But it's also clear that despite everything, there's still a significant portion of students who really want to have F2F classes.",

We all know how this is going to go, seeing how the freshman are all living life as normal (dorm life, packing into kleiner), and surely it would be more cost effective to switch to online classes now, no? Rather than (inevitably) deciding to switch once the semester has already begun and everyone is already settled in?",

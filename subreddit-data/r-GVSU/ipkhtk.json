(Random shortness of breath started yesterday) No idea how I'm going to make that up and waiting to hear back from prof. Are your professors responding to your emails/do they have anything in the syllabus about making up missed work?",

The department chair is the professor's immediate supervisor and is in the best position to talk to the prof about it. The Dean oversees the entire college --- complaints escalated straight to the dean will just end up getting forwarded to the department chair anyway.",

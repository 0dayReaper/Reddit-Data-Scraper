    "postText": "Hi y'all, has anyone else been getting frequent advertisements for weighted blankets at the Laker Store?  I noticed that the proceeds support the Autism Speaks foundation, [which is a bad thing.](https://autisticmama.com/do-not-support-autism-speaks/) Foundations like the Autistic Self Advocacy Network are much preferred because they don't advocate for \"cures\" for autism, and they actually involve autistic people in their organization.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to get in touch with people at GVSU about not supporting Autism Speaks. I contact the Disability Support Resources number but didn't get much of a lead.\n\nDoes anyone else have thoughts on this, and are there any ideas for how to get in touch with the relevant people so that GVSU allies itself with less harmful organizations?\n\nEDIT: Link to ad [https://www.ocm.com/gvs/product/calming-weighted-15-pound-blanket-2147971749?list=search%20page#main-content](https://www.ocm.com/gvs/product/calming-weighted-15-pound-blanket-2147971749?list=search%20page#main-content). A normal advertisement, but the very end of the descriptions says \"Sales of this blanket support the Autism Speaks foundation.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Do you have any links to these ads? I\u2019d be more than happy to put together a slideshow or something about the flaws with autism speaks and some better alternatives for fundraising.",

I think a good point of contact is the promotions office in kirkhof. I think this is an important issue and hope this information was beneficial.\n\n[https://www.gvsu.edu/promotions/](https://www.gvsu.edu/promotions/)\n\n [promotions@gvsu.edu](mailto:promotions@gvsu.edu)",

I'm on track to be a special education teacher for kids on the spectrum, so I used to be a supporter when I was new to the path I'm on now. I wasn't aware of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, but I'm intrigued. I'll check them out when I get the chance. Do you know of any other solid organizations to look into that are supported by the community?",

You'd be better off contacting the company directly, though they seem kinda sketchy, so I don't think it will change anything tbh.",

I\u2019m looking for Millienials and Gen X-ers to take this survey regarding nonprofits and early childhood development. It should take you less than 5 minutes! Also if you know of anyone within this demographic please feel free to share. Thank you!\n\n[Survey!](https://gvsu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3xXDEYGgIoFrMep)",

Some unsolicited\\* feedback on your survey, ranked from more serious issues to less serious:\n\nYour last question reads like a \"check all that apply\" (which is possible to do in Qualtrics) but only allows the user to select one box. \n\nInstead of asking people to type in a ranking, Qualtrics allows you to have participants drop and drag items in a list to provide the ranking. This will decrease the number of incorrect rankings you get and reduce the data you have to discard. \n\nYour Likert-type items say are you more likely or less likely, but then your responses are \"very likely\" to \"not likely\"; your wording in the choices should be parallel to the wording in your prompt.  \n\n\n\\*I'm sorry. I research survey design, and you are Laker, not some random on the internet, so I have to offer my feedback. Feel free to disregard if this is an overstep. Good luck in your project!",

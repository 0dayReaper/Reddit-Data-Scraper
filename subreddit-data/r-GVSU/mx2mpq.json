So if you look around campus or in apartment complexes you might find something",

Right after classes end there's usually a weekend when most of the apartments 9 month leases expire and there's a ton to pick from. About 3 months later the 12 monthers end and there's a whole new round. \n\nThis year, I admittedly don't know when the exact dates are, though some others on this thread might know when their complex or their friends have to move out",

    "postText": "I recently got accepted to GVSU as a transfer student from Macomb CC and I was wondering what campus is like in the age of COVID. Are a lot of people back on campus and in person? Or are a lot of people still online? I would really like to meet new people this fall outside of roommates. I\u2019ve heard it can be somewhat difficult as a transfer student though. Are there clubs that are sizeable/active here?",

Some places are still closed on campus because Covid and just being understaffed, but a lot of people are on campus and I think most classes are in person. What I\u2019ve learned is that the amount of effort you put in really determines how much you get out of it. Staying in the apartment makes it difficult to meet people so go to sporting events and other campus activities, try out some different clubs, talk to the people in your classes and you\u2019re bound to make at least a few friends. Everyone at GV is super nice and approachable in my experience!",

GV is somewhat cliquey so it might take some time to find some cool people. Also, reminder to avoid Campus Dinning if you need to work. They lowball students and foster toxic work environments. Nearby places are more than happy to employ students and will go out of their way to make sure you're happy with your schedule.",

Covid took away my sophomore and junior year on campus, then went back for Senior. Both Campuses were lively in 2018 and 2022. Join 2-3 clubs and you\u2019ll have an easy time getting some involvement! These next 4 years are going to fly by. Enjoy college! PM me if you have any questions.\n\nEdit: oh you\u2019re a transfer, enjoy your time at GV**",

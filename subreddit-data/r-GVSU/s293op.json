They explained to me that there are no discussions higher up to plan for going online, as least that they\u2019ve been informed. They also told me that part of the decision to stay F2F instead of going online like many other schools may have been to prevent any major mental health detriments among students. As we know online took a huge toll on a lot of people. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the right decision, I\u2019d certainly feel safer online right now. But I think from the university\u2019s perspective there is no right decision in this.",

            "comment": "Being in person is absolutely ridiculous and unsafe right now. I don\u2019t like online classes  either, but for safety reasons, it needs to happen. There is absolutely no social distancing in any of my classes. We sit so close that our elbows touch. Not to mention my classes having a ton of people out for it including professors. Students also seem to not know how to wear their masks correctly. 8/18 people in my class yesterday wearing their mask either below their nose or even chin. If nothing else, the least professors could do is keep that at a minimum, but i\u2019ve never heard anyone reminded of such if it\u2019s not syllabus day.  This is especially concerning because there\u2019s a high rate of false negatives with the omicron variant and rapid tests which is all gvsu has (https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/how-reliable-are-covid-19-rapid-tests-for-detecting-omicron-11641747601). And if you want a PCR test you\u2019ll have to either drive an hour or wait 7 days for one to be available. Mental health is important but i also think it\u2019s fair to mention staying in person is causing a lot of people distress as well, there should at least be an option to be online. Previously gvsu was at level 3 and was completely online, now it\u2019s level 3 and it\u2019s \u201ctough shit\u201d. This situation has led me to believe gvsu only cares about money and has even had me looking to transfer. Gvsu needs to do better.",

Given how many profs I\u2019ve met that \u201cdon\u2019t like blackboard\u201d, I would imagine that profs not wanting to transition to fully online and the university not wanting to lose profs are a pretty big driving factor here.",

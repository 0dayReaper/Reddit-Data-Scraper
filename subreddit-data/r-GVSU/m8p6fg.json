    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m working on a story for the Lanthorn this week about the new stimulus checks that have gone out and how it will impact students. Is this the first check you\u2019ve gotten with the eligibility rules? Did you miss out because you\u2019re a dependent? How will getting not getting the check impact you? Leave a comment or send me a pm (I understand this might be a sensitive topic for some, so you can remain anonymous of course).",

I received all stimulus checks, most of which I saved or went towards my car payment. What I planned on doing was saving the money and investing, but due to some unfortunate circumstances I will need to use some of the money to purchase a new car. In conclusion, the stimulus checks will help in the near future and down the road.\nEdit: The OP has my permission to use this story, and may reply/PM me if they would like to know more.",

I was fortunate enough to have my parents give me a little bit of the first stimulus check (even though they didn\u2019t get anything for me and I didn\u2019t qualify) to help pay my tuition. Because I\u2019m 20 and a dependent, neither me nor my parents got money for me from the second one either. This most recent one, my parents gave me a bit more to cover the security deposit on a house I\u2019m leasing next year. Been pretty touch and go this year, working two jobs and unsure how I\u2019m going to afford rent every month but somehow it always works out. Would\u2019ve been nice if dependents older than 17 had been included to get their own checks out of all the stimulus checks.\n\nOP has permission to use this for a story and can DM/reply if more information is wanted",

I actually got the last checks through the recovery rebate as extra money on my tax return (both checks so $1800)\n\nI haven\u2019t been able to afford a car until these stimulus checks. Living in a rural town during the summer, this opens me up to better opportunities, more independence. Plus I can get an off campus job and not have to worry about depending on the bus. Not only that, my doctor office that is 13 miles away usually took a two hour bus ride due to how the bus system is spaces out. I can get to my doctor for my chronic health issues without worrying now.",

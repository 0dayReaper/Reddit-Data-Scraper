I try to tell people my story so hopefully they don't end up in a similar predicament.  \n\nLittle bit about me; Graduated from MSU in 07' with a B.A. Started off as Engineering, switched to Criminal Justice (pretty much since I heard Eng was super hard and many hours of studying), and finished with Telecommunications and Information Studies (what I could finish in 4 years). I always tell people its just a general studies degree though I didn't really have any direction. \n\nI would suggest really thinking about what you want to spend your life doing. Find a career you want and would love and take a degree that will get you there. If you would love both of them I wouldn't take one over the other since its harder, look at job prospects, average salary, etc to help decide. \n\nGoodluck!",

            "comment": "I graduated a couple years ago double majoring finance and business econ. \n\nIf you double major, most of your courses will (obviously) be related to your major. But you'll still take a little bit of everything. Marketing, accounting, etc. Use those courses to get a feel for all the different realms of Seidman. I started as an HRM major and got out of that very quickly. I know a lot of people that were accounting majors for one year then quickly switched.  \n\nThe class sizes are very small compared to STEM lecture halls. Like 30 students is a large class. My 400 level courses sometimes had 10-15. Find professors you like, Hoogstra is phenomenal for all things finance and his sections fill up quick. Real estate finance was one of my favorite courses because of him. \n\n There's only so many profs for each department so it's pretty easy to get ones you like for multiple classes over the years. It's also easy to get stuck with ones you can't stand so register ASAP and make a plan. Rate my professor is a great resource but it's kind of like Yelp reviews, take them with a grain of salt. Better to make friends and ask them about profs they've had and what they liked and disliked instead of the words of strangers who can often base their prof reviews on their grades. \n\nBusiness courses are funny though. They vary wildly in difficulty imo based on your major and your strengths. There's a reason communications is often considered the party major while something like international business could have you pulling your hair out. \n\nAlso you can double major in anything, but it's better long term if the two of them are related in someway and build on each other. Human resource management and supply chain management doesn't really make sense compared to doing finance and accounting. All depends on your interests and strengths though. \n\nI did 15 credits a semester and it gave me very little time for extra curriculars during my junior/senior years. It's not uncommon for people to lighten their load as things get intense. Many summer courses are available but it's more limited. Because every business student needs to take like macro micro econ, marketing, etc. The intro level courses are way easier. The first five weeks of every intro bus econ is basically the same lol. Once you get to the courses that only people in your major are taking, it gets intense quick. I second guessed my entire academic career during my finance capstone. \n\nStrongly recommend doing a study abroad program. There's tons of opportunities for business students and it's surprisingly affordable. Best decision I made in college and it was really simple to get that worked out. If you do study abroad, try to live in campus housing for the semester your at GV. They will take you out of your lease no problem while off campus housing will say \"tough luck, you signed a contract.\"\n\nOh and do everything you possibly can to get an internship. Seriously. Finding a job after graduation is immensely easier if you have any amount of work experience.",

                    "comment": "In my opinion it\u2019s pretty overwhelming. It\u2019s a 5 year program minimum (and that\u2019s assuming you\u2019re able to maintain the 14-19 credits a semester as suggested to stay on track)\n\nThe required classes are a lot more involved than what it seems to be. A lot of the classes used to be 3 credit courses but the university required the professors to \u201ccut hours\u201d to make it feasible to graduate in 5 years. The only issue with this is that the material itself wasn\u2019t cut. So your 1 credit class is more like a 3 credit class\n\nIf you\u2019re doing BME with a focus in instrumentation you must take a private lesson every semester, an ensemble every semester, and with your private lessons there\u2019s usually a studio class as well that gets scheduled after the semester starts (or at least. That\u2019s my experience). \n\nAll in all, it\u2019s a great program. The professors I\u2019ve had are wonderful and as long as you try in their classes they\u2019re willing to work with you to help you be successful. It\u2019s just a constant feeling of drowning that made me realize this program wasn\u2019t the best fit for me, but I know tons of BME students who love it!\n\nI pretty much just shared all the things I wished I had known going into the program that they don\u2019t tell you about. Hopefully this helps:)",

The only major difference between voice and instrument is that if you do an instrument focus you have to take two semesters of marching band (though most students do it for all four years before they student teach because they love it so much!)",

Interesting readings on leadership strategies with an emphasis on the social sciences, engaging lectures, and generous grading. Her story is inspiring and she makes an effort to meet with every student over coffee at some point in the semester, not just to talk about school, but to actually get to know you. I think about that class often and am so glad I took it!",

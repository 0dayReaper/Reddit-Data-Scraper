    "postText": "I really don't know how to feel about going back to GVSU this year. I love being on campus and all, but there's like what... 20K people on campus during the day? Walking from Freshmanland to Calder, from Laker Village to Mackinac... crowded Panda Express lines and a packed library....\n\nI can't help but feel it's only a matter of time before COVID hits campus... I'm honestly not sure what exactly I should do... it almost feels inevitable that we're gonna get shutdown by October. I don't know. I just had an uneasy feeling about going back.",

            "comment": "GVSU has definitely dropped the ball when it comes to informing the student/faculty population about the logistics of opening campus back up. Simply saying that they will keep classroom chairs 6 feet apart and close down some of the dining options is not enough. Many issues (what do we do if a student in a dorm/4x4 campus apartment gets infected? How will dining on campus work? How will you stop parties?) have not been directly addressed. You have reason to be uneasy.",

They are absolutely kidding themselves! A transferrable online class at the community college or a gap semester is fine with me.",

As long as you are wearing a mask indoors, hand washing/sanitizing, and keeping a good distance from others, you shouldn't have to be too worried. I feel like places like Panda express / the library will have markings or signs posted to help people keep a good distance.\n\nHere's to hoping for no more shutdowns.",

I made the decision to find all classes online, I just can\u2019t afford to possibly use an apartment anymore. The uncertainty makes it too scary and risky for me personally. Sorry if this makes you feel more uneasy, but I felt better after deciding to do this!",

Everyone knows the virus impact is a \"moving target\" so there is no one right answer. A semester is basically 3 months so missing one or two is not the end of your college career. Especially in the time of COVID. \nBest of luck!",

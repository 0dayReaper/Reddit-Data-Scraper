Head to the Performing Arts Center office and talk to the people in there about signing up for practice room time slots, they\u2019ll point you in the right direction",

At the start of each semester students can go to the PAC office and put their name down on a number of different times/days for both PAC and Murray practice rooms. After the sign up window has closed the sheets go up at the doors of each room. \nThis way musicians have guaranteed practice time. If the room\u2019s occupant does not show for 15 minutes anyone can claim that time slot in that room for the day. Any time slot unclaimed can also house anyone for that time.",

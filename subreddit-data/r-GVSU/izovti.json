Planning for the Winter semester is underway, and out of concern for the safety of our students, staff, and faculty, GVSU has decided to modify the Winter 2021 academic calendar.  \n\nThe revised academic calendar starts on Tuesday, January 19, the day after the Martin Luther King Jr. commemoration, eliminates spring break, and ends on May 1. This results in a 15-week semester, consistent with past semesters, and instructional time is unchanged. The operational continuity of the university also remains unchanged \u2013 university offices will be open beginning Monday, January 4 as normal. \n\nPlease also note, and share with students with whom you come in contact, that courses for the Winter 2021 semester will continue to be a mix of in-person, hybrid, and online. Units, colleges, and the registrar\u2019s office are working together to make the necessary changes to the existing Winter 2021 course schedule, which was put in place before COVID-19 was affecting GVSU. We are striving to offer flexibility and options in course delivery methods in order to accommodate the various needs of all of our students. \n\nOur goal is to have most of the course schedule changes in place by early November, although changes could continue beyond that based upon health and safety or programmatic needs. As we are all working to respond to external circumstances beyond our control, please know that any changes we make are necessary to provide a safe learning and working environment for all involved. \n\nIf you have questions, please contact your appointing officer.\n\nSincerely,\nMaria C. Cimitile\nProvost and Executive Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs\n\nB. Donta Truss\nVice President for Enrollment Development and Educational Outreach",

            "comment": "I know having no Spring Break is a bummer, but as a faculty member, I am very happy to have two extra weeks tacked onto holiday break. Every year I struggle to get my Winter semester courses ready in time, since I have all summer to plan Fall classes but just 2 weeks to do the same for Winter. (And trying to build Winter courses starting in November just doesn't work.) \n\nThe only time in my 25 year career I didn't struggle with this was when I taught at a different college that had a \"January term\" that I only taught every other year, so in the off year I had 6 weeks to prep. Especially with the amount of structuring and organization that goes into building an online class, I'm grateful to have the extra time. Ask me again in March how I like it, LOL.",

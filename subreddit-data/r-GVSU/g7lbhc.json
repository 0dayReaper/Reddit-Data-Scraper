    "postText": "Howdy yall, transferring to Grand Valley this fall for mech. engineering. Does anyone here know about the ham radio club at GVSU? It seems that it may not be active at the moment as its not listed on those club lists so I though I would consult with y'all if there would be anyone to talk to about all the nice looking ham radio equipment thats in the downtown campus\n\nThanks for the help",

Dr. Baine is the trustee for the station. A windstorm took out the antenna, but that is fixable and is all that keeps W8GVU off the air.",

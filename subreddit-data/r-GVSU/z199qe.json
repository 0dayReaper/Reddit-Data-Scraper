I think GVSU does a great job at creating a well-rounded curriculum with a bit of room to explore your particular interests.\n\nI peeked at your post history and noticed you\u2019ve played around with Unity a bit. The program here leaves a little to be desired when it comes to game dev-specific coursework/resources, and our Game Programming course just recently became official after having been a \u201cSpecial Topics\u201d course for a few semesters. We have a minor program called Digital Studies which is a great supplement to the CS program and covers technology outside of purely technical details\u2014it also provides ample opportunities for creative projects (where you could make a game, for instance), and they have a course called Game Culture, where you can play, critically evaluate, and discuss games in a cultural context if you\u2019re into that sort of thing.\n\nAll this is to say that the program is certainly in a growth period, and there are some dedicated members of the faculty that want to foster a proper game dev program, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after.\n\n[This page](https://www.gvsu.edu/catalog/program/bachelor-of-science-in-computer-science.htm) is a great resource for understanding how the CS program is structured at GVSU.",

Certainly, you may have access to more resources and variety at a bigger school, but it may come at a cost of the kind of attention you get from faculty, unless you really advocate for yourself and work harder to build relationships with professors.\n\nMost CS classes range about 20-30 students per course section, so you have more opportunities to 1) build relationships with your peers as you\u2019ll likely see them more often, and 2) build relationships with faculty because the class sizes are so small. I can\u2019t say how this operates at universities that operate with massive lecture halls, but I can imagine it\u2019d be more difficult to do so.\n\nBut if you\u2019re only concerned about the amount of resources a program has, a larger school with more attention and funding will likely win out. Either way the CS program at GVSU is very well-rounded\u2014if you end up graduating not knowing exactly where you\u2019d like to specialize, the program still leaves you with plenty of skills to apply wherever you end up.",

They're hard working, no-nonsense learners who get stuff done and don't have the air of entitlement that some students from more elite universities have. And I think the CIS department does a great job of getting students to produce actual bodies of work that they can present to employers, and not just graduate with a certain GPA (which most employers could care less about). \n\nBeyond the area, I'd defer to others' opinions on that, but I do know that I stay connected with a lot of my students on LinkedIn and they go on to some pretty impressive jobs and graduate programs all over the country.",

            "comment": "Okay I am definitely the person to answer this question. I was never the smartest in HS. In fact, I had a 980 SAT score, but got into GVSU nonetheless. I chose CS mainly because I liked to program and code software. I saw a career out of it so decided to purse CS. Out of the other universities in Michigan when comparing to GVSU's CS program, I would say GVSU is top notch. The reason I say this is because GVSU does a tremendous job in preparing you in getting a job/internship. For example, MSU does not require you to have an internship. Shoot, they don't even make you take an internship prep course where they show you how to build a resume, LinkedIn, cover letter, how to interview, nothing. Another big thing is that you have to have an internship in order to graduate. MSU does not care about this and I do not know about U of M but it might be similar. GVSU focuses a-lot on preparing you for what the job or work place is like for a CS student. Speech is also a class you must take as a CS student here because well lets face it, most CS students are not outgoing and lack person to person skills. GVSU does it's best to break this norm and it definitely pays off. The thing also about other universities like MSU or U of M is that these colleges focus more on the math, and engineering parts of CS which is why the classes I believe are more engineering and math related. GVSU is a liberal arts school and still has the CS degree in a Bachelors of Science degree but the other colleges are really more engineering and math based than GVSU. I have one semester left till I graduate and just landed a job literally yesterday thanks to my three internship experiences and such. GVSU has done wonders for me and can't wait to be a first generation college student.",

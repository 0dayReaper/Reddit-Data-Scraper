    "postText": "I thought about taking STA 215 this summer but there weren\u2019t any spots available when I tried to sign up. A few spots are now available and I\u2019m wondering if I can still register for it even though classes started today? If so, can anyone advise to how STA 215 is as an online class? Is it difficult? I currently have it in my fall schedule so I\u2019m trying to figure out whether I should switch it to this summer or leave it. Math is not my strong suit and I would have the same professor (Helmholdt) for both summer and fall. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",

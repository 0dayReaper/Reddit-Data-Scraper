    "postText": "Hi! I'm going to be an incoming freshman in the fall, and I'm having a lot of trouble deciding between SLO or San Diego State. I honestly don't know what I want to major in yet; at SDSU I'm undeclared, and would probably go into public health or business/real estate. At SLO, I'm in graphic communication, but would most likely want to change it to something else... probably in engineering since that's what SLO is known for. I really like both campuses and I know I'll be happy at either school, but I'm also concerned about the reputation of the schools and their systems. People have told me SLO is more prestigious and has a more respected degree after graduation. I sort of see SDSU as a party school, but know the academics are still great. As for the systems, I come from a semester system highschool, and am scared if I go to SLO, I might not be able to keep up with the quarter system. Also I'm not sure if SLO is as small-college town as people say? I like SDSU primarily because its close to a city. If anyone has any suggestions or things that can help me sway my decision that would be great, thank you!!!",

            "comment": "Don't listen to the other guy who said changing your major is impossible. It certainly isn't. I know many people who've done so, including myself. Unless you want to go into CS or SWE, it for sure is a possibility to change your major. \n\nBut, don't change your major just because cal poly is known for engineering. The GRC program at Cal Poly is amazing, and employers *love* the students who graduate from it. If you're passionate about graphic design, then I'd say that Cal Poly is the way to go. \n\nHowever, on your last point, SLO is the quintessential college town. Half the residents are students. A lot of the town and its culture revolves around the students. It is also very far away from a major city. Santa Barbara is \\~1.5 hours south on a good day of traffic. LA and SF are even farther. It does feel like living in a bubble, unlike a college in a / next to a major city like SDSU. I personally was weary of this when committing to Cal Poly, but so far I'd say it hasn't been a big issue. I don't feel \"trapped\" like I thought I would. \n\nI also came from a semester-based high school, and it took me a quarter to adjust to the pace of the quarter system. I like it better, honestly, because there's more variety in the classes I'm taking this year (also only 10 weeks of public speaking instead of 15). Also, there's usually less content covered on finals, so it's a bit less of a cram at the end of the quarter. If you just stay on top of your work, then you'll be fine.",

            "comment": "Due to major changing restrictions at Cal Poly, you'd probably be a quarter or two behind on what you end up in so that's something to consider. Also yeah they specifically designed the major changing process to prevent people from getting in as GRC and changing to engineering so you wouldn't have a good time fighting the departments on that. Not impossible but if you want to have a good time the stress from that will probably have an impact and you'd need to do pretty well in all your classes. I was in Aero for 4 whole years and never even heard about someone changing majors into it from outside of Engineering. A lot of people did change majors out of Aero tho to MechE or the Sciences during the weeder classes\n\nAnecdotally I have one friend who changed major 3 times all within the Sciences but ended up on what they started and so managed graduating in 3 years due to AP and stuff. My freshman roommate however had a heck of a time changing from Ethnic Studies (Liberal Arts I think) to Child Development (sciences) tho and it was the main thing he wrestled with every quarter as a first year for class registration especially\n\nAll that to say you'd be at a more difficult school and making it harder on yourself outside of the classroom so you should be really set on your choice so you won't have regrets. Other than that make a Pro/Con chart in google docs. That's what I did when I had to choose between CP and other colleges (including SDSU)",

            "comment": "Congrats on both! I would definitely ask yourself if you want to be in a city or in a small town feel. As well as looking into what the schools offer for fun since you\u2019re gonna be spending the next 4 years there. Quarter system can be quite tough here for freshman, but there is a lot of resources here to help you succeed. So definitely look into each campus resources to see which ones are more promising. I hope this helps. Good luck on your decision. I\u2019m sure where ever you end up. You\u2019ll be good. Also I\u2019m from San Diego so if you have any questions about SD feel free to ask!",

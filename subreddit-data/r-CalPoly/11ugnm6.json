    "postText": "Hi! My name is Lauren Yamane and I am a first-year food science major at Cal Poly. I can\u2019t drive. Because I don\u2019t have a license, I wanted to learn more about the walkability of SLO and ways to implement more walkable infrastructure in the city to improve environmental and quality of life factors for current and future Cal Poly students. Right now, SLO is a fairly walkable city; the only problem is that SLO has appealed to cars over the years, reducing its beauty and functionality as a historic city center. The cars that many of you drive contribute up to a quarter of the total carbon emissions in the United States, which speeds up the rate at which climate change and global warming impact the environment.\n\nLuckily, there\u2019s an easy way to start contributing to the preservation of our atmosphere, and you can start right now. Promoting a walkable SLO as a student is as simple as continuing to use public transportation like the SLO Transit buses, which allow Cal Poly students to ride for free with their student ID instead of the usual $1.50 fare. Or if you\u2019ve already brought your car to campus, you can carpool with your friends or offer to give underclassmen a ride to prevent wasting gas.\n\nEven better, for civil engineering or regional planning majors, you are a key constituent in reintroducing walkability to San Luis Obispo or any other city that suffers from the same problem. You all know more than I would about this topic, and in your future careers you would work closely with city officials and transportation engineers to solve pertinent issues like pedestrian &amp; bike safety and road maintenance. As a Food Science major, my realm of study doesn\u2019t deal with this problem, but I know that Cal Poly has one of the best civil engineering programs in California (so I\u2019ve heard), and I think that the students under this program have all of the tools to be able to make this solution possible in the future.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this! If you want to learn more about my findings, confirm my facts, or feel like you can help achieve this goal, feel free to email me at [lyamane@calpoly.edu](mailto:lyamane@calpoly.edu).",

This sector includes Airplanes, ships, automobiles, and shipping trucks. Automobiles are responsible for about half of the transportation sector emissions (~13% total).

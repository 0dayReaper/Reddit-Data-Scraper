He asked me if he should factor in that he\u2019ll be here during the switch to Semesters (he\u2019s ok with semesters but is worried the actual transition period will be hard with classes converting in the middle of his degree).  Also he\u2019s concerned about the library being closed for 2 years.  Would love y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts before I respond to him.  How important are these factors do you think?",

(I'm one of the second group, I needed ArcGIS Pro and my laptop was too wimpy. A not wimpy computer was like 1500 but the computers in the library had the specs necessary. I wasn't about to buy a computer for one course so I spent a lot of time in the computer lab)",

However, this was a high school of about 500 students. \n\nI don\u2019t think that changing to semesters will be catastrophic, however, as many CSUs have done so in the past, so Cal Poly has framework for how it should be done. I personally wouldn\u2019t use it as a deciding factor. \n\nThe library thing\u2026 I don\u2019t know. IMO the campus will adapt in the way that it\u2019ll adapt. Kind of hard to tell how it\u2019ll go until the library actually closes. I would use this as a deciding factor.",

On the other hand I hear about the shitshow that changing semesters will be all the time from the engineering faculty. There's a lot of debate on what's getting kept, shifted, and discarded, and every professor has a passionate opinion on it. It's not simple to just adapt thermo 1 from quarters to trimesters. They basically have to reshuffle the learning objectives for every course, ESPECIALLY the ones in a series like the 6 required thermofluids classes (thermo 1+2, fluids 1+2, heat transfer, thermal systems). Extreme example and not unsolvable, but I wouldn't be eager to be attending as one of the guinea pigs for the new course pathways.\n\n-- A senior ME (mechatronics) transfer student",

Classes that they deem WDF (Withdraw, D, or F) will have their content stay the same as they get extended to 16 weeks in the hope that more people will pass these classes. I know BMed is increasing the number of labs they are going to offer. The CENG department chairs have been having weekly meetings to discus their plan for their individual major\u2019s curriculum. A lot of classes will be rolled into each other and graduation time is not expected to change. That being said, I only got positive news from the dean because we are supposed to be persuasive. That being said, the departments are treating this like a once in a lifetime opportunity to rewrite the curriculum, so student might be Guinea Pigs for those first couple of years.",

Cal Poly students come from high-income families. Child income is highly correlated with parental income.\n\nTo actually determine what is good value for money for you, you have to break down graduate income by parental income cohort, which is a more difficult analysis than is possible with this slider.",

Colleges like UCB and UCLA admitted students with better grades than Cal Poly, and yet Cal Poly students make more money after graduation. I think Learn By Doing has something to do with it!",

The average Cal Poly family makes $157,000.\n\nTo be clear, you might be right, but you can\u2019t tell from this data. You need more granular breakdowns so that you can compare people from the same cohort where the only independent variable is the school they attended.",

            "comment": "If you're trying to get a ballpark idea of how much you should budget? That's a very different question than how much do people spend on average\n\nLike, I knew someone whose parents paid for *everything* and as long as the credit card bill was under $2k/month their parent didn't question it. I've seen people blow $300/night going downtown every weekend. I've also known other low-income students who would save up so they could do a matinee and restaurant meal once a month (use poly card to bus downtown for free, $10-$15 per ticket, then $20-$25 for a cheaper-side restaurant meal, so grand total would be $30-$40 a month)\n\nThe \"spending more than you think\" is likely from folks who do the things first, then look at their bank account later. If you want to figure out what a reasonable entertainment budget is you have to think backwards. Plan out what you think a reasonable amount of entertainment and dining out is, google around for pricing, then tally it up",

I spend around $15 a week on entertainment (you can do the math) if I\u2019m on campus. If I go off campus that weekend oh boy it\u2019s probably around $100-150 for that weekend alone.",

Also if im working out, the food costs increase a bunch.\n\nEdit: This may also be due in part to me getting the lowest food plan so i run out quickly. (hence the 1k extra per quarter). It also might be closer to $1500 per quarter tbh.",

You can certainly survive fine, if you\u2019re in-state, with loans and a weekend job. The event industry in slo is pretty poppin so working weekends for caterers or events companies is pretty solid. Also lotta bartending and winery jobs. Good luck!",

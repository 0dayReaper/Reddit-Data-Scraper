    "postText": "TLDR: I wonder what minors would be best for a City and Regional Planning major who aims to graduate in Spring 2025. Mainly thinking about Construction Management or Real Property Development. Not sure if it is too late for me.\n\nCity and Regional Planning major who is contemplating doing a minor. While my main area of interest is transportation, I'm also pretty interested in the field of construction and urban development. At some point earlier this year, I was somewhat regretting my choice to switch majors into CRP and not look into Construction Management beforehand, and even thought about switching again to it at one point, but decided not to as it would hold my graduation back too much. Now I'm thinking about minoring in Construction Management or Real Property Development. Beyond that, I want to do something GIS-related because I have a strong interest in geography, but it seems like the closest minor they have here is GIS for Agriculture. Statistics seems kind of interesting too and I heard it's a useful subject (although it would be more out-of-the-way). I am looking for a minor that is not too difficult and would hopefully still give me the ability to graduate in Spring 2025. I'm a bit concerned about whether it's still possible or not, or whether I should even bother doing a minor instead of maybe focusing more energy on getting an internship or job or extracurriculars, because in the past I have struggled to manage 13+ units in a quarter without having to do an incomplete for at least one course (FWIW I have a learning disability). I heard from some recruiters that you don't necessarily need a CM major to get into CM and there are plenty of CRP majors that get into CM, which makes me wonder how much a minor like CM would actually help when applying to CM jobs/positions. Just wondering, what minors would you recommend for someone like me? I wonder if anyone here has input on what the minors (either the ones I mentioned or any of them) are like, how difficult they are, or if there is a better suggestion than the ones I discussed.\n\nThis quarter, I am enrolled in CM 232, which is an elective for the CM minor and a required course for the RPD minor. I'm debating whether to keep or drop it. I learned about it from a couple of classmates from my CRP studio last quarter who are minoring in CM and/or RPD and will likely be taking the course with me.\n\nI am not sure if I should declare the CM minor when it opens up on the second Monday of this quarter because I am afraid the ship might sail if I don't. I will talk to the minor coordinator (Jenay) soon but I would like to see if anyone who is or was in a similar situation to me has any additional advice.",

I was able to overlap many of the courses with my remaining GEs and had to take maybe 3 additional courses overall.\n\nWas it the best bang for my buck? Idk, but it was super enjoyable and looked outstanding on my resume",

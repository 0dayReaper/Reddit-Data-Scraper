Most of the stats majors I know are doing very well and the good thing about the major is that it's really small so you get more attention from professors. I haven't heard the best things about UCSB's department as I heard there were issues on getting classes and the quality of the classes too but don't take my word for it and ask the people at ucsb subreddit on their opinions. Stats undergrad at calpoly is one of the best in the world being on par with schools such as UCLA and UC davis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMight also be a good thing to ask r/statistics too since they have really valuable knowledge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: I didn't see you premed. I wouldn't recommend a double major then. As a bio major who took a lot of stats and cs courses I strongly recommend you stick to one. Both are difficult maajors in their own right and stats in college isn't like stats in high school especially the upper divison courses. I would only major in one however a caveat I would like to give is that you should only major in bio if and only if you know for sure you like bio and you're set on med school. Otherwise, you're stuck with a degree with very limited options and a stats degree at calpoly opens much more options",

The added benefit would be Cal Poly is well known for engineering, you have more options assuming you don't attend grad school, and there is greater rigor in an engineering degree so I think you'd be properly challenged instead of double majoring.",

My main concern rn is if i decide to drop premed for whatever reason id still wanna do something similar to biostats/informatics or biotech but regardless, I'd stick with stats over bio any day. What would I need to do to switch to engineering?  \nAlso with AP/CC credits, I only have 2 unrelated GEs that wouldn't overlap with my major(s?) which is why I would think I have the time for a double major, but I still don't know and will likely drop it down to a minor which is another kinda unrelated question but do they really take all these AP credits?",

Keep in mind though that bmed here is pretty engineering heavy and less bio heavy. Lots of overlap with me up until your 3/4th year.  I would add a caveat to u/frostyblucat advice. Med schools don\u2019t really care what major you are, they mostly care about gpa and mcat which is why do a major you really care about if you\u2019re going this route.\n\n\nAre you sure you don\u2019t have overlaps because there is almost no overlap with between stats and bio so doing double major will for sure take you 4-5 years. You seem like you\u2019re leaning towards stats more so I would do that and then get involved with clinical care. Honestly a lot of bio classes don\u2019t really overlap with medical applications but the classes that do have relevance are mostly molecular bio, physiology, and Biochem.",

Also would I still be able to take UD bio courses like immunology if I met the prereqs for the course?

You still have to do GEs that include stuff like english, art, history,etc. As for immunology, I don't think that class will be too hard to get. Couple seats will be reserved for microbio students but then you can take that class. I don't think you can take that class super early though because genetics is a prereq and it's an upper division biology class with other prereqs. In general bio classes aren't super hard to get tbh the only classes I got trouble getting were cs classes which you might want to take if you want to go in to the biostats/bioinformatics route as programming is basically essential in those fields now.",

I just checked and immunology isn't listed in the required courses so you wouldn't get priority. That doesn't mean you can't get the class though since there are always free spots available to all majors although it will definitely be harder to get (you might need to wait until junior or senior years when you have higher course selection priority due to more credits under your belt)\n\nLink is here so you can refer to what classes/options you have.\n\n[https://flowcharts.calpoly.edu/](https://flowcharts.calpoly.edu/)\n\nAlso, as u/itachi194 noted GPA is definitely the most important factor and the specific major doesn't matter as much, which is also why your first idea of double majoring is risky. In the end your decision should be based on where your interests lie and what is most practical. Double majoring is absolutely doable, but getting a 4.0 and double majoring would be literal hell if you're trying to graduate in 4 years.\n\nEdit: As a side note, one of my close friends is double majoring in stats and bio at UCSB as she wants to go into Biostats (akin to one of your own interests) but she is not considering a premed track at all. The two routes are vastly different not necessarily in content but in your focus/values on what is most important for your future career so you should definitely evaluate your options and decide on which is more interesting to you. I can give you her contact info if you would like to ask her how it is (she's a current freshman like myself so we really haven't taken much though)\n\nAlso, if stats is your primary interest you could also maybe minor in bio. I'm not well versed in the value of a biology minor or anything science related tbh so you'd have to do more research to determine which combination of biology and stats is the best for your goals.",

The elective units are all bs though since they don't help for anything.\n\nIn regard to time, its probably doable to double major, but as someone who plans to declare a double major next year (I'm a current freshman econ major and want to declare stats as a double next fall when you start) I don't think it's worth it for you, assuming you're even considering premed. The most important aspect for premed is your GPA and you really won't be able to maintain a high GPA if you're double majoring. I'm taking 24 units right now and my GPA is pretty bad (bad is relative but I'm averaging at a 3.3-3.4 for my first year which isn't great since I'm still considering law school as an option which would require at least a 3.85 for a chance at where I want to go). Also, I had applied and got accepted to study abroad in Taiwan fall quarter, but I withdrew last minute because I don't receive enough credits to graduate in 4 years with my double major if I did go. By taking one more challenging major (BME), and maybe minoring (CS/STATS) you have more flexibility to maybe study abroad, participate in more clubs, and get the 4.0 gpa.\n\nFor swapping majors as long as you maintain a high GPA (aim for a 3.9-4.0 since you would want that even for premed track) you can swap majors after one quarter. I don't know the rates but just maintain a high gpa and maybe demonstrate interest in the other major by joining a club and you should be fine. Communicate with your college advisors as well and check the website for swapping majors.",

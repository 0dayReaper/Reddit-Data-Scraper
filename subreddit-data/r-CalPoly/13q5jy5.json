I can appreciate what they're doing for sustainability and I support small businesses. I just think maybe there should be a dedicated day where all the shops pop up and then the lawn can be normal for the rest of the week kinda like the farmers market downtown.",

We don't even have many lawns / open space as it is. Asides from that, the constant frat selling xyz stuff and all that is crazy. I agree with OP, that it should be open whenever to non sale related activities, but if you are selling something, you gotta do it on a specific day with all the other vendors.",

To get an eplan you have to be part of a registered club. \n\nSome events are exceptions like the annual craft fair but you register through asi for that. \n\nSome of the resellers may be filling out eplans through their friend's club or something, or it may be an event through their club, but I'm fairly certain that this is the minority. There's not really anyone who comes through and audits these things so there's not really anything stopping them from just setting up cause they feel like it. \n\nThe eplan is basically calpoly's way of making sure everything is ok insurance wise. They also don't care a whole lot unless there's something that's an insurance risk, and I'm not too sure clothing reselling falls into insurance risk.",

I assume club permits need to fall into some sort of \"fair use\" clause that means the event has to actually have something to do with that club and I seriously doubt the sellers are fundraising for clubs. But as you pointed out I don't think anybody cares or pays attention lol\n\nWhen I was looking up info I found other colleges like [Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/~policies/presidential-orders/presidential_order_sale_of_nonfood_items.shtml) had much more detailed rules. Cal poly should seriously consider implementing something similar before things get worse",

    "postText": "I'm a first-year international student living on campus, and I'm scheduled to move into PCV next year. My plans for this summer are not finalized yet; I could be visiting many places and if I happen to go home to Dubai, I can't afford to take all my belongings with me. Is there a place I can safely store all my stuff for the summer? Maybe a service that CP Housing offers? They said they can't let me move into PCV 3 months early and store my belongings there.",

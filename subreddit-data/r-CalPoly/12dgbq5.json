    "postText": "Hey everyone, housing application opens today and I was wondering what dorms were best.\n\nI\u2019m inclined towards yak but i\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s not a social community and is far from most classes. And although the bathrooms look fantastic, i\u2019m not into shared community bathrooms at all.\n\nAlso, is it worth getting a double over a triple for an extra $2k?\n\nDoes anyone have any personal experiences and opinions to share about any of the dorms you have lived in? \n\nThanks a lot.",

            "comment": "All the first years have shared bathrooms. Yak\u0294It\u02b8ut\u02b8u just has the most private. North mountain shares with less people but the shower is just covered by a single curtain and the toilet stalls are not private at all. \n\nDid they say double rooms were available this year? Because to my knowledge they were pretty much all triples so i'm unaware of the changes if so. But if you have the money to spend, then spend it. I cant endorse spending that much money just to have one less person though tbh.\n\nAlso, the social community thing just depends on the people, not the building (in my personal opinion) so I really don't believe people that much when they say certain buildings party more. When I lived in yak\u0294it\u02b8ut\u02b8u there was a difference in floors; one floor would have so many people in the bathroom talking to each other and another would have no one in there ever. One floor was super messy and didnt have toilet seat covers ever and another one was always clean and stocked. \n\nThat was entirely my experience though. I've used the nomo bathrooms and the yak\u0294it\u02b8ut\u02b8u ones but not the other first year housing ones so I don't have much to say about it. However I think there are pool tables in red bricks so that's fun",

            "comment": "I lived in Yak part of my first year. The pros are that all of the amenities are relatively new. The cons is that most of the rooms are either triple or quad. I would highly recommend getting a quad over a triple (unless you get the big triple) because the triple is super small. The laundry situation in yak is horrible. Most of the time one of our washers were broken if not multiple. For the socialization aspect, my floor was very social. We had two major friend groups on the floor. Basically, it is what you make of it. The first quarter I didn't want to socialize so I didn't. But second quarter I had a lot of friends on my floor that I hung out with.\n\nNorth mountain seems generally like the best pick. It doesn't have the fancy appeal but it is super close to Baker which is where many STEM kids will have their classes. In North mountain you only have to share the room with one other person which is better in yak. Generally the rooms also are the same size if not larger than the yak triple.",

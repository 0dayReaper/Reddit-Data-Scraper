Studio art is very small.\n\nHere are things to consider when deciding on graphic design schools and its up to you on what matters to you ?\n\n\\-Cost? It definitely cheaper than art schools and its quite good   \n\\-What do senior portfolio look like?-Are career fairs offered? We do not have career fairs btw (students typically have to try harder to find opportunities)-Are you looking into doing graphic design or illustrations? Because we have Illustration classes offered but its a elective and not granted to be offered every year btw-compare and contrast flowcharts and read the description of classes and see if these are classes you want to take when comparing other schools  \n\n\nDesign is whatever you put into it\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions",

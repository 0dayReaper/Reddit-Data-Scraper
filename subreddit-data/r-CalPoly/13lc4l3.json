If you had a friend nearby without a car you could use their spot. The closest completely unrestricted parking I've found is over near Kentucky street I think. Or perhaps Garfield but that feels like its further. It's all houses near campus so even if it's not marked you'll probably beef with the tenants there. Street parking by apartments is better cuz they have a tenant lot usually. Zipcar is a good option if you don't need your car more than once a week. Car theft isn't a big problem here, but I don't know anyone who's tried to street park for a whole year. I dunno of any parking lots in SLO anymore that aren't paid or tow unauthorized cars. They might be around, but probably not near campus",

The laundry room is shared between buildings so like bishop and islay are next to each other, in between the two is the laundry room on the 1st floor. \nOther: The hill is ass to walk up and down. I use my bike to and fro. If you have a car you\u2019ll need a permit for either R3 or R4. R3 is the closest but if ur not a huge fan of walking it\u2019s ass. The parking lot next to CV is free on the weekend (if you have a res permit I think). On the weekdays you\u2019ll need a one day permit which is $7. (Boo) I think that\u2019s about it, ask any other questions if you\u2019d like!",

There is a real language barrier with Zhang, which can lead to some communication problems and difficulties during lectures. But if you are smart and decently tech savvy, all you have to do is show up and do the assignments. Also he has it setup where if you get certified in the two programs (Alteryx and Tableu) you don\u2019t have to take the final which is a major plus.",

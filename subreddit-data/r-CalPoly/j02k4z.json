Compare the budgets of two or three consecutive years to see where they're gouging you. \n\nTangentially, it seems to be a measure of a \"real institution of higher learning\" that it can survive financially without having a football season.",

He also gave generous raises to the admin higher-ups, all the time while denying raises to people in the trenches doing the actual work. He then stopped building classroom/labs and started building profit making items such as dorms and eateries. The problem you see now is that all the profit making things he did require students to be on campus, so they can be used to fund his initiatives. \n\nWe all know all about how Cal Poly works because it's a public institution. But do we? No. The Foundation (or whatever they call themselves after corruption required them to change their name) was created as a separate entity that allowed Cal Poly to hide their financial dealings under the guise of being a helping sister organization for Cal Poly. Additionally, part the Foundation includes strong PR: they'll always tell you about the great stuff they're doing. The truth is that the Foundation takes a dollar from you, keeps fifty cents of that dollar, then tells you how great they are because they give you back the other fifty cents. Recall that that Foundation also gives Jeffrey an \"allowance\" of something on the order of $60k/year.",

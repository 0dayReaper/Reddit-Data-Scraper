            "comment": "So in terms of loans (which is probs what will need to happen based off of the \\~30k price tag if you're in state), the federal government will only allow you to take out a $6,500 loan through them. Anything more than that would have to be taken out through a private loan company. \n\nIn terms of cutting down costs of education, look into scholarships that you're eligible for. Don't just do it through Cal Poly; I'd look at outside companies that award scholarships. \n\nOtherwise, there are ways to save on housing. For most people, first year is the most expensive year for housing, and takes up the bulk of that 30k. Going into second year, rent can get pretty cheap if you decide to share a room with someone. There's also becoming an RA, which gives you free housing and a food stipend. It is, however, highly competitive to become an RA, especially going into sophomore year. That would be your best bet in getting your cost down to just tuition and books.",

            "comment": "See if you can find a job in your dept as it will help you to get to know your professors. Be sure to apply for all the scholarships you can. It is free money and it encourages you to do well in your field of study.\nHousing is what will kill your budget. It goes up faster than anything else and when you move off campus you'll be spending a lot on credit application checks with no guarantee you'll get anything. \n\nRunning a side hustle is a great idea. Cal Poly's Entrepreneur center runs competitions that you should practice pitching for and can help you develop your business. https://cie.calpoly.edu/",

We\u2019ve been too broke to save most of her life but make enough money now that she doesn\u2019t qualify for loans and grants. If she gets married, she doesn\u2019t have to include our income/assets on her aid applications and can state that she has basically nothing. Good luck!",

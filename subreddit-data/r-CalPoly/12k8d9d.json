            "comment": "Academically: The first quarter may be a tough transition, so seek out academic resources to help if you are struggling. There are tons from study sessions to free tutoring to office hours, and I would strongly encourage joining supplemental workshops for classes that they are offered for (especially if you are in state and not paying per unit). Additionally, take advantage of all the advising and resources available. If you are curious about your professors, look at the rate my professor page on reddit, or google cal poly rate my professor. I have never had a professor for my major that wasn't excited to share their general advice and options for research, so if that sounds like something you are interested in try to connect with them. You do not have to be in a class with them to get to know professors. \n\nSocially: Walk around, and into classes, with a smile on your face and try to be approachable. If you don't vibe with your roommates or people on your floor or just are just looking for more social connections, join clubs or organizations (professional, a hobby you are interested in, or cultural and diversity based orgs) and actively participate in them!",

Cal Poly used to offer official group study sessions for some classes; join those if you can.  Attend office hours.  Do the homework and reading.  Email the professor with questions.  It's much easier to ease back on studying vs. scrambling to improve.\n\n* Join an intramural sports team if that interests you.  It's a great way to blow off steam and meet people.",

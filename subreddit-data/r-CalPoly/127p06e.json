WHO said we don\u2019t need the vaccine, although if you had half a brain you already knew this 3 years ago. I never got vaxxed, cal poly said I needed to do testing, I maybe got tested 2 times lol. They just never checked. I was able to go to class, the gym, etc all without following their bs rules. And nobody did anything about it because it was a a show. They don\u2019t give a flying fuck about your health LOL. So #trustthescience and don\u2019t get the vax. Also you can\u2019t say I\u2019m anti science because the fucking WHO agrees with me lol",

            "comment": "Because the strains 3 years ago are way different from what they are now. It's evolved to be more infectious but far less lethal. \n\nAdditionally, it's important to protect higher risk groups that you might come in contact with; immunocompromised people, the elderly, etc. Even if you're not at significant risk by being sick, you could be putting somebody else at significant risk. Masking when sick and vaccination are still important for this reason.\n\nFinally, the climate with how many people actually have COVID nowadays is way different as well. This is probably thanks to the fact that so many people *are* vaccinated; not everybody has to as a result.\n\nIt's great that we've reached a point where the WHO says children are low-risk (and if you read further, still recommends vaccination if possible given a country's resources, etc). However, I think it's incredibly disingenuous to act like the conditions today are comparable to 3 years ago. So many factors have changed.\n\nAt the end of the day, I will still continue being vaccinated, even if I'm probably not going to die from getting infected. Same as the flu vaccine every year, etc. Regardless, being sick, isolating, etc. sucks- why not just get vaccinated and not worry about it? That's my thought process personally.\n\nHope I provided some perspective. I greatly disagree with your opinion and tone, but I'm more than happy to address things in a respectful and logical manner. Let me know if you have any questions :)\n\nAlso- curious as to your rationale for not getting vaccinated when it avoids sickness and is pretty painless to do?",

                    "comment": "1. The reason there is so many strains is partly because of the vaccine. You\u2019re not supposed to deploy a vaccine until the pandemic has runs it\u2019s course, we deployed it in the middle of it. Every other vaccine ever has been deployed after the major outbreaks. By deploying it in the middle, the virus was way more familiar with the vaccine and was able to mutate faster and more. Also everyone knew that new variants would come out, even in 2020. So stop acting like these new variants came out of nowhere and that\u2019s why the vaccine doesn\u2019t work. Either a) they thought the vaccine would work against all variants and they were stupid and wrong, or b) they knew the vaccine would only be effective against one strain, and they pushed lies anyway. They were not honest about the fact that this vaccine would be like a flu shot, why would I trust them?  Also, literally every virus ever becomes more infectious and less lethal over time, everyone knew that even in 2020. A virus, like any other life, wants to keep reproducing. It doesn\u2019t want to kill its host, it wants to spread. So of course it becomes more infectious and less deadly. People were saying that in 2020. \n\n2. I didn\u2019t get the vax because my age group (young men) were more likely to get myocarditis from the vax than to die from Covid. So I would have been putting myself at more risk by taking the vaccine. Statistically, it was safer for me not to get the vax because I would be at higher risk of getting myocarditis than dying from Covid. Two of my friends got myocarditis after their family forced them to get the vax. \n\nAlso, the vax doesn\u2019t protect against the spread or even getting sick. They have admitted that. So the notion that \u201cyou\u2019re protecting others\u201d is bs. The only thing the vax helps with is reducing hospitalization. So it doesn\u2019t protect others, it only protects the person who gets it. My parents got Covid a month after their vaccine and they never got it before that. Why would I get a vaccine that was developed in 9 months? Especially from companies that stand to profit a fuck ton for years and years. People who believed what the WHO and whatever other \u201cauthority\u201d got totally duped. Libs used to be skeptical of pharma and gov but idk what happened. Trump broke their brain",

The vaccine did nothing for young people. It didn\u2019t stop the spread. Covid, like every virus ever, mutated to become less deadly and more widespread. That is because a virus needs it\u2019s host to survive, and it wants to reproduce as much as possible. It doesn\u2019t make evolutionary sense for the virus to kill its host or evolve to kill more. It makes sense that it will become less deadly over time and more widespread. Covid would have become like the flu with or without the vaccine. \n\nAlso, I love how vax brains act like they knew Covid would become like the flu. No, you idiots were shitting ur pants in 2020-21 acting like Covid was gonna kill everyone if we let it spread. However, high IQ individuals like myself realized early on that by letting it spread, it would eventually become even less harmless. You guys shit on us for saying it\u2019s like the flu, but nowadays you guys want to act like you knew this was gonna happen and that this was the end goal for the vaccine. Just admit it, the vax didn\u2019t work like you thought it would, at all. And people like me who knew it was harmless knew it would end up like this. You only let go of your fear when your daddy Biden/ CDC or WHO says that pandemics over. The vaccine did little to nothing, and Covid ran its natural course. Now you guys act like you won. No you are just retarded",

Why is that not a great thing??? The less people are hospitalized, the more equipped hospitals are to handle other situations and emergencies. If the hospital has to deal with a ton of people who are sick, and can\u2019t deal with people who were injured in accidents etc, then not everyone can get treated (this actually happened in some places).\n\nAlso, why in the world would you not want to take steps to PREVENT HOSPITALIZATION??\n\nDo you wear a seatbelt? That\u2019s a way to prevent hospitalization, or reduce your risk of it. Do you pay attention to your sources of food to see if they\u2019ve passed inspection? That\u2019s a way to prevent hospitalization. Do you follow traffic laws? That\u2019s a way to avoid hospitalization. I could go on. Your logic just doesn\u2019t work here",

It\u2019s either the same or less risk of myocarditis from Covid vs the vax. \n\nBut even if it was more risky to get myocarditis Covid, that doesn\u2019t prove shit for your point. The vax doesn\u2019t stop the spread at all LOL. And there\u2019s evidence that the vax caused more variants, although your mainstream scientists haven\u2019t admitted that yet, maybe give it 3 years. Like the lab leak and this article, it takes them a couple years to admit their wrong LOL. \n\nBut even besides that, the fact that it doesn\u2019t stop the spread totally nullifies your point. So let\u2019s say you get the vax, which puts you at risk of myocarditis. Then, because the vaccine doesn\u2019t stop the spread, you get Covid. This puts you at risk for myocarditis. Now, because you took the vaccine and got Covid, you are doubly at risk for getting myocarditis. So by taking the vax you did in fact increase your risk for myocarditis. So whatever way you want to spin it, the vaccine increases your risk for myocarditis. You would be better off not getting the vaccine, and just getting Covid. You\u2019re natural immunity is stronger (mainstream finally admit this after a year or so), and it lasts longer than 6 months. You would be less at risk if you just got Covid and didn\u2019t get the vax. It doesn\u2019t stop the spread, the only thing it\u2019s good for is old/ fat/ unhealthy people. LOL fucking idiot.

I had a few questions i would really appreciate if someone can answer \n\n- how is diversity and inclusion on campus? as a minority i\u2019ve heard different points of view so i want to know how POC students experience the campus\n\n- is it possible to concentrate on business or even switch to business as a GRC student? \n\n- I have my eyes on the UC Davis Design program so would I be able to transfer to Davis for my junior yr? \n\n- What\u2019s your favorite thing about Cal Poly? \n\nthanks so much and sorry for so many questions!",

Changing majors here is much more of a bureaucratic pain in the ass than at other schools and it sounds like you're still not sure what you want to study. \n\nI ended up not being able to switch my major and was stuck in classes I didn't really like or care about to get a degree I won't use. \n\nFavorite thing about poly is SLO's access to nature. If you don't like the outdoors you will likely be bored here, and if you do, you'll love it.",

            "comment": "Hey! I had a few of these concerns going to Cal Poly as well, here\u2019s my own opinion-&gt;\n1. DEI wise, Cal Poly\u2019s faculty members and programs are super supportive and inclusive. There are many groups and clubs specifically to help POC members of our community. Ofc CP is known to not be as diverse as other colleges, but inclusivity is something CP strives for all the way. It really depends on who you surround yourself with. Also, as a freshman there are living communities that are POC oriented which can be helpful when it comes to transitioning. It can be a culture shock for some students, but never feel afraid to reach out, CP has a great freshman transition program.\n\n2. GRC to business shouldn\u2019t be too hard imo, but I will say the GRC program is superrrr good. There are concentrations that are design and business oriented, taking those extra business classes is a great perk when it comes to the design program. Make sure to check the GRC catalog for their concentrations. More info here: http://www.grc.calpoly.edu/students/concentrations\nAs a packaging major, I totally recommend packaging design, it mixes bus and graphic design and we have a career fair just for us in the winter quarter\ud83e\udef6\n\nAlso! Minoring in business is an option!! Not too hard to implement into your schedule/flowchart.\n\n3. If you\u2019re dead set on going to Davis, do the Community College route for sure-don\u2019t spend money on a program you\u2019re not going to enjoy. It\u2019s super important to consider this as it will be more difficult to get the GPA you need to transfer as a full time CP student than a CC transfer.\n\n4. My fav thing about CP academic wise is all the hands on approach to everything! You learn very little theory and the classes are much more in-line with your career goals. CP is less research and more doing, which is super helpful for a visual learner (like me)!\n\nBesides academics, I love the college town as well as the nature! There are beaches and parks everywhere and the transit system is nice imo. There is an arboretum on campus and it\u2019s beautiful! I love the hiking spots around here- great if you\u2019re an active individual or even if you just like to chill outside \n\nThat\u2019s it! Feel free to reach out if you have questions. I personally love CP, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love wherever you end up choosing!",

I don't think it would be too challenging to switch into business from GrC, but the GrC program is amazing. Its one a few GrC programs in the country and is well known in the industry. Graduates are highly sought after by companies (especially for more businessy roles like you seem interested in). One of the GrC concentrations you can choose to pursue is in management and this concentration means you get to take more business classes. While I'm not a management concentration, I've also had the opportunity to take  multiple business classes. You can also go for a business minor if the management concentration isn't enough. I have friends doing this and they say the classes complement the GrC classes well. Good luck with whatever path you choose!",

I kinda just interpreted it as like \u201cthey\u2019re different and idk how to interact with them,\u201d but you can\u2019t help but notice it. Culture shock for sures\n\nThe majority of people aren\u2019t outright racist, but the micro aggressions are prevalent. After a while you kinda jus deal with it (which is morbid to say) but I learned to just let it be. Most people have good intentions, so I approached interactions like such with that in my mind\n\nJust find a good group of people you can rely on and you\u2019ll be set, whether it\u2019s dorming or connections w cultural clubs. You\u2019ll be fine !!",

I can't speak from personal experience as I'm not a POC, but I never saw any of the GrC tribe being weird or rude to our classmates of color.\n\nThere is also a concentration in GrC that is business and management focused, so that might be a good fit for your without needing to swap majors. The folks in that concentration often go on to work at big tech companies in the Bay.",

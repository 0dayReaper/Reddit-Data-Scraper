    "postText": "I'm still on the mechanical engineering waitlist at Cal Poly SLO for fall 2023. I know the chances are slim (3ish% I think) of coming off the list, so I'm also planning for a 1-year transfer from CC. I'm heading into college with about a year's worth of college courses and APs, and I'll need to start this summer so that I have 3 semesters to complete some of the course sequences (Physics 1, 2, and 3 for example). There are a couple of courses listed as REQUIRED for transfer to Cal Poly SLO that I haven't been able to find offered locally or online. For those that transferred in, did you have all of the required courses completed by the end of spring?  I have seen a few posts from other transfer students who did not have all the required courses, yet were still admitted. I'm hoping this is the case.",

A friend of mine at my cc didn't check the updated requirements for his aerospace engr transfer and they updated the English courses on the required classes, sure enough, he was not admitted because he was going based on last year's required transfer courses.",

Leaving me pretty behind cause I still needed circuits and then the classes I withdrew from. They rescinded my admission.\nSo I stayed, retook everything and more and was admitted for this fall. So yeah, I did have all the required courses. I actually think all of the recommended as well because my school offered dynamics during this past year. \nMy look on it was I wasn\u2019t sure if I would get into Cal Poly again but I figured it wasn\u2019t hurting to just take everything I could. It was def worth it. \nI\u2019m not sure how they determine whether it\u2019s fine you don\u2019t have all the requirements tbh but that\u2019s just my personal experience. Rooting for ya",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I built [polymapper.com](https://polymapper.com) and I hope it comes in handy when trying to find classrooms.\n\nPolyMapper is a website where you can search for your classes by section (e.g. [COMS 101-13](https://polymapper.com/sections/5012)) or room (e.g. [14-301](https://polymapper.com/classrooms/140301)) and view it on a pretty map. It'll tell you exactly where that room is inside the building too! Feel free to bookmark or save links to classrooms to help you quickly find your class on the first day.\n\nLike the usual map, you can also search for buildings by number or name. Ever wanted to know where the Student Experimental Farm, Recreational Flight Range, or Seismic Lab is? Just look it up :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Cal Poly has precise location data for 3,945 sections and classrooms. Theres a very very small chance though that your classroom or section isn't listed. In this unlikely event, just look it up by building like usual.",

Sometimes I know the room number, like 186-123, but it tells me nothing - especially not the location of the room in what might be a big building (think the new Science building, or the spider building).\n\n[Edit] I see that this functionality is already there, but only for a subset of locations on campus that actually are used as classrooms. Do you plan on expanding it to find any room (e.g., a professor's office?)",

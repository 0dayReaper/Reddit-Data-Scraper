All 3 were working in unrelated fields.\n\nFrom what I've seen in my accounting-based observations, there is currently less real estate acquisition / development activity owing to the interest rate trend. And I'm seeing mergers &amp; acquisitions departments contract a little within some of the bigger firms. Still, it seems like a solid choice. \n\nIf I hadn't picked accounting, I would have picked real estate. But everyone is different. You might love marketing. You might not. Same for real estate.\n\nWhat classes in either field have you taken?",

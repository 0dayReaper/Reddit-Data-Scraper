Definitely preferred them to California west.  They did raise rent each lease cycle, but thats unfortunately pretty typical. Issues with the property though were always addressed quickly and in favor of the tenant.",

Those apartment have so much mold it\u2019s disgusting and unhealthy. I started getting sick and left my lease early because of it. San Luis Property Management didn\u2019t give me any pushback with breaking my lease due to the mold, so that was nice. However, when I was moving out, I chatted with some neighbors and turns out all of the units in that complex have a mold problem - so I\u2019d just advise to stay away from those units.",

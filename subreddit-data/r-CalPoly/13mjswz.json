    "postText": "Hey all, I've pushed off taking Area C GE classes and now I'll be entering my senior year and still have the C1, C2, C Elective, Upper C, aaaaaand GE Area C/D Elective to take, on top of major courses. Super great!!!! \ud83d\ude0d\n\nMy main reason for pushing them off is that every class I've searched up has no reviews/input on Reddit or PolyRatings.. or it's flat out impossible to get into. I have priority registration so hopefully for some of those difficult to get into classes, I'll be the first person sat on the waitlist.\n\nPlease drop your recommendations for any Area C's that I can take @ Cal Poly and why you liked the course/if its was easy or naur. I've noticed most posts suggest taking them at Foothill or Cuesta which I'm trying to do to some degree over summer but not looking to get all of them done there as I'll be working full time.\n\nAny help is much appreciated!!",

I *barely* got a B- and it wasn't for lack of effort. \n\nI hear sculpture is fun \n\nArchitecture history or something with Choi? I believe, it's been a few years but he was an amazing professor. \n\nWhen you do your upper division C, make sure it also fills your gwr \n\nI've heard one of the teachers for corporate communication is really good. Forget her name but I saw it on here so it should be searchable.",

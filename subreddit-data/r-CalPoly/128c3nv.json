            "comment": "I remember hearing people talk about GPA requirements to change majors within CENG and in that conversation it was the same for Mech and for Aero (like 3.6 or something idk it was a rumor). Aero seemed harder to me since it has more high level math classes reskinned as major courses, but I only took the 200 level Mech classes so I'm biased. Those 200 level Mech classes were also the hardest classes for a number of people I knew but it was mostly bad professors and them just having high workloads. An advantage of Mech is more flexibility with your concentration since Aero only has two",

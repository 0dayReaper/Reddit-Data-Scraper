    "postText": "Hi Mustangs!!\n\nI was recently admitted to the class of 27 as an incoming freshman and couldn't be happier about potentially coming to SLO. That said, I am concerned about conditional acceptance.\n\nWhen I submitted my application for my community college courses in early November, I listed a course as planned/in progress for the spring 2023 semester. \n\nHowever, since then, I've been unable to register for the class at the community college as it's filled up before I could even sign up or register for the waitlist. As a result, I've begun looking for alternative courses at different community colleges and online A-G-approved courses (ex. UC scout).\n\nAssuming I can take these classes, is there a high chance I will get rescinded? Any insight would be appreciated!",

If it\u2019s calculus, it might affect you. However, what you should do is contact the admissions office ASAP and tell them the situation. They\u2019ll send you a scary email saying they need to re-evaluate your application in light of this new info and it might end in rescinding it, but it likely won\u2019t. Better to find out now rather than in mid-July after you submit your final transcript.",

    "postText": "I was accepted to both schools for computer science but I am torn between them. On one hand Uc riverside is 20 min from my house and would be free. For calppoly I would have to dorm and would cost my family 6k a year out of pocket. I heard that calppoly is a great engineering school, so i wonder if it would give me better opportunities for intern ships and a job after graduation compared to riverside. Or is that not the case? Which is better worth it? Thank you!",

Cal Poly has a much better career fair which makes it easier to land internships / jobs. And the small class size is nice, intro classes at ucr are 100+ people so most of the time you will be talking with TAs in office hours. 6k / year is a worthwhile investment for a CS degree imo.",

I agree that Cal Poly has better opportunities, but it won't be impossible to network and advocate for yourself and do great when you are close to home and having free schooling. If it being free isn't too big of a deal for you, Cal Poly could be considered for the better class sizes and opportunities, for most other aspects I'd personally go with UCR.",

For some people it is a great learning experience, for others they don't rly need that extra step to reach greater independence and get more out of life, this was my own experience, though being on campus had some of its benefits. And though it might cover for itself, it's about how OP values it.

Also, if you are considering staying home, why not save a lot by just taking your GEs at a local CC, then transferring to a school like Cal Poly later.",

If you have a spot in your home and it\u2019s easier for your family and you\u2019re not incurring debt that can be huge so if it\u2019s a better situation for you and your family that you stay in your home and don\u2019t move away, that\u2019s OK. Remember that it\u2019s not only the 6K that you would be spending but like transportation and buying all the stuff that you need for a dorm and time and energy. It all adds up to a lot more than 6K.

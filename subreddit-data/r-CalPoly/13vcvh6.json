    "postText": "Hi everyone! Me and 3 other roommates are looking for 1 other or 2 people who would be willing to share a room in our current lease. The shared room has a balcony, a private bathroom and a fireplace! Its about a 10 minute bike ride from campus or a 5ish minute drive to campus. We have a huge backyard so if you a big green thumb or enjoy any outdoor yard activities, we got you. My roommates and I are all girls in CLA and will all be 3rd years next year. We are totally open to any gender, major, personality, etc. that would be interested in living with us! Please don't hesitate to reach out for more information/pictures of the place and also if you would like to meet up sometime to discuss the living situation more in-depth!",

Recruiters are going to look at your internships more than anything else. \n\nHelps if you join a Silicon Valley company with a branch office on the east coast. They\u2019ll know their West coast schools.\n\nEast Coast has a lot more small colleges so the recruiters have their work cut out for them. \n\nBoston was the original high tech hub (route 128) but their button up culture and enforcement of non-compete clauses (illegal in CA) caused them to lose the startup scene to Silicon Valley.",

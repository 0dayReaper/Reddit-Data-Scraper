And they put out their first episode recently: https://youtu.be/_d90cvHghA8\n\nI know this is a very niche topic, but I was wondering if anyone wants to do Cal Poly Survivor Edgic with me (see /r/edgic for more info on what Edgic is) and try to predict who will win the season? It\u2019s basically like you analyze the video editors choices to figure out who you think will win. I don\u2019t know how applicable general survivor edgic will be to Cal Poly Survivor but I\u2019m a huge survivor nerd and don\u2019t really know where else to post about this lol",

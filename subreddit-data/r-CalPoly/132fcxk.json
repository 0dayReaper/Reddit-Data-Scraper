Where are the best bulletin boards (offline or online) in SLO and around Cal Poly to find a short term rental? I am mostly interested in off campus student housing or places offered locally (not Airbnb, Vrbo etc.).",

I believe there\u2019s a Cal Poly housing Facebook group, and sometimes stuff pops up on reddit.",

It\u2019s just ridiculous to keep kids waiting for weeks and weeks after their peers have been accepted. As a family, we just want to decide already, as he got in nearly everywhere else he applied. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s a rejection or possibly waitlist at this point, so if he is accepted, the school hasn\u2019t done themselves (or their yield) any favors, as he\u2019s mentally moved on to one of the schools that accepted him months ago.",

I think this waiting game they are playing with the emotions of the students and parents and not good for their overall reputation.   We have heard most that haven\u2019t heard have mentally moved on as well and are excited about a school that said YES WE WANT YOU right away, definitely better than \u201cno determination made yet\u201d.",

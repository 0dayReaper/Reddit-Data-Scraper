    "postText": "My daughters a junior and her dream school is Cal Poly. I think her weighted GPA is somewhere btwn 4.4 and 4.5. She's taken 6 AP classes so far including Calc, AP Bio, AP Physics I. I keep hearing from other parents it's almost like a lottery ar Cal Poly - i.e., just because you have good grades it doesn't mean you can get in. If you got accepted fo bio or bio chem, can you tell me what your GPA was? Thank you so much.",

Be sure to apply to other good chem schools as well: UCSD, Cal, &amp; CalTech.\n\nCalpoly's Chem dept is known for their material sciences. Anything they can do to beef up their extracurriculars in this area would likely get noticed. https://chemistry.calpoly.edu/content/academics/undergraduate-program",

            "comment": "If you are very worried about getting an acceptance, I would look closely at which major is more impacted and consider switching into the more impacted after coming to cal poly. I believe, not entirely sure though, that biochem is not AS impacted as bio, so if you apply biochem and aren't enjoying it , you could switch majors to Bio. Changing majors within the College of Science and Math is very easy as long as you are not failing classes. That being said, I got into bio off of the waitlist with a 4.2 weighted GPA, 33 ACT, and 7 APs. It really depends on how many other students are applying and changes quite a bit year to year.",

Personally, my GPA was not that high with a 3.78 unweighted and a 4.15 weighted, so I would assume your daughter has a good chance. My biggest suggestion would be to make sure she works a job that relates to her major, as I got lots of extra points for having 16-20 job hours a week in my major, taking calculus, and having a leadership role at school (all questions they ask which give you extra points in the admissions process).",

I'd never let my daughter lie but I just find it odd...she's the president of ASB, volunteers/tutors/works part time. I'm hoping that gives her a slightly better chance\ud83d\ude4f she'll be applying to out of state public schools under the WUE program as well. Such a bummer a qualified applicant can't simply get accepted to a public college of your choice.",

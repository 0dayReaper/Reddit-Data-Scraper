    "postText": "I\u2019m a business major thinking about going into marketing (?) (maybe with a minor in psych?). Can a business major lmk what the business program is like? Will I be able to get internship/networking opportunities compared to USC or UCLA? Ppl have mentioned how jobs love the \u201clearn by doing\u201d philosophy but is that really better than going to a prestigious college?\n\nI\u2019m also an asian girl so I am also taking that into consideration (due to lack of diversity). It would also help if someone could share their experience at slo (location, student life, education, anything really).\n\nThank you all in advance! Appreciate it :)",

California schools are too expensive for the education they provide, so pick the one you can graduate in four years and get the internship lined up.",

Tour the campuses to see which speak to you. There is definitely a greater level of diversity at UCLA. USC reputation has surged recently but both are considered top tier schools.",

I have a lot of friends who are business majors and have done great summer internships (stuff in NYC, with T50 companies, etc) and have taken great classes. \n\nCal Poly is prestigious for a business degree, mostly in CA; if you plan on staying in the west after graduation, then a Cal Poly business degree is very much worth something! Companies love cal poly grads because of the learn by doing approach and great professional experiences they tend to have. If you want to try the traditional 4 year college experience, Cal Poly is a great choice :) tour and talk to more people and see if it sounds like what you want out of college! If it works for your budget and will not put you in a great amount of debt, go for it.\n\nFor diversity, I am white so I am not best person to speak on it, however Cal Poly has a really thriving community of Asian interest clubs and fraternities, as well as many other organizations and student clubs that are diverse. Cal Poly is a PWI and I cannot speak to the adverse experiences faced by Asians on campus, but from my knowledge and friend\u2019s experiences, there are lot of ways to find community and belonging on campus. \n\nI hope your college decision goes well! Consider what you want out of college, because college is ultimately what you make of it. There is a lot you can do at cal poly as a business undergrad, but if you love UCLA and USC, don\u2019t give up on that. :)\n\nEdit: a word",

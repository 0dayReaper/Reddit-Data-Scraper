    "postText": "what has your experience as a transfer been like (specifically as a poc lol). I have been to SLO a handful of times and think its a great little town, but obviously I have not lived there as a college student. How is the social life? Are the professors nice and easy to communicate with? Is it easy to make friends? I would ask about diversity on campus, but I am aware that SLO is not very diverse. I am a business major, so anything related to that would help too. thanks!",

I\u2019ve had a great experience so far except getting class schedules I want, but that\u2019s difficult for every major from my understanding. My professors have been great so far and easy to communicate with. It\u2019s definitely a mostly white campus, but there are other ethnic groups on campus. It\u2019s actually easy to make friends as a transfer because at WOW week you get to meet with other transfers in your major and you can end up in a lot of the same classes together so it\u2019s starts you off with a good basis for friendship, at least in my experience. I\u2019m also friends with people from my WOW group that aren\u2019t in my major which is pretty cool.",

There are a lot of resources and the professors genuinely care about your success and will take the time to answer any questions you have. It\u2019s a predominantly white campus but I found my classes to be pretty mixed and a lot of different voices were brought into discussions because of the diversity in the classroom. I specifically concentrated in Marketing Management and the only negative thing I would say was the lack of professors for that department. You\u2019ll have the same professors twice more than likely but other than that it\u2019s fine. You meet tons of new people through WOW and clubs on campus. Just have an open mind and don\u2019t be afraid to introduce yourself, it\u2019s scary transferring as a third year but everyone has been chill in my experience.",

I would highly recommend getting involved in Cal Poly's - Center for Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship program through the Hatchery. There are some amazing students and professors that want the best for everyone involved.   \n\n\nHere's a link to learn more: [https://cie.calpoly.edu/](https://cie.calpoly.edu/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, I recently graduated and am still here in SLO working closely with the university!",

And just found out that I will be transferring and making my way back to attend Cal Poly. I don\u2019t know much about the school for POC aside from hearing that they have made great strides to make it a much better experience for POC. I don\u2019t think that you have much to worry about.",

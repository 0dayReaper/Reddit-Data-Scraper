Examples of their work are on UM\u2019s YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/@unitedmvmtslo\nThere are plenty of technical roles; no dancing needed (but hey, also nothing stopping you from learning to dance with UM along the way)\u2014\nhttps://forms.gle/7EWY2A6TRmU9T2Cg8",

            "comment": "If you are interested in creating a short film the only place I know you could do that is through the MAST  or photo/video minor. You take two classes in the ISLA dept on screenwriting and then film production where you create a short film for the SLO film fest in groups. If you are into making movies definitely check that out, the professors recommend great film opportunities. I think there is also a women in film and television club too but don't know how active they are.",

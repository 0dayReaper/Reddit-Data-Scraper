CR-2032 is pretty standard and easy enough to swap out.\n\nYou can try Coastal Computers.\nhttps://ccslo.com/\n\nYou might be better off just using your educational discount at the bookstore or downtown Apple store or BestBuy and picking up a machine today.\n\nCampus computer labs are also an option.\nhttps://lib.calpoly.edu/study-spaces-and-tech/computers/",

Depending on the age it may be better to get another one instead of going through the hassle of replacing the batter as it\u2019s not removable. A computer repair shop may have the part but they may have to order it, so it will take a few days.\n\nGenerally this should cost around $150 to $200 with labor",

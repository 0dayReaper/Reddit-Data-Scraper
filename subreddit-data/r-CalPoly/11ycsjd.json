I would pick it over PCV, but here are the pros and cons. \nPros:\nMore affordable\nYou have a garbage disposal\nIt\u2019s the only dorm that doesn\u2019t require the fire marshal to turn off the fire alarm\nCloser to campus\nAll rooms are singles\n\nCons: \nLess secure-only need keycard to get into your apartment. PCV uses keycard to get into building and apartment. \nResidential parking is at PCV parking garages\nPCV has the post office and some fast food places",

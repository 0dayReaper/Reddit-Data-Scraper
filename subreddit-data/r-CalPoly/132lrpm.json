Once you have it there are a lot of jobs and internships that would open up. https://www.cuesta.edu/academics/scimath/nah/alliedhealthdept/phleb-info/index.html#:~:text=Phlebotomy%20information-,Phlebotomy,-Phlebotomy%20Program%20Information\n\nIf you are returning back home this Summer you might look for Phlebotomy certification and internship opportunities there too. There are also private certifications that are a lot faster, but more expensive.",

            "comment": "CPE at UCI is a little different than CS/SWE at cal poly. A few of my friends went to UCI as computer engineering majors. Unlike poly, where the CPE major shares classes between EE and CS, the CPE program there has its own circuits and CS classes. This has some key advantages. If you want to have a career in CPEs core paths (embedded, computer architecture, robotics systems, etc), the classes at UCI are 100% tailored to that. However, you\u2019ll have less exposure to full EE and full CS like at cal poly. SWE at poly is an engineering focused CS degree. It\u2019s very flexible, since one can fairly easily transfer to CS or CPE if you decide those majors better fit your goals. Honestly, I can\u2019t give anymore advice unless you let us know what you\u2019re interested in. Do you like hardware? Software? Not sure?",

            "comment": "Compare flowcharts for each major accepted to at Cal Poly and UCI and see which classes interest you most.  I would say Cal Poly all the way for SWE because of the hands on, small class size, no TAs, industry connections/reputation, SWE majors have the highest starting salary of all majors at SLO and the central coast college vibe beach town experience you will get.  Also, for the new The Noyce School of Applied Computing that is being put in place.\n\nhttps://calpolynews.calpoly.edu/news_releases/2022/June/%20Noyce",

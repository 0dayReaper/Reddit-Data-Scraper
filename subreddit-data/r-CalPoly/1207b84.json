    "postText": "Anyone know how the appealing process works? I\u2019m a transfer student and I had a lot of health problems that made me have to retake classes and accept lower grades than I could have gotten. That being said, my major gpa is still like a 3.4 and I will have completed all the required and desired courses for my major at the end of this semester. I haven\u2019t heard anything yet so I\u2019m assuming I\u2019m getting rejected. I\u2019m wondering mostly about the time frame of it; when would I hear back about my appeal? Is there any real chance of them changing their determination? \n\nThanks.",

    "postText": "Dear avid league player,\n\nFirst I would like to mention that it may not be league that you are playing, I am going off of context clues based on what you are saying. I am writing to inform you that the buildings and road carry sound very well I believe that you are in Bishop but maybe Romauldo. Your screams at your computer can be heard by anyone that is outside or chooses to have their window open.  Especially I would like to point your attention to your \"ohhhhh gimme that, gimme that\" outbursts could be confused by a passer-by as to be something that it is not, as a passer-by has not had the past two hours of listening to provide context to what is going on in your room.  I am very excited for you that finals do not seem to be a stressor in your life but many of us are trying to study and would appreciate it if you are aware of your fellow students and mind your volume.\n\nThank you,\n\nFolded\\_Melon",

Your screams are echoing through the buildings and roads like a symphony of chaos. Now, I ain't Sherlock Holmes, but based on the clues you're hollering, I can only assume you're knee-deep in League. So here's my open letter, just for you.  \nPicture this: I'm betting you're holed up in Bishop, or maybe Romauldo. Doesn't matter, 'cause your wild antics can be heard by everyone in the vicinity. It's like a free audio show for all the peeps passing by or those unfortunate souls who dare leave their windows open. Oh, and let me not forget those infamous \"ohhhhh gimme that, gimme that\" outbursts of yours. They're so intense that they could easily confuse an innocent bystander who hasn't been subjected to the eardrum assault of the past two hours. You feel me?  \nNow, don't get me wrong. I'm thrilled that finals don't seem to be stressing you out. Kudos, my dude! But here's the thing: the rest of us mere mortals are trying to study, to grind, to hustle. We're just trying to keep our sanity intact while you unleash your gaming fury. So, if you could do us a solid and be aware of your fellow students, that'd be grand. Mind your volume, my friend.  \nWith love and a touch of exasperation,  \nFolded\\_Melon",

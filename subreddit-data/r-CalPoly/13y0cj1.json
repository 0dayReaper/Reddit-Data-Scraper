            "comment": "Worst is subjective, but I would recommend avoiding agbo. Lovely guy but it\u2019s hard to communicate with him outside of class and coordinate any sort of assistance. Many times he isn\u2019t at his own office hours. He also speaks with a very soft voice that makes it difficult to understand him during lecture, in combination with his strong accent. Favorites? Vyas, taufik, nafisi, lots of good EE profs.",

He\u2019s incredible and has a good reputation in industry for power electronics. \n\nI also really liked mckell (not sure if that\u2019s spelled right). His classes are very hard, but he teaches pretty well and was helpful in office hours. Not sure what he teaches now, but I had him for controls back in 2016 or so",

Also felt like he didn\u2019t know what was going on, like ever.\n\nArakaki and McKell are tough ass professors but you\u2019ll def get the full content and learn a lot.\n\nI liked McKell because he was very helpful in answering questions and wouldn\u2019t belittle you. I think his grading and policies were pretty fair too. Emphasis on fair because he wasn\u2019t lenient with late work or free grades type of thing but it made sense to me.\n\nI had Arakaki for my senior project so I\u2019m not too sure what he\u2019s like in class but my friends described him as a man very engrossed in his work. Ie, just scribbling on the whiteboard the whole time and thinking to himself. Though I\u2019ve heard his tests are very hard so don\u2019t expect to easily get an A or B in his classes. Really really gotta work for it if you\u2019re into that",

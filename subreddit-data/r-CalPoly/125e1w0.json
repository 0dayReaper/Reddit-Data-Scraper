    "postText": "Why are professors allowed to not report to students their grades for the final exam? Instead, only the final letter grade is posted to student center. I have noticed this especially by professors in the mathematics department and it can get a bit annoying. I\u2019m sure that I could email after the letter grades go in to know my score on the final exam, but I feel that informing students of the grades they earn on any assignment should be standard.",

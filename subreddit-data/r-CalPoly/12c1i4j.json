This is extremely inappropriate behavior, threatening someone\u2019s paid education for class materials that can be sourced elsewhere. The complete opposite of cal polys goal which is to teach resourcefulness.",

This doesn't really make any sense to me, but I didn't want any trouble in the class in the future so I just bought it from him.",

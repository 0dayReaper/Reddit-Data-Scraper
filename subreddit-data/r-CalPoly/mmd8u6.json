I can't offer all too much directly as I'm no longer in the area but I share your concern and understanding as an alum that identifies as AAPI, and as someone who was also a victim of a hate crime within the city of SLO by someone I suspect of being a student. I wish I could be more supportive than also saying that I know how you feel being uncomfortable being somewhere you can't feel safe at. It's a damn shame that these things happen to begin with, much less the invisibility of issues from Asian Americans who've been struggling for quite some time even before the hate crimes started becoming a massive problem.  \n\n\nI know others have suggested that you should contact the media but if you decide not to, I would implore that you do report it to [Stop AAPI Hate](https://stopaapihate.org/), since they've been documenting the surge in hate crimes. From what I've seen since following the org for the last few months, it seems like their reporting is anonymous, and it would at the very least help them get a fuller picture of the Asian hate that's been such a problem. If you don't report it, I understand why and fully support it, I hope that there's another place where you can work out where they will be less tolerable of that nonsense. :(",

The media seems to omit who's attacking who - just makes it hard to track down the offender if we don't know their race and seems weird how media blurs out the criminals face.   As you know pf has cameras open anpolice report.  They keep tapes for 30 days on hard drive.  You can have law  investigate your claims put it in writing so there is a record.  Then if cops find it's got merit based on your claims and other witnesses  on camera you can press charges.",

I know going to planet fitness may be saving you money,but a lot of weirdos and high brow losers workout at those kind of gyms. I don\u2019t know how u could be intimidated by people at Planet Fitness because if you look too buff they kick u out. I really recommend Kennedy or Club 24. Everyone is super sweet there and you will make friends with the employees and gym people in no time. Also,the Calpoly rec center should be opening up more by the start of September too.",

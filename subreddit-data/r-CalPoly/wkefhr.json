    "postText": "**\ud83c\udf34 Hey Cal Poly! \ud83c\udf34**\n\nEvery single Week of Welcome (WOW) thousands of new students experience what SLO has to offer. This is made possible by nearly 400 WOW leaders that put in countless hours all to welcome 5,000 Freshman and transfer students to our community.\n\n**The Problem**\n\n*Being a WOW leader is TOUGH! Our leaders often face the following:*\n\n* Hundreds of hours planning and being up from early morning to late nights\n* Spending their own money on activities to provide that next-level experience\n* Organizing transportation for +25 WOWIEZ can be impossible!\n* Without transportation, many groups  can't do everything they want to do\n\n**\ud83d\ude99  The Solution \ud83d\ude99**\n\n*We're connecting Cal Poly student drivers with WOW groups so they can help:*\n\n* Welcome new students to SLO\n* Give back to the students that make this possible, our WOW leaders\n* Get face time with and recruit members for your student organizations\n* Earn service hours for helping out!\n* Get some gas $$$!\n\n**If This Sounds Like Something You're Interested In...**\n\n[Please fill out this interest list as it will help us gauge how many student drivers we'll be able to provide for our WOW leaders.](https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cvDr7SSlk9XZM58) *If you're a part of a club or organization that might want to join in on this for service hours or just to give back then please send this post to them or contact me and I can reach out directly!*\n\nTLDR; WOW leaders are the real MVPs and we're organizing student drivers to help WOWIEZ get to and from their WOW activities!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(DISCLAIMER: we are not employed by New Student Transition Programs or its affiliates, we're [Ryde Carpool](https://www.rydecarpool.com/about) and we are organizing student drivers for WOW leaders.)",

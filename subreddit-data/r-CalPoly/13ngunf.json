    "postText": "Hey, \n\nThis fall I'll be transferring to CPSLO as a junior. How/when do I sign up for classes? I logged into my Cal Poly portal, went to the \"Student Center\" page, and see this hyperlink \"Degree Planner,\" but when I click on it I get this page that says \"Authorization Error -- Contact your Security Administrator.\" Maybe I just have to wait? Or should I contact someone? Any advice/insight would be much appreciated. I'm excited to be going to school with you all next semester.",

Sometimes classes are only offered in a particular quarter.\n\nAlso, make sure you have your shopping cart ready and click submit the second reg goes live. It's a competition. Have plan b and plan c and plan d schedules ready to go if you don't get the classes you want on the first shot. \n\nWaitlist. I've personally seen someone #16 on the list get in to a full class. It was her persistence that paid off. She kept crashing the class, people kept dropping or not showing up and she got in! Extreme case, but it can happen!\n\nResearch the professors. It can make a difference! I tried several quarters to get one particular professor and finally got in to her class. I am glad I did. That professor saved my life basically. \n\nHere is a [map of the floor plans for every building](https://afd.calpoly.edu/facilities/campus-maps/building-floor-plans/)\n\nCongrats on getting in to Cal Poly! Awesome school with lots of good people! Make sure you start meeting people and exchanging phone numbers/social medias on day one. Wishing you all the best.",

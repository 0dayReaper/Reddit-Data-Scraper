    "postText": "hii so i\u2019m an incoming freshman and also a first gen student. im still a little confused on how housing works (despite reading the website). i\u2019m gonna be in cal poly scholars and have 3 potential people i can live with and we were thinking about it being the 4 of us but i don\u2019t think there\u2019s gonna be any quads? we were also thinking maybe split up into two and two and then either try to get doubles or find a third person each for a triple ? but also i\u2019ve heard there are very few doubles which leads to my next question\u2026.\n\non the housing application, i guess you\u2019re only allowed to pick up to two people ? if you only pick one person, what happens if you end up getting a triple? \n\nis that how it works ? how does the whole random assigning thing go ? if someone can just briefly the whole process i would really really appreciate it. i know my questions are so stupid but i\u2019m just confused.",

            "comment": "hi! congrats on getting in :) i didn\u2019t live on campus as a freshman but hopefully I can try to give you some info to help. First of all, if you only pick one person and end up getting a triple, that other person will most likely be randomly assigned. I think splitting up into groups would be the best way to go about your situation! I would advise you put down one person and you would either get a double room or find someone to be in your triple or get someone random. I hope this helps a little I know everything is confusing",

            "comment": "You can only pick two people for your roommate group because most rooms are triples. If you only pick one and then get a triple you'll be given a random. If you do two groups of two, there's a pretty low chance of your room selection appointments being close enough to coordinate getting the same room. Rooms go fast, there are very few doubles and quads. You could always just split into two groups and take triples with randoms. Randoms are just people that don't have a roommate group, which is most people for first year housing, randoms are assigned a room selection appointment just like groups and they can select any available bed in any room, including rooms that are partially occupied by a group. No one is assigned a room, unless there's some sort of extenuating circumstance, you're assigned a room selection appointment and pick a room when your appointment comes.",

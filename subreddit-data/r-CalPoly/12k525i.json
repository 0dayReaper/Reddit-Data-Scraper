    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted some advice on my transfer plan as a business admin student.\n\nI currently live and go to cc in the Bay Area as a first year, but my top school is SLO at the moment. So far, I have pretty much all As, except for last semester when I got a C in chem. After this semester, I'll be at around 3.6-3.7. I want to heighten my chances of getting into cal poly slo, so I want to go to Cuesta College next semester but fully online since I don't have the means for housing there yet. To SLO students who came from Cuesta and current Cuesta students-- Is this a good idea? Are the online courses at Cuesta good? Any advice will help, thanks!!",

Many of the students at cuesta are people who moved there to get in to poly. It\u2019s a great route if that\u2019s the school you\u2019re dedicated to attending. My one friend who didn\u2019t do it went to MIT from cuesta lol.\n\nGood luck op!\n\nCuesta was a great school.\n\nJust fyi though: in order to make it count as your primary CC you need a certain # of your units to be from that school. I don\u2019t remember the number it just came up in my application to poly. You won\u2019t be able to do it online. You\u2019ll have to move to slo",

Last I heard, the AAT degrees at Cuesta will transfer to CSU Channel Islands for automatic acceptance, but Cal Poly draws from all over the state &amp; doesn't have an automatic placement agreement with Cuesta. Having said that, there are more transfer students from Cuesta and Hancock than any other CCCs at Cal Poly, and some faculty teach at both Cuesta &amp; Cal Poly so you'll see some familiar names between the campuses. Best of luck to you!",

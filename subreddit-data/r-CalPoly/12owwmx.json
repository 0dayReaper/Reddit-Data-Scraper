    "postText": "I am currently torn between UC Berkeley and Cal Poly. I want to be a lawyer, and applied to Cal Poly under the communications major. I loved CP when I toured and love the coms program, but find it difficult to turn down Berkeley, especially since I want to attend top law school after graduation. Why should I choose Cal Poly over Berkeley?",

If you like the quiet coast and want to enjoy more direct outdoor things like hiking and surfing at Monta\u00f1a De Oro, then you'd be pretty happy at Cal Poly. But if prestige and maybe more access to direct job opportunities are important to you then Berkeley again :-)",

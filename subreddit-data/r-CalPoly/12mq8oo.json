Most of the food should be provided but idk if any of it has changed. You will be assigned to a host who will more than likely live on campus so they can give you a glimpse into what dorm life looks like. And I think they may take you downtown? At least they took us when I went a few years back. Just remember to pack anything you\u2019ll need for overnight stay. Have fun!!",

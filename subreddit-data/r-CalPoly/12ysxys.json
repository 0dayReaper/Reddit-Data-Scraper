    "postText": "I'm a first-year international student and I'm going for the second 5-week session starting 31st July.  Most of my classes seem to be asynchronous so I was wondering if it's worth it to stay on campus and take classes or just go home and do it from there. What's the atmosphere like during summer? Are there usually a lot of students on campus or is it completely isolated? What about campus dining?",

There will be students on campus but nothing like the normal school year, I would say around 75% of the population is gone. \n\nIf I recall correctly they kept a few dining areas open during the summer, but a lot of stuff shuts down.",

It\u2019s nice being there and things being emptier to do things.\n\nAlso you get credits out of the way!\n\nI wish I spent more summers there. \n\nThe caveat for you is likely that you\u2019re only a first year, it definitely helps if you already signed a year lease at a house and can just stay at the house you\u2019ve been in it instead of moving into one from a dorm.",

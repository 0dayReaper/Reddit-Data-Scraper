    "postText": "I\u2019m a first year biochem major and fall quarter I failed Chem 124 and my GPA ended up being a 1.75, putting me on academic probation. I\u2019m also a cal poly scholar so I was very afraid of losing my scholarship and my standing. I honestly really tried this quarter to get my grades up and I even went from taking 18 units fall quarter to only taking 14 winter quarter, one of those classes being retaking Chem 124 to fix my gpa. I thought I was doing well but I ended up with a D in Chem which is embarrassing because I already took it once and i found out that I also failed Calc 1 and I don\u2019t even know with what percent because my final grade was never posted on canvas. So now my GPA is listed as like a 1.54 which is even worse than before. I want to change majors and I desperately want to get out of stem or at the very least biochem but I don\u2019t know where to start especially with my already fucked GPA. I have meetings scheduled with advisors and whatnot but I just genuinely feel pretty hopeless about it at this point because I really thought I\u2019d at least pass all my classes winter quarter.\n\nI don\u2019t want to drop out, I just feel like I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing and am absolutely terrified to lose my scholarship and at this point failing classes like this and my GPA is embarrassing in comparison to majority of other people I know.",

Are you attending all of your lectures, starting assignments early, going to office hours for help, seeking tutoring, studying multiple days in advance of exams? \n\nIf you are doing all of the above and still failing, then a major change may be the way to go. College can definitely be for everyone, but the adjustment period can be more difficult for some. Glad you are seeking academic counseling. They will have good resources and advice.",

Sometimes we need that kind of a wake-up call to take a deep look at what's working and what isn't. I thought I knew how to study, but that reality check pushed me to figure out why I wasn't learning or retaining information the way I thought I should. It took help and humility, but I changed my study habits and retook some classes. It took me a bit longer to graduate, but I did it. I also changed majors (that was stressful) and figured out a better fit for myself. Please don't give up hope! There is a path forward to success (in any way you want to define it) and meeting with advisors etc. is a solid sign of recognizing you need some input &amp; help - that's awesome! \n\nFast forward 30 years when I was hired to teach at Cal Poly, the advisor who helped me was still here but ready to retire. He didn't remember me (there were too many students and too many years in between) but I sure remembered him &amp; thanked him for helping me.  I'm glad I got that chance before he left the campus!",

If something is not working for you, there is no shame in stepping back moving in another direction. My sister entered Harvard as a pre-med student but now, she  not only works for a major network as a producer , but has a couple Emmys on her shelf. Yes, I love to brag about her, but mostly because she had the stones to do something that excited her as opposed to meeting other people's expectations.",

            "comment": "Though I was in the gifted program and was taking several AP courses my senior year in high school, I ended up with a 1.5gpa and didn't graduate. Why? It wasn't because I sucked, it was because that particular environment was bad for the way I learn. I went on to college and though I had a pretty mediocre gpa of 3.5 and ended up dropping out in my third year, I still learned a lot and saw all kinds of value in those two and a quarter uni years. I wish I had stuck it out, though. \n\nSchool isn't for everyone - some people aren't particularly intelligent but still excel at memorization, ace tests, have no trouble with schedules and the rigor of university routine. Other people suck at those things, but are still brighter than the average person. Environment and education style are just as important factors as which classes you're taking, and finding the right mix will do wonders for your ability to thrive. \n\nSo here's my advice: talk to all the counselors and advisors and educators you can and don't feel embarrassed or mad or sad that it's not working out for you the way you hoped it would. Just work to find the right environment for you - if that means switching majors, then do it! College can be tough, as it should be, but it can also be incredibly fun and rewarding, and some of the connections you make and experiences you'll have there can *only* be had in college. \n\nDon't be too hard on yourself, but take the time to really explore all your options and talk to lots of people for their feedback, before you make any significant decisions.",

I was also similar in that I didn't know anything about what I wanted to do. I would suggest just taking GEs in different majors and areas of study until you find something you want to study. I did that until I realized I wanted to study political science, which I am now happily studying.",

I recommend one or two over the summer.",

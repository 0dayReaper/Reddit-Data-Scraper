The Last thing I want is to fail and lose my financial aid. It's about 9k after aid. I was thinking of going to cc for 2 years then transfer for cs. I feel like by then I'd be more independent and ready. Or should I just go? Thank you",

Personally I regret not going as a freshman as I feel like I missed out on a lot of things that you can\u2019t get at cc.",

Now that I am attending CP I realize that I made the right choice. Going to CC would have made me go through admissions again and that is not a guaranteed acceptance. Also CP classes aren\u2019t transfer friendly from what I heard since we take our major based courses as a first year here instead of just mainly GEs like CC. (I could be wrong here)",

    "postText": "i recently got accepted into both cal poly slo and the university of san diego for business administration (concentration in entrepreneurship) as a transfer student coming from cc. slo offered me about 6k in grants and usd offered me 53k (covering most of my tuition). i\u2019m not a huge fan of the beach and i love the idea of a small college town which i know is more slo. i also like the idea of slo because everyone seems so chill and it still has a college vibe (parties, sports, etc.) that i feel like usd lacks. however, i want to go to a school that is going to really put me ahead for my future and offer me amazing internships and job opportunities/networking. please help lol",

I believe cal poly also has 100% (or very nearly 100%) job placement out of college for the business administration program",

I would take a look at other reddit post about cal poly vs \\_\\_ to see what some unique features of cal poly are!\n\nBased on what you said, it sounds like Cal Poly has more of the student culture you are looking for, and there are lots and lots of professional development and network services at cal poly. The college of business strongly supports getting students great internships and employers love hiring cal poly grads because of the Learn By Doing philosophy, that really prepares students for whatever job they are going for.",

CP is a big school in a small town. If you are coming from another big city then a small town is a harder adjustment (Amazon Prime takes several days).  That said college is about getting life experience and mixing it up is great for learning what you want in life.",

I happened to be very involved with accounting clubs which was how I found an internship very last minute my second semester senior year. Been with that cpa firm ever since. That said, I didn't feel like USD provided as much support as the support I perceive at cal poly.  My firm has a CPA that's a cal poly grad and she loved her time there. Based on the learn by doing model, I suspect but don't have proof that she had more experiences with work than me.  While USD is in a huge city, I didn't feel like they were as prepared to help students find employment, particularly non accounting majors",

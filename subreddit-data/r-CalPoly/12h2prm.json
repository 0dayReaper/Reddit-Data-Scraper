There aren\u2019t any doubles in yakitutu or North Mountain, so if it\u2019s super important you could aim for the learning communities that are slotted for the Towers or Red bricks. But it would be better to just assume you\u2019ll get a triple and aim for the learning community that fits you best. Fortunately wherever you land, it\u2019s only for 9 months.",

Leaving it up to gate almost guarantees you\u2019ll end up in a triple. Generally, triples aren\u2019t that bad (I\u2019m in one now.) If you do get in a triple, I\u2019d recommend moving in the earliest you can to secure a lower bunk. The only really bad thing about triples is having a high-up bed.",

    "postText": "Heya, incoming transfer student here. I just got accepted this spring and I\u2019ll be attending in the fall and whatnot. Main thing I wanted to discuss and share with y\u2019all is that I noticed Cal Poly doesn\u2019t have a poker club anymore. \nIf any of y\u2019all are fans of the game and wanna meet people that way I\u2019d suggest maybe starting a league with me where we hold friendly tournaments once a week (no real money! No gambling!) and then maybe have a prize (again not money) to the winner. Other options could include having a league where players can accrue points based on their placement in weekly friendly tournaments, and then have a prize to the winners with the most points at the end of the season.\nThe funding for the prizes would come ideally through initial starting club fees, donations, and from the fees of people paying for snacks. In every other way the club would be free. If the club gets big enough we could even consider donating to non-profit organizations.\nIf it\u2019s only a small amount of players we could make it an unofficial club at first and then grow it from there. Anyways, just throwing the idea out there. Pm me if y\u2019all feel like it.\n:)",

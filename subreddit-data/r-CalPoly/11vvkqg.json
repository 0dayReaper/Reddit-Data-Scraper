The year reported to FAFSA wasn\u2019t normal due to my family selling a property that year resulting in a spike in income. This year and last year my family\u2019s income is much lower, do you think it is reasonable to bring this up? Advice appreciated",

I don't think it is out for the next award year yet; There should be a list of forms that you can go through and see which applies to you.\n\nI'm thinking you can fill out the change in income form but again, not sure.\n\n[link to forms if you just wanna see](https://www.calpoly.edu/financial-aid/forms)",

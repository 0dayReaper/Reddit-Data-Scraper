    "postText": "Hi, i\u2019m a transfer student who got admitted and I am still waiting on decisions from berkeley and ucsd. I was wondering if signing up for housing later (after April 28) would negatively effect my chances of getting housing? just wondering if i should sign up now and take the L on the $500 fee or if i am able to wait, considering housing is due in June.",

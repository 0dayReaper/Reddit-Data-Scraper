    "postText": "Hi! I'm Ricky Carbajal, and I'm starting a comic book club with a few other friends. It's mostly focused on western superhero comics, but we'd love to have folks interested in manga and other books as well. \n\nWe're specifically welcoming queer and neurodivergent comic book readers, since for me it's really important that everyone knows they're welcome as long as they come to the community in good faith. We're hoping to have some kind of book lending/trade system in the future, but for now we're just gauging interest!\n\nHere is a general interest form!\n\nhttps://forms.gle/Ed1LuYvxp9snhn5i6",

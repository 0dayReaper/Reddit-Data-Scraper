    "postText": "I was admitted as a CS major this year and am strongly considering Cal Poly SLO for its small class sizes and learn-by-doing approach, alongside other good OOS choices like Purdue, Uni of Maryland college park for CS. I am from California so CalPoly would be instate for me. I want to know how difficult is to register for the classes at Cal poly SLO? How are career/internship opportunities at SLO? How approachable are the professors during office hours? Do kids usually graduate from SLO within 4 years if coming with a good # of AP credits? How is the overall experience so far? Hope any current/graduate CalPoly CS students can share their own insights and experience. Thanks!",

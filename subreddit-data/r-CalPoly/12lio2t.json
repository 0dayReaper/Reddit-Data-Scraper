Unlike the old website, polyratings.com, we make no use of cookies or do any IP logging whatsoever. We very strongly believe in this. In addition, all of the code for Polyratings is open source [https://github.com/Polyratings/polyratings](https://github.com/Polyratings/polyratings) so all of our claims can be verified.",

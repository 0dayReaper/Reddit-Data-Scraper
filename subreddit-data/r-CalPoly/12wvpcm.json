On the housing application it said we may not get that preferred rlc yet i\u2019ve also heard they will make us stay in that rlc since my roommate and i are in the same rlc. We are planning on staying in a double so what are the chances we will end up in the yosemite/sierra madre dorms and be in a double?",

            "comment": "Chances of you getting a double are extremely slim. Me and my roommate only got a double cause we changed rooms during the mid summer room change but that was a fluke due to a weird housing mishap that they\u2019re changing this summer. There probably are a few doubles in Yosemite/sierra madre but tbh I doubt you\u2019ll get one so hope for a decent rando or find another roommate you like. As for being in the cafes RLC I would say it\u2019s pretty likely. They only really say that in case they fill up but I don\u2019t know anyone who was forced to change RLCs. If they make you change it\u2019ll go to your 2nd choice RLC.\n\nTDLR: you probably won\u2019t get a double and you\u2019ll probably be in Yosemite/sierra madre",

Could anyone who has taken a master's in engineering or mechanical tell me how was their experience in the college.\n\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f",

            "comment": "Hey, I am currently finishing up my Master's in Mechanical Engineering and I did my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering also here at Cal Poly.  As a transfer, you will have to do a thesis, as I am a blended student I was able to do a course option where I take extra courses and have an accumulative exam. I will say that a lot of the program is what you make of it, you'll get out what you put in essentially. The faculty are great, really knowledgeable, and really want to see you grow. Something I have noticed about the master's program is that teachers aren't hounding students with busy work for coursework, and fewer labs than undergrad making it easier in my opinion. It really depends on what you are looking for. Are you looking to specialize heavily in a specific industry? Trying to get hands-on experience as Cal Poly is known for that? Are you trying to focus on research and academia? Realistically you could pursue all of these if you really wanted, you just have to pursue those things. I may be biased as I didn't really look into other programs so I can't really tell you how it compares to other master's in mechanical engineering. Here are some pointers about the program.\n\n1. Project Based Classes that will get you actually making things are ME 443 Turbo Machinery, ME 441 Single Track Vehicle Design, (ME 405 and 507) Mechatronics, and ME 517 advanced vibrations. I also took IME 556 Project Management with Brad Applin which was also a hands-on project if you wanted it to be. All these classes require one to physically design and create a project that usually spends over the course of a quarter. If you are looking to get into hands-on stuff I recommend getting a red tag and yellow tag to use the machine shops for class projects. If you really wanted to there are numerous classes that have more analytical projects where you could incorporate some physical system to really impress your teachers. There are also classes where that don't have a big physical term project but offer some awesome labs that can allow you to get some hands-on experience as well.\n2. If you are looking to get into a specific sector of mechanical engineering, there are master courses that support controls/robotics, fluids/thermal, and machine design/stress analysis. You can take a mix of these courses as you please depending on what you see fit. Also, you can take a few level 500 classes from other departments, for example, I am taking modern controls in the EE department, you can pretty much take any level 500 engineering course but you just have to either get into the class or convince the teacher to let you in, most of the time they will add you after open enrollment. Just email the teachers at the start of enrollment to see what the situation is for that specific class.\n3. Research I will admit I don't know a whole lot since I am doing the course option, but my understanding is there are professors that have projects you can work on for a thesis, or you could get a company to sponsor your thesis or you could do some continuation of a previous student project and raise grant money yourself are the main three types of the thesis I see. Realistically a thesis is largely what you make of it and professors are usually open to listening and helping students so if you see a project you like go after it and professors are usually really nice.",

I did meet with the department head as well as the graduate coordinator. Is their anything else I should know before I start the program?",

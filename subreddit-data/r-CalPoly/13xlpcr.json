    "postText": "i'm registering for fall quarter and am currently waitlisted in all of my classes despite it saying there were open seats when i added the courses. i know this is because a certain amount of seats are saved for incoming freshman's block schedules, but i was wondering, how likely is it that i get into the class from the waitlist (depending on waitlist position ofc) one the open enrollment period starts?\n\ni've tried enrolling in diff classes or diff sections of the same class and i'm pretty much going to be waitlisted anywhere i go, which makes me nervous. this is normal, right? i still have a legitimate shot at getting into the classes i need to get into?",

If you\u2019re in the first five or so there\u2019s a good chance, and if you\u2019re around 25/30 (or however many seats there are in the section) there is a chance they\u2019ll open another section (depending on the course). Like others have said, you can always crash on the first day and ask for a permission number from the prof which, again, depends on the course.",

They\u2019re inundated with ad code requests and don\u2019t have access to the numbers to add you until the end of the first week of classes. They get pretty pissed off with students asking for add codes. Trust me.",

    "postText": "\nI recently got accepted as a transfer into the Landscape Arch program at cal poly. Does anybody have insight into the overall and day-to-day differences between landscape architecture and plant sciences (with horticulture emphasis) at cal poly? I recently heard that LArch requires a ton of studio time and I\u2019m concerned that I won\u2019t be able to work and learn outdoors as much\u2026",

Plant science is the study of plants and biological processes. 2 completely different skill sets. Typical lab times are 3 days a week, 4 hours of class instruction plus work outside of the lab.. trust me, lab was easily a part time 20 hour a week job plus your other courses. This is true for all CAED majors.",

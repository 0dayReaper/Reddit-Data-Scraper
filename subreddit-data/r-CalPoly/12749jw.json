    "postText": "Has anyone had their admissions rescinded with a C-? The provisional admissions state C or better. Last 8wks of school, one exam left and a final to secure a C. But I worry i may get a C- or even a D in AP Calc BC for stem/ME major. What if it is the 6th year of math? I think the requirement is 4, nice to have is 5 or more? Do they consider this?? What should I do, don't want to raise a red flag.",

They accepted you based on your classes and course rigor so passing this class is likely important. I would be studying very hard as being rescinded would, as you know, be a major setback.",

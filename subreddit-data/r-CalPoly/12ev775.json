However, if you have the option to attend the first week, I\u2019d highly recommend it since you\u2019ll be learning the campus and town, and meeting lots of people before the quarter starts.",

If you want every advantage of making friends going to WOW and being on campus that first week makes it super easy to make friends, have a dinner group of friends, go explore, etc. It can be awkward coming in late and feeling like everyone already has their group.",

If you miss the first week you\u2019ll feel behind everyone else when you show up and being on such a large campus can feel overwhelming the first couple of weeks so good to start getting used to it with the rest of your class.",

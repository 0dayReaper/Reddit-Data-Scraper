Waitlisted at CalPoly, which is my dream school. \n4.51 wGPA, 3.96 uwGPA\nwill have 5 APs, 5 CC courses, lots of ECs; athletics, leadership, community service, internship\n\nHow does SDSU compare to CPSLO in mechanical engineering? Still hoping to get into CalPoly, but also strategizing in case I don\u2019t get in whether it would be better to go to CC and apply to CalPoly as a transfer or just go to SDSU. Advice?",

Cal Poly for engineering is on par with some  of the mid tier UCs such as UCSD lmao for engineering I would say Cal Poly is far better. Cal Poly's motto is kinda cliche but it's learning philosphy goes long way into practical skills for industry hence why Cal Poly is so heavily recruited for engineering.",

I have a friends who is studying at SDSU and he has had no issues finding an internship for the summer and I don\u2019t think finding a job afterwards is an issue either. \nPersonally, I took the CC route. You would be a little behind if you take the CC route, but you save a lot of money and I feel like you build a better base going to a semester school for those building block classes (Calculus, Physics, Chemistry). You would also have to take engineering classes such as Materials, Matlab, Circuits, and Statics at the CC. I would argue these engineering classes would have been better at Cal Poly because they would be more focused and you would start to build bonds with the peers that you will see in future classes. I will say that circuits at CC is going to be taught at an Electrical engineering level (much harder and in depth than it needs to be for ME).   The other issue with CC is that you might lose momentum. You get a job and that money sucks you in or you get in a relationship and don\u2019t want to leave them. You have to stay focused and delay gratification. \nGood luck!",

Companies in SD recruit from Cal Poly over SDSU even though we are almost 6 hours away. \n\nHowever SDSU is still a good program and if you apply yourself it really doesn\u2019t matter that much. \n\nI was a transfer to Cal Poly and it was a grind. Community college is much different than highschool and university. If money isn\u2019t an issue for you I\u2019d say go to SDSU and work your tail off. I sometimes regret not spending all 4 years at the same university but I had to save money. Dm me if you have any other questions!",

Please go to Assist.org for classes needed for your major and cal poly website to look at the minimums to have by fall to apply. For ucla to do a 1 year transfer English and math had to be done by the end of summer, so she did those summer after HS graduation. You can then have a good 3 years finishing at cal poly since it\u2019s a tough major. GE classes are miserable to get at cal poly where my freshman daughter goes. Regardless hopefully you get off the waitlist!!!",

    "postText": "incoming freshman at cal poly (class of 2027). i got in for graphic communications, but I really want to take business classes and would even prefer it as my major. IDK if i should switch major to business and then minor in graphic comms OR if I should double major? i think a double major would be cool because it would give me great exposure to both the majors and help me in my desired field of work. I also heard switching majors is really hard, especially for a sought after major like business. should i double major? is it worth it? would grc and business work okay?",

            "comment": "I think you should start by thinking about what kind of jobs you want to do and work back from there. If you want to do project management in the GRC space, then the business major probably wouldn\u2019t give you that significant of a boost over just doing GRC. Double majoring is typically a lot more useful when u are taking a field and supplementing it with technical skills like majoring in Finance + Computer science or bio + engineering. I don\u2019t see GRC + business giving a massive leg up over just picking one and it would probably be more work than it is worth.",

Maybe i could minor? but i heard from my dad\u2019s friend in the field that you can do more with a business ba than a grc one because grc is a lot more niche\u2014 so idk. i would love to learn of both thiugh",

Find some GRC students with UI/UX concentration and talk to them about their experience in the program. \n\nAlso as a general rule for entrepreneurship from the likes of YCombinator and other big hubs. As a founder, you are much better off having some of the technical skills and knowledge for building your initial product. Majoring in entrepreneurship seems like a good way to become an entrepreneur, but it\u2019s somewhat of a fallacy. You\u2019re more likely to be successful starting a company/product if you can build it yourself and run with it while learning the business aspects on the fly and actually experiencing being an entrepreneur. I had a similar thought process and almost went into entrepreneurship, but I ended up doing computer science, and I feel I am in a much better position for starting my own company now as a result of that choice. \n\nBusiness degree is definitely more general if that\u2019s the way you want to go. Can go into a lot of different fields with BA.",

            "comment": "There's  a concentration within graphic communication called Graphic communication management. It's heavy on the business side of the GRC industry, dealing with sales and marketing (at least to my knowledge). You take a lot of business classes in GCM, such as BUS 207 Legal Responsibilites of Business, BUS 303 Introduction to International Business and BUS 310 Introduction to Entrepreneurship. I know a lot of people who like the more business side and less of the print and design side that go into GCM and enjoy it. The GCM concentration head is also very knowledgeable in the field of GRC and Business and is a great person.   \nIt goes more in depth here:   \n[http://www.grc.calpoly.edu/students/grc-management-gcm](http://www.grc.calpoly.edu/students/grc-management-gcm)\n\nBut again, I am a random person on the internet and I don't have personal experience from being a GCM concentration. I suggest following whatever you're heart is telling you. Like someone else said you can only switch after completing a full quarter at Cal poly but that doesn't stop you from talking to an advisor in fall/winter quarter.",

She is in her 4th year, and because of covid and a ton of labs (both are bachelor's of sciences) she will take 4 years and 2 quarters to graduate. \n\nIt has been a ton of coordination between colleges and paperwork to boot.  Be sure you want to see both majors through before committing.  She added the second one in her second year and she loved most of her classes on both sides.  But, as she is approaching the finish line, she wished she did just one as a major and one as a minor and be done in 4 years.  \n\nShe is able to do one senior project for both majors with sign off by heads of both colleges.  She has found CLA much more forgiving when it comes to extra credit, research courses, and double counting classes.  CAFES not so much. I suspect the business school will be similar. \n\nBut, in the end, because of her broad knowledge and dedication. . . She has landed one of the most competitive and lucrative internship programs in the country this summer. Seriously, there are people who want to write articles about her. And, she is already a candidate for direct admit phd programs that are globally recognized. Even when she is tired . . . And frustrated. . . And has two exams the next day. . . She loves it.  I mean really loves it. \n\nWe learned a lot along the way for her to be able to complete a double major in two separate colleges.  Things only a detailed spreadsheet, constant persistence, and a lot of midnight conversations will get you.  Feel free to DM me if you like. \n\nJust be ready for it to be harder and yet more rewarding than you can possibly think of now.  If you feel you are ready . . . Go explore and go get em!!",

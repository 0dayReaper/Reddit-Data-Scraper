    "postText": "I\u2019ve been wondering this for a while because my gpa is only a 4.35 for CS and I have friends who got rejected with 4.4+. That doesn\u2019t make sense since CSUs only go by GPA, and what\u2019s weirder is that I got REJECTED BY POMONA. I know CS is competitive and college admissions are a joke but has that happened before? Could they just rescind my offer after I reject the other colleges I got into(and would still go to, like UCSB or SJSU)",

If it isn\u2019t it should be. Maybe check with Porterville or Sequoias CC advisers to see if there is a preferential transfer at their level.",

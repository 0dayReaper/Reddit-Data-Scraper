Wish Cal Poly had an Undeclared major option for applicants. Will change their major to a narrower eng one by year 3\n\nAstrology but instead of constellations it's eng concentrations could be funny.\n\nElectrical Engineering: Today you will wake up to find you never actually went to bed last night, because your circuit wasn't working. Chuck Bland's pre-lab dad joke will resonate with you unexpectedly and cause you to rethink your relationship with your family. Today is a good day to check Amazon Raspberry Pi prices. Don't ask your lab partner what they got on the prelab assignment questions because they didn't do it and are still blissfully unaware that they are missing something (it's too late for them now).",

Small major and some change to a larger major if they turn out to actually hate chem.",

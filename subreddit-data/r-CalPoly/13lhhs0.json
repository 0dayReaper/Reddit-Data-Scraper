    "postText": "I got into the msba program at cal poly. I'm currently deciding between this and ucr's 2 year MBA program. Any thoughts and insights of cal poly? How are the professors? How much is tuition for the entire program? I heard Cal poly has not much on campus housing and a lot of students tend to live off campus. For those who are currently in or have graduated what is your experience and would you recommend it?\n\nI recently graduated from ucr and if I do go here I'm also planning on working for a 2nd internship at the same company I interned at before since I'm guessing I would need another internship to graduate",

            "comment": "I am a recent graduate of the program and I would say it is a great program overall and fairly affordable. Tuition comes out to about $32,000 for the whole program.\n\nIt starts off fairly intense but then becomes more manageable. An MSBA offers more hand on applicable skills that would give you a decent boost in salary right away. \n\nMyself and most of my cohort had no issues finding good paying jobs. \n\nA plus is that it is a 10 month program and you can hop right back into the industry relatively soon. \n\nMost of the professors are good. \n\nHousing is a little tricky to find so I would start looking soon.",

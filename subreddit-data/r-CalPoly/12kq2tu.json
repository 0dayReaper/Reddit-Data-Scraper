Are you enjoying this program?\n\nFor those who graduated from this program, how are you using the degree now (job wise or in general)?\n\nAlso unrelated to Larch but how common are the experiences in the posts from the shadesofcalpoly instagram account?? Some of them are quite disturbing. Cal Poly\u2019s lack of diversity is a huge con for me.",

She rarely had time for me :/\nBut she's landed some arch type job in the bay and seems to be doing well, and enjoyed the classes.\n\nAs for the IG stuff, you're gonna experience bullshit wherever you go. But yes, Cal Poly is one of the least diverse CA colleges. Fantastic school though.",

I graduated in 2014.\n\nSince I never did anything about this while I was a student, obviously Cal Poly has me in their system as my birth gender. I\u2019m not upset about that because it\u2019s my own fault for not figuring it out sooner, but the problem is that I still get alumni emails, and whoever writes these emails feels the need to address me as \u201cMs. [last name].\u201d\n\nIs there anything I can do about this? Every time I see that \u201cMs.\u201d it makes my skin crawl.",

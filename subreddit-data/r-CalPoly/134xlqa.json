While I was there, yeah most people were just there to get their degree, network, experience, etc. However, there absolutely were people who were very passionate about their major and what they were doing. From talking to my friends that have gone to other schools, it sounds like they all had pretty much the same experience. \n\nTo be completely honest, it feels like the people in the screenshots, and maybe even you, are thinking of an almost fantasized ideal. Unfortunately, that is just not how almost any college is. I'm fairly certain that the vast majority of college students are not actively passionate about their major. They obviously enjoy it to an extent, or have an above average interest in it compared to the general population, but I wouldn't call it passion. \n\nIf you want passion, you will have to seek out the passionate individuals/groups at any school you attend. At any school you go to, you will likely have to go out of your way to surround yourself with people that are truly passionate about what they are doing. They exist, but they aren't the average student. You will be able to find passionate students and will even likely have some in most your classes. However, if you expect to be surrounded by truly passionate students in your average class, I'm afraid you will be sorely disappointed regardless of which school you choose.",

Do students tend to have something they\u2019re passionate about outside of just major/homework or is it a very widespread do homework/party/get a job type of culture? Based on the screenshots, that\u2019s a bit of the vibe I got, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d fit into that type of culture very well",

                            "comment": "I think there might need to be a mental adjustment to your concept of college. Most students are passionate in general, the problem is just time management. If you\u2019re an engineering major, that will fill up your M-F 9am-7pm schedule pretty fast with classes, labs, and homework. That leaves only the weekend to recover from school, which doesn\u2019t leave a whole lot of time to follow your outside passions. Also you\u2019ll probably have more assignments/studying to complete on the weekends since midterm season starts in week 3. You\u2019ll find that the grind of school will detract from your outside passions regardless of where you end up.\n\nIf you\u2019re a business major, you\u2019ll have a lot more time on your hands, but a lot of the people in your major will be passionate about drinking. Most people in college are just trying to survive as well, there\u2019s a big learning curve to living on your own and being self sufficient. \n\nIf you have something in particular you\u2019re very passionate about, maybe delay college for a bit and explore that passion with 100% focus. College will always be there but passions come and go. It\u2019s tough to be 110% passionate all the time in any college setting.\n\nTLDR: the big issue is not passion it\u2019s time management.",

I do think there are plenty of people with passions, including and outside of their major. However, it didn't feel like the average person was necessarily highly passionate about something, at least not openly so. I do also think that, unfortunately with the college life, many people simply do not have a ton of time/resources to dedicate to passions outside of school.\n\nI went for Biology, and I'm probably biased on this, but I feel like that is a major that has an above average amount of passionate people. It's not a major people generally choose for a highly lucrative career, so I assume it attracts an above average amount of generally passionate people. I met a lot of highly passionate people, including passions outside of the subject. I would say it wasn't the average person, but they were there. \n\nDepending on your major, you will likely experience a different subculture. The big thing would be to find a club or group to join that may share your interests, whether it is related to school or extracurricular. Cal Poly has plenty of passionate people. You just gotta go out of your way to seek them out. I would say that, in my experience there, the average student would fit into the \"do your work, have fun, and get a job\" culture. However, I don't think it was particularly better/worse at Cal Poly than anywhere else.",

    "postText": "I've been talking to a lot of my other engineering friends who attend other schools. Although their degree seems to cover the same ebbs and flows of the degrees here, cal poly seems to just require more units overall to graduate. My degree has more supports, more GEs, and often more major courses. I know the conversion is a little weird since they are all on semester, but even so, the cal poly degree seems to take more classes to receive. \n\nHas anyone else noticed/felt this way? Honestly just curious.",

            "comment": "Yes and the difference is normally larger than what is stated. Most majors will be 180-190units. Often about 40 of those units are free elective and can be accounted for by APs or courses of choosing (the business program is a 3 year degree for those with a lot of ap or cc credit). Many of the engineering programs are 192-203. Some have 0 or very few free elective credits, so there are also a much larger amount of courses that have to be taken in the core curriculum. My engineering friends are normally taking 16 units, and a lot of my business friends normally take 12 units per quarter.",

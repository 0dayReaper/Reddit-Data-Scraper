    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019m an intl student currently deciding between Cal Poly SLO CS and UMD CS right now. Costs are almost equal for both. Can you please help me with some questions on the CS program?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Is it difficult to graduate in 4 years?\n2. Is it difficult to register for classes of your choice?\n3. How are the CS extracurriculars and clubs?\n4. How helpful are the career fairs for finding an internship or a job?\n5. How is the name recognition of Cal Poly SLO nationally?\n6. I noticed Apple and Amazon were listed as Platinum Career Partners. What does this mean?\n7. Negatives of Cal Poly?\n8. How is Cal Poly for someone looking to concentrate in ML/AI?",

It is well known among tech companies.\n8. Cal Poly has a AI concentration\n\nMore info: https://mckoder.medium.com/why-choose-cal-poly-for-computer-science-e620b9ce588d",

I was able to take a 500 level natural language processing class my senior year, which went pretty in depth into cutting edge language tools (think chatgpt) through individual research projects. I imagine taking the compilers class is hugely beneficial for CS theory, and everyone has to take Programming Languages, which goes into the construction/design of programming languages. If you want to get super theoretical beyond that, you're looking at a master's degree.\n\nIf you were hell bent on avoiding theory you could do it, but I feel like I'm pretty well set up to take on anything that isn't designing ML architectures. That's more grad degree territory.",

Looks like there's a [full minor in it](https://catalog.calpoly.edu/collegesandprograms/collegeofsciencemathematics/biologicalsciences/crossdisciplinarystudiesminorbioinformatics/), but wouldn't be able to speak to its quality. Most of the minors/specialization tracks were introduced the year after I graduated. \n\nThere's at least one active HCI course, but again wouldn't be able to speak to its quality. ([Full catalog](https://catalog.calpoly.edu/coursesaz/csc/))\n\nCS professors across the board were excellent, didn't think there were any that were bad, and the majority of them were outstanding.",

For a major like Mechanical Engineering, it could mean design of a part (as opposed to manufacturing the part). For CS, such a distinction does not exist.\n\nWhen top companies such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft interview you for jobs, they look for (1) problem solving skills and (2) ability to implement your solution in code. Cal Poly prepares you for both.",

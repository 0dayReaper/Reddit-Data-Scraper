I felt like I was making a huge mistake turning down UCLA, but years later I\u2019m very happy with the decision. I sat in on EE classes at both UCLA and Cal Poly before deciding too.\n\nI noticed at UCLA it was a cold, depressing environment that was too competitive for my own taste. Nobody spoke to anyone else before the class, or after. I didn\u2019t enjoy the location either, being in a densely populated area.\n\nCal Poly ended up being far more competitive than I had imagined, but everyone was collaborative. I still keep in touch with all my peers and a few were in my wedding. You\u2019ll probably develop closer relationships at CP if that means anything to you.\n\nI could go to the beach, turn on music and go for a run on a Sunday to unwind and forget the stress for awhile without it being a mad house like a SoCal beach and without having to fight traffic or public transport to get there in the first place.\n\nCal Poly and SLO made those years the best of my life and I\u2019m sure it will for you too.\n\nAny other questions feel free to DM.",

It might be easier to apply for local jobs in a big city, too, since they know you are already local and have housing and may be able to work in-person part-time after your summer internship during the school year.\n\nThat said, Cal Poly is great for its hands-on work where it\u2019s very easy and encouraged to actually design and manufacture things. You gain so much confidence doing that. Also, the smaller class sizes and the green landscape surrounding campus are healing compared to a big city university\u2019s larger class sizes and hectic city surroundings.\n\nCal Poly also has great connections to engineering companies like Northrop and SpaceX that you may not find elsewhere. Although I imagine bigger UCs like UCSD probably have similar.",

This is probably because we aren\u2019t a huge research institution and our sports are mediocre a lot of the time. When it comes to employers (especially western US), we often rise to the top. The curriculum at cal poly is just better tailored to creating good engineers day 1. We may not learn as much theory, but most engineers aren\u2019t going to need to get nitty gritty with the exact science of semi conductors. And if they do, poly provides plenty background information to allow a grad to piece it together themselves. If one wants to pursue a highly theoretical grad degree (likely a phd), then I\u2019d lean more toward UCs. Otherwise cal poly all the way (when it comes to academics).",

I would also like to mention that definitely put campus life as a VERY HIGH priority in terms of deciding a college. These are some of the best years of your life, so don't choose a college just because it has a slightly better engineering program. All the schools you listed have very solid engineering programs (Irvine is a little iffy, I have heard many complaints), so I would go with whichever one you visit and makes you feel like you belong.\n\nCal Poly is in a beautiful area and I have met some fantastic people here. I don't regret my decision, you get the nice California beach weather, the food is amazing, and the experiences are memorable and these years have been so much damn fun. But go with your gut in terms of choosing. UCSB is also a beautiful school, I didn't go because it didn't feel right. Never been to UCSD personally.",

It\u2019s best you find the uni you feel most comfortable and connected with. Cal Poly was the choice for me because of its more intimate class size, collaborative student culture, idyllic location and climate, and solid engineering reputation and overall uni quality. It was exactly the kind of school that I needed at that phase of my life. I probably would have flunked out of engineering in UC Berkeley even if I had been accepted (I was rejected).     \n  \nEngineering is not easy, something like 67% of the engineering entering class eventually drop out of engineering before graduation (for any university). Therefore, choose a uni that plays to your strengths and personality.  \n  \nDon\u2019t get overly concerned with comments about travelling logistics to your uni of choice, post uni grad school admissions (just try your best to get decent grades regardless of where you choose to attend), post uni job opportunities. All of your school choices will position you nicely upon completing your engineering degree with solid grades.\n  \nBtw, I was also a semiconductor design engineer after Poly.",

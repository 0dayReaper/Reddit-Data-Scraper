It's not that complicated. Sure, coopsare not psychologist, and they certainly need some adjustments and help with deescalattion but at the end of it all we need police, for things like this, and MANY other reason. So promoting the idea of \"ACAB\" and what stands for it short sighted at the least and certinly ignorant... especially when in the same statment you are asking for their help. That's some freshman level logic. No go back to school kid and comeback when you're wearing big boy pants and live in the working world.",

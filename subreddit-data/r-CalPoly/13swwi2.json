    "postText": "I'm a CS major interested in taking CSC 365: Introduction to Database Systems and DATA 301: Introduction to Data Science. I'm doing general concentration but noticed that under the AI concentration, students must do only one of them (365 or 301). Does that mean CSC 365 and DATA 301 are basically the same or similar? And does that mean it's recommended to just take one instead of both?",

            "comment": "They are not similar, lmao if you want to do data science in the future you should both. Data 301 is introduction to data science and introduces you to the basic python packages used in data science such as pandas and numpy. CSC 365 teaches you SQL which is really important in a lot of data science roles in manipulating and cleaning large datasets before you can find meaningful statistcaal analysis in the data sets.  I would definitely do both",

            "comment": "They are not at all similar.\n\nDATA 301 teaches you the basics of machine learning. If you look at [dekhtyar syllabus](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/301-Spring2022/index.html) he teaches Linear regression, K-nearest neighbors, classification and clustering, hyperparameter tuning, and so on. All this is basic ML. If you are interested in ML or want to take AI concentration, this course teaches the basics. Even if you have taken CSC 365 you should still take this because this is foundational for AI, and 365 has none of these topics.\n\nNow take a look at [365 syllabus](https://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/365-Fall2022/index.html). It is all about relational algebra, joining tables, grouping and so on. This is clearly a different subject entirely and it has nothing really to do with AI. Almost all companies who have data (such as customers and orders) store it in relational databases, even if they have nothing to with AI.\n\nBoth these courses are useful. It doesn't make sense to say that if you have taken one the other is not needed. For newer CS majors, CSC 365 is mandatory [see here](https://flowcharts.calpoly.edu/downloads/mymap/22-26.52CSCBSU.pdf) and it should be.",

            "comment": "I personally don't see why CSC 365 is under AI concentration since DATA 301 fits much better and MYSQL/database concepts don't really fit into AI, but if you're interested in a software dev career and not that interested in data science  then csc 365 will probably be more helpful\n\nEdit: CSC 365 does cover some dataset manipulation, so I guess that's why it's an option, but DATA 301 is still the better choice imo",

                    "comment": "csc 365 doesn't fall into \"AI\" but you're most certainty gonna use SQL if you're doing data science, data analyst, or machine learning engineer. It's a really useful skill to have in the data science industry even though it isn't \"AI\". For cs students, I really think csc 365 is the better option because data 301 is in python and the basic is learning the basic libraries which cs students can self learn easier than the course content covered in 365",

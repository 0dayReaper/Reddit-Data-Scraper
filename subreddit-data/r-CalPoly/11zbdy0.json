As someone who is mixed, I think the main problem is that there are a great number of people who expect Cal Poly to be Berkley or UCLA and it simply is not. If you are looking for some grand cultural experience (in the way of learning more about your culture, ancestors, community, and such), Cal Poly is just likely not going to be a good fit. Or people expect to have big town amenities and enclaves, in a small town hours from both LA and SF. Or people end up not liking the smaller network of cultural clubs that exist. And that\u2019s typically the main problem I think many of these folks don\u2019t want to address. They picked the wrong school. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: Cal Poly, like any school, has its issues or does have its share (again like any other school) or stupid and/or hateful people. But people are not going out of their way to somehow make you feel like you don\u2019t belong. And if you want to engage with your identity and culture side, there are plenty of opportunities and people will be supportive of that. But you simply won\u2019t have as many opportunities or resources as you might elsewhere. Anyway, if your primary focus is your field of study and you don\u2019t mind being around a few more rich white kids than perhaps you were at your high school, you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nAlso, Cal Poly has greatly changed in the past decade. Yes, it\u2019s still not the paragon of diversity, but there is quite a bit that has happened, even if some don\u2019t feel like it. But the problem is that any efforts or memory of the past reset every four years or so. I know progress is slow, but there are genuine improvements.\n\nAnyway, hope that helps.",

I was a first gen mexican American and made plenty of friends, both non POC and POC, and was never disrespected for being POC by anyone. Sure, there are some people who take more than a quarter or two to find a group of friends, but that is true for non POCs and POCs alike. People are people and are more alike in terms of social struggles than you think. What you read and hear online is greatly exaggerated, and mainly stems from hearsay as opposed to people with first hand experience. While shadesof IG is first hand experiences, other schools have shadesof accounts and equally sound as \u201cterrifying\u201d, but that\u2019s what happens when you have a concentration of negative stories.  It\u2019s not like there\u2019s an account where you can read only positive stories of CP, so don\u2019t go off of that IG while you make your decision. \n\nI also maintain a strong belief that discouraging yourself or other POCs from attending is contributing to the diversity issue; it\u2019ll remain white if all POCs decide not to attend over greatly exaggerated lies of racism.  Yes there are incidents but it\u2019s latent racism; no one is shouting death threats at you or shouting at you while you\u2019re walking to school like they did the Little Rock Nine. \n\nIt is a great school with a great engineering program and I am glad to have attended. I wish you well in whatever you decide but I\u2019m just hoping to add some perspective while you make your decision.",

We have huge Asian cultural clubs with the biggest being the Chinese Students Association. I've met a lot of friends from there and it's a great way to socialize (and get into parties if that's your thing \ud83d\ude05). It's pretty much like one big frat because they run the big / little program which comes from frats. Also when I was rushing for the frat I'm in, not once did I feel left out or excluded for being Asian. Of course the frat is majority white because it's a social one, but honestly everyone is super accepting and chill. Even the white people I've met on my floor have been really respectful and we're good friends. For academic opportunities, race definitely doesn't play a role. I've felt equal to all my peers in my classes since the first day I've been here I have freshman CS friends with internships already and other friends who have got interviewed at FAANG companies. This school is an engineering school and tons of people get internships even from their first year. If you want a high paying job right out of college, come here. Overall, SLO is just a great school and a beautiful place to live. I mean there is a lack of good Asian food here, with Japanese and Thai being the only options in downtown (there's a Chinese place but it's terrible). But the beautiful sunsets everyday, the fresh air, the clear sky with stars every night, and the beach so close to campus has made the first two quarters of my freshman year amazing. I absolutely love this place and chose it over Duke and Northeastern and I'm damn happy I did. I'll be graduating with zero debt because of how affordable this place is compared to private schools and UCs.",

It's a MASSIVE culture shock going from everyone being a low income Hispanic to everyone being from upper middle class white families lol\n\nTo be completely honest, I did not enjoy my time in SLO. People weren't outright racist or anything (oh wait, yea some were lol -- the Navajo frat party, black face incident, and Milo Y visiting all occured when I was a student), but you won't encounter anything like that in your day to day and honestly probably never have to deal with it at all.\n\nWhat you DO feel is exclusion -- either feeling left out/like you don't fit in or literally being left out. This was rampant throughout the culture there, in my experience.\n\nThere are lots of cliques and comfort in people who come from similar backgrounds. Majority of people in SLO are from more well off families near the Bay and that's just so different from where I was from. They tend to stick together and feel fake nice, or overly nice bc you're not white l m a o\n\nI dont think I'm alone, either. Naturally, I made a lot of friends who are POC and they all echo'd the same sentiment. A lot of us became friends, hung out, and shared culture.\n\nThere is also not a lot of culture in the county of San Luis Obispo. It's all white college kids and old retired white people. Nothing, no where, for many miles besides nature. Nature is neat but it didn't keep me entertained or engaged for 4 years tbh\n\nThat said, it's a good school. Lots of opportunitiy and great career placement in engineering. The network you make here is VERY valuable (EVERYONE I know works in big tech,big account, etc.) \n\nNo one is outright mean. No one (I hope) intentionally enforces this feeling of exclusion. But it's felt. Do what you will with this information.",

Not to mention that the small town environment seems to magnify the culture shock. There will always be micro aggressions (and it seems like 2-3 racist incidents during your time there\u2014kind of like a crude \u201crite of passage\u201d as a Cal Poly student of color), but ultimately building and strengthening your community on campus are huge. I couldn\u2019t have made it through my 4 years at Poly without kind professors and staff who \u201cgot it\u201d and the friends I made who understood what it was like to be away from home/culture. If you go into it understanding all this, and taking advantage of everything that campus and SLO have to offer, hopefully you can have an experience with a lot more highs than lows.",

I literally worked on a campus wide survey called CPX. The numbers show that Cal Poly has lots of work to do to RETAIN students of color, why? Bc Cal Poly has an underlying white supremacist values that protects racist frats/sororities/organizations and protect property /companies that donate, over students well being. \n\n\nTHAT being said, I still LOVED THE FUCK outta SLO and made hella Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) Friends. I was involved with the Cross Cultural Centers setting up programs for students, was an orientation leader for historically minoritized groups, and was a part of MANY cultural groups. \n\n\nEveryone\u2019s experiences is different, at the CORE of it all, seeking and nurturing community is what will support you the most in college.

Most of my network is BIPOC, and as a photographer who regularly photographs events on the central coast and specifically in SLO, I can tell you that there ARE racist pieces of garbage here...\n\n...but they're few and far between. The large majority of white people here on the central coast are welcoming in general, and even the ones who aren't are mostly just standoffish. Latino makes up the largest percentage of POC (30% of the total population!), followed by Asian (around 13%, and then a very distant black population (around 1%). \n\nThere has been a significant increase in efforts by the city to be more inclusive for a good long while now, to promote more inclusively and to tackle racism head-on whenever it pops up, which is pretty rarely. \n\nYou can see from my photography that while there are a ton of white folks, there is also a thriving community of POC: https://clients.namu.love\n\nEither way, I think you'd be welcome and I hope you decide to come through!",

Being Asian and also from a more \u201chood\u201d and lax environment (the IE/LA) there are a LOT of culture shocks but honestly most are pleasantly surprising. Never really had any experiences of racism from older folks maybe just one major and a few passive aggressive comments but it\u2019s not like the whole community. \n\nMost of the racism I\u2019ve faced are from Polly dolly\u2019s in the bar bathrooms who don\u2019t think I understand English but, obviously, I do. So overall the community in SLO is amazing, kind, and welcoming. Personally the most issues I\u2019ve had are with younger teenagers who are detached from the outside and are stuck in the bubble of slo, and I think those who are prejudiced here have just never truly experienced what life is like elsewhere (in an enjoyable way?). And the only thing that sucks here is that there\u2019s a lack of international cultures and people, food, stores, etc\u2026 (I\u2019m Asian so I\u2019m speaking for myself when I say there\u2019s not many authentic options for me and not that big of a community) there can definitely be improvements, but it\u2019s not bad bad (unless you go to certain counties) \n\nIf you\u2019re kind and friendly to everyone they will be nice back, there will be some bad seeds but you will meet some of the most interesting and unique personalities that drown out the bad. It\u2019s a lifestyle I guess, and although it\u2019s not one of my favorites you will see many good things that will enrich your understanding of people and different \u201cCali cultures\u201d. Also the growing Latino population here is the closest thing to home for me and have welcomed me into the community with open arms before the \u201clocals\u201d of this town has so there\u2019s that too. \n\n* Note: I\u2019m very sorry for this long rant I usually don\u2019t comment but I have felt what you were feeling and resonated with this and wanted to give my elaborate two cents :) I hope you have a good experience here",

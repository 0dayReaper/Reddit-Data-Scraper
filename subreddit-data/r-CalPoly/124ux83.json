You clearly haven\u2019t gotten to college if you\u2019re already saying med school track. And no I beg to differ everywhere for premed is hard lmao. Are there harder schools for premed that deflate grades ? \n\nSure you got schools like Berkeley and Princeton. But that\u2019s not to say premed is easy at other schools and hard at other schools. Also the difference in difficulty  is overrated a lot and also if you can do well at one school I don\u2019t see how you can\u2019t do well another.  The vast majority of schools are similar in difficulty and I don\u2019t really understand people that choose schools based on reputation of how \u201chard\u201d a school is because most schools there is little difference. I see premeds going to one school because of a reputation of grade inflation but a lot of times they still need to work very hard to get a high gpa.  That\u2019s the case for practically all schools where you will have to work very hard to do well in gen chem,ochem, and biochem\n\nI can assure you cal poly neither deflates nor inflates so if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about don\u2019t worry. Choose your schools based on other factors rather than how hard the school is",

I would say the only classes I truly struggled with were the OChem series, but that subject is supposed to be hard no matter where you take it. I did it over COVID, and even when I failed, I came swinging back with high grades afterward.\n\nAs someone else said, research is actually pretty easy to get into (just get over the intimidation factor and send an email to professors you like!) and most professors are quite approachable for office hours. There are also some pre-med-specific clubs such as AMSA, and a pre-med advising center that should be helpful for you as well.\n\nI'm no longer on the pre-med track (switched off two years ago, and I'm now attending grad school next fall!), but feel free to message me if you have specific questions!",

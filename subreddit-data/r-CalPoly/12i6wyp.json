    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m currently trying to decide on either Cal Poly Slo or UC Santa Cruz to attend next fall as an incoming freshman. Ill be going in as a political science major but I plan to switch to child development. I\u2019m extremely torn between the two so I thought I\u2019d ask for advice on here. \n\n(I\u2019m a first generation Hispanic college student and am a little hesitant about cal poly due to lack of diversity I\u2019ve heard about, if there\u2019s any other input on that end I\u2019d love to hear as-well.)",

Yes the lack of diversity is unfortunate but there are so many culture clubs, student associations, centers, resources, etc. and both colleges and the university as a whole recognize and work towards DEI initiatives. I do not know much about the child development tract specifically, but Cal Poly's strong suit is giving students hands on experience with research and career fields that can be really hard to find at UCs",

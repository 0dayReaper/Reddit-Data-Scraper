    "postText": "These past few weeks I\u2019ve been feeling extremely depressed. I\u2019ve been losing motivation to do anything and motivation to exist. I\u2019ve been sleeping a lot more and skipping my classes. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I feel like this. I have great friends, a great partner, great classes, and I\u2019m apart of some great clubs. \n\nI really don\u2019t know how to talk to my friends/partner about how I feel and I feel like I would be a burden especially since I\u2019m sure they\u2019re all busy and stressed as well. \n\nWhat are the counseling services like here on campus? I find it difficult to take that step to call and make an appointment. I think I just feel intimidated by counseling when I\u2019ve had bad experiences in the past.",

There are lots of people with similar feelings (students, non-students). \n\nIt's great that you're  acknowledging your feelings and issues. Please try to continue going to classes, club meetings, etc. Maybe do something  different like take a hike or go to the beach just to clear your head. Hope you find resources and support! Take care of yourself.",

I'm willing to bet you wouldn't. If these are good friends they won't want you to struggle by yourself just because you think you might be a burden for them.",

I don\u2019t know what the counseling services are like at CalPoly (yet). But I know that you calling them is a step in the right direction. You may not be able to pinpoint exactly how/why you feel down or depressed. It is an illness just like any physical illness, etc. When we\u2019re feeling physically ill, sometimes we need to get help. So we call the doctor, go to urgent care, etc. This is the same thing.  And I agree with the previous post - if someone else was feeling like you do, I\u2019m sure you would help them\u2026 Maybe they\u2019re feeling the same way you do and you can help each other.",

If you have insurance, I\u2019ve enjoyed working with Bridges Therapy, an organization here on the Central Coast. I have MediCal and it\u2019s totally free for me.\n\nYour feelings are totally valid. Yes, it is a pretty depressing time. We all collectively went through a once in a century traumatic even that killed millions of people, there are wars going on, inflation is rampant, the housing crisis is getting worse by the day all while our generation is faced with legitimate existential threats from climate change and pollution. A lot of people aren\u2019t okay right now, especially people your age. College is typically when mental health disorders manifest. \n\nBut the great news is theeapy and or medication are extremely effective. Just remember you you won\u2019t always feel this way and you can work to feel better everyday with a therapist and other support networks. Chin up kid you got this. We all do.",

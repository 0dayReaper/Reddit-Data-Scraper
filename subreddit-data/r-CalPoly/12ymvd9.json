    "postText": "ok so i just committed to slo yesterday and im going to be a part of cal poly scholars. in order to be part of it, you have to accept the award they give you in the financial aid checklist before may 1.\n\nmy question is, can i accept those awards and click the \u201csubmit\u201d button without accepting the loan options ? like can i go back eventually and accept one of the loan options once i decide how much i will be taking out ? im not sure if this makes sense",

            "comment": "If you decide you need loans later, you have to contact the financial aid office so they can re-open the award in the portal. If you do so partway into the quarter they may need to pro-rate how much you qualify for in federal student loans\n\nIf you have any Direct Subsidized loans in your financial aid package, keep in mind that the interest on that loan type is *subsidized* (i.e. paid on your behalf) when you are enrolled above the half-time threshold and during your grace period. You'd just be out the ~1% loan fee, and if you repay the loan within 120 days of the disbursement date it is cancelled like you never took it out in the first place. All of this info is outlined on studentaid.gov, so if you wanted to accept just the Subsidized loan portion for now that would be relatively low risk",

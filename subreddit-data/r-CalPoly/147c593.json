Homework is only listening to every Beatles album and writing your thoughts on each song (barely an hour per week). The midterm was take-home open note and the final was chill too. There's a 5 page paper but you can write it on literally anything having to do with the Beatles and he grades more on whether you care and are actually interested in what you're writing. Highly recommend the class if you can take it. I think I ended up with like a 96 or something like that.",

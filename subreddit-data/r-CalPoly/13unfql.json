            "comment": "It's hard to be an effective bus system when you have no money, and a drastic shortage of drivers. \n\nOverall ridership in 2022 was less than half that of 2019's numbers. 2023 is currently on pace to be less than 1/3 of that 2019 number. It's a vicious cycle, where less ridership means less funding, which leads to even less ridership, which leads to less funding. The city won't put more money into it until there's higher ridership, and potential riders won't ride the bus more unless there's more money for more availability and consistency of service. It's a crossroads that neither party is willing to cross.\n\nI feel your pain, and I really wish we could have a better bus system, but there's nothing pointing in the direction of improvements being made in the near future. COVID-19 really screwed it up.\n\nSource: I literally work for SLO Transit",

I took the bus pre-pandemic and really the only major change is that they dont have extra 3 &amp; 4 busses during peak hours (8am,12pm,5pm) and they dont run quite as late (used to go until midnight).\n\nOne of the biggest problems during the pandemic was staffing bus drivers.

    "postText": "Hello, I am a current first-year CAFES student who was going to live in PCV next year. The issue is that I have to take the fall quarter off. I emailed housing and asked if I could keep my reservation. They said that I could not and had to reapply in October. I understand that I will probably get housing if I apply in October, however, I'd rather live off-campus.\n\nWhere are the best places to look for off-campus housing? How difficult is it to get a sublease from someone who will graduate fall quarter? \n\nAlso, I need to take care of everything before June 25th.",

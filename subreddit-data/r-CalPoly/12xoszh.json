Now that there\u2019s more foot traffic and vehicles driving on it, it can be a dangerous road. All you have to do is pay attention to how fast people drive to get on the on ramp to the 101 on grand (near frederick\u2019s) to see how dangerous this road can be. People drive fast on these turns because they are trying to beat all the traffic and even at times, people. It needs to be re-evaluated",

I\u2019m not necessarily saying this is the case, but it\u2019s not uncommon enough to rule it out. Regardless, it\u2019s a tragedy and the city should seriously consider adding more stop signs/ traffic lights, lowering the speed limit, and adding more street lights to grand Avenue and the streets that branch off of it.\nEdit: typo",

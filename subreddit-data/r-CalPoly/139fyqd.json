    "postText": "Hey Reddit,\n\nAs my AP Calc AB test approaches this monday, I've realized that my senioritis has led me to not really understanding calc, and probably not passing the test to get credit to skip calc 1 at slo.\n\nAm I screwed? And if so, by how much? I'm coming in as a freshman in aerospace engineering... Am I going to be relativly behind w/ my peers and in my classwork after retaking calc 1 freshman fall semester? \n\nthanks!",

Being behind an AP test probably isn\u2019t ideal but will hardly have any effect on your class schedule, especially after a few quarters. Don\u2019t worry too much about being behind your peers, there are certainly plenty of them without the AP credit for any number of reasons, and you\u2019ll have plenty of class overlap with them regardless.",

You'll be fine starting in Calc 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThat being said, if you want to get ahead you could take it over the summer, but its possible you would have to retake calc 1 anyway if you didnt get your units transfered over early enough",

            "comment": "You don't need calculus 1 for freshman engineering courses. Since you're mentioning calculus 1, I'm assuming you're starting with basic engineering classes or rather prerequisites for later engineering classes. I didn't go to this school so my experience might be different, but the most advanced math I needed to know (freshman year) was basic 3x3 matrices and 3D vector notation (I learned this in pre-calc). Other than that, integrals and derivations were useful to understand physics 1 better, but it's not terrible without it. \n\nAssuming you pass calc 1, but you absolutely feel certain you don't understand it, YOU SHOULD RETAKE IT IN SOME WAY OR FORM because it'll be crucial for higher level math. Calc 1 will be the foundation for further courses. You don't need to understand it perfectly, but you should be confident in your knowledge.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you are behind your peers. You move at your own pace. Retaking 1 class won't ruin your academic career and won't put you behind your peers.",

I also did not do too well on the pre assessment test to see if I could get placed into calc 1 because I forgot everything that I learned. This however did not set me back as much as I thought as an SE major. The only downside that I really see so far is me having to take math classes longer and I\u2019m dreading it lol. Also you could just do summer classes if you really want to catch up but I\u2019m my case it\u2019s ok as long as I don\u2019t fail one of those math classes. A lot more stem majors are in precal at the start than I thought.",

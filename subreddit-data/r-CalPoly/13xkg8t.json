            "comment": "Yeahhhh, my guy, this is too much, obviously. You know that. Gonna ask some hard questions here...not trying to be mean, I hope they'll help you have a better time in the program. So...are you just posting to ask which you should drop? Are you trying to get out in a certain time frame because of financial constraints? or Visa limitations? I just mean that there are real world reasons why someone would do this, but barring anything like that, obv this is not a recipe for success and even Dr. Widmann would tell you that. You don't only have to thing of yourself but also others who are trying to get into these same classes for degree completion. If you take up a seat and drop later than 7 days, no body can add that class that they need too. Just a thought for your fellow engineers.\n\nNext...neuroscience reasons. Some of my friends up above have already mentioned this, but you physically cannot make neural connections fast enough to retain and truly comprehend this bandwidth of information. Since the program is foundational, and bottom up, you need the earlier classes to succeed in upper division courses. Keep practicing your FBDs and MADs, and stress stain curves. You'll need them.\n\nPhysical health and metal health also need to be built into your schedule, like a lab. Add three hours a week for therapy, support group, or hanging out doing stress relieving stuff, diet planning, hiking or exercise, spiritual practice, family time, learning something for the joy or it, swinging on the swings at the beach, being in nature, volunteering or service projects, mentoring, or doing something other than studying or gaming or Netflix. It literally helps your brain plasticity and will help you learn everything else better. When we help others, we gain a brain chemistry benefit of oxytocin and dopamine, as well as when we accept help FROM OTHERS, so practice that too.\n\n16 is plenty, research shows that getting a job for 10 hours a week actually helps students learn. This is another neuroscience thing too...if you are constantly stressed trying to keep up with study group meetings outside of class, class assignments, pre-lab and lab reports, experiment documentation, homework, mid-terms, etc...3 things will happen: your sleep will probably be bad causing a cascade or negative physical and mental issues, you'll start doubting your ability to learn, be smart, have confidence in your answers, and MOST IMPORTANTLY you will have an excess or adrenaline and cortisol in your bloodstream which literally causes the CONSTRICTION or the blood vessels in your brain, causing lack of blood flow to your brain, most importantly to your PREFRONTAL CORTEX, which is usually not fully formed until almost age 30. Why do you need your PFC, you ask?  A LOT or reasons including:  \nFocusing one's attention, Predicting the consequences of one's actions; anticipating events in the environment. Impulse control; managing emotional reactions. Planning for the future.\n\n&gt;  \nPrefrontal cortex: The most widely studied changes in young adulthood are in the prefrontal cortex, the area behind the forehead associated with planning, problem-solving, and related tasks. At least two things affect the efficiency in its functioning:  \nmyelination: the nerve fibers are more extensively covered with myelin, a substance that insulates them so that signals can be transmitted more efficiently, and  \nsynaptic pruning: the \"briar patch\" of connections resulting from nerve growth are pruned back, allowing the remaining ones to transmit signals more efficiently.  \nConnections among regions: At the same time, the prefrontal cortex communicates more fully and effectively with other parts of the brain, including those that are particularly associated with emotion and impulses, so that all areas of the brain can be better involved in planning and problem-solving.  \n\"Executive suite\": The cluster of functions that center in the prefrontal cortex is sometimes called the \"executive suite,\" including calibration of risk and reward, problem-solving, prioritizing, thinking ahead, self-evaluation, long-term planning, and regulation of emotion. \u00a9 A. Rae Simpson 2018 rsimpson@mit.edu\n\nSorry this is so long, but I hope that it will help everyone with planning and self-care and relationships during your time here. We are all rooting for you! Please don't think you need to do this to seem smart or successful or busy enough. ALSO...replace something with an IME class where you get to make shit. IT'S FUN AS HELL! Take care.",

Then again, I do not know your personal situation, am not you and as such, only YOU are able to decide for yourself. You can also pray to God, I find it helps temporarily, but it's something that you need to build up.",

(note: this plan doesn't need to adhere to the flowchart, it just needs to meet the requirements of your degree catalog).",

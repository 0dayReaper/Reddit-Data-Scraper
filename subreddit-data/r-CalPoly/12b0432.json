I'm flexible with the dates and furnishing: I'm willing to sublease just over either the summer or fall, and I'm able to leave or take my bed and desk and other furnishings. The house is in a great location: 20 mins walk/ 5 min bike/ 5 min drive from campus. DM or comment if you're interested or have questions!",

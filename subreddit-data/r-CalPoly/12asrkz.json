    "postText": "Hello, can somebody suggest who is an easy professor for STAT 312. I have heard that Doi is an amazing professor but is hard and Frank's class is an easy A. Can somebody please suggest who should I get into. I am planning to take CSC 357, CPE 315, Calc 4 and a stat class so I want the STAT class to be with an easy professor.",

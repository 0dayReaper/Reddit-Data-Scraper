For the most part people in PCV don't talk to their neighboring flats, so you might not know what their RLC is unless you knocked on their door at a good time and asked",

The RLC is just the people in it, so if you chose Pride RLC when room selection time came it would try to prioritize putting you in rooms where other people had that RLC. The geographical distribution of RLCs within the building is based mostly on where the larger groups that get to choose rooms first select (ie. if 3 Pride RLC folks are friends from the year before and squad up to be roommates, they'll get to chose a room before loners and then that room is likely going to fill with Pride RLC solos, so they effectively claimed that flat for Pride RLC). This all gets less clean if the RLC proportions are all whack cuz Housing will try to fill every room and if there is one room left in the building and a person chose Culture but the other people in that flat are Pride, they could still get put in there. It wouldn't be a Pride/Culture flat tho, there would just be someone in the Pride RLC against their preference",

If your RLC is actually fixed before then, then you'd be barred probably. When you look at people who already selected a room you're looking at, it used to show their RLC so it probably still does that. If you want 100% answers contact Housing/RAs who can ask Housing because I haven't seen Housing employees on here and a lot of the nitty gritty of room selection changes as the software gets updated and the people who arbitrate decisions change",

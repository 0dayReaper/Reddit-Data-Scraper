Other people deserve a chance at the excellent education Cal Poly provides. If they can admit more people--which they can--they should.\n\nYou do not have a special right to keep Cal Poly the same just because you were admitted.

Cal Poly has been explicitly told by CSU administration and lawmakers that it must admit more students. Nobody at Cal Poly gains financially from admitting more students. This is just a lazy way of ignoring the fact that the individuals choosing to admit more students have different moral values than you do (less self-centered ones, in my view).\n\nBecause Cal Poly is one of the best value-propositions in the CSU, this is the moral position to take.\n\nI do not own Cal Poly; neither do you. If the quality must suffer slight so that more people can attend an excellent college at a reasonable price, that is a just tradeoff.\n\nIt is of course unfortunate for you or me, who might benefit if other people were excluded from Cal Poly, but you are the one acting in crass-personal self-interest, not the school.",

The CSU administrators--who are both the people directing the funding and one of the main reasons Cal Poly is being pushed to expand--don't get paid more.\n\nI agree, Cal Poly has a problem with contractors who are not particularly competent, and there are far too many administrators relative to teachers and support staff. However, these *individuals'* salaries do not increase as the school becomes larger. Nor, should I note, do random administrators, and least of all contractors, have any particular power in determining whether the school should grow. It's not obvious to me why any administrator would even prefer that there be more administrators.\n\nThat is why I find this argument nonsensical. The school is not an abstract entity with some magical brain that it uses to pursue financial gain. It is made up of individuals, and none of those individuals personally benefits from the school growing larger. So yes, no body--that is, no individual person--benefits financially from a larger school.",

I would like the college to admit as many students as it feasibly can while maintaining standards. If cal poly had 100k students next year but could house and educate them properly I wouldn't care and in fact I'd be happy for all the new people accepted. I just don't want the experience to be degraded by overadmititng without having facilities",

I simply don't consider the mild inconvenience of living in a slightly crowded dorm to be worth not accepting more people.\n\nThis is the first time you have brought up poor education, rather than poor facilities, which are secondary in importance but extremely expensive.",

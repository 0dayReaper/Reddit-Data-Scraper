Mix in the international students too. Considering that cal poly has about 5,000 students in each class, it\u2019s crazy how many people who are qualified or even over-qualified aren\u2019t getting in. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not the end of the world, you\u2019ll do fine wherever you end up.",

Meaning--an extra English elective. Check their website--they even recommend 5 years of science too I think. I don't like it because then there's less room in the schedule for other more interesting electives.",

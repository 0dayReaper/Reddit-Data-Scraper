    "postText": "I got accepted to honors and my roommate and I are debating whether to go into the honors housing or go to Yosemite/ sierra. I get yak has better amenities but it seems like they only have triples and quads/quints. Does the honors housing building have mostly those options cause I\u2019ve seen tours of doubles on YouTube in yak but the website doesn\u2019t say anything about it. From what I\u2019ve seen on the website Yosemite/sierra have doubles and triples but worse amenities",

I say that freshman aren\u2019t likely gonna get doubles just because there\u2019s very few and they go fast, but you pick your room. Mostly things don\u2019t differ in rooms, but I noticed that yak rooms have little mirrors in the closets while some rooms don\u2019t. Also definitely floor space and maybe amount of windows depending where in the building. And also storage space in doubles vs triples",

            "comment": "Housing in both yakitutu and SM/Yos will have mostly triples. The rooms in yakitutu are larger. There will also be a few (1 in 10?) rooms in yakitutu that are quintuples, but if you don\u2019t want to choose those you won\u2019t have to. There will be a few doubles in SM/Yos, but those are mostly reserved for people with disability accommodations and probably won\u2019t be available to you when you pick your rooms. I\u2019d say the biggest difference is that honors housing will be a lot quieter, which might be your preference or not. SM/Yos can be more social because of the common rooms right outside the bedrooms but sometimes the noise can get a little old. It depends a lot on who\u2019s on your floor.",

I had a nail through my sidewall, brought it in at like 4:40pm and they had a replacement (used) tire swapped on by 5:15 for like $30. \n\nThey really took care of me and stayed late to do so, for a good price, and acted like it was no big deal and they do it every day. Idk if they'll change an electric scooter tire, but if they can, they'll be happy to help for a reasonable price I bet.\n\nIdk anything about CoastRiders, but it's right next door and they do motor scooters and bikes so they may be able to help as a backup.",

            "comment": "I will copy and paste some info from a previous comment of mine for you, and give you some more ideas. Basically, TL;DR is that CP is the best Cal State for business and our median comp actually obliterates even UCI and UCSD for their business(or businessey) majors. Actually comes close to rivaling UCLA. There's pretty much no contest from a numbers perspective against SDSU, but we have to get a little deep here to highlight the real problems.\n\n&gt;Cal Poly\u2019s most recent graduate status report put [OCOB grads at a $66,500 median comp](https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/careerservices/1/images/new_exploreservices/graduate_status_report/2020-21%20Cal%20Poly%20Graduate%20Status%20Report%20-%20Orfalea%20College%20of%20Business.pdf) immediately after graduation. [SDSU averages $54K](https://business.sdsu.edu/admissions/stats) for Fowler. That\u2019s a difference of $12,500 already, and when you account that Cal Poly is using medians and SDSU is using averages, the difference is even bigger as average compensation is pretty much always higher than median. The difference is probably closer to $15K between the two schools for new grad comp. That\u2019s a huge difference and you\u2019d make a return on your debt in like 2 or 3 years, 5 years max. When you account for compensation growth, you\u2019ll on average blow away what you could\u2019ve done at SDSU. \n\n**However** I have one strong caveat for you.\n\nThe fact that you are going into marketing is the real concern. There's many problems with marketing, like:\n\n* You're not just competing with other marketing majors, but graphic communications, arts, humanities, etc. It's not like in accounting where pretty much your only competition is other accounting majors. Also, marketing is kinda viewed as the business side that a lot of these creative liberal arts types go to since many view it as the business role most applicable to them. The fact is that these candidates come from majors with historically terrible pay, so they drag down the pay in the market since they're willing to accept lower numbers while also increasing the competition. Thus, marketing is incredibly oversaturated.\n\n* There are very few good marketing programs in the nation with strong placements into real marketing jobs. One thing you'll find at a lot of marketing programs is that a vast majority of grads actually go into sales, and that sales is pretty much the only opportunity they have. This is also true here at Cal Poly. The vast, vast majority of individuals will go into mediocre sales roles. Some will land actual marketing jobs, but usually for underpaying small businesses. You're not going be surrounded by people who will be landing marketing jobs with the NFL or become marketing PMs at Google.\n\n* In addition to the mostly sales job opps as spoken of above, the marketing curriculum is even pushed towards sales. Just look at the concentration requirements, two of the 3 core classes are pretty much sales classes. There are some analytical classes, but the marketing department is understaffed so some of these classes are not offered often. In my experience, the marketing stereotype is true, and a vast majority of the people I've met in marketing do this concentration because they wanted to avoid the technical or mathematical rigor of concentrations like accounting, finance, IS, etc. As a result, you are not adequately taught an analytical mindset like you actually need and you don't have peers that push you to either. I know someone who was condescendingly called an overachiever for wanting to use R for a data analysis assignment instead of some terrible dumbed-down software they had. Some of my other friends in marketing are quite good with stats and coding and rant to me constantly about how terrible their classmates are. \n\nThis is about all I have for you. You're choosing the right school, but I don't particularly think you're choosing the right field and concentration. My recommendation to people who want to do marketing is to actually do IS or quant to learn basic analytical and statistics skills, so you're not just one of the millions of creatives who can't do any of the data and research work. It's much easier to learn the marketing stuff on the side and learn technical stuff at school than the other way around.",

Its overall a better business school, you end up w a salary of atleast 15k higher than SDSU upon graduation as well as having the option to damn near go anywhere you want whereas with SDSU im sure you\u2019ve heard the stigma of \u201conce you graduate from SDSU you will stay in San Diego for life\u201d which sucks tbh. Maybe bc I\u2019m from SD that I wanted something new but yeah lol. SLO\u2019s business school is more well known than SDSUs and generally bc of its learn by doing motto and approach to EVERYTHING having that hands on experience would make you a better candidate in the eyes of an employer bc you actually have done something rather than just sitting in class all day learning about marketing which is what you would probably be doing in San Diego",

Cal poly is higher up in salary because a lot of kids who go here already come from rich white families.

I remember hearing that Cal Polys's class size was relatively small at around 20-40 students depending on the class. Is this the case? Thank you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: thank you so much for your help!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I do see there are some classes in the PAC and I have no idea how large those get\n\nPretty much high school class sizes if not a little smaller or bigger",

            "comment": "Highly dependent on what level your class is. GenEds (aka history, psych, etc) are often about 125 people. Support classes (chem, physics, maths) run at about 40-50 students. Major classes are usually smaller, especially later on in the curriculum. The smallest class I\u2019ve been in is an 18 person major specific class. Most of the time my major classes are about 30. Honestly, most classes (other than the few large ones) feel like my high school classes. It\u2019s fairly easy to interact with professors in smaller classes. Most of the classrooms are similarly sized to my high schools.",

I had a few big lectures for lower-level GE classes (like TH 210) and for lower level support courses (CHEM 127/128/129 had large lectures but the labs were small group, same for the PHYS series) but once you're through that it's all smaller class sizes taught by the professors themselves",

At Cal Poly, you will almost always be taught by a professor, whereas in a lot of UC's or other big schools, you're gunna be taught by a lot of grad/teaching assistants. You may have a lab or two here that's taught by a GA, but almost every lecture/seminar will be taught by a real professor.",

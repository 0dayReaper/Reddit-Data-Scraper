The film tells the story of Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, the two men who charted the course of the spectacular rise and catastrophic demise of the world's first smartphone. Tickets are $25 for general admission and $20 for students.\n\nIf you haven't gotten your tickets for the event, you can do so online at [https://slofilmfest.org/events/openingnight/](https://slofilmfest.org/events/openingnight/?fbclid=IwAR0tPgjCOn5YKgqNvi47pe7UXeFFL9IE5TRLxWotM9i5kth2KZoXud48_Q8) or in person at our Box Office Headquarters at 851 Higuera st. We hope to see you there!",

            "comment": "It really depends on where your RLC ends up being placed, which won\u2019t be officially decided until all housing applications are finalized. It\u2019s more likely you\u2019ll be able to get a double if your RLC ends up in the Red Bricks or the Towers. If you\u2019re in yak\u0294it\u02b8ut\u02b8u or North Mountain, probably expect a triple. Overall you can\u2019t really count on anything for sure, but you can definitely try.",

            "comment": "My roommate and I wanted a double and was able to get one in the Red Bricks.  We just decided it was worth the risk to try for a double and if we didn\u2019t get one we  were ok going random with the 3rd roommate.  I lucked out and got my room selection appointment on the 2nd day midday.  If there are doubles available at the time you register just don\u2019t be picky\u2026grab it and secure the room.  If you  take too much time the system might slow down or crash and you might loose the double.  Your odds of getting a double are higher if your RLC ends up in Red bricks or Towers since there are not supposed to be any doubles in yak next year.  I actually wanted the older dorms because there is more storage even as triples compared to the new dorms.",

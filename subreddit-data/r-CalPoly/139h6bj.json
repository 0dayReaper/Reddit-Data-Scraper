I\u2019ve heard a lot about Cal Poly\u2019s \u201clearn by doing\u201d education and their emphasis on technical \u201cnuts and bolts\u201d work, but I want to learn some more details of what makes Cal Poly architecture unique (job opportunities, faculty, facilities, career services, etc.) I would love hear about any of your personal experiences!\n\nFor further context, my Cornell acceptance is a waitlist decision, so I won\u2019t have time to visit either college. A teacher of mine had students who studied architecture. One of them described Cal Poly\u2019s education as preparing one to become a cook, whereas Cornell\u2019s education prepares one to become a chef. It would be great if someone could support or refute this statement.",

            "comment": "Cornell teaches Starchitechts. If you're not one of them, you're not going to fit in.\n\nCal Poly assumes you're a regular person and will build you from the ground up in terms of technical and theoretical skills. CP teaches you current industry standards and practices. You also get more hands-on work compared to Cornell's program. CP makes you ready to work day one after graduation.\n\nI'd say it's also less depressing here than at Cornell (we don't need suicide nets), and there are fewer eccentric people here overall.\n\nIF you are one of those Starchitechts (if your family owns their own firm or something like that), Cornell is a definite choice. If you're not, it depends on whether you want to live in Ithica for 5 years or not.\n\nLast note, you need to learn how to cook before you can be a chef.",

            "comment": "First, I think you can and will be successful at both and I am going to assume you can afford both financially. But, as someone who went to Cornell (not architecture, but a first gen poc college student, studied stats) and my boyfriend attended Cal Poly architecture. My boyfriend is doing very well and currently works for a really nice global architecture firm. However, he even has said go to Cornell if you are taken off the waitlist.\n\n1. I think at any school you can find your group of people who you enjoy. As someone who is very much less privileged and went to a school full of privileged individuals, I 100% was capable of finding my own community of friends. I also loved my boyfriends friend and think they are amazing people, and they went to Cal Poly. So I REALLY don't think you should stress on a social vibe, or the stereotypes of \"how students behave\" in different schools.\n2. Ithaca actually reminded me a lot of SLO, in terms of small town vibes, college towns, nature, etc. Obviously weather is different, but if you do not mind the cold at all, I would consider Ithaca. I would not say its that isolated, I mean how often are college students just leaving college a semester? I was able to leave and go to NYC, DC, Philly during breaks. My bf would be able to leave and go to SF/LA probs just as often, so still similar in that vibe. However, in saying that, you are in school not vacation. So this should be a secondary thing to consider, as education I think comes first.\n3. I also would not say Cornell is depressing (unless you absolutely hate snow of any kind), the waterfalls are gorgeous, the winters are cold, but livable. The \"suicide\" issue is blown out of proportion due to the fact we do have waterfalls and cliffs, however, I believe we have a suicide rate that is close or less than average. \n4. We have great on-campus dining, several great libraries, a beautiful campus, really NICE dorms, study rooms in every building on campus, a nice town bus system, don't need a car, a good collegetown immediately off campus that most juniors/seniors live. Like I really enjoyed those things about Cornell.\n5. Lastly, I honestly think going to most colleges can acquire you the same knowledge as others, however, LETS BE REAL there are resources and a network that comes with going to an Ivy League. You would be attending if I am not mistaken the #1 undergrad architecture program in the USA. Like thats a really awesome achievement, and should be heavily considered! Going to Cornell has opened so many doors for me and my friends, that I am sure we could've gotten at state schools, etc, but having the doors wide-open from the jump is a huge plus.\n\nI hope whatever you decision you decide is best for you, I think you can be successful at both, But I am not going to downplay the achievements of going to Cornell.",

Ithaca is depressingly isolated from what I\u2019ve heard from friends who go there, but that depends heavily on how social you are. Students travel to NYC all the time, but my understanding is that, at least for architecture, you won\u2019t be there for academic reasons often, if ever. So consider it a weekend vacay spot, similar to how Santa Barbara/LA/SF would be a vacay spot for Poly. More importantly though, we\u2019re talking about 3+ months out of the year that you have to get a ton of warm clothes that you don\u2019t currently have as a California student. I personally love the idea of having a real winter but I chose Cal Poly bc I have the rest of my life to visit the east coast and didn\u2019t want to be there for 4 years, not to mention having to pay for moving fees / flights to get home for holidays, etc etc etc. cal poly gives you daily access to beaches, mountains, bays, has a great downtown scene, nearby megastore infrastructure, and just has an overall beach town vibe. Ithaca is the exact opposite, or so I\u2019d imagine.",

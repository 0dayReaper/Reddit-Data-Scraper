    "postText": "I recently got admitted into Cal Poly SLO as an English major but between submitting my application and now, I found a passion in business/marketing due to my involvement in a high school business club called DECA. \n\nIf I commit to Cal Poly SLO, I hope to switch to a business major and minor in English instead. I\u2019m aware that business is highly impacted and have heard that it is incredibly hard to switch majors. I truly would have applied as a business major had I found my interest then but am now caught in a difficult position. Do you think it would be impossible to switch into a business major from English? Also any thoughts on the English department at SLO? Thank you so much for any help.",

            "comment": "The changing major things is so overblown. I changed my major second quarter. Unless you want to switch into CS, SWE, or a couple other majors, you can definitely switch your major. It\u2019s just a bit more drawn out than at other schools. \n\nLook up \u201cChange of Major Cal Poly\u201d and you\u2019ll find the webpage detailing how to change one\u2019s major. AFAIK for business you need to keep a 3.3 GPA first quarter. Then you\u2019ll probably enter an ICMA for a quarter or two, and if you meet it\u2019s requirements (which usually involves getting certain grades in certain classes), then it\u2019ll be signed off by department heads and you\u2019ll officially be a business major.",

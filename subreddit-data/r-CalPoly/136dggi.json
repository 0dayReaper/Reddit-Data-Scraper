    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a prospective freshman going to SLO, I got in for biochem but I plan on switching to a stats major asap. I was wondering if passing my AP Stats exam will help catch up for the quarter I would miss taking my major classes for biochem. \n\nI saw that AP stats only lets students skip either stats 130 or the 200 level stats, none of which are needed for the major. Should I worry about this, or should I treat my first quarter like I\u2019m just fulfilling my GEs?",

They should be able to help you decide what to take, and they may even be able to change some of your block schedule so it fits more with a stats first quarter than biochem. (I\u2019m not a stats major so I can\u2019t speak to the ap exam but that\u2019s my advice)",

            "comment": "Passing your AP exam would definitely help, but there are other ways to make sure you are on track as well. For one the other comment recommends reaching out to an advisor which I would definitely recommend. There likely is some overlap between the math you have to take as bio chem and stats (at least in the first year) so I don\u2019t think you would lose much time if you plan things out well. I am a stat major here at poly, if you have any other questions about the major feel free to dm me.",

I took it 5+ years ago at a different college so I\u2019m curious what everyone at Cal Poly remembers!\n\nPlease mention your major, how long ago you took 202, your grade, anything you think could have been done differently, your favorite assignment, things you liked from your instructor, etc.\n\nThanks in advance for sharing :)",

            "comment": "SE, took it in winter of 2017, got an A. I remember it being almost entirely an introduction of data structures and their  strengths/weaknesses/associated algorithms. We did everything in python when applicable but I remember it was more note taking and lecture than coding (although for this class I dont think that was a bad thing). I liked being able to be exposed to structures I hadn't used or considered yet, but felt like we didn't see the advantages as much as we discussed them. Might be worth setting up mock problems where one DS would excel over others and show real time/memory complexity comparisons. Animated visualizations would have been supremely helpful.",

            "comment": "CPE, I took it in 2020 with Hatalsky. I did well in the class. I remember a lot of big O notation for operations with different structures, as well as time complexity of code snippets. There was a little bit about recursion at the beginning. From the projects I remember Huffman coding which I liked the most. I thought Hatalsky did a good job of teaching, I had no problems with it. Other than that I just remember making classes for the data structures in Python.",

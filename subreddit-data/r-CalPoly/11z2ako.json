Yea that sounds about right if you haven't taken student loans.\n\nAlso, if you have accepted loans, you can usually ignore the amount due until after all financial aid for the quarter has been given out at which point the amount you owe will be adjusted (overflow will be sent to your bank account if it's on-file).",

I used the city bus (free with your Poly ID card), walked, and/or biked, so I sure as shit did not spend the $1,089 per year they estimate for Transportation. I also used the library course reserves, interlibrary loan, found PDFs, or otherwise avoided buying textbooks wherever I could so I absolutely did not spend the $1,089 they estimate for Books and Materials either\n\nSo, I would double check vs the CoA to figure out what your actual shortfall is vs your budget-related shortfall. Idk if you're in-state or out-of-state, that impacts the costs significantly",

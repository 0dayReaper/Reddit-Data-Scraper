    "postText": "Hey everyone I\u2019m not really to sure where to ask this but I am currently a community college student who got accepted into Cal Poly for fall 2023 transfer. Basically I\u2019m rethinking transferring that early due to issues renewing my fasfa. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll be able to renew my fasfa prior to the the start of the term. Would it be possible to change your term transfer? I do know that Cal Poly does accept spring transfers, would changing somehow be possible?",

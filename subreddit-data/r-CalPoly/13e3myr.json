However, in emergency situations that require the specialized skills of a Student Employee, it is permissible for a Student Employee to work up to 30 hours per week. The 30 hour work week is permitted for a limited duration of time.\"\n\nEven if someone had two jobs on campus, they couldn't work more than 20 weekly hours total unless under whatever emergency situations Cal Poly has defined.",

(Hence that 20hr. Max req.) We are all students first, our priorities should lie on course work first, making money second. If you need a job to support yourself at college, get an actual (part time) job. One that has you listed as an employee, not as a student employee. The city of slo has ample retail and fast food jobs available to choose from. (They also pay a fair bit more) \nI don\u2019t see unionizing student workers to amount to anything but an increase in overall cost for every student, which would be significantly counterintuitive.",

They are all doing highly skilled work that requires years of training for barely above minimum wage. Some of them feel like they should get a raise. They go to their boss and explain their thoughts. Instead of dealing with giving them the raise they deserve, the boss decides it is easier to fire them and find other people to work for the same wage.\n\nUnion situation:\n\n50 employees. Low wage. Some of them feel they should earn more. They talk to their coworkers, who agree with them. They decide to form a union, then go to the boss saying they all want a raise. Now what? They have bargaining power. The boss can\u2019t fire all 50 of them, so they can now discuss a raise with their boss. They also can\u2019t go on strike for too long because they need work, and it might get to the point where the boss does just end up firing them. \n\nThis is just a small part of the reasons why unions are so beneficial for any level of job.\n\nAlso your comment about the pay makes me feel like you are of the opinion that food service/customer service jobs don\u2019t deserve more than minimum wage. Firstly, I\u2019d like to see you try working at a coffee shop and see if you maintain that opinion. Secondly, from experience, I have seen people in minimum wage jobs out in more effort, attention, and skill into minimum wage jobs than people with $30/hr office jobs.",

Assuming a wage of $16/hr, someone working the maximum of 20hr/week with a (fairly low for SLO) rent and utilities of $1000/month would take over 3 weeks to pay that $1000, leaving them with about $280 a month for supplies, food, transportation, personal care, etc. That\u2019s barely livable. So imagine if you can\u2019t work the 20hr a week, or your rent is more than $1000, or many other circumstances. That is why the wage should be higher",

This is a significant reason why manufacturing is generally unionized while lower-wage jobs typically are not. \n\nThe likely result of student unions is that there are more higher-paid students, but fewer paid student positions overall.

There is little to no evidence of pay raises in low-skill low-profit service industries. Your anecdote is not data.\n\nNot to mention, unions can only raise benefits to the level of marginal profit of the least profitable worker. Beyond that, the company is losing money, so it either fires workers or will simply refuse to accept any pay raises beyond that point.\n\nThe profit per worker in manufacturing is very high, because manufacturing is a high value-added industry. The union can bargain to take some of the value added in manufacturing and redistribute it from the owners of the building and machinery (capital) and the employer (who may or may not be the same person) to the worker. The value added by a grocery worker to a grocery store is razor-thin. Grocery store margins range between 1-3%.\n\nAssuming the case that the 3% are all non-unionized and the 1% all unionized (which is unlikely, there are almost certainly many more important differences), you union should have given you around a 2% raise. Union dues are 1-2%.",

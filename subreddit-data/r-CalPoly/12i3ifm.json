(either saying cal poly is better than ucsd or vice versa) ik at the end of the day it is my decision, but my mom wants me to go to a UC and she is the one who would be paying for all my college funds so is it really fully my decision?!? yes my bf has committed to cal poly but he isn\u2019t pressuring me to go there. if anything he wants me to go to ucsd since he thinks it\u2019s a better school for me but i really don\u2019t know. long distance would be so hard on our relationship if i do go to ucsd as well. pls help. let me know what i should do \ud83d\ude2d",

My friends who went to ucs had an unnecessarily harder time since their coursework was more theoretical. Employers don't value a uc engineering degree more than a cal poly one. Plenty of engineering companies gladly recruit out of cal poly.",

College should be both an investment in yourself as much as something you enjoy going through, no matter how horrible classes are.",

            "comment": "I was honestly in a similar situation with you up until a couple days ago. I got accepted into the Statistics major in both schools and plan to minor in data science. I also got accepted into Revelle college at UCSD. I also live 45 minutes away from UCSD, most of my friends are either going to UCSD, SDSU, or staying at home, so I get where you are coming from living somewhere new vs. the familiarity of home.\n\nFor your issues concerning choosing UCSD, I would say to do a lot of research on the school before choosing! I had the opportunity to go to Triton Days on Saturday, so I'll give you a few things that I learned from that.\n\nFor Revelle, the college was founded by Roger Revelle, whose goal was to create a well rounded student. In comparison, to the other seven colleges in UCSD, the GE's in Revelle are a lot more, for lack of a better term, rigorous. You would have to view their GE's with an open mind tbh, especially with their required HUM sequence, but with a talk with some current students at Revelle , they enjoyed it since it gave them a break from their major course work, though I know a lot of people still hate it. (I believe you have to do 5, 5-9 page essays about different works each quarter, and I believe there are 4 or 5 classes within the HUM sequence, so rip) I'm sure if you have a lot of AP credit, you would be able to knock off a decent chunk of your GE's, not the HUM sequence tho. One of mine knocked off an entire year! :)\n\nDespite it being known as \"Socially Dead,\" there are also a lot of different clubs and orgs that you could choose from to make friends in. The experience is what you make of it tbh.\n\nAlso, for your concerns about the beach, UCSD is literally known and home to Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO), big on marine research. Meaning, beaches are everywhere, and what San Diego is practically known for. There is a beach I believe 10 minutes walking distance from the campus, but access to transport in general in SD is fairly easier than SLO, at least from my experience. The campus at UCSD is also really nice, in comparison, and more what I was looking for, which is why I considered it an option in the first place\n\nBut, I overall chose SLO over UCSD since it provided a better curriculum and learning philosophy better suited to how I want to learn, the major I chose, and the field I want to go into. It is a lot more applied, compared to UCSD's theoretical approach to Statistics. It also has much smaller class sizes compared to UCSD's, where they have mega lectures of up to \\~600 people (at least in the department of mathematics).\n\nI also chose it because location was important to me. I wanted to leave San Diego more than anything. I was/am still a bit apprehensive about it though. I am coming in Fall 2023, knowing literally no one and in the process of finding a roommate, haha. It is a lot different and a massive change to what I'm used to, but I'm very excited!\n\nHopefully my experience helps you, at least a little bit! I would definitely search for job prospects coming out of UCSD compared to Cal Poly, that also helped me a lot. Also, look how each school tackles the curriculum for your major! Good luck on your research and have fun choosing!  Can't go wrong with either of them imo. o7\n\nsorry for the long post btw, wanted to post this cuz i found something like this going through this process, being first gen and all.",

            "comment": "Hey! I went to undergrad at Cal Poly (with the final two schools I was deciding between being Cal Poly and UCSD) and I'm currently a graduate student at UCSD, so I might be able to provide some advice.\n\nRegarding the ranking/prestige stuff, in general Cal Poly is \"better\" than most UCs though I suspect UCSD is \"better\" than Cal Poly for your field, but honestly I wouldn't worry about it if you plan to stay in California, and in general what you do in college matters much more than where you go to college. \n\nRegarding social stuff, it's entirely possible to have no social life at Cal Poly/to be extremely social at UCSD. Being with friends/BF/having a support network especially if you aren't the most socially inclined is a big deal, but keep in mind that people change throughout college and often high school friendships/relationships don't last. On the flipside, college can be a fantastic chance for you to grow as a person and learn more about yourself and the world, which you could deprive yourself of if you try to stay too comfortable. In general I think this is a huge Pro for Cal Poly, college can be extremely rough especially for first gen students, and being around people you already know/can get support from helps a ton. Remember, getting accepted is just the first step, you then have to focus and work hard for 4+ years and graduate for it to matter, and unfortunately many students drop out, most in their first year. Also, some of my worst experiences in college came from living with nightmarish roommates, which can likewise negatively affect your ability to succeed with academics.\n\nRegarding the campus/location, I think Cal Poly is much nicer. UCSD is much closer to the beach (you can walk to it vs having to drive at Poly), but again I don't think this should make enough of a different to be a deciding factor. Also regarding food, it's true that UCSD is significantly better, but Cal Poly gets more hate than it deserves, you can just buy your own food off campus even when you have a meal plan, and again I don't think this should be a significant factor.\n\nRegarding academics, if you want to be a clinical psychologist, I believe you'll need a graduate degree, so where you go for undergrad/what you do doesn't matter so much. While UCSD has prestige, usually that comes heavily out of research activity and money flow into the school, and as an undergrad that doesn't effect you much. Between my experience at the two schools, Cal Poly is much more of an actual school where effort is put in by the teachers/structure to educate students, education quality is better, there are smaller class sizes, and there are more resources for help you if you need it. Where at UCSD, you're treated more as a source of income to fuel the graduate research, and you aren't a priority for the departments/teachers. And while classes do cover more information, that just makes them harder while the school provides you with less support. It is true that if you want to do research UCSD has much higher quality researching going on and in general UCSD has more resources/scholarships/organizations/seminars/talks/etc, but the issue is that many undergrads don't have access to those highlight of the school anyway.\n\nRegarding your mom's expectations, you might want to have a conversation about why she wants you to attend a UC/how much is genuinely what she wants vs your possibly incorrect perception of her expectations. Does she think you'll get a better education at a UC than a CSU (probably the opposite is true)? Does she put a premium on name recognition and/or not know much else about what separates the schools? Does she want to be able to brag about your success to people, and she thinks people will be more impressed by UCSD but not by Cal Poly? I think it would be helpful to know where exactly she's coming from, and to both communicate your priorities to her and help clear up any misconceptions she may have about the schools.\n\nOverall, I think you should go to Cal Poly because I think the differences between the schools are small/shouldn't matter for everything except friends/support network where Cal Poly has a massive lead.",

Some important things to consider: 1, the long distance relationship will be tough and commuting to see each other will be tough if you go to UCSD. 2, research at SLO will be better which sounds like something you might be interested in because you will have the opportunity to design and lead your own projects rather than following a graduate student. 3, the food at UCSD is far superior to Poly and always will be but you get used to it and making your own. 4, Revelle's GEs suck and it is very difficult for people to graduate in 4 with all the extra classes you have to take. \n\nI have absolutely loved my time at Cal Poly, and having spent a LOT of time at UCSD, would choose poly any day of the week.",

I'd say the big plus on Cal Poly is smaller classes and friendlier closer knit vibe. More attention to the emotional needs of the students. UCSD is a bad ass place with a lot of super smart students and great course offerings. But you're a little more on our own to figure things out socially. Cal Poly's Learn By Doing is geared to set you up for success in getting into a career. So perhaps that counter-weights the specificity of major that you like about UCSD. But the big thing is CONGRATULATIONS. I know how competitive it is and it's awesome your hard work has paid off.",

UCSD is a pretty prestigious school, but that doesn\u2019t mean you will be more sought after or even learn more. \n\nLike many said, don\u2019t choose a school based off of a high school relationship. You will both change a lot as you move into your early 20s. There\u2019s a chance that things don\u2019t work out or your priorities deviate. You don\u2019t wanna be at a uni just because of your bf. Also, some could see going into college with an active in person relationship as a con, since it could make socializing more difficult. Your friends and experiences could be single-handedly determined by your bf or vice versa, even if it\u2019s unintentional and not malicious.\n\nCal Poly doesn\u2019t have as much prestige since we don\u2019t really put out much cutting edge research. UCSD has been home to many groundbreaking research projects and findings. This raises the schools prestige. Cal poly is first and foremost a teaching school, so it lacks this element. If you want to do research, and pursue that masters/phd, you may experience less research at ucsd (the research here is undergrad focused), but you may develop connections with professors that can get you into high up places in academia. \n\nIn my opinion, cal poly is better set up to teach undergrads, with smaller class sizes, a less competitive classroom environment, and grueling, but rewarding work. UCSD will still be a place you can get a top notch education, but I think it does suffer from the issues that many other large research schools face. \n\nSocial wise, I cannot comment. It would be unconstructive and ranty. I will say that slo is a fun town to be in, albeit a little isolated if you are a city slicker like myself. The PWI is something I don\u2019t encounter as much in class (engineering is more racially diverse on average and I\u2019m white). However the sea of white people present at the school was pretty shocking to me at first (grew up in a diverse neighborhood). I find it hard to relate with a lot of people here.",

            "comment": "Why is everyone talking about engineering when your major is clinical psychology / sociology lol\n\nI did my undergrad at a UC, worked for 4 years, at CalPoly now for my masters in STEM. My takeaway from being at a UC and having friends in the CSU system (and now being here) is that the CSU teachers have a much more passionate and stronger desire to teach and educate than the UC professors I had did.\n\nA lot of my friends coming from CSU had stronger curriculums and hands on experience in their classes.\n\nMy differing experience at a UC was that I had plenty of research opportunities within my major, and in a larger city, plenty more opportunities for internships, networking professionally, and was able to make up the experience deficit externally.\n\n\nHowever, one aspect of CalPoly I thoroughly enjoy is that I don\u2019t need a car here, even though I have one. At UCSD you WILL need a car to get anywhere, on the plus side there is SOOO MUCH for you to do there. I have friends who went to UCSD and they didn\u2019t complain about it being socially dead, I went to UCI which is a notorious commuter school - at the end of the day, the experience you get out of college is what you put into it. Get out of your comfort zone even just a little, and it\u2019ll make socializing easier. \n\nIt IS really sweet to walk around CalPoly and see how easy it is for friends to bump into each other because the graduating class sizes are smaller compared to a UC, and the campus is smaller too - I think that\u2019s one of the aspects of CalPoly that is very special. SLO is a small town so it\u2019s cute seeing so many people bump into each other organically too :) \n\n\nCareer / major wise, do your research and see which program aligns more with what you like and want to do. See what the professors at the schools are researching and how they research - they\u2019re the people who are going to guide you and point you in the directions of your career and future. \n\n\nLong distance is hard, but think of the fun excursions you both will have visiting each other - you get to see what SLO life is like, and your partner will get to enjoy SD. My friends, family, and partner are in SoCal, it is hard, I do miss them, but the freedom to rediscover yourself somewhere new is an experience I\u2019d gift to everyone if I could.",

And that\u2019s only the case in certain majors that are impacted like engineering; other majors like English are actually quite easy to get into. It\u2019s hurt by the fact that you can apply just like any other CSU; all you need is stats and nothing else. It\u2019s all algorithm-based. No personal essays of any kind. So there\u2019s no way to filter out personalities that way. I would think that the easy, impersonal application process means that Cal Poly students on average would not be quite as intellectually bright or hardworking as the average students at a comparable or better UC school. They\u2019d be a bit more like the students in other CSU\u2019s than in comparable UC\u2019s. I have sort of noticed this difference having walking around Cal Poly for a few years and having visited a few UCs in the past. I could be wrong, but I heard that the CAED majors, as well regarded as they might be, have an acceptance rate that is quite a bit higher than engineering. I have met a good number of people here who got like a 3.6 or 3.7 GPA in high school, or just don\u2019t seem like that intellectually motivated in general, like I couldn\u2019t see these people making it into a school that\u2019s any better. This doesn\u2019t mean that Riverside or Merced wouldn\u2019t be worse in certain cases though. And acceptance rate is overall a poor metric for how good a school is. It means less than you think unless you\u2019re doing a general comparison between like Ivy League/elite schools and less prestigious state universities.",

There wasn't a time limit on it so you had from friday to sunday. There was sometimes problems from the book due and a weekly 5 question quiz. Since it is philosophy it can be confusing but I enjoyed it more than I think I would have if I took english. You need to practice and make sure you understand the book/lecture slides because you can't look stuff up. It's mostly wrong or too in depth of answers. He is a great person and teacher imo. I get that you asked for people who took it over the summer, but in case no one answers,  here is something! I can't imagine it being wildly different from the in person 10 week class",

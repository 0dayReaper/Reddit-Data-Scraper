    "postText": "hello! i\u2019m currently in a dilema trying to pick where to go to college and my top two choices are cal poly slo and ucsc, both for computer science. i would really appreciate any opinions/information/insight you can offer. i\u2019ve written some points out below on things i\u2019m comparing (not written in accordance to importance, just whichever factors came to mind first)\u2026\n\n**aid:**\n- cal poly slo: 12k/yr \n- ucsc: 6k/yr\n\nneither of these prices are too crazy but obviously one of them is quite a bit cheaper. my mom has been telling me to not worry about which one is cheaper when choosing which i understand but can\u2019t help but do. i\u2019ll definitely have to take out loans either way. \n\n**campus + people:**\n\nlike most people, i really really love ucsc\u2019s campus. i love the overall vibes there and i\u2019ve heard the people are super chill! also i think there\u2019s a good diversity in the people there which is great in general. obviously college can be a miserable time occasionally but might as well be miserable in a pretty place, right? (i\u2019m JOKING\u2026but not really)\n\nso clearly cal poly slo\u2019s campus is not as pretty (like at all) and their main selling point is that it\u2019s right next to the beach but i do not like the beach\u2026and before you say, I KNOW santa cruz is right next to the beach but they have a FOREST !!!!! as far as the people, cal poly slo is known for being VERY predominantly white which i\u2019m actually a little concerned about. i\u2019m a latina and i\u2019ve literally only ever gone to school in predominantly hispanic schools so i feel like college will be a major culture shock. also, ANYTIME i see a video of someone who loooves cal poly slo\u2026they\u2019re white. i\u2019ve seen quite a lot of videos of poc at cal poly slo talking about racism  they\u2019ve faced or just feeling very alone. \n\ni know this should be a huge factor but it\u2019s still something i\u2019m thinking about. \n\n**cs program:**\n\ni think slo probably has the advantage here. they focus on \u201clearn by doing\u201d which i can respect and definitely admire. i think that\u2019ll be very useful in preparing me in a career. i\u2019ve also heard it\u2019s pretty easy to land jobs after graduation or internships since a lot of companies recruit from here. \n\ni\u2019ve also heard mostly good things about ucsc\u2019s comp sci program. apparently its pretty chill and it\u2019s not crazy competitive which i think is awesome. apparently its also quite easy to get a job after graduation. i\u2019ve heard that the lower division classes aren\u2019t as the best but the higher level classes are great. \n\nmy main point making me want to go to slo is their cs program just cause i\u2019ve heard it\u2019s so good. and it\u2019s not like ucsc\u2019s is bad, but i think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s not quite as good as slo.\n\n**housing:**\n\nnot too much to say here besides the fact that i know ucsc\u2019s housing is a mess. both schools pretty much guarantee housing your first year. \n\n**ap credit:**\n\nok so this is something else i\u2019ve been thinking about quite a bit. i currently have credit for 5 ap classes and i\u2019m pretty sure i can pass the exam for 3 more in may. \n\ni think i can transfer my ap credit easier at santa cruz than at slo? im not completely informed on this topic but if i would be able to use those credits that would be great. i\u2019m not sure how helpful they could be so some more information on this would be greatly appreciated !\n\n**final thoughts:**\n\ni feel like people are gonna say the decision is obvious but it\u2019s not completely for me. i think each school has their pros and cons and i know the biggest factor i should focus on is the quality of the program. but yea, any insight would be great :\u2019)",

            "comment": "You sound like you're more passionate about UCSC from a gut-level perspective. If so, go there. Otherwise, you will be filled with doubts (and perhaps regrets) if you go to SLO.\n\nBut to be precise, SLO CS is a much stronger program. Full stop. It has better career placement, and students are collaborative. I have a relative in SLO CS right now. \n\nCollege isn't solely about school though. The life experience itself is equally important. If chosen and lived skillfully, your college experience will be one of the best periods of your life.",

            "comment": "Read through this sub and you'll find a bunch of responses showing that employers, especially in California, will take Cal Poly grads over basically any UC. I think that the \"learn by doing\" philosophy is the main reason for this. You WILL get more hands on experience here than at a UC. \n\nThat being said, a lot of your points are valid! As someone who was deciding between ucsc and cal poly this time last year, I had a lot of concerns about the lack of diversity and location of slo. Yes, the campus isn't the *best* and definitely not as pretty as ucsc, but the nature of the surrounding area makes up for that for me. \n\nThe biggest deal breaker between ucsc and cal poly for me, however, was housing. UCSC has the largest rate of homelessness out of every UC, and I didn't want to have to pay Silicon Valley prices for rent. My major at Cal Poly doesn't have guaranteed housing second year like CS (so you're set for two years at least!), but finding housing wasn't hard (if you're on top of it). \n\nBut don't let me decide for you. I'm just laying out the reasons I decided on Cal Poly of UCSC. At the end of the day, go wherever you feel the most comfortable going!",

            "comment": "hi, my brother goes to ucsc for cs. i'd definitely choose slo over ucsc for these reasons:\n\n* the housing crisis is way worse at ucsc than just \"a mess\". his roommate literally had to leave school for a quarter because he couldn't find housing. plus, it seems like money might be a big factor for you. housing is incredibly expensive in sc compared to slo. dont get me wrong, slo is expensive as well, but a shared double in sc runs for around $1.2k compared to around $900 here. public transportation is also really bad so you're kinda forced to get a car, while its better + more organized here.\n* he's had a lot of trouble finding internships because the student body is large + the school doesn't have the same \"prestige\" as schools like cal poly. ik it sucks that prestige is a factor when, like you said, the classes are good, but its definitely affected him and most of his classmates\n* the learn by doing way of teaching here seems way better than whats offered at ucsc, especially for engineering majors. my brother didn't take a hands-on coding course w/ big projects until the end of soph year, while the first class you'll most likely take, csc 101, has you jump right into coding + doing insightful projects\n* as a poc, i've personally found slo fine. i was like you and almost turned down slo bc i was worried about the stigma and racism, but i think there are a lot of really great resources (culture clubs, multicultural engineering program, dorms specified by ethnic groups if you wanna choose that) that are offered. that being said, there are definitely racist people here lmao, but they've never openly been aggressive/spoken out about it with any other pocs i know.\n* ap credit is standard everywhere. don't worry about that\n* slo isn't that ugly lol!! the cs building definitely is, but i've come to appreciate the nature we have, the nearby hiking, and our cute + nearby downtown area. that being said, i'm like you and prefer ucsc's campus haha.\n\ni'm not saying \"CHOOSE CAL POLY OR ELSE!\", i know you have a lot of personal factors that makes ucsc stand out. these are just comparative pts i've found, especially after talking with my brother who's a cs junior at ucsc. hope this helps!",

            "comment": "Parent perspective here. My son is a senior at Cal Poly's CS program so you can guess that I am a proponent of the school. However I have two other sons, the oldest graduated from USC with  finance/accounting degrees and the youngest is a CS major at USC in his second year.\n\nI really love Cal Poly for a number of reasons. I think the school and surrounding area is beautiful with lots of outdoor activities to participate in. You may not like the beach but there is hiking, biking, etc in the hills and beaches around the area. The student body, although somewhat homogenous seem, for the most part,  friendly and supportive.\n\nCal Poly's CS program is very strong. My son recently spent summer in Seattle interning for Amazon as a software development engineer intern. Great experience and I think CP prepared him well for the rigorous interview process. (Hoping this tough job market doesn't hinder his job prospects when he graduates this June).\n\nHousing is tight everywhere but you should be able to find housing fairly easily. \n\nAs others have said it sounds like you are leaning towards UCSC but you're young and this time of your life is meant to grow and experience new things. Maybe Cal Poly is just outside of your comfort zone to be life changing? I can't answer that but hope you find what you are looking for.",

Ultimately you have to spend 4 years of your life there, it\u2019s so much more than just choosing a school. I think both are really good options, it sounds to me you\u2019re leaning towards Santa Cruz. I loved SLO and the learning environment there BUT I think your best choice is to just listen to your gut. If there\u2019s something telling you SC is more your vibe then you should pick it.",

I personally think cal poly's cs program is stronger and might lead to better opportunities earlier in your career. That being said, of course if you are good at what you do, whatever that ends up being, you will be able to succeed no matter where you go to college. \n\nI don't think you want to be unhappy for four years at a school you don't like just for better graduating prospects, and it sounds like you like the feel of UCSC more than SLO. Can't really speak to your concerns about racism and related issues seeing as I'm a white guy lol, I know there is a Latino learning community you can join for first year housing to meet others with similar backgrounds to your own if that's a priority for you. My friend was in that and he really enjoyed it, you can [read more here](http://www.housing.calpoly.edu/content/res_life/living_learning). \n\nIn terms of the cs programs themselves, I personally think I've had more luck/success than my friends at UCSC, they just went through a whole ordeal where two of the cs professors tried to fail as many students as possible before they retired which my friends got caught up in (those profs are gone now so don't let that affect your decision . I've only had good experiences with cs profs here, but honestly I think that's more down to luck and planning with [polyratings](http://polyratings.dev) than anything else. \n\nIf you have any questions about either cs program feel free to ask.",

I am not planning on working much so housing cost has me worried. I\u2019m looking to rent a unfurnished room long term. And I have a car so I don\u2019t mind driving 20 minutes. Any recommendations? Or advise on housing?",

The Cal Poly Housing page on FB is a great resource. Though keep in mind that lots of people are using it too! Also, the bus is free with your student ID.",

Nice neighborhood, no parties, 475 sqr ft studio with washer dry, AC, and all amenities for $1975/mo.\n\nEdit: I was looking all over before I moved down here. But after 2 quarters at Cal poly I can unequivocally say that paying the premium to be in SLO is worth it.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone. I was recently admitted as an English major and I\u2019m having a tough time trying to decide between going to Cal Poly or settling for Community College. One thing that worries me is how much it costs. I know that the price of Cal Poly is a pretty good bargain compared to other schools, with the quality of education being on par with many top UCs while enjoying the benefits of smaller class sizes, but i can go two years for free at CC. Is there any way i can get more aid while at college? Does the cost go down a little after freshman year, aside from housing (moving off-campus after freshman year). I attended open-house and it was an amazing experience, and my heart was set on going to Cal Poly, but the economically conscious side of me says community college is better. I\u2019ve also thought that if i go to a top UC after CC, I would probably spend more money in two years than four years at Cal Poly. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, sorry for the rambling, i just don\u2019t have much time left to make a decision.",

            "comment": "Cal poly has scholarships you can apply to and there are various websites for finding generic scholarships to apply for for any school. Other than that you can get grants from FAFSA obviously. If you get enrolled in CP Scholars that comes with another scholarship I think. Keep in mind some scholarships have requirements you have to meet like being a full-time student or keeping of academic probation. Cal Poly is never going to beat free CC cost wise, you just have to decide for yourself if you're okay with all the first and second year stuff you'll miss out on. \n\nMost people will attest they met people important to the rest of their college experience during that period and it's harder but not impossible for transfers to make those connections when the nontransfers are already settled in a certain amount. For me I only had one person I really kept up with all four years, but COVID happened too in there. Connections aren't just a social thing because networking is super important for getting those first good jobs out of college when you have no experience. \n\nYou also have to think about your headspace now and what it could be two years from now. If right now you feel motivated to study hard and meet new people and get involved in clubs etc, I would use that because you may lose some motivation grinding at CC. On the other hand if you think you'll respond negatively to everything changing if you go straight to Cal Poly, CC first is a good way to ease into all these life changes cuz you have a history to build off. Also your living situation matters a lot, like I have a good relationship with my parents, but I can't stand if they're partying at 3am and I need to sleep for something big the next morning. For me it's a lot healthier to live on my own even though the costs are obviously a lot higher",

            "comment": "There are pros and cons to both.\n\nThe pros of community college is it is cheaper, you can often live at home, and for lower division work, the quality of education is just as good or better than that of a university. In California, communities colleges are usually on the semester, which is good for math and science oriented subjects but can drag on for liberal arts and humanities. Though you get to know your professors better.\n\nThe cons are, there are not nearly as many opportunities in any respect at a community college. Most of them have little, if any social scene, and few active clubs. People tend to clear out after classes and those you meet you will soon part ways with as they finish their certificate program or transfer or drop out. Many scholarships and internship opportunities require you be in a degree program and at a four year institution, and community colleges often don't meet that criteria. \n\nAt universities, on the other hand, the campus is often bustling and the opportunities can be significant, socially, academically, professionally, and with extracurriculars. You are more likely to have opportunities to network and form friendships that could last a lifetime and help you in your career later, and Cal Poly at least has a large number of clubs and extracurricular activities in which students are active in. \n\nIf you are worried about cost, you may qualify for various programs in addition to any aid you get through FAFSA you can also look in to the EOPs and TRIO programs\n\n[https://eop.calpoly.edu/](https://eop.calpoly.edu/)\n\nhttps://www.bestcolleges.com/blog/federal-trio-programs/",

They often can lead you to more scholarships and ideas. It\u2019s a small department student-wise, and they like having plenty of students filling the desks. Just be courteous and respectful of their time.",

For me attending Community College was the best decision I ever made. I went to Community College, and each semester I would receive up to 5K in grants, scholarships which I would pocket.",

            "comment": "hi! i'm in the same boat as you as I'm also a recently admitted english major deciding between Davis and Cal Poly. I've been trying to reduce the cost of college because I don't qualify for many grants like the cal grant or the pell grant. I did qualify for the middle class scholarship which was around $2200 which was less than what I was offered at Davis, but still better than nothing.\n\nI have been applying to outside scholarships that are more local (like from my high school and city) to help reduce the costs. CalOPPS does also offer a teaching volunteer program that gives you about $700 a month if you apply (called College Corps) while being a student at SLO. They also have it for the UCs too. I'm not sure if you want to become a teacher, but I've also been looking into applying because I want to become a teacher.  My sister also went to SLO and was an RA which reduced the cost for her as she didn't really apply for scholarships.\n\nI think that you will find many opportunities to figure it out because the bulk of the price is mainly housing.  Being an RA or renting helps reduce the price at SLO from what my sister and her friends experienced.\n\nI was able to reduce my price tag to about $17k when originally it would have been $31k without financial aid and $22.6k with the middle class scholarship and another scholarship that I got.\n\nI'm not sure if this helps, but I think it does put into perspective how to reduce the cost of attendance.",

There are positives of greek life despite the negatives like lifelong friendships,  philanthropies,etc. Sure greek life isnt for everyone but for some people greek life genuinely helps them in their life and are we supposed to abolish greek life for them? . I would agree that the culture of greek life and college should change and giant parities like this would still happen regardless if greek life existed or not.

Who gives af?\n\nAnd it's outside so...\n\nPpl were rioting outside last spring/summer before any mitigation for this virus was in place at all, and there were more people in the riots (I saw the massive CP riots during lockdown). No one here was pissed that those people weren't social distancing.\n\nLet people do what they're going to do, and stop raising your blood pressure over it. I'm sure all of ya'll have better things to worry about than this. Go study for finals (something you can control), and it will be what it will be.",

And that's before you factor in all the snogging and groping.\n\n4) \"Riots?\" Really? There were certainly annoying protests, but SLO had no riots worthy of the name. As for those protests, last I remember, a hell of a lot more people wore masks. Also, what mitigation measures? Do you think anybody there was vaccinated? I doubt it. The hot summer air made for better mitigation than anything at the fuckshow we all witnessed. Even if everything was the same, at least the rioters can claim some moral highground (you don't have to agree with it) better than \"let's get wasted bro.\"\n\n5) \"Let people do what they're going to do\" is an attitude appropriate when the consequences fall squarely on the individual. If you want to cut off your own penis and use it as a dildo, go ahead. If you want to do something that will ultimately lead to the deaths of others, you deserve all the hate that's coming to you. Make no mistake, people *will* die because of this. \n\n6) It will be what it will be, and some of us will remember who did their duty and who said \"fuck my elderly neighbors let's get wasted.\" The latter can go fuck themselves.",

Not only is this the wrong hill to die on, it's *not* a hill you will die on.\n\nAccording to the CDC as of like, last week, 281 people between 18-29 have died from 'rona in California. In 2017, 725 people ages 15-24, and 735 people ages 25-34 died in traffic fatalities (ped-bike-car-motorcycle), [according to the CHP.](https://www.chp.ca.gov/programs-services/services-information/switrs-internet-statewide-integrated-traffic-records-system/switrs-2017-report)  Being generous with the aforementioned data, you're \\~2.6x as likely to die from a semi or a bus at the intersection of California and foothill (or crossing santa rosa to get to mustang village) than from this virus. \n\n[According to 2019 population data](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/04000US06-california/) there are \\~5.5m people in the 18-29 age bracket here in CA. That puts your odds at \\~1/20,000\n\nIf you don't want to go outside, that's on you. If you don't want to be around people who go outside, go home. If you're still worried about this, you're worried about the wrong thing. If you think you're making it out of this life alive, you'd be dead wrong, and I think of a lot of things people (especially poly students complaining on this thread) have a much higher fatality rate than .005%.

More cases will lead to a more restrictive tier which will hurt businesses. You can say all your stats about the low chances of dying which isn\u2019t wrong but it deviates from the point. We are still hurting people through the potential business closures that happen when the cases go up.",

A super-spreader event could still result in tens more deaths among former smokers, diabetics, and those in the 50-65 range who still haven't gotten vaccinated. Hell, even the elderly anti-vaxxers don't deserve to die because some CP idiots had a party.",

The majority of people who are at risk for covid are either dead or vaccinated. Sure yah there's people who are smoker and diabetic that are still unvaccinated that are at risk but the people who were at most risk at dying have been vaccinated. Of course the CDC said that you need to wait couple weeks for the protection to kick it so we can't go 100 to pre covid. There's also the new covid variants that can affect us too But it's time we start slowly opening up and get life to normal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the damages of COVID is mostly economic. Like you said sure maybe tens of deaths can occur and that's a reason on why we can't have large gatherings yet but the main reason is economic.  More cases will lead us to a more restrictive tier and its gonna hurt businesses that have already lost so much from this pandemic.",

    "postText": "I am currently a senior in highschool struggling to decide whether to commit to UCI or Cal Poly SLO!!\ud83d\ude2d I got admitted as undeclared (I wanted computer engineering) at UCI and for computer engineering at Cal Poly SLO. However, they both have their pros and cons and I\u2019m just stuck between these two schools. Here are my pros and cons please help!!\n\nPros for UCI:\n- Closer to home!\n- Better housing and meal plan (important)\n- It is a UC (people say it\u2019s prestigious??)\n- Better financial aid package (I can cover my tuition and fees + afford to get a double and highest meal plan so yay)\n- Way more diversity than Cal Poly\ud83d\ude2d\n- beautiful campus \n- can\u2019t think of more pros but im overall just worried about the education here vs cal polys \n\nCons for UCI:\n- I\u2019m undeclared so I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t be able to transfer to Computer Engineering \n- I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a commuter school so I\u2019m worried about social life\n- I\u2019ve heard profs aren\u2019t that great and mostly focus on their research than teaching (???)\n- competitive for internships, etc (worried I won\u2019t get a job)\n- grad school focused?? ( I just want to work I think)\n- cal poly graduates get paid more than uci graduates?\n\n\nPros for Cal Poly SLO:\n- college town!!! sooo beautiful \n- motto of learn by doing! ( which I\u2019ve heard prepares you for working meanwhile the UC\u2019s prepare for grad school)\n- smaller classrooms so 1 on 1 time with teachers and TAs\n- easier to get internships and jobs! ( I\u2019ve heard that by the 2nd year everyone starts to apply to internships so yayy)\n- got accepted for Computer Engineering!!! ( and I get a free laptop:) )\n-90% have a job after graduating!! And allegedly get paid more than uci graduates \n\nCons for Cal Poly SLO:\n- very little diversity (scary\ud83d\ude2d)\n- cramped dorms and the food isn\u2019t that good so yikes ( allegedly)\n- far from home (4 hour drive)\n- financial aid package is not good (i would have to l dorm with 3 people and get the 2nd meal plan)\n- overall very worried about money if i go here \n-",

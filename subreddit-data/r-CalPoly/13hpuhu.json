I am writing to inform you that I will not be returning as an active sister for the upcoming Fall quarter at CalPoly.\n\nDue to personal circumstances, I have had to make the difficult decision to take a break from my sorority involvement this year. I wanted to give you as much notice as possible so that you can make arrangements for the upcoming quarter.\n\nI also understand that there may be financial obligations involved with leaving the sorority, and I wanted to clarify that I am providing this notification in order to avoid any charges that may be incurred if I were to not provide adequate notice. I kindly ask that you inform me of any specific financial obligations or requirements that I need to be aware of, so that I can fulfill them as needed.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the experiences and opportunities that I have gained during my time as an active sister. It has been an honor to be a part of this community, and I hope to remain involved in the future as my circumstances allow.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or need any further information. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\\[Your Name\\]",

Although I haven't seen anyone say they've been accepted for computer engineering. Slo has always been my dream school for engineering.\n\nWhy can't they just do us a favor and let us know right away instead of waiting until after April? Cruel.\n\nIt's been a good run fellas.",

I regret not choosing a major where I had all of my required and desired courses completed and instead of reaching for civil. My cc literally had none of the desired courses available and I crammed a bunch of last minute courses at another CC :,)",

Cal Poly is legitimately cruel for making not only transfers but the freshmen wait for waitlists or rejections.\n\nShould I do more requirements over the next two semesters (and find a job or something to write about in ECs) or suck it up and give up? Taking more classes might tank my GPA since it is all I have, and CS is notorious for being hard to get into with low GPAs...",

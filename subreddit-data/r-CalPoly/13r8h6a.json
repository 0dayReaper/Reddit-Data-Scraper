    "postText": "So like I\u2019m currently terrified, shaking, nervous, puking (you get the gist). My graduation term is this Spring quarter and I am currently sitting with an F in a class. Does this mean I don\u2019t graduate on stage or at all? Like I understand I\u2019d have to retake the class but I\u2019m wondering to see if I can still graduate with my class, on stage this June 18. I already have graduation tickets and my gown/cap. Can I still graduate but take the class in the summer and then get my diploma later? Please help, I\u2019m so stressed this quarter!",

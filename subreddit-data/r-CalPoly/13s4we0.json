            "comment": "100% would go with BJ Yebisu. I had him for 326 and he's an awesome professor, probably my favorite from Cal Poly so far. I'm in 303 with Love and Olsen this quarter and the content is not very engaging and the class comes with a decent sized personal project and a comprehensive 40% final. Another factor is that you're forced to purchase a 300$ course for 303. In 326 you just work with your group throughout the quarter to develop a product concept and its much more enjoyable.\n\n Id say its pretty easy to get an A in 326 if you put in decent effort. Yebisu is also very willing to work with you on grades and allows you to negotiate multiple times throughout the quarter for a higher grade if you feel you deserve it. My entire group ended with an A and I think most people in the class did as well. Let me know if you have any more questions about either class.",

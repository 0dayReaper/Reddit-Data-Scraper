    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman considering living in the pride RLC. Can anyone speak to what that experience is like? How big of a group is it? How much community is there as a whole (not just with your roommates)? What are the chances I'll get in if I do request it?  If it stays in the same place next year (fourth floor of tsitkawayu), are the rooms mostly triples and quads like the rest of yakitutu or are there any doubles?",

The building as a whole is also one of the quieter yak dorms this year, tho sometimes rude ppl get into the building, but afaik that is the only time there is really damaged",

I\u2019m a current pride RA (graduating so I won\u2019t be your RA next year haha) and there is some discussion about expanding us to two floors for the next school year. Yak\u0294It\u02b8ut\u02b8u as a whole is almost exclusively triples and quads/quints. My floor has three doubles, the rest are larger. The vibes on this floor are absolutely amazing. The community has been very close and fun! If you choose to, it\u2019s very easy to hang out in the common areas and build community with everyone on the floor",

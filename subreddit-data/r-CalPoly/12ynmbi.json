    "postText": "Hi\nI just got into Cal Poly SLO for CS major. I'm currently an IB high school student and my boards are approaching. I wanted to know what minimum marks out of 45 would not affect my admission? And will they deny me if I get marks lower than my predicted score?",

            "comment": "It depends on your predicted score. I was predicted a 44 and my final was 39. I still got accepted into CS. Even though it was a big drop, 39 is still a good score so I guess they were fine with it. I also took the SATs (1390) and IELTS (8.5) which I don't think helped much tbh. \n\nWhat is your prediction and how much are you expecting to drop by?",

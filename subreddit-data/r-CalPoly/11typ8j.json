            "comment": "In my experience, unlike the quizzes and midterms they check less for syntax and more for concept. A few trivial questions here and there such as \u201cis python case sensitive\u201d, \u201cwhich of the following are mutable\u201d. Expect a good amount of \u201cwhat is displayed by the following code\u201d and \u201cwhich of the following code is correct\u201d type questions. So make sure you\u2019re not only know how to write code, but also read it. That\u2019ll be the first half of the test the other half will be three or four larger questions worth more points. I don\u2019t remember all the questions from when I took it but I vaguely remember having to multiply matrices together using nested for loops. I don\u2019t think there are any classes on the test. For the most part you should know for and while loops. How to start and call a function. How to manipulate lists and list of lists. And you should know all of the operations, division, multiplication, addition, etc..",

It will tend to be more theoretical though.\n\nCal Poly is a great school with a great engineering program. It will tend to be more hands on and practical. Biomedical is a very strong program at Poly and I have know quite a few people who have gone through the program and gone on to be very successful. SLO is a beautiful town in a beautiful area. (Much nicer than Davis in my opinion.",

The better question is what you enjoy. If you enjoy smaller classes and a smaller town vibe, Cal Poly is the way to go. If you enjoy larger classes, a larger school, and a larger community Davis is the way to go. Also, in regard to grad school, UCs are generally better for research and grad school while Cal Poly is more focused on churning out students to go into the industry.",

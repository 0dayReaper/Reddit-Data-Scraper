            "comment": "Take this from someone who took a lot of animal science classes.  And is an agriculture teacher that focuses on the animal science side of things. \n\nFirst off you only have two options if you\u2019re thinking of switching to that major; Cal Poly and Davis. \n\nIf you are thinking of becoming a vet a lot of people will recommend going to Davis since they have a great vet program. Your undergrad school does not matter when it comes to getting into their Vet Post grad program. In fact the number one major that gets into that grad program is history.  Also it is fairly well known that Cal Poly is planning on opening their own grad program for vets soon. \n\nRegardless of if you are planning on doing vet post grad or just animal science for another reason, Cal Poly is the obvious choice. Cal Poly with their hands on style makes you job ready from the day of graduation and the learning experiences is so much more impactful.   One of my favorite class memories was practicing AI on the campus cows for a quarter. You don\u2019t get that experience at Davis. \n\nI know I am biased, but I also have seen a ton of people go through both programs. Davis is amazing, SLO is better for animal science no question. \n\nAnother thing you have to take into account is the area. SLO and Davis are both small little college towns and both have their pros and cons. For me I much prefer living where it doesn\u2019t get to 110 regularly. SLO has my much preferred kind of environment. I love the coast, beaches, beautiful hiking spots, national forest super close.\n\nSo a big concern you have to take into account is what kind of climate do you want to live in. \n\nI am biased, I have a cal poly flag hanging in my classroom, I used to help recruit for cal poly, but I would 10/10 times choose cal poly over Davis regardless of major, but if you are thinking of doing animal science it\u2019s an absolute no brained in my perspective.  \n\nIf you aren\u2019t thinking of animal science I would still recommend SLO&gt;UCSD&gt;Davis and that\u2019s purely coming from the fact I love being on the coast",

            "comment": "UCSD and SLO could not be any more different. City of a million vs. city of 50,000. If you're looking for a small college town, it's either Davis or SLO. If you're looking for animal science, it's either Davis or SLO. Oldest Daughter is graduating from UCSD in June. Youngest daughter is starting SLO in September. I went to Davis. Davis is a small college town that is very liberal. SLO is a small college town that is fairly conservative. Davis is a very large campus. SLO is a pretty small campus. UCSD is a massive campus. All three tie for parking; there isn't any. UC holds the prestige for those outside of California. Those in California and human resource positions know the prestige of Poly. The question then becomes \"Who are you trying to impress more?\" La Jolla has the best weather, but you need to get accustomed to the sound of F18s and F35s. You're directly in the departure path for MCAS Miramar. SLO's weather can get warm but cools off at sunset. Davis's weather can get really hot, but cools off at night thanks to the Delta. UCSD has San Diego. Davis has Sacramento, SF, and Tahoe is only 100 miles away. Poly has SLO (and a great street fair!) You can look up the demographics of each campus if that matters to you. Being really familiar with all three: my choices would be #1 SLO, #2 UCSD, #3 Davis, but only you know with of these things matter most to you. The best news is you can't go wrong any of your choices. Best of luck and be proud of the fact you got into three awesome schools that many would die for.",

            "comment": "I'm an animal science major and I absolutely love it in slo. I don't know about the program at UCSD. I know Davis has a fantastic pre-vet program, but I don't know about their animal science major. At slo you get really fantastic hands-on experience with animals. I have taken a class on swine, equine, sheep and goat, and meat science and I am only a second year. All of those classes have labs with hands on experience working with animals. The major is not easy. Especially if you decide to go the pre-vet track, the major is academically rigorous. You will take general chem, organic chem, bio, biochem. If you are pre-vet you take extra chem classes and physics. Nutrition and anatomy classes are known to be brutal. But I truly believe I am getting a great education. My goal is vet school and SLO is definitely preparing me for it with challenging classes and hands-on experience. There are so many opportunities for jobs/internships and other hands on experiences for all students looking to go into all the different parts of the animal industry.\n\nFeel free to ask me questions if you have any!",

Poly is great because it is on the coast and has lots of outdoor activities as well as a great college downtown. Davis is closer to the mountains if you're into winter sports and also closer to metropolitan areas like Sacramento and the bay. I don't know a ton about ucsd but the campus is huge and you will probably feel a lot more like a drop in the bucket there (which could be a good or bad thing depending on your preferences)",

I think it comes down to the environment that you would prefer to be in. La Jolla is a beautiful area but it's a very affluent old money atmosphere and it's not a college town feel at all while slo gives you that. Also, which school are you closest to ? That is also important. For me, I live in the Bay Area and I got into the following three and went with slo because I vibed with the campus more than ucd and because I want to take my car with me, UCSD wasn't a convenient option for me. Hope this helps and good luck !",

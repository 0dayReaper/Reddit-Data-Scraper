On FAFSA form you choose if you live on campus or not, if you do Cal Poly is notified and probably that's how you get a housing grant if not then you don't. If you put living on campus on FAFSA form and you're not idk what happens but CP probably can crosslist it with students guaranteed to live on campus.",

Usually once you move off campus, you pay for everything yourself. I'm currently looking for a house as well and they're ranging from 4000-6000 dollars. However you can use any money that is deposited to your account that exceeds your tuition to pay for rent and other stuff.",

Before making any decisions I wanted to get in contact with someone who has been/is a grc major(hopefully in the ux concentration) because I have a couple of questions about the courses and major!! :)\n\nEDIT: hey guys thank yall so much for this advice, I think I'm going to attend cal poly and after private messaging a couple of you, I was able to come up with a perfect plan on what I'm going to do!! :)",

But you basically have to start in the engineering major and add on the secondary major outside of COE after a loooooooot of paperwork and finessing of the system. You basically would need to take tons of summer courses, and get a very high gpa. But I\u2019ve never heard of someone adding engineering as a secondary major. And given how impacted CSC is, I doubt they would entertain such a request. So for OP, if they want to double major, Cal Poly is probably not going to be able to fulfill that.",

Your priority improves as you complete your degree (i.e. seniors have better priority than juniors, juniors better than sophmores, and so on) I don't think GPA is a factor in priority unless you have a very low GPA (i.e. you get on academic probation) in which case your priority decreases. Students with disabilities have the highest priority registration always, I think. \n\n\nDon't be too discouraged though, if you find yourself unable to get into a particular CS class you need for the minor try talking with your advisor or the professor teaching the course to see if they can get you in anyways (sometimes they can make exceptions beyond normal class size limits). I'd also reccomend chatting with other CS majors/minors and seeing what their experience getting classes has been like.",

One thing about GRC classes it that you have about 1 hour of lecture and 3 hours of labs PER class and that is a hassle to plan your other classes around. I think minoring in CS is definitely possible as a couple students I know are doing it. The UX concentration classes are taught by the same professor and they are all structured the same way, where you learn absolutely nothing, but hey, at least it's easy right?",

GrC is super multidisciplinary which I really enjoy, you take lots of hands-on classes in all areas of designs such as print, web, and packaging. Though there are a few print heavy classes where you learn how to design specifically for print + the technology behind it (such as how to operate the machinery/equipment), I found them super helpful in strengthening my design skills and overall pretty fun (lots of cool projects!). \n\nThere\u2019s not a ton of UX/UI specific classes (even in the concentration), but I feel like there\u2019s enough for the basics and it\u2019s definitely the best major here if you really wanna do UX/UI. There\u2019s also some on campus organizations you can join to get more experience such as Iter8, which was started up by GrC students. They work on UX/UI projects each quarter, which is a great way to get hands-on experiences and nice portfolio experiences.\n\nLmk if you have any other questions!",

Could I message you privately because I have a lot of questions about your experiences in grc and the other options/pathways I can take within the boundaries of this major :)",

I am a senior and I have been able to experience such a variety of skills and have learned super relevant life skills as well like file management (which some people are terrible at). GrC is so unique and such a great tight knit community. Something to consider as well is there are two UXUI clubs (and hopefully growing) because it is still only a few years old as a concentration. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend getting involved with Iter8 because they work with other clubs, businesses, student projects, and industry connections. It\u2019s a new club but they are really cool and doing a lot of fun UXUI projects. UX Fest is the other club that I would recommend.",

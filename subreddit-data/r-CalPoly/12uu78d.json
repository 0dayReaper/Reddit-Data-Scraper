    "postText": "Hi everyone, so I'm in Professor Keese's Geography of Latin America class right now and we have an assignment where we need to interview someone and write a paper about the interview.\n\nThe requirements we have to follow are that the interviewee has to be from a Latin American country (Caribbean included) and immigrated to the United States as an adult/young adult/teenager. Unfortunately, all the people I know in my life who fit within these requirements have passed away and I do not know anyone else. I was hoping that someone here who fit the requirments might be willing to be interviewed?\n\nI can provide the questions in advance, and you don't have to answer anything you don't want to from among the list.\n\nI don't think I'm allowed to pay you but if you'd like, choose a restaurant where we can have the interview and I'll pay for your meal (idk firestone, woodstocks, petra, etc).",

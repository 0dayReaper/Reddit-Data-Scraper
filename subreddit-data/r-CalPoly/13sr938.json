    "postText": "(sorry for the repost, but the first one did not include the video)\n\nLooking for one male to sublet my room during July 15 - December 31.\n\nThe property is a 3 story town house located off of Orcutt and Broad Street. It includes 4 bedrooms (+1 guest room) x 3 bath with good views, a large kitchen, garage, and living room. See video for entire layout. The large rooms on the 3rd floor are going to be split in half once construction is done, they are plenty big still.\n\nSubletting here means you get to enjoy the benefits of being the first tenants in a beautiful brand new property. Another is that the landlord Zac is really cool, he's stoked to have Cal Poly students living at his properties. And we are right next door to a brand new Nautical Bean Coffee Shop, which is a great place to get work done.\n\nRent will be $1,200 a month + utilities. Wifi is included and so are appliance (fridge, oven, microwave, washer, and dryer).\n\nPlease reach out with any questions! If I don't respond quickly on facebook messenger, feel free to reach me at [cbcavall@calpoly.edu](mailto:cbcavall@calpoly.edu). I will provide video of the entire property upon request!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ynth0nesa2b1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=814c180f5146f93dcbb88cf49e6218f2606ee0db\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/13sr938/video/2ca4eiq6sa2b1/player",

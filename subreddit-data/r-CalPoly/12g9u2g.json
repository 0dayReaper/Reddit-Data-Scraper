            "comment": "\u2026 I would say Cal Poly is more of a beige. Not like retirement home beige. Maybe more like 90s suit beige. But not the ugly kind of beige. The beige that perfectly extenuates an outfit.\nReal talk: Everyone on this page is going to have a positive bias towards Cal Poly. It\u2019s going to depend on what major you are. I am an Ambassador for the CEng, so I give tours to prospective students. Feel free to ask more specific questions, but here are some highlights. \nWe have the only 1000 level clean room west of the Mississippi accessible to students  (Class that comes to mind is MATE 430). \nOur wind tunnel has been used by Tesla, Apple, and Amazon to test products. We are also in the process of installing a hypersonic wind tunnel (I don\u2019t have a completion date \ud83d\ude10).\nI believe we are only 1 of 2 schools west of the Mississippi to have machine shops available to every student on the campus once they get their training (Those 2 shops are Mustang \u201860 and the Aero Hanger) \nIve never heard anything about UofA engineering, so I can\u2019t compare, but industry loves to hire Cal Poly grads.",

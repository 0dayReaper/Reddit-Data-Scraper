            "comment": "I would say theft is definitely a concern if you have a nice (or nice looking) bike. If you do not want to keep your bike on a rack or in your dorm room while not at class you can get a bike locker. They have them in a few spots around campus and are pretty inexpensive. \n\nThe majority of bike thefts I know about had cheap cable locks so at minimum get a U lock, if not something beefier. I've heard of people getting nice bikes stolen from U locks while locked up outside overnight.",

            "comment": "Just be smart about locking your bike. Use an actual U lock as your primary locking device, that should always lock at LEAST your frame to the rack. I have a u lock that let\u2019s me lock my frame and front wheel to the rack. If you\u2019re going to be leaving your bike overnight, use a u lock for the frame (and wheel if possible) and then a cable for the other wheel(s)\n\nFor your seat, if you have a quick adjust type clamp, switch it out. Same with your wheels, locking skewers are pretty cheap",

On top of that, I have quick releases on my front and back wheels, so I bought locks for my seat post and both wheels to prevent them from being stolen. It stays in a bike locker over night because I live on campus. If you are worried about your bike, $25/ quarter for a bike locker is not that bad of a deal. I\u2019m off-campus next year and I plan on trying to get a bike locker again next year.",

I  have heard from multiple people that they only care about your cal poly  GPA and coursework.\n\nI got admitted  for a major that I don't think I will enjoy and would like to switch,  but I am unsure if they will start the process with me if they check my  high school GPA and application.  \n\n\nI would like to switch from College of Liberal Arts to Business.",

            "comment": "As far as what Cal Poly says officially, it depends on whether you're switching majors within your current college or not. My major changes were from one CENG major to another, so they just looked at my classes and Cal Poly GPA.\n\nFrom what I've heard, they do the initial application check when you switch colleges.\n\nWould recommend talking to an academic advisor/going to a change of major workshop once you're on campus, they'll be able to answer more definitively.",

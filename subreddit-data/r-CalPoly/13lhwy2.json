I\u2019m an incoming transfer that\u2019s also interested in sport management and I chose my major to be RPTA so I can have my concentration on sport management, if you\u2019re really passionate about it you could probably change into the major and then do a business minor",

IDK if they still do it, but accounting club would have special \"visit-the-firms\" trips where 20 or 30 kids could tour the offices of the big accounting firms in San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles. \n\nI signed up and went. It was awesome and really helped illuminate my decisions.\n\nThat said, if they don't do them anymore, try to make one happen for yourself. Reach out to people and ask if you can tour their offices and ask questions.",

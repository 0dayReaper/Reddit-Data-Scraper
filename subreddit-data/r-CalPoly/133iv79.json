    "postText": "I need to decide by tomorrow, May 1st, on a school to spend the next four years of my life. I\u2019m passionate about and planning on majoring in ES (environmental studies BS at ucsb and environmental management &amp; protection at slo). I understand sb has a much better program for my major, but the campus did not appeal to me as much as the campus and area surrounding slo. Less of a party type of guy (still like to attend, just not every weekend) and more into outdoor activities (mostly hiking and surfing). The greater presence of trees and greenery around slo is a major plus, as is the closer hiking, but further beach is a negative. I\u2019m nervous that if I choose sb I won\u2019t get the support I need from the staff while slo apparently is extremely supportive. However I don\u2019t want any overbearing support/hand holding or the less competitive atmosphere slo has\u2014I learn better in a more competitive environment. I know I would be satisfied and dissatisfied at either, just in different ways [surfing vs hiking, good program vs meh program, oil smell vs cow smell, unsupportive vs supportive, higher living cost vs lower living cost, more competitive vs less competitive, etc.] Sb seems to offer me a better education while slo offers a better environment to live and learn. However, I believe that some of these differences are too general and not enough for me to make a decision. Considering this information and any outside knowledge you can bring, I ask of you to please help me decide.",

The UCs ride a lot on their research reputation and giving you \u201can education\u201d, while State schools are focused on career preparation. \u201cLearn by Doing\u201d. UCs can be very impersonal depending on the major. Another issue at UCSB is upper class an housing. I belong to private Isla Vista (IV) group and finding housing for their children attending UCSB and SBCC is very challenging. You\u2019ll receive a quality education at either school but let the campus and surrounding area speak to you. I had a blast at UCSB but that was a long time ago.",

They offer the help that you will want; you can seek more help if you think you need it but I feel like they offer the perfect amount. But seriously, you\u2019re going to want all the help you can get. I agree that it isn\u2019t super competitive, but you can always compete against yourself. Quarters go by quick and you get abt three exams in 10 weeks for each class so it\u2019s pretty easy to want to always do better than your previous score (that\u2019s how I do it at least :)) To add, It seems like you like the atmosphere of slo quite a lot and that is the most important thing when it comes to choosing a college.",

            "comment": "As someone who is going to Slo, but has friends at ucsb, and visits them regularly, I think ucsb has a better social life by far. Isla vista is literally a peninsula full of your peers. Even if you aren\u2019t into parties, ucsb wins. If you care more about social life than school, please go to ucsb. Trust me.\n\nHowever, academically, I prefer Slo. The uc\u2019s, being research schools, are usually 100+ person classes, where you don\u2019t even have the chance to interact with your professors. At poly, the biggest class I know of is 70 people, and the vast majority are around 30 people. Professors have office hours where you can personally ask them questions, not just a TA. Also, poly hires professors that have experience within their industry, and haven\u2019t been writing research papers for tens of years. Ucsb will probably be more academically rigorous, but not for good reasons. You will more than likely come out of poly in a better position, if you are planning on going into the workforce. If you want to go into higher learning, ucsb might be the way to go.\n\nWhen it comes to activities, don\u2019t expect to do much surfing your first year at poly, unless you get to know someone who has a car and is willing to drive to the beach. Public transport isn\u2019t much of an option. Hiking on the other hand, is right out the proverbial back door. I\u2019d say slo has better hiking, and ucsb has better surfing.\n\nGood luck with your decision, and I\u2019m sure no matter which you pick, you\u2019ll find a place amongst your freshman class and be happy.",

    "postText": "Is anyone in or has been in the college corps?  \nWas it worth it to you? \n\n  \nFor most, at least STEM/ENGR majors, the work is not related to their majors. But let's be honest the incentive is the $7000 paid out over 10 months and then another $3000 upon completing 450 hours. If you want to add those and do an hourly pay basis, its basically a $22.22/hr job.\n\nI saw some posts from a few months ago claiming that they lost money on their FAFSA due to this as it was considered taxable income, and how it was a bad decision because it reduced their financial aid by $6000. However any job paying at $22.22 will definitely reduce you financial aid (at least where im from that's good pay for a student job).....  \n\n\nMaybe I'm not seeing it for what it really is, any thoughts?",

I would say it has been worth it to me, but a lot of it depends on the organization that you get assigned to do work for-some are better than others (I recommend the K-12 education or food insecurity ones based on what I have heard). Some of my work is related tangentially to my major, but many other people I\u2019ve talked to have said that they have learned a lot even when it isn\u2019t related to theirs. \n\nIf you want the 3k at the end you should be averaging around 15/hours a week for the entire school year, which is no joke. The $700/month is legit (and tax free since it is a stipend). If you hit 450 hours, you get the $3k, but it is broken up between a normal, ~$1200 check, and a ~$1800 award stipend that can only be used on stuff like student loans or tuition. Tbh, I am not sure how it is affecting FAFSA yet. I don\u2019t think it should but I do not know for sure. I hope this helps!",

            "comment": "Last year Cal Poly and Boulder (direct admit into CS with chancellor scholarship) were my top 2 choices.  Lots of engineering support at Boulder like Cal Poly but really couldn\u2019t take any CS classes except for an intro CS class as a 1st year. Compared to being able to start with CS 202 at Cal Poly 1st quarter due to AP credit.  Was also worried since Boulder pretty much accepts everyone outside of their selective engineering program it would be frustrating watching others not take their classes seriously while enduring the engineering grind.  At Cal Poly all majors take their classes seriously and don\u2019t skip class and actually study due to the rigor and fast pace of the quarter system.  Also, felt Cal Poly CS/SE majors had easier access and more internship and job opportunities than Boulder.  Cal Poly is the last CSU to convert to semester so will be a smoother transition since they will know best practices.",

            "comment": "cal poly easily has the best program of the three (not that those schools suck). coming from the bay, a big change in diversity for sure (although even that can vary depending on where you're from). it's really really hard to get cs classes at cal poly, so come in prepared to take summer classes to make it up (either at cp or at a cc) and/or take longer than four years to finish your degree. a lot of good networking opportunities (apple used to exclusively hire cal poly and ucb grads). \n\n**HOWEVER,** unless you graduate in three years, you will experience the cal poly transition from quarter to semester (at the behest of the csu system and not the school's free will) which will make things odd. also the library is about to start renovation so it will be out of commission for a couple years (with delays likely).",

There are lots of other study spaces on campus though, so I wouldn't worry about it too much unless you absolutely need to see books around you to study lol",

It shows you stuck with it and graduated, no matter the time frame. Trust me I know it can suck to see others go on before you, but just know everyone has a different time frame/trajectory and you\u2019ll be just fine! Best of luck to you!",

Graduating in 5-6 years within CENG is very common considering Cal Poly\u2019s rigor. \n\nPersonally I think delaying graduation for a year is well worth the benefits, especially at Cal Poly: less stress, the luxury of being able to take courses outside your curriculum that interests you now that you have more time, and one extra summer for internship.\n\nGood luck!",

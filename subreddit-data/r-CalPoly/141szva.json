    "postText": "I'm planning on taking some online asynchronous summer courses from SBCC (Santa Barbara City Community College) and don't know much work they'll require. Anyone got experience with online asynchronous courses offered by SBCC.\n\nAlso btw, I'm planning on taking just some regular GEs like B1 and C2 so maybe Spanish I or II and then a geography or general chem class from my B1.\n\nI appreciate any info, even if it's not specific to SBCC. Maybe even Foothill College or Cuesta or whatever community college you've done before for online async classes. Thanks!",

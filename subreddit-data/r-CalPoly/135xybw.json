Even if you don't have any experience (either with the portal or in-person), we'd still like you to participate. There are some screenshots in the survey, or you can check your own portal to get an opinion on the usability/ease of navigation. We appreciate your participation!\n\nFeel free to leave any feedback so we can improve the follow-up survey that will be posted later.",

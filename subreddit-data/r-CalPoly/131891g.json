    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI\u2019ve accepted my offer for class of 2027 (landscape architecture) and am super excited to go to SLO, but am worried I might be at risk of getting rescinded. In every other year (including fall semester) I\u2019ve been almost all A\u2019s with one or 2 B\u2019s, but currently have a C- and 2 B\u2019s for this semester. I saw the website page and was still a little confused on if I meet the requirements or not.",

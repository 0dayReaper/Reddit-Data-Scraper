If you have too many dining dollars, try shopping at the PCV convenience store or Campus Market because they have more stuff that isn't food like collanders and sometimes cups or T-shirts that make good gifts for family. Anyone not getting a dining plan next year should be checking how much they have now compared to how much they used in other quarters and start spending the excess (/saving if they're short) because in May and June the shops that take dining dollars start getting regularly cleaned out from everyone having the same idea.",

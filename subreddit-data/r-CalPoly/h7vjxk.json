All the lights were off in all the buildings. It was so quiet. Eerie and lonely. Kinda sad.\n\nAt the top of the hour, the bell in the education belltower sounded. Immediate smile. Love that sound. And then a few other grads in their caps and gowns showed up. It was so nice to see other human beings. \n\nWe tried to have a socially distant conversation and the train went by blasting its horn as loud as could be. We could not hear each other at all. lol Such a California Blvd moment.",

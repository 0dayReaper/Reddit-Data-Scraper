I\u2019m applying to as many scholarships as I can but then I realize I would need to move and live inside a dorm. Should I go to cal poly slo or go to a community college, reapply, and hopefully get accepted again.",

            "comment": "It really depends.\n\nIf you weren't accepted for Engineering or Architecture the value of a Cal Poly degree is not going to provide enough value to justify the costs relative to other lower cost options.\n\nIf you were accepted for Engineering or Architecture and are from out of state: Your costs are going to be much higher. If your aspirational career is not averaging in the six figures at the entry level it likely won't be worth the cost, but this is debatable especially if scholarships come into play.\n\nIf you are in state and were accepted for Engineering or Architecture: The value of your Cal Poly degree is likely worth what it will cost relative to going the community college route. Your odds of being accepted as a transfer are incredibly low and if you have an admission in hand now it is best to take it.",

            "comment": "I am a current community college student transferring to Cal Poly for aerospace engineering this fall. I can speak on my experience of this route. I am at a local CC that accounts for 40% of all Cal Poly transfer students. Our general rule of thumb is that if you complete the required courses it is a very very very high likely hood of being accepted to SLO. This is because we are so close to Cal Poly and the main \"feeder\" college so our course work is designed to transfer over nicely with SLO. In the last two years at my CC, Allan Hancock, I personally do not know of any student who completed all the requirements for their major and were not accepted as a transfer to Poly, from my community college.\n\nAs far as finances, I have been working part time since high school, and full time in the summers. At a California community college the BOG will most likely cover all your tuition ( depends on family finances). I have completed all my General Ed and the beginning of my engineering course work completely for free, as far as tuition costs are concerned. In fact most community college students actually receive financial aid and are almost getting paid to go to community college, if you look at it this way. I am in the reverse-goldilocks area of financial aid where I do not qualify for aid and my parents nor myself were able to pay for a 4 year straight out of high school.\n\nBack to my experience, I have not paid for a single community college class and have been able to save enough money in this time, where I will most likely not have to borrow any money and will be able to finish my bachelors with zero student debt.\n\nI recommend if you have a community college that is in close proximity to Cal Poly (ex: Allan Hancock or Cuesta) and you are concerned of financials you should do community college, keep in mind it is never guaranteed you will be accepted again. On the other hand if you are willing take some student loans to have the college and this is important to you, go straight to the university.",

My counselors in hs always told me community college was a much harder route and even if it costs money, SLO is on the cheaper end in comparison to UCs and private schools while still being close to their levels (if not better for finding a job.)\n\nYou need to weigh your options and if you really can't take that debt and if you believe in your ability to do well in community college to get accepted again. Talk to your counselors and family, or if possible maybe some transfers here.",

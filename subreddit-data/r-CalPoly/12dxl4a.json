    "postText": "It\u2019s no secret mental health services, Title IX, and DEI get little done. There are so many complaints about their effective lack of action that I can\u2019t but feel it\u2019s intentional. Just like how a corporate HR isn\u2019t there for the workers, it\u2019s there so the company can\u2019t get sued if something happens. \n\nHell, I worked for the CSDs and OSSR my second year and lot of disciplinary stuff was built on just checking boxes to reduce liability. Just having the students come in to tell their side of the story when it pragmatically has little effect on what actual disciplinary action is taken. \n\nAnyways rant over just felt the incoming freshmen should be aware of this.",

You haven\u2019t given us any evidence. You presented an opinion as factual and then climbed a hill. Haha! Nobody can prove me wrong if I can\u2019t hear what they\u2019re saying!\n\nEvaluate arguments based on merits and evidence, not by whether others agree or disagree.\n\nI disagree with you, I think mental health services are useful in keeping many students afloat. Ask someone who receives mental health support from the school if mental health support is important.\n\nWhen you say that the school does not care about them, you discredit the educated, qualified, and committed staff who run the program. Cal Poly is not one big mean capitalist company. It has that aspect in addition to a lot of people who care about student success. Your opinion of the school is very black and white.",

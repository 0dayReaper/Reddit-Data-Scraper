            "comment": "There is a process and it is not easy but I know a student that got in for theater and switched to aerospace engineering! The student has to be razor sharp on what they want- take those classes and drop theater classes they are automatically put into their first year, write essays and get VERY high grades ( higher than those already in the major) in those new major classes to prove they belong in the new major. Again not impossible at all but not an easy switch either. You have to prove you can handle the rigors of the new major . IF you can prove that Cal Poly will let you switch.",

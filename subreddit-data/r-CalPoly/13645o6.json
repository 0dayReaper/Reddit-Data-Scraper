    "postText": "I'm currently in an ICMA (Calpoly change of major process) and still figuring out what I want to major in. My current ICMA is for Biology, but I'm also interested in Biochemistry. Is there anyone currently (or used to be) majoring in Biochem that could give me some insight into the major? From my understanding it's quite hard (P-chem, Calc 1-3, Phys 1-3, etc) but the pay is higher in comparison to regular Biology and it may be better for postgrad. I'm interested in physiology, pharmacology, and organic chemistry. Any thoughts?",

            "comment": "if you're interested in orgo and pharmacology, I'd definitely try to get the ICMA to biochem instead. \n\nI came in as a marine science major, and switched to chemistry my second quarter. my main reason was that I disliked the macro study of biology, and would rather get a hard science degree (as opposed to soft). \n\nIf you have more of an interest for chem than bio, then biochem is the way to go. The curriculum has plenty of free electives for excess courses like physiology and stuff, but also has a pretty heavy chem focus.

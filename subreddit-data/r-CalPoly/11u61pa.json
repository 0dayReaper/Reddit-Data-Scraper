Historically, posting the vacancy on Handshake (Mustang Jobs) would consistently lead to a very robust pool of qualified candidates.  \n\nIn the past five years or so I've had an increasing level difficulty finding good candidates. Clearly I need to change my recruiting strategy and would welcome any ideas or feedback. Thank you!",

Oftentimes they'll know students or know of people and will recommend them.",

As a student, I would prioritize those jobs because I was typically competing against a smaller applicant pool for that position. Personal referrals were especially valuable, from a student perspective.\n\nI recommend looking through the course catalog and reaching out to professors if their course and its pre-requisite courses align with the job qualifications. They may refer you to students they believe would be a good fit, or they may just share position posting with the whole class section. \n\nJust be aware that professors are crazy busy around midterms and finals. Some may also follow a personal policy to not connect recruiters/companies they don't personally know with students.",

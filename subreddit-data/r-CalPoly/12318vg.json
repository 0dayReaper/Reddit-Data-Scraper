            "comment": "I was in the exact position you were 2 years ago! I was almost 100% committed to UCI, but something about Cal Polys program made me feel like I would regret not taking the offer. My best friend went to UCI for CPE, so I can tell you a little about what I know from him/doing research.\n\nCal Polys CPE degree has changed a lot in the past two years. Like a commenter said, your first year is essentially as a CS major. However, you start to deviate a lot after that. Previously, you were meant to then do the EE series (Circuits 1-3 + Semiconductors + Digital Electronics) your sophomore and part of your junior year. CPE was originally a joint major without a department, so it was much more like the CS/EE degree at UCI. However, when CPE became its own department (happened my freshmen year), they began rolling out more new classes specific to the major. \n\nThe main thing that changed is the EE series. Instead of 5 classes, you now take 3. If you wanted to do hardware, you might initially see this as a disadvantage. Here\u2019s my perspective:\nThe EE circuits/electronics series contains a lot of stuff useful only to EE majors. The new series is meant to rectify this by only teaching CPEs the hardware knowledge that applies to their field. This also massively opens up tech electives. \n\nYour upper division classes will be a mix of CS and CPE classes. The CS classes are operating systems and networks (lower level software). The CPE classes are microcontrollers, computer architecture, and a CPE-specific signals class.\n\nMost of your upper div classes will be tech electives. This is nice since you can cater the major to your interests. Interested in hardware? - take the EE/CPE classes on hardware. Wanna be a CS major but have the hardware background? - you can easily trace your way through the CS upper division classes. There\u2019s also a great middle path in robotics, embedded, and computer vision.\n\nUCIs CPE degree is a custom path with its own classes. You go through the same classes and concepts as cal polys degree, but they are all catered to CPE majors. This means that if you change your mind and want to be a CS or EE major, you can\u2019t without tracing back through those curriculums. Cal polys CPE classes often give credit for a set of classes if one decides to change majors, so less backtracking is involved. However, this means that most if not all of UCIs degree caters to core-CPE careers. It means that less has to be pieced together yourself (you\u2019ll come out with a coherent degree). If you aren\u2019t sure what you want to do though, this could be a major disadvantage. \n\nHonestly, program-wise, I made the right decision for me. I got exposure to EE and CS that I needed to decide my area of interest. Cal Poly is also just a better set up institution for undergrad engineering because of the large number of applied labs and smaller class sizes. If you have social/school culture questions, I\u2019d refer to literally anyone else. I have very little constructive to say (unless you want negatives). That being said, I don\u2019t regret my decision to go to cal poly.",

            "comment": "It depends on how you want to specialize as a computer person. Some people prefer to work on client applications (software engineering), some people prefer to be a jack of all trades (computer science), and some people prefer to focus on low level programming like embedded systems and chip design (computer engineering). As a computer engineer you can still choose to take classes that will teach you all manner of things in software but you will take more electrical engineering courses, low-level computing courses, and some more physics/math. I started out as a CPE but switched to CS because I wanted to focus more on the software side of things. Switching between them is really easy as the first year of courses is pretty much the same. \n\nAs for internship/job opportunities, it really is all about specialization. Often times jobs will be looking for a specific skillset: machine learning, chip design, web development, etc. I made the mistake of taking really general CS electives when the best way to get internships is to take the niche classes nobody likes to take. Databases, networking, data science, etc.\n\nGood luck!",

Think I'll be able to give better insight next year since that's when you're given pseudo EE courses.\n\nI've heard it is more on the software side, just lower level (ie systems programming with assembly) rather than to the extent of EE. Hopefully some alumni or seniors could chime in for a decent idea of the major",

My sibling expressed jealousy over the hands on / learn by doing ethos at Cal Poly compared to the more theoretical / academic ethos at UCI and they also didn\u2019t like how competitive some of the classmates were at UCI compared to my experience at Cal Poly (99% of my classmates were very chill). I think you can\u2019t go wrong either way though. What tipped the scale for me was the fact that I grew up next to UCI and wanted to go away for school and I already had many friends up in SLO.",

            "comment": "Keep in mind 306 is proof based, so I would say it takes everything you knew in 206 and just builds on it with proofs. Things like proving something is a subspace, a linear operator, proving so and so is linearly independent or dependent, just some basic stuff mentioned but I felt like if your foundation of 248 was not good, your proofs can fall apart and you might suck at combining it with 206. If you were solid about 206 and 248 was OK, I think it won\u2019t be too bad.",

            "comment": "306 is the real entryway into the math major. 248 exposes you to proofs and how they work, 306 is where you start using that stuff to do math. In theory, you don't really need to know 206 at all. The book that usually gets used doesn't really do any matrix theory at all, and ask the stuff with change of basis and linear transformations  is really abstract.\n\nA student that's cool with proofs but has weaker linear knowledge is going to be in way better shape than someone fresh off of 206 and with a weak background in proof based reasoning.",

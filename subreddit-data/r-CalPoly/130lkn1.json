    "postText": "Hello, I am a computer science major developing a social app for my senior project. The app allows for users to enter proximity voice chat with other random users within their range. It is essentially a walkie-talkie app. We have a great user interface and plan on deploying a website and mobile apps this summer. I think this would work great as an Omegle competitor and was looking to see if anybody might want to collaborate with me on the business/marketing side of things.",

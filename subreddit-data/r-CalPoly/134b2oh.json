    "postText": "Hey guys! I\u2019m an incoming transfer student and need some help deciding between cal poly  slo and ucsd. I got into CS for cal poly slo and applied math - CS for ucsd and would love any and all input and advice you guys have! I actually already submitted my SIR for SLO but it was to secure housing. Admissions told me i could withdraw anytime before june :)\n\nCal poly slo\nPros: \n- Closer to home\n- smaller class sizes\n- learn by doing\n- imo i feel like there\u2019s more internship opportunities here\n- i love the social life\nCons: \n- after fin aid, my tuition is double what it is for ucsd\n- if i were to work part time, there\u2019s not a lot of jobs available \n- doesn\u2019t have a business minor i want\n- not that diverse for minorities\n\nucsd \nPros:\n- beautiful campus\n- cheaper to attend than cal poly (after fin aid)\n- has many minor options that interest me\n- more prestige ig\nCons:\n- socially dead\n- competing against a lot more ppl for internship opportunities\n- easier to switch majors(?)\n- higher cost of living\n\nPS: I want to switch my major @ ucsd for either Data science or CS if i could and hopefully still minor in business",

            "comment": "For CS the most important thing besides your actual degree are internships. If you want to get an internship early on, which you should aim for, you need to do a lot of independent projects and dsa practice which you can do at any school. A lot of people mention that getting internships will be easier at Cal Poly which might have been true before covid but now not many companies come (for CS specifically) and when they do they don't want first years unless you have a killer resume which i explained earlier how to get. The main way you are going to get internships is applying online which is a free for all (u competing with everyone). \n\nI think in the long run you will benefit from ucsd as the prestige will hold long term and getting an internship in todays post covid everyone in cs age is all about personal projects and having that dawg in you which doesn't depend on the school you go to.\n\nYou mentioned cost and tbh if cp is double ucsd then i thinks its an obv choice to go to ucsd. In the end, everything depends how you make the most of the opportunities you have. gl",

You get to decide what kind of college experience you have and how much you get out of it. But I understand stress and agonizing. Hope it all worked out!",

It immediately gave me a close community of friends, a fun (and physical) hobby / time commitment, and gave me access to leadership opportunities. Your experience may vary, but it's been my favorite thing about attending Cal Poly, and I highly recommend it.",

Just take it seriously and show that you have some level of proficiency in your instrument + that you want to learn and that you want to be in the band. For some sections (mainly drumline, like snares/tenors/etc.) auditions can be more competitive, but I don't think that those are representative of the majority of the band.",

If you like tenors, audition with them! You can also audition for multiple instruments as far as I know. As long as you're passionate and want to learn, you're gonna succeed.",

You have one year to finish the remaining projects for the class and the prof will then give you a grade.  Ifyou don\u2019t complete things within a year,the incomplete will become an F.  Reach out to the prof to discuss what\u2019s necessary to finish. It\u2019s better than having to completely retake the class, which is what a W would do for you.",

Of course, you can go to office hours, but I don\u2019t think that replaces a lecture and the collaboration of being in class. If it\u2019s an online course to begin with, then completing the work will be much easier. If it\u2019s not meant to be an online class, you might struggle like I did. But if you\u2019re super organized and have your hair super together, then go for it.",

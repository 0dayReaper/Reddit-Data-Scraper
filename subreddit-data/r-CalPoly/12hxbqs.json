After doing CCE WOW I met so many amazing people who made me feel welcome here at Cal Poly. It definitely helps you adjust to the PWI as a minority here and I highly recommend it.",

            "comment": "CCE will have POC as that\u2019s what it\u2019s geared towards. Couple things to note with that fact are that depending on your own circumstance There is a good chance you\u2019ll be around people with similar majors, dorm/floor, or interests. So you could potentially make some friends as many people do in WoW. I for one had 10 people in my WoW group from my building. Couple being from my floor. As for comparing it with the regular WoW, basically you\u2019ll be doing stuff related to POC more often than. For example, on our camp fire trip we had s\u2019mores and stuff but we also had an activity in which we would rotate and talk about troubles POC go through in college. I don\u2019t know if the regular did something like this but that\u2019s an example of what i did (current freshman).",

I ended up vouching out of most of the events like paint ball because I felt like I didn\u2019t belong. I guess it\u2019s a wash on how sociable you are and how accepting your group is.",

As much as this all sounds great I\u2019m curious to hear how firsthand experiences differ from students who choose CCE vs not. I met a lot of people from all walks of life during WOW and throughout my time here and I didn\u2019t choose any particular programming. \n\nI would never want students to feel uncomfortable regardless of their background, but I\u2019ve always felt that forced diversity is just as bad as a lack of diversity. Perhaps allowing students to choose to be in a group of only POC is part of the problem to begin with? Wouldn\u2019t this be voluntary segregation? If I am part of a minority, I wouldn\u2019t like to live my life pretending I\u2019m not for the sake of \u201ccomfort.\u201d This is how racism is fostered, not inclusivity.",

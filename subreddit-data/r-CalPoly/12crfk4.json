    "postText": "I know that a lot of first-year science majors with hefty workloads are considering dropping their major or college altogether around this time of the year, and if that's you, I want you to read this first.\n\nI started Cal Poly as a biology major, and I SUCKED. I was on Academic Probation my first quarter, had to retake multiple classes, and just could not handle Intro Bio, Gen Chem, or Calculus. Not only that, but the intro bio series (150, 161, 162) was making me HATE biology. I was getting the low score (29% ,33%, etc.) on exams. I didn't think that I'd make it through my first year of college. \n\nLater I realized that's the point of introductory classes. Yes, they are very informative and I will admit that I rely on the foundation they provided me a lot, but they are designed to make the majority of people drop. Unfortunately, this directly targets low-income students and marginalized groups, as they often have not had a great high school education, which is how most students have the background knowledge to succeed in these courses. On top of that, a lot of low-income students cannot afford to fail and are forced out of their majors. But when you get to upper-division, almost everyone is on the same playing field.\n\nI didn't drop my major, and I continued to fail, But by winter of my second year, I had all As and Bs. It gets better. On top of that, I'm still on track to graduate in 4 years. The stupid thing about bio is that they make you take a ridiculous amount of courses your first year, and then have basically nothing on your flow chart after that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; sometimes intro classes are not a great representation of what's to come in your major, it's okay to fail your first year, and the only real way to fail is to drop out of the major you once loved. If you know for a fact that you absolutely hate your major and love something else, then go for it. But don't drop because it's too hard. You are not stupid and will succeed as long as you continue to work hard. I believe in you.",

            "comment": "In my opinion bio at our school is cucked because they don\u2019t really prepare for the trending job market at all. Biology is becoming increasingly quantitative in nature yet in my opinion there isn\u2019t nearly enough statistics, math, or programming. Literally I was one the only one in my class who could do any meaningful programming. \n\n\nI mean it makes sense because a lot of biology majors chose the majors cuz they hate math and stats but I don\u2019t think it serves them justice considering how the future of biology is turning out to be.",

However, to give a slightly different perspective (I'm a gen chem LA), the chemistry department had to let students into their gen chem classes without them having a math course as a requirement because an increasingly larger number of students are matriculating without having taken the SAT/ACT, and neither did they get enough exposure to mathematics classes in high school (and as OP mentioned, a big reason could be that they come from high schools without the resources to adequately prepare their students/they come from low-income backgrounds). Thus, the chem departments had to drop a lot of math-based topics from their curriculum to adapt to the students. I do agree that there should be more classes that are quantitative in nature, but that would require these classes to adapt to the incoming students. Which it seems like Cal Poly is reluctant to do because as mentioned, the point of these intro classes is to weed out students who cannot keep up. (Although, this could change given that we're switching to the semester system soon?)",

If it was truly meant to weed out students the professors wouldn\u2019t be nearly as helpful and the courses would be much harder yet this isn\u2019t the case. \n\n\n\nI think calpoly should definitely update their curriculum. Put in requirements like csc 101 especially since biology nowadays is highly computational. A separate problem is that the csc department is impacted af too but that\u2019s a separate issues. There\u2019s too many broad biological courses in my opinion that could definitely be replaced.",

Yes, students can reach out to helpful professors, but the different between a student who had AP chemistry available to them in high school compared to a student starting chemistry at Cal Poly is so vast. The majority of students who drop their STEM majors in their first year are from marginalized backgrounds. A potential solution to this is having summer supplemental classes before attending college to get on par with the expected level of education like many UCs do, but besides that, the only solution is for students to keep their heads up.",

It\u2019s the same case for lower division cs courses too. There\u2019s a high failure rate due to lack of preparation but that\u2019s does not mean the courses were intended to weed out students. Theres a reason why there\u2019s a lot more resources lower division courses such as tutoring.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, these intro courses are wayy easier than the upper division courses in difficulty and you need these lower division courses as basics. If these courses were truly meant to weed out students they would make the intro courses harder and upper division courses relatively easier. That is not the case and upper division courses are much more difficult than Lower division courses. Cell bio is literally bio 161 on steroids. Also chem 127,chem 124 is actually easier than ap chem. If you did even Honors chem or any form of chem you can do well on chem 124. Even if you haven\u2019t had any chem experience though it\u2019s still very much possible to do well and also chem rn is actually a more watered down version than it was 5 years ago. If calpoly truely intended on weeding out students it wouldn\u2019t make the curriculum easier. \n\n\n\nAs for marginalised students, yea it sucks really hard ngl. Premed and higher education overall favors wealthier individuals overall. Premed especially too since you got to keep your grades up, do well on mcat, and do ecs without pay. It\u2019s really hard to do all of these if you\u2019re a student barely making needs ends. I think it\u2019s more of a flawed education system rather than calpolys fault however and I don\u2019t think calpolys education",

I will admit that I am very fortunate to come in with most of my GEs out of the way due to dual enrollment in high school, so if I could go back I would limit myself to 2 STEM/challenging classes and one easier GE a quarter for the entire first year. I think that's a great way to set yourself up for success, but the best thing you can do is plan out your major and make those important decisions about pacing (or taking summer school or a 5th year to help yourself). For example, I'm taking stats, english, and ethnic studies all online this summer and tuition is only a little over half of what it is during the year for full-time. Hope this helps!",

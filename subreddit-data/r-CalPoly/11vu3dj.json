My son recently got admitted to Cal Poly for Business Admin and I'm wondering if he would be able to add Computer Science as a minor? If so, is it impossible to get CS classes as the CS Majors would have priority and everything is always full? Any feedback about the ability to add a Comp Sci minor would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "It is possible and common. It is difficult to get the classes for the reasons you stated, but the university offers the most sections of the classes required for the minor, due to the volume of students trying to take them. I have multiple friends who have taken the intro cs classes as non cs majors without issue. It leads to a little extra scheduling anxiety as you don\u2019t get classes immediately, but students normally get in off the waitlist during first week of enrollment",

Like for example I think there were only 4 or 5 202 sections fall quarter. \n\n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where even cs majors have hard time getting classes. I think the best way to do it therefore is to get priority some way or try to take it when your far in your degree process",

As others have mentioned it can be difficult to get classes especially in the intro series (101-357) because CS/CPE/SWE majors get priority in the registration process. I found it easier to get classes once I had higher registration status as a junior/senior and was able to get in the first 1-3 on the waitlist. \n\nWhat is he hoping to get out of a CS minor?",

One to Cal Poly under business and the other to UC Santa Cruz under cognitive science. Cognitive science is most likely what he wants to do. He likes to UC Santa Cruz, but said if Cal Poly had a CogSci major, he\u2019d go there in a heartbeat. So, I\u2019m trying to figure out if we can sort of kluge something together that\u2019s close enough. His focus in cognitive science would be on user interface design.",

I'm not super familiar with what a generalized CogSci major entails but from a quick look at UCSC's page, my guess is that you could cobble together a pseudo major with similar classes. This is what I did with CS - I chose the most relevant upper division CS classes from the major such that I basically ended up with a CS degree in all but name. It also seems that CP has a UI/UX [concentration](https://catalog.calpoly.edu/collegesandprograms/collegeofliberalarts/graphiccommunication/bsgraphiccommunication/userexperienceconcentration/) that you could take a look at.\n\nYou can take most any class at Poly if you take the appropriate prerequisites. The business major is also particularly light on units (and generally less workload per unit than CENG classes). Most students who take AP classes come in with credits in advance and more of these credits apply in OCOB than they do in CENG toward GE's. These things will work in his favor if he chooses that route.\n\nIt might take some additional legwork on his part to communicate with professors outside his stated major to get into the classes, but I didn't have all that many issues, especially in upper division classes.\n\nOne thing you might consider is how important having an official degree in the subject matter is for his intended career path. This method worked well for me because Software Engineering is pretty flexible with degrees as long as you can demonstrate you have the needed skillset, but I know other fields like Accounting are not as flexible. What I ended up doing was emphasizing my minor/minor classes/skillset on my resume as much as possible when I was applying for jobs and downplaying the Business aspect of my degree and experience.",

Even with senior standing, I\u2019ve been waitlisted on classes. Getting a CS minor is significantly easier now than it was when I did it. It used to to be a 32 unit requirement now it\u2019s 24. CPE 357 is no longer required, it\u2019s considered one of the hardest classes at Cal Poly. Half of the minor (12 units) is choosing your own classes which helps narrow down on your interests.",

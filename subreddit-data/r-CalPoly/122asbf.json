It\u2019s really not even close. \n\nBut marketing is the real problem here. Job market for marketing is terrible basically everywhere since it\u2019s such an oversaturated industry and you\u2019re also competing with all of the liberal arts and humanities majors who want to be creatives. Most marketing majors leave with jobs as sales, so be warned.",

Many of the business either works at the big 4 for accounting or have consulting jobs. All my friends have jobs and internships line up. I dont know much about SDSU but I heard very good things about the program. I personally think they seem almost equal but could be wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would consider other things too. Cal Poly for example is a very much college town oriented college while SDSU isn't. It also seems like SDSU has a bigger greek life so consider that as well.",

Here is an example of one (of many many) that actively recruits at Cal Poly [https://www.grantthornton.com/careers/students](https://www.grantthornton.com/careers/students) \n\nIn addition, you will also need to apply through MustangJobs or Handshake. [https://careerservices.calpoly.edu/explore-services/mustangjobs](https://careerservices.calpoly.edu/explore-services/mustangjobs)\n\nYou will need a minimum GPA of 3.something, and copies of your transcripts.\n\nAfter that there will be interviews.",

If you are a guy and are not in a frat, going to parties is harder as you\u2019re limited to house/dorm parties (which are significantly more fun tbh), so just find people you like and figure stuff out! It\u2019s very easy to party to the level that you want to. I know people who party multiple times a week and I know people who party like once every few months\n\nHope that helps",

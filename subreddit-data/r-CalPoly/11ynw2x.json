    "postText": "Hi Everyone,\nMy name is Danny. I just got accepted into Cal Poly as a transfer student majoring in Business Administration and I'm looking for a roomate for on-campus housing for this upcoming fall. I am originally from the Bay Area. Some of my hobbies include watching sports, especially basketball, going to the beach, going outdoors on hikes, trying out new restaurants, hanging out with friends and working out. I am super excited to be attending Cal Poly this upcoming fall ! If anyone is interested, please feel free to shoot me a dm.",

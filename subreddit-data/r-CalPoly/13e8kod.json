We get about 20 calls a day asking if we have any tickets or if they can get on the waitlist (which is hundreds of people long) or if they can buy tickets on SeatGeek or sites like that. If you go third party vendor good luck you probably will get scammed. Chances are you aren\u2019t seeing this show",

I was just hoping to be able to see the show from the audience. Worst comes to worst I\u2019ll just watch it from the monitors",

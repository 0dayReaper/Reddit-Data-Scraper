Besides the school itself, professors, and location, what might be different about the two programs between SLO and Pomona\u2019s architecture programs?? \n\nasking to see if its worth going all the way to SLO for architecture when i could be here close by home, unless the programs are drastically different",

I want to look into what regions they hire from because I would much rather end up in SoCal than NorCal. I only got waitlisted at SLO so this is simply a hypothetical post but it may be something to think about eventually if i do end up off the waitlist",

Sure there are a decent amount of SoCal ones, but many of the ones I\u2019ve seen are the larger corporate firms that are harder to get hired by and probably not great to work at.\n\nIf I were you I\u2019d narrow it down to costs, and be skeptical of this being \u201ca better name\u201d school for architecture. For me coming from a low-income family, SLOs arch program has been difficult in terms of what they expect you to invest in your projects while already paying for the most expensive CSU. There\u2019s some \u201cbuild this expensive model\u201d and \u201cvisit this site three hours away\u201d and sometimes \u201cuse this expensive rendering software that we don\u2019t pay for nor teach you how to use\u201d but for whatever reason you have to figure out how to pay for it on your own. I can\u2019t say if Pomona is the same, but I can say that Architecture is definitely a middle class education and profession.",

To me at least cost and proximity is extremely important because of my family life and the fact that its a 5 year program, not the traditional 4 so i need to think of an extra 15-35k i would have to account for depending on school. I also was accepted into Berkeley architecture but I don\u2019t think i will bother with a B.A. program that\u2019s just a pre-professional feeder into their expensive masters programs",

Both are accredited programs. And for the record of comparing institutions, only CPP has an accredited M.Arch program",

    "postText": "Wanted to share what I did for my appeal since I know it\u2019s a question with few answers. \n\n\nStats relevant to SLO: CCC 3.8 gpa/103 units currently and will graduate with 117/non-trad/ 3+years healthcare worker(clinic- back office, think the people who do your intake and give you shots/meds). \n\nMajor: For Cal Poly I applied as biological sciences (aiming for anatomy/physiology concentration). My intended major everywhere else I applied is medical anthropology or at least as close as I could get to it in some cases, but all my classes are done/in progress for a BS in any bio major. \n\n\nThere are more qualifications (EC/academic) that were not relevant to SLO so I didn\u2019t mention them in my appeal. \n\n\nI am about 7 years out of hs and went back to college in spring 2020. Fresh out of HS I went to a 4-year (which is a long story on why I went in the first place and blah blah blah), I ended up becoming depressed, never went to class, and waited for the year to be over. So obviously I failed my classes and left \u201cforcefully\u201d but I didn\u2019t want to be there anyway soooo\u2026. \n\n\nI spent a lot of time after that working on my mental health and gaining financial stability since I had been on my own the day I turned 18(also a long story). I lived life, tried a couple of career paths, joined my current career path, and now ready for fall 23 transfer. \n\n\nFor my appeal I wrote about- \n\n\nWhat I did between my gap in education, how I overcame my academic past, my experience in the medical field, why I have an interest in attending Cal Poly(hands on learning AND THE MARCHING BAND!), and what I\u2019ve learned about attending Cal Poly through my friends and SO who attended many moons ago(I\u2019ve been dragged into multiple campus visits/ attending parades to watch the band which I loved doing). Oh and obviously how I\u2019m going to join the matching band! (I\u2019ve played an instrument for about 17 years? 20 years? Something like that)\n\n\nI\u2019m not being specific about my experiences here because it\u2019s A LOT! But I\u2019m hoping this helps people looking to appeal in the future on what to generally touch on. \n\n\nDate wise, I got my decision on 3/31 appealed that day by 450pm-ish and just received my acceptance decision today!(4/18)\n\n\nIt\u2019s how you portray your story in writing, even if it\u2019s a sad story being it back to a positive. Obviously not everyone will have appeals successfully change a decision but if you do appeal I wish you luck! \n\n\nWhile Cal Poly is a top choice of mine I have 8 decisions yet to be released and cost is going to be a big factor on where I ultimately commit to. I am very excited and grateful to have been accepted!! So, I hopefully see you in the fall!",

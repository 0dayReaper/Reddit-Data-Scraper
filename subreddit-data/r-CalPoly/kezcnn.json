Bold of you to assume I believe in representative \u201cdemocracy.\u201d Man, it\u2019s libs like you that really make my faith in humanity dwindle. Less militarization still fills up prisons. The border is one issue, yes; police in the states you mention still frisk, detain, and kill civilians at their leisure. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not as big a fan of leather as you are. Current coercively enforced laws, made by a disconnected political class, aren\u2019t really just or that helpful to communities. Not constitutional law, not state law, not even your local daycare\u2019s rules. Maybe that last one is a bit helpful. \n\nPrisons obsolete does not mean I wish to see so-called criminals running around hurting others. Again, crime is rooted in a lot of other factor, not exactly morality. If you help fight the source of the disease, you\u2019ll notice the symptoms reduce as well. There are better strategies to dealing with societal outcasts than locking them up and enslaving them. \n\nWhile I am young and naive in certain aspects in life, I certainly believe that the one being childish is none other than you. \n\nGuillotine reserved for the billionaires and politicians, my sweet dandelion. All other \u201cpetty criminals\u201d can be rehabilitated to become part of the community, effectively lifting their outcast status, one of the factors that lead to \u201ccrime.\u201d\n\nWas this helpful for you to understand the magnitude of suffering caused by the police institution?

            "comment": "Hey friends,\n I wanted to share some things that aren't in the description of the video. (If you haven't read the description on YT please do)\n\n1) This was filmed in July. When SLO Sheriff's office initially posted this video they got a lot of backlash for not including masks. When they deleted the video and put up a \"sorry\" statement, they put that it was filmed in April. This was a blatant lie, and their way to quell concerns about mask wearing. However, it obviously was filmed in response to the George Floyd protests in June which means it was filmed after. I'm not sure if someone called them out, but it was changed almost immediately (within 20 minutes) to say July. Unfortunately I don't have the original screenshot, but you can see this if you click on edit history on the fb post.\n\n2) The dog is intentional. On June 23rd, 2020 (remember this was filmed just a week or two after,) a nosy SLO Sheriff's deputy went to investigate a business with its lights on at 11:30 PM. The person present was the business owner who works and lives on site. The deputy shot the dog, but thankfully the dog survived.  https://www.ksby.com/news/local-news/atascadero-dog-on-the-mend-after-being-shot-by-sheriffs-deputy\n\n3) Yes, the \"civilian\" actors are just other officers in plain clothes. \n\n4) as someone mentioned on the initial posts, there is no mention of the LGBTQ+ community. The fact that they mention dogs while excluding voices of the LGBTQ+ speaks volumes. \n\n5) SLO Sheriff's office have been involved in the deaths of several mentally ill people taken into custody. (One as recent as this year, a 62 year old Nipomo man) The county recently settled the murder of Andrew Holland, a schizophrenic man who spent 46 hours in a restraint chair. The settlement was $5 Mill",

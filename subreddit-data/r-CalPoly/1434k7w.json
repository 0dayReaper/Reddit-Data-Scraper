    "postText": "One of my friends had to back out of living with me next year, so I am trying to find another roommate as quickly as possible.\n\nThe house is a condo/townhouse located on the intersection of Broad and Lawrence Dr. which is \\~10 minute drive to campus.\n\nRent is $675 and utilities come out to \\~$100, so totals \\~$775/month.\n\nThe place has a full kitchen, living room, small dining area, a two stall garage and plenty of outdoor parking. The only downside is that I'm looking for someone who is willing to share the master bedroom with me (a guy). The master has a walk in closet, and it's own bathroom, there is plenty of space for two people.\n\nIf you're interested, shoot me a DM and I'll gladly give you more information and a tour!",

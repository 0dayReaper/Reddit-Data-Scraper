We have the same first initial/last name and I recently received his graduation ceremony tickets in my personal email.  Need to reach him to send him his tickets... I found him on LinkedIn but he hasn't accepted my connection request.  Can anyone that is a student who knows Wesley Salzman let him know to email me on gmail with first initial last name to get his commencement ceremony tickets from eventbrite.",

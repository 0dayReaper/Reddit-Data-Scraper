    "postText": "I was wondering if it was possible to get into SLO with a 3.6 gpa and im currently a math major. I still have about a year left before I transfer. I'm currently almost done with my general ed, also just need a couple major classes left. Also doing classes like physics, and a programming class. I got recommended from my counselor to do it since it would increase my chances. I\u2019m also first generation, and poc.",

I also took the physics series and 3 programming classes. \n\nI was super skeptical that I\u2019d get in, I almost didn\u2019t apply. \nI\u2019m so glad that I did. So yeah, it\u2019s totally possible to get in!",

Beware anyone who gives you a straight answer because Cal Poly admissions criteria is a black box. Taking programming now is a great idea! I wish I had more programming experience before I had to learn it in 10 weeks",

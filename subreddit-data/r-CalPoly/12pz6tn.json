    "postText": "Hey..I\u2019m a mom of an accepted physics major. Just returned from open house and looking for some opinions.  Found out that u live in dorms with ur college and some colleges stay on campus 2nd year and some have to move off campus. \nWondering ur opinions.  Is it good to live with ppl in ur college or do u wish u had more options?  What about some kids living on campus for 2 yrs and others leaving? Is it super hard finding housing? Is it weird that entire colleges move off campus while others stay on?  Appreciate anyone with thoughts or experiences!!",

It is not hard to find housing off campus, it is hard to find CHEAP housing. Everything runs 1.2-1.5k for a room (most of the time not including utilities)",

It will also be easier to find roommates next year because everyone in your dorm will be looking for housing together.  Off campus housing doesn't seem super hard to find but it seems like people start signing leases for apartments/houses EARLY.",

            "comment": "Cal Poly has been pushing for 2 yrs on campus because they have data that shows it improves retention and 4 yr graduation rates substantially.  Most California public colleges and university only guarantee housing for the 1st year, so the ability to offer 2yrs is somewhat unique in the Cal State, UC systems.  As others have stated, your child will have options other than rooming with like majors, though that might be the logical choice.  Substance free is full of students \"put\" there by their parents and isn't.   Affinity groups based on minority status or sexual preference might not apply.  Housing is tight in SLO and like many communities in California very expensive.  However literally thousands of students find accommodations every year, I'm sure your child will be able to.",

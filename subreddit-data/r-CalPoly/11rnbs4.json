    "postText": "I\u2019m gonna be taking MATH 350 (Mathematical Software) next quarter with Ryan Tully-Doyle. I can\u2019t seem to find any information on what language it\u2019ll be in, and from what I know and have heard, it\u2019s probably going to be either MATLAB or Mathematica. \n\nAnybody know which one it is? I\u2019ve already taken a class in MATLAB and Mathematica would be hella useful for Classical Mechanics, so I\u2019m lowkey hoping it\u2019s Mathematica",

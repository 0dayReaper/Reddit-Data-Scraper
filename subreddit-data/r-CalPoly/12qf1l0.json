(Even more prestigious schools)\n3) Is it better than CS Lol \n4) Is the CPE major here very \u201cLearn by Doing\u201d?\n5) How are the professors?",

            "comment": "You haven\u2019t given us much to go off of, but I\u2019ll do my best to answer. I have responded to similar posts before so check those out too.\n\n1) Yes? Cal Poly\u2019s engineering programs are quite well regarded. If you want to get a job at a company located in the western US, most companies will know that cal poly produces solid engineers. This isn\u2019t saying that you will be handed a job though. It takes hard work, a good resume, some networking, and a little bit of luck to land a job. This isn\u2019t unique to Poly, and you will likely see this trend at every engineering school.\n\n2) It\u2019s a super great program in my opinion. I wouldn\u2019t say it has TONS of prestige, but cal poly is known for its reputation of producing great engineers rather than being a prestigious institution. Research is usually what garners prestige. I\u2019d say it definitely is on par with the top state schools in CA except for Berkeley EECS (literally the most prestigious program for ECE in the country). Regardless, Cal Poly will not hold you back from getting a top tier education.\n\n3) This is a comparison between an apple and an orange. Despite what many upperclassmen say about the degrees being equivalent, CPE at cal poly is shaping up to be a more unique and useful degree. Yes, you take a lot of the same classes as a CS major, especially at first, but you start to deviate a lot later on. More and more, the department is attempting to steer students away from being a \u201clite\u201d version of the majors it originally combined (EE and CS), and having students actually do the classes that make them a CPE. If you want to do CS, just transfer over to it at cal poly. It\u2019s less units, you\u2019ll have priority registration for upper div cs classes, and you\u2019ll be better prepared for software interviews. I think it\u2019s a free transfer for CPEs. I personally believe CPE has a lot to offer and is a MUCH better major for people who want to pursue the intended career path for CPE.\n\n4) The major is fairly learn by doing. I know they throw this term out a lot, but it really just means that you have a lot more labs and projects. The classes are smaller and you learn less theory in favor of application. \n\n5) The core CPE department professors are fantastic. The CS faculty is fairly good-fantastic (you\u2019ll see a lot of them in your first year). The EE faculty ranges from top tier to terrible. However, this is less of an issue as CPEs take a lot less of the EE curriculum now. Like all schools, you\u2019ll have both good and bad professors, but I find I have more good than bad.\n\nIf you have questions let me know.",

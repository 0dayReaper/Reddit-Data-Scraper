    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nSo I recently committed to Cal Poly, and I know that with conditional admission your have to maintain a 3.0 and not get below a C in any class. The getting a C thing isn\u2019t a problem for me, I expect to have over a C in every class. However there is one class I think I did bad on a final for, so I think I may get a C for. This however causes a problem as I will probably have b to b+ in every other class. However because a C is one point and the one A I have is is worth 4 I am worried about getting a 3.0. So I wanted to ask, in that calculation are AP classes weighted, and are minuses and plusses counted? Lmk and thank you!",

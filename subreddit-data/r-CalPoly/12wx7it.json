            "comment": "I can\u2019t breakdown a decision for you, but for the last con for cal poly (only  offering a bs), why exactly is that a con? \n\nfor the most part, especially for subjects like psych, the BA / BS difference is nil. look into the actual curriculums for psych at each school instead of focusing on the letters after your degree. \n\nlike, for example, my program at CU Boulder would be a BA instead of a BS because of how boulder distinguishes the degree. Both programs are still ACS (chemistry company) certified. A chem degree at Boulder means the same as a chem degree at Poly because of that. \n\nAlso, I see that a lot of your pros for each school overlap, like the research and ap credit one. Trust me, there\u2019s a bunch of research at Cal Poly, and because you won\u2019t be competing with grad students for spots in research groups, you have more of an opportunity to get into one of those groups. It\u2019s even a requirement for graduation via the senior project. Also, the difference in how each take AP credit will be negligible. You can look up both UCSC and Cal Polys policy online and compare. \n\nAlso also, I\u2019d look through more \u201cwhy should I go to Cal Poly\u201d posts throughout this sub regarding the current state of racism at Cal Poly. While I can\u2019t speak regarding this topic (am white and won\u2019t pretend to be well enlightened on this topic), I think that might help give a better picture of campus / slo in general. There\u2019s many reasons Cal Poly isn\u2019t a diverse school, and not all of them stem from blatant racism. \n\n3rd point, as to \u201cnot much to do off campus\u201d, that is what you make of it. Downtown is fun to go to, especially during farmers markets, and there\u2019s plenty of outdoor stuff to do (if that\u2019s up you\u2019re alley). Also, many clubs host things on and off campus regularly. Don\u2019t knock it till you try it! \n\nHonestly, looking over your pros and cons, it sounds like you believe that there will be more opportunity at Cal Poly, which I agree with.",

            "comment": "Things like 'free laundry' aren't going to make a difference to your college experience. Nor will however many credits you get/don't get from APs. Also, going home often (especially during freshman year) makes it very hard for people to make friends. Cant speak to psych in particular- but if you are research and grad school oriented, I think get a BS for sure. \n\nJust go with your gut.",

Also I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201conly offers bs\u201d yes it is a bachelors of science but I\u2019m not sure what is bad about it. Cal Poly does offer a masters in psych though. However, it\u2019s an emphasis on LMFT.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I am a recent college grad and was hoping to get your opinions on something. Over the last few years, I have perfected the art of landing an internship and have successfully secured offers at top companies such as Intel, Apple, and Microsoft. I am now considering offering my skills to other students who may need some extra guidance.\n\nI would provide 1:1 interview coaching, resume development, and teach students how to land interviews. I want to know what you guys think about this idea. Is this something that students would use or be interested in? I value your honest opinions and feedback.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this post, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!",

In 248, he would occasionally plug higher level courses like 445 around similar topics, so I take he has an especially deep interest in it, if that's a relevant quality to how you pick your professors.\n\nOther than that, he's a generally nice guy. Because he's enthusiastic about the topics he comes off more approachable anyways.",

My idea of a good time is digging trail, bonfire, hike, mtb etc. there\u2019s for sure groups for this stuff but even in them there\u2019s a little much of a party element for me and it just brings the vibe down imo",

Target markets need to be very specific in the beginning, and the exact causes for this problem will likely differ a bit from campus to campus (depending on the culture, the amount of events the school holds, what majors are most common, etc). I hope to be able to talk to people in person at Cal Poly to hear from them directly and figure out where I need to start.",

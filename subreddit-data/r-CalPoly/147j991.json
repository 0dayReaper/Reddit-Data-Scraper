Without an actual video proving assault, you're asking a bunch of strangers on the internet to help you track down two women who, as far as we know, just got into a yelling match with someone . Hell, we don't even know if you are the actual someone they got into it with.   \n\nYou may have video that shows an actual assault, but I'd be careful about sharing these images online without the corroborating video and asserting that the women in the photos assaulted you. Defamation of character is also against the law.",

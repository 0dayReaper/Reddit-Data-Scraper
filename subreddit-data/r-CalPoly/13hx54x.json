    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman, currently signed up as an English major, but thinking of pursuing a more engineering-focused degree with a minor in English. \n\nIs this at all possible or is the college of engineering just too competitive? I am not interested in mechanical, probably something like environmental engineering. My grades in HS are above average, but not quite 4.0 level, and i am graduating with 5 APs passed  (Calc AB, Physics II, Spanish, Lit, and Lang)",

            "comment": "Environmental would pair very well with an English minor. I was an EnvE major for a little and I went to competition this year with a team of EnvE\u2019s. They get the most exposure to technical writing. When it came to writing the report, they were masters at it. I\u2019m sure English would help with any engineering degree, but I feel like EnvE\u2019s use it the most. It isn\u2019t an easy degree though. They may have easier fluids and thermo, but they have to take Organic Chemistry and Microbiology. \nAs for switching into CEng, it\u2019s not impossible, but it is pretty hard. Just get good grades and you will probably have to do a ICMA (take Calc, Phys, and Chem and get good grades).",

The CLA people constantly destroyed stuff around the dorms and made messes etc. Also extremely loud and annoying. I would probably recommend pride community for that. Gay people are better by far",

The major difference is who you want to hang out with, if the pride community is your kind of people and you want to feel safe and understood there I would go there. CLA is going to put you with people in similar programs so you will probably see more academic benefit from the CLA housing with study partners and the like. I would say if you're worried about making friends go with Pride and if you think you will have no issues making friends and want the academic benefit go for CLA",

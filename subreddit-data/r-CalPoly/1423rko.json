Factors to think about are if you'll be too tired by 10pm, if you expect to finish STAT 331 early and would have enough break without moving it (you should probably eat lunch), really need the extra day of studying, or just want your quarter to be done sooner. Having a whole day Thursday to study for only one Friday final is an underrated quarter-ender for me.",

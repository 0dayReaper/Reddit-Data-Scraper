    "postText": "So I\u2019m a computer engineering major, and I\u2019ve been applying for some internships and jobs with no luck. I have a decent GPA and feel like I\u2019m ready to apply some of my knowledge. I\u2019m interested in a pretty wide array of topics in my major, but I don\u2019t really have an idea of how I\u2019m supposed to focus my attention (I\u2019ve focused a bit on game development doing some extracurricular stuff but haven\u2019t seen a real interest in the industry for Cal Poly graduates). Has anyone been in a similar boat and figured out how to get out of it? I just feel kinda stuck, school is going well but career and job stuff is a bit of a rut and don\u2019t know how to get out it.",

I spammed applications everywhere, so just apply to everything. Always go into technical detail of what you know.\n\nSide note: large companies doing massive layoffs make the number of internships available probably go down (my own guess, nothing to back that up).",

I agree that gaming really does seem niche, and many of the job offers that are around seemed to be a bit exploitative (underpaid, lots of crunch, etc.) so I may just avoid it and stick to game development as a hobby. Honestly most of my projects are game dev related projects (did multiple game jams and have a pretty sizeable game art portfolio), but I'm thinking I may take on another type of project to make myself a more competitive applicant (like I've always either wanted to do a project in sustainability/EV stuff or something in aerospace).",

            "comment": "If I was in your year again, I'd get involved in an academic club or a professional organization like IEEE, CPES, SHPE, NSBE etc. In addition to those involvements + the projects being a good resume booster, it's also a great network opportunity. As a matter of fact, I recommend doing club projects for your side projects as opposed to doing solo-project since it gives you the opportunity to build that networking relationship with people in the club. I'd primarily network with the upperclassmens in those club, but still network with anyone whose involve in them. Those same people you network with, are the same ones who can help you get an internship through a referral, resume help, or even insight on what interview questions they got ask for the company you plan to apply for. Being involve in those clubs/organizations can also give you access to alumni who used to be apart of that club, or even internships/job opportunities only available for that specific club. \n\nMost of the people I talked to in my 3rd year got their internships either through a referral, or applied for an internship opportunity on the \"down-low\". The ones I know who managed to land an internship via an online application were cracked students(3.5+ GPA). What I mentioned in the previous previous paragraph should give you an idea on how to get those referrals. Imo, you are more likely to get better responses for internship application through a referral than through an online application. \n\nI personally know someone who got an internship in a similar way(networking via club involvement) which lead to a full time offer. That same company is also asking him/her for students that they can refer them to for their next internship cycle. Many upperclassmens in various academic clubs and professional organizations are in a similar position. You just have to find them.\n\nIf you manage to get a referral from an upperclassmen in a club you're involved in that lead to an internship offer, be sure to pass that favor forward to the next underclassmen :)\n\nEdit: I wouldn't worry about your performance in those club project. Put in some effort and don't abandon in. Better to have some lackluster side-project on your resume than nothing at all. And even if you didn't contribute a major part into the project, I'd still list it on the resume but embellish it heaviliy. Many upperclassmens who are really passionate about a club project they're working on will see your efforts which can possibily lead to a future referral when you start doing internship/job applications.",

You can also get your resume reviewed on r/csMajors or r/EngineeringResumes. defintiely listen to the advise of u/daifukuYum too though.\n\nBiggest things that don't get emphasized enough though:\n\n1. First step is getting the interview. Build some side projects in the area you want to work to make you a more competitive candidate in that space. I was going for general SWE roles, so I've built some web apps and other projects that interested me. Get your resume reviewed through the other stated resources.\n2. Passing the interview -- DS&amp;A -- A lot of CS internships are really competitive, and many will ask you to do leetcode questions for technical interviews. Additionally, work on your communication as much as possible, for both explaining your code as you write it and for general interview questions. look up neetcode 150 or blind75 for this. \n\nfeel free to ask any other general questions you have.",

    "postText": "I got accepted into Cal Poly for Business and I\u2019m planning to concentrate in accounting. I am tagging UCSB for Econ/Accounting. I received about 6k in scholarships from Cal Poly. I am yet to receive any aid from UCSB since UC decisions aren\u2019t out yet for transfers. I do enjoy to party but I\u2019m not super big on it and will mostly likely not join Greek life. I like camping, backpacking, surfing, and fishing. I am open to attending grad school, but will mostly likely not. I eventually want to move out of California or at least LA. \n\nPros for UCSB \n- Location \n- Campus \n- Good Social Scene \n- Good Job opportunities for Accounting\n\nCons for UCSB \n- No Business College \n- Econ focused \n- Requirements to be admitted into the major \n- I don\u2019t remember much from macro/micro at CC\n\nPros for Cal Poly \n- Many different majors and minors \n- I could explore my other interests \n- Learn by doing\n- Good Job Opportunities \n- better waves, camping, hiking \n\nCons for Cal Poly \n- Didn\u2019t like the campus as much as Sb \n- Smaller town and more isolated\n- everyone lives more spread out \n\nIf anyone has any insight or advice it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks In advanced !",

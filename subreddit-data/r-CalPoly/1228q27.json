    "postText": "I'm only posting because I'm more curious than upset about my college of engineering admission decision. My stats - 4.33 GPA, an honest 21+ hours of leadership &amp; extracurricular, 7 AP's, 4 AP scores w/ all 5's, and one CC course in summer precalculus - are all easy above last year's middle 50% average. \n\nI get that's only the middle 50%, and this year might be *more* competitive, but isn't CSU acceptance in general essentially based on an algorithm, since there's no written portions? I'm happy I'm on the waitlist so that there's a chance at least, but what the heck SLO?",

Oh, and he changes what the results mean when he feels like it.\n\nNo one here really knows how it works. Honestly, I don\u2019t think even admissions knows how it works. Do people think they know how it works? Yes. Are there patterns and trends? Totally. Do I know where I\u2019m going with this? Kind of.\n\nI know this is frustrating, I get it. I wish I could tell you it was simple and lay it out, but it\u2019s not. Honestly anyone who claims to know anything for certain is either lying, or doesn\u2019t know enough to realize they don\u2019t know anything. Best of luck to you on your endeavors. Remember, the college you pick isn\u2019t going to be the deciding factor in how your life turns out. You got this",

I know ppl with like 3.7 gpa out of high school in the same CS program as me. However, if you're like me who doesn't qualify for any aid and is from a big city in cali, your chances are extremely low. Almost everyone I know from somewhat rich areas had much better stats than you. Personally, I had 9 aps with 3 cc courses and I know friends that had 13 aps, so your stats are on the lower end. Volunteering is negligible because they don't even ask for what you did, it's just the amt of hours.",

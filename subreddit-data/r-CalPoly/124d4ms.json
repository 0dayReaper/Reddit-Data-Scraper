I would like to live somewhere where people are active and I can meet new people. Can anyone share their experiences at these places?",

Housing and dining shows up in future dues but tuition price doesnt show up until near the beginning of the quarter. \n\n[http://www.housing.calpoly.edu/student-housing/transfer-graduate-student-housing/transfer-graduate-student-housing-fees](http://www.housing.calpoly.edu/student-housing/transfer-graduate-student-housing/transfer-graduate-student-housing-fees) This breaks down the charges for you. Also the PCV double is the cheapest but most people dont want to get an apartment and have the possibility of sharing a room with someone else",

I lived in yak last year, and everyone on my floor almost always had their doors propped open, and that is simply not the case with pcv. In pcv from my experience, is definitely not about meeting new people, but going to visit your core group of friends that you met your first year.",

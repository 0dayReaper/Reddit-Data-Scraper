Both are lower level GEs I was blocked into as an engineering major.  Enjoyed the classes and did great in both.  Plus, the asynch psych was less busy work than in-person. Trust me\u2026you will like the flexibility these type of classes give you with the fast pace of the quarter system.   If you don\u2019t want to take them you can adjust your blocked schedule during allotted enrollment times.",

I know they had evidence of Flores raping other women, and small traces of unknown blood and decomposition under his deck.  His attorney said that evidence wasn't good enough, but maybe the prosecutor convinced the jury that Flores didn't have a reasonable alibi.  \n\nI haven't listened to the podcast, for what that's worth.",

It really was a different time despite only being 20 years ago.  I want somebody to be locked up with sound evidence.

All around bullshit though.\n\nI agree that it should have been admissible, but I wouldn\u2019t necessary agree that\u2019s the norm to include and I think it could in theory open up the case to a retrial.

Reasonable doubt doesn\u2019t require an eyewitness at all times or dna proof. Think back-Flores was last seen with Kristin on a holiday weekend when the campus was basically deserted at 2am! He\u2019s as obvious user and abuser of women and Kristin would not have abandoned her family unless she were dead. There simply is no other conclusion to draw than Flores did it nor would anybody else even have had the opportunity and he was caught in too many lies about where he got the black eye immediately after her disappearance plus could never tell a straight story  about what happened that night without contradictions. His mother also told a co-worker he called his father who raced out of the house to help him that night. Had the jury known Ruben did this am sure he would have been convicted too.\n\nThis judge was also extremely careful and I do not foresee anything being reversed due to judicial error on appeal should the Flores family even pursue that. They may file a Notice of Appeal but will they file it and even if they did, I don\u2019t see it being successful.",

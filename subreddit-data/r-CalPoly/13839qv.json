            "comment": "3.0 gpa + is enough for grad school. 3.5+ or 3.7+ gets you preferred qualification when applying to companies like Northrop Grumman for your first job. Some companies like 3.2+.\n\nIf you withdraw from that class this quarter, will you be able to get an A from it in the future? Is it required you get a C or above in it as a prerequisite for future classes? If you\u2019ll get a C in it even with another quarter and it\u2019s not a prereq, I would just take the D grade and spend your time doing something else. \n\nRather than retaking a class you\u2019re struggling in and will likely get a low-ish grade in again, your time is probably better spent attending career center webinars and learning how to build up your resume, write cover letters, do interviews and make/fill out an engineering portfolio - stuff to get you a good internship over the summer(s) and a good job. It takes time! \n\nIf you\u2019ll feel a lot of regret with a D on your transcript however, do what satisfies you. The main thing here is to feel happy with how you\u2019ve spent your time and be proud of your time in college. Set yourself up for success in the future and be confident in your abilities when applying for and starting your dream jobs in the future.",

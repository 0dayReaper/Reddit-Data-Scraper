    "postText": "Hey! So, I'm a transfer student about to start my third year at Cal Poly. I'm majoring in Computer Science. But, I'm kinda clueless about what to expect and how to get ready for the classes coming up. Do you have any pointers or tips on how I can get myself prepped up for these upper division classes and what to practice? Thanks a bunch!",

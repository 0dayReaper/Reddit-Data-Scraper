    "postText": "I applied to Cal Poly sort of last minute because I read about it\u2019s CS program. I also saw that the acceptance rate was like 3% (?) so I basically forgot I even applied but I somehow got in.\n\nI know acceptance rate shouldn\u2019t really be a factor when choosing a school but I just want to get an idea of how lucky I got or if the stats I\u2019m seeing online are just outright wrong. \n\nAlso if anyone that is currently taking CS can tell me what it\u2019s like that would be great.",

Both CS and EE are projected to admit ~200 people (100 for CpE).\n\nIncidentally, that's how I got into CS. I originally applied to EE in 2017, switched to CpE, and finally CS.",

            "comment": "The cs program here is amazing!! Poly cs is an interesting situation in that we\u2019re an amazing and selective program that doesn\u2019t really play the prestige game. Because of that some people i\u2019ve met chose poly over less selective schools and other people chose it over more. IK at least for me and my friends that are in cs, we picked cal poly over schools like ucsd, ucla, georgia tech, boston u, hamilton, tufts, northeastern, duke, uw, etc if that\u2019s any indicator to you of how strong our program is. The professors I\u2019ve had (starting my upper divs now) have also all been phenomenal and the opportunities are amazing, especially considering the market rn (got an on campus apple interview within like a month of starting college).\n\nthat being said, the acceptance rate for cs is a little higher than 3%, that\u2019s the admit rate (meaning it doesn\u2019t account for yield) our total yield rate is 27% but it\u2019s likely higher for engineering and specifically cs. So i\u2019d guess our cs acceptance rate is closer to 6-8%. (still harder to get into than a humanities major at cornell \ud83d\ude12)",

This is not really useful particularly useful, but it encompassed a majority of my interests since middle school. I might not switch though because of the priority problems it might cause, but I'm definitely going to take cpe courses as tech electives.",

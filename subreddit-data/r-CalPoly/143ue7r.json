    "postText": "According to the National Library of Medicine, in 2020, about 40% of undergraduate students in the US suffer from test anxiety. Here at Cal Poly, counseling services reported that 50% of students that visited reported some kind of anxiety during the 2016-2017 school year (Carpenter,2018). That's about 10,000 out of more than 20,000 students. As a student here, and someone who has studied hard and still blanks during midterms and finals, this is a major concern. \n\nApproaching testing anxiety here at Cal Poly as students calls for a collective effort from you, faculty, and the entirety of the institution. Trying to get rid of testing anxiety as a whole is unrealistic and you should instead look to minimize the impact that testing anxiety has on you instead. With your help, you can encourage friends and fellow students to create an environment that promotes well-being and the empowerment of all students here at Cal Poly to overcome and minimize the prevalence of testing anxiety altogether.",

            "comment": "As somebody who has SEVERELY struggled with test anxiety and blanking, I totally agree. Exams are designed to test stress management, not actual knowledge. If profs want to change this, they have plenty of options. The options that I\u2019ve found helpful are allowing test corrections (so we can actually learn from our mistakes, what?), group exams (to allow collaboration, what??), and allow students to use their notes on exams. My prof for circuits this quarter allows us to use our notes, so when I blanked on my midterm, I was able to unstick myself and I didn\u2019t cry after the exam. If profs knew how damaging exams are to their students mental health, it would def be beneficial.",

Most of the exam are problems that we\u2019ve never seen before, so the notes are just there to help us brainstorm how to solve the puzzles. Why should I be pressured to memorize shit when I have it all written down for MY use and for MY eyes only? Shouldn\u2019t professors encourage the use of notes because you don\u2019t actually have to memorize random equations in real life?",

            "comment": "When you are experiencing stress, adrenaline and cortisol in your bloodstream cause the blood vessels of your brain to be constricted causing less blood flow. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t think clearly. It\u2019s a physiological response because your body is trying to shunt blood to your large muscles so you can run away. Crying after tests is not normal and is a way of your body relieving the stress we internalize.\n\nPlease see your physician and a counselor or therapist/psychologist be super honest about your anxiety. There are medicines like beta blockers that can really help performance anxiety, and work by lessening the effects of adrenaline. If you get a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, you can get testing accommodations from the DRC. \n\nAnxiety can be caused by a number of underlying conditions like untreated ADHD, having had adverse childhood experiences, and other types of trauma or brain differences. It\u2019s a really good idea to get checked out by a physician and psychologist/psychiatrist for this reason. The Health Center and Counseling Center are great resources. \n\nBreathing techniques can help you increase the amount of oxygen going to your brain and calm you over time. Eating or chewing some thing can help calm you, as well as having a regular meditation practice.\n\nAs someone who has worked closely with faculty in 10+ majors, and been in their classes, I have to say that I have never, ever met a member of faculty who has purposely made an assessment extra stressful on their students. Completely retire the idea that they are trying to make it harder on you. That said, teaching styles vary, but are changing to make assessments lower stakes activities.",

I also took physics: vibrations and the final was 50% of my grade. Why would my HALF OF MY TOTAL grade be dependent on a SINGLE exam? Imagine your job was dependent on whether you can pass a single exam? In real life, you\u2019re RARELY put under pressure do to absolute perfect. Idk if you\u2019ve been to many STEM classes, but a lot have professors who have crazy high standards who think that a 40% average is good.",

Physics classes where the curriculum is set and then given to lots of different people to teach in lots of different ways* and then given common finals because so many majors have to take that class, is a different ballgame. I want to really reassure you that they are still not trying to cause students to fail. I was mostly speaking to engineering and engineering pre-reqs classes.\n\nMy main point is that making professors or CP out as some negative entity that is intentionally scheming to make you fail or trip you up, will only make the anxiety worse. Their job performance metrics are calculated by including student feedback and grades. So it doesn\u2019t make sense that they would want grades to be low as it\u2019s in their best interest to have a good result. \n\nThere are a lot of reasons why some students perceive the first year or two to be very difficult and they can start to feel a certain sense of repression. Most of them having to do with their level of psychological readiness/resilience, and the stresses of getting to college, and being on your own for the first time, and young adulthood brain development being ongoing. Many feel a \u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d experience because they\u2019re used to being high-achieving, and regard that as being part of their identity. Then when they arrive at Cal Poly, the academic rigor is much higher than anything they\u2019ve experienced and usually it requires a lot more attention to detail, and strategic planning that students may not be used to or ready for. It is at the same time that students may realize they have learning differences/learning disabilities, brain differences or mental health issues which are brought to the surface by having to balance multiple classes, multiple labs, new living situation and social strata, not having their normal support network nearby to lean on, etc\u2026\n\nIt takes time to adapt, grow or regrow neural connections for your new environment, and develop or learn techniques to coordinate and manage these new situations. \n\n\n*see my mention of teaching styles, they vary widely\n\n** course redesigns, i.e., making more tests lower stakes: group tests, practice tests, take home tests, open note tests and having tests more often, are sweeping post-secondary education, and being push out to and taught in course accessibility and pedagogy courses for faculty. Progress ,as with any large institution, is too slow.",

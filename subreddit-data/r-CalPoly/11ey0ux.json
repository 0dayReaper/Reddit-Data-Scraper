I hope someone in Electrical Engineering reads this and responds. \n\nFrom what I read, I am getting mixed responses from many EE students about their time at Cal Poly. \n\nPROS:\n\n-Location and Weather\n-Hands on labs/projects\n-Smaller Class sizes\n\nPersonally I\u2019m more of a hands-on learner and think that Cal Poly was a no brainer (since I wasn\u2019t into research schools and their theoretical practices), but I just wanted to clarify about the issues at this school and see if it really is THAT bad. \n\nCONS: \n\n-Apparently the EE program is a mess\n  \u2022ME Program has better EE equipment (than the actual EE dept.)\n-The professors can be hit or miss\n-The classes can be considered TOO easy, maybe the standards aren\u2019t as high comparing other majors maybe\n\n\nIn short, I just want a definitive answer on how things are now. And if it\u2019s worth to turn down UC San Diego and etc. for Cal Poly. Pros outweigh the cons and such. I am passionate and want to do my best in what I want to do, again many thanks.",

            "comment": "Hey guys, I was accepted in CS, and I had a couple of questions if anyone who is already at the school could answer some of these for me. Thanks in advance.\n\n1) I heard that the diversity isn't that great there. Would you guys say that you've seen some consequences of this? Like certain people being treated a certain way or certain jokes circulating that are targeted towards certain groups (ofc you'll get a little bit of this no matter where you go, but I sometimes hear that it's worse at cal poly)\n\n2) How are the clubs and stuff outside of academics? Some things I was potentially interested in was hip hop dance, jiu jitsu, wrestling, or possibly Japanese langauge. On the website's list of clubs I didn't see much but I was wondering if there was more that aren't listed.\n\n3) One thing that was a possible concern for me was the location. I hear it's pretty rural, and I'm assuming that there aren't any big cities anywhere nearby. Do you guys sometimes have troubles finding fun stuff to do in your free time? I usually like going to concerts and stuff but I'm wondering if I'll need to stop.\n\n4) I did some marching band in high school and even did blue devils B for a year, and was thinking about joining the marching band. Can someone who is in there let me know about how competitive and hard it is to get into the marching band? I've marched before but was alright at it. I also heard that if you're in the marching band you get priority registration for fall and winter. Is this true?",

Looks like it\u2019s impossible for me to graduate within 2 years as a transfer since a lot of the courses I would have taken as a first and second year were not offered at my ccc. Does anybody know the average time it takes a transfer student to graduate and will I really need to take an additional almost 10 courses to do so?",

There are a lot of balls in the air right now and they\u2019re super busy and TIRED. It has been a heck of a quarter and everyone is still working hard but a bit burnt out. Give them and yourself time, and grace. Monday is a work day so more will come out this week. Also, just for good measure\u2026always check your JUNK FOLDER.

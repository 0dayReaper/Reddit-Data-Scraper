I was also given the opportunity to enroll to be a Cal Poly Scholar, which I accepted and listed as my first choice for RLC. Suppose I accept EOP, how does that change?",

There are more specific ones for each as a first year, you can find on their websites. I know that for EOP you have to meet once a quarter with a counselor, to check your classes, grades and how you are doing. And for scholar's you have to go to at least 3 events that they have.Again, I would recommend looking into their website!",

Dont really worry too much though because scholars, eop and trio are all usually grouped together anyway for housing. Scholars just gets more choices in room picking.\n\nI didnt do eop simply because I didnt feel like writing anything but if you want more award money then you should. I dont know that much about the program activities but I don't think its a big time commitment either.",

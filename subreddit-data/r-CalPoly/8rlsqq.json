And I'm supposed to confiscate your card to stop you from trying again\"\n\nThis dude took the freshman's polycard and the freshmans dad pulled out a credit card and paid.\n\nThat's some next level bullshit poly.",

If I were that freshman, I would have just been like \u201cAll this food is for me.\u201d Also, I\u2019m pretty sure they can\u2019t just take your PolyCard. They shoulda called UPD because that\u2019s theft. Even if they can deny you service, they cannot just take your property.\n\nThat\u2019s gotta be one of the most ridiculous policies I\u2019ve ever heard and I have a hard time believing it\u2019s a Campus Dining-wide policy. The parents paid for every dollar loaded onto that PolyCard and they can\u2019t even get a shitty bagel for it!\n\nHonestly, that cashier may just be taking the card to buy themselves stuff. If they know money\u2019s on it, they could just swipe it and buy themselves some shitty bagels \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\n/rant",

It was an attempt to avoid poly card theft, I guess. We never had a policy for buying food for others. At least, it was never mentioned ever. \n\nOP should\u2019ve brought it up to management, or the kid with poly dollars should\u2019ve. Either way, this is ridiculous. People can spend money however they want.",

It\u2019s actually a problem because if the ID is real they can sell it to people who make fakes/trying to forge. \n\nNot saying that\u2019s what happened here, this is just some power hungry Einstein\u2019s manager. Still good to know though that people just can\u2019t take your stuff, period. \n\nEspecially when you\u2019re just trying to buy your family some food with what is essentially your own money lol",

The only policy we're told is that the person on the PolyCard has to be physically present (ie. you can't say \"oh I'm picking it up for them\"), and even then as long as they have a photo of them together or something we usually let it slide. And we definitely don't confiscate the card, even if we suspect something fishy.\n\nThat employee straight up stole the guy's card.",

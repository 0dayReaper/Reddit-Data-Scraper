I think the only class is CE113 where you learn autocad, but there are computer labs for that class, so you are fine. \nAs for a personal laptop recommendation. I use a  Asus Zephyrus g14. It\u2019s been able to run SOLIDWORKS for hours without issue. I\u2019ve had a great experience with it, but I\u2019ve had a friend who had 2 brick on him in the first 3 months of owning each. I just let it run for 3 days straight when I got it and it\u2019s worked great.",

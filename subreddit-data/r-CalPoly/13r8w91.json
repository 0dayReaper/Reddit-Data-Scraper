Both times they ended up printing 2-3 extra stickers to not waste paper I assume which I appreciate. That deal is hard to beat.\n\nI also used UGS on campus to print a bunch of stickers, they\u2019ve held up really well over the years and I don\u2019t remember how much I paid but pretty sure it ended up being &lt;1$/sticker (2\u201dx3\u201d). The colors came out slightly grainy when you look closely but I still like them and would have used it again if I didn\u2019t graduate right after! Back when I did it, it was kind of unofficial and all handled over email, not sure if that\u2019s changed but I\u2019m sure the info is on their website.",

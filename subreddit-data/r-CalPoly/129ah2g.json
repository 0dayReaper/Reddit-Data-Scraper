            "comment": "Shouldn't be too difficult. I switched from msci to chemistry my second quarter. After I submitted my eligibility form over winter break I had to talk to the head of the chem / biochem department, who was very chill. Then I entered an ICMA briefly. \n\n[Changing majors info and what ICMA means.](https://advising.calpoly.edu/change-major)\n\nYour ICMA process might be a quarter or two, however. The main reason mine was so short (literally approved the same day) was because I did well in chem 127 and was very firm in becoming a chem major. Looking at the flowchart for public health, you won't be blocked into chem 127 until second quarter. (flowchart can be found [here](https://flowcharts.calpoly.edu/downloads/mymap/22-26.76HLTHBSU.EMPH-.pdf)). If you're sure about switching into bio / chem / biochem, then that would technically put you behind. (see flowcharts: [biochem](https://flowcharts.calpoly.edu/downloads/mymap/22-26.76BCHMBSU.pdf), [biology](https://flowcharts.calpoly.edu/downloads/mymap/22-26.76BIOBSU.pdf), and [chemistry](https://flowcharts.calpoly.edu/downloads/mymap/22-26.76CHEMBSU.pdf)). Note that chem 124 and chem 127 are essentially the same class and credit in one would count for the other, \n\nThis does not make it impossible to switch, however, nor does it put you in jeopardy of graduating in 4 years. I can't tell you how exactly it will go down, but know that all people at cal poly dont follow the flowchart exactly. I recommend reaching out to admissions / mustang success center to see if you can be blocked into chem 127 fall quarter and get a better sense for the process to switch majors. Feel free to PM if you have any other questions!",

Hell, I was able to switch majors between different colleges and it still went smoothly. \n\nThat being said, talk to an advisor. REGULARLY. Like at least once a month. They\u2019re extremely helpful and really simplify the process.",

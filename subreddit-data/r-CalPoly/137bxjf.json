            "comment": "If you submitted your test scores/transcripts and passed Calc 1 through AP or equivalent, you will most likely be blocked into Calc 2 first quarter (I took two years of AP Calc and passed the AP exams and I was blocked into Calc 3 my first quarter) You can change your block schedule, but I highly recommend talking to the Mustang Success Center before dropping any classes. The flowchart is really just a suggestion and it\u2019s a lot nicer to be ahead in a class or two than to fall behind!",

Waiting until winter to take it is also an option, but  it may not be smart to wait. The flowchart is really just a suggestion, you can take classes in whatever order works best for you.",

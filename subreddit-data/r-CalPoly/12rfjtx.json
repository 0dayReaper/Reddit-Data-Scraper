    "postText": "Hi people,\n\nI'm a high school senior I've been admitted into SLO as a Philosophy major but was wondering about the process of getting onto the pre-med track, how easy it would be to get pre-med classes as a Philosophy major, and what minor openings are there as well? Is there a pre med advisor and are they helpful? How difficult is it to get to get a strong GPA? Is there a pre med community?\n\nAny advice is helpful, thanks!",

            "comment": "Hi! Congrats on your acceptance!\nThe advising center for the college of science and math does pre-health advising for the entire campus, so their advisors will be the most helpful!\nThe most easy major to get your pre-med classes is BIO but, you can technically be pre-med with any major as long as you take all the necessary courses! It will likely be harder to get the classes you need as a PHIL major since it\u2019s a lot of math, physics, chemistry, etc. that you\u2019ll need, but with determination it is possible! There is a pre-health club for building community and check out www.prehealth.calpoly.edu for more info/to get you started.",

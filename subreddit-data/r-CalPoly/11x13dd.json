Other than that we got the nice dorms and priority reg! You can always drop it later after you get the perks lol. They also are willing to help set you up with tutors and there\u2019s lots of research opportunities",

I ended up making regular classes into honors classes by doing extra work. What was annoying was that freshman fall quarter their math honors class was calculus. Any honors student would have already taken and passed calculus. Since math and science classes were my strength not English and history, those were the type of classes I wanted to take but they were all a quarter behind my schedule. I didn\u2019t want to get behind on my schedule so I didn\u2019t take them. Ended up having to drop out of the honors program due to availability of classes.",

            "comment": "It will probably be easier to get good grades at SJSU. I don\u2019t know if GPA outweighs research experience. Cal Poly is great for undergrad research and your degree will go further if you don\u2019t end up taking the medicine path because it\u2019s Cal Poly and we have the best undergraduate education.",

There\u2019s a lot of great teachers like frantz, eagon, and Wilkinson. I would use polyratings to get a good sense of good teachers. I know that chem department does tutoring but I didn\u2019t really need tutoring but it was nice to have as a resource",

I suggest Kantorowski for ochem, Campbell for biochem (don\u2019t take Watts..), and Groves for gen chem. As for microbio, Martinez is amazing! You just have to make sure you dedicate time to actually memorize each of the topics because everything Carrie\u2019s over into each class",

If they\u2019re still around, take Seth Bush for whatever classes he offers (gen chem in my day), Meisenheiner for whatever she offers (ochem in my day), Immoos for anything he offers (quant and more back then), and Hagen for Pchem. Stay away from Fogel and Lehr (they\u2019re lovely and caring people but their teaching style is a bit rough).\n\nLabs were fun. Don\u2019t get back to back Friday lectures and risk having quizzes and midterms next to each other.",

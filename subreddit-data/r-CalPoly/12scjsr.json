    "postText": "hellooo! I am a transfer student who will be starting as a CRP major in fall at SLO, I am transferring from a community college and there were not a lot of courses specific to city and regional planning that I could take to prepare myself for upper division classes in this major, I am finishing my classes for an associates in environmental studies and plan to keep that as my focus in school. I just wanted to hear about other students experiences in CAED or maybe what to expect as incoming transfer going into CRP! thank uuu!",

I have been trying to prepare myself for the three years two of which I will definitely be playing catch up... but as a CC student I am definitely excited to take courses that are actually apart of my major! Im glad to hear from someone in the same year as me and i'll see you in studio next year! ! Just curious what was the most difficult CRP course you have taken so far or your favorite?",

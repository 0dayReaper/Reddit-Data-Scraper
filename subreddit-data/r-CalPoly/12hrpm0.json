    "postText": "I am a third year Sikh student here at SLO and wanted to start a Sikh Student Association (SSA). This is a club that is found at a bunch of other universities in California including UC Davis, Berkeley, Santa Barbara and many more. I've noticed more Sikh students this year than when I was first on campus and I think it's a good time to get SSA started at Cal Poly. If you're interested pls lmk, I need four other members before petitioning for this club! I'm really excited to get this started and meet some new people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S: Ik it's called Sikh Student Association but you obviously don't have to be a Sikh to join. If you're Punjabi or interested in Punjabi culture I think this club would be perfect for you too. The SSA is just to be consistent with the existing clubs across universities.",

I'm a local professional photographer (Pismo) and I'm down to donate my photography to you and the group to help get you great photos that can help you promote the association. We can also do member portraits and I can cover an event or two for you, too.\n\nI'm not religious at all, but Sikhs are some of the best people on the planet, period. I'm up for helping you guys grow. \n\nMy website: https://namu.love",

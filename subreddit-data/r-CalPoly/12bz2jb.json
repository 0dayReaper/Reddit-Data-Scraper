I was wondering if anyone would share their experiences finding housing off campus. \n\nI found out mid-March that I was accepted and have been looking since then but i either do not get responses from listings or there are ridiculous requirements like monthly income being 3x rent.",

That\u2019s how I found a room off-campus in which I live with 3 other cal poly students! Usually renting a room in a house with other students is a cheaper alternative imo!",

An average university tuition is 60k/yr. and that\u2019s in states for lots of university. Phew looks at that students debts ha.\n\nThird of all, wasted? Pssst. US is being built by immigrants, and stays at the top of the world before because of immigrants. Don\u2019t believe me? Check H1V Visa - special Visa for technical work Visa during WW1 &amp; WW2.

(That\u2019s something you are leaving out of your narrative with the OP. The United States Government believed he was talented or promising enough to allow to study in the United States. It\u2019s a surprisingly difficult and rigorous process.) In exchange, international schools allow Americans to study there. The idea being that cross national communication and cross cultural education is healthy in a global market. \n\nA rising American boat while all others lower is good for us in the short term I suppose, though ultimately dangerous in terms of long term American prosperity built on global trade and production. Unless we go full isolationist, I don\u2019t see pushing America up at the expense of all other countries (especially our allies) will go over well. Unless you support a neocolonialist and post imperialistic system, forcefully keeping other countries down to benefit American business al la the 1920\u2019s Banana Wars. But that comes from the barrel of a gun, and leads nowhere good\n\nEvery American probably shouldn\u2019t go to college. That\u2019s part of the \u201cfor profit college\u201d issue you brought up later in the conversation below. I\u2019m assuming you probably want the government to provide free/heavily subsidized public higher education. But that just contributes to the same problem you seem so bent out of shape about. Namely, colleges operating not as places of learning but as a business. Government funded business is just as bad private funded business, and in many ways worse. Even then, I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s supposed to work. Would you need to apply? Is there a grade requirement? What about only certain majors being subsidized? Then how do you balance STEM and liberal arts? \n\nBesides, it makes no difference to the international student. College isn\u2019t a zero sum game, like you seem to think. One more international student doesn\u2019t equal one less college educated American. Education isn\u2019t a resource that depletes the more it is given out\n\nAmerican institutions. Funny you should mention them. With the large amount of American innovation and invention built on the back of foreign ideas and discovery, I would think it would only benefit America to allow certain promising students and intellectuals in if only temporarily. Besides, that ideal is part of our national \u201cmyth\u201d or spirit. Plenty of international students decide to stay and apply to stay in America after their visa is up anyways",

Also, to say that foreign students are here only because of their merit and not their wallet is deeply ingenious. Colleges openly admit relying on foreign students to fund their lavish operations. Do you honestly believe that the foreign student population explosion is just because they're smart? Did we just not know smart people existed outside of the US until 10 years ago?. Also, American students in foreign countries are a minuscule minority compared to foreign students in America.\n\n2. There's absolutely nothing wrong with promoting the interests of America first. No gun is needed to prevent foreign students from studying here. There are plenty of universities in other nations.\n\n3). Totally agree every American shouldn't go to college. I also don't want free or heavily subsidized college. I want colleges dedicated to learning instead of making bureaucrats rich. There is so much fat that could be trimmed, and cutting off colleges from the tit of foreign money would hasten their transformation into something similar to this vision (along with other reform with student loans, etc).\n\n4). Seats at good universities are a zero sum game. There is a non-zero amount of students who have not gotten a seat at Cal Poly (or other, \"better\" universities that take in even more foreign students). Besides, this is a demonstrably false statement:  \n\n\\&gt; Education isn\u2019t a resource that depletes the more it is given out \n\nThere are only so many teachers and seats in American higher education. It is not infinite. \n\n5). I have no argument with you here. I agree plenty of foreign ideas have contributed to America's successes. However, there's nothing stopping foreign citizens from applying for American citizenship once they have experienced some success with their idea/invention and then nurturing it here, which historically is how most of these people have done it.",

All 6 of my classes had an asynchronous option. And the international student would only have to leave if all classes are online, something that is triggered by an increase of some sort in COVID cases. That being so, if COVID cases were to spike to a point where no in person classes could be held, they shouldn't be hanging with friends nor should anyone, and if cases don't get to that point, then they can take in person classes, stay here, and hang with friends. And the lease situation affects everyone. International or not. I signed a lease too. If we go all online I'm stuck in the same situation. If we go hybrid, I'll likely live in SLO, and the international student wouldn't be forced to leave and could leave in SLO as well.",

For a lot of my friends, their registration dates have already passed and it is difficult to get an in-person class.",

If you\u2019re not moving on in the math series, a D+ may be considered a passing grade. So, if GPA doesn\u2019t matter, you could always just let it be. I\u2019d talk to an academic advisor about your situation",

Keep in mind that it can take up to a quarter for community college grades to record at cal poly, so you might need to show your enrollment to a prof of a follow on class to get a prerequisite waiver if math118 is a prerequisite for something you need to take soon.",

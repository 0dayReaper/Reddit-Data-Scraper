At a time where everyone\u2019s situation is now variable for many reasons, focus on trying your best given your situation.

Again, maybe it's just me, but I had very little time to invest in anything going on outside of my textbooks. \n\nAlso, Zoom fatigue. Why the hell do I feel so exhausted after 4 hours of zooming?  I'm not doing anything other than just sitting there watching the lectures and taking notes.",

            "comment": "This quarter I've definitely forgotten to turn in assignments and I have less motivation to study. Maybe it's because I'm at home and I fell back into my old high school habits from years ago. My upper division classes were easy and I've had Bus 214. Bus 214 had probably the biggest workload out of my five classes but was manageable. It rubbed me the wrong way how my professor acted like she cares about everyone during this pandemic but then was harsh on everyone who asked her for a little bit more leniency on some small things. Mr. Anderson and his German 103 class was super easy and chill. If anyone wants to learn German then definitely take his Ger 100 series classes even if its online next quarter. His Ger 350 class is also really entertaining. Really easy B's and A's if you do the work and spend 30 minutes a week studying.",

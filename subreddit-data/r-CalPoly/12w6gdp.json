    "postText": "Hi, I'm planning on transferring from a community college as a CS or CE major. I noticed that on [Assist.org](https://Assist.org) that a course equivalent of CSC 123 is required. I also came across an information stating that a \"community college coursework equivalent to CPE 203 ... will have credit applied to the CPE 123 requirement.\" I grabbed this information from a probably outdated and unofficial source and was wondering how true this information is for today.",

    "postText": "My friend just got his acceptance yesterday for business. I haven\u2019t gotten mine yet and my major is the same. I have a higher gpa than him (don\u2019t think that really matters) but since I haven\u2019t gotten my decision yet does that mean I won\u2019t get in since I have the same major? I know they release in batches but has the business batch already dropped or will there be another one? I\u2019m kinda stressing out now lol.",

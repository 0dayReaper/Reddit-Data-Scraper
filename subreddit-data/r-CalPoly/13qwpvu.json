I signed and initialed everything and there was an weird glitch where the Professor didn\u2019t get the email or sign it. I missed the deadline since the Professor didn\u2019t sign until after 5 pm but the next morning the dean signed it as well and went ahead with the withdrawal so you should be completely fine",

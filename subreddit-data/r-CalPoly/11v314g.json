I wouldn't go for them, they've been shitty for decades and the ownership changes and rebranding haven't helped\n\nRead https://mustangnews.net/problems-in-the-slo-apartments-remain-after-class-action-lawsuit/\n\n&gt; The case was settled in December 2018, allowing a reimbursement of up to $700,000 for the tenants who leased apartments in The SLO between Aug. 1, 2017 and July 31, 2018. Each resident received notice of the court decision along with the option to accept, exclude themselves from or object the settlement.\n\n&gt; \u201cI will tell you that as far as the code violations that were the subject of the lawsuit, most of those have been repaired,\u201d Ferrentino said. \u201cThe City of San Luis Obispo would not allow the students to move in in 2018-2019 unless the owner got the correct permits.\u201d\n\nNothing quite like losing a class action lawsuit from former tenants and allllll the code violations to make you feel all warm and fuzzy about your landlords!",

The only downside is unless youve pre-selected 3 other friends, roommates are a gamble, and I've gotten a bunch of fuckin weirdos like every year except for 1 dependable friend who agrees that everyone else we bunked with was a wackjob.",

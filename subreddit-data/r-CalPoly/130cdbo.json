    "postText": "Hi I got into slo as a computer engineering student, and am still deciding between this and ucsb. The learn by doing philosophy is very attractive to me but I\u2019m curious if any engineering students can give me the specifics on that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike what kind of things do engineering students specifically do during their time here to learn ? Is it more labs or hands on activities ? \n\nAnd if so, do other schools have less opportunities to learn by doing ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks ahead of time :)",

            "comment": "Industrial engineer here, and I think that the learn by doing is really good at poly. It's different for each major, but at least for me it's a lot of either hands on stuff, or most classes have real life applications. Even the more theoretical classes have some sort of case study and prepare you for real life situations. Even from my computer science classes were more \"real\", we had assignments that weren't like school assignments per say, more like mini-projects. Like I said before, not a comp sci major so I would definitely try talking to someone in the department. Lmk if u have any more questions",

Both are great schools with great faculty and facilities. \n\n\nLearn by doing for CPE is a combo between CS coding, CPE embedded systems, and EE circuitry labs and projects. Almost every class has a lab component that gives you the time and space to really engage with the material in a way that lets you form connections and reinforce the lecture content since you get to actually see how it works. \n\n\nAlso: our professors teach and have office hours and are very helpful in them, instead of TAs that run the classes in UCs.",

            "comment": "In you digital design classes you will be building your own RISC-V processor on an FPGA, interfacing a keyboard/mouse/monitor and running your own code. \n\n  \nAt UCD, we only got a small portion of the processor to run - and only in simulation. Not sure if that is the same experience at UCD now, nor is it reflective of what they do at UCSB. \n\nBut the driving difference is at Cal Poly, those lab classes (often integrated with \"lecture\") are run by professors who invest lots of time and energy in the whole lecture+lab experience. At UCD, you may get a professor in your lecture, but never in the lab. The end result is that the \"doing\" part at UCD felt artificial and hollow.",

    "postText": "I'm looking to sublease my room over the summer as I'm doing an internship. It's a large, private room in a 3 bedroom house walking distance to campus. There is one shared bathroom, a large living room, and a kitchen with all the standard appliances. It's less than a 10 minute walk to campus, and has a personal parking space. \n\nThis is a really good place if you're working on or near campus this summer!   You'll be sharing the house with 2 males. They're both clean, easy going and fun. You're welcome to use any/all of my furniture, including the TV, or if you're looking to get your own furniture, I can move it out. Let me know if you want to know more details, if you want more pictures, or if you want a tour of the house!  \n\nThe start and end dates are flexible, I'm very willing to work something out with you.\n\nAlso the reason this is a new account is because I don't want to dox myself on here... if you PM me I can give you a lot more details and I promise this is legit!",

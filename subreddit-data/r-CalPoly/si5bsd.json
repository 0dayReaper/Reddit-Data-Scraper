Women make up large portions of constituencies on the left and right, and many lawmakers have daughters and wives who they would presumably care about. The disconnect is that some possess the strange notion that a baby in the womb constitutes a human life, and that abortion is a euphemism for infanticide. If you don\u2019t consider fetuses living, or you consider them some discounted form of life, the argument for abortion would seem to make sense. But is this a correct way of looking at things? I think this presents a more interesting quandary for the \u201cpro-choice\u201d crowd to address: how do you arrive at a moral basis for abortion considering the nature of existence? How do you determine the worth of a human life? And to follow up, does your thesis then prove too much?",

A few parting words of advice though  \n\n\n1) resolving conflict is not always meeting in the middle. it definitely requires a mutual understanding, but sometimes one side is just straight up wrong. the way-too-far example that is easy to point to -  people who legitimately want every member of a race dead and people who do not want that. where is the middle ground there? one side is just wrong.  \n\n\n2) being a centrist is not going to make you friends. it's often just kind of annoying to everyone. as long as you are ok with that, keep going until you aren't.  \n\n\n3) I am assuming you're a cis dude, so if you aren't feel free to correct me/tell me to fuck off. you should ask the women in your life how they feel about abortion and listen to them. you can see it however you want, but cis dudes do not have the same skin in the game. at the end of the day, abortion policy affects women a whole lot more.",

Moreover, the slow but steady success that conservatives seem to be having with their long-game strategy of gaining control of statehouses and slowly chiseling away at abortion rights as well as their blatant manipulation of SCOTUS confirmation processes is terribly dispiriting for a progressive.\n\nBut none of that grants us the right to go take someone else\u2019s property. Those signs belong to _them_. The essence of ownership is that you get to decide how something is used, and _they_ own those signs. Sure, they probably cost less than $1 each. Yes, they probably took just a few minutes to make. Heck, they, _themselves_, we\u2019re probably going to throw them away after their demonstration, but that\u2019s for _them_ to decide, because it\u2019s _their_ property. Being infuriated by the inanity of their message doesn\u2019t entitle you to take it.",

I'm curious what the sign actually said though; because if it literally just said \"Pro-Life\", then I would agree if it was posted in conjunction with Cal Poly posting regulations, it was inappropriate to remove and trash it.\n\nEdit: I just pulled the reservation history in 25Live, and that space was not reserved for this demonstration per campus policy.  Since this demonstration was carried out in a manner that was not consistent with campus policy for space use, I retract my prior opinion that it was inappropriate for this student to remove the sign.  She was perfectly within her rights-in fact, she was rectifying the violation of policy enacted by the demonstrators.",

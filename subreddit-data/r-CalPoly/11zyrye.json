    "postText": "I'm an incoming junior-level transfer and I just got the acceptance email Monday. I noticed that even though the deadline to accept the offer of admission is May 1, the day the transfer housing application opens is April 6\u2014so that leaves me about 2 weeks to decide whether or not I want to go here (which I \\*really really\\* do). However, I came from a university which had a horrible housing situation (not enough on-campus housing, off-campus housing insanely expensive and impossible to find) so I'm being extremely cautious about anything involving housing. I guess my questions are:  \n\n\n1. What are my chances of getting on-campus transfer housing (Cerro Vista, Poly Canyon)?\n2. How many people go for the transfer housing? Does it fill up fast?\n3. If trying to get on-campus housing fails, how hard is it to land off-campus housing?  \n\n\nThanks!",

On the flip side, it is rare but possible to work with some top-notch researchers at UCD as an undergrad.  \n\nMy personal feeling is if you are a \"superstar\", these other schools may offer rare opportunities that are amazing. But if you are \"developing\" CP is a better fit. \n\nThese decisions are hard - and it is impossible to use your analytical brain to make the \"right\" decision. Try and take comfort in the fact that you have lots of great options, and you almost certainly will be happy with the choice you make - so go with your gut feeling :)",

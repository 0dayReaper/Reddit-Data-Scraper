    "postText": "Hi! I applied as a freshman for fall term 2023 and got in for English, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for me. I have always gotten good grades in it and because I lived in a really small school my only opportunities for AP\u2019s and Extracurricular were focused on English (Quite literally I could not take any math classes beyond Math Analysis without driving an hour to the community college)\n\n\nI am wondering if it is hard to switch into the ARCH major at Cal Poly, and if I wouldn\u2019t be able to start the major until 2nd year? \n\nOr if there are any other Engineering programs Cal Poly offers that are both good and not extremely competitive",

I was admitted into engineering and switched majors within the college and had to jump through hoops to do it. \n\nHowever, the Liberal Arts and Engineering Studies (LAES) major could be a good fit! It might be easier to get into if you haven\u2019t taken many math classes yet, and once you\u2019re in the Engineering department it will be easier to learn about different majors if you want to transfer again.",

My switch put me back 1 quarter, which was manageable.\n\nAs for getting in, afaik you need to have the grades/tests to have gotten in in the first place. If your grades and scores are below the engineering average for that particular major, it may be a lost cause. On top of that, CS and Mechanical are nearly impossible to get into compare to the others.\n\nCan you call the engineering advising office? They might be able to give you better odds and better advice than I can",

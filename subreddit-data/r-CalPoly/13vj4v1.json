    "postText": "Hello! im an incoming freshman in Computer Science but Ill be living in the Yak dorms because of the Scholars program (I think) and have two questions if you guys could help me out :)\n\n1) What is housing as an individual like? What are some experiences yall had? Any regrets or expectations I should have going in? ill admit that It was dumb of me to not look for a group :(\n\n2) I chose the cultural wow option but im sort of regretting that I did. It seems like that fewer reservations are available compared to normal wow. What are some of the pros/cons? Should I change it? can I? (For context I only chose this option since i live in an area thats composed of mainly hispanic/latino people so I wanted to slow the cultural shock feeling but now im feeling that I was exaggerating it and sort of scaring myself)",

There is a chance that the two others you will room with know each other, which is what happened to me. I talked to them about random things just to get more comfortable, cause you\u2019re gonna be with them for a year. I can pretty much get along with anyone so I don\u2019t really have any regrets.\n\n2. My experience with CCE was great. I\u2019m pretty sure you can still change, but I\u2019d stick with it. \n\nPros:\nSpend a week with other minority groups to make you feel a sense of belonging. \nGet the same \u201cfun\u201d experience (depends on what leaders have planned)\n\nCouldn\u2019t think of any cons.",

            "comment": "1. I\u2019ve been a freshman RA for three years, and the biggest expectation I\u2019ve seen is that you need to be best friends with your roommates. It\u2019s not true at all. Don\u2019t come into it expecting to be great friends. If you end up having a fantastic relationship, that\u2019s awesome! But it\u2019s much more typical to just have a civil relationship. As long as you can all respect each other, you\u2019ll get through the year. \n2. The only real difference in CCE WOW is that there is a larger focus on the cultural centers and resources on campus. The culture shock is going to happen, and if you think this is a good way to ease yourself into it then stick with it! You\u2019ll still be around all the other wowies and the people in your residence hall!\n3. Final point - where the RLCs are change every year and they\u2019re based entirely on numbers, so while there\u2019s a (decent) chance that CP Scholars will be in yak\u0294it\u02b8ut\u02b8u next year it\u2019s not a guarantee. I just don\u2019t want you being disappointed if that\u2019s the case :)",

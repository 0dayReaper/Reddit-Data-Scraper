I applied with history, both a passion and a strongsuit of mine, and I\u2019d be more than happy to stay within my college if I end up going to school here, but I\u2019m curious to see if trying classes in other colleges or even getting a double major is possible at Cal Poly. \n\nI\u2019ve seen this more in UCs than CSUs so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the norm or the exception, but is getting a double major difficult or a rare at this school, or do people end up switching or adding majors fairly often?\n\nI\u2019d love to take a couple classes in bio or architecture just to get a feel of the subject and see if I like it or not and take it from there, but some people have told me that moving to try and get majors outside your college is very difficult.  Can any students here help confirm or deny the rumours?  Thanks for the help!",

            "comment": "Majoring in History and getting a double major in Biology or Architecture would be effectively impossible. Generally, how difficult it is to double major/minor/change majors depends on how impacted the major is relative to your current major. Architecture is one of the most impacted majors at Cal Poly, you've got a 0% chance of getting classes in Architecture unless you're an Architecture major.",

            "comment": "Well I'm currently majoring in Anthropology/Geography and Agricultural and Environmental Plant Sciences (CLA and CAFES) so I feel like I may be semi suited to answer your ask. \n\nDouble majoring is definitely the exception and changing majors is relatively rare. \n\nIf you want to graduate in four years double majoring in majors from two separate colleges requires you to know exactly what classes double count, petition for classes that could double count, you should take no classes just for fun, everything must be part of a requirement. You also should be coming in with a lot of AP/dual enrollment CC classes. An upside though is that generally you'll not have as many issues getting classes to take because one of your majors will always have an open class you can enroll in. \n\nIt also gets a lot easier if one of the majors you pick has a lot of free elective credits or an choose your own concentration option because you can just use classes from the other major for that. I'm not terribly familiar with history major requirements but they should have a good chunk of free electives to work with. \n\nI would say out of the two you mentioned, architecture is literally impossible to double major in. By itself it's a 5 year degree with a mandatory study abroad and people struggle to get through in those 5 years. You can get a minor though. \n\nAs for bio I'm less familiar though I hear it's a harder major. \n\nWhat's not so rare or rigorous is getting a minor or two. With history you should be able to accomplish a minor in both architecture and bio. The reason it's a lot more attainable to do a minor is because minors usually don't include the required support courses and can be a lot more flexible.",

There are also possibilities through study abroad. However, I can't speak to how difficult it may have been to get enrolled. The course catalog can be found on the website.",

As an architecture major, architecture students can't even get into their own classes sometimes due to the school not allocating enough slots. Although Arch 217, 218, and 219 are some of the only exceptions where non-arch could take them. They are the architecture history classes which are really interesting classes with typically Don Choi teaching them. Dr. Choi is one of the greatest professors of all time.",

            "comment": "It's highly dependent on the majors you want to double major in. I was thinking about double majoring in marine science and biochemistry, and I talked to my advisor and she said that she would let all the excess biochem classes that didn't double count to count as msci electives. That's not the case for every department, and also biochem and marine science are both in CoSaM. \n\nI do know that you have to submit an ICMA to officially get a double major. People have trouble with this, especially when \"moving\" between colleges. You're usually held to course grade requirements and take a quarter or two to complete. Architecture will probably be impossible, and I don't even think they allow double majors. Biology might be doable, but it is REALLY hard to get into the intro to bio freshman courses due to how big and impacted the major is. Also, there are so many required courses in biology, you will probably have to take a fifth year to get both degrees. \n\nThere's also the challenge of getting all courses done in a timely manner. I ultimately decided just to switch to chem as a major because of how much of a pain in the ass graduating in four years would be. I had a whole plan, and if I didn't get into one class one quarter, I would have to stay an extra semester (b/c they're changing to semesters fall '26). A lot of people, even if they don't double major, end up staying an extra quarter or two because of how hard it can be to get into the classes you need. \n\nThere is the option of a bio minor if that's something you're passionate about. The history B.A. plan has plenty of units to tack on one or two minors, which might be the way to go.",

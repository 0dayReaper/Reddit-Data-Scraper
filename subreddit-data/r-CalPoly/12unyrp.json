Way way more active beach. Way way more parties. Way way more stuff to do. Way more people. Way more sports. We got sailing we got ice hockey we got snow we got desert we got multiple colleges we got places that don\u2019t all close at 8pm we got actually good Mexican food we got like 8 night life hot spots for different social vibes we have themed bars that aren\u2019t just fuckin Creeky tiki or fake cowboy frat bar bulls.\n\nSlo is podunk town full of rich kids and one of the least diverse schools in California. If you\u2019re not cool enough to get invited to a rich kid party you\u2019re gonna be bored a lot and everything in town closes early except fucking Taco Bell which will be full of screaming drunk idiots or Jack in the box which will be full of quiet drunk idiots and sketchy dudes.\n\nThe only people who think slo is a great college experience are kids with rich parents who went straight out of high school and have no frame of reference, or middle age dudes who creep on all the college girls at the bars downtown. Or people who REALLY fuckin like hiking.\n\nI went to poly purely for the aero degree and I am super happy with what I got out of it. Because I got all my \u201ccollege life\u201d experience in San Diego before I decided to go to a school for the education.\n\nBring on the downvotes yuppies",

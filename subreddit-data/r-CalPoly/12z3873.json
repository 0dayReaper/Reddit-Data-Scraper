They'll get the job done but there's nothing too special or exciting in their lectures (for context I'm a first-year so do with that what you will).",

Tbh jobs are just a matter of who you know and not what you know and you don't need to go to Cal Poly to meet the people who know. Still, the fact that we have a career fair solely dedicated to computing that companies have to pay a slot to attend and are now no longer allowed to hire students on the spot speaks a lot about the cs program here.",

[https://github.com/Kaweees/DWE\\_OS/](https://github.com/Kaweees/DWE_OS/). My advice is to form connections with recruiters because if you can sell to them you are competent enough to hire that'll get you the door into the interview stage. Most first-year apps are tossed out because of not taking freshies seriously based on the impression the people at the career fairs gave me this year.",

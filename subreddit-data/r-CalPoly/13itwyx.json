    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all,\n\nI am an incoming transfer student for next fall and am curious about the dining situation at Cal Poly. For context I have severe food allergies to a few of the top 8 allergens. I am well prepared to cook a lot of my own food but some days eating out is much more convenient. I have already submitted my application for OSD accommodations as well. I\u2019ve also read something about Balance Cafe but couldn\u2019t find much info. Any stories or tips are greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "I haven't used dining recently but they were always pretty cautious when I ate there. Things on the menus were labelled for allergens. At the buffet there was a section of all allergen free food separate from the main buffet line. A lot of restaurants had the panda express style register where there are buckets of food next to each other to get loaded into meal boxes/onto plates, so most of those would probably be out for you. The biggest issue would be variety because the selection is not that big compared to UC dining (I know Berkeley, Santa Barbara and UCLA have bigger selection). When whatever buffet place opens up in the new dining complex that will probably double the allergen-free options, but I don't remember when that is coming",

I know the UCs though got lots of money to afford all the facilities and nutritionist to help out with this. Not expecting it to be on par with UCs but at least a decent level of cleanliness or organisation will go a long way with me.",

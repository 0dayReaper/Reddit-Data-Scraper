            "comment": "TRIO is basically a student support service group. Similar to Cal Poly Scholars, they provide a variety of resources, opportunities, and aids for students such as in forms of community and life-skill events and scholarships (only 2 total though). UNIV 100 is not tedious at all (one unit class); if you get the TRIO version, it's basically one paragraph/essay a week on what you learned that week. There's also like a CP Scholars version that seemed to be a lot more work than the TRIO one (referencing of a friend's experience with having to actually read a book for this class). It's only an hour of class each week and you go through a variety of helpful topics from financial aid, study abroad, and investing. It's more of like a \"tip toe\" in these topics due to the short class frame. Furthermore, there are also extra credit opportunities in case you forgot to do an assignment. In my opinion, it was not a hassle as a first year already taking 15 credits.",

We have these amazing opportunities with barbecue cook outs, quartet field trips to really nice locations (going to camp at Yosemite this quarter (we don\u2019t pay TRIO does)) we went to LA for grad school info and got to go to Santa Monica. Trips change every year but they are always great trips. My mentor we are more friends than we are of a scholar to mentor type relationship. It\u2019s honestly really cool! All the people in Trio are really chill :) UNIV 100 was just a weekly summary and there is extra credit opportunities all for 1 unit so it\u2019s great!",

Im guessing I could still apply since they invited me but aren\u2019t there 2 different RLCs for them? Would Scholars and TRIO be too much to handle?",

They both have their pros and cons, but I definitely enjoyed the community of TRIO much better. The relationship that I found in TRIO is just more close-knitted as the group is a lot smaller than that of Scholars. As part of these programs, you have to attend a certain number of events per quarter/year.   \n\n\nScholars: 3 CP Scholars hosted events per year or be paired with a Scholar Mentor and attend 1 event per quarter [More Info Here](https://scholars.calpoly.edu/scholar-expectations-2021-222)  \n\n\nTRIO: attend 2 TRIO hosted events AND 4 meetings with mentor  \n\n\nJust a FYI, if you requested a mentor for both, they will just give you a TRIO mentor due to large amounts of CP Scholars.   \n\n\nIn terms of RCL, I ended up in the TRIO RLC; it seemed like TRIO overrides Scholars, but at least for this year, both RLC are located in Yakitutu.",

            "comment": "There\u2019s a decent amount of climbing for our small town. There are multiple areas around Bishop Peak. Most roped climbs are sport. Most popular with a good amount of routes is Cracked Wall. There is also Shadow Wall, P Wall (some trad), and some climbing near the summit blocks (among other areas, these were just my favorite areas). Do be aware that the bolting, especially on Cracked Wall, is more traditional and not for beginner leaders. Bishop Peak also has some bouldering (Pete and Clarissa are the most visible from the summit trail up). If you are interested in multi pitch, the Tecate challenge is a contrived multi pitch up to the summit and a fun outing. \n\nThere is also climbing at Cerro Cabrillo, also sport. I find those climbs to be more beginner friendly especially on lead, but the rock isn\u2019t as good quality as Bishop in my opinion. \n\nDefinitely recommend downloading mountain project to get a lay of the land. Happy climbing and be safe!",

    "postText": "Hi! So i am interested in cal poly and am one of the top students at my high school. I have reviewed the selection criteria but one grey area is if ap courses matter to them besides gpa. Obviously, they add honor points but only up to eight, so my CSU gpa is only 4.11 (not super good especially for the engineering college) my gpa would be higher if i had simply taken less classes, which is just weird because you think they would reward those who took on lots of responsibilities (my gpa if every ap is weighted is 4.4) basically, are they going to look and see that the class title is AP and like that, or does someone with 8 semesters of AP have the same chance as someone who\u2019s taken &gt;20 semesters worth of AP classes.\nHope this made sense, thanks!",

            "comment": "Here's the [official guidelines](https://www.calpoly.edu/admissions/first-year-student/selection-criteria) they give.\n\nWhile they limit the number of weighted classes, they're still considering your overall coursework, so someone with a more strenuous course load wouldn't necessarily lose out to someone with far fewer advanced courses. \n\nExtracurriculars and work experience also are pretty valuable: GPA is one part, sure, but getting some B's while participating in clubs and working/volunteering helps moreso, IMO.\n\nThe main value of AP courses, in my opinion, is exempting yourself from classes if you pass the AP test. Saved thousands of dollars doing that.\n\nGood luck!",

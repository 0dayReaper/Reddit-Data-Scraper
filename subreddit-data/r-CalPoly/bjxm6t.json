            "comment": "Hi u/MagneticDipoleMoment, the Cal Poly administration regrets to inform you that the logo you have submitted is too professional and would scare away potential ~~customers~~ students. We were looking for something that garners less respect and is far more costly to produce. This logo also does not have any crossed tools on it and does not have **LEARN BY DOING** written on it in a bold font, so it does not present our brand as the *prestigious* university that Cal Poly is.\n\nThe administration will consider your logo proposal if the grievances above are addressed.",

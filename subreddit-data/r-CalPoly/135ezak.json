Second, I\u2019m looking for female housemates only. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a roommate to fill the third spot in the lease for the 2bed/2bath + loft townhouse I\u2019m currently in. The available space is a third floor loft that is definitely large enough to share if you have someone and want to cut back on rent. \n\nIt\u2019s a YEAR LEASE starting July 1st. \n\nThe rent for the loft for one person is $1200/mo. and utilities (not included in rent) range from around $90-$120 (normally comes out around $100). For two people, the loft would be $725 EACH and utilities would come out to about the same ($90-$120), most likely, each per month. \n\nIt\u2019s in a very cute complex next to the freeway so it\u2019s about a 5-7 min drive to cal poly and about a 12min drive to cuesta. There\u2019s an in unit washer/dryer and a dishwasher. Everyone in the complex is very friendly and it overall is pretty quiet. \n\nA little bit about me: I\u2019m (20f) going to be a fourth year at cuesta and I\u2019m switching from architectural engineering to architecture rn. I am on the quiet side and tend to keep to myself. I would prefer someone who is also on the quiet/more studious side. I\u2019m not a party person. If you want to have people over I would never tell you no but letting me know first would be hugely appreciated. I like to read and play music and hike if I have time. \n\nThe other girl is a third year business transfer to cal poly. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re at cuesta or poly!! I\u2019d prefer someone LGBTQ+ friendly and also mental health aware. \n\nPlease dm me if you\u2019re interested with a little about yourself and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can! Also, if you have an Instagram you can send that and I\u2019ll follow you so we can chat on there!\n\nThanks :)",

    "postText": "So, I'm walking on Dexter Lawn yesterday, minding my own business (nice day, 75 degrees, blue sky), in a rush to get a Boba Tea to cool down, and I walk by a booth (can't remember what it was, likely a Republican thing) and some guy says: \"The US blew up Nordstream 2 pipeline.\" \n\nI got so angry, why would someone say that? I personally know that explosion was the single largest release of Methane in the history of the world, and I CARE about the environment! We all know that the Russians blew up the pipeline they spent 11 billion dollars to build just to get back at us! Duh!\n\nHearing that guy say that nonsense outraged me, because we all know the Russians blew up the pipeline they built. The guy at the booth (he had a very annoying, smug-looking face for the record) then said something to the effect of \"Seymour Hersch proved that it was the US, with help of Norway who were behind it.\"\n\nSeymour Hersch? Who is this pro-Kremlin blogger anyway? I looked into him and turns out the guy supposedly broke the story on the My-Lai Massacre in Vietnam, Watergate, Abu Ghraib, the staged Syrian Chemical attacks blamed on Assad blah, blah blah, this guy clearly hates America!! \n\nSure, he's allegedly one of \"the most famous and respected journalist in American history\" \\*(according to who exactly? Putin?) but something doesn't add up here. Why would Europe want energy independence from US Liquid Natural Gas supplies increasing the economic relationship between Europe's largest manufacturing economy that relies on cheap gas to turn a profit and the main supplier in the region? It doesn't add up!!\n\nIt makes me so angry when so-called \"journalists\" (who is fact-checking them again?) say things that completely destroy what I have been told on the television and newspapers daily! Why would that guy in the booth say something like that and destroy what had been a sunny day full of non-conflicting thoughts for me?!\n\nWhy on Earth would WE the US blow up a pipeline and cause the largest release of Methane in the history of the world when we all know Global Warming is such a serious problem? Not adding up. We are the good guys, and that's one of the worst Greenhouse gases you can possibly release.Germany is our ally.  It does not add up.\n\nI was so angry, the only thing I could do was go back to my room, turn off the lights and turned on CNN and NPR at the same time in different AirPods. The voice of Judy Woodruff is the only thing that can calm me down after a violent interaction like that. \n\nI can't believe views like that are even allowed on a college campuses!  Hearing other people's opinions that are wrong isn't why we have universities.  Too bad we can't just ban these types of people when they're spewing their lies in public like we can on the internet.",

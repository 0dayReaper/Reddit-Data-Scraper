And then I graduated having made literally zero friends. I stayed in slo and got a part time job, and then the whole staff quit about 3 months in and I wound up working alone there too. And I\u2019ve lived alone the whole time. Life\u2019s going GREAT lol.",

Keep ones that you know will stick around near and the other ones I just have on snapchat and we both see what's going on with each other, never saying anything lol",

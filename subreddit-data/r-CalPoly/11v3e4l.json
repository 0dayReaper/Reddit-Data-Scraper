    "postText": "I'm a second year going for the computer science minor. I'm just finishing 203 and now realized I took csc101 credit/no credit. I got an 88. Is there any way I can appeal the minor requirement for taking the class c/nc? If you count the b+ I have a 3.66 average in the 3 classes. Thanks, let me know what you suggest I do.",

Nobody can verify that the grade would have been a B+ (not everybody will assign a B+ for an 88) without it appearing on the transcript. You may be able to petition to switch the grade from cr/nc to letter grading.",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI am an incoming freshman going into mechanical engineering and I was wondering about the requirements for laptop at Cal Poly. I currently have a strong (12900k + 3080) pc and was wondering if it would be a good idea to buy a windows laptop or decide on something more versatile such as an iPad Pro.\n\nAre SolidWorks and other intensive programs such as Ansys, MatLab, etc. used in class or just outside of class? If programs such as this are used in class then a strong windows laptop would be necessary.\n\nAny other advice, concerns, or recommendations are greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Yep, I totally concur with rhinguin. PC laptop and iPad with lots of memory is a winning combination for MEs. Laptop is super important for in class or in lab work, research, and assignments. Once you get here there\u2019s a software hub for you to download all necessary S/W for free. SolidWorks, HSMWorks, MatLab, Simulink and Microsoft suite, etc\u2026 all available for your use while here. ALL IN CLASSROOM ME COMPUTERS AND PRINTERS ARE GOING AWAY this summer. \n\nYour iPad will be super important for writing/taking notes during class on ppt slides from Canvas, and your collection of PDFs of your text books for reading and reference, and homework problems. Don\u2019t buy textbooks unless your syllabus/professor say you have to. You can buy them later if you want to keep them for you reference library, but VERY FEW texts will be worth it. \n\nGood luck!",

It sucks that the old machines are going away, but you can literally do solidworks on a chromebook-level notebook since the program can run on a remote machine. My senior project partner literally did solidworks from his ipad.",

I had a Mac and it did not work for ME (on the other hand, for any CS majors reading this.. get a Mac for CS).  Having a PC is ideal for working on parts outside of class, which you do have.  \n\n\nAs for a laptop vs an iPad\u2026 I personally do have an iPad Pro for notes and I love it, but I would probably prioritize getting a decent windows laptop first and maybe getting an iPad further down the line.",

It's slightly less convenient than using your own machine, but at least to start I wouldn't drop another dime until you get a feel for what you wished you had.\n\nOne of my senior project partners did the CAD for our senior project through their ipad using the virtual desktop. You literally can't go wrong with what device you bring.\n\nDon't waste your money. Come get a feel for what you'd like (virtual notetaking device, personal computer that is strong enough for CAD, etc) and then go from there.",

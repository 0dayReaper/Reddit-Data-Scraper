    "postText": "I\u2019m looking for advice on which rlc I should choose in my housing application. I\u2019m in the college of science and math, but I don\u2019t necessarily want to be surrounded by a bunch of people in my major. I feel like my only option is the leadership rlc, but the leadership rlc says it has 8-week fall course work required which I don\u2019t want to do, especially if it\u2019s gonna be time consuming. How important is your rlc to your experience, and which one do you guys recommend I select?",

            "comment": "I specifically didn't choose my major rlc so I could get to know more people, but looking back that was a big mistake. You're really going to be spending a ton of time in class and studying with these people, so it's just better to live close to them too. I didn't get to meet that many more people by not choosing a major RLC because clubs and GEs are way better for that. The problem I saw is that it just divides your time too much if you have different groups in classes, clubs etc, and housing while actually doing all those things. It's more worth it to invest in the people you find that you really get along with. I definitely felt at a disadvantage making friends in my major by not living in the same building complex as them and it took a few years of group projects and studying together to feel that distance abate all the way. If you really like a certain RLC that's best, but I did what you're thinking (doing a random small RLC to avoid major RLC) and I think major RLC seems like the move unless you're just that extroverted that you need to see as many unique faces as possible",

            "comment": "You can choose any of the college RLCs without being in that college, and that can be interesting especially if you already have roommate(s) you want to live with who are in a different college, but as mentioned above living with your college is often really helpful when it comes to forming study groups, etc. And, it won\u2019t all be people from your major! In the COSAM RLC you have people from all science and math majors so there\u2019s a really good range of interests and majors",

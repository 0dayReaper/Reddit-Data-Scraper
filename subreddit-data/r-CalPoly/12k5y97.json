    "postText": "Hi, I'm looking for someone to sublease my room this July through December! I'm flexible with the dates and furnishing: I'm willing to sublease just over either the summer or fall (although ideally both), and I'm able to leave or take my bed and desk and other furnishings. The house is in a great location: 20 mins walk/ 5 min bike/ 5 min drive from campus. DM or comment if you're interested or have questions!",

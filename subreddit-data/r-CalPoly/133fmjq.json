    "postText": "Hello my fellow neurodivergents! \n\n**TLDR: DON'T make the same mistake I did and go to Dr. Michael Selby at Affordable Learning Disability Evaluations.** \n\nI, unfortunately, have a warning based on a really negative experience I just had and wanted to share it with others so they hopefully don't make the same mistake. \n\nI received a grant to help pay for a learning disability evaluation recently. I connected with Dr. Michael Selby at Affordable Learning Disability Evaluations based on the recommendation of Cal Poly counseling services. \n\nUpon completing my appointment with him, I felt extremely defeated and had a higher negative self-view. I immediately got a bad feeling about the competence of this evaluation. Dr. Selby is in his late 70s, possibly early 80s. He refused to let me explain why I was there or share my history of trying to get an ADHD diagnosis. He consistently refused to let me explain myself more, and immediately after I shared what little I could, he told me, \u201cI don\u2019t even know why you\u2019re here.\u201d As I tried to tell him more of my history and told him that I was seeing Cal Poly Counseling services, he told me, \u201cYou need to go see someone else. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing over there, but they don\u2019t know anything.\u201d He echoed this sentiment multiple times throughout the testing, constantly bad-mouthing Cal Poly\u2019s services. He claimed he knew more than them based on his Masters in pharmacology. \n\nThroughout three hours of testing using the WAIS-IV, he refused to let me talk unless it was what we were working on. He was brash, rude, and inconsiderate. Whenever I answered a question incorrectly or didn\u2019t know something, he immediately told me it was wrong in an antagonizing manner.  He was consistently disengaged from what we were doing, even taking a personal phone call during the evaluation with me in the room (In the phone call, he mentioned he was recovering from a car accident and taking injections of painkillers, but the doctors would no longer give him anymore) and often leaving to fetch things like his glasses or hearing aid. I feel like my concerns were not properly communicated as he constantly kept saying he didn\u2019t see signs of ADHD or why I was there. He consistently made me feel like I was stupid or wasting his time. \n\nThough I don\u2019t question his previous experience in his more present days, I highly doubt his ability to evaluate more modern matters and his care towards his patients. I would strongly urge that his contact information is removed from all Cal Poly counseling platforms, as he clearly has no respect for Cal Poly or his patients. I did not pay him because he expressed that I could pay when I came back to discuss the results, but in all honesty, I don\u2019t want to go back, and I am hesitant to give him such large quantities of money. At this point, I feel I have exhausted my resources and don\u2019t know where else to turn. I continue to face debilitating ADHD symptoms that severely affect my well-being, and it seems like I can\u2019t get others to understand the challenges I have been facing for years.",

If you live in san luis obispo or santa barbara, then your enrollment with medi-cal automatically becomes [cen cal insurance.](https://www.cencalhealth.org/) Cen cal will enable you to access a wide range of medical providers on the central coast- including psychiatric care providers. It's honestly an amazing service provided through your taxpayer dollars.\n\nPM me if you have questions on how to enroll; it's such a complicated process, but there are options out there and having health insurance is very, very valuable.",

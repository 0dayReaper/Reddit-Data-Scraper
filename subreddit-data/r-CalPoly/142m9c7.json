I don\u2019t know any poly students but live in SLO and pretty much everyone I know has been sick lately with coughing being the main symptom. It\u2019s not covid though.\n\nAs someone pointed out, it might be that allergies are worse this season with all the blooms and such. My coughing is stemming from post nasal drip and my eyes get heavily irritated when I step outside.",

Others not at cal poly are not going through the stresses of finals and such, and are still heavily impacted by this virus. It\u2019s just a rampant virus hitting everyone and I am curious to know what it is.",

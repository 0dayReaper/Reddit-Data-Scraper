Boosting GPA for grad school maybe, but a C wouldn\u2019t affect you too much\u2026unless you get a ton of C\u2019s\u2014then retaking one wouldn\u2019t do too much either.",

You may think the advantage of approaching this material for the second time will help you, but instead what will happen is that when your other difficult classes start to suck up your time, this is the class you will neglect.\n\nYou know the concepts now. You'll have plenty of time to practice and build on them in the upper division classes. Have the mental fortitude to accept the ego hit that a C- on your transcript will give you and move on. There are much bigger factors that will affect your overall career path than a C- in your 200-level college Dynamics class.",

C/C- is about average, since there\u2019s little grade inflation for that class.\n\nIf it\u2019s structured the same as when I took it as well, there will also be a small curve.",

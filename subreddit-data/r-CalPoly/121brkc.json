    "postText": "I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of questions lately asking about whether if you will get accepted, whether or not if you will get in to a major and etc. \n\nTo be honest, speaking as an ambassador, you won\u2019t find the accurate answers here!! We as current students can only speak from our experiences, but admissions changes every year, we do not know how they work and how they determine a student\u2019s qualifications!!! Not to mention about waves, we do not know any info about that! You might get the wrong info from us which in turn can make your more nervous and stressed.\n\nI would recommend you to relax and focus on current classes, maintain good grades and enjoy senior year no matter the outcome!\n\nIf you are really desperate, please go to the acceptance mega thread and ask other current prospective students. \n\nThanks",

You will make the most of whatever your next choice is, you will get a great education, and you will go far. Getting into Cal Poly isn\u2019t the end all/be all. The truth is, regardless of your major, you will have done great classes and some crappy ones and that happens at any school and you will be fine.\n\nI didn\u2019t get into my dream school or my #2, so I wasn\u2019t super excited about coming to cal Poly. But I made the most of it and I really like it and the disappointment of not going to my dream school is just a faded memory.I had a great college experience.  You will too, wherever you go!",

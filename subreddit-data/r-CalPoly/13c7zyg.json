    "postText": "I\u2019m a senior (21F) on my last year and is looking for housing for 2023-2024 school year. How difficult is it to sublease a room that\u2019s partially/ fully furnished with transit options to campus (walkable distance)??\n\nMy budget is around 1k and i have been actively searching on Facebook pages but most of them are summer subleases. Will there be more options closer towards fall quarter or should I settle with a room on fb?",

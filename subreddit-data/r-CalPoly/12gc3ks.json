It's also worth noting that the department is incredibly impacted, so it seems dangerously optimistic to me to presume you're going to actually be able to enroll in enough major courses each quarter to make that happen. I think it can be worth it to graduate a quarter or 2 early, but a full year would reduce the number of summer internships on your resume, which could hurt you when you're job hunting after your graduate",

Some of your college friends may be lifelong friends\n* Don't forget to enjoy being a college student as well. \n\nNo need to rush through with your degree only to join industry.  Industry will wait (unless we are all replaced by AI overlords). \n\nOf course, if you have an exciting vision for your future - do that!.",

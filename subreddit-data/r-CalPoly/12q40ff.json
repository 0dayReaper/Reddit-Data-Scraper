    "postText": "A bit of a repost. \n\nI have a place. I also have 2 cats. I have one girl who is an incoming transfer to poly. I\u2019m at cuesta. \n\nHi, I\u2019m (20f) looking for one female roommate to move into the remaining bedroom in my current place. I\u2019m looking here bc I\u2019ve had not fantastic results on the Facebook group (we were just really different people and lived very different lifestyles) and I kinda thought maybe if you\u2019re on Reddit you\u2019re not quite so\u2026extroverted. I\u2019m at cuesta and it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re at poly or cuesta. \n\nI live in a 2 bed 2 bath townhouse that has a pretty big loft on the third story. The available space is a bedroom on the second floor and I\u2019m in the bedroom next door. It\u2019s a 12 min drive to cuesta and like 5 mins to poly. It\u2019s really cute and the rent isn\u2019t horrible considering it\u2019s on the nicer side. I\u2019m honestly not 100% sure how much it would be though as my current lease is not the rent I\u2019d pay next year but it would be around $1000-1100 each for rent (it should be less) and about $120~ each for utilities (that\u2019s the absolute max I\u2019ve paid this year, it\u2019s normally lower). As the loft is significantly larger than the other two rooms, the girl up there will pay more. But with this being Reddit, I don\u2019t really want to say too much else. \n\nMessage me if you\u2019re interested with your insta if you have one or at least a little bio. \n\nI\u2019m an architectural engineering, maybe architecture, major, current third year, and I appreciate personal space. I try to keep shared spaces clean. Potential roommate is preferably LGBTQ+ friendly and mental health aware. I am pretty focused on school and I am pretty busy with my major and I would prefer roommates who are along the same lines or at least understand that. I\u2019m by no means going to stop you from having people over, but I would super appreciate a heads up first. \n\nI need to have another roommate by the end of the week so please contact asap and I can answer any questions you have! \n\nThanks.",

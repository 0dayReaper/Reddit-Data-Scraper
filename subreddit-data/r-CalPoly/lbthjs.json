It\u2019s not a complete 30 day deactivation for mfa. \nOne of the big security risks for Cal Poly accounts is phishing attempts. If you get phished, the attacker would still have to get past the mfa wall. I bet they currently have the numbers to support the fact that remembered devices getting compromised makes up a small enough amount of cases to make the 12 hour limit no longer worth it",

An attacker would still need your password if they stole your authorized device (or browser profile). You still have to enter your password every 30(?) minutes. 2FA is used to prevent attackers who have your password from gaining access on their unauthorized device. The first factor (something you know, i.e. your password) works just like it always has\u2014 but the second factor (something you have, i.e. your device) is your authorized device itself. Entering the 2FA key simply transfers the \"something you own\" from your smartphone to your device that's running the browser. Now *that* device becomes the \"something you own\" instead of your phone. Requiring that every 12 hours doesn't appreciably improve security because you still own your phone *and* authorized device, and if that \"something you own\" gets stolen, you are still protected by the \"something you know\". But in fact, by normalizing the activity of accepting the push notifications on such a frequent basis to the point where it becomes habitual, it runs the risk that an attacker may log in with a stolen password and request the Duo push notification and, out of habit, some users may actually authorize it (perhaps thinking it's a bug, or accidentally hitting Accept instead of Deny out of muscle memory). Convenience in itself is actually an important factor in security, because inconvenience results in security-defeating complacency.",

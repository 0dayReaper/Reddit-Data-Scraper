    "postText": "extremely specific and silly question but...\n\nIf I were to take CSC 365 in the fall with Lucas Pierce, what are my chances of doing well in the class if I skipped class on Wednesdays? AKA does he take attendance, is lab required everyday, does he post his lectures, when does he hold his midterms/quizzes, could I sit in his earlier section, etc etc...I just have another commitment on Wednesdays at the same time his class is so I was wondering if I'd be able to get away with skipping class",

            "comment": "You should just email him and ask or go to his office hours and ask, present your case as to why you need to miss Wednesdays and ask about his attendance policy. But don\u2019t be surprised if he says it\u2019s not a good idea. 365 is a pretty intense class if you don\u2019t already feel comfortable with SQL. It can be intense even if you do use basic SQL regularly",

With 365, my experience over many years of teaching it is that while attendance varies, students who routinely missing classes don't wind up doing as well on exams as they would have had they attended. My view frustum is narrow, and Lucas Pierce teaches differently, but the material is the same.",

    "postText": "So, I\u2019ve never used these services in my life as I know it means normally a marked up menu, and then the expectation to tip (bribe) someone to bring you food. No thanks.   (ANd the restaurant loses a part in fees).   As the brother of a pizza shop (owner) who got screwed over with these apps, I have had no reason to use them.\n\nSo, is there a special way to use it on campus that makes it worthwhile?   If I just want to order ahead on campus, are the prices marked up?   98% of the time, I just want to place my order and pick it up, like starbucks mobile.   \n\nHow does it work (if it does) with dining dollars?\n\nAnd if I am feeling lousy/sick, for that rare exception, do they deliver to the dorms?   \n\nI wish there had been a dining presentaion at open house.   I had lots of questions.",

            "comment": "So for on-campus dining, there is no delivery at all. You can only pick up food. You use dining dollars for on-campus dining on GrubHub. \n\nYou will probably use grubhub for most of your orders, because ordering in person takes a lot longer and more effort. And some places don't even accept in person ordering.\n\nIf you're sick and want delivery, you have to order off-campus with real money.",

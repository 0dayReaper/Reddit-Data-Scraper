    "postText": "Hi I'm planning to go to Cal poly as a stats major and minor in data science. Was just wondering how people have liked it that have done something similar and also how getting classes are. I've mostly heard positive things about the stats major and data science minor but heard a few bad things too. Thanks!",

            "comment": "To follow up on what u/rhinguin said....  The program is called \"Cross-Disciplinary Studies Minor\", and although, these days I am the only person who insists on  using the full name or the \"CDSM\" acronym instead for the more colloquial \"minor\", it is important for those looking into this program to understand the differences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCDSMs are a unique-to-Cal Poly thing (we have several of them now) we designed to address a very specific situation: additional education in a field/area adjacent to one's discipline, but benefiting from an exposure to another discipline. In the context of Data Science - as a discipline it lies in the intersection of Computer Science and Statistics, with some Math thrown into the mix for good measure, which is the primary targets for this program at the outset were CS and Statistics majors, and the extended list of majors that can embed this program into their studies \\*at the cost that is equal to a cost of a regular minor\\* includes Software Engineering, CPE and Mathematics.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCDSM in Data Science works roughly as follows. It is a preset list of courses. From outside, this list (around 20 classes, or around 80 units) looks daunting.  But, if you are a Statistics major, all but around 12-15 (I should remember the exact number, but I don't) units of those 80 are part of the BS in Stat coursework.  Some of those courses are just outright major requirements (e.g. STAT 302, or STAT 331). Some wind up being technical electives (e.g., some of the CSC courses from the list).   Same thing happens to CS majors - they have about 17-19 units above and beyond the major that this program costs them. What's different how the courses count. For Stat majors CSC 202 and CSC 203 are electives and STAT 331 and STAT 305 are required. For CS majors, it is reversed.\n\nThe important part though is - those details are important to us (faculty) to make sure the program works and a student can graduate.  From outside it \\*does\\* look like a student is taking an equivalent of an actual minor in addition to their BS degree. \n\nSince I am not a student I cannot vouch for individual experiences in the program. We try to make it interesting, relevant, and fun, and we try to produce immediately employable junior data scientists for both large companies and startups. \n\nWhat I \\*will\\* acknowledge is this. Once you are officially part of the program (this happens once you have taken DATA 301, got a B- or higher in it and submitted an application), we have the ability to track you, and ensure that you get into the courses you need. Sometimes (like this upcoming quarter), we have to scrape, and sometimes courses get scheduled in a way that a required STAT course conflicts with the only section of a required CSC course - and we have to deal with the fallout. But once you are junior and are on the \"inside\" - we try to get everyone through the coursework.\n\nWhere things are more difficult, and this especially concerns non-CS/SE/CPE majors is with those second year CS coursework.  STAT and MATH students require CSC 101, so everyone will take it at the right time (usually Spring of freshman year, sometimes - Fall of sophomore year).  To get into DATA 301, you also need at least CSC 202 (Fundamentals of CS II: Data Structures) . That class is currently operating as an effective bottleneck due to the department's teaching resources being stretched thin.  Statistics faculty supervising this program do a good job of reaching out to students for their course needs, and thus far we've been able to get students into CSC 202, but it has been a concerted effort, and if an individual student got left out of it, it was hard to get that course.   So, I'd be lying if I said \"you can easily get into any course in the program\", but I \\*\\*wouldn't be lying\\*\\* if I said \"So far, we've managed to get the vast majority of students who wanted to be in the program into the right courses\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps. Sorry for the wall of text.",

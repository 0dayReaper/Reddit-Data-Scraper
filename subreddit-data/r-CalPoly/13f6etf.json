We will see if they met numbers after this weekend.",

If UCLA didn't hit their #s since they have been using waitlist since mid-april and still had to pull a big # of waitlist again last weekend, I believe that others haven't hit there #s. UCLA will create openings at other UCs.",

Obviously, that would be the right thing to do, but filling those spots might not happen immediately if some students take their time in letting Cal Poly SLO know. Is that right?",

Some on college confidential have SIRed at 1 UC and then got off waitlist at another UC and SIRed again. They claim to be waiting for housing confirmation. If they hold on too long UCOP has a centralized database and they know. Someone said they SIRed at Cal Poly and now got into UCLA. They can hold these spots and play stupid until they are sure.",

My husband was offered deferred admission to Spring term 30 years ago to Cal. He didn\u2019t want to start school late and decided to go to Boston College for undergrad. I graduated Cal Poly early after 3 years to be with him and he went to Stanford for a masters at the same time he was offered admissions to USC for law school. USC wouldn\u2019t allow him to defer admissions so then after graduate school he went to UW for law school. I didn\u2019t adjust well to Seattle or the weather and then he transferred after one year of law school at UCLA. I am a firm believer the road might not be straight but everyone mostly ends up at where they are meant to be \u2026",

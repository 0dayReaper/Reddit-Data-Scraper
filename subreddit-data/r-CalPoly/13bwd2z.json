            "comment": "It felt pretty even to me. As you get further along your degree path you can kind of branch out and choose your own path whether you like EE or CS more. \n\nThere are many learn by doing projects depending on the class. Lab classes might have a final lab or final project where you can implement what you\u2019ve learned throughout the quarter. Almost all classes for EE classes were in a lab setting where you\u2019re working with circuits and instruments. CS labs are computer labs where you\u2019re programming. \n\nThe classes that felt most learn by doing for me were embedded systems, the capstone project and the senior project. Really cool stuff!",

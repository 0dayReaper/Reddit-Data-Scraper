    "postText": "For those of you unaware, we have recently begun the free stuff season!\n\nThis is the time of year when leases end and people don't want to cart whatever crap with them to wherever they are going. It's all on the curb and very very free. \n\nIf you are going to be newly leasing an apartment off campus next year, this is a great time to snag free fans, desk chairs, matresses, and miscellaneous furniture. Doing so will save you the money of buying it all new. \n\nThe best part of this season is from now till late july. By the time September comes around there is less stuff being put out and more people searching. \n\n**For those of you moving out,** if there is anything you don't want to move, place it on the curb in an area that is plainly visible driving by, the best areas are typically red curb zones because no one parks there. Even if you don't think someone could want it, perhaps someone will and you'll end up contributing less to furniture waste. Though if you want your crap to have the best chance of being a treasure for someone else, don't place it with stuff that's been there for over a week or two, trashtrucks usually roam around collecting the large furniture that's been there too long. Last year I put a desk out because I snagged a better one and the entire pile was gone by the end of the day because a trash truck came by. \n\n**For those of you on campus or willing to go to campus**, PCV and Cerro is about to (if they haven't already) put out the giant trash buckets. I've seen so, so, many appliances go in those things, working mini fridges, kurigs, tvs, computers, etc. If you live in PC or Cero and don't want anything and it's not broken or unusable, leave it next to the dumpsters or give it to the goodwill truck that's always parked in PCV this time of year. This includes plastic tote buckets, and the remaining half of your palet of Starbucks drinks (ok maybe goodwill won't take the food items but if you've ever bummed a ride off an upperclassman they probably will)",

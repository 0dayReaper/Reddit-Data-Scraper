    "postText": "Hello Everyone! I'm a first year student here at cal poly and will be living in PCV next year. I'm in a group of 3 people for my roommate group, and we already chose our apartment. Sadly, there were only 6 person apartments available, which means I will have a roommate again. I'm wondering if there is a way to see who else joins the apartment so that I can start scouting out possible roommates ASAP so I can get a good match. My current roommate is horrible and I don't want to have another situation like the one I'm in right now. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

From the 6 person apartment, those are normally two individual rooms and two doubles, so are you sure you're even the one who gets a roommate?",

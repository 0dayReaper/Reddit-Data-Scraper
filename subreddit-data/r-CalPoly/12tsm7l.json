    "postText": "Hi I'm an incoming freshman and I was wondering if anyone could explain a bit on the whole cal poly scholar and honors dorm thing (I looked it up a bit but it's still a little confusing). If I accept the scholar program offer, does that basically mean that my dorm preferences don't matter when I apply? what happens if you are both a cp scholar and under the honors program?\n\nalso I am in need of advice for housing/rooming first year. I've looked across a bunch of websites/social media pages like the 2027 freshman instagram page for roommates but it's kind of overwhelming (and they all seem very extraverted which is a bit daunting). this sounds like a really dumb question but how and where can you suggest someone if they'd like to be roommates?",

The apartments are Cedar Creek. I will be a transfer student this fall and want to make the best choices budget wise. Should opt in for trying to rent a room from someone or stick with the apartment? I know housing is a pain to deal with here so I need some help and perspective.",

The size if the rooms matters a lot because the best way to save money is to pack in the roommates rather than get a cheaper but amaller house. You could find a better deal, but the quality of the apartment would likely drop off pretty fast based on my struggles finding housing in January",

    "postText": "My family and I can\u2019t attend all 3 days of Open House, and can only make it on Friday. Is it possible to attend Friday? We are 3 hours from the campus though, and I noticed checkin is at like 8 AM and I don\u2019t know if we can make it. \n\nWorst case, should I just come it on a self guided campus tour? i really wanted to attend open house, but the timings and 3-day thing is not working out. \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Last year I only went on Friday, and it was fine. Honestly, the only thing you really do is show up, go to the speech, and get the tour for your major. It's not necessarily something that important. It is good to see if you want to go to that major.",

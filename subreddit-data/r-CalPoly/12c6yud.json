Sounds about right.\n\nArmstrong brings in millions of dollars to the university, allowing for massive expansions in student housing and university facilities to be done without increasing tuition costs.\n\nThe average professor teaches a few classes to a few dozen students.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to like Armstrong, but the man is clearly brilliant at one thing (if only one thing): generating millions of dollars for the university. The fact that\u2019s he has the personality of your median potato isn\u2019t exactly relevant to his usefulness.",

Armstrong makes slightly less than the UCSB president, and slightly more the SDSU. I\u2019d be more pissed about the 50 or so faceless administrators on that list than they guy who makes a pretty normal salary for what his job is.\n\nThis may also not be common knowledge, but he doesn\u2019t pick his own salary. It\u2019s set by the CSU system as a whole, and CSU presidents are actually underpaid compared similar positions in [Texas](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/07/16/two-texas-chancellors-among-five-best-paid-public-university-leaders/) and [New York](https://psc-cuny.org/clarion/2019/april/matos-rodr%C3%ADguez-confirmed-chancellor/). \n\nAs for the ASI comment, they consistently make proposals that are illegal, outside of his power, or expensive (I\u2019m quite happy with fewer fees, thank you very much), so I\u2019m not particularly sympathetic. \n\nAnd again \u201cnot responsive to students\u201d is something said about nearly every single university president in existence.

The inequities he\u2019s created are astounding as are the projects he\u2019s approved that are not actually helping alleviate the problems\u2014they\u2019re creating more problems. And is he actually responsible for reeling in cash? Look into that too to see who is actually bringing in the funds. Then see how he\u2019s mismanaged those funds that he took credit for. Armstrong is kind of a terrible leader, and he is running Poly into the ground. All while faculty are the ones who are left dealing with disgruntled students who can\u2019t get enough classes to keep their financial aid or housing. Armstrong just keeps saying everyone is extremely gruntled while he runs people over with his company car.",

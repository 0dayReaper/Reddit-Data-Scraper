I was recently admitted into cal poly for Computer Engineering but after reviewing my financial aid package I still have to pay around 9k. For me and my family this is a lot of money and im just wondering if it\u2019s even worth getting loans to pay this amount in order to attend?\n\nIm planning on doing work study but I would still owe around 6k so this is where I would have to get loans. I am a first gen so I really don\u2019t know what I should do and I\u2019m really worried. \n\nDoes cal poly give more aid? And is it worth it?",

If there is a significant change in the AGI or any of the above, you should (when they allow you to \u2014 its still closed today) look into filing a financial appeal.     Basically there are two major types \u2014 income decline or extraordinary expenses that affect your cost of attendance.    (For example, thousands of dollars in uninsured medical costs).  They reprocess your numbers, and recompute your EFC, which drives the aid.\n\nThe only thing that sucks is they usually wont let you start this process until after mid June, which is incredibly frustrating.\n\nFeel free to DM me.

I can\u2019t speak for your situation but I personally emailed them talking about why I needed it and I\u2019d really like to go and make it sound nice and neat and then asked if they could do anything about it or give me more aid. I also sent in proof of my situation so for me that was like a more up to date tax form. So basically your greeting + your circumstances that prevent you from attending + what you need + proof if u have it. Also what i\u2019ve seen others do is talk about their other financial aid offers from other schools and then try to negotiate with the school. Don\u2019t actually use the word negotiate but yea, good luck!",

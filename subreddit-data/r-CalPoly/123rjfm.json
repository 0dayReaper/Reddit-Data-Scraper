    "postText": "Got accepted as a transfer for civil engineering and am trying to choose schools. There is about 9-10 courses which my cc never offered that I would need to take on top of the normal classes. This means I would need to stay at least an extra year in order to graduate which isn\u2019t really preferable. Is this normal to happen to transfers?",

Most 4 year students taking 16 credits spread out their GEs, and are taking 12 units + 1-2 GEs, which feels like 3 classes plus some easy nonsense you need to get out of the way once or twice per week.",

You can fulfill it with select writing classes, or you could do a portfolio when I was at CP.\n\nC UD refers to IGETC Area C Upper Division courses. I had to take an upper division (300+ level) course from the IGETC Area C selection after transferring.\n\nI guess GWR isn't technically general ed, but everyone has to take it and it's not major-related unless you're studying something writing related. The C UD course is definitely a gen ed course. There are many other gen ed requirements, but like I said, you can get credit for most of them before transferring like I did.\n\nThe requirements are outlined here: https://ge.calpoly.edu/program/requirements-and-template",

            "comment": "It depends on how much you\u2019re willing to grind. I\u2019ve met plenty of students transfer in as CE and finished in two years, but they were loaded up with classes each quarter. \n\nThe ones who opted to take 12-16 units a quarter finished in 3 years. Due to the way senior design is set up for CEs, and how it\u2019s 3 consecutive quarters starting in the fall, you could potentially be done with all your non senior design courses in 2 years + 1 or 2 quarter if you take the minimum amount of units each quarter but you will still need to be enrolled for the rest of the year for senior design class for the remaining quarters of your last year. There is not a potential to tweak the flow of senior design by the way since it is a group design project and it flows from fall quarter to spring quarter. \n\nIf you do load up with 16+ units each quarter, you could start senior design your second year and potentially only need 2 or 3 classes for one additional quarter and then you graduate in the winter. \n\nPlenty of different scenarios that could play out, but again, it depends on how much you\u2019re willing to prioritize school and grind, as opposed to coming here to party it up. \n\nAnother thing to note is that, transferring in, you\u2019re most likely used to a semester system. Quarter system goes by much faster so you have to be ready to put in the time and work if you load up on units.  Since the semester system at CP isn\u2019t slated to start until 2026, you should not be affected by the switch. \n\nThis might be confusing so if you have any additional questions for clarity, feel free to DM.",

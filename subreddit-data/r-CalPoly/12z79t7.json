If you\u2019re pretty available with decent experience you\u2019ll have no trouble finding a job. But if you don\u2019t have availability and 0 job experience you\u2019ll have a huge issue. The most important thing with employers around here I\u2019ve found is a wide availability. But also completely depends on the type of job u want and where! If u have anymore questions lmk! :)",

I preferred the tutoring and grading gigs that had super flexible scheduling personally (but only were options as upperclassmen)\n\nOn campus jobs are everywhere and there are a ton of options. Most are super flexible with student schedules (I did a lot of 4 hour shifts in between classes) and a huge benefit is that many are closed or have reduced hours when classes aren't in session. Because I would always go home on breaks, this was perfect for me as an undergrad. They are also more accommodating, in my opinion, to midterm/finals schedules.\n\nFor off campus jobs, the big trade off is availability. \n\nGood luck! There are tons of places and Im sure you'll find something!",

They are listed as WLC 290 as we do not have a prefix yet but in due time we will. They are taught by the wonderful Angelica Browne and are lots of fun! You can also make money by taking the course as Russian is considered a critical language and there are many scholarships you can receive for learning it. If you\u2019re interested in taking the course next year, email Angelica Browne! anbrowne@calpoly.edu\u200b \n\n\u0414\u043e \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f!",

I need to be a full-time student to get finaid, so I take filler classes to meet the unit requirement and make them C/NC so that I don't feel the academic pressure to perform in them.",

Low Cs hurt your GPA and I knew I would probably get at least a 70 in these, so it's nice to have them not count towards my gpa. A NC is also way better to have than an F. I was able to pad my GPA significantly by taking easy classes and GEs with normal grading and more difficult ones with C/NC.\n\nDon't do it with notoriously difficult classes though, because a 60 is still passing with normal grading, and you need a 70 if you take C/NC. I'm okay with having a couple Ds on my transcript if it means I don't have to retake the final boss difficulty ones.",

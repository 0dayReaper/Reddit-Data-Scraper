You have the right to ask your dumb questions and we have the right to criticize said dumb questions. Maybe if you\u2019d like a more supportive response you can reach out to either google or maybe admissions directly. Most of this sub is students/alumni who don\u2019t know the answer to your \u201cgeneral questions.\u201d Also you can use the search bar before you post and deduce an answer that is equivalent to what I have told you. Also, if I were to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to your original question it wouldn\u2019t change anything about your current situation. Just be patient and you will find out if you were denied/accepted at some point.",

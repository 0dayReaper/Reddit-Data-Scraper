Polyratings always just gets revived by some new slacker kid in CSC every couple years to fill in as their senior project and then abandoned after they get a job\n\nEvery year this argument comes up again.\n\nTaking users from RMP, a service that will last a long long time and receive continuous support and updates, just hurts the overall student base in the long run.\n\nMuting replies to this because I\u2019ve heard all the bad arguments about this already over the last many years",

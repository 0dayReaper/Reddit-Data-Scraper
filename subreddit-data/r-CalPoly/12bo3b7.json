Not saying that\u2019s the case for everyone and the job market is horrendous right now, but alma mater is forsure something that still catches eyes on a resume and helps get your foot in the door. But you\u2019re right, employers will most likely be unaware of a \u201cdevalued\u201d degree until much further down the line. Either way, cal poly grads will suffer from this at one point or another. Really terrible decision by the school imo",

The idea is that some students show up during the summer, and then do other classes virtually the rest of the year, while other students show up during the year and do summer classes virtually. So Cal poly could then enroll more students, because not all of them will be on campus at the same time. The problem with this is that Cal poly's \"learn by doing\" motto is effective for a reason, and you can't \"do\" at your own house on the couch on zoom.\n\nSome classes like english or math could be taken online, but all the impacted labs (which already fill up and have waitlists 3 times the size of the class (MATE215, CE259, etc)) would have to be taken in person. These labs are limited in professors and classroom size, so increasing the number of labs on campus and hiring faculty to have more sections would be good. Adding a summer semester so that 1/2 in-person/virtual students could be added to the overall school roster would be bad. \u201c\u201d",

Again, you\u2019re going off of hypotheticals even though there is no evidence to suggest that there\u2019s a risk of a degree being devalued. Cal Poly isn\u2019t becoming University of Phoenix by offering year round classes.\n\nIf anything, what is being said is that with this plan, it\u2019s really no different than your typical fall to end of spring semester based system with summers off, BUT with an opportunity to take online classes in the summer. The difference is the allocation of online classes, where instead of those classes being in the summer, they would be in another semester, while summer classes would become mandatory.  That is NOT a risk of devaluation.",

Same with LGBT stuff. We should not have any DEI staff, because people who need that help can look for groups in the community to join, or even a club on campus.\n\nCal poly should also create incentives for student residents to save campus resources so the university overall saves money. For example: In the dorms, we pay a fixed monthly/yearly rate which includes utilities. So if I take a 10min or 60min shower every day, it makes no tangible difference to me. If I leave the lights on 24/7 or turn them off when I leave the dorm, it makes no tangible difference to me. However, if the fixed cost was reduced, and then utilities were added on, Cal poly could start to see students being more responsible because they would have a monetary incentive to use less resources. This could save both the university and the students money.",

            "comment": "Frankly, I don\u2019t understand why if the plan is to move to a more year round situation, why they didn\u2019t do that first before trying to shift calendars. At least with a quarter system, it makes a lot of sense that each period of the year is divided more or less into the same amount of time. Each term you can have classes that are more or less taught at exactly the same pace, unless, of course you do a five week summer course. But basically, Armstrong wants better utilization of the summer term which is basically going to be a de facto quarter, but on a semester-based calendar? That doesn\u2019t really make any sense to me, because then you have to maintain two sets of curricula.\n\nIn all honesty, I would actually be for a more year-round calendar over a semester change if one or the other has to happen. I don\u2019t think summer quarters would ever necessarily be so full, but it definitely would allow for better resource utilization since basically 1/4 of the year (more like 1/3 probably), the campus sits empty. Especially. For people who are planning to do a graduate or professional level degree, this makes a three-year degree a lot more possible since you would have more course offerings throughout the year, instead of simply only 3/4. Also, it would become a lot more feasible for people to take an internship or work opportunity during other parts of the year that are not just summer or be able to stay in certain programs for longer if they so choose, because you could always have a more flexible schedule. There would definitely be hassles and downsides to operating more on a year-round schedule, but I do think that there would actually be tangible benefits that would give students more options.\n\nOverall, I do actually think that there needs to be a lot more discussion about what\u2019s going on with the semester thing and also this. And frankly, to the new incoming students, this is definitely something you should want to consider. Attending a school that is going through a change like this can lead to certain problems if you are really trying to graduate on time. Anyway, I fully expect all of this to be a complete and utter shit show.",

But if they keep roughly the same policies they have now, just don't register for online classes in the summer when you're supposed to take them. Currently you can just take a quarter off without giving an excusal or anything, you just don't register. If there is a class that's only taught online then it will likely be a course that you can take at a community College and transfer the credit over. It'll still be online but will be cheaper.",

The idea is that some students show up during the summer, and then do other classes virtually the rest of the year, while other students show up during the year and do summer classes virtually. So Cal poly could then enroll more students, because not all of them will be on campus at the same time. The problem with this is that Cal poly's \"learn by doing\" motto is effective for a reason, and you can't \"do\" at your own house on the couch on zoom.\n\nSome classes like english or math could be taken online, but all the impacted labs (which already fill up and have waitlists 3 times the size of the class (MATE215, CE259, etc)) would have to be taken in person. These labs are limited in professors and classroom size, so increasing the number of labs on campus and hiring faculty to have more sections would be good. Adding a summer semester so that 1/2 in-person/virtual students could be added to the overall school roster would be bad.",

Q: There's a lot from a course availability, class size, lab perspective that still needs answered but wondering... based on interpretation (because there is not enough detail to know for certain what the plan would require from students) will there be incentive /wondering why a student/parent/supporter would pay for student housing and all that goes with it for an academic year - whether on campus or off - if part of requirement is for students to be abroad or take online courses?  (e.g. how would that work? did I interpret intent wrong? Thinking it would be a tough pill to swallow financially to pay for student housing knowing that students would not really be required to be present in SLO?)\n\nFull letter:\n\nApril 4, 2023\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo the Cal Poly Community:Welcome to spring quarter! Our final 10 weeks always feel like a sprint, so I hope everyone had a chance to rest and refresh over the break.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy messages to the community this year have frequently mentioned the need for Cal Poly to grow. There are many kinds of growth, but for a university the central form is increasing the number of students we serve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are two main reasons why Cal Poly needs more students: (1) every year we turn away enough exceptionally qualified applicants to fill every seat on campus, and there are new incentives from the CSU and the governor to graduate more students, as well as consistent demand from employers for Cal Poly graduates; and (2) one of the few avenues to increase revenue on campus, without asking students to pay more, is to increase enrollment\u2014and we need that additional revenue to achieve important goals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of those goals is ensuring that we grow sustainably. That means that classes must be available when students need them, that we continue to fund the enhanced financial aid that is helping Cal Poly better reflect the diversity of California, and that we don\u2019t overburden our physical or human resources.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA second important goal is raising employee compensation to be both competitive with salaries at peer schools and adequate to meet the Central Coast\u2019s high cost of living. The fact that Cal Poly has such exceptional faculty and staff is a testament to the dedication of those individuals, rather than to the excellence of their compensation. That must change, and as soon as possible, or we risk losing and not being able to replace the very people who make Cal Poly what it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother goal is upgrading and expanding facilities on campus to better educate our students and better support faculty and staff. Like many institutions, universities face a classic chicken-and-egg problem: We can\u2019t expand enrollment until we grow our facilities, but we can\u2019t grow until we expand. Such problems are solved through changes and economies that make modest expansion possible and then using new revenue to fund additional changes necessary for further growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, there are many non-academic staff offices on campus that do absolutely essential work but don\u2019t really need to be on campus to do it (a valuable lesson from the pandemic). So, we are in the process of finding lower-cost, off-campus space for them to relocate into, thereby freeing up higher-cost space on campus for academic purposes. More details will be shared soon on this initiative.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs well, we have several transformative building projects ready to start on campus in coming months, including the long-awaited library renovation, construction of hundreds of new student housing units, and groundbreaking on a second, much-needed faculty and staff housing complex. We are also excited that the William and Linda Frost Center for Research and Innovation is open this quarter. These projects will lay some of the groundwork for expanding the student body without overusing our existing facilities. And some of these projects will play more than one role, such as the use of alternative space on campus for vital library services during the renovation, which will then become flex space to accommodate other temporary dislocations during future building projects once the library transformation is complete.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe also need to make the most efficient use possible of the resources and facilities we do have. As a residential, Learn by Doing campus with high demand for enrollment and for graduates, it is a question of when, not whether, we will shift to a year-round calendar under which students would study on campus for one or two summers and off campus for one or two typical academic terms. This will allow us to expand enrollment and have a larger total student body without increasing our numbers excessively during any given term. We won\u2019t be able to put this fully into effect until after the Quarter-to-Semester transition is complete, but we can\u2019t wait for Quarters-to-Semesters to finish before we start discussing and planning for other needed changes. Meanwhile, we can gather valuable data through pilot projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I would simply like to thank you for reading through this message. I feel it is important to share my thinking with the campus community, so that we can move forward in a spirit of dialogue and collaboration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest wishes for a successful spring quarter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSincerely,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJeffrey D.

And if a professor is great, then you'll most likely be able to get them again in another class down the road.

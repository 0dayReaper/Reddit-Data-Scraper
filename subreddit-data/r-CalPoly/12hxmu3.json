    "postText": "Hey, I'm a freshman admitted to COSAM (math) I want to switch to CPE. Can I do my IMCA right away? in my spring quarter? What is the difference between the two IMCA (1 and 2)? What is the meaning when the requirement state that to switch into CENG, you must be evaluated if you would be admitted in the first place?",

            "comment": "Just an fyi,\nThe switch to CPE is going to be hard. You have to compete to get into the already heavily impacted cs101 sections and receive a decent grade (can be hard depending on background/Professor). Cal Poly requires you to attend 1 quarter of classes before making the switch. I believe you can just enroll yourself into the intro CS class at the end of the summer if there\u2019s any availability, but you will not be able to actually submit an icma. The engineering school also evaluates if you could be admitted in the first place. This involves them looking over your high school stats to see if you qualify to get into CENG. The two Imcas require different things to get in. I believe it has something to do with advising making an evaluation based off of your high school stats. The two agreements have different levels of difficulty, so this is my assumption.\n\nHere\u2019s my advice: don\u2019t choose cal poly on the assumption you can switch. It\u2019s a difficult process and there\u2019s a chance it doesn\u2019t work out. If you are fine pursuing a math major or something Cosam related but would prefer to be in CPE, then I\u2019d say go for it.",

However, if one properly creates a software portfolio as a math major, one can easily get really high level software jobs. R&amp;D needs people in cryptography and algorithms, so having a math and CS background could be a HUGE advantage. If this is the route op wants to go, I\u2019d actually recommend this path over CPE since CPE is really a embedded/c&amp;dh major. There\u2019s also robotics and vision too. A CS minor with a math degree is imo on par with a CPE in the software world.",

It\u2019s more possible to cater a CPE course list to be CS-lite, but a CS minor has this capability given proper class selection. One could also do CS classes as math upper divs.",

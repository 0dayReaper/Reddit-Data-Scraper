    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nIncoming CS transfer for Fall 2023 wanting to go to a top grad program after graduating. Was wondering how easy getting research is here, and if most professors are open to it.\n\nI did some browsing and maybe found 2-3 professors with research interests similar to mine. Was wondering if I should just cold email them, or wait about a quarter to get situated before attempting research.\n\nAlso, is it possible to get research with professors from different colleges, and would doing this be hard?",

It wouldn't hurt to send a short email to a few that have research interests inline with your own. Some are going to disappear over the summer, some will be around, some might have things you can work on now. \n\nWaiting a quarter to get settled in and potentially take a course with someone you are interested in working with could be a good idea as well, depending on how your transition goes. \n\nI'm not sure about getting involved with other departments. Many other departments are happy for cross-disciplinary projects, but again will depend on the faculty member.",

How much really depends, but I don\u2019t think in recent times I\u2019ve taken a train that reaches its terminal station more or less on time. I absolutely wouldn\u2019t discourage anyone from taking Amtrak who needs to, because I think it is a really valuable service, especially if you don\u2019t have a car, but just make sure you plan accordingly.",

Once you're in an apartment (be it on or off campus) it's worth it to actually cook at home if you want good food for relatively cheap",

Vista grande is too much of a walk for me so I just get a bunch of food after class when the food trucks are at the UU. \n\nIt's also probably just me but vista grande food is not bad at all and I'm a picky eater. The burgers from brunch could be better but I just add tapatio and it tastes good to me. I also liked the mac and cheese streats had a while ago but most people like the hispanic menu. Streats menu changes periodically",

I agree it is overpriced but pretty much any campus' food is. And to be fair, compared to the restaurants in slo, the pricing is similar, maybe cheaper. A single bowl of pho from @bites is $20, plate of pad Thai is $15, etc.",

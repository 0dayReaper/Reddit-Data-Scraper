Practically speaking, what is the purpose of the faculty rating system such as polyratings-to let students know which faculty would be best suited to teach them.  It has no bearing on actual teaching evaluations, retentions or pay grade.  Faculty with poor polyratings experience no repercussions, in fact-they may slightly benefit, as students may avoid their courses, thereby under-enrolling.  The faculty member is not paid per student-so regardless if their course enrolls at 15 students or 32, they receive the same wage and benefits-but the faculty member with 15 students has considerably less work in terms of grading and emails.  On the flip side, the faculty with higher ratings get inundated with students wanting to crash their course, and because they tend to be awesome people (hence the high polyrating) enroll over course enrollment caps to help out students in need.  It is reasonable to assume a similar outcome will exist for a staff polyrating type system-with the main caveat being a faculty member has autonomy over if they will over-enroll; a staff member has no say in how many people come to them for assistance.",

Everyone who works at Cal Poly should thus be supporting students either directly (teaching) or indirectly by supporting faculty (staff). Faculty are evaluated by students every quarter and those evaluations are used to determine in whether to rehire/promote  those instructors or not (not including instructors at the top of the food chain). The problems as I see them are 1) faculty are evaluated before the course ends, 2) evaluations are confidential and never seen by students, and 3) staff are never evaluated by anyone other than their supervisors. \n\nThese are big issues, particularly 3) when some staff start realizing that their best career approach is to please their supervisors, which they seem to do at the cost of their service to students and faculty they should be serving. Everyone who works at Cal Poly should be evaluated and the results should be published. PolyRatings provided a great service to students when choosing classes as it helped students figure out how to deal with instructors based on comments of previous students. Wouldn't there be the same potential benefits if staff was evaluated also? \n\nLastly, I totally admit my bias here. I can't tell you how unprofessional it was for a staff member to roll their eyes at me every time I asked them for help. Speaking to their supervisor did nothing. Several of my colleagues experienced the same behavior. Staff need some accountability also. And similarly, staff doing their jobs well deserve some recognition even if it is something non-official such as an external ratings site.",

In general, yes-direct supervisors have an impetus to take the side of faculty/staff under them when dealing with students, but often times will follow up after the student has left.  \\[It would be unprofessional for the supervisor to call out the faculty/staff member under them with others present.\\]  If you feel the situation is such that it needs to be escalated, department staff are not only responsible to their direct supervisor, but also to the Dean of Operations of the College.  The Dean of Operations has less of a personal relationship with individual staff than their direct supervisor do, so if you are looking for an unbiased intervention-that would be the route to go.  This does not mean you will necessarily know if any action is taken, but it is much more unlikely for a Dean of Operations to dismiss an issue with problematic staff, particularly if there are multiple complaints.\n\nI also empathize with what you are saying about the official student evaluation process-but realize that process can't be changed (or the results made public) without an agreement with the Faculty Union.  Many departments are also between a rock and a hard place if they have a low performing faculty member, as finding qualified folks to teach the needed number of courses, that have the right area of expertise and are willing to work as adjunct faculty can be difficult.  Speaking as a department employee, between supporting the mediocre part time hire, or not being able to offer a course that has student demand, I support the mediocre part time hire every time.  I don't look at Poly Ratings, as only their Student Evaluations are actionable (so do fill out your Student Evaluations), and as long as they meet the minimum requirements, it makes more sense to extend their appointment.  Students have a hard enough time getting courses without cutting seat availability and offerings.\n\nI do think Poly Ratings has a value for students in terms of finding faculty that they can learn from; but I still contend, for all the reasons I previously mentioned, that having a Poly Rating type system for staff would be not just ineffective, but harmful to high performing staff.\n\nI think we have co-opted this thread, so if you would like to continue the discussion, feel free to message me.",

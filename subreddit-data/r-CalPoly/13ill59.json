So the people who don\u2019t have a roommate group or are in groups of two and have a later room pick slot will end up in this rooms",

I had a lot of experience with this in my 2 years in PCV. \n\nI had a double with no roommate for 2 quarters (fall 2019 and winter 2020) before COVID. The landscape was a lot different then tho and my 6-person apartment had a whole empty double in fall (50% capacity) and an additional empty single in winter (my roommates in singles were masters students finishing up a couple classes). I never heard about anyone else in a similar situation.\n\nI had a 4 person apartment during COVID for the 2020-2021 school year. On move-in day only 3 rooms were listed online as full (me and my two friends). Despite that, a fourth roommate was also moving in that day and showed up online a couple days later. He graduated at the end of fall and we had winter just the 3 of us. In like week 8 of winter quarter we got an email from housing that the room would be filled again at the end of spring break and that's how it went down. In your housing contract you waive any right to a minimum warning tho. \n\nSince COVID PCV has been packed so don't count on it being empty for a whole quarter and you won't get burned. A half empty double is cool tho",

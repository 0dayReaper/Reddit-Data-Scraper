I went to a couple of hackathons which I 100% recommend especially ones at different universities. It was really fun to learn new technologies and socialize. There are not many CS extracurriculars at Cal Poly as I would've liked and I ended up not joining any of the clubs so I learned things that interested me on my own. It is really what you make of it but for me, I would have done everything the same if given the chance.\n\nFeel free to pm me if you have any other questions :)",

My best friend (20F, comp sci major) and I (20M, Enve engineering) are looking for off campus housing for the 23-24 year after a situation with our current roommate is forcing us to leave. We\u2019re both very respectful, chill people. Not super party-oriented, but we don\u2019t mind if you are. If you have a situation that could work for us, please dm me, and if not, a tip on where else to look would be greatly appreciated",

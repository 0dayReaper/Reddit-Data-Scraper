            "comment": "MATH 306: This is your first *real* proof class after 248. It requires many hours of head scratching and will be the class that takes up the most of your time. But don\u2019t be discouraged, linear algebra is applicable in virtually everything and you\u2019ll learn a lot of math and your proof skills will greatly improve.\n\n*if you are taking 306 in the next year, come to workshop. I found it useful so hopefully you will too*\n\nMATH 334: This class is also on the more difficult side when I took it. It requires a lot of outside-the-box thinking and will also take up a huge chunk of your time. Usually not proof-heavy but you still need to apply 248 techniques (in a \u201ccombinatorial\u201d way). On the plus side, it gets easier at the end when you get to generating function.\n\nMATH 437: I personally haven\u2019t taken this class but from what I\u2019ve heard from the people taking it this quarter, it\u2019s actually not bad. Game theory is really useful in finance and econ. There are proofs here and there but it is mostly computation, so if you\u2019re good at 241 and matrix algebra, you\u2019ll find it cake.\n\nMATH 412: easily considered one of the hardest class for an undergraduate math major. The class is essentially building calculus from the ground up. This class will again take up a huge chunk of your week. On the other hand, this is one of those classes where if you get it, you get it. I struggled a bit at the start, but once you\u2019ve got your wheels running, everything just seems very routine. You\u2019ll gain a greater appreciation for calculus (especially calc 3) after this class. Furthermore, one can continue the intro to analysis sequence and eventually get to measure theory, which is very important in statistics.\n\nI\u2019m glad to field any other question you have!",

I recommend these two for basically any student from a career standpoint.\n\nFinance is very hit or miss, as the recruitment is pretty bad for the concentration but the best finance concentration students do manage to snag a few top investment banking and tech finance roles every year. I\u2019d say only do finance if you have it in you to carry yourself through recruitment, because the school won\u2019t.\n\nQuant is a very small concentration but a good choice if you want to build a statistics foundation and form an analytical mindset.\n\nRE finance can be cool, I know some people get their realtor licenses for their senior project. But overall I\u2019d recommend finance instead. \n\nEntrepreneurship is by far the easiest concentration, and overall you\u2019ll meet a lot of people who do it because it\u2019s so easy. But Cal Poly does have a thriving entrepreneurial community, so if you are actually serious about being an entrepreneur, it\u2019s a viable concentration.\n\nConsumer packaging is cool but very small. At that point I\u2019d wonder why you\u2019re not an ITP major since it makes more sense, but the packaging program is strong here so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s decent.\n\nAvoid marketing unless you want to be a salesman, because that\u2019s basically what everyone goes into afterwards and those are the marketing recruiters who come to campus.\n\nHR\u2026 don\u2019t lol.",

    "postText": "Ok basically just what the title says. I'm currently a senior in high-school, and while I was rejected from SLO this year, I want to try to transfer next year. I just got off the waitlist at UCSC to major in Psychology and I have until May 12th to decide if I'm accepting the offer to get off the waitlist, or if I'm staying with my original school Cal Poly Humboldt(also majoring in psych). I picked Humboldt originally because it is a Cal Poly and I figured that would give me an edge when it came to transfering, but UCSC is definitely the better school so what do you think? Stay in the Cal Poly system or go to UCSC?",

It definitely helped her, but she never got to have the real freshman yr \"college experience\" at her CC, and by the time she did transfer, a little bit of the magic that 4 year colleges have to highschool seniors who are ab to become real adults was gone",

Keep in mind that Cal Poly only accepts junior (not sophomore) transfers, and the criteria for transferring is very major-specific, so be sure to look that up on the admissions website.  Also, just being candid that Cal Poly\u2019s psych program is super competitive for admissions.  This year, Cal Poly anticipates enrolling 73 out of 3,579 first time freshman applicants for psychology and 39 out of 717 new transfer applicants.",

High crime rates, housing is expensive, not much to do at all, economy is bad, somewhat dangerous.

One thing I'm leaning towards right now is doing suicide hotline work bc as far as I'm aware you only need a bachelor's in Psychology, and doing work that is both time and location flexible would give me an opportunity to go to auditions (I act) but if I end up really getting passionate about a field that requires further education then I have no problem doing that",

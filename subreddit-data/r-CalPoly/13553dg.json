    "postText": "Hi guys! I\u2019ve been looking at quarter+ recently and have seen some mixed feelings. Some say it\u2019s great and the credits are a nice little bonus, others that it\u2019s really not worth the time and cost.\n\nAlso, when I was looking at the gen eds that are available, I didn\u2019t find anything that would apply to a comp sci major (other than the coms course that everyone takes). So, any insight would be greatly appreciated\u2014thanks!",

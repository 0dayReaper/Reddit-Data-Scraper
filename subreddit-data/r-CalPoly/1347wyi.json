    "postText": "Hey all, I know the decision date is literally tmr, but I'm still unsure about where to go. I visited both campuses, really liked both but had no particular preference for either. I was lucky enough to received enough aid that it doesn't matter financially where I go. I'm pretty shy and awkward most of the time though, but I doubt that makes a difference in my decision. It now really comes down to the particular physics department of each school and my options when it comes to grad school (I'm planning on going straight for a Physics PhD). Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time!",

            "comment": "As a current physics major, I love it here. My classes have been very small, even my non-major ones. The major is small and tight-knit (around 50 majors per year, around 200 at any given time). The physics student lounge(called h-bar), is a great place to meet other majors and get help/advice on anything from classes to life in general.\n\nPretty much every Professor I\u2019ve had knows me by name. I\u2019m going to be doing research this summer with a professor, the summer going into my third year. I know people are started research their first year!\n\nYou will get unparalleled experience in labs. You get to do things hands on from the very beginning, it\u2019s great. \n\nI will say the downside is that there is no masters or PhD program here, so if you want to go directly to PhD you will have to apply elsewhere. If you want to go direct to industry this is an incredible school to do it because of all the hands on experience you get. I know many majors applying for grad school though, so don\u2019t let that put you off at all.\n\nI can\u2019t really comment on the UCI program because I have zero information about it.\n\nFun fact, the physics program here is the largest in the country in terms of undergraduate students :)",

You\u2019ll relatively easily be able to find research with a professor once you take the intro physics courses(maybe even before), and you get lots of hands on experience which summer research (REUs, labs, internships, etc) love.",

Really nice, clear on expectations, and lenient if you\u2019re somewhat responsible and participate in class. \n\nA lot of people cheat in her classes which is sad bc she is very knowledgeable. Give a very smart professor a bare bones econ class and students who don\u2019t care about the material, you\u2019ll get bad reviews.\n\nFor AGB 310, the class was basic tools for finance. Not a course she designed, not a whole lot to it. If Econ was my focus I\u2019d want her for 400 level classes.\n\nLanguage barrier was nonexistent, some people expected that to be a problem and avoided her class. Hope this helped, it was kind of a ramble.",

I decided not to pull old reviews from other platforms as I think teachers can have a fresh start and my rating system is a little different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf people end up using the site I can maintain it, add new features, and open source it. So if you like it please add your teachers and give them a review!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[calpolyratings.com](https://calpolyratings.com)\n\n[https://github.com/erib3/calpolyratings](https://github.com/muderibe/calpolyratings)\n\nedit: I just added 700 teachers and around 4000 posts from polyratings. I only took posts from 2016 and more recent. The posts pulled from polyratings do not have any effect on a teacher's rating but they are available to see on their page.\n\nThank you to u/BetoBob for data.",

If you are passionate about attending cal poly then you should express continued interest and bring up a couple key points from your essay. If you plan on talking to a admissions officer, your conversation should flow well, most people don\u2019t enjoy listening to an essay in person (no offense).",

I would make an appointment with the admissions officer before going up there because they are probably crazy busy. \nIn terms of appealing. I don\u2019t want to get too specific because this person is in a smaller major, but they got in contact with one of the professors in the major they were waitlisted in and got them to make a case for them. They had some F\u2019s on their transcript because a family emergency didn\u2019t allow them to finish the semester, so the professor argued that the school should not consider the F\u2019s in the GPA.",

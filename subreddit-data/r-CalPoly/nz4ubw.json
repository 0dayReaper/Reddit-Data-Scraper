The way they\u2019ve changed graduation makes it just long and brutal to go through. It probably wasn\u2019t as bad this year since each college had its own ceremony, but I\u2019m kind of sad that it\u2019s basically killed off a lot of department ceremonies. I get that they think it\u2019s cool to have everyone\u2019s name ride, but I really don\u2019t understand what the problem was with how it was done before, especially since most colleges do it that way. Maybe is there are some people that disagree with me, but every graduation I\u2019ve been to recently has just been kind of a shit show, with the exception of the fall ceremonies. I actually think that one is OK, even though there\u2019s nothing department specific which is kind of sad. Trade offs i suppose. \n\nI think something that could be much better would just be some kind of celebration for people to get to say goodbye to all of their friends, classmates, and faculty, or I guess in this case catch up. I know in theory that there are other events that are supposed to do this, but it certainly would be nice if there was some kind of special reception. Some thing that\u2019s just for 2020 grads. I kind of think that uptake on this would still be a bit lackluster, but as opposed to trying to get people to coordinate with their families and friends to get people up to see them actually graduate, I think something that might just give some people closure and which would be more doable it\u2019s just to get to say goodbye to people. Maybe go out for a drink one last time with friends in slo, but A full on graduation ceremony at this point would definitely be a hassle for most.",

                            "comment": "If it makes you feel any better, when I did the graduation ceremony, it was very anticlimactic. And I actually did the fall ceremony, which I thought was OK all things considered. All of the spring ceremonies (at least in the past few years) have been to have just been long and drawn out. Reading everyone\u2019s name at the main ceremony is entirely unnecessary and, especially when they do it with multiple colleges, there are just too many people. I kind of hate raining on your parade, and I know that often times graduations are more important for family and friends, and can be very important in some families, but I also think that a good number of people end up finding that graduation is just kind of a meh experience at best.\n\nThat being said, you would think that it would\u2019ve made sense for them to offer something to 2020 grads. I suspect, the main reason they didn\u2019t do anything now was to ensure that they would have enough capacity for the 2021 grads, which kind of sucks, but that\u2019s the way it is. You would think maybe they would do it next weekend or something like that, but renting all of the stage equipment for an entire week probably would\u2019ve been prohibitively expensive for them, especially if a lot of people weren\u2019t interested in coming back. \n\nI think at this point what they might end up doing is simply letting people who want to graduate come back and do the ceremony in fall. And honestly, as long as you have the proper robe, I don\u2019t actually think anyone would stop you if you decided you wanted to go participate in fall commencement. Seating isn\u2019t assigned of course, and this would be a problem if too many people did it, but the way they read your names as you fill out a little card and they just read it when you get to walk across the stage. No one in line checks to make sure that you actually are a graduate, so the system can definitely be game to hear. I\u2019m not sure I would necessarily advise anyone to do this, but if you want the whole pomp and circumstance and a photo, then you can get that. The only thing you might not be able to get our actual tickets to the ceremony for parents and supporters, but I\u2019ve also found that during the fall ceremony it\u2019s possible to just get in without a ticket, though you\u2019ll probably miss the beginning of the ceremony. Again, not advised, in kind of a risky strategy, but if you don\u2019t hear anything back, and it really bothers you enough, then this is probably your best option. I think it would be kind of shitty for the university to actually retaliate or do anything since no alternative was offered. But then again, petty stuff like this certainly hasn\u2019t been dropped before. Anyway, again, I\u2019m not advising anyone to do this, and I would actually advise that you not do this, but I am just raising it as a Hypothetical thing you could do.\n\nI do think it might be worthwhile if anyone is a member of the alumni Association to reach out to them and to let them know that there are some current alumni that would love the opportunity to actually have a ceremony. Maybe it\u2019s not that many, but Cal poly and the alumni Association should send out a few emails asking people about whether or not they would like to attend a ceremony and how many people they would be likely to bring with them. This would give Cal poly at least some idea of how many people would like to come back and what exactly they should do. Should they just fold these extra people into the fall ceremonies? Should they do separate ceremonies for 2020 graduates? I don\u2019t know the answer of course, but if they\u2019re going to do outreach and make plans, then they probably should have started already. If anything, it should be pitched as an opportunity for them to get people connected with the alumni Association and of course start asking them for money lol.\n\nAnyway, best of luck. I know it kind of sucks and I feel bad for you all. Hope this gets sorted out.",

    "postText": "Currently a City &amp; Regional Planning student here. I am curious about what Cal Poly's reputation is in this field (or adjacent fields like transportation planning or urban design). I know it is a small program so not many people will be aware of it in the same way they are aware of the engineering or architecture programs here. I also heard that at least in the US, urban planning is primarily a \"graduate degree thing\" and very few schools offer an undergraduate degree in urban planning.  (This made me reluctant at first to switch to it.) I know both the BSCRP and MSCRP are accredited by the PAB, while many other undergraduate planning programs (like USC's I believe) are not, but what does that actually mean in terms of one's ability to get a job with the degree? Are there other well-known schools that offer a PAB-accredited undergraduate program like Cal Poly? Generally, what is the reputation of the Cal Poly CRP program like in the industry, in California, or nationally? I know it is good, but how good? How does it compare to other top schools for that major?",

Literally this program is nationally recognized in the industry as a top flight school. Stop sweating it.  Case in point look at most of the city staff and private sector staff around here. We are all poly grads.",

I actually discovered the channel independently and found out later that he worked for Cal Poly, so that was a pleasant surprise.",

I'm working for Kimely Horn rn, and a good amount of the planning staff in our office are Poly grads. \n\n\nIn the planning industry, we have a great reputation because we are basically turnkey new hires. Get an internship to apply your knowledge, and you'll be fine when you're job searching!",

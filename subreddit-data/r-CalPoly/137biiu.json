    "postText": "Hey Slo, \n\nWas looking at my flowchart (am an incoming freshy), and I have no idea what it meant: could anyone help? \n\nI'm mostly just confused about following:\n\nDo I have to take the expository writing class all 3 quarters? What if I passed my AP lit exam, took an English class over the summer at a community college, and am probably gonna pass my ap lang exam?\n\nWTF is a GE? \n\nWhy is the \"quarter\" system split into 3 parts? Shouldn't it be a trimester?\n\nThanks! Sorry if any of these questions are stupid\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tflgxxfy6rxa1.png?width=312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=60758111991ed27ef46fb24f08319ada21a6b9bb",

            "comment": "1) no you don't take it all 3 quarters. when it's extended over like that, it means it can be taken in any of those quarters. If you pass the AP lit exam, you get credit for the very intro English. I'm not sure about taking it over summer at community college \n\n2) GE is general education. A set of categories of classes (history, arts, etc) that everyone has to take. Classes outside your major. \n\n3) no clue why it's called a quarter, but it is. 11 weeks. Sept-Dec, Jan-March, end of March/early April- June",

You can bend things and move them around if you need to.\n1. No, you don\u2019t have to take expository writing three times. Those long blocks like that indicate that you can take that course any time during those three quarters, basically wherever you can fit it into your schedule.\n2. They\u2019ve changed the English requirements for engineering majors I believe, so I\u2019m not sure your AP lit exam or even a cc course would fulfill the requirement because (I think) they\u2019ve combined the Tech Writing and the general ed English requirement into one class. So while your ap exam probably fulfills general ed I don\u2019t think it would cover tech writing. I\u2019m not sure about that though - highly recommend calling the Mustang Success Center with that question.\n3. A GE is a General Education course - any course that isn\u2019t related to your major but is still a graduation requirement. (For Aero that means most of your humanities classes)\n4. There are four quarters, fall winter spring summer. Only three are on the flowchart because most people like to take the summer off, but taking classes during the summer quarter is an option.",

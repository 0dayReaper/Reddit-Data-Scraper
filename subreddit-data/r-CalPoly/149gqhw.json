            "comment": "It depends on your GPA and how far under the requirement it is. Usually if your GPA slips as an RA, you\u2019ll have a talk with your CSD and put a plan in place for how you\u2019ll work to improve your GPA in the next quarter. If fall quarter is going to be your first quarter as an RA, there is a chance your offer could be rescinded.",

If you have the contact information for the CSD or AD that interviewed you, they would be a good place to start! Otherwise check the housing website and reach out to any of the CSDs or ADs via email - if they can\u2019t help you they\u2019ll be able to direct you to the correct person.",

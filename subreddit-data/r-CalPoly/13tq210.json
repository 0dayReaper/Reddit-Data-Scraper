I see no further ahead in my life than three days into the future. Unless there's a vacation planned, then I think ahead further. I have no concerns for how my lack of care will affect me in the future. So, who is the easiest prof???\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(yes this is sarcasm)",

Most of what I look for with GEs is the second type of professor, but I'll take the first type if the others are type three.",

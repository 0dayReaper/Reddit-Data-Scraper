I do agree with their regulation on Bird, Lime, etc. While I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not in the majority, rental users tend to be careless with the devices &amp; also tend to have less experience rising. It leads to more accidents and frankly just wreaks havoc on campus. I\u2019ve seen it firsthand and it isn\u2019t great. I have yet to see a single skater crash, but many rental scooters eat shit.",

The policy dates back a good 20+ years. The eboards can go faster, so they can keep up with traffic and not be a nuisance on the road, while having the breaking capability to ensure safety, and then the remote capability to avoid runaway. On top of that, given the weight and other aspects of the nature of eSkates, people are less likely to do tricks and cause property damage.",

    "postText": "I was recently admitted to cal poly and on the terms of admission it says you must follow through and get good grades in your self reported classes. Although I may end up having a schedule change for my last trimester of senior year and I was wondering if they could take back their acceptance if I don\u2019t take a class I said I was going to. I called the admission office but they were not very helpful.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! Y\u2019all may remember me from [this post I made last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPoly/comments/ucs1ko/wow_leaders_yall_think_we_should_organize/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) asking for WOW Leaders to get paid. That effort was successful, as WOW Leaders got paid $400 last year and received parking for the week.\n\nWell, I now have another opportunity for you to get engaged! This time with a petition you can sign and read here: [M4JPetition](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHmIfRwBu4Z2Kby-pJYyjdoxowJeRJ3z64s8-IpUnoJ_oTjA/viewform). This petition has 4 main goals:\n\n1. Safer Funding and Title IX Reforms\n   1. This campus is the [worst in the CSU](https://mustangnews.net/its-coming-out-of-the-shadows-cal-poly-has-among-the-highest-reports-of-sexual-assault-in-the-csu-system/) for the number of sex crimes.\n   2. Safer, which is touted as the main resource for victims, is incredibly underfunded and [Title IX is harmful to students](https://mustangnews.net/students-feel-powerless-over-title-ix-system-as-not-all-reports-investigated-data-shows/) that use that option.\n2. DRC Funding\n   1. This campus is incredibly inaccessible, and there are only 4 DRC access specialists for the whole campus.\n3. Affordable Housing\n   1. An [eighth of students experience houselessness](https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/basicneeds/1/images/2018%20Basic%20Needs%20Report.pdf), and housing continues to raise rates at [5% per year](https://cpslo.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/BoardofDirectors/EeVmB-uksr1OkgYRnhpzRIsB3qZkST_WpNEO90oS8px8Pg?e=2VKyzq), becoming far more expensive than SLO.\n   2. They're also planning to spend [$900,000,000 building only 2500 new beds](https://cpslo.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/BoardofDirectors/EeVmB-uksr1OkgYRnhpzRIsB3qZkST_WpNEO90oS8px8Pg?e=2VKyzq), which students will have to pay for.\n4. Fighting Food Insecurity\n   1. [Two of every five students on campus experience food insecurity](https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/basicneeds/1/images/BASIC%20NEEDS%20REPORT%202022_0.pdf), while campus dining [appropriates hundreds of thousands of dollars](https://mustangnews.net/where-do-surplus-campus-dining-dollars-go/) from dining plans being forfeited at the end of every year.\n   2. Campus dining should do far more to combat food insecurity, but instead, [prices are far more expensive than SLO](https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/craynes_calpoly_edu/EVUk5eJ49GJAm1RzGssgV9sBrKWbM_BF2cJHdYH7WcHRUw?e=Sho2GQ) and are about to [privatize the day-to-day operations of Campus Dining](https://mustangnews.net/cal-poly-corporation-passes-campus-dining-operations-to-private-food-service-group/), leading to future exploitation.\n\nCal   Poly students have been struggling with one or several of these and  I\u2019m sure we all know someone who has dealt with them at one point.  Campus administration and the Cal Poly Corporation repeatedly refuse to engage effectively with these issues.\n\nIf you care about these issues or want to read more, please sign our petition here: [M4JPetition](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHmIfRwBu4Z2Kby-pJYyjdoxowJeRJ3z64s8-IpUnoJ_oTjA/viewform).\n\nAs of writing this, the petition has over 120 signatures.

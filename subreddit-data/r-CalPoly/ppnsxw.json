    "postText": "Woodstock\u2019s Pizza is nowhere close to being the best pizza place in SLO. Woodstock\u2019s Pizza sucks.\n\nYes, they have a great location.\nYes, the staff are perfectly friendly and acceptable.\nNo, this isn\u2019t some woke political BS about the ownership. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re red, blue, black, white, rainbow, green, whatever and I don\u2019t care.\n\nThis is purely a post about their pizza being the absolute WORST for the price you can get in SLO.\n\nTheir dough is thick and chewy af. It feels like fucking bubble gum whenever I eat the crust. There\u2019s none of the lovely airy light rise that pizza dough is supposed to have in it. They slop sauce on it so thick that the toppings all slide off after the first bite every time. No proper cohesion. They fold their crust over into this large wedge around the edge so that you get objectively less toppings per pizza by diameter. I\u2019m pretty sure they have no idea what spices are. Or salt. Or F-L-A-V-O-R.\n\nAnd for all this they charge you $30.50 for a 16\u201d XL!!\nTHIRTY DOLLARS AND 50 FUCKING CENTS.\nWhy the extra 50cents? IDK, because fuck you.\n\nI don\u2019t know who the marketing person is at Woodstock\u2019s but they deserve a raise for convincing every college student and every lack-of-taste adult in SLO that their pizza is actually worth eating.\n\nThey\u2019re probably going to sponsor every ASI and campus housing event you\u2019re going to be at. You\u2019re going to see their name on the back of every free fucking t-shirt you\u2019re given at every athletics event and intramural league and UU rally and whatever else this year. Don\u2019t fall for this marketing BS.\n\nHere are at least 7 pizza places better than Woodstock\u2019s, one for every fucking day of the week if you need it:\n\n1.\tBear and the Wren: personal favorite. Proper Italian thin crust wood fired. Get the Bee Stang, or the Corn+Prosciutto. ~$20-$22 per pizza. Great for a date.\n2.\tPetra: Close second. Get the BBQ chicken, or the garlic chicken, or the greek feta. Fucking bomb. Loads of toppings. $26/XL (15\u201d). Way better price for the amount of pizza and toppings you\u2019re going to get.\n3.\tFlour house: bring a date. Or your parents. More proper classic Italian pizza. $17-$22 for a pizza. So many great choices, but the classic Margarita for $17 is a great place to start. Also, you can order a FUCKING METER OF PIZZA AS A TASTING. It\u2019s dope, go try it.\n4.\tGuiseppe\u2019s: another proper Italian place. Go in for a full pizza or stop in for a slice at the take out counter when you\u2019re downtown.\n5.\tHotel SLO: $16-$18 for a pizza normally BUT ALSO there\u2019s HALF PRICE pizza and $5 beer Mondays on the roof. The pizza is great. The roof at sunset is the shit.\n6.\tBlaze/Blast 825 Taproom: look this is basically the subway/chipotle model for pizza and it\u2019s nowhere near as good as the others on this list but it\u2019s still better than Woodstock\u2019s and they have like a thousand beers to try as well.\n7.\tFUCKING COSTCO. $10.78 for a huge fucking pizza tax included. The drive out there will cost you like $2 in gas and you\u2019ll save $20 over Woodstock\u2019s. Costco doesn\u2019t make \u201cproperly good\u201d pizza but they make delicious food court pizza that\u2019s cheap as fuck. I lived off this shit in college. You can get 3 meals out of one of these suckers. And it tastes better and lasts better than most of the pizzas on here.\n\nRant over, welcome to SLO, make good pizza choices.\n\nPS: Firestone is overrated as fuck too.\n\nedit: Fatte\u2019s deserves an honorable mention for price, I definitely lived on that 2:1 deal for a bit.",

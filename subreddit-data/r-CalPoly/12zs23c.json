I only have 3 classes left in my catalog but wanted to take classes that could better help land a job. I am currently enrolled to take BUS 393 &amp; 497 over the summer as they seem useful with my degree. I have takes summer classes in the past 2 after my first year and 3 after my second. They have been manageable as I didn't have a job and had plenty of free time. HMU if you are planning on taking either or both of these.",

            "comment": "Hiya. I am the only 2nd year CPE 100% on the new catalog. The reason there is so much friction is because the catalog took a massive change between 2021-2022 and 2022-2026. Namely the new circuits is used as a replacement to the EE prereqs. I took the initial 2 classes written (EE 215 and EE 315) this past Fall and Winter respectively. The way I got in was by using a permission number to enroll into EE 215 (I called up the EE office in August to get it). From there, they had no reason to deny me from switching. Other than one other continuing student (who was going to stay on their catalog and just substitute the series for the standard requirements), I was the only non-transfer in the class. \n\nKeep this in mind: I believe that CPE circuits will likely be a very small series designed for the current freshmen/new transfers. It may be very competitive to get. I definitely would NOT switch until you have enrollment in the first class in the series. EE 115 is the first in the series and will be offered in Fall of 2023. Since EE 115 hadn't been designed yet (it will be written during spring/summer based off of results of EE 215 and 315), they let us use our circuits 1 class (either at cal poly or a cc) to count as equivalent credit for EE 115. I heard from someone in my class that this will not be allowed in future, but they could be wrong. Talk to Slivovsky (our department chair) about it, as she will be the most up to date and accurate.\n\nI do know others who 'changed' to the new catalog, but didn't enroll into the new circuit series since there was no apparent way to do it (it was also barely spoken about). This means they effectively have to do the old catalog to substitute for EE 115, 215, and 315. They also have the new ethnic studies and CS security class requirement. This isn't really ideal, as you gain nothing and now have to take additional classes in place of others. I believe the overall unit count of the major may be raised by pursuing this method. Unless you want to make advising mad at you, do not pursue this method.\n\nActually switching catalogs is relatively straightforward. You need to just get a counselor to send over a form to confirm the change. You both sign it and bippity boppity you're done. If anyone has questions about the new series, I can answer them. Hope it helps!",

That's a whole separate issue regarding assist.org and how different college administrations talk. It should take like a year to fix if transfers are lucky.",

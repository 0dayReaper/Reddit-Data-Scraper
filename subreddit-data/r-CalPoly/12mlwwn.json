    "postText": "hi, i\u2019m a prospective transfer student at Cal Poly and I was wondering if there was much of a queer community? I\u2019m from the SF bay area, which is pretty well known for being LGBT friendly, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll have trouble finding a community at SLO. Specifically, are there many trans and gender non-conforming people? And are there any gay bars? The only place I\u2019ve heard about is a gay coffee shop called skipper\u2019s. I\u2019m also considering CSULB, which I know has a lot of queer people, but I really love SLO for it\u2019s academics and the smaller town vibe.",

As far as I'm concerned, it isn't massive, but there's a good community, and though the LGBTQ+ community is definitely underrepresented, it's not in a harassment or hate sort of way, just in a \"there could be a lot more here\" kind of way - which is why it would be great to have you!\n\nCP also has a Pride center and they put on events regularly. Last I checked there was a Queer Student Union, CP hosts a Pride week every year, there's a gender-inclusive housing option. There are gay and gay-friendly events happening every once and awhile. In fact, I just photographed an LGBTQ+ art showing recently (https://namu.love/2023/02/18/common-ground-collaborative-exhibit/) and there was a great turnout. \n\nIn SLO itself, there are quite a few businesses that are openly gay-friendly and there's the Gala Center (https://galacc.org). If you reach out to them, I'm sure they can give you more info.\n\nEditing to add: I just did a fashion shoot with @famemakers, and over about four hours of walking around downtown while shooting, he got a ton of compliments and no hate (scroll through for the fire pink outfit, lol). \n\nhttps://namu.love/2023/04/13/fashion-portrait-session-with-famemaker/",

I found my wife there and some of my best friends who I talk with every day. I can\u2019t speak for csulb and I definitely can\u2019t say that SLO county or cal poly administration help the queer community in any way. But you\u2019ll definitely find us there because we are very visible, out and proud.  \n\nAlso I super recommended skippers, out of all the businesses in DT SLO they have done the most for the community (they also just have really good coffee imo).",

            "comment": "I'm a queer, I currently live with a fellow queer. \n\nI went random roomate my freshman year and they switched out as soon as they found out I was queer. \n\nOn the same coin, I went random again sophomore year and out of the four of us there was only one straight cis, we had fun inducting them into queer culture which they happily accepted, I think it was my favorite living situation ever. So I would absolutely suggest choosing the queer residential living community. It will be the best experience of your life.\n\nOff the top of my head theres TQSU (trans and queer student union), the pride center. Then there's clubs where, while they aren't specifically queer spaces, everyone there is queer. I'm sure there are more but tbh I haven't made a point of looking for them, I usually just hang out and do major related things and everyone there has always been super accepting. \n\nApart from that instance freshman year I've never encountered anything like that ever again, so while slo has assholes and probably less accepting spaces, it is by and large a good place for a queer to live.",

Definitely a big gnc crowd too, though depending on your major there may only be a few trans folks. \n\nAs others mentioned, there\u2019s the trans and queer student union, pride center, out in stem, cal poly drag club, gender equity center, and a therapy group. There\u2019s a couple other clubs as well I think! Every year there\u2019s a pride prom and a bunch of other events!\n\nAs for in the community, no gay bars though if you go downtown with some queer friends it\u2019s pretty fun and safe. As for coffee shops, there\u2019s skippers, but Linnaea\u2019s is my go-to for queer coffee shop (it doesn\u2019t hurt I know all the people that work there). Also bliss cafe. Occasionally there\u2019s events there, libertine, and SLO Brew Rock. And there\u2019s also a Rocky Horror show that happens sometimes!\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of queer folks if you go looking :)\n\nThe university is in the process of getting a lot more gender neutral bathrooms, though there can be homo/transphobia on campus. There\u2019s gonna be a Chick-fil-A next year unless campus dining changes their mind due to student outrage. I haven\u2019t had an explicit transphobic experience with a professor though I have heard of bad experiences. Hope this helped!",

            "comment": "A late response here but as a queer person:\n\nIt's not huge, but it is accessible - at least, in my opinion. As others have mentioned, there are quite a few LGBTQ+ organizations on campus, such as the Pride Center, TQSU, oSTEM, Drag Club, etc. Students tend to be more accepting of gender-neutral pronouns, neopronouns, xenopronouns, and trans/non-binary identities than faculty, although even the faculty that misgender me don't do it out of malice or \"their own beliefs\" or anything like that and try not to repeat that in the future. That being said, the misgendering and transphobia is certainly real, it can be tiring af correcting everyone, and that's where the safe spaces I mentioned earlier can help out a ton. The good news is that these spaces tend to be super accepting and if there are any misunderstandings or conflicts among members they tend to be resolved quickly and maturely, from my experience.\n\nNone of this is obviously going to negate the fact that Cal Poly is a PWI and is simply not the most diverse college, to begin with. The school also still has a lot of work to do in terms of being inclusive and mindful of its students. But as someone who came here to be primarily focused on academics, it isn't all bad. Then again, I can't say everyone has had my experiences, which is why I'm happy to see a bunch of responses below.",

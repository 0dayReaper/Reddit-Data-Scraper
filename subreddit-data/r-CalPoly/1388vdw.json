    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI will most likely be transferring here for Fall 2023 for CS and had a question regarding masters post undergrad.\n\nI know CP SLO has a masters program here, but I would like to do my masters elsewhere. The programs I'm aiming for are ones at UCLA, USC, or Stanford. I understand it'll be difficult to get into these programs specifically, but my question is if my chances would be any different than other people already attending these colleges. Also, say for UCLA if I would be behind others in terms of theoretical knowledge since UCLA seems to be a theoretical school suited for research, and SLO is more practical.\n\nThis was probably a dumb question, but I felt the need to ask anyways. Also, any tips for maybe improving my chances at getting into these programs? (Like maybe trying to get close to professors at these colleges or just try and stay busy with internships, etc...)\n\nMy other option is if I don't get into any of these programs straight out of undergrad is to work a few years and then try again since I think it might be better that way anyways.",

            "comment": "Your chances of getting into an MS in CS program at UCLA, Stanford or USC would depend much more on your performance in your undergraduate work than on where your BS degree is from. Especially true for public schools (Stanford's grad CS admissions are really competitive, I don't know their level of interest in admitting MS students these days).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are worried about getting the \"right\" knowledge at Cal Poly for continuing with the MS in CS program at UCLA, I recommend doing a comparative analysis of the BS in CS curriculum in the two schools to see what courses are required, and what technical electives would be available to you.  With both schools (for the time being) on quarters, it's  going to be a reasonably close match, give or take a few courses.",

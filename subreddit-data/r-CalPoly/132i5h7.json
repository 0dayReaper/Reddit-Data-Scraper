    "postText": "I\u2019m a possible incoming freshman, and was wondering if switching majors, whether within the same college(ex anthropology to sociology) or even to one in a different college(ex sociology to animal science) is possible/not too difficult. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s more difficult to switch majors at slo, and was wondering if this is true.",

            "comment": "It is possible. I wouldn\u2019t call it hard necessarily, but you have to demonstrate that you are really committed. You can\u2019t switch until you\u2019ve completed at least one quarter in your admitted major, and I believe it takes three quarters under \u201ccontract\u201d to officially switch. It\u2019s generally much easier to switch within your college, but it is possible to switch into a different college as long as it isn\u2019t a closed major (like computer science). Basically, you have to have a certain GPA to enter a major switch contract and you have to maintain an adequate GPA and some other requirements while you complete the contract.",

After that one quarter you're in the new major. It's not too bad for staying in a college but swapping colleges has much steeper requirements",

            "comment": "I have a friend who enrolled in CLA and tried to switch into mathematics. After two quarters trying to demonstrate an ability to succeed in the target major (which included enrolling in highly impacted classes without the support of the math department or the privileged enrollment that comes with that support), he finally got an ICMA, which then required two more quarters of taking math major courses without the benefits of being a math major. \nAlternately, another of my friends switched from the college of engineering to biology and was able to make that switch in under a year. \nSo, it is possible but if you\u2019re trying to switch between colleges and/or switch into more impacted majors, it can be quite a few hoops to jump through.",

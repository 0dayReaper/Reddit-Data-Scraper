            "comment": "If you're going to do it fulltime before transferring, I would approach it differently compared to doing it during the summer in addition to Cal Poly the rest of the year. I did it over the sumner only and it really helps to only do one or two at a time because it really makes any class an easy A when you have that much time to dedicate to it and that helps your cumulative GPA and you can still have a fun summer that way. \n\nIf you're thinking about taking Cuesta GEs during the quarter while you're taking major courses at CP, wouldn't do that cuz the risk outweighs the reward and that's a really inconvenient strategy.\n\nMost important thing is obviously class selection. At least at Foothill Community College, every class in the catalog will have a marker that says if it counts for CSUs or UCs. If it doesn't count for a CSU, don't take it. Also look at the Cal Poly offerings to see if there are any GEs you wouldn't mind taking there and do those last. Psych stood out as a cool GE I took here. Also check Polyratings while you're doing that. I ended up taking Philosophy at community because only a couple sections a quarter in those GEs don't suck and you probably won't get in those good ones unless you have a registration advantage. Also don't forget to send your official transcript over afterwards or CP won't know you did them. Your Poly Profile will be less accurate for a while after until the system processes your transcripts, so keep track for yourself of what your degree progress is on your major flowchart.\n\nOverall just don't think you're a big shot and forget to take your GEs seriously. In the end they count almost the same as of you were taking it at CP, so the weight is similar (unless you really want to just never tell CP you took it because you failed, but then you're just wasting your own time) and you still should work on building a relationship with your professor and get along with some classmates in case you need help or need bodies for a group project. You'll also need to find something fulfilling to do on the side just like if you were taking classes anywhere else so think about that when building your schedule. A lot of people get discouraged taking CC courses since it can be more isolating than CP, so do what you can to stay motivated.\n\nDon't forget to take advantage of the time you're saving by researching what fun classes you can take to fill your CP schedule, Minors you might be interested in picking up, or what you need to do to graduate early if that's your thing.",

That might require an appeal or something tho. I think you can also add schools to your FAFSA later as long as you file it before the deadline originally, but it could take a while to update. I've never done that tho",

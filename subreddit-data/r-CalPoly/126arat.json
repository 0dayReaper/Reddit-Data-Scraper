    "postText": "Hi! I am wondering if anyone has ever crashed an online class and how you went about it? I am first on the waitlist for an online class, and it would be super helpful if I could get into it as it\u2019s a prerequisite for another class. I am hoping to see if anyone has ever emailed a prof about getting the zoom link if they\u2019re on the waitlist. Thank you!",

Socialism requires some element of worker control of the means of production. Welfare-state capitalism is not socialism of any kind. It is a bizarre belief that Americans associate regulations and welfare with socialism, when neither is the case.\n\nI\u2019d also challenge the idea that any of the Nordic states have *more* regulations than the United States. This is mostly a misconception. Denmark\u2019s labour markets are far less regulated. All the Nordic countries rank higher than the US on ease-of-doing business lists. Sweden has mostly private roads.\n\n&gt;which is probably why you can count the parent company list of major competitors for most of the common things that people consume and places where the vast majority of the population work here on one hand.\n\nThe largest US company is Walmart, which employs around 1% of the population. The largest Swedish company is Securitas AB, which employs 2% of their population. The largest company in Finland is Nokia, which also employs around 2% of the population. Frankly, I don\u2019t think your claim of American exceptionalism has much merit here. The US is a fairly average country when it comes to the size of corporations.\n\nNot to mention that, if you really do like socialism, most socialist doctrine generally prefers larger companies, as they are easier to nationalize and regulate. Even in the US, larger companies pay more, are subject to mote stringent regulations, and generally have better benefits. \n\nOf course monopolies have their risks\u2014but again, this is not a socialist claim, but a capitalist one.",

It was conquered by Russia from Sweden in the early 19th century, existed as a semi-autonomous duchy ruled by thr Tsar as a constitutional monarch, and gained independence from Russia during the 1917 Russian revolutions.\n\nFinland\u2019s declaration of independence from Russian was promulgated by Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, a conservative anti-socialist nationalist. The Finns then had a civil war in which the anti-socialist \u201cwhites\u201d definitively won.\n\n&gt;While you could say that the Nordic model has privatized and deregulated a good portion of what was set up by the founders, \n\nAgain, who are these mythical founders? \n\nThe Nordic were never socialist, and ironically much of the so-called Nordic model emerged from the \u201cortholiberal\u201d wing of the Mont Pelerin Society, famously also the origin of neoliberalism.\n\n&gt;1% of the United States is about 60% the population of Finland. We are talking about apples and oranges here comparing populations and where they work. \n\nI fail to see how this matters in any way. If you think it is acceptable to make comparisons to small countries, then you should do so on a proportional level. \n\n&gt;30% of Fins work for the federal government in publicly funded departments or programs while only 15% of Americans do. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure what you think this proves, as this is almost exactly what is expected from a country which has a public health care and education system.\n\n&gt;Throw in universal basic income and guaranteed universal healthcare and you've got a robust social safety net that would throw the Republican party in the United States into convulsions. \n\nFinland does not have a UBI.  Nor is universal healthcare socialist lmao. Finland does have a *socialized healthcare system*, akin to the VA, which is socialist. \n\nYou seem to also be double-counting here. Finland has high public sector employment only because it directly hires healthcare workers through taxation. 410,000 people in Finland work in healthcare, essentially making up the entire 10% difference between the United States\u2019 17.3% public sector employment and Finland\u2019s 27%. There are a similar fraction of workers employed in American healthcare (18 million), where around 40% of costs are covered by the US federal government medicare and medicaid programs.\n\nhttps://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nhe-fact-sheet\n\nYou also seem to be operating under the idea that the Republicans are honest when they call something \u201csocialist.\u201d \n\nAgain, welfare and universal healthcare are not socialist ideas. Imperial Germany was the first country to institute government-subsidized healthcare under the conservative government of Otto von Bismarck.\n\n&gt;Monopolies do have risks, especially when they can buy elections and align the government with their fascist goals.\n\nLmao. This is deranged conspiracy thinking.\n\nFirst, you can\u2019t actually buy elections. Despite what people believe, study after study has shown that funding has negligible effects on outcomes. \n\nSecond, corporations are not fascist. In fact, most support Democrats. There\u2019s a reason Republicans are fuming about \u201cwoke corporations,\u201d though they are equally stupid in believing that corporate money matters.\nhttps://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/03/one-billion-dark-money-2020-electioncycle/\n\n3) Total election spending in the US was around $14 billion in 2020, not including around $1-2 billion in dark money. The federal government\u2019s budget last year was $6.27 trillion. Let\u2019s round up enormously and say $20 billion was spent on elections. This would still only be 0.32% of all federal spending\u2014and most of that came from individual donors. Corporations have spent only a few hundred million dollars on elections in the past decade. This is chump change, and if the government was up for purchase, it wouldn\u2019t cost less than Boeing makes in a year.\n\nThe real danger of monopoly is market saturation leading to reduced wages or inferior products. Neither has been observed by economists at a large scale, though local monopsony does exist, especially in rural areas and states.",

I can see that you got your PhD. in Googling counter-arguments that support your personal opinion and creating equivalencies to try to prove your point, not that I'm doing anything substantially different. I never said that \"corporations\" were inherently fascist though; I said that \"monopolies\" were.\n\n Election donations are not the whole story, you would do well to also include the lobby relationship and revolving door between the financial, pharmaceutical, and defense industries, to name just a few, and Congress.  You also forgot to mention the utter destruction of media regulation due to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, thanks to Pres. Bill Clinton, that gave centralized corporate control of the entire nation's information supply to a handful of companies.  We already have the kind of market saturation and inferior products that you mention due to monopolization and globalization and we are on track for the next phase, which is probably something similar to what Russia has going on (a facade of (ironically propagandized as soccialist) government operating under the orders of elite oligarchy who privately own nearly the entire country's assets) than pure fascism, though if you look back in history, Nazi sympathizers in modern industrial America who hated unions like Henry Ford are not hard to find. The fanboys of his Machiavellian approach to productivity litter the boardrooms of corporate America and the halls of Congress today.  And yes, the Democrats are equally culpable in this dynamic, as politics for the masses is largely an illusion to protect the heirarchy of ownership of wealth in the United States, as it has pretty much always been. As far as health care is concerned, it's hard to argue that health insurance is under any condition an ethical business model or that the largely unregulated level of care that is under federal subsidy (Medicaid) anywhere near the standard of care in most other developed nations, so the comparison of subsidized healthcare to the public sector of other countries is utter nonsense.",

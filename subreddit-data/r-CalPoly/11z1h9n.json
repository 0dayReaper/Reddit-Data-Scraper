    "postText": "I wanted to ask some questions about Cal Poly, both academically and socially, as I am having trouble deciding between Cal Poly and UCSB. First,\n\nI was accepted to slo for stats and UCSB for stats and data science. I haven't heard great things about UCSB's stats department, but I have heard amazing things about slo's stats dept. Can anybody give me insight into slo's stats program (and the college of mathematics and sciences as a whole)? I also know I shouldn't tunnel vision too much on my major, because I'll prob change my mind, but I love math and cs.\n\nSecond,\n\nI am an avid surfer and backpacker/camper/hiker, so I love Slo (the town and school). I am also familiar with the area, having camped &amp; surfed Pismo, Avila Beach, Morro Bay, and Big Sur &gt;10 times. I am from CA (orange county)  and love the rural-ish feel of and around slo, as well as just the Central Coast in general. However, I also love SB's campus and all it and IV have to offer. I know that the waves are better at slo (sb is good like twice a year) and that my hiking and camping obsession will be satiated. \n\nFinally, Do any of you have tips for how you arrived at your college decision or for choosing between two schools you love? Did anyone choose Slo over SB, and why? I am really happy to have this dilemma, but it's also scary because it's so hard to say no to one of these schools! Thank you for reading this far, I really appreciate any and all answers!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/11z1h9n)",

            "comment": "Cal Poly 100%. I have quite a few friends in the stats department here in who love the environment in the major. Plus, IV doesn\u2019t honestly have as much to offer as SLO. It\u2019s a lot bigger of a city &amp; definitely a lot more of a rough environment. SLO is super close to so many hiking trails and even if it\u2019s not ON the beach it\u2019s so close to many beaches (less than 20 minute drive) - and these beaches are way less packed/touristy than the ones in SB. From what you\u2019ve included in your post I\u2019d definitely say you prefer the SLO environment more than the UC - there\u2019s so many clubs and events celebrating the environment or people that want to go out and hike. I see people with hammocks up all the time on campus. \n\nAlso, the UC system is genuinely just worse than the CSU. Out of my HS friend group, all of them but me went to a UC. They are paying significantly higher tuition than I am, and in addition, have far more trouble registering for classes than I do because of how big their schools are &amp; how many students try to get into one class. The overall school system at CP is definitely a lot better handled. I\u2019ve also heard that my friends don\u2019t like how the dining hall works at SB - here places like Jamba juice and Subway are included in your dining plans, it\u2019s not like that at SB. \n\nFinally - I chose CP over SB and it was such an easy choice for me. It\u2019s far less expensive, and the learn by doing approach is honestly just great - it\u2019s actually put more in action than you\u2019d really think it would be. My friends at UCs just read books and stuff whereas we actually are able to put whatever we\u2019ve learned in action. \n\nWhile I\u2019m not in COSAM, from the perspective of an outsider the school is hugely supportive (if not the most supportive compared to the other colleges) of COSAM. There\u2019s many help sessions and a boat load of resources specific to the college. Also, they got shirts at orientation and no other college did LOL \n\nTLDR - the environment in SLO is so much better. I\u2019ve heard a LOT of very bad things about living in IV, especially if you like to go out a lot - IVPD is intense and a lot of people from UCSB come up here to party on big weekends. The school system is a lot more complicated at UCSB because of how many students there are - you might feel alienated or like you have little help at UCSB because there\u2019s so many more students to account for. \n\nI think by your post you\u2019re leaning towards SLO\u2026. there\u2019s quite a few benefits to choosing SLO over UCSB, especially as a COSAM student/stats major.",

I'd just say, your living situation in SB will be much more precarious and expensive than SLO. Neither are cheap, but even just GETTING housing in SB/IV/Goleta is a challenge, then the cost itself is a whole other story. \n\nThat being said, the Santa Barbara area has more to offer with stuff to do from hikes, the beach, restaurants, events, etc. But I wouldn't say SLO lacks in the events or hiking options, but the food and general stuff to do is lacking.",

UCs are more research oriented IMO, better chance you can become a Stats professor. Cal Poly has a higher chance of prepping you for real life jobs. Just my humble opinion. Also great hiking is way more accessible in SLO.",

Cal poly has a great CS program, but definitely not the same level of prestige as Berkeley CS. There is definitely more on campus recruiting from top companies at Berkeley and more opportunities in start ups. \n\nCulturally, slo is a lot more laid back and less competitive. Friends of mine at Berkeley have said that everything is very cut throat and competitive. \n\nCal will probably be about 10k more a year. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of other factors so feel free to ask any questions. I would personally go to Berkeley, but I have no major complaints about cal poly and haven\u2019t struggled to get good internships.",

I would take a Cal Poly student over a Berkley student almost every time. Cal Poly students consistently have more real-world software skills than their UC counterparts. Generally, Cal Poly gets students coding much earlier and that translates into higher likelihood of getting good internships which then builds the skills needed to get a full-time job after graduation.\n\nThat said, if your son is motivated and passionate about software, he can succeed at either school. Kids who are willing to go the extra mile and tackle projects outside of their normal coursework will always have a leg up. If you think your son is more likely to just stick to coursework (which is totally fine!) then they'll be better equipped coming out of Cal Poly than Berkley.",

Cal poly doesn\u2019t offer PhDs so it\u2019s not ranked among these schools. \n\nAlso I think you\u2019re underestimating cs at calpoly too. Berkeley is most definitely better but cal poly is still very very solid and sure people across the nation like in the east coast won\u2019t know calpoly but recruiters in California most certainly will. You got some employers actually prefer cal poly over many UC schools and calpoly is probably around mid UC tier level for cs.\n\n\nEdit: I reread the link you linked but lmao that ranking is pretty laughable. You literally got schools like riverside over Pomona college and Claremont McKenna which are both very very solid schools and most certainly better than riverside. If it\u2019s really by descending order I\u2019m sorry but that list is a joke",

Yeah, yak\u0294it\u02b8ut\u02b8u is nice but I highly recommend choosing an RLC you are actually interested in. The people you\u2019re living around is more important than the location - all of the buildings have pros and cons. (From an RA)",

Ppl in red bricks have their issues but love it too. There are so many pros and cons to each but it\u2019s really what you make of it.\nI do recommend living with people if your major/college unless you want to be in pride or another community rlc.

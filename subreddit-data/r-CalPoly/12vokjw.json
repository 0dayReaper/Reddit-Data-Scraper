            "comment": "Calpoly also covers differential and linear, i could tell you that it is very easy, but its all objective. For me i thought linear algebra and differential equations separately was very straightforward and on the easier side, definitely not anywhere near as hard as any calc class. It all depends on what you want, in person or online.",

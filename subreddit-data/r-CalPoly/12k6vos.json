Il check out your other comments but it\u2019s good to hear the requirements for transferring intra-engineering is accurate! Thank you so much!",

It gives you a very broad education, so it will allow me to work in more fields and figure out what I really want to do in life. I also was intrigued by the Energy Resources concentration for ME. I\u2019m more interested in the design side of things as opposed to the regulation side of things.",

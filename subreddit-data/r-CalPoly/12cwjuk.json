    "postText": "Yesterday, while rushing across campus during the noon passing period, I overheard someone manning a Dexter booth claim, \u201cthe Donbas is ethnically Russian anyway.\u201d It took me a second to process this peculiar statement, such that I didn\u2019t stop to get the context, or sourcing for the claim. It\u2019s generally not my business to butt in and argue international relations with strangers, so I figured highlighting the claim here would have more impact than arguing with someone already tapped into a disinformation source.\n\nAside from the last six centuries of conquest, colonization and oppression of the Russian Empire, Stalin committed two atrocities relevant to this argument which I assume was excusing ethnic cleansing in the current Russian invasion of Ukraine. The 1932 Holodomor killed and starved over 3 million Ukrainians with follow on Russification efforts to stamp out Ukrainian language and culture. In 1944, after two centuries of Russian occupation of Crimea, the remaining Crimean Tatars were rounded up and shipped east on trains with follow on colonization by the Soviet empire\u2019s preferred ethnic group. So yes, there\u2019s historical reasons to explain why minority ethnic groups find themselves within the borders of another nation, but that doesn\u2019t excuse war.\n\nMy great grandparents fled military conscription from a country occupied by the Russian Empire. Putin, a petty tyrant with the czar\u2019s crest on his imperial palace, is likewise conscripting Chechens, Muslims, and other minorities in Russia as cannon fodder to achieve his goal of ethnic cleansing across Russian and Ukrainian borders.\n\nPassing along Russian disinformation promotes complicity in ongoing genocide; hopefully this propaganda isn\u2019t going far.",

Recently, more officials admit the Minsk Treaty was just a \\[ploy to give the Ukraine time to build up for a war with Russia\\].   \nThe constant expansion of NATO is what caused this war. Russia wanted Ukraine to remain neutral. It was their sphere of influence, not ours or the West, and that's what the entire Minsk treaty was about.   \n\n\nWhile I don't necessarily agree with the invasion, they were leaving Russia with hardly any options, even lying to them regarding peace agreements, and inserting \"nationalist/Banderist\" regiments that are literal Neo-Nazis such as Azov Battalion (I can show you camps where kids sig-heil in the Ukraine if you like)..\n\nThere is way more going onto this than Americans think..  Also, do we really have any moral high-ground after invading Iraq on totally fake \"WMD\" pretext and killing a million Iraqis?",

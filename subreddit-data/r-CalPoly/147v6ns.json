    "postText": "Hey Cal Poly!\n\nAbout 9 months ago, [we launched Ryde](https://www.rydecarpool.com/about) to make sharing a ride a normal means of travel for our Cal Poly community (we're students + alumni). Since then we've facilitated 600,000+ miles of travel and have helped drivers recoup $60,000+ in gas!\n\nWe're now expanding to another university and are hiring for various positions both here at Cal Poly and down south at UC Santa Barbara. If you're interested in learning more or you have a friend that might be interested please share our jobs board with them or reach out so we can chat.\n\n[Jobs board here!](https://johnnymorris.notion.site/Ryde-Job-Board-341ef4b253674968962b45827d495d68)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest,  \nJohnny\n\nCo-Founder - Ryde",

Do you check their DMV record and/or do a criminal background check? What training or safety requirements are in place for the drivers and their vehicles? What kind of liability insurance does Ryde carry for drivers/riders?\n\nIt's a really cool idea.",

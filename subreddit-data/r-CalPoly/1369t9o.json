    "postText": "Hello! Ive applied to housing already as an individual (everyone I know is going to CSUSB :( ) and my 2 rlc preferences are CP Scholars and then CENG. I know that a spot at CP Scholars is basically guaranteed. The little questions I have are : \n\n1) would you suggest looking for roommates? what are the chances of getting a roommate I dont like? Any experiences you guys can share?\n\n2) is there still a chance i can get into the CENG rlc (im a cs major so maybe it would help to be with engineering kids)\n\n3) are the cp scholars requirements difficult to meet? \n\n4) are cp scholars dorms in yak?",

It's absolutely luck of the draw, do with that information what you will.\n2. If you're in CP Scholars then you'll have to live in the scholars RLC, it's one of the scholarship requirments. That doesn't mean that you wont be living with other engineers, and as far as I know it doesn't make all that much of a difference for most people.\n3. The scholars requirements are generally super easy to meet, just keep your grades at a reasonable level. The scholars office will also help you out if you're struggling. \n4. You should be able to find rlc placements online sometime pretty soon. They don't like to release official first year housing placements until most people have done their housing application so that people don't choose rlc's based on which building they want to live in. Scholars this year were spread throughout a few different dorms, not just ytt.",

You don't really want to take the chance of getting a random one because you might not connect with them at all. But on the other hand, you might meet someone with new interests and make a new friend. If you want to look for roommates, you can use an app called [DormMe](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dormme/id1671377025). It's exclusive to Cal Poly students at the moment.",

I was an RA and found that some of the best advice was just letting people know there's a way out if it goes south.\n\nWe always told people to try and find a solution first. You don't have to be friends with your roommate you just need to respect eachothers space. If it continues to be a serious problem, housing will let you move to a different room/building.",

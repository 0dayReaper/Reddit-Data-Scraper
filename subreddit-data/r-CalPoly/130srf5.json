    "postText": "Was accepted, but before committing, would like to know any downsides, or reasons why people left the program.    \n\nThe requirements don\u2019t sound too onerous, and I\u2019m hoping the dorm environment will be less crazy.   Question: does honors housing extend beyond year 2?   \n\nI learned that it does not grant priority enrollment after year 2, which was one of the main benefits i thought it came with.\n\nThanks for the feedback.",

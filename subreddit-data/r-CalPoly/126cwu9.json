Passing a class (most of the time) isn\u2019t too difficult, you just have to work to get good grades. It also varies a lot by Professor tbh. You\u2019ll get a large range of difficult classes at cal poly, so it\u2019s kinda hard to give a concrete answer",

For that I would say it really depends, even among public schools there is such a range of competitiveness among high schools.\n\nI haven\u2019t taken an actual history class test, but from my experience I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be too much harder. GEs so far have been much easier than my AP classes in hs, and liberal arts major classes about the same as APs. Further down the line though, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll become more difficult.",

That said, my profs have been very good- they just expect a lot more than an HS teacher would. \n\nYou will have moments of felling real stressed when you slip up and have to try and recover your grade, but it'll be all the more satisfying when everything works out in the end.",

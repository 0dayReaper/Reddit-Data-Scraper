    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m an incoming transfer student from a Community College and just was wondering how early I should start looking for a job before Fall Quarter since I\u2019m a server currently and would prefer to work in a restaurant still on the weekends. Should I just save my money this summer from my current job and enjoy my first quarter up here? \n\nThanks for looking!",

But if you can't, you should probably start trying to look for jobs now. I think Chipotle is hiring.",

I\u2019m an aerospace engineering student and I\u2019ve taken statics, dynamics, circuits, and materials science so far all while working my job as a server only 2 days on the weekend at my community college, which is sufficient enough for me to spend time to get decent money for how much I realistically could do with my academics. I think I\u2019m gonna check it out (job market wise) but also I\u2019m trying to just let myself adjust to the entire quarter system coming from a semester based CC.",

            "comment": "I think it depends on your major and how fast you plan to graduate. If you're a ME trying to graduate in 2 years after transferring (like I did) then there isn't much time for work outside of studying and networking. But if you draw that out to 3 years I think there's enough time to work a job. Really depends on you and your plan\n\nI'm of the trial by fire mentality: go all in, and adjust your habits to the load you give yourself (or drop classes if your load is too heavy). The ME courses build on each other, and seemed like a continual ramp up in difficulty (with a lot of fluctuation based on instructor), so the best time to see if you'll have time to work a job is when the going is the lightest. If you're not taking a bunch of weeder classes, that would be as soon as you get here.",

I\u2019m only looking for something on the weekends (Friday and Saturday) so I could serve those nights and focus on my academics the rest of the week. I\u2019ve been taking some of the weeder courses at my community college (statics, dynamics, circuits, and material science) all while working my current restaurant job on the weekends. I know it\u2019s going to be an adjustment for the quarter system and I don\u2019t want to get destroyed so I am going to continue thinking about what my options are as I do have a car payment since my mom is a single parent and I\u2019m a first gen so I have to have some income to support myself.",

I didn't think that the jump from semesters to quarters was too much to worry about, but maybe that's bc K-12 was on the quarter system. During cc I was always checked out by week 12, so CP's 10 week courses are just right. \n\nIt doesn't seem like they're taking a semester's worth of material and cramming it into 10 weeks; the classes are a little more bite sized (still fast paced tho). Also if your finals are cumulative, you're only being tested on the last 10 weeks instead of like 16.",

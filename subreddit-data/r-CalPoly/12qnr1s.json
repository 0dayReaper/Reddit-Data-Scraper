    "postText": "hey everyone, Im an Australian uni student looking at doing exchange to the US next year, one of the colleges I\u2019m considering is Cal Poly. I just have some questions i was hoping to get answered. Thank you in advance :)\n\n1. Is CalPoly socially dead?\n\n2. How close to good surf beaches is the campus, would it be easy for a student to travel with their board to the beach without a car?\n\n3. Is it more of a commuter college or do most people live on/near the campus?\n\n4. Is it easy to travel from the campus to other areas of San Luis Obispo without a car?\n\n5. What is San Luis Obispo like as a city?\n\n6. When would be the best time to come? 1st or 2nd semester\n\n7. Is there any other CSU campus\u2019s you would recommend?\n\nEdit: Sorry for taking so long to reply! thank you all for the responses it's been very helpful in making my decision!! :)",

The beaches are ~15 minutes driving away, might be tricky to get there without a car.\n\n3. Most people live on the north end of town but there are some commuters (mostly upperclassmen).\n\n4. The bus system is free for students, covers most areas of town, and runs pretty constantly. It's very easy to get downtown without a car.\n\n5. It's not a huge city (so people from huge metro areas often complain that there's nothing to do), but it's a fun city with plenty to do if you make an effort. There's a strong sense of community, even if there's a bit of a divide between the college part of town and the 'locals'.\n\n6. Cal Poly uses a quarter system (for now); I'm not sure how that lines up with semesters but try to be here for part of spring/summer (April - July).\n\n7. I haven't set foot on another CSU campus since committing to SLO back in high school; can't really give a current rec.",

San Diego State and Long Beach State are also a few miles from the beach but have an active number of surfer students. You\u2019ll probably want to lease a car while here to make the best use of your time.",

If you get involved in clubs, usually there are enough drivers for you to make friends and get them to drive you places for unrelated errands etc. If you're walking you'll be inconvenienced, but I've walked all the way across SLO in about 2 hours with a backpack and that would be impossible where I grew up",

            "comment": "&gt;Is CalPoly socially dead? \n\nDefinitely not. However, it can be hard to find your scene in a short period of time. Join a fraternity/sorority or some of our many clubs to find people to hang out and party with.\n\n&gt;How close to good surf beaches is the campus, would it be easy for a student to travel with their board to the beach without a car? \n\nThere are good surfing beaches within around a 25 minute drive from campus in multiple directions. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to do much in the Central Coast region without a car. Others may be able to discuss what public transit is useful. I believe there are buses that run every 30 minutes or so between SLO and Morro Bay, but I do not know how easy it is to bring your surfboard.\n\n&gt;Is it more of a commuter college or do most people live on/near the campus? \n\nThe vast majority of people live on or near campus, though people tend to move further away as the get older.\n\n&gt;Is it easy to travel from the campus to other areas of San Luis Obispo without a car? \n\nWithin the city there is a bus, but I would not call it easy to use. The city is very spread out and buses run somewhat infrequently, as it is a small town.\n\n&gt;What is San Luis Obispo like as a city? \n\nIt's a fairly typical small town, somewhat charming in looks, with nice people, but also somewhat boring. There is plenty of beautiful nature, however, even if events are somewhat sparse.\n\n&gt;When would be the best time to come? 1st or 2nd semester \n\nCal Poly is a quarter system until 2025 at least. I have no idea what to do about semesters if you are coming after 2025, and I don't think the particular quarter you come matters. \n\n&gt;Is there any other CSU campus\u2019s you would recommend?\n\nSorry, no experience. You might consider San Diego if you're interested in surfing though.",

From my experience of living in the building with other exchange students from different countries, they find friends fast. \n\nExchange students are able to rent the zip cars we have on campus. My roommate uses her international license (idk if you can get that in AU). The zip car is essentially a car rental for college students and the cars are on campus. Or maybe if you have a roommate that has a car they can take you as well.",

            "comment": "SLO is a great place and pretty laid back. Cal Poly does have a surf club you should look into. You can also easily take a bus to morro bay and get near the Rock, a local favorite, with your board. My buddy did it twice a week for years. Cayucos also isn't hard to get to. People trash our public transportation, but it's actually pretty good. I also frequently see a car full of students and a roof full of surfboards head to the beach. It helps having a bike in SLO though. Everything is a short bike ride away.",

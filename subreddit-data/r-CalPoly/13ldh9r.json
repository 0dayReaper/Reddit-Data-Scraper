The options are ES 252-256",

            "comment": "Hey ! I took ES 255 with \"Buend\u00eda de Llaca, Yanitsa\" spring 2022. I ended up with an A-. Had class 2x a week for 2 hours, but there were times where we left an hour early. Class was mainly just showing up and taking notes on her lecture slides. She assigns weekly reading but I got by just taking notes about her slides, since they were similar. Downside is she wouldn't post her slides online after. The class made a mass group chat so that was really beneficial. If you want to know more, pm me. I think I still have access to her syllabus. But overall, pretty good choice for an ES.",

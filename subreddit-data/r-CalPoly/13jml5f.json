    "postText": "I know that transferring from CSU to CSU typically require gpa's above 3.0(the requirement is 2.0, but actual transfers all have above 3.0), and this expectation is lowered for CC to CSU(I see individuals with gpa's of 2.3 getting in). What about if I transferred from a CSU to a CC, and then that CC to Cal Poly. Does anyone know whether or not the expectation will still be as high?",

    "postText": "Hi Guys,\nSo I've been set on going to Cal Poly as a transfer student for Business Administration. I visited the campus last month and I really liked it and I really liked the area as well. However, I also got into ucsd for Busines Economics and while Cal Poly is a great school, I wonder if I would be making a mistake by turning down ucsd due to the prestige that it has.",

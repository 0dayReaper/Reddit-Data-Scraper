    "postText": "So I took a class last quarter and got a C+ in the class. I did VERY poorly on the final and had the class not been curved, I probably would have received a D or D+. I had some genuine family reasons that made it difficult to do well in that course, and I have no doubt in my mind that I will do better the second time around. I also want to apply to graduate school, which may explain why I'm so worried about my grades.   \n\n\nCan I ask my professor to essentially curve me down so that I am eligible for grade forgiveness, but still pass the course so that I can move forward in my studies? If so, how would you even make a request like that?",

Take the C+ and keep chugging. One C won\u2019t completely ruin your GPA but if you get Fs and have maxed out on grade forgiveness, they will really hurt your GPA",

There\u2019s a group paper with a presentation at the end, and a smaller group presentation. \nGrading I think was very fair, I got an A in the course. Class was 95% lecture slides and her lecturing. The content isn\u2019t super easy since law is often new and unfamiliar. Keep up with the reading and ask her questions. She\u2019s so eager and passionate.",

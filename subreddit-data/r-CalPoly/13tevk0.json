    "postText": "Im a freshman coming into cal poly this fall and I was wondering about what kind of things are needed/good to have and what things you really don\u2019t need. (I\u2019m in engineering so I\u2019ll probably be in north mountain). One of the main things I was wondering about is a printer. How much do you usually use it, like do you turn most assignments in online or on paper? Should my roommates and I get one or will we be fine with just using the school\u2019s printers ?",

            "comment": "Printer is nice to have but not 100% necessary. You will inevitably have to print things but someone's always got one you can use, or use the schools. An important item is a large box fan or floor fan because it can get hot in the dorms in the summer and it really helps to move the air around.",

Most assignments are turned in online, and if it\u2019s something you need to hand in (like math homework) you\u2019re usually doing it by hand anyway. I can\u2019t stress a fan enough, you will want at least one but probably multiple (I recommend a small one for your desk and a larger one to put by the window). Beyond that, bring a shower caddy and SHOWER SHOES - as an RA you would not believe how many people I see that don\u2019t wear shower shoes and I beseech you, please wear shower shoes. You will also probably want a mattress topper, the dorm mattresses are fine but not super comfortable.",

    "postText": "I recently applied to become a lead for the Google Student Developer Club, with the aim of bringing this it to our campus. The application process involves multiple stages, and I have successfully passed the initial screening. I now have a video interview remaining to complete the process. Before proceeding to schedule the interview, I wanted to gauge if there is anyone else who might be interested in joining this club. It would be great to have an idea of how many are actually interested before going through this process. If you are interested, please let me know. Would love to hear some feedback. This club would be open to all majors also.\n\nGoogle Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) are student-led communities within universities that focus on learning and collaboration in the field of technology, specifically Google technologies. GDSCs offer workshops, training sessions, and mentorship programs conducted by industry professionals and Google experts. They organize events like hackathons and coding competitions, providing students with opportunities to enhance their skills and network with peers. Joining a GDSC allows students to develop technical and leadership skills, build a professional network, and gain exposure to industry opportunities, preparing them for careers in the tech industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**: I applied to lead the Google Student Developer Club on our campus.

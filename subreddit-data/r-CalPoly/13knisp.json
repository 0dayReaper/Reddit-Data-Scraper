    "postText": "I recently got accepted into UCLA and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo for Electrical Engineering, but I cannot decide which one to choose. I am a transfer student from a California community college.\n\nCal Poly has their Learn By Doing philosophy which I know will be very beneficial in terms of finding a job and getting out into the real world, however, anything outside of their engineering program is just a little bit worse than UCLA. In terms of housing, food, location, social life.\n\nAt UCLA, their engineering program is much lower ranked and it seems like I would have to look outside of the already rigorous curriculum to get any hands-on experience. However, they are offering a 2-year guarantee for housing which means that if I get in this year, I'll be set until I graduate. They also have their dining halls which I've heard is one of the best and it means that I don't have to worry about food while attending there. Also, the social life at UCLA seems to be much better with better sports and social gatherings. \n\nI understand that as an EE major, I won't have much time to do any extracurricular stuff but it's good to know that I have something to do and experience the \"college life\" any chance I get. PLEASE HELP!!!",

            "comment": "EE alum here.  \n\nUCLA and Cal Poly are very different schools. Given EE is not an easy major, you should put yourself in a living/learning environment that will maximize your chance of academic success while having a solid college experience.  \n\nAnd because these schools are so different, it will come down to your own personality, learning style, values, and overall lifestyle preferences. Choose the school that fits you as a person, not just for the academics. \n\nCal Poly is located in a true college town and so there is a strong sense of college community in SLO. I wouldn't say Cal Poly's social scene is inferior to UCLA's. Rather it is just different, much in the same way, Westwood is located in an urban center and Cal Poly is located in a picturesque small city near some of the best beaches in CA. And because CP is not a big sports school, most students will end up getting involved in things such as clubs, outdoor sports (surfing, hiking, biking etc.) \n\nWith respect to academics, be aware that UCLA EE will be harder than Cal Poly because the engineering students are more competitive and more academically inclined. Also, UCLA math/engineering classes will be bigger. In addition to going to regular engineering lectures, you will have to attend recitations taught by TAs (this is for the TAs to answer questions you might not have a chance to ask during lectures). The approach to teaching will be much more theoretically oriented simply because both your professors and TAs are research-focused Phds/soon-to-be-Phds.   \n\nCal Poly will be easier in terms of academic rigor. The professors will be more accessible and the overall program is geared toward practical applications of engineering and less focus on theories (e.g. proofs). Your fellow students will be more laid back and more collaborative but you might learn less from them than at UCLA. Again, if you prefer theories over more practical application-focused, and you prefer learning in a more competitive environment, you will fare better at UCLA. \n\nBoth UCLA and Cal Poly are great schools. Pick the one that suits your learning style and lifestyle. And if you really can't decide and you are paralyzed over the decision, I would go with UCLA Engineering because it is a nationally much better-known program than Cal Poly. \n\nFYI, I did my graduate school at Harvard and Stanford after Poly. I was very glad I didn't attend those schools for my undergrad. I would have easily flunked out of both.",

This is actually incomplete. \n\nMy advice to you on achieving career success would be:\n\nFigure out what you are good at (hard or soft skills or both) as soon as humanly possible (this will save you lots of wasted time) \n    \nFigure out what you are passionate about and make sure you are REALLY good at that passion (ie your passion needs to intersect with your skills/gifts) \n    \nMake sure the economics is right: i.e. make sure what you are good at AND passionate about pays well \n\nMake sure your future career is the intersection of those 3 attributes (think Venn diagram). \n  \nI know figuring out what you're good at and what you're passionate about can take a long time. For most people, they actually never figure it out. \n  \nThe key is getting to know yourself really well. It might sound obvious, but most people don't know themselves. Otherwise, Socrates would not have said, \"A life unexamined is not worth living.\" You must learn to be your own best friend.   \n\nRegarding figuring out what you are good at, in case you're not having luck on that front, you can do the opposite. Figure out what you are bad at and stay away from those areas. You can only strengthen your weaknesses so much, whereas, you can go very far in strengthening your strengths.  \n\nOne last thing.   \n  \nYour superpower should be GRIT. Not IQ, money, looks, education, connections, etc. GRIT, never give up. I've friends who were Navy Seals, and they all agreed that GRIT is more important than anything else in succeeding at a world-class elite level. \n\nHope this helps you.",

To your point of finding what you're good at (and then alternatively avoiding what you're bad at), what would you do if you're reasonably good in all subjects...\n\nThere are absolutely better students than me in every subject, and I'm definitely not a genius, but I'm also not especially bad at anything. Generally with little to no effort I can get a B at Cal Poly, and with moderate effort an A is achievable. I'm taking 24 units right now at Cal Poly and while I don't have all As (I'm averaging B+ across all 6 classes) beyond required assignments I don't study at all.\n\nI could then consider which subjects come easier to me, but its quite hard to measure when various subjects have varying rigor involved (Calculus will almost always be more challenging/require more effort compared to an English class). Not to say English is easy, but it is generally easier so comparing classes based on how much effort is put in could be a bit inaccurate since subjects aren't at the same level of intensity.\n\nI'm not saying these things out of arrogance, but simply because I am genuinely lost in what I actually want to do with my life. You refer to passion, but frankly I don't think I'm passionate in any specific subject. I think there are aspects of various subjects that are interesting to me, but similarly all of those subjects contain aspects that are unappealing. i find it hard to distinguish between whether an interest should be developed into a hobby or a future career.\n\nEdit: To put it simply, how did you figure it out?",

So as a transfer I found myself two years behind from the start.  Not sure if UCLA is the same but it is something to be aware of.\n\nThat said I would definitely recommend Cal Poly!  I have worked with a lot of different engineers and some are really brilliant but you hand them any electronics and they give you a blank stare.  They know the fundamentals but lack the hands on experience.\n\nHaving Cal Poly on my resume definitely seems to have helped.",

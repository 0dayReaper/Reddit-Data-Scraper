The other two are lab heavy. Do not take 412 (GI) unless you would like to spend 10 weeks not actually learning anything at all. I didn't take neuro or muscles but the only things Ive heard about those is its a lot of info. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for upper division anatomy profs, Lema and Strand are the best that I've had.",

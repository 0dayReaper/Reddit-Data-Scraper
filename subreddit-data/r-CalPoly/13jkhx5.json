With that said, you should try to separate the project into chunks (I.e. components). \n\nAnother thing is to make sure you have 2-4 hours allotted every time you work on something. Once you get in the groove of things, you\u2019ll start to output code much more quickly. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, working on projects is a skill you\u2019ll be working on your entire career - don\u2019t feel bad if you\u2019re not great at it now.",

If you want to go that path, I recommend reading through the book rather than just googling to find solutions. GeeksforGeeks also has great articles I used alongside it.",

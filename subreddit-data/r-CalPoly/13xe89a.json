    "postText": "I am an OCOB student with an accounting concentrating but am struggling with registering with classes currently. After talking with a CP advisor I was informed that my department has stopped teaching BUS 323 Intermediate Accounting 3 and is only teaching one accounting elective per quarter. I have 5 courses left at CP and two of those classes must be accounting electives to meet graduation requirements. Foothill College is teaching Intermediate Accounting 3, Accounting Ethics, and a few other accounting courses that meet the CP requirements to graduate. Since I cannot register for the classes I need to graduate, am I able to take them at Foothill and have them transfer? Has anyone in OCOB taken concentration courses at Foothill College? If so, how long does it take to have them transfer to your Poly Portal? \n\nSHORT: Has anyone in OCOB taken concentration courses at Foothill College? Is this allowed??",

    "postText": "Reminder for incoming freshmen &amp; transfers. CalPoly is one of a few universities in California that require Meningococcal B vaccine. It is different than the MengACWY vaccine. Most incoming students would probably need to get it. It takes 2-3 shots to complete the series so plan accordingly.\n\nhttps://chw.calpoly.edu/health/immunizations",

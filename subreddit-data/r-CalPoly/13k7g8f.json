    "postText": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI am currently a CM minor looking to plan out my graduation and completing my minor. I have not done any of the CM minor tech electives but notice that a lot of them are 2 units which means I need many classes to graduate. Does anyone know the difficulty of CM 310 and / or have any advice. As well as does anyone have any recommendations for CM 334 Construction Law. \n\nOverall, do any Construction Management majors have advice on any easy CM tech electives to take. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

You\u2019ll have plenty of time to figure it out and they are super helpful with helping CM minors get off of waitlist for classes. Also I took 4 of the 2 unit CM classes at once along with 2 arch classes and wasn\u2019t overwhelmed. You\u2019ll be just fine.",

Living on campus is totally a great way to get to know the area and make friends but the rooms are a little small and rent is not cheap. I have preferred living on campus a lot more and you can always look on the Cal Poly Facebook Roommate page and people are always looking for roommates. The only thing I would say about living off campus is that you need to invest in transportation or have a car since unfortunately living off campus can sometimes be quite far.",

I\u2019m also an incoming transfer, but when I filled out the application it didn\u2019t really ask any questions other than what RLC I want. I\u2019m curious how they put like-minded people together without knowing anything about them?",

Perhaps they don\u2019t do that anymore? If you don\u2019t put that you have roommates to choose I believe they will automatically assign randoms!",

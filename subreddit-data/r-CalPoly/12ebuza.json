I am quite curious regarding what the student body is like (just like in general &amp; just business as well) For example, UC Berkeley is known for their competitive/ruthless environment, but also pushes you to your fullest potential. What would the equivalent phrase be for cal poly?",

There is no in between.\n\n^^(hopefully) ^^obvious ^^/s",

Most business people I meet have outstanding involvement in clubs, professional frats, work, research, etc and they know how to balance it with their social life. \n\nThe college of business has a lot of resources to support your professional and academic journey, but nowhere near pushing you to your fullest potential like UCB. It's more how you decide to make of these resources and connections but there's no limit to where you can go. The students that come are already self motivated which I think already sets people up for success post grad.",

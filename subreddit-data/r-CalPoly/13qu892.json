This has started to lead me to maybe going for the embedded route more. \n\nI\u2019m really stuck on what to do, am I going to lose out on a lot if I take 315? \n\nIf I take 333, am I not going to learn a lot about the software side of things?\n\nAny advice is appreciated.",

            "comment": "The other three comments are pretty spot on. Both are great classes. If you have no interest in hardware/computer design at all, then take 315 as it is a bit less work. You don't need to feel pressure now to decide the rest of your future, whatever you decide will almost certainly not be what comes to pass anyway.\n\nAll that said, there will be things you learn in 333 about the way processors, and hardware more generally, are implemented that you will not learn in 315. That stuff will be relatively difficult to pick up on your own. There are some things covered in some version of 315 that you won't get much of in 333, namely a bit more focus on how to take architectural features (like cache layout, mutlicore, etc) into account to optimize your programs. This stuff is great, but relatively less difficult to pick up on your own. \n\nYou can think of both classes as structured around the ISA, with 333 being focused on how to implement hardware to support that ISA and 315 being focused on how to utilize the abstraction of the ISA.",

            "comment": "You seem uncertain about your career choices which is starting to affect how much you can get out of your education during your time here at Cal Poly. I recommend that you start doing research about the different fields of SWE so that you can make an informed decision about what career you want to pursue. You still have time to get on the right path if you start your research now. In my opinion, it'll be too late if you decide what field you want to pursue fall quarter because that's when internship season starts and you won't have anything on your resume to be competitive for them. Asking for advice from the CPE director or using Google is a good place to start.",

For me, the transition was almost effortless but I had a very high GPA coming out of my first two quarters freshman year. \n\nAfter having some conversations with faculty and now having a couple years of exposure to the major (I\u2019m a third year), it sounds like it may still be difficult to get into predominantly because the major is so small and underfunded in comparison to the rest of OCOB. A common track for high achieving ECON majors is typically a quantitative analysis concentration paired with a STAT/CS minor. I\u2019ve enjoyed my studies thoroughly so far and I encourage to to switch into ECON if you\u2019re interested. Just be aware that it is probably one of the more difficult majors to get into in OCOB.",

I will say that they told me they looked at my application from high school and that I had no trouble because I would\u2019ve gotten into Econ if I had applied as a high schooler, so keep that in mind. I think that there is definitely room for growth within the CP Econ department and we\u2019ve lost key professors over the last few years, but still I was certainly challenged at times and it was extremely rewarding. \n\nEconomics, and Cal Poly in general, is all about what you put into it: if you\u2019re going to make the effort to transfer skills from one class to another, especially from Econ 311, you will be rewarded and be successful.",

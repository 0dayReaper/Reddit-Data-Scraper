Bring your own trash bags for your dorm room trash can, just cause the public one is likely going to be full all the time, some way to store open dry foods, like ziplock bags or plastic containers. Try to avoid wet or cold foods, the fridges are tiny and the public fridge/freezer are not guaranteed for your stuff not to be used.",

A kick ass first aid kit, because you're public health and it'll be good practice. Look up Youtube dorm tours for Yak and then just expect it to be more crowded than shown!",

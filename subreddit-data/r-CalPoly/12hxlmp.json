This would start August 1st and is a 12month lease. Looking for someone who can either afford 1350 for their half or 2 people can split the room at 725 per person. If this sounds like a deal for you please inbox me. I don\u2019t have a whole lot of time to get this nailed down\u2026The apartment (Cedar Creek) is walking distance to campus.",

    "postText": "Hello!! I am thinking about applying to this school because there\u2019s a good chance i\u2019ll be living in SLO by next year (so no on campus living). I have no clue about the application process for these schools because I went to a community college. So im considering transferring but I have a couple questions. \n\nIm going in as a Spanish major but I also am taking classes in computer science and data analysis. would I still be able to continue CS or is everything really competitive. \n\nWhen does the application for fall 2024 open? (yes I know it\u2019s far but general ball park or any prediction based on 2023) \n\nwhat are some tips or advice you\u2019d give to a person trying to get in? \n\nAre there any other universities besides this one that I could go to in the SLO area?",

If you haven\u2019t decided on a major you are already behind, especially for competitive major like CS, or any in general.\n\nYes there is another university in San Luis. Columbia College offers classes at Cuesta college. It\u2019s a private university.",

This way, you'll be able to attend SOME classes while you're waitlisted.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, the CS and SE majors are impacted across the entire CSU system so regardless of where you go it'll be heavily impacted.\n\nOutside of SLO, the closest university is probably UCSB, but that's not within the local area (2 hour drive to Goleta). \n\nIf you're still taking community college classes, I recommend you take stuff at Cuesta College next year so it'll be easier for you to transfer into SLO.",

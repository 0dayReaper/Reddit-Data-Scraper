The roommate I am going to add is in a different college than me (I am in CAFES and she's in OCOB). If I pick the college-based communities, will we not be able to room together because we are in two different colleges? Does that mean I should pick a different RLC? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[http://www.housing.calpoly.edu/content/res\\_life/living\\_learning](http://www.housing.calpoly.edu/content/res_life/living_learning)",

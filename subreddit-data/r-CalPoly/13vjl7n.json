It makes you stand out in materials engineering jobs, bc most materials engineers are just mech engineers who just ended up being interested in materials engineering. However it makes it harder to get regular general or mechanical engineering jobs because you kind of have to vouch for your degree and your skills.\n\nIndustrial engineering is like the opposite side of the spectrum in that it\u2019s probably the least specialized engineering degree you can get (aside from maybe general engineering). IE is great tho if you\u2019re into engineering and are able to do the math, but are more interested in managerial/team leader positions, business entrepreneurship, and application engineering (working directly with a customer to satisfy their design needs).\n\nI was materials eng for 2 quarters and I just wasn\u2019t into it, you have to be really into material processing/properties, chemical compositions, micro structures etc. I ended up switching to BMED which is what I graduated in, the job search was a bit of a challenge, but worth it to study something I was interested in.\n\nI\u2019d focus less on what will get you a job, and more on what actually interest you. In my experience, pretty much the only degrees where getting a job is straight up easier is maybe electrical engineering, hvac concentration in mechanical engineering, and comp sci. anything else and you\u2019re gonna have to do the whole internships, networking, job fairs thing, so you might as well enjoy what you\u2019re studying!",

To really succeed as an IE, you have to have good fundamentals of electrical design. Most IEs are lost when we get to the kitty gritty of the issues seen by customers.",

In terms of jobs, it really depends on the industry since MATEs can work in basically anything (metals, corrosion, batteries, solar, aerospace, food etc). Personally, I\u2019ve found a serious need in corrosion. I walked away with 3 jobs offers by just introducing myself as a Cal Poly MATE with a little experience in corrosion.",

Got to work outside all day every day! Amazing experience. Then they gave me a promotion, which they claimed would be more than 50% in the field still, but I actually ended up spending 90% of my time staring at a computer.\n\nI lasted about two weeks, then quit the job altogether. Now I\u2019m moving to Montana to work in forestry.\n\n\u201cWe are society\u2019s middle children. Forced to work jobs we hate, to buy shit we don\u2019t need, to impress people we don\u2019t like.\u201d",

That doesn\u2019t happen very often in college. I feel like for people who are good at not procrastinating, it\u2019s realistic to say college as a whole isn\u2019t as much work as high school is.",

Hour for hour, high school definitely asks for more than college, it mostly just comes down to time management which isn\u2019t meant to belittle the point at all, time management is truly one of the most difficult skills to master IMO. That being said, totally possible OP is getting fucked and if that\u2019s the case hopefully I\u2019m providing a little perspective on the fact that at some point it will get less demanding of your time",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an English transfer student and I just got conditional admission to Cal Poly a few days ago. I accepted admission and sent my transcripts. I realized that I withdrew from a class this semester after the deadline to make changes to my application had passed. That class might not appear on my transcript at all, or if it does, it will show that I withdrew from the course. This class has nothing to do with my graduation status, degree, or anything of substance. I took it out of pure interest, but dropped it when I realized I didn\u2019t have the time for it. I\u2019m worried that it will negatively affect me, but it\u2019s a completely irrelevant class to me. Anyone know if I should be worried or what will happen next?",

They pretty much said to accept admission and send my transcripts, but didn\u2019t say much else. I\u2019m more so looking to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation. Thanks for responding though!",

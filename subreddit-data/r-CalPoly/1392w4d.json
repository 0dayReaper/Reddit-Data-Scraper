    "postText": "Hi,\nMy roommate is in COSAM and would like to live in that RLC, which I understand is in the Yak dorms. But we both greatly prefer to be in a double room, and I have heard that yak has very limited doubles, and is mostly triples. \nWhat are the chances we get a double in yak?\nAlso, If we put a secondary RLC in our housing application, will we be able to choose a double from that RLC if there are no doubles available in yak, or will we only be able to choose from triples in yak?\nAlso any other ideas or feedback is appreciated :)\nThank you !",

COSAM is in yak\u0294it\u02b8ut\u02b8u this year but I believe it was in the towers last year and no one knows yet where it will be next year so don\u2019t choose your RLC based on its current location, there\u2019s no guarantee it will be in the same place. Three, there are not a lot of double options anywhere in first-year housing. There are some, depending on where you live, but I would prepare yourself for having a third roommate.",

Don't buy from a dealership, bring someone with you who knows what to look for in used cars. dealers mark shit up way too high it's ridiculous.\n\nIdk your financial situation but I'd look for anything with &lt;80k miles and under 4-5k. Nothing with a salvage title. Years 95-09ish probably best bet bc there aren't many electrical systems that will break. Don't get anything German in this price range either if you want it to last.",

They tend to be on the cheaper side and run well till 150k + miles (my odyssey has 150k and runs very well). repairs on them are also relatively cheap. Also try too look for cars that have had 1-2 previous owners. a single or double owner car just means you know more about the history and is more likely to be in better condition",

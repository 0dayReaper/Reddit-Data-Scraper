Art, music and cultural options have grown a lot in the last couple years. Very tolerant, friendly area in general, and the campus seems to be similar, though I'm not there regularly so take that with a grain of salt. You can easily get around campus and town using transit or a bike, or even by walking if you're a regular walker. \n\nMultiple beaches, tons of parks and hiking, quite a few groups and organizations to get involved with. And if you run out of things to do in SLO County, Santa Barbara is an hour and a half south, Los Angeles is 3 hours south, the Bay Area is 4 hours north.  \n\nTo be fair though, you know what they say: \"There's no such thing as a boring place, only boring people.\"",

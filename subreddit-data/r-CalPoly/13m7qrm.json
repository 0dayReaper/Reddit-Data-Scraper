I was just wondering if you guys have like 2-3 day weekends of a good amount of free time often since I would like to drive down to LA or back to SF occasionally for other reasons.",

If u have some GEs mixed in and are a fast worker, then it\u2019s reasonable that you\u2019d be free 2 days a week though. There are just some courses that can be legit 30+ hours per week commitments like 357, 454, 464, PL. depends on the courses and depends on your abilities. I personally work ~60 hours a week, but I\u2019m taking 3 cs classes, a ge, and my senior project rn",

            "comment": "I was a transfer for unrelated major but commuted daily to campus. Daily because realistically it's where I could get studying done.\n\nAs a result, I was in the library 7 days a week.\n\nSaturdays, no one was in there. \n\nBut on Sundays, it would get packed! Sundays in the library is a thing. So based on this, I would say 1 or 1&amp;1/2 free days a week on average.\n\nI had so many classmates that would go live their best lives on the weekends and pull all-nighters on weeknights to catch up. I would get texts from teammates working on their portion of our group projects at 3 am lol.\n\nI had one professor openly admit that if it was between studying and going to Coachella (for example), she would choose Coachella and pay the consequences in class after lol.\n\nCongrats on getting to Cal Poly! Make sure to have fun, time goes by quick!!!!!!!!",

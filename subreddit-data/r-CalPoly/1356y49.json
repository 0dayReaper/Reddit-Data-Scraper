I know it sounds kind of dumb but I need to make sure (plus the student center is super ambiguous as to whether I accepted or declined the offer). All I remember is clicking the left button and that's about it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for wasting your time a bit.\n\n(side note: I'm still able to access all of my account stuff, and the student center page remains mostly unchanged)",

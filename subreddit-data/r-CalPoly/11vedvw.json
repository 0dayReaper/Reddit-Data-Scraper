In terms of finding jobs and salary, is it better to concentrate in finance or accounting (or something else)?\n2. What are the biggest companies that offer internships or full-time positions for finance?\n3. What are the biggest companies that offer internships or full-time positions for accounting?\n4. Are there any reasons why going to UW would be better than going to SLO?\n5. What is student life like? I heard that SLO is kind of \"boring\" because of its location. \n\nThank you so much to everyone that read or answered my questions!!",

            "comment": "Hi OP, congratulations on your acceptance. Cal Poly is a great school and OCOB has some great programs. I will advise you though that not all of the concentrations are all that great. Some are kind of lacking in resources, representation, as well as recruiting pipelines. Cal Poly is a great option within CA but if you get an acceptance from Cal or UCLA for business, definitely take that. \n\nAs for your questions:\n\n1) Accounting averages some of the highest salaries, and honestly carries the business college\u2019s starting salaries. Accounting is a lower barrier to entry role that offers great opportunities, but not \u201cfuck you\u201d levels of money unless you become a partner. \n\nThe finance program here at Cal Poly is not all that great. The recruiting pipeline is pretty weak, the finance club(s) are not as established as the accounting club, and there\u2019s just a much weaker alumni network I\u2019d say. There are a handful of people every year who get investment banking offers but I do really mean a handful. \n\nI would advise to go accounting, as it\u2019s much safer, it\u2019s what this school is really known for, and the recruiting pipelines are there.\n\n2) I don\u2019t really see finance majors getting particularly consistently strong placements at any firms. There\u2019s a ton of variability in where people land and that\u2019s pretty much for the reasons stated above. Overall, weaker placements than accounting.\n\n3) The big4 combined hire hundreds a year from Poly. Add in the other large PA firms and you\u2019ve got most of the accounting concentrations there, as well as a lot of the IS guys.\n\n4) UW Seattle is honestly a better school with better placements. I\u2019d argue that UW\u2019s business program has better ties to big tech thanks to MS and AMZN. Cal Poly ofc has the engineering ties but business doesn\u2019t send that many people to business roles for top tech. Their undergrad placements are generally stronger.\n\nAnother reason why is the MBA program of UW Foster, which is a T25 that has strong placements. Even as an undergrad, you\u2019d have access to another alumni network going off to great firms who can serve as a pivotal network. Foster does pretty well with your standard MBA recruiting in things like FDLPs and consulting, whereas the Cal Poly MBA program is honestly quite sad.\n\n5) Student life is fine. SLO is a bit further out there so if you enjoy the vibe of city colleges like UCLA and Cal, you may not enjoy it at first, but there are positives. Being in a college town means everywhere you go, you will run into other students. Makes it easy to be social and make friends when everyone shares a common base. Lots of nice hiking spots around if you\u2019re into that.",

There\u2019s just not a recruiting presence for it and marketing is already an extremely oversaturated and low-paid industry as it is. Do not pursue it. IS is a great concentration.",

            "comment": "Accounting is definitely the best major if you just want a job. The college often boasts about its 100% job placement rate. However, I chose Finance and I still think it\u2019s a good option. There\u2019s more variability in the types of jobs you get, but most of the jobs are more interesting and pay more. The biggest companies that offer Finance positions are mostly large Bay Area based companies. Cal poly has a strong pipeline to Apples finance program and places like Amazon, Qualcomm, Chevron, Cisco, and Applied Materials normally take a few cal poly kids each year. For accounting the big 4 and other public accounting firms take the majority of kids. If there\u2019s anything specific you want to know about the Finance program, let me know and hopefully I can answer it.",

            "comment": "Accounting concentration leads to easier job placement with relatively good salaries \n\nFinance concentration leads to riskier job placement with a large range in salaries both well above and well below the accounting concentration salary range\n\nIt really comes down to how well you build connections, how well you do academically, and how well you apply yourself outside of classes.\n\nfor finance concentration roles Cal Poly doesn't get big names on campus, so you need to build connections on your own. We aren't ranked highly enough to be a target school for investment banks for example. Accounting firms always offering intern positions though. \n\nUW might be better based on weather, relative cost (idk if you're in-state or not), and between the two I honestly don't think it matters too much. Completely up to you. \n\nSLO's location does kind of suck if you don't enjoy nature (beach, hiking, surfing, etc). Also, the beach and hiking are not very convenient when you don't have a car so first year is very limited. Food-wise, campus food sucks, and the options in town are also quite limited (good food but not very diverse).",

            "comment": "Dr. Shlaer is personally one of my highly-rated professors. Had him for PHYS 141 and currently for PHYS 405 (Quantum Mechanics I). In my experience, he is rather flexible a lot of times and is very willing to help you succeed if you reach out. \n\nAs for ASTR 101, you'll mainly be tested on concepts of astronomy and not very much the calculations, but I took ASTR 301 rather than ASTR 101 so perhaps there is something I'm missing about the course. One thing I will say is that many students underestimate the material and this is reflected in the grade distribution of the first midterm. I would suggest that you study the questions Dr. Shlaer asks during the lecture as well as the tutorial book that you work on in class since those are great practices for you to apply the concepts you learn in class, and those questions match the level of difficulty the exams will have.\n\nI am actually one of the LA's for the course right now coincidentally, so if you ever feel stuck just call over the guy with the long hair and red sweater.",

No homework, just a couple of projects that maybe took me an hour to complete (one of which you are required to go to the observatory which is cool). Pretty sure he curved our final a little so I wouldn\u2019t worry. He\u2019s super chill and helpful with concepts too- this is coming from a non stem major lol.",

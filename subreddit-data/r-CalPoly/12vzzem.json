Earliest you can change majors is after first quarter (ends in December) but to actually change that soon you should start talking with your college as soon as you can to figure out what classes you need to take 1st quarter. You probably won't want all the ones they're blocking you into automatically and some major changes involve credit requirements in certain catalogs.\n\nAlso huge Skill Issue how do you choose a major in November/December and decide it's bad 5 months later. Also don't call majors bad that's so disrespectful they just might not be a good fit for you. If you want to trash talk a major best course of action is to wait a quarter until you know people in that major so you can roast specific aspects of the major accurately",

Granted, GE and support courses may have helped, but not the major courses.\n\nAlthough I\u2019d agree that no major is, inherently, \u201cbad\u201d, and that it\u2019s definitely the one to choose if you want to go on to be a history professor or maybe politics, the history majors I\u2019ve talked to all reported choosing it because the other majors seemed too mathematical, analytical, or rigorous. It\u2019s as though they were majoring in \u201cnone of the others\u201d just to satisfy a perceived expectation that they hold _some_ kind of university degree.\n\nThis becomes problematic if a person is taking out loans to get their education. Many times, the strongest argument for getting a four-year is the ROI. Even though someone needs to go into debt to _get_ a degree, the higher income from _having_ that degree pays for itself and is a net gain, after some time. But that ROI differs wildly across majors, and that partner is _still_ paying down that loan for her history degree, 16 years later.\n\nSo, majors like History and English might not be inherently bad, but I think you could still argue that it\u2019s unwise to take out a loan to pursue those majors (unless, of course, the goal is to become a professor of it).",

            "comment": "You have to be at cal poly at least one quarter before you can try to switch majors and it\u2019s a process that can take 1-2 quarters. There\u2019s a very specific process you need to follow, which is set by your future department. Typically it involves the future department looking at your current gpa and also whether you would have been accepted to that major if it was on your original application. If you\u2019re ok with that part, they\u2019ll give you a mini contract called an ICMA specifying a couple of classes you have to take in the new major over the next two quarters and get good grades. If you meet whatever grades they\u2019re requiring, you\u2019ll be allowed to switch majors.  For now, talk to the Mustang success center first year advising office when you get your fall schedule in august to ask them to help you tweak your schedule if needed so you have classes that will count for both your current and future majors. To see the specific requirements and change process for your target major, Google \u201ccal poly change of major [future major]\u201d. As far as the ease of making changes, it\u2019s easier to change majors within your college than across colleges, but both are possible.",

I kind of just go to class and go home. \n\nI\u2019ve coasted through high school and college not making meaningful relationships. Going into a job next year is kind of giving me a quarter life crisis lmao. It feels like once I get a job that all the interesting shit I was supposed to do is done.\n\nI\u2019ve been to a couple parties and have just been awkward as fuck so I just never tried after that. I\u2019m in a couple of clubs but they\u2019re not really fulfilling. I have like no friends but a good amount of acquaintances. I want to do tinder also but I feel like I\u2019m too soft and would just get my feelings hurt \ud83d\ude22 \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is how it is for a good amount of people but it\u2019s been my experience.",

You'll have more opportunities to meet, befriend, and do fun stuff with people in the coming years and, the bonus is that you'll actually have money to take fun trips.  No more slumming it on a college budget all the time!\n\nAll that's required is having an open mind and a willingness to say yes to things that interest you.\n\n&gt; It feels like once I get a job that all the interesting shit I was supposed to do is done.\n\nBy the way, anyone that says that kind of shit probably peaked in high school / college so it's mostly a flawed take.",

Probably had some impact on socializing.\n\nBest thing to do now is start now. Seems like you already know what\u2019s wrong and what you don\u2019t like. Let\u2019s start with you just going to class and going home. Is that something you WANT to do? If it is, then no issue. If not, what\u2019s stopping you from putting something inbetween? If it\u2019s because you have too much work, try getting some of that work done between classes. If it\u2019s because you don\u2019t know what to do, try hanging out with some of those acquaintances. Relationships are a two way street so you have to put in some effort to get to know people better and have closer friends. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work and again, it\u2019s because relationships are a two way street and the other person may not be interested.\n\nYou also mention being in clubs that aren\u2019t fulfilling. Again, what\u2019s stopping you from quitting and joining another club? It\u2019s totally okay to drop it and join another one. I and many others have bounced around clubs for over three years. If you\u2019re worried about the experience getting cut short, don\u2019t worry about it. The club experience doesn\u2019t have to end when you graduate, you could always revisit or stay in touch with the people you\u2019ve met.\n\nYou\u2019re an engineer right? Don\u2019t you find problems and fix them? Seems like you\u2019ve already found the problems in your life so get fixing.\n\nOh and never download Tinder.",

IMO. \n\nWhen you get a job, even if you are just entry level, build relationships with the elders. When I was first starting out Directors, VPs, and CEO's really intimidated me... But they are amazing role models (most of the time) and they know how to help you grow in your career. Don't avoid them. Get them to know you and be honest with them about what you're interests are.

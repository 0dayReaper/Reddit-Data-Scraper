    "postText": "My Fellow Mustangs,\u00a0\n\nI am Charlie Elizarraraz, a first-year Architectural Engineering student. Since beginning my first quarter here at Cal Poly Slo, I realized I am not getting work done at the rate I want to and have trouble focusing when doing assignments. From what I can tell, the majority of this problem was due to being addicted to my phone.\u00a0\n\nDid you know that over 75% of college students have reported being addicted to their phones? From that 75%, each hour of sleep the college students lost from their recommended 9 hours of sleep equals an average loss of .007 in their end-term GPA. That means most of you, cal poly students, are also struggling with this problem.\u00a0\n\nI researched many ways to stop myself and of course, the obvious answer is to simply turn off your phone. But having the discipline to do so is difficult so other options are to set a time limit on your device therefore if you try to access any distracting applications, it forces you out. Another option is to participate in recreational sports or clubs around campus limiting the amount of time you are able to access your phone. Lastly, if you can study with friends and do assignments with peers from your class, you don\u2019t feel the need to pull your phone out and scroll through tik tok in the middle of your assignment.\n\nI hope some of these suggestions help you, my fellow mustangs, reduce your screen time and improve your quality of life!",

Best advice I can give is deleting the app entirely. TikToks algorithm is too good and can pull anybody in for hours. Just get rid of it",

That seems rather extreme as a student could easily skip out on 100 hours of sleep over a year but not see their GPA drop by 0.7. \n\nAlso, if any other engineering students are getting 9 hours of sleep a night, please share where you got your time-stopping watch lol",

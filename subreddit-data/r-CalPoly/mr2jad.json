The Design Village competition has a long history and has become one of the most anticipated events of the year for the College of Architecture &amp; Environmental Design (CAED). True to our \"learn-by-doing\" experience, competitors design and build \"shelters\" in which said competitors inhabit their respective structures throughout the entirety of the weekend.",

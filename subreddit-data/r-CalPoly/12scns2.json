    "postText": "I'm in my third year studying wine business at Cal Poly SLO. Though I've learned a lot about the wine business and have taken a harvest internship, I still feel like something in my education is missing. Flash forward --&gt; I've signed up to take Chemistry classes at Cuesta in the Fall of my last year at Cal Poly. I'm pretty sure it'll take two years for the associate's, even though I got a 4 on my AP Chem exam.\n\nI'm very motivated, especially through academic challenge. My end goal is a getting into a master's program with my Chem credits in a couple years when the associate's is done. Is it possible? Even with Cal Poly's masters program?",

I think it's pretty easy to get into most cal poly masters programs if you have 3.0+ but it'll be a waste of time/money to get an associates. I was considering going into the cal poly masters from the environmental management BS -&gt; environmental engineering, and learned that it was a lot easier to do my masters at a UC school.",

There is only the polymer and coatings MS for chemistry here. \n\nPersonally since I just applied for chemistry graduate programs I can vouch that it is hard enough even to get in most places even if you have research and a decent GPA. If you had research in a chemistry lab then I would say its very possible, but without it its not a strong case.",

Dr. Egon is also great and is familiar with making career switches.\n\nTake chemistry at cal poly, if at all possible. Ask chem professors to do research with them even if it is only for a quarter.\n\nIf you have/get a bachelors, don't say that you have an associate's in chemistry- it makes you seem less qualified. Talk about wine and vit bachelors then explain how you focused on chemistry.",

            "comment": "To get accepted into any MS program one *must* have a BS degree or equivalent (\"equivalent\" usually applies to some overseas applicants).  \n\nYour post can be interpreted in two different ways.\n\nInterpretation 1: You intend to drop your current major at Cal Poly, get an Associate's degree in Chemistry and apply to an MS program. This will be hard because - see above - most of the time a BS degree is a requirement.\n\nInterpretation 2: You intend to receive your BS in (Wine and Viticulture?, Agribusiness?) *and* you intend to obtain an Associate's degree in Chemistry. With these credentials, you are actually a meaningful applicant to an MS in Chemistry program - esp. those MS in Chem programs that don't mind some retraining (i.e., admit students with BS degrees outside of Chemistry).",

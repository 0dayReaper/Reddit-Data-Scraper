But now I do and it sucks. I have a 4.4 GPA and I have my heart at CalPoly. What can I do at CC to give me the best chance of getting transferred? \n\nI am starting CC in July to get an early start. \n\nAlso, what is the earliest I can apply to transfer? Do I have to do a full 2 years at CC or 60 units or can I apply before that just because?\n\nI wish I knew what I wanted sooner but now I'm just beating myself over this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice would mean the world to me, I'm local to California and I want to major in Business. Thanks!!!",

            "comment": "So I\u2019m not an expert but I\u2019m also planning on transferring in Fall 2025. CalPoly doesn\u2019t accept lower division transfers, meaning you have to have completed two years equivalent of CC, which means 60 semester credits or 90 quarter credits depending on your college. That would be extremely hard to do in one year imo unless you\u2019re able not to work and have someone else supporting you, but it\u2019s not impossible depending on class rigor.\n\nI did a year of college during HS and I applied as a freshman and got accepted. \n\nI\u2019m taking a year off because of the cost and bc i\u2019m out of state but if that\u2019s not something that matters to you as much you could always use this time to get work experience in the field (they specifically ask you if it\u2019s major related) and knock out some of your future GEs and pre-reqs (you can find the flowchart for your major online).\n\noh and last, you can apply before you finished all of your units as long as you have them done by the spring before the fall you choose to attend. also feel free to call cp admissions office they actually pick up and help. hope this helps and you can view this as a positive bc a year off can be fun. you got this:))",

I transfered with a 3.8 GPA I believe and made it into Business Admin as a transfer. Get your GE classes done at a JC, get as many credits as you can, get good grades, and it shouldn't be to hard to get in. Also getting in some work experience in while in JC is a good jump start into getting your resume filled.",

You also have plenty of time to potentially change majors if desired. The hardest thing you might hit getting into CP is the quarter system if you make it in before semester system kicks in. That was the toughest transition after getting in for me",

Use Rate my Professor a lot to find teachers that will suit your needs the most. Talk to your counselors and never be afraid to ask questions or go to office hours. Most people in cc are there to help you and will be valuable resources as you navigate through the next 2 years. Also, as a safety precaution I would look into the UC TAG program, find a UC that has similar requirements to Cal Poly that way you have a good safety to fall back on (assuming you complete the requirements). Feel free to ask if you have further questions too.",

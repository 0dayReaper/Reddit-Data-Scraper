Bittorrent alone will show your IP address to other peers so that they can re-download the pieces of your Rick and Morty episode that you downloaded from other peers. This makes you legally complicit in the sharing of the copyrighted material.\n\nA VPN would change that IP address to something that doesn't exist in the universities IP block which means Cartoon Network corporate can send a letter to Lithuania asking them to pretty please stop sharing copyrighted content instead of the admin who has access to your internet usage.\n\nKill Switch is just in case the VPN disconnects, i.e. Stop torrenting if your mask slips off.",

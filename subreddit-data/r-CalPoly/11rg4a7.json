I worked on campus and eventually at some local places to pay it down, and was lucky enough to get 3 engineering internships as well. When I graduated in 2020, I owed about $60,000 total still. \n\nRight now, my non-CS engineering degree from cal poly is getting me over 6 figures. All my debt was paid off within 2 years.\n\nIf you got into Cal Poly for CS and you\u2019re worried about pay, as long as you can make it through to the end to get your degree, you should be fine.

With that and a bit of luck, you should be able to get a job and make north of 150k total compensation a year in many cities. Then you can pay off loans relatively easily. This has been my general experience and observations. \n\nIf there's any doubt about whether college is worth it, I'd say a computer science degree is the one degree that is absolutely worth it. It has some of the highest salaries out of any enginering, even starting salaries. \n\nI recommend looking at the website [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) to get an idea of what kind salaries you would be looking at when you graduate.",

Nearby there are a lot of good places for hiking, downtown is a bit distant but in 40 or so minutes on foot you can reach it (otherwise you can always use a car, Uber or a bus). \n\nOnly major thing you should know that may pose a challenge is the workload. \"Learn by doing\" is not there for show, you need constance and concentration to do well around here, because you'll have a lot to do, especially if you take four 4-unit classes each quarter. Good news is that there are services and places where you can go to get help, and there are a lot of places where to study mostly or completely undisturbed.\n\nThese are some of the things I can come up with right now, I'll add more if I can think of anything else, but I hope my comment may be helpful.",

I did history classes, and the main thing I can suggest you is to read all the required readings without missing or procrastinating too much on them. Also you will write a lot, but mostly short papers. \n\nFor your major it should also be required to take a class dedicated specifically to writing for which you'll have to make a 10 page long paper (not the Senior Project, that comes later), but do not be worried, the professor of that course will guide you for three months by making you divide the work (and she is a nice person too). If you do not procrastinate or do it all at the last minute (I did, don't follow my example if you can) you will do just fine.",

There aren't even many shopping stores for clothes so you're left with essentially nothing to do, no shopping, no good food.....beaches far from campus ect . Also people at cal poly love to advertise the \"learn by doing\" motto but unless you are in agriculture or engineering or architecture, there is no learn by doing",

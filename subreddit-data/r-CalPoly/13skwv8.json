Easily on of the best profs I\u2019ve ever had. In his 233 class which I took last quarter, during the lab section he would open up packs of pokemon cards and give extra credit based on how rare the card was. He\u2019s pretty lenient about getting stuff in, but he just wants you to learn your stuff, so as long as you go to lab and pay attention, it won\u2019t be that bad. He\u2019s super helpful if you get stuck as well. Hope this helps!",

    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI\u2019m applying to PhD programs this fall for Environmental Policy. I currently work for a non-profit, worked for the House of Reps, and I went to school for poli sci, so I\u2019ve got the grassroots sector/ policy making process covered. Based on what I want to research, though, I\u2019ll need a decent foundation in agribusiness. I don\u2019t know where to start and figured I\u2019d begin by reading through some textbooks on it.\n\nI know SLO has a great agricultural studies program! Do any of you have some favorite textbooks that you\u2019d recommend I purchase? Would any of you be up to chat about your thoughts on agribusiness + sustainability? Thanks in advance :)",

    "postText": "Every spring quarter, I seem to fall into a depression. I have friends but I don\u2019t have much waiting for me back at home. I\u2019m very fortunate to have found a job in my industry but I don\u2019t even feel proud of myself. Most of my family lives in my home country so it\u2019s only me and my dad. \nTo make matters worse, I have to move up to the bay right after graduation and my dad can\u2019t help me because he leaves for a trip 2 days after graduation. \nIt\u2019s been this way my entire life, I am forced to show up for myself because if I don\u2019t, no one else will. \nI\u2019m just so tired and for once, I\u2019d love to know how it feels to have family come down and help pack up my space, help me move in, help me with assignments\u2026etc.",

I came to the US alone, I survived college alone, and after graduation my work is in Texas. I am going to drive there by myself and rent an apartment alone. And no friends and family members to attend my graduation.",

    "postText": "I'm about to graduate with my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from UC Davis in the fall. While I was anticipating burnout, I'm not ready to be done with school, and I am up to the challenge. I'm very interested in VLSI, digital design and electronics. Cal Poly SLO was my number one for undergrad, and I was hoping someone from the program could provide some insight and experiences. Ty!!",

Lower divisions were tough for me because of virtual, and to be fair, there are some research focused professors who don't know how to teach. But I learned a lot about myself and how I learn, and I was able to get back to where I should be my junior year. I've found about 90% of my upper division classes to be extremely interesting and just the right amount of challenging. There are several professors who have changed my life, I actually tear up when I think about wonderful they are as teachers and people. UC Davis's lower divisions are rather hit or miss, but I've never felt alone in any of them. Almost all of the upper divisions are intellectually rewarding and invigorating. I never once doubted my choice in major.",

            "comment": "Cal Poly\u2019s undergrad engineering degrees are more respected than their masters engineering degrees imo. I did undergrad in EE and from my experience, the people who stayed to do the 4+1 (earn a masters in 1 year) didn\u2019t really gain any advantage in their careers. That being said, the whole learn by doing thing is awesome so the education you would get doing your masters at cal poly would be great. I\u2019d say if you just want to learn more about EE / keep taking classes and like practical hands on education more than research based education, it\u2019s probably worth it. One thing you will want to look into before making a decision though is the department drama that went on with EE recently. A lot of good professors left.",

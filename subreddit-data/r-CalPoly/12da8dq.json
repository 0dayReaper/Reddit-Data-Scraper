            "comment": "so on the housing application you pick a RLC (resident learning community).These RLCs are either based off your college or are another group (like Pride, substance free, Honors). They are assigned to a dorm after housing is due, so nobody knows which group is going to be in what dorm. \n\nIn short, no, there is no advantage to signing up earlier. I believe the way groups work is that groups of three choose first, then two, then singles. (at least I heard that somewhere). I went in as a single and got my first RLC choice despite a later date.",

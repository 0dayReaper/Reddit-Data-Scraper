However people say that This school is going to open great opportunities for internships and jobs. Should I go here for the opportunities although I would miss my home alot? I'm very conflicted.",

I was worried I would feel homesick but I also have an introverted roommate that I can relate to and get along with. And a lot of people here are nice and friendly and open to chat since it's a college town, so I was able to make some friends. I video call my parents almost daily but being busy can distract me from being able to call them. I actually forget that I'm away from home most of the time. What really helps is having a car so that you can explore and get more familiar and comfortable with the city. If possible, eventually living off-campus can really help you make your own space you can call home. The CS classes here are great and they can be difficult so they will keep you busy and engaged. Overall I don't regret coming here.",

            "comment": "Freshman year can be the best or worst year of your life. My advice for making it the best is to push yourself to be social. Leave your door open when you\u2019re in your dorm, knock on your neighbors\u2019 door to ask them to go get food or go to the farmer\u2019s market. Hang out with people in your classes to study and become friends with them, especially if some of them are older because they might have a car and you can go on day trips. Download zip car to be able to take said trips if you don\u2019t have access to a vehicle and invite potential friends to go with you. Participate in your WOW group and stay in touch, it\u2019s designed to give you a baseline for friends even if you don\u2019t stay that way. Worst case scenario you can make connections with reliable acquaintances in times of need. You don\u2019t need to be everyone\u2019s friend, just be friendly to everyone. Lots of little things add up. I was super awkward freshman year and socially anxious, but taking a breath and reminding myself that everyone else is trying to make friends too and everyone else around me is new to college life helped. It\u2019s not abnormal to go out of your way to be friendly. Try new things, go to parties even if you don\u2019t drink, join clubs, go on hikes even if it\u2019s on your own! Don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re stranded and alone because you aren\u2019t, you just make yourself that way. The discomfort and awkwardness of trying to build connections (and sometimes falling on your face which is totally okay too) is far outweighed by any regrets you may have about \u201cwoulda shoulda coulda\u201d when you\u2019re feeling alone later in college or even life and looking back at the opportunities you had that you didn\u2019t take. As long as you try and put effort into everything you do, you\u2019ll at least improve yourself even if you fail.",

However, at some point in your life, you will have to leave and set off on your own, you cant stay with your parents forever. It\u2019s better to do it during college since there\u2019s a lot of like minded people and resources that will allow you to cope and handle it well. If you leave your parents for the first time after college, you are going to have to manage that anxiety and loneliness a lot more independently which is going to be harder for you especially if you aren\u2019t comfortable being away. You are going to need to leave at some point so at least do it when everyone around you is in the same boat! Just be proactive in clubs or sports, whatever you like. I\u2019m an incoming transfer student for cs in the fall and although I\u2019m also slightly nervous, I know this is the best decision for my future and I\u2019m going to try and make the most of it! If you are genuinely super against leaving and know you won\u2019t be able to succeed, that\u2019s totally fine, you can spend two years at community and see if time changes your perspective on leaving. but keep in mind there is no guarantee that you will get in again.",

You miss making some early connections with dorm mates if you move in later. You\u2019ll definitely make friends with dorm mates anyways. Bring a door stopper from the $ store to hold ur door open for moving &amp; to meet people. And go to all the WOW week stuff, you\u2019ll meet so many people. WOW week can be like school but other parts are fun. Its an all day thing for multiple days. It\u2019s not a family thing it\u2019s a student thing. So if your parents help you unpack send them home or to a hotel. You might need them on standby at the hotel if they\u2019re willing to do that. Parents can go to pismo beach while your busy. I planned to stay at a hotel until Sunday when my son moved in but I left early bc it wasn\u2019t necessary. Cal poly is very friendly, especially in the beginning of the year because everyone in your dorm is new. Since you\u2019re cs student I hope you are a scholar &amp; get into the nice yakitutu (yack-it-you-too I think) dorms. The yakitutu dorms have co-ed bathrooms but it\u2019s not weird. Every stall has no cracks to see thru. &amp; bring a combo lock for your bathroom locker. Command hooks too. Only 2 or 3 towels. Laundry is free, provide ur own soap. Don\u2019t get the largest food program it u need to u can always upgrade but u can\u2019t downgrade. The local bus system for SLO is called RTA I think &amp; its easy to grocery shop or go to store when friends with cars go. Cal poly has its own bus/tram to get u from one end to the other end of campus. My son just walked to class until he got an e-scooter. My son will be 2nd year CS student so I could always connect you two. Not sure if ur female or male but he\u2019s friendly &amp; could tell u some stuff. Good luck. \n\nPs \nDepending on how far u r from home u could always visit home. There\u2019s Amtrak &amp; Zip cars u can rent by the hour really cheap, really good for younger students who can\u2019t rent a car. Zip car has rentals on campus. \n\nTLDR: Cal Poly is awesome &amp; friendly",

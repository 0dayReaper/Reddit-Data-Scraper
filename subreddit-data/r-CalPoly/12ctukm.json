Have there been other negative changes recently?",

In all honesty, it sounds rough. A large number of the faculty is resisting the change and the ones who aren\u2019t seem to really want to shift the curriculum to focus more on their topics of interest. While I think that professors should absolutely teach what interests them, some of the things they want to trade out are highly valued in industry. I honestly anticipate that it will be a mess for the first year, with professors resisting the change and being unprepared by the time it comes. \n\nCal poly has seen smaller changes than this that professors have reacted very poorly to. Such as the switch from polylearn to canvas. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t go to cal poly if I knew I was going to be there during this switch.",

In all honesty, it sounds rough.\n\nWhat? To my knowledge, as the CENG Curriculum Committee chair, there is no company helping CENG with the transition.\n\nThere are Q2S coordinators (faculty) across the departments within the college that have worked, with the other faculty in their departments, for more than a year now to develop the new curricula. The draft plans were submitted last quarter and are in generally great shape (I reviewed every single one).\n\nAre there faculty that don\u2019t want to switch? Of course. Were there challenging discussions given the complexity of such a switch? Of course. Will the transition be perfect? Probably not. \n\nWill CENG be prepared? Yes.\n\n&gt; with professors \u2026 being unprepared by the time it comes\n\nProfessors will be prepared.",

They\u2019re advising because they want CP to succeed and because they do have concerns. \n\nWhile Cal Poly may be confident in their transition, there are members of industry who are more skeptical and students and faculty should know and consider that.",

I already took 3 classes and somehow passed it but no matter how much I try to study and understand it, it\u2019s just so hard. Am I the only one who\u2019s having a hard time understanding Arce as an arch student? What was your experience? I also talked to alumnus and said not to stress about it too much because we won\u2019t even use it once we graduate since all we do is design. But still, I feel like these classes are just basic foundation to help us more but I just feel so bad for not understanding it.",

            "comment": "Architect here. Back when I was in school, these classes were called Structures, and I found them to be my hardest classes too. I remember many of my classmates struggling with them. They are required, so do your best and try to get to the other side.\n\nOnce you start practicing architecture, you almost always work with structural engineers who will do the beam sizing, etc for the project. It is important for you to have a fundamental understanding of how these pieces go together and support the building. It is also important to understand the space they take up and how that affects he aesthetics and functionality of the building. Even this knowledge will be developed over years in the field. \n\nHang in there. You\u2019re not the first one to feel this way.",

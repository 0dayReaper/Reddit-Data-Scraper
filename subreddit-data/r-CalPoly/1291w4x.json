            "comment": "No, no one has ever taken that class. You could be the first! Some things about this class are it's only for non-Aero students. Dr. Kolkailah is very nice and pretty old-school. Most of his classes are online only because he is rarely on campus (for health reasons). For spring quarter he is looking to change the class from the current state to be more of a seminar, meaning guest speakers who know about aerospace but aren't necessarily professors (grad students and the like) would present about a topic they know about instead of only him lecturing. A lot of the less technical Aero major courses are switching to/trying out/already using guest speakers to some extent and it's usually pretty memorable in a good way",

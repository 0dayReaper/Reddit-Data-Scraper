I'm planning on working over the summer and was hoping taking asynch classes would be a little easier than working while taking in-person classes at a community college.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm probably going to take :\n\nPHIL 230 with Sam Zahn\n\nPSY 252 with Jes\u00fas Serrano-Careaga\n\nSTAT 217 with Billie-Jo Grant\n\nWGQS 201 with Ednie Garrison\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso if anybody has taken any of these classes (in-person or not) and has any advice or has any advice about Cal Poly summer courses, it would be much appreciated !! :)",

    "postText": "We have a spinet piano we will give away for free if someone's willing to take it off our hands before this week ends. All the keys and pedals work, it's just a little out of tune (playable enough to where my roommates and I play it super often). You'd basically just need a dolly so you can roll it, and we're right by campus so if you're in SLO it shouldn't be too far of a walk to get it to where you live. Comment if interested!\n\nAlso, if you've got a truck or UHaul and are farther away that would ovbiously work.",

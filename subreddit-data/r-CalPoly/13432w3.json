    "postText": "Hello I am an incoming freshman for CS and was wondering if Quarter plus is worth the money or time. What I am understanding from the internet is that its just a communications class, that its a 4 week long program before fall classes start. I have a few questions on the following : \n\n1) would it be helpful towards my major?\n2) is it worth the money?\n3) what are the biggest cons/pros?\n\nI am reaching out for any input or insight on what the program is and what the experience would be like. Anything would be helpful! THANKS",

I had a friend do it with another prof and its the same setup; just 3 speeches (intro, argumentative, and informative if im not mistaken). I wouldve done 100x worse if it were in person but I would've done better if it was just asynchronous.",

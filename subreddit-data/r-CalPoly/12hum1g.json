    "postText": "I got into Cal Poly SLO as an environmental and soil science major, but am hoping to change to environmental engineering. I haven't accepted my admissions yet and was wondering how difficult it is to change majors, and if this one is impacted or not. Can I change before I accept admissions? Is it easier or more likely to change if I accept now? I've just been wondering because I really like the school, but I have more options where I would be able to take environmental engineering.",

However, I did notice a lot of environmental and soil science majors swap in to environmental engineering during my sophomore year, so I presume it's relatively easy? I would recommend you reach out to the Engineering Department. I think your best bet is to email the environmental engineering head, which is Dr. Rebekah Oulton, for advice. She's pretty nice.\n\nHere is the link to her contact info: [https://ceenve.calpoly.edu/faculty/roulton](https://ceenve.calpoly.edu/faculty/roulton)\n\nI would also advise reaching out to Cal Poly's academic advising center prior to emailing Dr. Oulton to get a clearer picture of the process. Good luck!\n\nIf you're going to be a first year, this link for academic advising would probably help you best: https://success.calpoly.edu/content/where-are-we",

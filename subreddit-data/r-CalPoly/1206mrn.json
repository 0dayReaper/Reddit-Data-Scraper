    "postText": "Hello all- my daughter was just accepted to the biomedical engineering program and is still considering a few other schools. I was just hoping to get some insight into that particular program and y\u2019alls experience there. \n\nAny labs/ professors to seek out, any to avoid?\n\nSeems like cal poly is really highly regarded for computer engineers. Does biomedical earn the same regard? How easy was it to find fulfilling employment after Poly (or transfer to fulfilling post grad more likely)?\n\nThanks I\u2019m advance!",

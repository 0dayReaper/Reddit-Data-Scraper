    "postText": "Howdy y\u2019all. I recently got accepted (holy shit) as my alternative major, Civil Engineering. My main major is Mechanical Engineering with an emphasis in sustainable energy and was wondering how difficult it would be to switch majors? I know how impacted both majors are, but I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s even possible to switch to ME. Has anybody done it and is it even possible?",

The specifics change every now and then, but if you\u2019re interested in engineering and cal poly, I wouldn\u2019t NOT accept the offer bc you were accepted into CivE, not MechE. \n\nAs an absolute back up, there\u2019s tons of ways to have a career in sustainability with a CivE background anyways. \n\nAccepted the offer, focus on good grades, and then assess your ability to transfer majors once you get a lil settled. \n\nGood luck and congratulations!",

It\u2019s all outlined in the link below, but all you should really need to do is complete your first quarter with a 2.75 GPA and then you can talk to an advisor in the winter and switch your major.  There\u2019s some majors where you\u2019ll need to complete an ICMA, which basically means you need to take certain classes and do well before your change of major is approved \u2014 but I don\u2019t think ME is one of them. \n\nhttps://eadvise.calpoly.edu/changing-majors/within-the-college-of-engineering",

It may delay your graduation slightly if you have trouble getting into these classes but the ME degree at cal poly is worth it tbh",

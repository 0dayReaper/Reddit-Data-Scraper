Double majoring at cal poly is really hard, but it does happen occasionally. It\u2019s a lot easier to add a minor than a second major. Here are the options. https://advising.calpoly.edu/minor-degree-advising.  Keep in mind that some classes are reserved first for majors during quarterly registration, so depending on the minor it can be a little hard to get into foundational classes until later in your second year when you start to have a little more registration priority.",

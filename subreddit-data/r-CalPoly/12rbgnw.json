    "postText": "Hi people,\n\nI'm a high school senior I've been admitted into SLO as a Philosophy major but was wondering about the process of getting onto the pre-med track, how easy it would be to get pre-med classes as a Philosophy major, and what minor openings are there as well? Is there a pre med advisor and are they helpful? How difficult is it to get to get a strong GPA? Is there a pre med community? \n\nAny advice is helpful, thanks!",

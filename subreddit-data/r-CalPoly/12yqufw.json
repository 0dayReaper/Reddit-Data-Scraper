    "postText": "Im a senior right now and im deciding between UC Davis and Cal Poly SLO. I\u2019m also considering community college but it\u2019s nothing to do with the financial part, it\u2019s more to do with I\u2019d be more comfortable doing a CC. The biggest factors I\u2019m considering are the chances I\u2019d have at finding a job after college. I want to be something combining business and math (operations research, financial, wtv). If you guys have any input regarding this please tell me because I want to make a decision before may first.\n\nOther factors:\nWill need loans for cal poly, not UC Davis\nUC Davis 3.5 hrs from home, Cal Poly 2.5 hrs\nLive in a Latino community\nDon\u2019t have a car\nIm ok living in communities where there\u2019s not much to do \nWant to do lots of internships\nNeed a job right after college (I need to support my mom, she\u2019s a single mother)",

Also you and your mother may need to have a tough conversation about finances if she needs additional support from your financially. It may be worth having her contact 211 and social services in her area to see if she can get any benefits to help out too",

            "comment": "I am close to people at both institutions.  Cal Poly has a more southern California culture, while Davis is more northern Cal while both have a strong agricultural influence.   Both are solid places to go and you literally can't make a wrong choice here.  Both SLO and Davis have a high cost of living.  Cal Poly is known for it's motto learn through doing which isn't just a slogan but an actual theme running through the school.  It's more vocational that way, for example finance majors can assist in running the school endowment for their senior project.  Not sure if you're interested in accounting, but a B average in the business school w/ an account emphasis will guarantee you a job with the big 4 firms.  Davis on the other hand will have more opportunities to take part in research as it's a full UoC with a vibrant post baccalaureate program.",

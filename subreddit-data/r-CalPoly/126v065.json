I\u2019m a 30\u2019year old dude whose a former police officer turned wildland firefighter. \n\nMy wife is a therapist and we live in slo. I checked out cal poly\u2019s Reddit feed just to see if I could find info about the school and the area since I\u2019m not from SLO.\n\nAnyway since then Reddit stuff concerning cal poly  has shown up. And for whatever reason this stood out to me. And I suppose I felt the universe asking me to let you know this: \n\nAllow failure , to be what it is. It\u2019s sucks. Especially when you\u2019ve worked your ass off and you don\u2019t understand the reasons  why. Sometimes failure doesn\u2019t look anything you did. Sometimes it looks like doing everything right just to not have it work out. \n\nSometimes in that moment you really feel like \u201cwell shit\u201d now what am I gonna do. And not so much a back up plan place, But a real, what the fuck do I do now place. Man, some of the absolutely best things that have ever happened to me have come after failure, or disappointment. \n\nNo greater fire under you for success and actualization of  your dreams gets lit than in these moments. Be proud of the work you did and how you did it. Regardless of getting in or not, you kicked some serious ass and you\u2019re one hell of a student also. \n\nGo find something out of the box you wouldnt expect, go take a random job. Go fight fire for a summer, go learn a language, go do anything that ignites fire and passion in you. \n\nFailure is never the end, always the start. \n\n\nGood luck homie, \n\n- random stoned 30 year old from slo.",

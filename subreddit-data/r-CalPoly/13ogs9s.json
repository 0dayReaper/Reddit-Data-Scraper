    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently got accepted into SLO Architecture and I am looking for a roommate that is apart of CAED(College of Architecture and Environmental Design). This is more convenient for me as I am apart of SLO's two year housing program. As a person, I'm a well rounded person who knows how to balance studies and activities outside of school. I'm always welcoming challenges and finding new ways to expand my skill sets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested please let me know!",

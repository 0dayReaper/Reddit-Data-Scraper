    "postText": "Academically, Cal Poly seems like the obvious choice, but I'm a little bit unsure if it's worth going to a school with the main focus being STEM. I plan on going to law school at some point, so I just thought that English was a solid major, although I know that your major doesn't really matter when applying, I just thought it would be more helpful. CSUN is much, much cheaper, I get to stay home since I'm like 20-30 minutes away, and it's not a bad school by any means. Cost is pretty important to me because spending so much money on an English major doesn't feel right. Plus I'm wondering how many internship opportunities there are in a small town like SLO. I like that you get to engage with the professors, which should help with letters of rec. Someone please enlighten me and help me out, thank you.",

            "comment": "I'm local to CSUN as well (born and raised in the Valley). Most of my middle school and highschool friends went there and I have sat in on a few classes for fun with those same friends.\n\nFull stop, do not go to CSUN if your choice is Cal Poly vs CSUN. If its between CSUN and the other schools you mentioned, I'd choose CSUN ONLY for the cost saving.\n\nCSUN is not a good school overall. Not academically, not socially, not in terms of career advancement opportunities, and not in terms of professional networking. You can clearly see this in student body quality and career placement (I am now 6 years post-undergrad so I've seen how my entire elementary, middle, and high school peers are doing in their professional life after CSUN).\n\nOf course, there are a handful successful people out of there but those people had to work much, much harder and would have been successful independent of where they went to school.\n\nThere are three major things I want to bring to your attention:\n\n1. Money. CSUN is significantly cheaper for obvious reasons. However, money comes and goes throughout your life. The price difference is a lot now but it's less than nothing when you begin working. Even getting a minimum wage job nets you well over that amount a year (over $30k in Cali). That amount of money won't be an issue post graduation, and honestly it isn't even an issue during school if you take out loans (I worked ~30 hours a week and took out loans to get through uni). You have a long time to make up that cash. Also, you should get a job while in school to make money, learn financial responsibility, make friends.\n\n2. Moving away for college is invaluable. Growing up and finding yourself alongside your peers is literally life changing. This is your first time out being independent. You learn responsibility, accountability, and build life-long relationships. I promise you that you will never again have as much free time as you did when you were in college. Likewise, you'll never have such low stake responsibilities than during that time in your life. The most important part of college imo is making friends, learning to be an adult, and discovering yourself. CSUN is a commuter school. Something like 80%+ of the kids commute. There is no social life on or off campus. It's not easy to make friends and difficult to force friendships when everyone lives at home with mom and is only ever near campus (or Northridge, at all) for classes. Dorming or moving away to college at this age is a once in a lifetime experience and strongly encourage anyone who has the chance to take it. The school loans are absolutely worth it.\n\n3. Demographic and Geography. I think this is something you need to be aware of and seriously consider. Another prospective student started a discussion post on this recently. You should read it, I think its very valuable. I even commented my thoughts on there. Link: https://old.reddit.com/r/CalPoly/comments/11zbdy0/poc_at_slo/\n\nas a tl;dr on point 3 -- Overwhelming majority of people are well off and white. SLO is in the middle of no where and there is no notable city for at least 100 miles. No culture in the county and it will be VERY different from what you're used to. The people arent mean or racist, but a lot of them are uninformed and not super accommodating.\n\nAdmittedly, an English major is harder to argue for but the advice I gave is agnostic of major. Personally I did not like SLO and did not vibe with the geography or people. That said, I loved my college EXPERIENCE. I'm proud of the adult I grew into, I made some great life-long friends, and I have a strong professional network and a decent job.",

Ignore the loans, look at the total grants (and realize you can often squeeze a bit more.).    Then see what you really need to invest.  \n\nMy guess is that an English major at SLO wont be seen externally as much better than one from CSUN.    But what you get out of it is more important.\n\nIf you have good home support, and are happy there, and don\u2019t need the \u201caway from home\u201d experience, CSUN is a good school \u2014 if you make the effort for it to be.   I have a recent CSUN grad here, and she is happy to have her BA, free housing, and no loans.    And I have another student who cant wait to start  SLO in a few weeks.",

Going to graduate this upcoming June with ~25k debt. Would've been alot higher if covid didn't happen. In comparison to CSUN, I would've been getting paid $1k every semester from financial aid and graduate debt free. The market being bad and my lack of internship experience has made job hunting difficult for me. For reference, I'm an engineering major.\n\nIt seems that you're going to be an english major. Imo, I would just go to CSUN because that major doesn't have have a high return of investment(ROI) post college. Not worth going into massive debt. When I has in HS, some of my english teachers and a couple of other teacher went to CSUN. You can try asking them about your situation and get advice from them. \n\nI can't really speak of the opportunities Cal Poly has for english majors. Even then, I wouldn't risk going into massive debt unless you're going to attend a tier 1 UC or some brand name University.",

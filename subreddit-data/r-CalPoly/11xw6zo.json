Data Science minor \n2. Is it possible to a double minor in Data Science and Comp Sci? \n3. Data Science and Coding clubs?\n\nAny advice? Any thing I can prep before going?",

                    "comment": "Direct major is somewhat precluded by the upcoming switch to semesters, so CDSM (Cross-Disciplinary Studies Minor) in Data Science is *it* at the moment.\n\nHaving said that, realize that BS in Data Science would be 180 units, of which about half would be  major courses.  BS in Stat + CDSM in Data Science is more like 192 units, and all the extra units are relevant to the degree.  So, you are getting more education in the latter case.\n\nThe data science program is best viewed in conjunction with your major in Stats (or CS), which is what makes it different from, e.g., a minor you can get in an unrelated field.  So, BS in Stat + CDSM in Data Science  give you a decent in-depth experience.",

It will take time, but what we have right now is actually a stronger program than *most* of BS in Data Science degrees around the country. Just do a course-by-course comparison.",

However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to do a CS minor unless you find interest in CS courses outside of what\u2019s required for the DS minor. \n\nSpeak to an advisor or the respective minor coordinators. Good luck.",

Then in second year take CSC 202 in Fall and DATA 301 in Winter (or Spring), after which you can get \"officially admitted\" into the program.",

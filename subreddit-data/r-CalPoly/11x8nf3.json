Got lucky enough to figure out the right major for me and switched winter of freshman year.\n\nI can give you some advice on different majors but it depends what you find interesting. Do you like science and want to do cool labs and chemistry and stuff? Do you like engineering and technical stuff? Lots of labs there too. Do you find big machinery interesting? Those are some of the technical directions you can go here, but there\u2019s also a finance, marketing, and people management direction. If you want a happy medium of all that oooh baby then Ag Systems Management is the right place for you. \n\nBut yeah what do you want to explore OP?",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do right now. I\u2019m in big trouble. I think I most likely have to do an incomplete or an emergency withdrawal for a class. (I\u2019m not even sure if an emergency withdrawal is possible anymore since it\u2019s the last day of finals week.) I completed the midterm and quizzes. I have a makeup final scheduled in two hours and I\u2019m not even sure if I should still bother taking it. However, this class has two 750-word research-based writing assignments that are also worth a pretty significant part of my grade and I have only barely started on one of them. One of them was due around the same time as the midterm, but my professor gave me extra time to finish it and just told me to submit it \u201cwhen I am able\u201d. I definitely don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to complete both without failing or at least doing really poorly on one of the other two classes I\u2019m taking as I also have a considerable amount of work to do in those classes by the end of this weekend. I\u2019m even doubting my ability to finish one given that I am so drained of energy right now. This class is a GE and the other two classes are major classes.\n\nThis quarter (like most of my quarters in college) has been a real s***show. I had COVID-19 for two weeks in mid-February. This is what affected my ability to do the midterm and the first writing assignment. I also had ongoing issues with fatigue and head pain but that might have to do with bad habits like being cooped up in bed on my phone a lot. Overall, I found it really difficult to be invested in my classes and put in effort and it was especially bad this quarter. Literally any assignment that wasn\u2019t taking notes, filling out a form, or following step by step instructions meant an all-nighter the night of the deadline. In fact I\u2019ve had at least 20 all-nighters this quarter and my sleep schedule is extremely messed up. In general I am just a really bad student. I have always been awful at time management and self-discipline. I would be significantly late or absent to plenty of classes, especially my two major related ones which all started at 8 AM and lasted between 3-4 hours. I had trouble taking my classwork seriously. Even taking attending lectures seriously. I didn\u2019t feel accountability for a while. I was often too shy to ask for help even if I needed it almost every day at times. I am used to cooping up in my room whenever possible. I think it might have been especially bad this quarter because I was taking classes that were harder and more involved than I\u2019d taken in a while. This was the first quarter I had after switching majors, as for the previous few quarters, I\u2019d been dabbling around different majors with no clear direction. In fact, I have already not been feeling that great about my new major since winter break, and there\u2019s a specific major I regret not choosing instead, but I fear that it\u2019s too late since this is already my third year here, I\u2019m a year behind, and switching to that other  major could extend my graduation to six or seven years. Most of my time went into my major classes and I frequently had no time left for this GE class. I took 3 classes and still feel like it might have been too much for me to handle. My mental health has never been great either. Also for what it\u2019s worth I do have learning disabilities.\n\nThe reason I didn\u2019t do this earlier in case you were wondering was out of fear along with typical procrastination. I had already withdrawn from a few classes and done a few incompletes in the past so I was afraid it would look bad. Also I believe they have a limit on how many units you can withdraw from during your time at the university and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m approaching that limit. I wanted to believe I had things figured out by this year or this quarter but I really didn\u2019t. In fact, I think I\u2019ve gotten worse since my first year. I need to stop lying to myself. I had plans the past few weeks to buckle down on those writing assignments in this class, but it kept on getting pushed aside because I had to spend more time on the more urgent assignments in my major classes, which I was also behind on. I needed to pass those two classes to move on to the ones next quarter. For a while I was in the mindset that I\u2019d be able to find that big block of time and come through so the incomplete or withdrawal wouldn\u2019t even be in the conversation. So I pushed forward with the class. That never happened. Now I\u2019m f***ed.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what I should do at this point. I am certain I won\u2019t be able to do both of those writing assignments I need and pass my other two classes. The professor isn\u2019t responding. Would an advisor be able to help? Do you think an incomplete would be possible or if there is anything I can do except do what I can and probably fail? (If I fail, I am fearing my GPA will not be competitive enough for internships until I retake this class, and I am in the middle of applying for them this summer.)\n\nUpdate: Professor finally replied and let me take an incomplete.",

They've experienced difficulties this quarter, including dealing with COVID-19, poor time management, and mental health issues. They have a makeup final scheduled soon but doubt their ability to complete the required work for their classes.\n\n&gt; The student is in their third year and has already switched majors, which has set them behind. They have a history of withdrawing from classes and fear they are nearing the university's withdrawal limit. Most of their time and energy has been dedicated to their major classes, leaving the GE class unattended.\n\n&gt; The student's academic performance has worsened since their first year, and they are now facing the possibility of failing the GE class. They are concerned about how this might affect their GPA and internship prospects. The student is unsure whether to seek an incomplete, emergency withdrawal, or another solution, and is considering reaching out to an advisor for guidance.\n\nHave you tried grade forgiveness?\nhttps://registrar.calpoly.edu/repeats",

Just know that I\u2019ve seen many people go through periods in life which are similar, and years later are just fine, or better! College is not always a straight path to anywhere! I would also urge you to reach out to some of the very good mental health counselors to help with all this you are going through right now. Maybe you can take a quarter off to regroup or work, to give yourself time to get a fresh perspective.",

    "postText": "Parent here - had been happily following along and thinking DS was leaning towards Cal Poly vs. the in-state option, and then came across postings with upset parents about students dealing with lots of async/online courses. Is this the case? DS is coming in as a CS major. I wish this question had come up at the Open House - but in any case, please comment what the real situation is. (I want to be very aware of what we might be getting into: very hard to pay OOS prices if classes are mostly online with no strong promise of a better future)",

            "comment": "things are mostly transitioned back to in person, and (hopefully) the frost center being finished means some larger lectures will move back in person. async/online courses are generally reserved for the \"easier\" classes like ges and some 100/200-level major courses (key word being generally, exceptions do exist).  \n\n\neither way, i think DS's biggest issue is getting CS courses, since CS is really impacted getting courses might be difficult, but our program is well worth it for its rigor and insane networking opportunities. companies actively clamor for cal poly students as interns and will actively seek out when our career fairs are so they will be at them.",

Unless he\u2019s blocked into one first quarter (which he can drop if he wants), then it\u2019s up to him whether he takes one or not. I\u2019ve found that they\u2019re pretty hard to get into when registration comes around because a bunch of students like the format. I know of one girl who had 3 async / online classes. \n\nI only had one, for my one hour discussion class for psych fall q, and I don\u2019t plan on registering in one again. \n\nAlso, with a hands on major like CS, I highly doubt any of his major / support classes will be online. There\u2019s a stat somewhere on Cal Polys website about how many classes are offered in what format, and async / online is less than 5 percent I think.",

            "comment": "My D is currently a freshman and had one asynchronous class- a public speaking class, ironically. She considered trying to switch to in/person but was advised against it since the class is required for so many majors and she risked not getting it this yr if she opted out of the class to find another. Freshmen are block-scheduled into their classes by their departments for most of the first 3 quarters. She survived the class and has not had any other asynchronous, mostly bc she is averse to online learning since the pandemic. Many students like the flexibility tho (watch lectures at your leisure). I wouldn\u2019t worry about it if I were you/your son.",

            "comment": "1st year OOS SWE major and I had synchronous virtual ethnic studies and an asynch psych class.  I was worried at first about the formats but actually happy in the end I was blocked into both of them.  My virtual ethnic studies class was from 4-6pm and was nice to be able to go back to my dorm room at the end of the day to take this class and the asynch psych class has less busy work/time consuming  than the in person class so that is a huge plus as an engineering student.   Also, remember classes meet longer and more frequently since Cal Poly is on the quarter system on top of the majority of non GE classes all have labs so those classes are two hours long.  Trust me it\u2019s nice to have flexibility and the virtual/hybrid/asynch classes are very doable.  Your student will have math, science and major classes all in person. As you can see he might or might not be blocked into one of these classes and if he does he just needs to find another class as soon as enrollment opens up for him to switch into.",

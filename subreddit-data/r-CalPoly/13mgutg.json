    "postText": "I'm considering withdrawing from the course I'm taking this quarter, and that would make my total unit below 12 units, which would make me a half-time student instead of a full-time. Would there be any consequence of the status change? (For financial aid, I didn't accept any loans and scholarships)",

            "comment": "For Housing, they put in the contract you have to be enrolled in at least 8 units, so if you\u2019re dropping from 12 to 8, they won\u2019t kick you out. Even if it was below that, Housing in general tries to avoid having their students go homeless, so you\u2019d be fine either way.\n\nWith Financial Aid, as long as you don\u2019t drop to 0, you\u2019ll be fine there too. As long as you attempted full time units by the add/drop deadline (12+), then that\u2019s what matters. However, keep in mind that by the end of the first academic year (and quarters moving forward), you\u2019ll need to be passing 67% of all attempted units, and withdrawals do affect this. It\u2019s called SAP. \n\nChat with your advisor if there are any other things at play, but you\u2019ll be fine if you need to withdrawal. I see it happen all the day\u2014 every student is always fine",

If you were passing the rest of your classes this quarter, and in the last two, you should be way above that 67% pass requirement, so you\u2019ll still have Financial Aid for next quarter. And as long as your CPSLO GPA is also above a 2.0, expect your financial aid to still continue throughout next year!\n\nYou will only ever have to pay back financial aid for a quarter if you take a term withdrawal (withdrawing from all courses that quarter after add/drop).\n\nAs of right now, since we\u2019re past the end of Week 7, the only type of withdrawal you can submit is an emergency withdrawal, so you may have to speak on circumstances out of your control, potentially with things back home, medical, or related to mental health. Sometimes they may ask for documentation, other times they won\u2019t. Withdrawing is never a guaranteed, but the wording of your reason for withdrawing is pretty important.",

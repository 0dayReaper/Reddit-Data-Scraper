    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI\u2019m a prospective student and I have a few questions about Cal Poly. I\u2019m a stats major and would like to pursue a career in Data Science.\n\n1. What are the benefits of the Learn By Doing philosophy, specifically for a Stats major?\n\n2. Are there specific benefits to the Stats program here compared to other schools(like UCs for example)?\n\n3. What is the student culture in relation to class work(mostly individual, collaborative, mix of both)?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "1. While I am not a stats major, the learn by doing philosophy really shows, especially when doing labs for the sciences. There is a lot of equipment for the sciences, and you really do quite a bit of hands on work for your classes.\n\n2. I don't know the benefits of the stats department against other schools, but I've heard that ours is pretty good.\n\n3. I'd say that the relations for class work really depends on the teacher, but there are plenty of spaces that you could go to with your group to study or do work.",

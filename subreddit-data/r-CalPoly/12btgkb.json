    "postText": "Our son was waitlisted for Cal Poly. He did get into Texas AM. We know Texas AM is great and we know it's a great opportunity. However, we are out of state (CA) and his #1 choice is Cal Poly SLO.\n\nCal Poly SLO as well as a few other CA schools waitlisted him. The only 2 CA schools he was admitted to was Cal Lutheran (Physics) with a scholarship making it pretty cheap actually (He will also play water polo if he attends CLU and Cal Maritime (he isn't sure about it yet, he is going to visit, etc on April 22) and he would play polo there as well.\n\nPolo is not a must for him. If he goes to AM he may play club and would play club at Cal Poly too. He is looking for school first and if they have water polo then he will play if possible.  \n\n\nThe cost of out-of-state at Texas AM has us worried despite knowing it is also a solid second option. He will definitely use loans to do that and we just aren't sure if it's the best option out of all--all of this becomes moot if he does somehow get into Cal Poly from the waitlist but won't really know for a while).:  \n1. attend Texas AM despite out-of-state costs  \n2. attend CLU and play water polo at a very reduced cost (will have to major in physics bc no engineering)  \n3. attend Cuesta JC, play polo (ensures first choice in classes also), and hope to transfer to Cal Poly later  \n4. Maybe Cal-Maritime. Currently mixed on it but should be more clear after May 22.  \n\n\nAny advice is welcomed.",

Clearly these are answers that only he can make and then mix in the financial ramifications of those answers. The cost of college has ballooned and less debt it always the best route, including just getting rid of your GEs and then transferring from a community college.",

If you are in state I would take that into consideration along with other higher costs on the coast (generally gas for a car and water/sewer utility rates are also higher). But he still needs to figure out what the ultimate goal post college is.",

What about investigating the transfer guarantee from community college to a UC?",

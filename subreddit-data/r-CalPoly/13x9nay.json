If I have an hour or two break between classes/meetings I will literally go drive somewhere else. \n\nI want to like Cal Poly and going here but sometimes I really wish I could just reset my mindset so I could actually enjoy being around. My happiness studying literally anywhere else vs at Cal Poly is so different :/ \n\nI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to get through another 2 years. How do I like being at school? :(((",

It might help to have something positive or that you enjoy associated with campus so you can start attaching new sentiments to campus. Otherwise, I don\u2019t really see a problem with studying off campus! There are a lot of choices in SLO.",

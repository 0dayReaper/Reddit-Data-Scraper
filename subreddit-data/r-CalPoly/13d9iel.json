This means you\u2019ll stay in your current major. You can apply to switch to other majors in the future, but you\u2019re only allowed one attempt to change into a given major so any future attempts would have to be to switch to something else.   If you\u2019re very close to meeting the requirements of your ICMA, talk to the ICMA advisor about whether you can satisfy it with a different class or other options.",

I\u2019ve heard Red Bricks, Sierra Madre, and Yosemite can be extremely social since the spaces are so small. yak\u0294it\u02b8ut\u02b8u dorms really can depend since they have a lot more space. Some are quiet and other are social. It\u2019s also one of the best dorms since it is new (2019), but overall nice!",

I also love SLO because you can socialize outside of the party scene thanks to all of the clubs and beautiful area around; the amount of group hikes, beach days, and coffee shop visits I go on far out-number the parties I go to and I typically enjoy them more because of personal preference.",

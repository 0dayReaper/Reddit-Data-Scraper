Will there be separate virtual rooms they put the parents in or will everyone receive the same information for entire Zoom meeting?",

But if it\u2019s not that important to them/you, they can hear what information you\u2019re getting in your zoom sessions",

Some of those sessions have the same info for parents and students like the basics about Cal Poly, but some of them are very different - focused on group bonding and college life for students, and focused on things like safety and the emotional aspects of starting college for parents. So, if they\u2019re really into it, I would encourage them to sign up for the supporter pass (just one is plenty ofc) so they can be a part of the sessions that are aimed solely at parents",

You\u2019ll be surrounded with a ton of like-minded individuals academically, and the course scheduling load is more similar across students, making it easier to make friends and party. Engineering majors aren\u2019t given credit for being partiers lmao",

You can choose a learning community with a lot of people angling towards yak\u0294it\u02b8ut\u02b8u because it is new, but you'll make great friends at any of them. Something about shared misery creating bonds for life! \n\nSince you're extroverted you'll make friends, but getting a group of dorm mates to all go to dinner early on is key. So is joining clubs. If you did a sport in high school you should seek out joining the club team or if you really want to bond see if any ofthe 13 official CalPoly Athletic teams take walk ons.\n\nhttp://www.housing.calpoly.edu/content/res_life/living_learning",

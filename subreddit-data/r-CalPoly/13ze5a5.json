            "comment": "I had a very similar conundrum when I was considering school. Lots of factors. I'm from Rocklin, so Davis would have been a 30-45 minute commute and I could have saved money on housing.\n\nThe Computer Science and Engineering staff are great at Cal Poly. It's a fantastic school, but I can't speak to experience with Davis or anyone I know who went to Davis for Computer Engineering.\n\nDavis would be a little more leaning towards academic research and abstracted higher learning, if research is more your style rather than practical hands-on stuff more focused on getting employment - https://ece.ucdavis.edu/faculty-research\n\nDavis is straight-up more expensive than Cal Poly. Even with scholarships, it was more expensive. [Cost of attendance living at home for UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/admissions/cost) was still more expensive than [cost of attendance living on-campus at Cal Poly](https://www.calpoly.edu/financial-aid/costs-and-affordability/undergraduate-costs-of-attendance). If you have scholarships to either, this may shift favor one way or the other.\n\nCal Poly is in a beautiful area and it's an entirely new place, as opposed to being in a familiar place living at home. While some would suggest staying at home and saving money, the extra life experience and new social groups you form by moving out and going to college is a one-time invaluable thing.\n\nIf you stay in the area and are a commuter student, it might be harder to form bonds with your colleagues and peers on-campus, while at the same time you might latch onto bonds you form with your old friends/classmates from high school.\n\nCal Poly is very walkable, while Davis moreso feels like it requires a bike depending on luck of the draw with classes. Also, when I toured Davis, it entirely smelled like cow shit while Cal Poly only smelled like cow shit in certain parts of campus where the AG stuff was. I have no idea if this holds true in general circumstances.\n\nGood luck! I'm sure if you go to the UC Davis subreddit you will invariably find someone who had a similar decision, it's a pretty common one to make for local university vs distant one.",

Both schools over admit making a much more crowded campus and very large class sizes and making it considerably harder to graduate with in four years even for transfer students.",

I won\u2019t talk about stuff like tuition, campus, location, etc cause ultimately that is definitely up to you. Cal polys biggest strength is the faculty-student relations. CPE only recently became a department in like 2021 and we\u2019re still quite small. What that does mean tho is that your classes are like high school. You see many of the same people and develop close relationships with professors. Our professors are great and they\u2019re all experienced professionals in the field. IMO, that\u2019s our biggest strength + practical experience and a lot of big tech companies have a vested interested in the students here. Lots of companies specifically pay attention for Cal Poly students.\n\nOne thing to note that is pretty big is that Cal Poly will be switching to a semester system (currently quarter) in 2026. That may affect you and your decision so it\u2019s best to know",

            "comment": "You asked in the slo subreddit but taking away the bias you will be happier you went to slo. The professors and curriculum are designed for you to succeed and take away applicable knowledge for industry. Being a Computer Engineer, even failing classes I learned valuable information that will be wildly important when I graduate. Just beware CPE is a very challenging major as are most engineering majors, but the professors will help you as long as you show interest and passion. The example I point to is a Professor Callenes at SLO. He teaches upper division Computer engineering classes and he is easily the most understanding when it comes to working and assigning projects/assignments. He, like many other faculty, will try their best to ensure your success in their class because they value their students moving onto greater things",

            "comment": "This was about 20 years ago but I went to Cal Poly and my husband went to Davis. We both have degrees from the same department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Cal Poly\u2019s philosophy is learn by doing. It is hands on and taught by the professors. The classes are smaller and I got to know my professors personally. A number of them were at our wedding.  He had the opposite experience.  He was just a number in his classes. The professors were focused on their research. His labs were taught by TAs. He had to teach himself mostly.   I had a number of engineering friends at Poly and they had similar great experiences as well. Good luck the drive from Rocklin to SLO is only about 4.5-5 down 101.",

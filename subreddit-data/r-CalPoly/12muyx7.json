    "postText": "i was admitted to these three schools as a biology major and am having a hard time deciding. i\u2019m not pre-med but am interested in grad school in the future and going into research, possibly related to ecology, wildlife, or marine science. i\u2019m out of state, so overall ucsd and ucsb would cost about 70k a year and cal poly would be about 50k. \n\n- ucsd is ranked highest for bio and seems to have the most opportunities and research, however it\u2019s expensive and i\u2019ve heard it\u2019s socially dead and i\u2019m worried i\u2019d just be stressed and unhappy there. \n- ucsb has a strong bio program as well, good research opportunities for undergrad bc they don\u2019t have many graduate students, an amazing social life and location, however expensive as well.\n- cal poly has the best value, lowest cost, smaller class sizes, more of an undergrad focus like ucsb and seems kind of a happy medium of academics and social life, however it\u2019s not super diverse, isn\u2019t a \u201cresearch university\u201d like ucsb and ucsd and is in a smaller town so probably has less opportunities overall. \n\nas someone considering grad school and a career in research which should i choose? i can\u2019t tell if it\u2019d be a bad idea to pick cal poly bc it\u2019s not a research university or a bad idea to pick ucsd/ucsb bc they\u2019d cost so much for undergrad.",

            "comment": "I would agree with most comments that generally it\u2019s easier to get involved in research here than at others schools. However, one caveat is that calpoly doesn\u2019t really compare to the actual research diversity or the prestige at lest in my field to UCSD. My field of interest is bioinformatics for example and UCSD blows calpoly out of the water with faculty members such as pevzner, rob knight, Alexandrov, Bafna, etc etc. Point is, is that UCSD faculty is extremely impressive and if you can get a  rec letter from them it\u2019ll be extremely valuable. On the other hand we don\u2019t really have a bioinformatics department and we definitely don\u2019t compare to UCSD at all. So in this aspect, UCSD will help you more. \n\n\nAlso one other pro for UCSD and probably UCSB is that there\u2019s a lot more course diversity as in you can take classs at UCSD that aren\u2019t offered at calpoly. It\u2019s probably due to UCSD just being a bigger bio department. \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s the other argument though that calpoly has the more undergrad experience with smaller class room sizes too which ngl is really valuable since you can meet people and connect with faculty more. You\u2019ll also get the chance to get stronger faculty rec letters especially if you start hella early.\n\n\n\nSocially, I think it\u2019s what you make of. I know people at calpoly that don\u2019t have great social lives and I know people at UCSD that have great social lives so going to one school or another won\u2019t prevent you from having a great one. \n\n\n\nOverall, I think if you should talk to more students definitely and it\u2019s a choice though you can\u2019t really go wrong. It\u2019ll also probably depend on what field you\u2019re interested since biology is enormous and what factors of each school ultimately attract you the most",

Almost everyone in all my classes has participated in or is actively in research. I'm a graduating biology major, and got offered a spot doing paid summer research. Cal poly definitely has more research for undergrads than other schools",

I\u2019d say Cal Poly is a great choice for undergrad research because its emphasis on undergrad education. Its not uncommon for people to start on it their first year, and you get to interact more with professors since they\u2019re focused on teaching unlike at UC schools.",

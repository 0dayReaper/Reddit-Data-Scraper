            "comment": "I was in a similar spot to you last year. Ultimately I went for slo because of location and less of a housing problem (as long as you're on top of it and find solid roommates it's usually not a huge issue, whereas ucsc has the highest homelessness rate of the UCs). \n\nI can't make this decision for you, but as someone in the chemistry major right now, I can say that the opportunities for research and classroom experience is unmatched by ucsc. Cal Poly takes \"Learn by Doing\" *very* seriously, and it's evident in where they put their money. A brand new research center just opened up. \n\nNot just that, but Cal Poly has very few graduate students compared to undergrad. There's only like 900 compared to the 20,000 undergrads. This means that you're usually able to get into research way sooner because you're not competing against graduate students for slots. Also, I would look into how intro chem / bio classes are taught at UCSC. Here, they're all taught by lecturers / professors, not TAs. Also, the first 2 gen chems are taught in a studio classroom instead of a lecture hall, which was really nice. \n\nThis is just a rundown on why I would choose cal poly over ucsc, but ultimately it's up to you and where you feel the best going! Santa Cruz is also a very beautiful area, and you really can't beat the banana slug as a mascot. \n\nFeel free to PM if you have any other questions.",

            "comment": "Hi there, a bit of serendipity here since I graduated from UCSC with a bs in chem. I transfered in so I didn't have first hand experience with intro chem class professors, but I did TA for organic chem and work with a gen chem professor. I do recommend the school for chem/biochem studies. I know it's not exactly what you are shooting for but that's all I can attest to. from the few bio student I knew they seemed to enjoy it but biology is usually impacted at any school so be aware of that since you'll be needing those classes.\n\nFairly good research opportunities here but I would check out the faculty research pages to see if anything sounds interesting to you first. I would do this to both schools if you haven't already :)\n\nAbout the school: Freshman and sophomores don't get to have cars on campus if you planned on living on campus so keep that in mind. You can get a lot pass if you commute but it's generally not close to main buildings. There are buses but it's usually a shit show. It's hilly AF and spread out so you'll earn your title as a member of UC sexy calves if you come here. It's a nice mix of new buildings with old not so new buildings. It's in a freaking forest. Lots of rain, fog, and turkeys. Power goes out frequently in Santa Cruz but most buildings have back up power. Anyway I'm tired and rambling so I'll stop there.",

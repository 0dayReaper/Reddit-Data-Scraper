At every other place, a midterm was only used to mean a single exam that comes near the middle of the term. It is in contrast to a final. If the class has multiple tests, they were called exams because multiple \"midterms\" is nonsensical.\n\n[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/midterm](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/midterm)\n\nI see students and faculty use this word incorrectly. Fight me.",

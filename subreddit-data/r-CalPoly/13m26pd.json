    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m an incoming freshman (Male) at slo and looking for a third roommate. I understand we're like 10 days out from the deadline so not expecting much but my roommate and I will be dorming in COSAM as our first choice and probably CENG as the second. We're flexible though so honestly down for anything. \n\nFor anyone that doesn't know already when housing appointments are sent out, the Cal Poly housing website states, \"Three-person groups will go first, followed by two-person groups and then individuals.\u00a0\" So especially if you're going in as random looking to meet new people stop thinkin that much and give us a chance \ud83d\udc80. My roommate and I are chill asf, not super partiers, supportive, and clean. \n\nLmk as soon as possible if you're interested and I'll also buy you boba lmaooo",

If you choose not to use public transport, you will probably want a parking pass. Metered parking is typically time limited (30 min - 4 hours depending on the space) and there aren\u2019t that many spaces, so if you\u2019re spending full days on campus you\u2019ll want a permit. If you have friends/acquaintances who also live in Los osos, you could split a parking permit and take turns driving? I thing you can put at least 2, maybe 3 cars on each permit.",

But a good idea to carpool- my program has a small cohort so we\u2019ll be spending all our time together I bet we could arrange a parking pass for a group of us to share.",

It hurts paying the yearly commuter pass but don\u2019t have to worry about that. Also if you\u2019re in Los Osos, RTA bus doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea - tho it was for me because it turned a 45-55min commute to 3hrs.",

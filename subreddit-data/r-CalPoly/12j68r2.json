I am not completely certain I want to study engineering, but I am definitely interested in it. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I might make this decision or any insight into why one option might be better than the other? Thank you!",

I was arguing that those factors don\u2019t necessarily make UCB \u201cmuch better\u201d for CS on the undergrad level. As a grad, UCB is better no question asked (our grad department is basically undergrad+). But if one wants a solid undergrad education, I believe Cal Poly is better equipped to provide that to its students *on average* there\u2019s no denying that there are more prestigious opportunities at UCB, but as far as whether one can actually take advantage of those is debatable. Cal Poly, while being less prestigious and interesting, can easily have you end up in the exact same place as top UCB students or even ahead of many of them. Cal Poly has got TONS of issues, but one thing they nail is ensuring their students learn the fundamentals of CS damn well. Again, this is my opinion based off of hearing what UCs academic environment is like and experiencing the CS classes here at Cal Poly.",

Better class sizes and more hands on, the professors here really help you learn and are super knowledgeable. Prestige doesnt matter after like 1 year and even then both schools are very high ranking for CS programs.\n\nNot to mention a cleaner safer area that\u2019s extremely beautiful to live in.",

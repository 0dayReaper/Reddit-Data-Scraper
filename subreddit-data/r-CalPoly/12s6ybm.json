    "postText": "Hi guys, I'm an upcoming transfer student with a conditional admission. What does it mean? Under what reasons would they rescind it? I read it through and saw something about &gt;2.0 GPA and whatnot, but I still don't fully understand -- I'm just worried of my admission being rescinded after this semester at my community college. My GPA currently is 3.8 or so, but maybe after this semester it may drop down to 3.4 WORST case scenario or around 3.6 or 3.7. I really want to go to this school, just worried about grades.",

It\u2019s conditional because it\u2019s not a guaranteed admittance since you still need to send final transcripts and pass your current classes. I think In the portal Theres a link that shows the terms and condition of your acceptance. I\u2019m pretty sure it says that you need to like not fail any of your classes during spring semester. So getting a C or higher is fine. Your overall gpa is not factored. you\u2019re in, they just don\u2019t want you to be failing classes that they expect you to complete during this spring. You can get Bs and Cs this semester and still be fine since gpa isn\u2019t factored just the passing of the class. Also it\u2019s conditional since you wrote which classes you have taken in the application but they need an official transcript to verify your courses and all that.(to make sure that all the grades you said you got are legit). If somethings wrong then they have the ability to rescind your acceptance or at least talk to you about it idk. If I\u2019m mistaken someone let me know but that\u2019s my interpretation!",

(360k price tag for BC versus 120k for Cal Poly over 4 years)\n\nEdit: In hindsight, Cal Poly is a great school overall, and at its price point (assuming 0 aid) its probably the best bang for your buck nationwide. Outclassed by UCLA, Cal, UMich, etc but even in state its still 40k cheaper compare to UCs over 4 years.",

    "postText": "Incoming student here. I looked up the AP credit transfer amounts on College Board and saw that most every class is good for 9 elective units. But looking at the required credits for B-Arch there doesn't seem to be necessary elective units. I currently qualify for APUSH, AP World, and AP Lang. Would the units for those courses just go towards General Education? How exactly would those units be useful is ig what I'm asking. Thanks.",

If you're considered a Dependent Undergrad it's $5,500-$7,500 per year up to an aggregate max of $31,000. If you're an Independent Undergrad it's $9,500-$12,500 per year up to an aggregate max of $57,500.\n\nIf you're on your 3rd+ year as a dependent undergrad, the max they're allowed to give you is $7,500 for the academic year, and only $5,500 of that can be via subsidized loans within the year",

    "postText": "Hey r/CalPoly\n\nI was recently admitted and am currently debating between CP and my in-state school (UIChicago) and would appreciate some insight/info on what it's like. I've been reading around and just have some questions, any advice would be appreciated especially regarding pre-med and being an oos student!  \nsome context about UIC for reference:  \nit's an R1 research institution, but also have a larger class size (even for their honors program which I got into) but there are many hospitals nearby (many of which are highly ranked such as Rush and Lurie Children's both of which are research hospitals). My only concern with that is that I'd likely be competing for these positions against people who go to the other universities within the city such as UChicago and NU which have quite the reputation...  \nPRE MED CENTERED QUESTIONS:   \n1. how difficult is it to get those classes outside of my major? I've seen some concerns about not being able to get into classes...  \n2. how abundant are the research opportunities/does the local hospital also offer research/volunteer opportunities?  \nOUT OF STATE QUESTIONS:   \n3. would you say it's worth coming from out of state? My situation is a little strange because I have an autoimmune disease and am basically allergic to the cold and they're relatively similar cost-wise (excluding transportation) so I'm leaning yes here but always good to hear others' experiences.   \n4. What's the easiest way to get there/back home? This definitely depends from where you are from, but I didn't know if it'd be best to take the train to SF/LA then take the plane or just use the regional airport? Or is there a bus that goes to/from SLO to either major city?  \n\n\nSorry this ended up being quite the long post but thanks for taking the time to look at these questions!",

            "comment": "For #1, it depends on your major. if you\u2019re a bio major (probs most popular \u201cpremed\u201d major), then most of your reqs for premed (look up premed reqs cal poly to find the webpage for it) are in your major, making it easier to get into them than other majors. However (and someone please correct me if i\u2019m wrong), I believe that premed advisors can help you get into required premed classes with permission numbers and stuff if the seats aren\u2019t reserved for your major. I know people in wine and vit and english who are premeds. \n\nFor #2, the local hospital has volunteer positions that you could do. My roommate is premed and she\u2019s applying to volunteer there. I\u2019ve also heard of shadowing opportunities and the such, even as slo is a small town. for research, this is where cal poly shines. since it\u2019s so isolated, with only ~900 grad students (no PhDs either), it is a lot easier to become involved with research than it is at a doctoral granting institution. and yes, they do take \u201clearn by doing\u201d VERY seriously. \n\n2b) Cal Poly has a grant for research through the Frost Institute (I think it\u2019s called that?). Basically they give you a stipend to stay in slo over the summer and do research, usually through faculty. They also just opened (like literally yesterday) the Frost center for innovation, which is a research hub basically dedicated to undergrad research. I\u2019d recommend exploring the Frost program online. \n\n3. As a fellow out of state student, I\u2019d say that it would be no different than going to in state, except majority of people here are from California. Culture might be a bit of an adjustment but nothing too crazy. honestly the location is so special that I couldn\u2019t imagine going to my instate flagship even if it cost less. \n\n4. For transportation, this is definitely a little tricky. My hometown thankfully has a direct flight out of slo airport, so I just do that. I\u2019d look for connecting flight to chicago as your best bet, as getting to the major airports in California is a pain in the ass. I had to go back to one of my roommates places and fly out of her airport for thanksgiving break because I was late to book. As long as you\u2019re on top of booking flights, it shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem. \n\nfeel free to pm if you have other questions",

Southwest flies to Santa Barbara and has connecting flights to Midway. There is an Amtrak that goes to Santa Barbara. For direct flights, you have to go to SFO or LAX.",

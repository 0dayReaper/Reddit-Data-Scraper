    "postText": "Hello, everyone! I am currently enrolled in CSC 307, Intro to Software Engineering, taught by Professor Sanchez, which will commence this upcoming summer. I would like to inquire with fellow computer science and software engineering students who have previously taken this course. Could anyone please inform me of the programming language utilized in this class, as well as the type of projects that students will be working on? Thank you in advance!",

In this class, will we be learning the frameworks themselves through a project, or is it expected that we already have familiarity with them in order to perform well? I'm trying to determine whether I should drop the class if that's the case.",

            "comment": "Yes and No (copout I know). The school is smaller in size than other large state schools so it doesn't compete with the likes of SDSU or UCSB. However, the frat culture here is very much alive and also very concentrated around campus. The majority of parties here are frat parties (at least ones that are open). This can be good and bad. If you want to avoid it, it's fairly easy. However, if you want to go to a party or two a quarter, you have to find some other organization or person to host a house party. SLO being a small town also makes parties 'feel' bigger. Other than the outdoors, high end shopping, and food, SLO doesn't exactly have a lot of things that students can do every weekend. This helps make the drinking culture here fairly intense. That being said, I wouldn't call it a party school, but it DEFINITELY has an alive and well party scene. The Frat scene on campus is large, so if you wanna avoid it, be sure to join other clubs that can help you form a social group.",

Used to be less than 10 I think but people joined during Covid as a way to make friends without classes etc. I don\u2019t really know anyone except girls in sororities or frat guys themselves who ever went to frat events after freshman year tbh. People move off campus and have kickbacks at houses or apartments",

I see so many people wearing letters on campus and after the photos I saw of St. Frattys, that confirmed my personal views. Like I said, I think it\u2019s the proximity of fraternities that make them feel big. The school being small (for a state uni) also helps with this.",

Cal poly has Greek life presence, if that\u2019s your thing, but truly no one not in that small portion is really involved whatsoever in my experience, except a lot of girls go out to the frats freshman year. Once people move off campus, there\u2019s house parties, birthday parties, bar crawls, and kickbacks. The larger clubs like ski club, water ski, MPU, and the bigger sports teams like soccer/baseball/basketball/football all throw. Our class has 3 or 4 houses where big parties would get thrown completely independent of other organizations. St frattys is HUGE here, you can google it to see photos. Halloween is a big deal too. It\u2019s definitely a work hard, play hard school, where things are pretty dead weeks 4/5 and 8 and then finals unless there\u2019s a birthday/holiday/etc but there\u2019s always something to do if you know the right people. Once people turn 21 it trends towards the bars for sure though.",

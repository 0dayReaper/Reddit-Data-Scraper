            "comment": "Are you talking about 122 vs 123?  \n\n\n122 is properties of materials, fluids, waves and vibrations, sound, heat, light and optics.  \n123 is Electrostatics, electric current, magnetic fields and induction+ elements of modern physics.  \n\n\nSo, ok. Personally I enjoyed electricity &amp; magnetism more and the math wasn't too bad (except for Gauss's Law, that can eat it in my opinion.) I did not like fluids, waves, or light/optics. Material properties, sound, and heat were ok IMO.  \n\n\nIt's gonna be up to you, in the end. 123 also includes elements of modern physics, which sounds like they might introduce or even go into quantum mechanics a bit (not too heavy) but if you want to avoid that then avoid 123.",

Kinetic theory of matter, second law of thermodynamics. Geometrical and physical optics.\n\n143 (formerly 133) is charge and matter, electric field, electric potential, dielectrics, capacitance, current and resistance, electromotive force and circuits, magnetic fields, magnetic field of a moving charge, induced emf.  \n\n\nIt's the same idea. 143 is going to be all about electricity and magnetism. I personally liked those topics more than those in 142. Like I said though: temp/thermo (heat) wasn't too bad. Oscillations/optics/waves (in any media) sucked for me. So if I were making the choice I'd choose 143. But that's all I can say about it. Can't recommend profs for you, though, sorry. I took all this at a different school. Same topics tho.",

            "comment": "Physics 2 will be more relevant wherever you see waves and thermo, especially if you want to/have to take quantum (modern physics). If you want the trig help then go for it. Physics 3 makes a lot more sense if you\u2019re interested in any kind of electrical application because it can cement a low level knowledge of how circuits function and can perform. Physics 3 will be a handful of new equations as well so its a pick your own adventure. In my opinion phys 3 is a bit easier than 2. And if you can, take Professor Culbreath, that dude is the goat",

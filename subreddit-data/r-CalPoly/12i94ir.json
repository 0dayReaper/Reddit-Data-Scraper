    "postText": "Hi,  \n I\u2019m a 4th-year CPE student that\u2019s been actively job hunting since last September. Is anyone here that\u2019s in a similar situation interested in getting together to talk about the process or just have an overall support network? We can talk about resumes, upcoming interviews, the upcoming career fairs, what jobs we\u2019re applying for, give each other advice, rant, etc, etc. My current friends either have jobs lineup or aren\u2019t interested and so I\u2019ve been kinda lonely during this time.\n\nI\u2019d ideally would like to meet someone that's a similar major as me and is also actively looking for jobs. But I\u2019m open to about anyone who's doing something similar. Feel free to shoot me a DM and tell me more about yourself :)",

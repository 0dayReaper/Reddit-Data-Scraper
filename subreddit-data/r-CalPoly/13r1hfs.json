    "postText": "Is anyone minoring in entrepreneurship? I'm curious to know if pursuing an entrepreneurship minor is worthwhile, (I'm a CS major). My goal is to acquire knowledge about starting a startup and all the related aspects. I believe that taking entrepreneurship classes or minoring in entrepreneurship could be beneficial. Has anyone had any experience with the entrepreneurship classes at our school? What was your impression of them?  I'm wondering if minoring in entrepreneurship is the best choice to gain aspects revolving around startups and if it provides a comprehensive understanding of the entrepreneurial perspective.",

If you\u2019re on campus they have the Hatchery as well.\n\nAll in all, super great network of people, they\u2019ve helped my own startup get its first $15,000 all equity-free!",

Don\u2019t expect a single person or class to give u the 1 billion dollar idea. Learn to study many very different ideas. Be an academic but even more street smart.\n\nThese classes will expose you to some pretty interesting people introduce yourself to everyone otherwise u won\u2019t get much imo. \n\nGet ready breath and live ur product while trying to get others to love it even more. Feel free to connect on Linkedin",

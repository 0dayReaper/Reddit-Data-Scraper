Students who faithfully submitted an application to enroll and were getting ready to commit a year to this learning experience. I am so sorry this is happening. I am open to hearing your gripes but please don't feel compelled to consume the substitute inferior product! \n\nYou are always welcome to visit with me to discuss finance and career path all the same.\n\nBest\n\nProf. Ramezani",

I wish more tenured faculty would speak up with transparency about the political practices that occur in departments.  Folks like to blame administration for a lot of the corruptness; but folks in administrative positions (staff and even MPP) can lose their positions for something like this.  Tenured faculty are really the only ones that can speak freely on such matters.  That is probably why the university is constantly reducing tenure lines in favor of sub-contracting positions with part-time lecturers.",

    "postText": "All that fucking hard work for nothing. The overall experience is absolute trash but I thought, maybe, the reputation would save it but just look at that shit. 1 in 3. What the fuck. That's middle america tier. Just let anyone in! Worked hard? Come on in! Did you work just a bit more than usual? Come on in!\n\nI got fucking financial aid, they bought me the fuck out, but fuck this I should have gone to USC or UCLA and just take the L on the debt. All the sacrifices I made for prestige and money: working extremely hard for my  4.0 UW, giving up social life, giving up a dream school atmosphere and experience all for fucking nothing, all absolutely out the fucking window. When anyone can get in like this what's the point in working so hard to pull yourself out of the herd? Any fucking dumbass can make it in here. I am fucking done with this place.\n\nI'm going to be obsessed just to get post-graduate work so I can erase this embarrassment from my life.\n\nIf this was your \"target\" school and you made it in, congrats, but just to let you know as you have realized: you're not very ambitious and you settled for very little.",

These include, but are not limited to:\r  \n\r  \nRudeness towards other Redditors,\r  \n\r  \nSpreading incorrect information,\r  \n\r  \nSarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.\r  \n\r  \nAm I banned from the Reddit?\r  \nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\r  \n\r  \nI don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\r  \nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\r  \n\r  \nHow can I prevent this from happening in the future?\r  \nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",

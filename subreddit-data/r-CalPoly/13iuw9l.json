    "postText": "hello cal poly redditors. I'm a prospective freshman who was admitted as a GRC major, and I was initially hoping to pursue the UI/UX concentration. however, I've heard from a few people that the GRC program isn't very design-based, and the UI/UX concentration doesn't prepare you that well for UI/UX careers (tbh idk if people are just being haters or if this part is actually true)? so I'm sorta thinking that it could be a better option to switch my major to Art &amp; Design and concentrate in Graphic Design because it's more design-based + you're also required to take interaction design classes which I'd imagine would help in the UI/UX field. I was wondering if GRC as well as A&amp;D majors who are going into UI/UX, have had an internship in the field, and/or have a job lined up could weigh in and help me decide what the best choice would be for my future career path. thanks in advance, i really appreciate your help :)",

I can honestly say that their workshops/events teach you so many valuable hard skills like figma and prototyping. I personally chose ux (because I wanted to break into the tech industry) but I have a huge background in art &amp; design and I still feel like I am still able to fulfill my passion of designing (graphic design &amp; ux) with the grc curriculum.\n\nAlso don\u2019t let the early grc classes trick u, don\u2019t worry we ALL hated them.",

            "comment": "Hey, I\u2019m a 4th year GrC UI/UX and I founded a UX club here called Iter8 (you should definitely check us out on Instagram). Absolutely agree with the others, UX at GrC is not well developed. You\u2019ll get a good foundation in Adobe, print and packaging tech, and a little bit of typography and web development (which are all important), but you\u2019ll find that a lot of those classes won\u2019t help you build a good design portfolio (which is also important). \n\nStudents this year have given a lot of input to our GrC professors about this and they\u2019ve been pretty receptive, which will hopefully mean improvements for when Cal Poly switches to the semester system. GrC is a pretty light major, so many of us are able to pursue multiple minors or extra classes from other departments and concentrations (feel free to DM me for more specifics on this).\n\nClubs like Iter8 and UX Fest are stepping in in the meantime to get people on projects and build UX skills / complete portfolio projects. And we get a lot of interest from CS, LAES, Business, and A&amp;D which is great for collaboration. Getting involved in these clubs have been great for students career wise \u2014 I personally have gotten a job in UX and so have others at companies like Squarespace, Stubhub, Chegg, various design firms, etc.\n\nI\u2019d echo the others as well on checking out LAES and A&amp;D although they also have some pros and cons. LAES is essentially a \u201cbuild your own major\u201d which can cause some stress, and A&amp;D is struggling a bit with funding which affects class offerings. \n\nIf you choose GrC, be prepared to do some extra work outside of class to build a UX portfolio. But the great thing is that there are *a lot* of other students in the same boat, which will make it much easier to learn from each other.\n\nIf you want to talk more about this, feel free to send me a DM! \n\nAnd here\u2019s shameless plug for Iter8 \u2014 @calpolyiter8 on instagram :))",

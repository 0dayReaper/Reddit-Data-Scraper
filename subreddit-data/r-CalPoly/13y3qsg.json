            "comment": "For beginners Laguna Lake is close and does the trick, nothing to write home about though. Not a full size course and not exactly nice.\n\nDairy Creek is the closest full size course but is just 9 holes, tucked in the rolling green hills, pretty reasonably priced. \n\nMorro Bay is one of my favorite munis. Only like $20 for students to walk with views or the bay. Just beautiful.\n\nBest courses in the area are Hunter Ranch in Paso (35 min north), Monarch Dunes in Nipomo (30 min south, and Cypress Ridge in Arroyo Grande (20 min south). These are all full size, well kept, and more expensive, but still a great deal compared to equivalent courses in other parts of CA.",

Also the most expensive but 6 bucks more than Dairy for a prettier course and 9 more holes is more than justifiable. Dairy isn\u2019t awful either, and it\u2019s the closest to campus. Laguna is the cheapest but you get what you paid for in terms of quality.",

            "comment": "Monarch Dunes in Nipomo is expensive af (relative to the others listed here) but their 12-hole \"Challenge Course\" is a fun par 3 track. Much better than Laguna Lake if you've got the time to drive there and back. Plus they've got a proper range.\n\nChalk Mountain in Atascadero can get gnarly hot but it's a decent price for what it is. Hole 10 is kind of a clusterfuck though and there's a part during the back 9 where it's really easy to hit towards the wrong green by mistake.",

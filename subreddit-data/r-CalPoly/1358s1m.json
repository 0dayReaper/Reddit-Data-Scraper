I have never had an internship.\n\nIs it still possible for me to get into the software engineering field? or should I stick to what I originally wanted to do and do hardware.",

            "comment": "Here are some relatively unsolicited thoughts from a 1990 Cal Poly grad:  Do what inspires and fulfills you regardless of time and potential earnings.  Anything else will be a waste of your time. It took me 6 years and three major changes to find what I truly love and I have done it for 30+ years now.  At the three year mark I was just starting a Co-Op (do they still do those?) that introduced me to building construction and the rest of my career in structural engineering.  My advice, slow down, take some CPE courses.  If you like them, try to find an internship over the summer, if you still like what you find, pursue it with your heart, if not, don't mourn the time lost, consider it a valuable investment in getting it right.  Good luck, and enjoy.  You only get to take this ride once.",

Your resume might get autoscreened simply for have EE on your resume. This advice applies to career fairs where companies with software opportunities are likely to turn you away because of your EE background.",

            "comment": "Speaking from direct personal experience, the answer is yes it is absolutely possible.  I graduated from CP mid 90s and my entire career has been in software engineering.  Your first few jobs are probably going to be transitional so look for roles that involve hardware but require some software development.  For me it was system integration and testing.  From there work up the stack and prove yourself.  The more work experience you have the less the actual focus of your degree matters.  It took me about 3-4 years to move fully to the dev side and eventually advanced through the ranks to my current role as CTO of a pure software saas company.  IMHO my hardware background has actually given me some advantages when I've been at companies with hardware products because I have some understanding of both hw and sw.",

    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm an incoming transfer for CS and had some questions regarding the classes here. I will obviously be meeting with a counselor to discuss this but would like to plan early.\n\n1) How do the lab classes work for CS? When I'm reading the course catalogs, they say 3 lectures and 1 lab. Does this mean that it's 3 days of lecture per week (MWF), and then only one of those days (say maybe W) is a lab, or are all days also lab days?\n\n2) Also, what are these lab classes like? Are we just trying to apply what we learned in our lecture class in these labs, or are we doing something totally different?\n\n3) What classes would you guys consider to be the harder classes here? I've read that CSC 357 is a difficult one. Are any others as difficult or time-consuming as this?\n\n4) What class do you guys recommend to take for the Graduation Writing Requirement?\n\n5) When I was looking at the CSC transfer flowchart, it recommended that I took my concentration (AI) courses mostly during my 2nd year. I was wondering if you guys would recommend taking those courses early because I would like to take CSC 480 AI during my Winter semester, then CSC 487 Deep Learning during the Spring.\n\n6) What classes do you guys recommend to take very early on? For instance, I would like to start my concentration courses early, so I would need to take maybe CSC 300 or CSC 321/323/325 during my 2nd year instead of the 1st year.\n\n7) While on this topic, should I try and finish all the non-CSC/CPE courses during my first year like ES 351 or extra GEs if I have any left, or can I save them for my 2nd year? Is the second option a wise thing to do?\n\n8) Are Any recommended minors or if I should even attempt a minor?\n\nSorry if this seems like a bunch of questions, but thanks for answering them!",

            "comment": "\"1 lab\" is defined as 3 hours of lab time per week.   For CSC courses, usually a lab period follows the lecture. Most of CSC courses are 6 contact hours week: 3 hours of lecture, 3 hours of lab. MWF - 1 hour lecture + 1 hour lab per day, Tuesday -Thursday classes - 1.5 hours of lecture + 1.5 hours lab. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLab periods are used in somewhat different ways by the instructors, but you should expect some sort of software development assignment that you can work on during the lab periods - either by yourself or in a small team.  These assignments can range from \"complete by the end of the lab period\" to something that can be worked on throughout the entire quarter and submitted at the end of the quarter. This depends on the course and the instructor.  Other uses of lab time also occur on occasion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn other questions - you may want to balance your CS and non-CS coursework throughout your time at Cal Poly.  The most important things to jump on right away are any required courses which anchor prerequisite chains: CSC 357, CSC 349 are chief among them.  I \\*\\*would\\*\\* recommend starting AI/ML concentration coursework early. E.g. DATA 301 has rather low prerequisites and can be taken any quarter; it is also a useful course to take earlier rather than later in the study.",

            "comment": "1. MWF - 1 hour lecture, followed by 1 hour lab. TR - 1.5 hour lecture, followed by 1.5 hour lab. \n2. application of lecture material. 95% of the time, directly correlates with lecture material, in some cases, may be a slight bit behind in lab than in lecture.\n3. CSC357 (Systems Programming) is difficult because its the first time largely using C and doing systems level programming for many computing majors. CSC453 (Operating Systems) and CPE464 (Computer Networks) are also difficult, time consuming classes that have lots of new material. All these classes move quickly, and its advised to take no more than 1 of them in a quarter (take with other technical electives (300 and 400 level CS classes) or GEs, etc. \n4. there are many english courses offered; check the professor's ratings and go for any of them. \n5. taking 480 ASAP is good because its an easy introduction to AI, and DL builds on it slightly. \n6. anything you can get into, honestly.\n7. i'd go with the latter, it can be difficult to manage a schedule of 3-4 CSC classes, that all have labs and assignments associated with them. \n8. might not be the right idea for a CS major, but if you're very interested in something specific, talk to a career advisor and figure that out as you get into winter of your first year (give yourself fall to adjust to quarters).",

            "comment": "I\u2019m an incoming transfer as well. Can\u2019t really speak on any of the other points but my cc runs off the quarter system and generally how labs work is if there are 3 lecture 1 lab, you have 3 days of lecture during the week and then a completely separate day for lab. Labs can be both on the same day as a lecture or not, depends on the course. Of course this is under the assumption that quarter system at cc is the same at cal poly.",

            "comment": "I just transferred for cs this past year. 1 - From the classes that I have taken, there's usually lecture for an hour or so and then right after you have lab for an hour or so either in the same room or not, if online it says there 3 lectures and 1 lab that means all three lectures have the same lab time which will probably be like 3 times a week. 2 - usually just help, the classes I've taken, they aren't mandatory, more like office hours, maybe with a TA or for you to get homework checked off. 3 - 357 is tough, so is 315, and 349 that's as far as I've gotten. 4 - I think there's a health class that qualifies and it's pretty easy. 5 - idk ask an advisor . 6 - same as 5. 7 - I ran out of GEs so now I'm going to be taking nothing but cs classes which kinda sucks, so saving some could be a good idea. 8 - idk.",

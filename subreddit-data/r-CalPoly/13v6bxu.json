Tbh you'll be fine even working at the local chain store because it'll give you interviewing, people, and team skills you can use to get other jobs.",

And I'm sure if a business got to choose between a freshman or a junior/senior candidate, they'll choose the latter every time. \n\nLuckily, you got a lot of time to find one. Good luck in your search, and don't trip if you can't find one! You'll probably fare better next year. :)",

My backup plan is taking CC classes. I\u2019m worried though because if I miss out on something this summer it\u2019s just going to make it more difficult to land one next summer (when it really matters) because my resume won\u2019t be as good so it\u2019s sort of a domino effect.",

            "comment": "Most companies would rather hire students with more experience. Cal Poly is somewhat unique in that first years take some major classes. At some schools, you basically only take GE's your first year, and you're not really prepared at all for most internships. There's also the maturity factor. While some first years are very responsible and mature, others are basically still high school students, and they need another year or two of brain development before a company (and their HR department) wants to have anything to do with them. \n\nYour best bet for the summer after your first year is to find a job. Doesn't have to be related to your major, but a bonus if you can connect it in some way. Get work experience and references for the future from this job. You can also volunteer, take classes, or just relax. Not much is expected of the summer after freshman year. You should definitely be trying for internships starting next summer though.",

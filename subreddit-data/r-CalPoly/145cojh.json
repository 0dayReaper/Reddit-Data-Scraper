Uhh, know how file system works and how it\u2019s structured, know generally how the kernel works (rings etc). Should be ok. Know C very well. Pointers especially",

Unfortunately you will forget everything you learn for that test after 2 weeks. It is purely a waste of time, was very difficult, tests little practical knowledge in my opinion. Good luck though, I think he curves",

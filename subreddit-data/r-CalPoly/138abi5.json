I know most colleges required to pay a fee to accept but no such thing popped up when I accepted. My initial thought was that I had to only pay for SLO days and WOW until fall. Please help I am so confused with this process and when to pay.",

If you didn\u2019t see that and you\u2019ll be receiving a good amount of financial aid, they may have delayed the fee for you. Financial aid disperses in September so they will delay it for some people to pay after they get aid! If you don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case for you, call housing administration (building 31 - just search cal poly university housing contact) and ask them :) You can also check the money matters tab in your Cal Poly portal, because that\u2019s where all charges and anything due will appear.",

It's not a place to drop your bike off and have it fixed though. They do sell bikes as well.\n\n[Wally's Bicycle Works](https://www.wallysbikes.com/) is a good local bike shop on the South edge of town. \n\n[REI](https://www.rei.com/) has a service shop but isn't a local bike shop. It's just a chain that provides stuff.",

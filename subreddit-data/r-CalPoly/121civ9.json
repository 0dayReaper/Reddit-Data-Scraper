    "postText": "so I got accepted into both SDSU and Cal Poly, psych at SDSU and child dev at CP, and I've been doing a bunch of research to decide which one is a bit better for both my major and other research/internship opportunities. I've heard business-based majors are better at SDSU and STEM ones are better at CP but I'm most likely planning to do pre-med courses and go down that direction. any insight on which school might be better at preparing students for that? (also if someone could elaborate more on the child dev major at CP and if it's very different from the regular psych major I would be very grateful :))",

            "comment": "Cal Poly is great in general for research opportunities. Class sizes are small and you really get to know the professors. I was able to get a summer research internship after my second year. \n\nI switched out of CD into psychology because I wanted more psych classes instead of classes learning how to work with kids. It wasn\u2019t hard for me to switch into psych at all and there\u2019s a lot of overlap with the classes at the beginning. \n\nIt may be hard to fit in pre med classes with CD at cal poly because there\u2019s no overlap but it\u2019s definitely doable. There\u2019s plenty of free electives for both CD and psych. \n\nDm me if you have any questions!",

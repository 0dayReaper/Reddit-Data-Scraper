    "postText": "I am taking CSC 357 with Professor Eckhardt and CSC 315 with Professor John Seng. Initially I was planning on taking Stats 312(Professor Frank Giron) and MATH 214(Professor Retsek) with 315 and 357  but now I think it will be too much. Should I take 12 units with 2 CS classes or is 16 units manageable?",

            "comment": "Did you mean Math 241 aka Calc 4? That was the easiest of the calc series imo. Seng is also a fantastic professor and he does a ton to make the class workload and concepts accessible\n\nFor 357, the real question is how familiar are you with C, Unix, and concepts like pointers? If you have prior experience then you could look pull it off, but taking just 12 units would be a safer bet. They've made 357 less horrific over the years, but it is still a lot conceptually to get down in just a quarter",

Honestly it wasn't harder much than any other CS class and probably equivalent to 315 in terms of time spent working on projects/studying. Not sure if this is still the case.  \n\n\nIt was generally Mammen that made 357 hell.",

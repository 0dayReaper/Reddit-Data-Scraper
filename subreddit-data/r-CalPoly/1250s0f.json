    "postText": "Hi,\n\nAccepted as a nutrition major. I was going to do the Nutrition science emphasis which can give me the pre-med requirements.\n\nA few thoughts. How hard are the Chem/Bio/OChem classes? As we all know a good GPA is required to get into med school.  \n\n\nAs a backup Plan B I'd like to be a RD, but it seems that's no longer an easy option. If one changes to the Applied Nutrition emphasis is being a RD guaranteed out of school or is more studying/internships required?",

I just finished bio 161 and the teacher actually gave us an extra 2 points on each midterm and a couple extra points on the final to make the average a 70. not every bio 161 teacher does this though. \n\nit wasn't that the content was \"hard\" per say (disclaimer, I took ap bio so a lot of the content was review), it was that the test questions want you to *apply* your knowledge instead of just regurgitating facts. thankfully i took bio 150, which has similar question style, but a lot of people take bio 161 as their first bio class at cal poly and it leads to a lot of struggling.",

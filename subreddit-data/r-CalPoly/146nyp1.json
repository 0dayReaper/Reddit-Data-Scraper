(i lost my wallet and someone returned it to me last quarter which i\u2019m grateful for\ud83e\udee3)\n\nThe location I lost it at is Kennedy Library 24 hour room, the 10th, 11pm-1am. I checked the morning after and it wasn\u2019t there \ud83d\ude29\n\nIf anyone finds it please let me know! (or return to any housing front desk) It should have a paper with the room number and PCV building inside the lanyard",

People don\u2019t think of it but The Facilities  office is the main place where lost and found stuff ends up. Good luck! Hope you find it!",

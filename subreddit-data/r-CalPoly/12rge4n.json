Getting into business was super competitive this year, so it\u2019s certainly not a guarantee that you\u2019d be able to switch, even if your grades are good. Here\u2019s the process they follow, which you can\u2019t start until the end of your first quarter. https://www.cob.calpoly.edu/studentservices/changing-major/economics-or-business-administration-change-of-major-process/",

Having a strong gpa in your first quarter is critical.",

Honestly one of my favorite classes, especially because of how honest about their craft the professors are, especially Jeremy. Definitely crash it if you can, but please note if you\u2019re looking into taking it, please be engaged and interested. It\u2019s really frustrating to see people just lazily standing around or not showing up to labs because they\u2019re just doing it for a grade or because their WoW leader mentioned it. It\u2019s really fun and you\u2019ll be getting messy often.  \nOne last thing, if you take it, start thinking about what you\u2019re going to do for your final project (make something physical related to bees, or plan a beekeeping business) as early as possible. It\u2019s a chance to do something really cool (I made mead, a friend made leather conditioner with beeswax, someone else tried to make cough drops) even including potentially starting your own hives. There\u2019s a lot of cool projects that are conceivable including ones I/others hadn\u2019t thought of, and otherwise you become one of a dozen people who made chap sticks.",

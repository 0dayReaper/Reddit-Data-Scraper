    "postText": "I\u2019m currently trying to switch majors to Stats and the head of the department recommended that I take a class that can substitute for Calc 2 over the summer to catch up with the flow chart. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m coming across an issue. Ive applied to a lot of CCs lately but with all of them I can\u2019t get a pre-req clearance because Im still taking Calculus 1 and they don\u2019t accept in-progress courses yet. \n\nSince cal poly doesn\u2019t release grades later than most schools registrations times is there any way I can bypass this? or get some sort of waiver from cal poly to override this? \n\nor is there any other solution I could do?",

Many CCs will accept this. They aren\u2019t giving you credit for anything - just an opportunity to take a class.\n\nMany CCs are on the semester calendar and therefore their Calc 2 may articulate to Cal Poly as Calc 3 (leaving Calc 2 incomplete in degree planner). There are ways to handle this but I recommend you check it out with your adviser or Mustang Success Center for the best answer.",

Just check on assist.org as well to make sure classes articulate over to Cal Poly. As mentioned already email admissions or ask counseling at the CC about \u201cbypassing\u201d the pre-req. Almost every CC has a form of some sorts for this.",

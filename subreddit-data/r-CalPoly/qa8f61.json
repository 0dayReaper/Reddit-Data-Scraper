A red tail hawk can't keep up that pace. They aren't designed for sustained pursuit like that. Putting a hawk into that kind of situation is obviously problematic and dangerous. It puts a lot of pressure on the handler and animal that shouldn't be. Jesus get live traps if you're concerned about animal welfare. Fuck a few resident cats would be far more effective. If only for the fact they would scare off a decent portion of rodents vs actually killing them.",

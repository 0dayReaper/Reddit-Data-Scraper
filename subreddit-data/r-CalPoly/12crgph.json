    "postText": "Hi! I have Martin Mehl for Coms 101, and his ratings are pretty terrible. That, plus I'm also taking 3 other classes with a considerable amount of work makes me think I should drop it. Does anyone know if it's a good option to take async coms at cal poly over the summer, or at a cc? Or should I stick it through? Thanks!",

This manly pertains to the GE classes that you get to choose. Thanks!",

            "comment": "honestly this depends on what you want out of your GEs and the professors you get, not necessarily the class itself. \n\nMy one recommendation is to take COMS 145 instead of ENG145 for A3. there are way more professors for eng145 and some are very rough on grading. \n\nWhen you get access to degree planner, make sure you put that in for your winter and spring so you\u2019re blocked into it (after fall, you\u2019re only blocked into any remaining A GEs and major / support classes)",

I would personally recommend you take it this summer though, and transfer credits from cc. Saves money and puts you ahead. One asynch class will be super easy to manage in addition to whatever else you do. Check [assist.org](https://assist.org) for transferrable courses.",

The quizzes were kinda difficult to follow, but our midterm and final were essays he graded very leniently. He's also just an awesome dude, super accommodating and an overall amazing teacher who knows so much",

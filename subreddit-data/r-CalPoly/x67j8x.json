Wet your shirt and wrong out the excess and the evaporation will keep it really cool. Find cooler cities to spend the day (Pismo, Morro Bay). Go to a mid-day matinee movie for a few bucks and sleep in the air-conditioned darkness.",

Mine works pretty well for what I\u2019m using it for but it\u2019s also small and likely contributes little to increasing the humidity. I\u2019m guessing a large one would have a larger impact. Anyways good luck on finding a cooling solution!!",

Get some box fans and maybe an out/in window can (not sure what to call them). The night air is the best natural coolant without AC.

But, some of the EE folks I hung and lived with did play basketball.  One of the things that stuck in my head were the conversations during dinner about Flores's explanations about his bruises.    Also, hate to say this but a few people on campus thought she had intentionally gone missing without telling anyone - since she disappeared right around the time when we had a break from school.",

It seems that Ruben Flores (Paul's dad) bought his home pretty much around the time Kristen went missing.  This is the same house where they are digging.   Also, I heard that one of the witnesses was a coworker of Ruben's wife - and she says that Ruben's wife had told her that, one night Ruben received a call late at night and then left the house.  Ruben's wife didn't know what it was about - which is probably why she had mentioned that to her coworker.   So, by the sound of it - it seems plausible that Paul's dad came to help conceal the body that very night.",

    "postText": "TLDR:  My son lives on campus &amp; needs to borrow some needle nose pliers or something similar \n\nHi. I got a problem with my sons car horn. I just got the CarPlay &amp; Cruz control repaired Mothers Day Sunday. Since then the car horn is being very sensitive &amp; I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to get stuck on &amp; bug people or make my battery go dead. I just need to borrow someone\u2019s needle nose pliers or something similar so my son can pull the horn fuse out. My husband said the fuse is too short to pull out with finger alone. So it there\u2019s any helpful people out there please contact us. Thanks in advance everybody.",

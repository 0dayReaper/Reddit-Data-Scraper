She was really knowledgeable, I\u2019ll give her that, but it totally went to her head. Acting like she was the vp of Cal poly &amp; she lived &amp; breathed for that page. Meanwhile, HER KIDS WERENT EVEN AT CAL POLY ANYMORE LOL. \n\nThings started to heat up when she was banning people for talking about controversial topics and censoring what could be talked about. I remember people would ask about incidents of racism at the school (like *Im concerned about sending my child who is a poc to Cal Poly, what\u2019s it like for other poc*) and she wouldn\u2019t allow those conversations to happen. That led to students trying to get the page taken down, new pages being created, lots of trolls, and sooooooooo many memes. My roommates &amp; I would die laughing at the students pretending to be cal poly mustang parents Facebook page because some of those parents are UNHINGED. \n\nShe even got onto this subreddit when things were getting spicy on Facebook &amp; people lit her up each time. What a time.",

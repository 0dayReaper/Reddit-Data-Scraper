The career services center had to put a rule in place for companies that attend the career fair that states they have to give us 14 days to accept an internship because companies used to put us on the spot to accept jobs and internships without letting us consider it. I grew up talking with a lot of engineers from computer to biomedical and everything between. They all said Cal Poly SLO is the best school in the state. They also said Georgia Tech is probably the best engineering school in the nation, so do with that what you want. They said new hires and interns from Cal Poly run circles around Berkeley and UCLA students. Its probably because our education is hands on and we are actually taught by professors and not TAs.",

When CalPoly comes up, even on the east coast, the brand name impresses those who know it, who tend to be the movers and shakers.  Brand matters, at least as a pedigree.  Just like corporate leadership tends to be stuffed with folks from Top 20 schools and MBA programs.  You might be a genius, but it helps to get you to the front of the line if you have been verified as being selected for a top brand school.",

What I\u2019m questioning is the supposed justification of not sending rejection notices until 3/31 because the school is waiting to see how many people decline, when they won\u2019t know until 5/1, as most people don\u2019t send in declines early. The school has no idea what their yield will be during March while they\u2019re supposedly holding all these applications instead of just telling people they didn\u2019t get in. That\u2019s what a waitlist is for, not holding all the rejections until the end of March, so people have a hard time making a decision. It\u2019s just rude.",

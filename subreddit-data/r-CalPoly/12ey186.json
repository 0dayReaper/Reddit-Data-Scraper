For example, because of (insert why my dad wasn't able to complete his taxes), I believe it would be beneficial for me to take a quarter off. Due to the nature of our financial circumstances, a few extra months would be extremely helpful in getting our finances in order. I believe this will aid in my ability to thrive in college and utilize all of Cal Poly's resources. \nThen just ask them, what fucking documents do I need to go about doing this",

Going back and forth could also isolate you from a lot of peers as people may/may not want to join you or spend money. If you\u2019ve got a really good reason than it might be worth it, but in general I\u2019d probably do once every three weeks",

            "comment": "I've gone home (4 hour drive north past the bay) just about every other weekend and some multiple weekends in a row since January for work and other family functions. It's rough to say the least. As for the working part, I don't have that time to realistically do homework or study and I often work night shifts so that takes my days away too for sleep. With no class on Fridays, I usually leave Thursday night and come back Sunday night. Unless you plan on spending your weekends in either city doing assignments (esp ones that are due Sunday at midnight) and studying, you won't have much other time to get things done unless you are super on top of your shit and do things during the week.\n\nFor some context, I'm a senior bio major and am taking 3 400 levels and 1 200 (MCRO) that have 4 labs total throughout the week. I can't say that its affected my grades terribly but having to go home that often has definitely messed with my sleep schedule and miss out of opportunities with friends. And I probably could have done better on a few exams had I not spent the previous week trying to catch up from being gone over the weekend. So even if you want to go on weeks you don't have exams, it will affect your studying time and realistically a quarter schedule means you have fewer weeks without them. I had a friend this quarter who had a midterm just about every week.\n\nAnd for the driving, eight hours every weekend is fucking exhausting to say the least. By the time you get back to SLO, you won't want to do anything school related. And say goodbye to the 3 hour drive from SF on a Sunday because traffic is insane from Gilroy to other side of Salinas and it'll turn into a 5 hr drive unless you leave at like 6/7pm.\n\nIf you want to be active on the weekends tho, there are some great places closer to SLO that you should do weekend trips to, like the Carrizo Plains, Solvang, SB, Pinnacles NP, Yosemite/Sequoia/Kings Canyon. And if you don't like nature, then Santa Barbara is a nice bigger ish town to visit to get out of SLO when needed.",

I would drive 4 hours north to where I am originally from to visit family and my partner, or I would drive to Fullerton and San Diego to visit friends. I am a Phil major with a WGQS minor and was taking 4 classes on campus and 2 online at a cc. Work load and classes were crazy but that was reserved for Tues-Thursday. I would highly recommend only taking classes between Tuesday and Thursday, starting maybe around noon so you could even drive back to SLO morning of Tuesday. I did this for 11 weeks straight. Very doable if you schedule your classes correctly and are able to manage your schoolwork while in SLO. \nMore specifically to you, and your major, I have no idea how this would work for you. I don\u2019t know how rigorous the CS schedule is, but I\u2019d try to pick up as many online type of classes and fit in person classes in to the fewest amount of days of the week. Good luck to you!",

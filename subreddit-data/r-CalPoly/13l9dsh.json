The last time all of this is talked about, one of the things that became very apparent is that there\u2019s actually surprisingly little research about calendar systems for universities, certainly anything that would rise to the typical rigor of university research. A lot of the purported reasons or benefits mostly seem to be from anecdotal sources, so it\u2019s really difficult to find good information that is actually backed by before and after data and not just a well presented reason that sounds reasonable but lacks any actual data to back it. But I don\u2019t find this dearth of data surprising. After all, what administration wants to collect a detailed set of metrics only to find that they were wrong about something they spent millions of dollars and political capital to do? \n\nAlso, I really doubt that Cal Poly is going to be significantly less stressful unless part of this process is about reducing the academic rigor of or general character of education at Cal Poly. For example, I\u2019ve heard UCB is a pretty high stressful environment even though they are on semesters. And even though they are very different campuses, Stanford also sounds pretty damn stressful and they are on quarters. They are probably stressful in different ways, but I don\u2019t think that calendar really makes a huge difference in comparison to the caliber of institution you are talking about. \n\nI could totally be wrong, but ultimately, there really isn\u2019t much data that demonstrates a clear causal mechanism or significant results among comparable peer institutions (even better if there is actual research design involved to control for various other factors relating to social climate, atmosphere, etc.) If you are teaching the same content just divided up and packaged differently, it really shouldn\u2019t make a huge different how stressful it is. In theory you have more time to learn the material for the final exam and grade, but how many students actually take advantage of that time in practice? There are certainly plenty more factors that you could make compelling arguments for and against, some of which may intersect with calendar, but the main problem is that I don\u2019t think calendar changes are often worth the hassle they create and the disruption they cause to the institutional momentum in terms of understanding how to offer the best experience possible.",

Both systems have their strengths and weaknesses. \n\nFor sure.\n\n&gt; Since a quarter system is shorter, and tests are more frequent, I would argue you need to maintain consistent knowledge of the coursework(aka you can\u2019t slack off). \n\nIt really all depends on how the class that you\u2019re in is run. This is part of the problem with my midterm season never seems to end, because all professors run their classes differently. I had professors that basically had a quiz every week or every other week, and I\u2019ve had some who placed the \u201cmidterm\u201c basically a couple weeks before the final, such that you don\u2019t have to prepare twice, but that if you are behind, you do have at least a chance to catch up.\n\nI also do think that there\u2019s kind of an interesting emphasis on student success when I actually do think that what are the really important things that many Cal poly students learn is some amount of resilience. Maybe you didn\u2019t do quite as well as you wanted in that one class or you completely failed and have to take something again. that\u2019s OK. I know that there\u2019s always an adjustment. For a lot of students coming to college, but I remember after my first quarter I was may be a bit disappointed with my performance in summer courses. But I did eventually get over it. In fact, I think students being able to get knocked down and then be able to get back up again is actually something that is a really important life lesson. So I understand the incentives around trying to get everyone to pass everything and be successful the first time. However, life is definitely not like that, and I think most students make it through okay.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll totally admit that this is an anecdote and it\u2019s not going to be the case for everyone and there are legitimately issues that people face surrounding the pace of the quarter system, but I think the idea that it\u2019s some big catastrophic issue or that we are going to significantly gain anything of substance by transitioning is pretty ridiculous. \n\n&gt; The semester system on the other hand provides more \u201cleeway\u201d since there are larger periods between tests, however this could also be a disadvantage since you need to cover more content/review more for each test. \n\nOne of the other things, though too is that you have to take more courses concurrently. The amount of time you spend on any one particular thing is less than in a quarter system, because it\u2019s stretched out over a longer term, but naturally that means you need to take more classes at the same time. Basically, take about 8-units and add those classes onto your schedule for another quarter. And what really sucks about this is that this actually can lead to difficulties in scheduling and when capacity is as resource constrained in terms of classroom space and instructors as it is, this can become a problem. \n\nI really should post the original quarter to semester task force report that came out about a decade ago now, but one of the things that they found was that scheduling labs was probably going to be a really difficult thing. And this would either mean that these courses need to be dropped/reduced, taught in extra sessions (like summer), or offered on the weekends. Also, think a lot of the kinesiology classes are gonna have issues, at least the small fun ones that people like to take as an extra thing, because instead of doing 10 weeks of a one unit class, one unit is now 15 weeks, but basically, you lose an entire quarters worth of people who might want to take something like bowling. I suppose you could add more classes, but probably not that many.\n\n&gt; This means you can make-do with having gaps in your knowledge for a period of time but once you start studying, that gap is much wider for a semester student versus a quarter student.(if you\u2019re procrastinating its worse since theres more content).\n\nAgain, I really just think it depends on how professors actually run the courses. It\u2019s been my experience that most professors at Cal poly usually don\u2019t like to go more than three or four weeks without some kind of evaluation, whether that be some kind of quiz, midterm, or whatever they might like to call it. But I\u2019ve also had classes were effectively there\u2019s been nothing except for what is a final exam and maybe a project and some homework. It really just depends.\n\nBeyond this, I\u2019ll totally admit, I think part of my defensiveness of the quarter system is that so many other schools are all on the same calendar, and the reality is just that some people will do better on one versus the other. I personally do think we should be doing more to defend the idea of calendar diversity, because of the very least, it means that certain schools will have to think about their curriculum differently than everyone else. I know it\u2019s a very difficult position to hold to say that it doesn\u2019t matter and then argue that it matters, but I think part of the problem is that often times it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what something is worth until it\u2019s gone. And right now, quarter based academic calendars are kind of an endangered species. I do think the danger in having everyone on one calendar is that it\u2019s pretty easy to take the course work you learn at one place and just directly applied to another. And to me, that makes how much students are paying just feel even more of a rip off because basically you can take a cookie cutter course and teach it anywhere.\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve also noticed is that academics are often very opposed to any kind of curriculum reform or change, which is part of the reason why I think it\u2019s so important to have different calendars. Naturally, we do have to divide our content up a bit differently. Even if general Ed and lower div courses are \u201ctechnically\u201d the same because you might do a year of calculus or a year of chemistry or what not, when you start getting in upper division electives, we basically have to Think differently about how we structured courses and how certain things that might be \u201cnice\u201c to teach in a 15 week course are not actually necessary sometimes. And to be fair, sometimes that means it will cut the other way too. But I think the reality of things is just that academics often times need to be shown how people are doing different things differently. It can force us to rethink what we are doing and is there a better ways to be doing it, in part because other people are showing that it\u2019s possible. \n\nI do think there are other reasons as well, but I would say this, along with Cal Poly\u2019s seeming desire to continue to keep trying to be essentially an Ivy League institution, instead of leaning more into what it actually is and has been in the past is a mistake. And of course it\u2019s not just our institution, but it really saddens me to see that\u2019s so many institutions are continuously, trying to be basically carbon copies of each other, just in different locations and with different histories. Education should be about challenging assumptions, and coming about things from different perspectives and points of view, so even if there are \u201cadministrative efficiencies\u201c (which, by the way, is definitely the biggest reason that some people are in favor of this, because it\u2019s probably the most tangible benefit) I think something is being lost, even if it\u2019s not entirely clear apparent what.",

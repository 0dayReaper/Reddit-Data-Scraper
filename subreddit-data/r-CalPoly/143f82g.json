    "postText": "First reddit post forgive me, m(24) There is a gas station about a mile away from my house. Since highschool ive been going there, i know the people who work there, they know me. Its a real small town vibe that i have with them. Keep in mind the staff is elderly, seems like a family owned franchise type thing to me, not entirely sure. Skip a few years. I come back from college and there is a new guy working there, also older just not as old as the other workers. Btw id guess the youngest of the original staff is probably mid 70\u2019s right now (just context). Lemme wrap it up, this new employee is a, family guy lvl corny quipper. Now i love family guy but not when im gettin gas, pack of smokes or any convenience item i might need to get last minute. I love the establishment and the family owning the place; they have always been kind to me. So i really dont want to be rude to him in front of them, or rude in general. But i need help figuring out what to say to politely make him shut the fuck up.\n\nTl;dr Guy with corny quips started working at my longtime local gas station. How do I politely (or even impolitely) tell him to stfu?",

But how do i politely ask someone to not make cringey jokes towards me. Also, its not \u201chis\u201d establishment. Its a damn Chevron. Im just wondering how i should politely ask him to not address me when i am in the store",

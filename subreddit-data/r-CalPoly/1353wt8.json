    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nAre you a frequent user of the rec center? We want to hear from you! We're a team of students from the CSC 484 (User-Centered Interface Design and Development) class, and we're conducting a survey to improve the user experience of ASI Access specifically regarding its uses at the rec center.  Your feedback will help us in the design and development of a new gym app for all Cal Poly students, staff, and alumni.\n\nYour participation in this survey is greatly appreciated.  We give our sincerest thanks in advance for taking the time to fill it out. It will only take a few minutes of your time, and your responses will remain anonymous.\n\nWe're also looking for students, staff, or alumni who are open to further communications to answer \"yes\" and provide their email address at the bottom of the survey. By doing so, you'll be helping us at the next level. Specifically, we will have a second survey after this one ends that drills further down into your personal experience with the app. This will help us a lot with tuning our new design.\n\nHere's the link to the survey: [https://forms.office.com/r/8e5mfpFBa7](https://forms.office.com/r/8e5mfpFBa7)\n\nThank you again for your help in improving the gym experience for everyone!\n\nBest regards,\n\nthe Polyfit team  \n\n\ntldr; Please fill out our survey if you use the rec center! We'd appreciate it a lot: [https://forms.office.com/r/8e5mfpFBa7](https://forms.office.com/r/8e5mfpFBa7)",

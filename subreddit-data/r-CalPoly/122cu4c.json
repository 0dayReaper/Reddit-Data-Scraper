            "comment": "If you want to work in data science, stats is most definitely better. Business/econ concentrations are not that deep, as they\u2019re only 6-7 classes. Stats is a very complex topic, made even more complex in applications in data science. Quant Analysis is a decent introductory sequence to get you to \u201cgood enough\u201d in terms of practical working knowledge if you want to be a business analyst, data analyst, other roles that are more lightly technical, etc. but don\u2019t expect to be a data scientist or other far more technical role with it.\n\nTL;DR: QA is a good idea to build a solid stats foundation as a business/econ guy, but it\u2019s not gonna turn you from a business/econ guy to a tech/math guy.",

Lacking it can be a handicap. \n\nAlso, if you feel like you still want to have some deeper finance/Econ knowledge, take some of the other classes on the side, there\u2019s no limit. It\u2019s always good to have a combination.",

It says a lot when most business majors think STAT 252, an introductory statistics course, is the hardest class in the major. The econ students are definitely better about this, but it\u2019s still a lacking skillset in most of OCOB. QA helps you stand out and I agree that an analytical skillset is getting more and more important every day.",

If you\u2019re not taking that concentration, there\u2019s not even that. \n\nI was in a conversation with an individual working in private equity, and he told me directly \u201cif a candidate lacks statistical or analytical skills, they won\u2019t be considered, period.\u201d I can only imagine that\u2019s a common belief in other competitive fields.",

I\u2019ve been saying ever since I began attending that business should have a mandatory business/data analytics class where everyone must become familiarized with R and learn a data viz tool like Tableau or PowerBI, and it should actually be a difficult class. That would go a long way to help.\n\nAnd yes, I completely agree. Cal Poly isn\u2019t a target for prestigious fields like IB, PE, consulting, etc. and that\u2019s because we\u2019re not a prestigious business school. But that itself comes from the fact that the courseload is not rigorous enough. Accounting is pretty much fine as our accounting programs are great and they\u2019re implementing more data-oriented stuff, but OCOB students should not be able to run to marketing, HR, and entrepreneurship to completely escape learning technical skills.\n\nIf CENG can be a heavy FAANG target, OCOB can be a business target too. But until we really up the standards, it won\u2019t happen.",

I\u2019m a microbio major and I agree that even bio majors need more technical and quantitative skills so much so that I double minored in stats and cs.

It\u2019s lowkey one of the best majors out there for cal poly yet it\u2019s not a very popular major. I think stats major at cal poly opens you up to many many great career paths including data science. You\u2019re not limited for applying to software engineering jobs either although it might be harder in this job market I\u2019ve seen it happen.",

QA will give you a baseline understanding, enough to work in data analytics, but if you\u2019re interested in the more intensive side of data science QA is not not going to prepare you unless you put in some serious work outside of class. In addition, the data science minor is so big that it\u2019s pretty much only achievable to complete in under four years if you\u2019re a stats or CS major due to the overlap in classes.",

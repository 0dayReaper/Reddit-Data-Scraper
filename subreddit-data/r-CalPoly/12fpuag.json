I'd love to participate but $50 per person and $175 for the small group experience seems a bit steep, especially since I plan on bringing a guest. \n\nAre these worth the price? If they are, is the small group WOW experience $100 better then the independent one?",

Sometimes they\u2019ll show you things like how to take the free bus to get to downtown or grocery stores, best restaurants to go to, you\u2019ll go on hikes, kayaking at Morro bay, bonfires at the beach. But only if they can get their friends to drive everyone out. If you have a large group or your leaders don\u2019t have cars and friends with cars you won\u2019t get to do any of that.",

Also, when I was a Wowie, my transfer group was about 50 students which wasn\u2019t bad. I think the odds of finding someone you actually want to be friends with are better in a larger group",

YOU WILL MAKE LIFELONG FRIENDS who will be there for you in a deeper way than many of your other friends who u will first meet in college because you'll already have a week of hanging out with all this same group of people.  \n\n\nI did WOW twice, one as a freshman and once as a transfer 10 years later. \n\nI skipped whatever WOW activities I could and didn't participate enthusiastically the first time around. I didn't know how good of a bond you can build with people in one week. \n\nThe second WOW round I participated in everything and acted as a semi co leader with how enthusiastic I was when I participated and the entire group saw me as this leader and confident person simply because I played in my head that I was confident and everyone responded super well. \n\nTLDR: GO TO WOW, you won't know what you missed out on if you don't go. Tell your parents this is a friendship building class that will give you a healthy foundation of friendship for your whole college career and the $300 it'll cost with all the activities you do will be impossible to be able to value later down the road. \n\nBeing able to interact and be real with people in the most important and most highly paid skill in all the world so $300 is nothing in the grand scheme of life \n\nRead that last sentence again and invest yourself in your friends",

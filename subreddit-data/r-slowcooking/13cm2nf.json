The internet has many recipes, but at its simplest, it's anywhere from 8 to 10 cups of liquid for each cup of rice, add salt to taste - it's basically a porridge with rice as the grain.",

Bottom layer is hashbrowns, then mix 8 eggs and a can of evaporated milk, ham, green onion and cheese together in a bowl and pour over top. It bakes on 350 for an hour in the oven, just convert to slow cooker time.",

Soak lentils overnight\n\n2. Drain off water, place in saucepan and cover with fresh water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 40 mins until the dal is soft.\u00a0\n\n3. Peel and finely chop onions, garlic, ginger.\u00a0\n\n4. Melt butter in a saucepan and add the chopped ingredients, soften on low heat for 10-15 mins until soft but not coloured.\u00a0\n\n5. Add the spices (cumin, paprika, coriander powder, garam masala, chilli powder) and cook for 2 mins\n\n6. Add the tomato puree and cook for a few more mins\n\n7. Add the canned tomatoes, breaking them down with a spoon\n\n8. Cook for 3-4 mins, season generously\n\n9. When dal is cooked, transfer to the slow cooker. Add the cooked spice paste/onions.\u00a0\n\n10. Pour in the milk, top with water to just cover the dal.\u00a0\n\n11. Stir and cook for at least 6-8 hours (I cooked this 8 hours on High) , stirring every now and then. If it looks too dry, top with more milk or water, alternating between the two. It should start to darken after a few more hours.\n\n12. Check the seasoning, add a knob of butter, stir. Serve with a swirl of double cream and coriander leaves.\u00a0",

You could adjust the times and see if it would work but keep a close eye and keep checking if you're happy with the consistency of the dish -  results not guaranteed!",

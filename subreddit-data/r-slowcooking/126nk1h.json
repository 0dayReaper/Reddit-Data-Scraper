    "postText": "I have a 6/7 quart (not entirely sure but it's big). 4 thawed chicken breasts, russet potatoes, and fresh broccoli and onions. I put the chicken in with some cream chicken soup and half a can of water on high around 7 am ish. Should I throw the cubed potatoes and the broccoli in now with more stock or water maybe? Or should I just go ahead and cook the potatoes separately this time? WFH with early 11am lunch and it occurs to me I've never really used my cooker except for soups or specifically following a recipe.\n\nHonestly since I'm not sure when this post will get answered (sorry my bad lol), I should probably fix veggies separately this time and take y'all's advice for next time.\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n\nSo I ended up just roasting enough veggies and cooking a breast for lunch and then throwing the rest of the uncooked veggies into the crockpot. They actually got done in about 2 1/2 hours on high. Actually almost too done. I was really surprised.\n\nThank y'all for the help! Lunch around here is a general time frame, so at least I have an idea, but since it is an \"ish\" time frame, I can't time food to be ready at exactly 11, or whatever, because it isn't always the same. Prep makes my life so much easier!",

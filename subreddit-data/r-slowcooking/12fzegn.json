    "postText": "I\u2019ve been slow cooking (on high) pulled pork for 4 hours in my instant pot and it\u2019s still tough\ud83d\ude1e I know an instant pot isn\u2019t as good as a traditional slow cooker. What should I do? Pressure cook? Continue to slow cook on high?\n\nUpdate: I ended up pressure cooking and it came out so tender! The seasoning became very diluted so I\u2019m reducing down the juices to make into a sauce. Thank you everyone!",

This hearty soup is inspired by traditional Lasagna, but with a delicious twist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis recipe makes: 6 portions\n\nPreparation time: 20 minutes\n\nCooking time: 3h\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for Lasagna Soup:**\n\n\\* 1.1 lb (500g) ground beef\n\n\\* 8 Lasagna sheets broken to pieces\n\n\\* 1 small carrot (3.5oz/100g), small dice\n\n\\* 1 medium onion (5.3oz/150g), small dice\n\n\\* 1.8oz (50g) of celery, small dice\n\n\\* 3 garlic cloves, sliced\n\n\\* 2 cups (500 ml) beef or vegetable stock\n\n\\* 1 cup (250 ml) of red wine\n\n\\* 14oz (400g) of can chopped tomatoes or passata\n\n\\* 1/2 tsp dried oregano (you can use some for garnish as well)\n\n\\* good pinch of ground cloves and cinnamon\n\n\\* 2tbsp of olive oil\n\n\\* salt and black pepper to personal taste\n\n\\* small amount of sugar to balance sourness of tomatoes\n\n\\* freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano for garnish\n\n\\* garlic bread to serve\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to prepare Lasagna Soup:**\n\n1. Start by heating 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan over high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the ground beef and let it brown on both sides without breaking it apart too soon.\n2. Once you've achieved the desired level of browning, break apart the meat and cook for a couple more minutes. Then transfer the beef to a slow cooker.\n3. Add the remaining olive oil to the frying pan, then add the mirepoix (diced onion, celery, and carrot). Cook on medium heat until it starts to brown slightly, then transfer to the slow cooker with the beef.\n4. To the slow cooker, add beef stock, red wine, chopped tomatoes, oregano, and spices. Mix everything together with a spoon, cover with a lid, and cook on high setting for 3 hours.\n5. After 2.5 hours, add broken lasagne sheets or any other pasta on hand to the soup.\n6. Once the Lasagna soup is ready, adjust the seasoning to your preference and add more water if the soup is too thick. Enjoy it with garlic bread and freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano. Buon appetito! \n\nOriginally posted here: [Lasagna Soup](https://www.insightflavour.com/post/lasagna-soup)",

If so, how does it chabge the outcome?\n\nSlowcooking for me is all about bunging everything in, turning it on, and forgetting about it until I get home in the evening.  I have a 24hr timer plug so it still only does X hours even when I'm out for X+N hours.\n\nWhen I slowcook, I cannot be arsed to do a bunch of cooking before putting it in the *cooker*.  Mainly because I'm doing it at 06:00 in a rush as I'm already late.\n\nSo, how does **not** browning stuff change the flavour/texture in dishes like this?",

                    "comment": "&gt;has anyone done this without the browning of the beef\n\nIn my experience it makes the meat taste much more bland and kind of sweeter. In addition to looking grossly gray. Also as others have pointed out, you then keep all of the fat and it doesn't get into/used correctly for the other parts. So it makes things greasier, and less crisp even if the recipe doesn't drain the fat.\n\nIt's not the end of the world, I would just cook the veggies less since they aren't protected by the fat, and I would spoon off the fat that separates out at the end. \n\nTimewise: I defrost things two days before, then put the meat into my fancy Crock-Pot express on high to brown while I cut veggies (out of their freezer bags lol) and get spices lined up. Then drain if needed, push the meat to the side, add veggies get them transparent in like a minute, and then add everything else and turn down. If I have everything already it only takes like 20 minutes, and honestly I'm less concerned about the veggies so I'm putting the rest in at that point.\n\nYou might be able to do the same with a slow on high and a bit more time with the beef in there to start.",

I had a conversation with someone about this in Japan the other week and they were amazed (Irish person here) do we fuck eat seasoned corned beef on St Patricks day. We eat Stew! \n\nHow to make Stew:\n\n500g mince beef\n750g white potatoes\n4-6 carrots\n2 large onions\n2 beef stock cubes\nBit of rosemary, thyme and black pepper. \n\nItems required:\n\nA large pot\nWater\n\nProcess:\n- 1/2 fill the pot with water. Add your mince, bring to a boil. \n-Once mince is browned skim the water and remove as much fat as possible (believe me you don't want greasey stew).\n- Peel and chunk up your vegetables, \n1/8 your potatoes depending on size.\nCarrots into bite size chunks.\nOnions slice the top and bottom off and cut top down into 1/8ths.\nNote: (smaller chunks mean better stew, but too small means you get sludge).\n-Put all the veggies in the pot with your mince, stir it and break up the mince. \n-Add in your beef stock cubes, herbs and black pepper, be generous here as your pot should be massive. \n- Top up the water if necessary. Should be just below the top of the ingredients. \n-Bring it to a rolling boil. \n-Once bubbling ferociously, bring it down to a simmer. \n-Leave it alone for a minimum of two hours. At least four of you want decent stew. \n\nHow you know it's done, is the potatoes crumble when you stick a fork in them and the water will be opaque. \n\nIf the flavours not strong enough for you add in some HP brown sauce or Worcestershire Sauce. \n\nThat's what we eat on St Patricks day. There are variations (some people add in gravey granules, but that's how I make stew. \n\nWill keep on the stove with the lid on, and you should definitely have a helping the next day as stew tastes better the next day. \n\nYou can get about 3-4 meals for two people out of this (depending on pot size) and it's able to be frozen.",

The large white fat line that won't really dissolve isn't nearly as huge as it is in [this chuck roast](http://edengourmet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/chuck-roast.jpg), which also has much worse marbling.

If you're buying beef you want to pay attention to [the grade](http://portal.farmcentric.com//cdfm/Beeive53/author/995/grades.jpg) - I think that most cheap meat at grocery stores is select. I actually work as a meat cutter at Sam's Club, so I just buy all my meat from there because it's the easiest and I get to handpick good pieces for myself. Everything sold there is choice, but [there's still variety](http://meatscience.org/TheMeatWeEat/images/default-source/The-Meat-We-Eat/choice-pictures.jpg?sfvrsn=0) within that grade.\n\nYou also want to pay attention to gristly things like tendons or connective tissue that doesn't break down while cooking.  [Here's an example](https://d3awvtnmmsvyot.cloudfront.net/api/file/zufXEjLITaBISbTmfnQF/convert?fit=max&amp;w=1150&amp;quality=60&amp;cache=true&amp;rotate=exif&amp;compress=true) of strip steaks. All of the bottom steaks contain chewy connective tissue that breaks up the meat. The steaks on the top have completely uniform muscle portions, so they will be much tastier. Even though the steak on the bottom left would be rated prime, it would be worse than the barely marbled steak on the top right.\n\nAnd finally when you cook any kind of meat you want to cut [against the grain of the muscle fibers](https://i2.wp.com/www.thekitchenwhisperer.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/against-the-grain1.jpg), which is really easy to see in that flank example. [What the cut should look like](https://img.wonderhowto.com/img/08/95/63533329364323/0/essential-secrets-for-perfectly-slicing-meat.w1456.jpg). This doesn't really apply to slow cooking to the point of being able to shred the meat.",

Went to check on the crock pot when it was supposed to be done and someone in the household \"accidentally\" turned it off.  The crock pot was cold but I checked internal and external food temps and it's still in the green for food safety.  Downside is it's not going to get done by dinner time.  I think it's got a couple hours of cook time left.  Sigh.... \n\nEdit 2: The premature shutdown of the crock pot seemed to have a major impact on the outcome.  I fired it back up for a couple of hours but the final product was inconsistent.  Some parts were good and others tough and dry.  No one has admitted to the act but since it was news years eve alcohol may have been a factor.   Overall it was an OK meal but not my best cook.  Vegetables were a big hit but I give my try at the Mississippi Pot roast a C+.  No pics for this one. ",

The potatoes i just cut in half and then in quarters- just try to keep them all in the same size range.  No liquid is added- the juice from the roast and the butter are plenty.  I cook it on low- i leave the house around 7am, and then have my husband or son turn it to \"keep warm\" when they get home from work/school. I usually put a loaf of frozen bread dough out to thaw and bake it when i get home- house smells amazing AND dinner is done!  One word of advice- Reynolds makes crockpot liners- they are the best invention since sliced bread.  There is basically no clean up- just pull out and toss!

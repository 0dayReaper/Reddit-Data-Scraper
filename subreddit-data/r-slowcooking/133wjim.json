I was thinking a 4 quart? And what is a good quality brand?  I\u2019d like one that had some automatic features to make it easy for him to not have to worry too much about it.",

I did have a 2qt that I used which was nice but limiting. \n\nI use the crockpot brand. The 4qt I have is digital with a timer and warmer which I love. \n\nI have an instant pot that's basically a glorified rice cooker. I know some folks love theirs, but the slow cook function doesn't get hot enough so some dishes don't work in it.",

            "comment": "Lots have commented Instant Pot so I went and Googled it to see what they mean. My first thought was that they're quite expensive, even the cheapest one. I'd stick to your original plan of a Slow Cooker.\n\nI don't think brand is too important as I've had many and haven't noticed any particular differences. As far as size goes I'd suggest quite a small one for a few reasons. 1 - I've dropped and cracked a few slipperies and I think size was a factor. 2 - The volume can affect cooking, especially if you're only cooking for yourself but there's heaps of empty space left which allows the ceramic to overheat. 3 - It's a lot less intimidating with a smaller pot and meals become more viable.\n\nI'm honestly happy with my 1.5 litre. I wouldn't replace it with anything bigger than 2 litres. I've previously had 4 and 6 litre Slow Cookers but since I was only cooking for myself they were never practical. The small ones can heat up faster with the less volume also lid lifting isn't as much of a setback.",

It's a kitchen gadget that can do lots of things like cooking food quickly, making stews, soups, roasts, desserts and more!\n\nInstant Pots are easy to use and come with pre-set cooking programs. You can even saut\u00e9 and brown ingredients in it too. It saves time and dirty dishes in the kitchen, plus it can make you a better cook! So, if you want a kitchen gadget that can do it all, go for an Instant Pot instead of a slow cooker.",

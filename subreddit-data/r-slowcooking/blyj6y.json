This recipe is extremely hearty and filling.    \n\n\nChicken:    \n(1) 7 oz jar Sun Dried Tomatoes, sliced (drained).    \n2 Tbsp Butter.    \n4 Chicken Breasts, boneless/skinless.    \n1 small Onion, diced.    \n1 1/2 tsp Italian Seasoning.    \n1/4 tsp Red Pepper Flakes.    \n(1) 15 oz jar Alfredo Sauce* [recipe for homemade sauce below] (with roasted garlic).    \n3/4 cup Parmesan Cheese (more for garnish).    \n2-3 cups Fresh Baby Spinach.    \n\n-Drain the sun dried tomatoes and set aside.    \n-Heat a skillet on med-high heat and add the butter. Add the chicken breasts and brown both sides. Remove chicken and place in the slow cooker.    \n-Add the onions to the skillet and cook until just turning translucent.    \n-Add the sun dried tomatoes to the onions and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off heat and add onion/sun dried tomato mixture to the slow cooker.    \n-Sprinkle in the Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.    \n-Pour the Alfredo sauce over the top and close the lid.

Let cook for a few more minutes, until spinach is wilted/softened.    \n-Serve over pasta or potatoes.    \n\nHomemade Alfredo Sauce (if you don't want store bought):    \n\u00bd cup butter.    \n1 pint heavy whipping cream 2 cups.    \n4 ounces cream cheese.    \n\u00bd teaspoon minced garlic.    \n1 teaspoon garlic powder.    \n1 teaspoon italian seasoning.    \n\u00bc teaspoon salt.    \n\u00bc teaspoon pepper.    \n1 cup grated parmesan cheese.    \n\nIn a medium saucepan add butter, heavy whipping cream, and cream cheese.

Seared in butter on a hot pan about a minute on each side. flip when you see a little red coming out the top of the meat some.  Salt,pepper and garlic, is delicious. Or seasoning of choice. I enjoy the taste of venuson and try not to cover it up too much, a little salt goes a long way with bringing out the flavor.\n\n I've made the back straps in larger chunks and seared all the outside too.  I personally prefer the smaller pieces, even if it is a little more work. They're like tender mini steaks that fall apart in your mouth. \n\nYou can also follow the same process except coat them in flour/seasoned flour before cooking. Throw them all in a bag and give it 30 seconds of shaking, should get a nice even light coat on all the pieces. Just my 2cents\n\nEdit: you'll probably find yourself eating pieces fresh out of the pan between batches, it's so good. As stated by others below, most important thing is not over cooking.",

The way around this is to either cook it in a recipe that has a lot of fat added to it during the cooking process or use sous vide to \u201ccheat\u201d. \n\nVenison steak stroganoff is a great way to use em up since the steaks are cut into strips and then fried in butter before simmering in a broth (picks up plenty of liquid and fat) but it\u2019s not a traditional steak. \n\nIf you want just a straight up steak, sous vide is your ace in the hole. It\u2019s absolutely idiot proof. Add a pat of butter and whatever flavoring you\u2019d like, let it cook for a few hours, then sear the bejesus out of it over a grill or in a frying pan to finish it off.

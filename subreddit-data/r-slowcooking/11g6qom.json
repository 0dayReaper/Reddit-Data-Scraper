But the ingredients in this stew was always in any various ways to make them. This is how my 4 generations in my family started their stew. It was also about the cheaper ingredients. Not having the money to add two variation of potatoes and extra veg. \nBut yes people can for sure add what they like.",

When he came to visit his coworkers in California, we took him to our local \"Irish Pub,\" and we asked him what he thought of the menu. He briefly looked at it and said so definitively, 'Well you see here, you call it Irish Stew. Back home in Ireland we just call it stew;\" and it's still maybe the hardest I've laughed in all my life.",

This is a traditional irish stew for anyone interested. The second image is the ingredients and process. \nYou may need to season to taste when done, but this is how we make it here in Ireland. A few Irish may have variations but this is your bog standard Irish stew. \n\nTip if you think you have too much potatoes in the stew you are wrong. I put 12 smal to med in mine and I'll probably add more tomorrow. \nAny questions let me know.\nHopefully I will be able to post the picture of the cooked stew later.\n\n\nEdit: two oxo cubes is what most stews would have if you don't have stock pots. I just like to use 1 stock pot.\n\nEdit again.,... 800g-1kg og beef. Sorry typo.  \n\nI will say this is the first time I took note of what I put it cos I do the recipe by eye and I was taught to make it by eye.\n\nIf you are Irish and have a variation reply to this comment, let people know it is a variation. \n\nBut I just want to be clear this recipe is your basic formula, cheap ingredients, 1 cooking process, all ingredients in pot and cook. There wasn't time or money to be adding fancy herbs, or cooking things separately. I'm thinking about the history behind it and what was passed down to me through my family generations.",

Yours looks much, much better than that, though. I grew up with my mom/grandma making this and it was more like 6-8 hours for theirs.",

I've only ever made it in the instant pot and it's pretty good. I'd recommend adding in more spices/herbs to your liking since the original recipe seems kinda bland. I always add in chili peppers for some heat. It's a great basic recipe tho since you can just substitute things to your preference, and the instant pot works perfectly well for it.",

It made 4 serves in our pasta bowls with none left over, more a stew than a soup with the extra pasta.  Felt it was a good amount of chorizo, definitely there but didnt overpower.  Didn't really notice carrot but my celery sticks were big and not cut anywhere near fine enough :)",

Perhaps this stew could be made with a pound of ground turkey, chicken, or pork instead, all quite cheap.",

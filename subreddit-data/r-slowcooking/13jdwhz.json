Also, you can eat it with bread, crackers, hot dogs, chips, or just straight from a bowl. With cheese or without, with sour cream or without, yada yada yada.\n\nThen again I think a good chili is the solution to a lot of life's problems.",

It's not a slowcooker recipe but it works just as well in one.\n\n* Brown the onions and sear the meat in the frypan. Then chuck everything into the slowcooker. \n* Cook on high for 5 hours then low for last 3 hours ( I think i have to use high because I fill the slowcooker way to high when i make this)\n* One hour before completion take the meat out. shred all the meat and discard the bones. Place meat back in the slowcooker. Add the noodle soup mix. Top up liquid with more boiling water. \n\n*If you want to make it cheaper I usually use lamb off-cuts that have the bone still in. \n\n*My supermarket doesn't seem to have Turnip so i just use a kumera (sweet potato) instead. \n\nhttps://www.bestrecipes.com.au/recipes/nannas-lamb-shank-vegetable-soup/h6a60evn",

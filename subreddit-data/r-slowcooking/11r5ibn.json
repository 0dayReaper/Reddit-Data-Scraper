I skipped the butter this time, too, and added some pepperoncini juice instead. It was nice and tangy and not overly fatty.\n\nAlso for the love of god do not use the full packet of ranch seasoning and au jus for less than like 3 lbs. of meat or it\u2019ll end up salty af. Yes, I just learned this the hard way. LMAO. I\u2019d recommend doing 1/2 a pack of each plus 1/2 cup water - this should help give it more gravy and reduce the salt.",

Maybe mixing them together in a baggie and using half, then saving the other half for another roast next time would be a better idea. And definitely no salted butter LOL, unsalted would probably be best.",

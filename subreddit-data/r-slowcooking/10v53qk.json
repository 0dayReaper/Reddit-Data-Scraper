Minor additions are permitted, such as a little chopped bacon, or chopped green onion...  but it's not a poutine anymore if you use grated cheese, or something other than fries.  I mean, fried gnocchi with gravy and grated mozzarella might taste nice (I wouldn't know!) but it's just not a poutine!\n\nI personally allow only one deviation and still call it poutine, albeit with a modifier.  In Qu\u00e9bec, for at least 30-40 years (maybe more, I haven't investigated the origins) we've had something called \"Italian Poutine\".  The allowed deviation is that you use a basic Italian tomato and meat sauce (bolognese?) instead of the basic brown poutine gravy.  But you have to still use french fries and cheese curds.  The reason I \"allow\" it is that it's been an established fixture in many places since long before the rest of Canada and the world discovered poutine.  Many hot dog/burger/fries places that offer poutine have been offering it for a long time, due to having the italian meat sauce on hand for \"michigan hot dogs\" (basically a steamed dog in the standard bun, topped with meat sauce, though some people will still add chopped raw onions and/or coleslaw.)",

It's about layering flavor, and honestly while there is a big slow cooking portion of it, it's not a recipe that is best suited to just dumping raw ingredients into your crockpot.  \n\nStart sweating a soffritto in a dutch oven, that's diced onion, carrrot and celery.  Then brown your meat in the same pot and toss in some salt and pepper, and maybe some tomato paste.  Once browned deglaze it with some white wine or stock.  Add milk and tomatoes and then slow cook it for awhile until the fat has separated.  \n\nI hate to be so prescriptive but if you aren't basically doing most of this you aren't making a bolognese.  There is certainly room for derivation but like...you're simply just making something completely different.",

That one person adds olives to doesn't their Bolognese make it any less authentic than the next grandma's two houses over. Both are delicious in their own right\n\nNo food is truly authentic anymore and anyone can cook whatever they goddamn well please and call it what it reminds them of and the \"that's not Bolognese, or jollof, or whatever bullshit gatekeeping the food police do can find creative uses with their Nana's wooden spoon and their nether regions.",

Like adding a bit of fish sauce at the end, the olives probably lift the flavor quite a bit. I probably will try making this myself sometime--only I wouldn't call it a bolognese. Bolognese does not, in fact, contain herbs. I'm lactose intolerant, so I wouldn't add milk. That's at least two degrees of separation from the actual recipe, so I wouldn't claim to have made bolognese. I would say that my recipe was inspired by a bolognese, and no one and nobody could claim I was being disingenuous. Does that make sense?",

Food is for enjoying and sharing and having fun. I do some wacky shit myself to all kinds of recipes. I\u2019ll throw some frozen peas in my carbonara or use whatever leftover canned/jarred olives I have around in my puttanesca. I\u2019ll break my spaghetti in half or use milk to quickly tenderize meat instead of a long braise. \n\nI\u2019m just wondering where you got the idea to call this bolognese? Maybe it\u2019s a regional thing in the UK where you use it like Americans use the word ragu or gravy to refer to any tomato-based sauce? Because there\u2019s nothing here other than the onions and tomatoes that even resembles a bolognese sauce. To me, this post is approaching rage-bait\u2026",

Personally, a bolognese in my opinion has meat that\u2019s been simmered for hours. All your recipes except the vegan one have ground beef (I use a mix of beef and pork) and the vegan one attempts to replace the meat with lentils.\n\nIt does seem like a good slow cooking recipe and I don\u2019t hate the addition of olives. I\u2019d just call it like a tomato sauce or vegetarian ragu or something. There\u2019s no reason to bring the word bolognese into the conversation. But again that could just be my regional use of the word coming into play. Do you call all kinds of tomato sauces bologneses?\n\nETA: wait does your recipe have meat? I just re-read your comments and you do mention \u201cmince\u201d which I probably glossed over because it didn\u2019t register as meat for me and I didn\u2019t see any in the pics.",

The UK cups are 250mls and US cups are 240mls, so UK half cups are 125mls whereas US half cups are 120mls (quarter cups tend to be the same at 60mls). However for most recipes the difference is small and won't affect the finished dish.",

I guess it doesn't matter that much (it's a 4% difference), but I'm going to try to use the US measurements as much as possible. I also have a recipe book from Australia and apparently their tbs are 4 tsp. That's way weirder.",

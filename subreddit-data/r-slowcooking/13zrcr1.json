            "comment": "A really straight forward, fast and flavourful Sunday morning soup. No it hasn't got meat! No it doesn't look beautiful but what I was craving was brought to fruition. As usual this was made in a 1.5L Slow Cooker, set to high for just over an hour. The pasta turned out soft and fresh and the leek still had a slight crispness.\n\n400g can of sliced mushrooms in butter sauce\n\n4 cloves of garlic crushed\n\n2 cups boiled water + 2 sachets of chicken noodle flavour\n\n3 layers of leek stem sliced thinly \n\n3tsp basil, 1tsp rosemary, 1tsp sage\n\nStirred in about 100g pasta shells\n\nAt the hour mark mixed up half cup of boiled water with 4 heaped tbsp of skim milk powder and stirred through as pictured 2nd.\n\nServed up with (optional) chopped black olives, grated edam cheese and diced roasted cashews.",

Cornstarch and hot liquids aren't necessarily good for a gravy, but not bad really. Anyway add that mixture to your crock pot, that should be good for whisking into a cup or so of broth that's sitting there. Honestly cornstarch isn't my gravy but it's probably better mixed in to a liquid that isn't really hot. It's thicker than doing a 1 tbsp butter to flour roux. So just be careful while mixing it. Probably perfect for a crock pot really.\n\n\nAnyway mix it in slowly, it shouldn't clump for a gravy and only add it till the mixture coats the back of a spoon.",

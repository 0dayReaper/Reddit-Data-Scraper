With the mess it made, I'm not pushing my luck again, though.",

If your crock pot is not already hot, it is a good idea to lower the temperature of your oven and heat it gradually.\n\nAfter your food has cooked for the appropriate time, turn off the oven and allow it to cool. After fifteen minutes, you should be able to safely remove your crock pot without the risk of it cracking.\n\nhttps://tastylicious.com/crock-pot-oven-safe/",

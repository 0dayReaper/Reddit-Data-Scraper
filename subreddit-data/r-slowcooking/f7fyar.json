I'm driving home for Thanksgivin', car is loaded up with about half a weeks worth of sundry items like clothes, videogames, my dog, etc. Heading up to my parents place there's a curve in the highway as it tracks through a city, if you live in that city(which I used to), you know that non natives will freak out and drop from 60 to 30 in span of a 100 feet which is pretty jarring. Following distance, set, brakes applied, slowly so as to alert the person behind me that hey we're all going to collectively slow down here on this turn. NOPE. Rammed from behind car, the driver behind me gets under my car flipping mine into a rollover. Dust settles and I unclip myself and guide my dog out of what's left of the car. Somehow, I'm fine, dog is somehow fine and we're sitting by the edge of the road watchin the emergency folks come deal with everything. The time comes get what's left of my car out of here, they go to flip it back over and out through one of the shattered windows tumbles my crockpot which had up until this point survived the ordeal, but not any further. \"Noooo, my crockpot\" Somehow that was the worst bit of the whole accident. I liked that crockpot and had planned some tasty stuff for Thanksgiving.   \n\n\nIf you've read this whole thing you're a trooper. Gold Star for you.",

And Yes I'll concede it's more like steamed turkey loin ( if you want golden run it under broiler for a few minutes)\n\nBut house smells amazing, and even better, it's Not hot and since my  Aromaware Pro Multicooker switches to keep warm, I can forget about it for a few hours if I want and it will still be sliceable.\n\nRecipe in comments",

            "comment": "Recipe\n\nOne package Turkey loin\n\nSeasonings of choice ( I used Penzey's Mural of flavor, Salt- no exact measurements I just eyeballed it) \n\nOlive oil about a tablespoon\n\nCarrots( I had half a bag of baby carrots but you could use three whole carrots, washed and peeled)\n\nOnion cut in 4ths\n\n3 whole celery stalks cut in half or thirds to fit slow cooker.\n\n1/ 4 cup water or chicken broth\n\nTake turkey loin out of package. Pat each piece dry with paper towels. Coat loin with olive oil Season with salt, and any other herbs or spices you wish. Set aside.\n\nIn your slow cooker layer in the the vegetables to form a sort of rack. Put the turkey loin on top of vegetables. Add water. Cook on high for 2-3 hours or until internal temp registers 165 F. Let rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing.. \n\nYou should now have sliceable Turkey for sandwiches and salads.\n\nNotes: works for chicken breasts too. Also probably could do a bone in turkey breast or chicken breast. \n\nAfter two hours of cook time, my vegetables still had life in them so I added some garlic cloves and a few more vegetables out of my veggie scrap stock making bag with some more water and  am going to cook it on high for an hour for some stock/broth.\n\nProbably make a chilled fennel broccoli sunflower seed soup in my slow cooker with the stock later this evening. Chilled soup and turkey with cranberry mayo mustard for lunches will be good this week, it's supposed to be hot here.",

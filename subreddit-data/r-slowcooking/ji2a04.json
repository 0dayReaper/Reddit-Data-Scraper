I\u2019ve actually found corn flour and it was a completely different texture than corn starch, more like a more finely ground cornmeal. It does contain corn starch just like white wheat flour contains wheat starch. The only reason I bring it up is because I first learned about it when a friend of mine from Louisiana was talking about using corn flour to fry catfish. I had never seen nor heard of it and figured it must be a Louisiana thing until I found some at an Asian market of all places. There are some places that do call cornstarch corn flour, but I want to point out that yes, there is corn flour that is not the same as cornstarch.",

Cut it in fine pieces, about three centimeters long, and add some ground pepper to it. I also add paprika at this point and let it dry a little. The paprika should cover all the pieces. This recipe is for about 1kg of meat,adjust other ingredients based on this. \n\nWhile it dries a little, chop some 0,5kg of mushrooms (Paris is great), and finely chop one onion.\n\nNow, heat the pan, add butter, and sear the meat in batches. Do not add too much at the same time lest they get overcooked or chewy. The pan should be hot again every time you add a handful of beef.\n\nWith all beef seared, add a cup of cognacq and let it cook. You may light in fire it now if you want to show off and do it flamb\u00e9, or simply let it dry a little. Now, add the mushrooms and let it reduce for a little time.\n\nFinally, add two cups of light cream, and start mixing with ketchup, something like five spoons for starters, and then I taste it. Sometimes I add a spoonful of mustard, and I usually ground some nutmeg and add cinnamon to taste. It really takes some tasting to get it right.",

Covered it with cabbage..quite a bit. Then those flavors do wonders for the roast. But. Although I started it at high for ahour then turned to low, when it should have been done I noticed it just was too tough, not totally done. So I cut it and put in my blue enamel roaster, covered it with the juices, threw on the cabbage and roasted it for the last hour. Much better. Some things work better in the crock pot I guess..",

Either way it will go under the broiler to get color. \n\nAlso completely defrosting your meat before cooking and possibly even letting it rest on the counter for about an hour before roasting will really help the end texture. Less time at roasting temperature in the oven=less time for your meat to lose moisture but you also don\u2019t want to undercook it. Bringing the internal temp up to 40-60 before roasting means that\u2019s less work the oven has to do",

In fact, taking the lid off to stir food causes the slow cooker to lose a significant amount of heat, extending the cooking time required. Therefore, it is best not to remove the lid for stirring.\n\nAccording to crock-pot.com you are wrong.\n\nhttps://www.crock-pot.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-crockpot-Site/default/Support-Show?cfid=help-and-how-to-use-cooking-tips-faq#:~:text=Due%20to%20the%20nature%20of,remove%20the%20lid%20for%20stirring.",

Your crackpot does NOT drop 15 degrees because you popped the lid off and stirred it and then placed it back on once it's at a sufficient cooking temp.\n\nSourcr: Physics and Newton's law of thermodynamics",

Even if I move a regular stovetop pot off the heat and leave it open, it will take minutes for the temperature to drop by any significant amount.\n\nAlso, on one hand you say that the drop is worse the hotter the bulk is and on the other hand you say it's worse earlier, when the bulk is obviously still cooler.\n\nI'm sorry, but this all seems pretty contradictory.",

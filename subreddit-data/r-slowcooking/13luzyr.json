It helped contain the water content and the juice from the recipe was very reduced, caramelized the onions, and concentrated into the meat well. Each bite was bursting with orange (Clementine/lime lol) when it was all done.",

When I asked her what she would do differently the only thing she said was that I should have marinated the butt overnight then dump all those juices into the crock pot before cooking. I peppered her with questions. She said the flavor was good but it could be less juicy. I even pulled the pork and roasted it in a pan before going back into the pot with reduced sauce.",

Carnitas is inherently juicy from the marinade and when you put it back in the sauce, it took away from the crispy texture and doubled up on the moisture factors (internally and then as a coating) turning the texture into mush.",

Wait until it gets to about 375-400f. Add the tortilla flat and turn over after a few seconds (the heat/oil spreads to the edges and makes it sort of vibrate in a flat disc. Turn it over and use tongs to manipulate the bottom face to make better contact with the pan. I pinch an edge of the tortilla and leverage the rest of the tortilla into the oil. This tells me where the best spot for the fold is gonna be. After a few seconds, I fold it up and let it cook on one side while holding up the top half so it doesn\u2019t sit in the oil completely flat. That\u2019s what gives me room for fillings without splitting. Then I flip it over once the shell starts to get a little brown and do the same for the other side.",

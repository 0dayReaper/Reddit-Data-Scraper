The V8 instead of broth is my family\u2019s key lol and add Worcestershire to taste. Just coat stew meat in a mix of flour or whatever seasoning you prefer before adding it in the slow cooker. Another thing you can also add green beans and peas or onions or celery or whatever. If you\u2019re feeling extra lazy, use canned veggies but add them 1-2 hours before the potatoes and stew meat finish cooking. And be sure to drain them before adding the veggies! Sorry y\u2019all, I\u2019m not much of a cook! I was just excited to have made my first successful slow cooker attempt! \ud83d\ude02",

Looking to make space in the storage area a few years later, the chemists decided to try it again, and discovered that the long fermented sauce had mellowed and was now palatable. In 1838 the first bottles of \"Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire sauce\" were released to the general public.\"",

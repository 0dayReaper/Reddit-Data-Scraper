Start subbing things out, like sausage for the chicken, and you start to get something that's quite enjoyable. Also, skip that microwave shit and saute what needs saut\u00e9ed, use shallots instead of onions, and it's quite tasty.",

You're basically sweating the onions, and making a tomato basil roux kinda...paste, but I don't know how much that little roux can actually thicken things up, especially at the start of cooking. If I was making this in the interest solely for ease of making, I'd just toss the onions and all that stuff you're supposed to microwave (minus the flour and the olive oil) into the crock and goto town. If at the end of cooking you want to thicken it, just use a cornstarch slurry. That would be the fastest/least fussy way to go about it and still attain a pretty similar result.",

While I agree that some people look at slow cooking as an \"easy button\" for dinner, others see it as a different way to develop flavors and cook proteins. You certainly *can* cut corners by microwaving some ingredients or neglecting to sear off meat before adding it, the same can be said for any other method of cooking.",

Take any soup or chili or stew. You can make it on the stove top in 90 minutes tops, but you have to babysit it. Toss it all in the slow cooker, 8 hours later it's probably at least 80% as good as stove top and you didn't have to do much at all. That's worth the trade off sometimes. \n\nHow about a favorite, pulled pork. Is it better to smoke it for 12+ hours? Yes, yes it is. Do most people have a pellet grill/smoker? not really. Is the slow cooker at least 80% as good? Absolutely. Most any meats can fit into this category. \n\nNow, don't get me wrong, 80% as good as \"fucking amazing\" is still utterly plate clearing good, but it won't be next level, and that's absolutely fine.",

Microwave for 5 minutes, stirring every 90 seconds or so. (The mixture will be pasty and look weird but don\u2019t worry it will all be okay in the end). Add the mixture to the slow cooker.\n\nAdd broth, tomatoes, chicken, salt and pepper to the slow cooker. Stir.\n\nCover and cook on LOW for 4-6 hours or on HIGH for 3-4 hours (or until chicken is very tender).\n\nRemove the lid use a fork to remove the chicken out of the slow cooker. And add in tortellini and spinach, Parmesan cheese and warmed cream (cream should be warmed because it may cause curdling if added in cold).\n\nOn a cutting board, shred or cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. Add the chicken back into the slow cooker. Put the lid back on and cook on HIGH for about 10 more minutes, or until the tortellini are cooked through. Ladle into serving bowls and enjoy!",

I served it with a salad and some crusty bread to mop up the sauce that was left in our bowls.  Just wonderful for a cold winter night and a great choice for a group.  I made some modifications - I substituted hot Italian sausage for the chicken, added a little extra garlic and some sun dried tomatoes in olive oil. The sauce could easily be made ahead and then just add the tortellini and spinach right before serving.  I agree with some of the comments about it not really being a soup.  It is more like a thick, rich sauce.",

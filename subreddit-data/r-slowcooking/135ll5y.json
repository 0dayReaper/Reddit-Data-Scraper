    "postText": "I'm completely new to cooking so apologise if this sounds stupid. How do you cook multiple foods in the slowcooker? Let's say I want to cook sweet potatoes and then a chicken. What do I do after cooking the sweet potato (like refridgerate it or something(, and is there anything I should do before cooking the chicken?",

            "comment": "You can cook things at the same time. I\u2019ve done several meals where I simultaneously cook meat and a side. Just know that potatoes will probably take longer to cook than chicken. \n\nNow, maybe you\u2019re talking about cooking bulk for meal prep? In which case, sure you can slow cook them, but the best bang for your buck is baking/roasting the chicken and potatoes in the oven (assuming you have one available). Probably a better end result and quicker. (Though I\u2019ve had some pretty tasty baby potatoes cooked in the slow cooker!)\n\nDepends on your goal and appliances available. No oven? Then yes, you can slow cook them separately. It just uses a lot of time/power for something that can cook pretty quickly other ways. I cook (giant, whole) sweet potatoes for my family of four in the microwave in ~10-15 minutes. That would take HOURS in the slow cooker. Then chicken would be another few hours.",

If you cook your potatoes first, and then have to cook chicken for 4ish more hours, you could let the potatoes cool on the counter for a while. Then either put them in the refrigerator or just leave them out. Depends on your tolerance for food safety rules.",

Just get used to making a few meals with your crockpot like maybe 3 or 4 meals that turn out good before trying to do more.  Sometimes I cook meat in the crockpot and potatoes in the oven or on top of the stove.",

            "comment": "I would usually do one of the foods in the slow cooker, and do the others in other ways. \n\nLike slow-cooked chicken, and then do the sweet potatoes in the oven or steam them stovetop. \n\nYou can do a one-pot meal and put the sweet potatoes and the chicken in at the same time, but, probably your sweet potatoes will be total mush by the time the chicken is ready. It works better to put in whole or halved potatoes in with a whole chicken. Or you could put in small pieces of chicken and big pieces of sweet potato and after 6 hours on low they might be ok. \n\nIf a one-pot meal like a stew, it still will be even better to accompany it with oven-baked biscuits or rice done stovetop or in a rice cooker.",

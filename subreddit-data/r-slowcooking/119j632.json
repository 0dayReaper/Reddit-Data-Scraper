It was a Madhur Jaffrey recipe and she knows her shit. \n\nIt was just\u2026 one texture. \n\nI am neurodivergent with food texture issues. Is there something I can add to my lentils (this was onions, pepper, garlic, turmeric, coriander, ghee, water, and lentils) to change up the texture?",

Make a thickish lentil stew and blend, then use that as a sauce for a casserole. Maybe hunks of potatoes with yogurt.  Or rice? Do you think that might work?",

Also, knowing the exact recipe would help.  \n\nWith that said, are you starting with dry or canned lentils?  If dry, maybe cook them not so much or remove some from your cooker before they're \"done\" and toss them back in the last 15 mins to heat them up.  If canned, rinse and bake at 325 deg F for 15 mins to add some tougher bits.   Maybe adding in a vegetable like carrots would help? Or maybe some TVP?   Is it dry?  Maybe make it saucier.   Add some xanthan gum or avocado to make the sauce smoother/silkier.  Maybe grate some raddish on top when serving?",

Experiment adding the lentils halfway through the cooking process perhaps or other appropriate time you feel?",

            "comment": "TBH I think you are always going to end up with mushy lentils if you use slow cooker. They just arent going to have any bite if you cook them that long. It's not a bad thing if you are wanting a lentil soup ([my favorite](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/lentil-soup-recipe-1947017) that I just leave in the slow cooker and the lentils break down so I don't have to puree like he calls for) or a dal which is a creamy consistency ([this site](https://myheartbeets.com/#search/q=lentil) is almost exclusively Instant Pot recipes but I cooked them in IP first to understand taste/texture then figured out how to time for slow cooker but it will give you an idea of spices to use). I am confused what you mean by a texture issue but then ask about spices. Are you looking for taste? Edited to correct meaning\n\nETA: I got to thinking that if you want some texture within a lentil dish you could, using the lentil soup for an example, add additional diced carrots, celery, etc at the last 20 minutes of cooking time so they still have bite. The lentils themselves are going to either be uncooked or mushy but the veggies would give texture you are looking for?",

            "comment": "I generally don't like the pasty texture of most legumes myself, but I find myself tolerating it more in 3 cases:\n\n\\- if they are strongly seasoned with a flavor I really enjoy (for example, a good curry) the texture becomes less of an issue for me\n\n\\- if they are firm enough not to turn into a paste, and they are mixed in with other ingredients (such as vegetables) that have other interesting textures, getting the occasional legume texture is less of an issue -- and I think OP was asking for more texture variety, so this may be the way to go for them!\n\n\\- if they turn into more of a smooth paste, again with an interesting flavor that covers the legume's flavor, I may enjoy it more.  One example is Mexican refried beans, when seasoned properly.\n\nSo, I guess it's the in-between state I hate the most: when the legumes are firm enough to hold together, but still immediately become pasty once you bite down on them.  Either keep them firmer (to the consistency of a soft peanut?) or make them really mushy so they can be turned into a paste that will readily absorb all sorts of flavors, or disperse among other foods with different textures.",

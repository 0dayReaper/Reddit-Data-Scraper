            "comment": "Slow cookers are extremely easy to use so it's pretty hard to screw up recipes in them. Like their entire purpose is set it and forget it.\n\nFor the actual recipe, that looks to be very similar to a Mississippi pot roast. It's a love it or hate it type dish, not many people think it's just \"meh\". Just wanted to point that out if that you're disappointed, try a different roast recipe - I'm personally in the hate it category \n\nOther things you can do is brown the meat in a pan before the slow cooker - that is arguably it's biggest downfall, slow cookers never brown meat themselves. It's a completely optional step that some people swear by. \n\nThe liners are another personal call, I never use them as they always give me pause because I dunno, plastic and food don't seem like a good mix.\n\nOh and don't open the lid unless absolutely necessary - slow cookers don't need stirred and it can take up to 40 minutes for it to come back to temperature depending on how long the lid was off. I only take it off if I need to taste for seasoning at the end of a cook or to add a thickening agent like cornstarch.",

The heat of the air that escapes when you open the lid is negligible. \n\nOpening the lid briefly to stir or add an ingredient has very little effect on the temperature of the food, and does not change the overall cooking time at all.",

Eg, when you have preheated your oven, all the heat is stored in the air inside the oven. Opening the oven door to put in your food  lets a huge amount of that heat out, that's why we do it quickly. And if we have to open the oven door to turn the food or add something else, we know we have just let all the heat out.\n\nIt's easy to see how that line of thought propagated to crockpot cooking.",

What you're aiming for is called the Maillard reactions, where the proteins are partially broken down then recombine into a variety of more complex and flavorful compounds.\n\nThe trick is that the Maillard reactions happen around 240\u00b0 F,  so if there is any moisture on the surface the temperature won't get high enough until all of the water has boiled away. That means you run the risk of actually cooking the roast rather than just browning the surface.\n\nI get around this by putting my roast on a rack in the fridge for about a day beforehand, with a pan underneath to catch drippings. I also rub the roast down with up to three things depending on what my other plans are. Salt is safest, but only does the drying. Cornstarch also pulls out moisture, and can also carry through and help thicken the liquid in the pot. Finally, baking soda not only helps dry but a basic environment can encourage the Maillard reactions, though you also want to be mindful of what effect it might have on your final product.",

            "comment": "This meal is pretty hands off, so here are general tips:\n\nBiggest thing - sear your meat before adding it. As others have mentioned. The Maillard reaction will result in a delicious flavor to the meat. That seared meat will leave fond - the crusty brown stuff on the pan, use wine or vinegar or even some of your broth to remove it from the pan and add to crockpot - simply splash in after removing the meat and clean the fond off with a utensil - more delicious flavor for your crockpot!\n\nBay leaves are always good to have on hand.\n\nFresh herbs (not for a Mississippi Pot Roast, though) are always a great addition to a slow cooked meal. Binding them in twine makes it easy to fish out and toss when finished.\n\nCorn starch (as a thickening agent) is always great if you cook a roast and want to use the liquid as a gravy. Add at the end.\n\nRead recipes before cooking. You might miss a step or add a veggie too early and overcook it. Always read your recipes.\n\nLook up mirepoix - that is usually a good addition to a crockpot meal.\n\nCrockpots are wonderful - enjoy the journey!",

Figure an hour for prep time (start around 9 hours before you want to eat) and if it takes less time than that to prep (it probably will) then that's fine because when the crock pot is on low it won't hurt the food to be in there another half hour or so. \n\nMake sure the outlet that you plan to plug the crock pot into actually works before you use it. I use a night light to test mine, since my slow cooker doesn't have a light. It will warm up a bit though, so after 15-20 mins I can feel the warmth off it when it's on. \n\nI always grease my crock pot with extra virgin olive oil. Never tried it with that recipe though.\n\nAnd as for recipes, I've got an even simpler one: Just chicken thighs, season them, add oil, and let them cook on low for 8 hours, they'll be cooking in their own juices and fall-apart tender at the end. If you use breasts instead, add chicken broth.",

Heck, you could probably cut it with a plastic spoon.\n\nYou may find you can skip the butter like I do to save a bit more money, and it's really not a necessary ingredient.\n\nGood luck with your new slow cooking lifestyle!",

Avocado works great because it has a high smoke point. Add the meat to the pan making sure it has good contact. Leave it for several minutes without moving it around. After about 5 minutes, you can check it to see if it has a good crust. If it sticks, it\u2019s not ready. Continue doing all or most sides of the meat. You\u2019ll probably want to turn the heat down to medium-high about halfway through to make sure nothing burns. Add to the crockpot and continue the recipe how it\u2019s written.",

If you enjoy onions, I would then cook up some onions in the same pan you browned the roast in (do not clean it after, let those drippings and flavour get into the onions). Then when the onions become translucent you can put those in your crock pot.\n\nYou will want to put the liner in first (though a liner is not necessary). Then put your roast in, along with the onions if you have chosen to put them in. Then put your seasonings over top of the roast and add those pepperochinis. \n\nYou will want this roast to cook over 8 hours. So put it on low. Low and slow is a good way to cook this. The roast cooking in the crock pot will create it's own liquid or juice, so thats why you don't have to add water. \n\nYou are also adding butter, so don't worry about putting oil in. I usually add oil in whenever I cook anything directly in the pot so it won't stick to the pot. But you are also using a liner. The butter and juices will make a nice gravy at the end. If the juice is too watery after the 8 hours is up, throw in a little bit of cornstarch slurry (cornstarch mixed with water) to thicken it up.",

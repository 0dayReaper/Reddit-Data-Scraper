    "postText": "I'm hosting a brunch party for a large group at noon. I want to make one of the egg dishes in advance so I have less work to do the day of.\n\nMy current plan is egg muffins with egg beaters, spinach, tomatoes and onion. I'll freeze them after baking them and then the day of keep them warm/serve them out of a crock pot.\n\nDoes anyone have tips or a better idea? I think this recipe freezes pretty well? Do you think I can move them from the freezer to the fridge to thaw them overnight and then bring them up to temperature in the crock pot? Or microwave them to bring them back up to temperature and then keep them warm in the crock pot?\n\nI will also have a breakfast casserole with eggs, cheese, sausage, onion and potato. I want to make a large batch. I'm thinking the best way to do this may be do some prep the night before (browning sausage, etc) and then bake it the morning of in a 9x13 and transfer to the crock pot to keep warm. Any thoughts or ideas here? I've seen some recipes to bake in the crock pot for about 8 hours, which doesn't line up with my schedule of getting up around 8 and leaving my house for the party around 11:30. It is hard to tell if those recipes have the same large batch as a 9x13. And those recipes all use frozen potatoes, I would like to use fresh.",

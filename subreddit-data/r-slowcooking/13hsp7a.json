    "postText": "Hi everyone\nNew to slow cooking! I have a Fissler multifunction cooker with pressure and slow cooking (can control exact temp)\n\nI've been trying to cook things like brisket and chuck using slow cooking at lower temps to try and keep the meat as juice as possible. I usually cook at about 180f, but last time tried brisket at 160f for 24 hours and was still very tough where the connective tissue still was very visible and not broken down. I was kinda disappointed and as a last ditch effort I just turned on the pressure function and cooked for about 45 minutes and it came out a lot better and actually edible.\n\nMy main question is simply, is it worth it if I'm just cooking meat with a bit of broth? Even if I add veggies like carrots, if I cut them large enough they'll maintain their bite. \n\nWhat does slow cooking achieve that pressure cooking doesn't in a lot less time?\nAny differences in the texture of the food for example?\nGenuinely curious btw, I can't find a good use case for myself",

The water won't reach more than 212 except if pressurised, and even then it'll reach about 250\nIf the slow cooker is simmering, then that means that it's at 212 or just below, so no matter what the temp is, it won't go above it",

It will bubble and potentially burn. So I'd believe the extreme temperature level.\n\nRegular Ovens go above 100\u00b0C - why wouldn't Slow Cookers?",

I've had some great brisket and ribs from a pressure cooker that were done in an hour or two\n\nThe only times a slow cooker will have the advantage are being more hands off, cooking stews etc that use veggies/starches/potatoes etc, and fattier cuts of meat that love long slow cooking.... And even some of those you'll find do just fine in pressure cookers (like pulled pork). But pressure cookers are more hands on, you can't set a beef stew overnight and go to sleep... And they turn most starchy veggies to mush. HTH",

(The mixture will be pasty and look weird but don\u2019t worry it will all be okay in the end). \nAdd the mixture to the slow cooker*.\n* Add broth, tomatoes, chicken, salt and pepper to the slow cooker. Stir.\n* Cover and cook on LOW for 4-6 hours or on HIGH for 3-4 hours (or until chicken is very tender).\n* Remove the lid and add in tortellini and spinach, Parmesan cheese and warmed cream (cream should be warmed because it may cause curdling if added in cold).\n* Use a fork to remove the chicken out of the slow cooker. On a cutting board, shred or cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. \n* Add the chicken back into the slow cooker. Put the lid back on and cook on HIGH for about 10 more minutes, or until the tortellini are cooked through. Ladle into serving bowls and enjoy!",

Start with warmed broth, and slowly add in flower a spoon at a timex whisking to break apart the clumps in between every spoon. When its done just throw it in.\n\nFlower is a great thickener, but it clumps and gets gross if you just throw it in. The trick above is to ensure sure the flower doesnt clump.\n\nUsually you just use melted butter or water, but you dont want to water down the soup so just use broth.",

We give them a couple of hours to post the recipe because we know crock-pot cooking is for people who think in terms of hours not minutes.",

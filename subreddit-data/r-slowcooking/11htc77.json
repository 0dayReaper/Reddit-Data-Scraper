Add veggies desired... onions, peppers, carrots, taters, etc., and chicken broth or veggie broth or cream o' chicken soup; dilute with water as needed.  Cook for hours and it will be delicious.  Season as needed.",

            "comment": "I have made two rounds of this and am loving it! Instead of noodles, I decided to try lentils. it works with rice and other things, but the lentils feel healthier. I usually buy a rotisserie chicken and make many meals out of it, but you can also cook up any cut of chicken. In my pot I put avocado oil and my diced carrots, onions, celery along with garlic and ginger and saute until tender. I then add two containers of chicken broth and seasonings and bring to a boil. Then add lentils and turn down to a simmer and let it go for awhile. I add the chicken at the end so it doesn't over cook..I usually have a standard garlic herb seasoning type salt, and pepper of course. I just read another thread abt soup that suggested adding lemon juice and sometimes zest or apple cider vinegar for some acid. Going to try that, but I am loving this soup.",

I went very easy on the salt because you can add it while eating. The rosemary and thyme added an interesting flavor, not sure I'd use them again, but what else to use.",

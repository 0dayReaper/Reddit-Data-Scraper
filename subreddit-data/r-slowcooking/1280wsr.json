But then I also cook taco pasta casserole and tofu in my slow cooker so you can't trust me.\n\nFrom the 365 Days of Slow Cooking blog: \n\nhttps://www.365daysofcrockpot.com/slow-cooker-tortellini-spinach-soup/",

I corrected mine with Greek yogurt and balsamic vinegar drizzles but still was not impressed  enough to make it again.\n\nThat's okay, not every recipe is for everybody. \n\nBut I always feel like heretic and will burned at the stake by the Slow Cooker Inquisitor Generals because I also hate \"The Roast\". I just stay off those threads though because there's nothing to be had by wrecking other people's enjoyment of it. \n\nAlso OP- it's worth making both these very  popular recipes ( The Soup and The ( Mississippi Pot Roast) at least once, you may find a new favorite!",

And I'm sure both those ingredients are for the flavor, so reducing them would ruin it. \n\nI too stay off those posts. They aren't for me, but they may be just that thing for someone else.",

I also use lower calorie ingredients (chicken tenders and fat free half and half). \n\nWhen it comes to any recipe, tweak it to your tastes and needs. Add a little more salt. Add oregano or thyme. \n\nFor my soup, a dash of cayenne and a splash of red wine vinegar gave it the pop it needed. I'm also just going to make a proper a roux next time.",

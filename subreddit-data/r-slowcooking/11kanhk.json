Threw them whole in the freezer to use for my chili. Grabbed 3 or 4 out. Let them thaw and proceeded as usual. Holy cats! My hands got itchy and swelled a bit. These guys were HOT. They tasted great!! But I definitely invested in a box of gloves and actually have been using them in other applications. \n\nGetting old isn\u2019t for the faint of heart, my friends.

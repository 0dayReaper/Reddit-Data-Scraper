It all starts like you prepare for a typical roast with vegetables, brown the meat and add them and then season  - They will probably call for ras-al-hanout but you can make that spice blend wiht what you have on hand.  Coriander, anise, cinnamon, nutmeg, turmeric, and ginger are pretty key to pulling this offf, the rest of the stuff lime lavender or other fragrants can be subbed for.  \n\nSearch beef Tagine and also Moroccan pot roast and you\u2019ll get a few different recipes and you can just use one or use some aspects of differenr ones that you think are efficient and utilaize what you have in hand or access to.  One of the common ingredients will be some dried fruit.  You can substitute the ones you have around or like the best.  I usually use raisins or prunes and apricots. Then there is mint and some citrus depending on the fruits you elect to use.",

            "comment": "BBQ Beef. Cut your chuck into pieces and put it in the slow cooker with 8-16 oz canned tomato sauce or crushed tomato, then fill an 8-oz tomato can twice with water, a couple of chopped onions, a chopped green or red pepper, 1 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp hot chili pepper (not the same as chili powder---you want a teensy of hot here), 1 tsp garlic powder, and now the most important ingredients: 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp clove, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 cup vinegar. Trust me on this, I have made BBQ Beef this way for almost seventy years  and you definitely want the cinnamon, clove, brown sugar, and vinegar---they are the soul of this thing. Cook this on High in your slow cooker for  five or six hours until the meat is totally falling apart. Then turn off the pot and take two forks and tear the meat apart. You can also lift some of it out onto a cutting board and whack it through a few times. What you want when you get done is a lot of beef in small pieces and a LOT of BBQ-tasting liquid with it. Taste it and add whatever you need to improve it like more salt or garlic or brown sugar. Stir it all up together. You want plenty of the sauce---this dish can handle quite a lot of sauce as you smash up the meat.  You can freeze the meat and sauce for future use in plastic containers with covers. Eat this on hamburger buns. You want the sauce to soak into the bun. You may even need a fork.",

            "comment": "Meat Cutter/Butcher here.\n\nIf you get a cut of chuck closer to the rib eye, usually the front six or so inches of a deboned chuck, you can cut along the \"eye line\" and separate the chuck eye from the boneless beef rib meat. \n\nThe  steak, try to keep it together as it's the end of a muscle and there's a lot of connective tissue... Eats as you'd imagine, mix of ribeye and chuck. Takes to every traditional beef flavor. Personally, I reverse sear these.\n\nThe boneless rib meat can be cooked as a long strip if you want some pink, or thinly sliced into \"beef sashimi\" after a light cook with some teriyaki sauce, or if you want to cook your meat through all the way, stir fry. \n\nI usually buy a chuck roast specifically for this when they go on sale, one to cut up and one to slow cook....Chucks these days are one of the few beef cuts to go on sale at all.\n\nChuck roast also takes well to Birria.\n\nHope this helped anyone.",

Turn it off, use a crappy bottle brush to hit the sides while it's still filled with hot water, and then dump to finish washing. Has always worked for me, but ymmv",

Cleaning the pot feels like cheating it is so easy.  Also, incredibly convenient to use the pot on the stove to saute/sear before adding to the slow cooker base.  Basic controls, consistent heating, I would definitely recommend it. Especially for the price.",

Quick wipe around and it's clean.",

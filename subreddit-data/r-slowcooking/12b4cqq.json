Cooked it on low for about 6 and a half hours.\r  \n\r  \nI followed this recipe [https://justisafourletterword.com/slow-cooker-beef-and-guinness-stew/](https://justisafourletterword.com/slow-cooker-beef-and-guinness-stew/)\r  \n\r  \nIt came out pretty good, considering I've never made anything like this before. Just needed some salt, I didn't add any as I thought the beef broth would be enough. Also, I ended up using a little less meat than the recipe called for. It's definitely something I'll make again.",

In a shallow pan mix 2/3 C flour, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Coat chicken halves and place on top of sweet potatoes.  Next in a small bowl mix soup, orange juice, mushrooms, orange peel, brown sugar and 3 thsp of  flour. Pour over chicken and potatoes. Cook on low for 8 to 10 hours, on high 3 to 4 hours.\n\nPS tge flour coating makes a lot, so I just used that flour for the 3 tbsp needed in the sauce.",

Just plopped it on top of the dryer. I didn't think twice - the toilet and hand washing sink are behind a separate door, so in my mind the crockpot was in the laundry room, outside of the half bath. \n\nI made an amazing batch of meatballs, which everyone devoured, until my husband mentioned that \"mom cooked these in the bathroom!\" I tried defending myself, but was soon informed by my family that the half bath and laundry was *really* all one room, despite the dividing wall/door. I was outnumbered, and couldn't win. I moved the crockpot to the garage for the remainder of the kitchen remodel. \n\nNearly fifteen years later, and they still request \"Bathroom Barbecue Meatballs\" from time to time.",

Then dump in the onions, pepper, garlic, bay leaves, and coke around it the pork, not onto it so the rub doesn\u2019t get washed off. Sometimes I put in half a bundle of cilantro in with the crockpot to cook with the pork, Sometimes I don\u2019t. You do you. \n\nCook it on low for 8-10 hours\n\nThere will be a bit of liquid in the crock pot when you\u2019re done, but once you start to shred it up with tongs or whatever, it\u2019ll absorb most of it.\n\nOnce it\u2019s all shredded put all the meat on a cookie sheet and spread it out evenly, and throw some garlic salt over the top with some olive oil spread about. Put it in the oven on broil for 3-5 minutes (or whenever you think they\u2019re crispy enough) or just put it in at 350 for 5-10 minutes (or when crispy enough)\n\nLet them rest for a minute, then I like to get a ladle and pour some of the extra juice still in the crock pot onto the tray for some more bang pop and pow. If you put the meat back into the pot they\u2019ll get soggy again. \n\nI like to get my corn tortilla shell, add roughly 5 handfuls of cilantro, 14 limes, 1/2 lb of chihuahua cheese and some onions to the shell, and whatever room is left for meat, add that. \n\n\nThe biggest and best thing you can possibly do is use chihuahua cheese",

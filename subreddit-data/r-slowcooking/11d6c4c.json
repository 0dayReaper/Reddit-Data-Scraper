Currently have it on warm and it's holding at 200\\*F. \n\nWill it be safe or edible in 18 hours from now if I keep the liquid level up?  \n\nWill the chuck become tough or turn to an indistinguishable grey blob? \n\nIs there a better way to preserve this meal?",

Warm it up again tomorrow about an hour before dinner. \n\nOr take the meat and liquid out of the crock pot and put it into a pot with a lid and put that pot in the fridge. Reheat on the stove when you are ready to eat it.",

Heated it the next day for a couple of hours and it was fine, roast was tender, veggies were not over cooked and potatoes took on the flavor of the broth well. Thanks for everyone's help.\n\nEDIT: Oh now I see what you were referring to on your reply.",

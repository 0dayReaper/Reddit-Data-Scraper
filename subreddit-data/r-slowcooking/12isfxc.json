Everything else in the soup is a flavor drain (absorbs flavor).  Needs considerable more salt, a bit of acid would help, additional pepper, (red pepper flakes?) Worcestershire sauce/ Tobasco and garlic would help give it some flavor.",

Follow the recipe (which wasn't even easy because this clown-ass \"internet chef\" didn't even list a bunch of the ingredients and I had to figure them out through repeated viewings). Finally, after hours of work, we eat and I have never been so disappointed with a meal I've made before. Just incredibly bland. All the seasonings from the chicken thighs just absolutely lost in the soup. It was truly dreadful. I couldn't even bring myself to touch the leftovers.",

I didn\u2019t learn to cook until my early twenties. I was lucky- I had a roommate who told me I had to learn how to eat like an adult and my ex husband would eat almost anything and loved trying new things. \n\nHonestly, when I was first learning to cook this would have seemed \u201cadventurous\u201d to me but also easy to make as I could dump ingredients into the crock pot and go. But meals like that helped me to have the confidence to be able to make Cajun sausage and shrimp pasta that family begs for!",

They're a good starting point, and if made as-is, are terribly bland and dull.\n\nAs for \"the soup\", my additions are as follows:\n\n* made in a dutch oven\n* andouille sausage &amp; chicken thighs (season thighs with salt &amp; pepper)\n* about 10 cloves of garlic\n* white wine to deglaze\n* chicken stock (I never use broth cos I can season to taste)\n* Better than Bullion added to the stock (I use the stock you can get at Costco)\n* a shit-ton more herbs and spices in general, basil, rosemary, thyme, and white pepper\n* splash of fish sauce\n\nBrown the chicken, skin-on, throw in the sausage sliced in 1/2\" rounds cut on the diagonal. Chicken doesn't have to be done, just a nice color. Remove, add in diced onion and brown, throw in smashed garlic for about a minute or so till it's fragrant. Deglaze with white wine, dump in the chicken stock, a tablespoon or so of the Better than Bullion (to taste), add the rest of the ingredients back in, including cut up chicken thighs. Add a splash or so of fish sauce (for that umami punch) and season to taste. Some ppl really like chili flakes, but my husband doesn't like spicy food, and for him, the andouille sausage is spicy enough. Cook for how ever long it takes for the chicken and tortellini to cook through.",

TLDR; I love it.  \n\nThe slow cooker function is great (yes it's circular but it works for us) and I find that I don't need as much liquid in there as I did with the old slow cooker so things like chilli end up thicker.  \n\nThe air fryer is great, and you get like a little shelf so you can cook multiple things in the basket it at the same time.  However the basket has to sit inside your regular pot that you use for the other cooking functions, so the capacity for air frying isn't as big as the other cooking functions. \n\nI haven't got to grips with the pressure cooking fully yet, but it was great to cook some bulgar wheat and quinoa a couple of weeks ago for a salad in about 3 minutes start to finish.",

            "comment": "I have an 8qt instapot. By far the kitchen appliance I use the most. However it\u2019s not a fully functional slow cooker. The instapot has low and high slow cooker settings but they are equivalent to \u201ckeep warm,\u201d and low on a traditional crockpot IMO. there is no high setting. Additionally instapots heat from the bottom whereas crockpots have those really thick ceramic dishes to more evenly heat up. \n\nHowever; overall it\u2019s an amazing product. I eat a ton of rice so the rice cooker setting is great. The pressure cooking also makes soups so much faster so it\u2019s great for week nights. And as long as your recipes can be slow cooked on low it\u2019s works great for that too. I made \u201cthe soup\u201d yesterday via the slow cooker setting and it came out great. \n\n\nEdit: technically the instapot terms are less, normal, and more. Not low, medium, and high. Also here is a website that contains the actual temperatures of the instant pot vs traditional crockpots. \n\nhttps://www.everydaycheapskate.com/instant-pot-is-fabulous-but-its-slow-cook-mode-is-one-big-disappointment/",

Of course, the slow cooker will cost much less, but if you need the other functions having it all in one is the way to go. The slow cook function works fine for our uses, nothing to complain about. You can even sous vide at a certain temperature for precise low cooking.",

I seen the price and thought, \"mm .. no thanks\"  I tried an air fryer before, but that felt like a toaster oven with a fan in it.  It did make a good souffle, but that didn't justify the price.  Meanwhile, it sat there taking up space, so I gave it to my neighbor.  We have a large family, so the space constraints for cooking inside the machine bothered me.  Guess I'd rather use a stove, oven, or grill.  \n\nA kitchen appliance has to show me plenty of purpose or I won't fall for those gadgets anymore.  I'll tell you what I really do like that was about the same amount of money - a Kitchen Aid stand mixer with a few attachments.  It mixes bread dough, pasta dough, makes homemade whipped cream or whips egg whites into nice peaks.  It comes with a mixer, dough hook, and whisk.  I like the pasta roller/cutter, the little food processor, the grinder, and the strainer attachments.  I've had mine for years, and I love it.  We use it all the time.",

Like other electric pressure cookers it isn't as good a pressure cooker as a stovetop unit; this is why there are special cookbooks for electric pressure cookers, to avoid pointing out how often they fall short. They aren't very good slow cookers; they seem to run too hot for a long slow cook so going to work and coming home to dinner isn't reliable. I do better making rice in a pot than the Instant Pot. The yogurt maker is just silly; I had a friendly argument with a friend and contact time making yogurt with the Instant Pot turned out in side-by-side comparison to be more than using a pot. \n\nMy heart sinks when I'm faced with a customer who has Instant Pot.",

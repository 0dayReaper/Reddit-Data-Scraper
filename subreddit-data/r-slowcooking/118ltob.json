Put it in your cooker and sprinkle with a little garlic powder and salt and pepper.  Add butter to your skillet and sweat some diced onions in there, salt and pepper, and a bit of tomato paste and stir it well to get the onions and paste doing their thing, and then some garlic at the end until you smell it. Add it to the beef.  Get your skillet back on heat and add a cup or two of beef stock with some Worcestershire sauce or a cup of red wine plus a little water and beef bullion.  Scrape up all that fond and add to your cooker.  Put a couple pads of butter on top of the roast.  8 hours on low and done.",

Add salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder,  Italian seasoning and whatever seasoning looks good on both sides of the meat and veggies.  Add a gravy package and substitute the water for chicken or beef broth.  Cook on low for 8 hours. Never had a bad roast using this method. Use leftovers for sandwiches,  even better the next day.",

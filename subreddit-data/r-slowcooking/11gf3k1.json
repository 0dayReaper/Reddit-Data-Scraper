    "postText": "I used to have a 7qt crock pot with just the simple three settings low warm and high and it eventually cracked due to dropping it. I loved it so much\u2026 I needed a new slow cooker immediately and ended up buying a cheaper 7qt Frigidaire\u2026\u2026\n\nI can\u2019t even find this slow cooker online anywhere\u2026I wanted to see if other people are having the same problem that I am\u2026.lately all of my food just seems overcooked or like it cooked too fast\u2026 for example yesterday I cut up a 2.4lb bottom roast and slow cooked beef stew for 6 hours (the seasoning packet suggested 8 hours on low) but due too my knowledge of how my cooker cooks everything too much I only did 6 hours on low and my roast STILL tasted like it cooked way too fast\u2026. Like kinda dry, kinda flavorless, not very tender\u2026\n\nHas anyone else had this issue when working with lesser known name brand slow cookers? Anyway I\u2019m thinking about going back to tried and true crock pot. Any other suggestions????",

    "postText": "I\u2019m making this recipe at the moment:\n\nhttps://www.tamingtwins.com/slow-cooker-doner-kebab/\n\nIt calls for placing what is essentially a seasoned meatloaf into tight foil wrapping and then slow cooking for 4-8 hours (depending on which heat setting you use.) There is NO additional liquid added. \nIs this safe for a slow cooker with a ceramic insert? The recipe states that the juices from the meat will need to be saved from the bottom of the slow cooker but I\u2019ve had this thing going for about 2+ hours on high and don\u2019t have any juices coming out of it yet. I also noticed that both links the author has included to slow cookers that she recommends go to products where the insert can safely go on the stovetop. Mine cannot and I\u2019m getting nervous. Should I abort this mission and throw this thing into the oven instead? TIA",

From what I\u2019ve read though, they\u2019re very close to the same thing: shaved slices of highly spiced meat log turning on a giant spit served on pita with tomatoes, onions, olives and sauce. I gave this a go looking for an at-home gyro night and it did NOT disappoint. Aside from being made with ground beef rather than lamb, this very nicely satisfied our gyro craving. The meat \u201clog\u201d *did* end up producing enough liquid to cover the bottom of the ceramic slow cooker which helped ease my mind. The shop was out of pita so we used naan and piled on all the veg, feta and tatziki sauce. 10/10 will def make again!",

            "comment": "Obligatory \"The Soup\" post.\n\nWe have been enjoying making soup this winter so of course I decided to search reddit for a new soup to make, which lead me to multiple posts about \"The Soup\".  I decided it looked great and needed to make some, and tonight was the night.  We found it to be amazing, thanks.\n\nSome details about my soup:\n\n* I used the recipe found in one of the previous posts which included the following link: [https://www.365daysofcrockpot.com/slow-cooker-tortellini-spinach-soup/](https://www.365daysofcrockpot.com/slow-cooker-tortellini-spinach-soup/)\n* I used precooked Italian sausage instead of chicken (24 ounces)\n* I used 5 cups of tortellini since that was how much was in the bag I bought\n* I was a little liberal in the seasonings I added\n* Per my wife's request we did not add the half-and-half\n* I cooked it in a 5 quart slow cooker and once everything was added, there was zero room for anything else to be added\n\nIt came out amazing.  One of our favorite soups of the winter so far.  Thank you all who posted about this great soup.  Just wanted to make a post to share my experience and thank those who have previously posted about the soup.",

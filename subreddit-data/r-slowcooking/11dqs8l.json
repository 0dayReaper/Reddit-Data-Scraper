Mississippi pot roast is a natural winner because it only requires pre-packaged spice and gravy mixes, a jar of pepperoncinis, some butter, and a nice roast. \n\nAnything barbecue slow cooker is good. Again, just some meat, spice mixes, sauce for when it's done, and some buns or sides to compliment it. \n\nIf your partner can cook ramen, he can cook pasta. Do that tik tok hack where you put a block of feta and cherry tomatoes in the oven, mix with pasta, boom. Easy peasy. \n\nAlso, you can roast baby potatoes, sausage, and onions with maybe some random scattered veggies in the oven for a quick, delicious, and mostly healthy meal. \n\nLots of options. I sometimes avoid chopping things out of sheer laziness. All of these work when you aren't able to bring out a knife.",

Serve as taco filling, burrito filling, quesadillas, pulled pork sandwiches, or just a pile of me at on a plate.  This is my easiest I have much more difficult in flavorful recipes if you're interested.  This is my absolutely favorite meat prep.  Once it in the fridge I just go wild with where can I put this?\n\nThe classic roast dinner in the slow cooker has the advantage of being both simple and covers multiple meals. Potatoes, carrots, onions, plus whatever other root vegetable you like with pork,  chicken, or beef over the top.  Use the same spices you use for oven roasting.\n\nChili and all the bean soups are relatively quick and easy.  Pour ingredients in slow cooker, turn to low and walk away for 7 hours.",

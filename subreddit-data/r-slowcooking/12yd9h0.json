They're a great spot to start cooking since you can simply throw in things that sound tasty plus that broth and you'll have a hearty meal that takes maybe 30m to throw together before bed and will be ready to bring to work when you wake up.\n\nPlus it never gets obsolete\u2013as you improve, you'll learn what spices and ingredients you like best in the meat.",

    "postText": "I am looking at slow cooking some Swedish meatballs. I made them before but now I would like to slow cook them.  Still getting the hang of slow cooking.   \n1. Should I brown them first? I know you can fully cook in the slow cooker\n\n2. Best recipe in your opinions for this?\n\n3. I like mushrooms with my Swedish meatballs, should I add them later or at the start?",

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions have become translucent, about 2-3 minutes.\r  \n2. In a large bowl, combine ground beef, ground pork, Bread crumbs, eggs, allspice, nutmeg and cooked onion; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Using a wooden spoon or clean hands, stir until well combined. Roll the mixture into 1 1/4-to-1 1/2-inch meatballs, forming about 24 meatballs.\r  \n3. Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet. Add meatballs, in batches, and cook until all sides are browned, about 4-5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.\r  \n4. To make the gravy, melt butter in the skillet. Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in beef broth and cook, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in sour cream and cream of mushroom soup; season with salt and pepper, to taste.\r  \n5. Stir in meatballs and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through and thickened, about 8-10 minutes.\r  \n6. Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow can this be translated to the slow cooker? I could also add mushrooms.",

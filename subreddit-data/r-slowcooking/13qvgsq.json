            "comment": "Dal has three components: the dal itself (lentils, peas, beans etc.), the vegetable and the tempering.\n \nBasic dal: Rinse dal of your choice. I use toor dal (split pigeon peas) or moong dal (split green gram) or a combination of both. Add water 1:3 ratio, salt, a pinch of turmeric and slow cook for 4-6hrs on low. Cooking low and slow prevents and gastro issues common with beans and peas. \n\nThe vegetable: This part is optional but highly recommended for nutrition and taste. Commonly used vegetables in my culture are tomatoes, diced onions, cabbage, leafy greens (spinach, fenugreek, chard etc.), lemon drop melon etc. I\u2019ve learnt that any squash works really well too. Peel and roughly chop veggies into medium chunks and add to the dal. If you like spice you can also add hot peppers. Leafy greens cook quickly and can be added at the very end in the last 15-30mins. \n\nThe final step, tadka/tempering: The most important part. You might have to hit up your local Indian grocery store for the ingredients but it\u2019s so worth it. In a small, deep pan heat up oil or ghee. Add whole skin on black mustard seeds (optional), when they splutter add cumin seeds, minced garlic or ginger, curry leaves, dried red chilies, couple of pinches of hing and turn off the stove. Add this to the cooker dal and give it a good stir. Garnish with chop cilantro if you have some on hand.",

You got to smoke it.\n\nWhen it is all done, fire up a small chunk of oak enough that it will smoke and float it in a tinfoil boat and cover the pot and let it smoke.  When its done smoking, stir up the dal, give it a taste and if you don't detect the smokiness yet, fire it up again.",

            "comment": "This is a recipe I made after years of experimenting\n\nGajar Daal with Tadka\nIngredients\n\tDaal:\n2 Cups Split Red Lentils (soaked overnight)\n150 g grated carrot (or approx 2 medium carrots)\n5 Cups Water, or 2-3 inches of water above pan\n4 Roman tomatoes quartered lengthwise\n4 Green Chillies-  deseeded and de-membraned, or 2 green chillies left whole if you don\u2019t mind the extra spice\n1 Asian Bay Leaf\n1 Tsp Salt\n1 Tsp msg, or \u00bd cup chicken stock\n\nTadka (caramelized topping)\n\n\u00bc Cup vegetable oil \n*Tip: Or a mix of mustard oil and ghee for more flavor, at the cost of your health \n1 Tbsp Cumin Seeds\n1 Tsp black mustard seeds\n4 Dried Thai Chillies\n450-500g Yellow Onion\n (optional) 2 cloves of garlic, sliced thinly\n2 tbsp ginger garlic paste\n2 Additional Green Chillies, deseeded, demembranded\n1.5 Tsp Coriander Powder\n1 Tsp Turmeric\n1 Tsp chilli powder\n2 Tsps Paprika\n1 tsp salt\nCilantro for garnish. (for extra flavor, save the stalks for the end)\n\nMethod\nSoak the lentils overnight. Bring 8 cups of water to boil, add daal, carrot, tomatoes, green chilli, Bay Leaf and chicken stock (if you\u2019re not using msg). Bring to a boil, then turn heat down to low. Cover for 1 hour. \nTip 1: You don\u2019t have to adjust the water quantities if adding Chicken stock, because at the end, you\u2019ll boil off the excess water to your desired consistency and it\u2019ll all be mush.\nTip 2: Save the salt and msg for the half-way point because adding it too early will make it take forever to cook/reach the right consistency \nTo make the tadka, you need a wide pan for good caramelization. Add oil to the pan and heat on med-high. Add Cumin and mustard seeds, and fry for 30 seconds. Add dry red chillies, fry for an additional 30-60 seconds- do not burn the spices.\nAdd onion and turn heat up to high. Stir well and fry for 5-10 minutes.\nWhen the onion begins to caramelize (dark blond), add the garlic cloves (and fry for 2-3 minutes). Then add the garlic ginger paste and green chillies. Stir well, let sit, then stir well. Add a splash of water here and there to prevent the spices from burning.\nCheck on the Daal after 30 min; remove lid, stir daal, and add the salt + msg. You can leave the lid off and turn the heat up and start to reduce the daal while you finish up the tadka at this point, but if you\u2019re making a curry simultaneously, you can bring it to a simmer, and put it on low again, and cover it for another 2 hours. \nReduce heat to med-high, When the onions get about almond color, Add the coriander powder, turmeric, chilli powder, paprika and salt. Fry for a few minutes until the mixture is a dark reddish brown color. Remove from heat.\nAfter the 1 hour for the Daal is up, Add the tadka &amp; stir it in. Add the optional celery stalks. Adjust to the desired consistency by boiling off water or adding water (or base sauce or chicken stock- it\u2019ll be delicious no matter what, it\u2019s very forgiving). I typically boil off the water until it resembles a thin porridge. This may take 10-15 min. Adjust for salt.  \nTurn off the head and stir in Cilantro for garnish.",

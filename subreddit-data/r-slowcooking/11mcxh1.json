I just put 2 \\~2lb pieces of pork butt in the slow cooker on low for 7 hours and the temp is barely over 160, so not even close.   \n\n\nAnyone else had this issue? What might I be doing wrong?",

                            "comment": "Well, for perspective I'll tell you what I usually do for pulled pork. I'd I have a hunk of shoulder, at max I'd do 2lb in my 6qt cooker. I would definitely add a cup of water or maybe some kind of stock - chicken usually but beef would work just the same. Unless I have like all day to do it, I'd probably just put it on high for like 6 hours.  At that point it usually just falls apart.\n\nWhat I've been doing recently though is buying boneless country style ribs, again usually 2-4lb at most and adding the same liquid to it. It is reliably shreddable in 6 hours on high and pretty much ready to go at that point. Shoulder is nice but in most cases you really need to smoke it on a typical low temp for a smoker for like 10+ hours to get your expected result. If big hunks of meat is all you have to work with, don't be afraid to chunk it up even smaller.",

Cook low 8 hours and it always comes out juicy and starts shredding just by lifting it out of the liquid.",

            "comment": "Pulled pork is ready to shred when the connective tissue (collagen) has melted into gelatin.  Collagen is what makes a cut of meat like pork butt tough.\n\nTo melt collagen, you need to raise the internal temperature to 170F, and hold it there for as long as it takes for the collagen to melt.  A higher temperature won't make collagen melt faster.\n\nIn practice, it often happens that by the time a pulled pork reaches 195-205, that will mean that the interior was above 170F long enough for the collagen to have melted, but it depends on how fast it got there.  Too fast and the collagen won't have had enough time to melt.  Sometimes your mileage may vary, so feel free to make adjustments as needed.  If you're not getting over 160, add more heat. Feel free to switch to high for a while if that's what it takes.  Once the interior temperature reaches 170F you can reduce the heat so that it doesn't overshoot too much.\n\nCarefully tweaking the heat to adjust the internal temperature is a pain in the neck, so once you've figured out something that works for you, feel free to stick with it rather than trying to optimize it further.  For me that means putting it in a slow cooker that will bring it up to 190F-200F and just letting it sit in there for as long as it takes.  Sometimes that's 16 hours depending on the size.",

There is enough juice and fat that it will be half submerged by the time it is done.  Usually about 8-10 hours on low.  At that point you should be able to use a pair of tongs and pull the bone out clean.",

If after 7 hours, your pork is only at 160\u00b0F, it's not ready yet. To make sure your pork is cooked safely and to the right temperature, you can use a meat thermometer like Chefstemp. This will ensure your pork is cooked to perfection without risking food poisoning.",

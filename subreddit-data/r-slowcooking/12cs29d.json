            "comment": "This is my version of a soup my dad used to make. \n\nChorizo &amp; pancetta fried in a decent amount of oil til crispy.\nChopped and in the slow cooker - 3 onions, 1 red pepper, 8 big tomatoes, all the cured sausage you can find! I used about 8 kabanos, 4 peperamis, 1 v big peppered French sausage and a pack of some kind of polish sausage. \nAdded about 3/4 pint of beef stock, generous amounts of garlic granules, smoked paprika, cayenne, cumin and chilli flakes. \nHigh for 3 hours,  turned down then added a punnet of halved mini plum tomatoes, a tin of chopped tomatoes and half a tube of tomato puree. Seasoned with salt, pepper, Henderson relish and msg\n\nI'm sure it would be better with some beans in there",

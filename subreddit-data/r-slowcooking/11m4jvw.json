    "postText": "Hey everyone\n\nGot a large corned beef on sale at Costco.  Made recipes in the past which turned out okay.  Would like to try a new recipe or read about how you enhance your corned beef in the slow cooker.  \n\nExample: sub in dark beer for water.  Red potatoes best for longer cooking, etc.  \n\nThanks much!",

It's soooo good!\n\nRinse &amp; dry roast, coat in mustard (I use horseradish mustard), add seasoning packet, line insert w celery to make a rack, place roast on top. Cover and seal insert w foil. Cook on high 3-4 hrs or until tender. Do not add liquid, it will make its own.\n\nSqueeze honey onto fat cap, broil until crisp.",

We have found we like even more (like 3x as much molasses, make sure to pour it over the fatty part too.  I don't cook any vegetables with it.",

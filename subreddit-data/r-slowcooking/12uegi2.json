But I use tons of garlic, onions, celery, carrots, potatoes, tomato paste and I deglaze the pan I browned the meet in with Cab Sauv and added that to the beef stock. For pot roast I typically make it in the oven, I tend to like it a bit more in there.",

            "comment": "Yes, you can use bottom round roast for Mississippi Pot Roast. Bottom round roast is a lean cut of beef that comes from the hindquarters of the cow, and it is a good choice for slow cooking because it becomes tender and flavorful when cooked low and slow.\n\nTo make Mississippi Pot Roast with bottom round roast, you will need the following ingredients:\n\n- 3-4 pound bottom round roast\n- 1 packet ranch dressing mix\n- 1 packet au jus gravy mix\n- 6-8 pepperoncini peppers\n- 1/2 cup butter\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Place the bottom round roast in your slow cooker.\n\n2. Sprinkle the ranch dressing mix and au jus gravy mix over the top of the roast.\n\n3. Add the pepperoncini peppers to the slow cooker, placing them around the roast.\n\n4. Place the butter on top of the roast.\n\n5. Cover the slow cooker and cook on low for 8-10 hours or on high for 4-5 hours, or until the roast is tender and falls apart easily.\n\n6. Remove the roast from the slow cooker and shred it using two forks.\n\n7. Serve the shredded roast with the sauce from the slow cooker.",

                            "comment": "\n\nIt is generally recommended to add some liquid when using lean cuts of meat in a slow cooker to prevent the meat from drying out. In the case of bottom round roast, which is a lean cut, you can add some beef broth or water to the slow cooker along with the other ingredients to ensure that the meat stays moist and tender during the cooking process. The amount of liquid you need to add will depend on the size of your slow cooker and the amount of meat you are using, but a general rule of thumb is to add enough liquid to cover about 1/3 to 1/2 of the meat.",

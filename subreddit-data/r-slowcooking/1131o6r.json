            "comment": "Some top brands might be Nesco, Rival (the original Crock Pot), and Cuisinart. But for a basic manual slow cooker (three control settings: Off, Low, and High) just about every appliance maker has one and it's hard to go wrong. You can also check the used market on eBay, Facebook Marketplace, and thrift stores. \n\nAs you add features the price goes up, naturally. But except for the new all-in-ones like the Smart Pot that combines pressure cooker and slow cooker, they all make the same recipes. Your chili won't taste any different whether you make with your grandmother's hand-me-down 1970s Crock Pot, or an expensive Cuisinart with all the programable bells and whistles that connects to a smartphone app. \n\nHere is my list of helpful features to consider paying a little more for.\n\n* Removable crock - some inexpensive units have the actual crockery attached to the cooker; it is not removable. I avoid these. It is easier to serve the food and easier to clean if you can just take the dirty crock out an put it in the sink. \n* Timer - more higher end devices will have the smarts to set a time for the cooker to turn on. This is nice for things like beans and oatmeal that can soak for a while before the cooking starts.\n* Programmable - This is the previous feature on steroids. You can set a start and a stop time. Some of the more sophisticated units will let you start on High, and then at a designated time switch to Low, and then finish on Warm. \n* App - again, a big step up that builds on the previous feature. Allows you to change the settings while you are away, at work for example. It also makes it easier to use the programable features.\n* Straps to clamp on the lid - If you take food to share at a party or pot luck, this keeps the pot roast from spilling in the car.\n* Combine Slow and Pressure Cooking - Smart Pot pioneered this new category of appliance. Obviously its more expensive, but you are getting two appliances in one. \n\nAgain - you don't *need* any of these features to cook. And if you are getting started, there is a good argument to be made to start with a basic (or even used) model and see how you like it before spending a lot of money on fancy features.",

Cook a lot of meat, you might want one with a temp probe that can maintain a specific temperature, want to make homemade yogurt or cook things very precisely, a temp probe and a timer are good to have.\n\nSlow cookers are basic devices, not a lot to them, so almost any decent company is going to have a decent slow cooker, I'd recommend buying on the features/price rather than brand.  Cheap ones tend to do just fine though in my experience.",

You can go cheaper and get one with a ceramic pot but if you expose that pot to direct heat from the hob it will crack.  You don\u2019t have to brown at all but if you do it adds colour and flavour.",

If I'm going to cook something on high it's usually 3-4 hours. Low is usually between 7-9 hours.\n\nHowever this is more of a roaster. So if I want to slow cook something for 8 hours or so, what would be the best temperature to set it at? Or if I wanted to do short ribs or a chuck roast in 4 hours? Are there temperature settings that you would normally use in place of the high and low settings on a crock pot?\n\nThanks again for all your help. Looking forward to trying this.",

This works much better in their house as people are out a lot.\n\nI have a \u00a320 one from Sainsbury's, it is either off, warm, low or high. This is fine for me as I work from home so can turn it on and off as needed. \n\nSo I think maybe think about your lifestyle and what you are going to use it for. I would never buy an expensive one tho, even my parents one was still relatively cheap. Lakeland do ones with meat thermometers attached and all sorts but I don't really see the point to that.",

I do a very simple buttermilk brine. \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n1 (4- 5 lb) whole chicken, 5 cloves smashed garlic, 1 (0.5 oz) pkg Roasting Blend (McCormick or Nature\u2019s Promise), 2 cups low-fat buttermilk, 1 tbsp olive oil\n\n**Steps**\n1. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper. Add the chicken, garlic, and roasting blend to a 1 gal freezer bag. Stand the bag up and carefully add the buttermilk. Seal bag well. Place on a large plate and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 48 hours.\n\n2. Remove the chicken from bag and discard brine. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Place chicken in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet. Let stand at room temperature 20 min. Rub chicken all over with the oil and season with salt and pepper.\n\n3. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Roast chicken 1 hour, rotating skillet halfway through, until a meat thermometer inserted in the thigh reaches 165\u00b0F. If chicken browns too quickly, cover with foil.",

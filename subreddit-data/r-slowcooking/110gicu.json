    "postText": "I have a small kitchen with my partner, we currently have a russel hobbs rice cooker and I want to do slow cook meals so I don't have to do everything when I get back... \n\nThe stupid question is - can I use my rice cooker as a slow cooker for a period of 8 hours? I assume not bc there won't be enough liquid and it's nit adjustable in temperature. If I leave my rice for long enough it becomes a rice cake.\n\nI just don't really have the cupboard/counter space rn for a slow cooker, but I also know it'll do me a world of good.",

            "comment": "You can't. But if space is hard to find, you could swap the rice cooker for an Instant Pot (that's a brand name, there are plenty of appliances like that). The Instant Pot can be a rice cooker, slow cooker, pressure cooker, and (probably) more depending on how you set it. They're not very expensive (probably not much more than a rice cooker). Time to go shopping!",

I\u2019ve had to dump my meal into a pot on the stove to get chicken to temperature, it seems to have too many settings for slow cooking and i quickly gave up on it and went back to my slow cooker.",

And my beans cooked at that temp after all was said and done for 9 hours. From what I have learned here, be sure to soak your beans overnight and toss the water before cooking in the crockpot.

Heat does break down the toxin, but slow cookers may not get to that temperature. \n\nIt won't kill you, but you might not have a fun night if you ate too much depending on how many beans were used, how hot it gets, for how long it cooks, etc.",

Things like the broth, seasoning mix, beans can be done ahead of time. In one go it's about 12 hours but can be broken down by sections and done ahead of time and stored until wanting to make it. Hope that helps and if you have questions, feel free to ask!",

They contain toxins that can cause diarrhea and vomiting if not cooked properly.\n\nOP, you should mention this in your comment about the recipe so people don\u2019t get sick.\n\nSoaking red kidney beans (especially lentils and chickpeas) in water is a must. Even the water you soak them in can cause issues. It only takes a couple beans to cause serious problems. Preparing beans properly will keep you healthy and reduces the risk of complications.\n\nhttps://www.allrecipes.com/article/kidney-beans-slow-cooker/ \u201cwhy you should never cook kidney beans in a slow cooker\u201d\n\nhttps://www.foodsafetynews.com/2021/05/how-to-avoid-poisoning-from-red-beans/#:~:text=Eating%20raw%20or%20undercooked%20kidney,many%20plants%2C%20animals%20and%20humans.\n\nHow to avoid food poisoning from red beans:\n\n\u201cCooking your own beans is a great way to save money, reduce waste and lower your sodium consumption, but eating improperly cooked beans can lead to serious illness. This is especially true for kidney beans.\n\nEating raw or undercooked kidney beans can lead to food poisoning, including symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Only a few beans are needed to cause poisoning.\n\nKidney beans, or red beans, contain a natural protein, Lectin, that is found in many plants, animals and humans. However, at high levels, like that found in raw or undercooked kidney beans, the protein can act as a toxin.\n\nHow to properly cook kidney beans and destroy toxins \n\nBeans should be soaked in water for at least five hours.\n\nSoaking water should be dumped, and the beans should be boiled in fresh water for at least 30 minutes.\n\nDo not use a slow cooker. Slow cookers do not get hot enough to destroy the toxins in kidney beans.\u201d",

I am in love with my Hamilton Beach 6 qt oval \"set it and forget it\" programmable slow cooker. It has low, medium, and high temperature settings (most have just low and high). You can program for the cooking to keep the contents warm after it stops cooking so the meat doesn't go bad should you be late turning it off. Or you can program it to continue cooking for an additional up to 4 hours after your initial stop time. I swear by mine and use it almost continuously. I HIGHLY recommend a Hamilton Beach. 6-qt ones start around $40-50; programmables start around $70. They're worth a splurge.",

The issue with slow cookers is they are slow, so spending all that time cooking a little food seems inefficient.

Some instant pots / ninja foodis offer that now. \n\nMaybe some folk will get different appliances... My kitchen countertop space is kinda limited. It's not even that small a kitchen, I just have so much other shit too.",

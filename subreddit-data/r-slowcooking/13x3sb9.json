Add enough water to cover. Cook on low for eight hours. Add fresh shrimp in the top for the last thirty minutes.\n\nServe on rice.",

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76JXtB7JFQY) shows how you make it in a Dutch oven, I start the recipe in one then for the 'burbling' part I tip it into a slow cooker and leave it. The longest I've let it go is 18 hours, I use bone-in skin on chicken thighs and it's amazing. Being in the UK I can't get Andouille, so use Kielbasa instead and I also brown that off.\n\nMaking the dark roux is a crucial part that you definitely should not skip! It's absolutely worth the effort of the prep time, and not just using the slow cooker from cold.",

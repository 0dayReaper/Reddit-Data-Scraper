                    "comment": "I do baby back pork ribs trimmed and back membrane removed but i like mine pretty fatty i season very generously front and back with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, smoked paprika, beef bouillon, chili powder, and cayenne. I then chop it up every 3-5 ribs but try to keep them even lengths and I take about a bulb of garlic like at least 10 cloves and chop it up and slivered onions. I usually use 2 crockpots for 2 full racks of ribs but for the barbecue sauce I do all the same seasonings, baby Ray\u2019s, raw garlic, brown sugar, and Worcestershire. I then do it in a layer of ribs, barbecue sauce, garlic, and onion between each stack of ribs and whatever extra i just add it to each pot till it\u2019s gone. I usually do it on high and rotate every so often to keep them cooking the same usually leaving smaller pieces on the top. I\u2019m not sure how long but I\u2019d say high for at least 5 hours+. When they start to pretty much fall apart i put them on low broil in the oven for a little bit with more barbecue and juices on top. \nFor the scalloped potatoes I use golden or russet i don\u2019t really have a preference just Golden cooks a bit better and cut them pretty thin just not see through and cut more about 2-3 cloves of garlic and onion slivers. I do pretty much an Alfredo sauce but add choices of cheese just make sure not to add too much or it will make it really oily when cooked and be too thick when cooking. So I\u2019ll do about 2 tablespoons of butter, add garlic, add about 2 tablespoons of flour, add 2 cups of heavy cream, then whatever cheese and seasonings. For my seasonings i did garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and chicken bouillon. I then add the potatoes to a rather large dish and do potatoes, onions,sauce, and cheese and repeat till done. Then i add it to the oven at like 350 for like 25-30 mins or just until done. And to get a crispy top i broil for a little bit. I hope this makes sense i honestly never use recipes and was never taught how to cook so I\u2019m not sure how much exactly of everything i used. \ud83d\ude1e",

I will have to try these dishes sometime. \n\nSome of the stuff that I make also does not have recipes, either. The bad thing about that for me is that sometimes I forget what all I put in it the last time, and just wing it the next time and hope it comes out similar. Lol",

I then do it in a layer of ribs, barbecue sauce, garlic, and onion between each stack of ribs and whatever extra i just add it to each pot till it\u2019s gone. I usually do it on high and rotate every so often to keep them cooking the same usually leaving smaller pieces on the top. I\u2019m not sure how long but I\u2019d say high for at least 5 hours+. When they start to pretty much fall apart i put them on low broil in the oven for a little bit with more barbecue and juices on top. \nFor the scalloped potatoes I use golden or russet i don\u2019t really have a preference just Golden cooks a bit better and cut them pretty thin just not see through and cut more about 2-3 cloves of garlic and onion slivers. I do pretty much an Alfredo sauce but add choices of cheese just make sure not to add too much or it will make it really oily when cooked and be too thick when cooking. So I\u2019ll do about 2 tablespoons of butter, add garlic, add about 2 tablespoons of flour, add 2 cups of heavy cream, then whatever cheese and seasonings. For my seasonings i did garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and chicken bouillon. I then add the potatoes to a rather large dish and do potatoes, sauce, and cheese and repeat till done. Then i add it to the oven at like 350 for like 25-30 mins or just until done. And to get a crispy top i broil for a little bit. I hope this makes sense i honestly never use recipes and was never taught how to cook so I\u2019m not sure how much exactly of everything i used. \ud83d\ude1e",

I then chop it up every 3-5 ribs but try to keep them even lengths and I take about a bulb of garlic like at least 10 cloves and chop it up and slivered onions. I usually use 2 crockpots for 2 full racks of ribs but for the barbecue sauce I do all the same seasonings, baby Ray\u2019s, raw garlic, brown sugar, and Worcestershire.

    "postText": "I get it. Mississippi pot roast is good. The soup is good. But is posting the 15th picture of it really contributing anything to this sub?\n\nI come here for new recipes- the \u201cI made it too!\u201d posts just seem low-effort and decrease the quality and usefulness of the sub.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m in the minority here- what do you all think?\n\nEdits: Okay, so this got way more responses than I expected. I may reply to the occasional comment here and there but wanted to address the most common comments I got.\n\n1. \"Why don't you just post OC instead of bitching?\"\n\nWell, I frankly don't use my crock pot that often, as I usually cook meals in real time. \n\n2. \"Why don't you just google recipes instead of whining?\"\n\nAt this point, what is the purpose of the sub? Do we as a community want recipes and tips, or just pretty pictures?\n\n3. \"I like it because it means it's probably a good recipe\"\n\nI can get on board with this response to a degree- however, isn't that what upvotes are for? I suggest some effort from the mod team here to do things like other subs such as stickied threads for a certain recipe, etc.\n\n4. \"Slow cooking is for people who like crap food and don't know how to cook\"\n\nWhy are you here?\n\n5. \"I made XYZ recipe with my crockpot!\" \n\nGreat- you're not part of the issue here....\n\n6. \"Just keep scrolling/hide those posts/same with other subs/etc\"\n\nDo we honestly not want to make things better?\n\n7. \"Just Unsub you pompous ass/nobody is going to miss you/why do people bitch about unsubbing\"\n\nI didn't threaten to unsub. I asked a question. I asked for the community's thoughts. Given it's the highest rated post in almost a month and tops most of the \"I made it too\" posts, I think the community has spoken. I may or may not unsub some day, but that's not what this post was about.\n\nMods: care to chime in?",

            "comment": "It is wonderful to see such spirited discussion of slow cooking recipes. This is a wonderful community, and I am continually amazed with the creativity and thoughtfulness that goes into original recipes submitted here. Thank you all for your positive contributions. \n\nIf you check out the sidebar, we moderators have created a number of rules, in addition to the reddit-wide rules to enable a civil and constructive discussion of slow cooking. The tools we have available to enforce these rules are friendly reminders, and we are able to remove posts, comments, and users.\n\nPlease use the report button for posts and comments you believe violate one of the rules. This brings that post or comment to our attention. If it does not violate a rule, you do not need to submit a report. \n\nAfter careful consideration, it is not appropriate to add more rules at this time. I can\u2019t even think of a rule that could be fairly and evenly applied that might address this particular complaint.\n\nThe good news is, reddit was built around a solution to this issue. Upvote original, creative, and new things you think are worthy of more attention. Downvote posts you think are unoriginal or low-effort. Over time, things will work out.",

If I am gonna make a pot roast...I am gonna make a proper pot roast. As I was preping it I was like...how is this going to be good? It was not. \n\nSave your roast and find a good recipe that will be just as easy and you will be much happier with.\n\nHere is one:\n\ncube some potatoes and carrots and onions and throw them in the slowcooker. pour in a cup of broth or stock. rub your beef roast with salt and pepper. put it in the slowcooker on top of the veggies. 4 on high or 8 on low. \n\nthis is the most basic recipe possible and it will give you a better meal than that abortion that is the mississippi pot roast (I am convinced people just like typing mississippi)",

Braised pork cheeks (or shoulder if you can't find cheeks), braised short ribs, braised poultry dishes, etc. But braising, while perfectly fine to finish in the slow cooker, does require steps before that point. You do need to sear, saute, and deglaze before you dump it into the slow cooker.\n\nSo I've never felt like it would go over well here.",

And then when you take an after-cooking picture, just shove the camera into the crockpot. And don't forget to take 20 other pictures from slightly different angles so you can repost it for a year with a new title.\n\nFor real I don't care about how you successfully did a crockpot recipe - You don't exactly have to be Gordon Ramsey here to be able to throw a bunch of crap in a bucket, set it to *one of three settings* for 8 hours, and not have it come out as a gelatinous pile of garbage.\n\nBut if you do something neat with it, change up the recipe, by all means, post that! As long as it's not \"I replaced the spinach with kale!\", because goddamn enough already.",

A recipe gets popular and everyone posts a picture of when they make it.  Then these \"I'm so sick of seeing X\" threads come out.  Then somebody makes the exact thing I'm writing right now in a text post.  Then we forget about that recipe and move on to the next one.  The circle of slowcooking life.",

My curry just never comes out right(too soupy because it requires a lot of liquid), I prefer making chilli on the stove top, and that doesn't love much else that I'm aware of.  \n\nBTW I say this not as a vegetarian(I love eating meat), but as someone married to a vegetarian who does all the cooking!",

Just because something is redundant or unnecessary to you, doesn't mean that that's the case for every user. Having a new user or first-time poster submit the 10,000th chili photo might seem unnecessary but to that new poster that's proud to share their creation, it can mean the difference between longterm subreddit engagement or feeling rejected because their post wasn't original enough for somebody.\n\nThere's also a 'Hide' button below every post on every subreddit. If you really don't want to see a post, then just hide it instead of submitting the 1000th complaint post (which in and of itself is an unoriginal, unproductive, and unnecessary post).\n\nSo I implore users to keep posting your chili and pot roast photos all you want, I won't mind. And if people give you flack, just know that I believe they're just some grizzled user that thinks everything that's submitted is intended for them.",

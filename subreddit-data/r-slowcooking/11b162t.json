    "postText": "\nI started a batch of bone broth last night. It had beef shanks and marrow bones, a cup of ACV, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, a sprig of rosemary. I turned the heat off at 9am this morning to let it cool and sift all the stuff out, then put the bones back in to cook on low for another 24 hours. It is now 1pm and I just realized I forgot to plug my crock pot back in. It was 105\u00b0F. Could I just put it on high a couple hours and then low for the remaining 24 hours? Or should I toss it? I feel so stupid right now.",

I certainly wasn't suggesting she add salt to supersaturation just as the joking regarding adding ethanol and boiling it off here were hopefully joking on both ends. \n\nYou're dead wrong on the denaturation and thus deactivation of toxins with heat. Many toxins of concern do break down at temps achievable at home. Botulinum is the most serious as it is the most deadly.  In ye olden days folks would boil their canned goods (especially non acidic like green beans)  for 20 minutes as that would reliably denature botulinum (this wasn't a great idea but just in case canning hadn't been as reliably as hoped for...it was a backup).  Yes 121 C is the target (for 3 minutes plus) for spores in canning. Most medical gear is no longer heat autoclaved but when I did in the microbiology lab we achieved temps and pressures far higher.  Other bacterial toxins responsible for food poisoning are denatured irreversibly or reversibly (sadly) at various temperatures.  This is also pH dependent and of course I wasn't suggesting she add vinegar (notably also used as a preservative/inhibitor).  Some are lower than 100C including botulinum.  If you need citations I'll find them for you.  \n\nSorry for pissing match OP....and hope your broth was ok.  Edited some spelling and clarity.",

BS in Biology (got a full scholarship to a Land Grant University for undergraduate Chem Engineering so great field but I was shooting higher.) Then also my MD degree and 30+ years of experience.  Oh didn't have to get a MS to get into Medical School.  \n\nI'm not even sure you're reading comprehension skills are that great (would explain stopping at the MS as those MCATs and GMAT require some reading comprehension) as I didn't suggest \"Hell if you boil anything it'll be fine\".

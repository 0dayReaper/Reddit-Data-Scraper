            "comment": "I feel like doing a whole chicken in a slow cooker really doesn't make any sense. Sure, it can be done but from a practical standpoint it just doesn't really get you anywhere. I'd probably just halve it and cook half of it. I totally get why having something cook for 8 hours while your away is ideal but like at the same time roasting a 2 or 3 lb bird in the oven isn't going to take that long. For the effort, you can get a whole rotisserie chicken already done at the supermarket for maybe $5 more than what you're gonna pay for it raw.",

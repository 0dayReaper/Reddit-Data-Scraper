Or cut up some yellow potatoes and add that in the last two hours. \n\nIf not, tastes good by itself too or over rice.",

Cook on low for about 8 hours.",

Load in the ribs, fill the crock with a couple bottles of decent red wine and go 10 hours on low. Strain out the juice, chill to gather the fat. Then reduce to sauce thickness, season, add butter, serve over mashed taters or polenta.",

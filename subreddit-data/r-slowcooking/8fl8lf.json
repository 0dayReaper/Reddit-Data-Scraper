You really have a lot of control over how spicy you like your queso. I\u2019ve added a few drops of death sauce before and it was fire. You can also fresh cut tomato, onion and other stuff you like in it. In a pinch I use the container of fresh salsa to save time. The milk helps keep the dip from hardening and really gives it a nice consistency. Add the sausage when it\u2019s cooked and you\u2019re done. \n\nIt won\u2019t last at a party. ",

Once it's heated and mixed, the juice from the Rotel will keep it from hardening, and the Velveeta already has the perfect consistency. \n\nCube Velveeta, pour in Rotel and heat, stirring occasionally. It's hard to get any easier than that.\n\nIt's also nice to serve veggie sticks in addition to chips, like just strips/slices of sweet/mild onion or red bell pepper (one of my personal faves).",

Mix about 14 grams (about 3 teaspoons) of the stuff to half a bottle of beer, bring to a boil, mix in about a pound of any freshly shredded cheese, and then blend with an emulsion blender. \n\nBam, perfect cheese sauce. \n\nThe last time I did this, I did exactly what I said above, and added 1 pound of taco spiced beef and a can of Rotel, and it vanished quickly. \n\nLet me be clear: I have no problems with Velveeta, it's great. That said, this stuff allows you to get Velveeta like melt out of ANY cheese you want, or any mixture of cheeses, and that's awesome.",

I brown some taco meat, and add a can of refried beans. I will normally add a few drops of franks red hot, for the tiniest bite, and it's good to go. \n\nI'll either make some overtoasted quesadillas with the queso dip as the insides, or we just use some hearty AF corn chips, either some nice gold ones or frito scoops. Personally, I like using chili cheese fritos myself, but they don't make a chili cheese frito scoop(frito lay *bastards*). \n\nI will normally add a lil milk, and a couple drops of water here and there until i get the consistency I want. Also, goes fucking *GREAT* on hotdogs, almost like a super chili cheese dog. \n\nI've been considering adding a very mild salsa(I have Crohn's disease so spicy is no go) but normally when I get salsa, I get the cheapo blended tomato sauce kind, not the chunky squares of tomato kind. \n\nIdk I need an excuse to make me a bit pot again. Looks like I gotta involve myself with a family outing soon.",

While stirring occasionally, cook until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook\nfor 30 more seconds.\n\n\nAdd the ground beef to the skillet, along with the cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Stir until\neverything is well combined and then cook the ground beef for 15 more minutes, or until browned. Taste and\nadjust seasonings. Turn off the heat and drain any excess grease.\nMeanwhile, to make the guacamole, mash together the avocado, lime juice, and cilantro. Add salt to taste.\nTo make the queso, in a saucepot heat the oil on medium-low heat and add the jalape\u00f1o and onion. While stirring\noccasionally, cook until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 more seconds.\nLeaving on the heat, stir in the cumin, black pepper, and cornstarch until the dry ingredients are well combined\nwith the vegetables. Pour in the chicken broth and while stirring cook until the sauce has thickened, which\nshould happen in a couple of minutes.\n\n\nTurn the heat down to low and working in batches, slowly stir in a handful of the cheese. After it\u2019s melted into\nthe sauce, repeat the process until all the cheese is added. Stir in the tomatoes, adjust seasonings, and add salt to\ntaste.\n\n\nThis makes a lot of queso, so you can either serve it in individual bowls or in a larger dish, such as a 9-inch\nsquare dish. To assemble, layer along the bottom of the dish the taco meat, then pour in the queso and then top\nwith the guacamole and sour cream. Serve warm with chips.",

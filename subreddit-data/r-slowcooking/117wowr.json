Kidney beans are toxic unless they are cooked to a certain temp.  And \u201ccooked\u201d isn\u2019t everything- do you care if they split apart?  Do want them to be tender? Etc. Best practice is to soak them for a couple hours in salted water with a teaspoon of baking soda, rinse them, and soak them in the fridge overnight.",

Please stop spreading lies.\n\nYou only have to pre cook dried kidney beans, and then for about 10 minutes.\n\nThis is why it's the only bean I buy canned. I'm lazy. \n\nI don't precook or soak my dried. Most weeks in summer I batch cook dried chickpeas for hummus or  grain salad for the work week.\n\nI take about a cup of dried beans I rinsed and sorted* \nThrow them in my little crockpot and cook on high for two hours. They always come out perfect. If I know all of them are for hummus, I'll put in a out 1/2 to 1 tsp of baking soda which deskins them so my hummus is more creamy, but that's \"company is coming\" hummus. I don't normally do this for just me as the extra smooth result is not worth the pain in the  tuckus picking the skins out deal.",

From the Bad Bug Book by the FDA:\n\nPhytohaemagglutinin (kidney bean lectin) \r\n1. Protein / Toxin \r\nLectins are widely occurring, sugar-binding \r\nproteins that perform a variety of biological \r\nfunctions in plants and animals, including humans, \r\nbut some of them may become toxic at high \r\nlevels. Besides inducing mitosis, lectins are \r\nknown for their ability to agglutinate many \r\nmammalian red blood cell types, alter cell-\r\nmembrane transport systems, alter cell \r\npermeability to proteins, and generally interfere \r\nwith cellular metabolism. \r\nAmong the lectins known to have toxic effects is \r\nphytohaemagglutinin, which occurs at relatively \r\nhigh levels in the seeds of legumes (e.g., beans). \r\nThe role of this compound in defense against plant \r\npests and pathogens has been established. \r\nThis hemagglutinin also is used in research; for \r\nexample, to trigger DNA and RNA synthesis in T \r\nlymphocytes, in vitro. PHAs are used to test \r\ncompetence of cell-mediated immunity; for \r\nexample, in patients with chronic viral infections. \r\n2. Disease \r\nRed kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) poisoning \r\nand kinkoti bean poisoning are examples of names for the illness caused by \r\nphytohaemagglutinin. \r\n\uf0b7\t Mortality: not reported. \r\n\uf0b7\t Toxic dose: As few as four or five raw beans can trigger symptoms. \r\n\uf0b7\t Onset: Usually begins with extreme nausea and vomiting within 1 to 3 hours of \r\ningestion of the product, with diarrhea developing later within that timeframe. \r\n\uf0b7\t Illness / complications: Upper and lower gastrointestinal illness. Vomiting may become \r\nsevere. \r\n\uf0b7\t Symptoms: In addition to vomiting and diarrhea, abdominal pain has been reported by \r\nsome people.",

            "comment": "Better result this time around. This recipe is a variation from my post yesterday in which I've changed to suit my smaller 1.5 litre Slow Cooker. The main difference being - YAY IT DIDN'T BURN! \n\nI'd still like to tweak the low and high times - there's sure room for improvement. Goes to show each slow cooker is different and many recipes online shouldn't be taken too literal.\n\nSo here's my makeshift recipe :\n\nStarted with a herb bowl (pictured)\n\n3 large garlic cloves\n\n3 large parsley stems\n\n\u00bd spice cannister soaked (24 hours) fenugreek\n\n4 tbs basil\n\n4 tbs sage\n\n1 tsp pink himalayan salt grinded\n\n50g mozzarella cheese mixed in and put to one side\n\n1 cup warm water mixed in bowl 1 tsp active yeast left for 10 minutes\n\n1 cup self raising flour added to yeast mix\n\n1 tbs olive oil\n\nPoured in herb bowl and stirred through with a 2nd cup of flour to form dough.\n\nDropped dough into Slow Cooker lined with baking paper that had lower section covered with a coat of margarine.\n\nTowel, lid on and low for 1\u00bd hours, pushed dough down, then a further 30 minutes on high.\n\nSliced, pressed, served grilled with tomato paste, spanish salami, black olives and more mozzarella cheese.",

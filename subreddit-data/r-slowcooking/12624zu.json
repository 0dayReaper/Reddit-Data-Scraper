Two carrots, chopped. Tablespoon whole peppercorns. Handful of fresh thyme (I love thyme so I overdo it). 2 bay leaves. Cover carcass with water, usually about 4 quarts. I cook on high for 24 hours, taste and add salt as needed, strain and let the broth sit for 12-24 hours and then skim the fat layer. After that I either can the broth or freeze it. So good.",

            "comment": "This does require some pre preparation but it is completely worth it.\n\nFirst of all in an airtight container add:\n\n3 tbsp Smoked Sweet Paprika\n4 tbsp Hot Curry powder\n3 tbsp Cumin\n3 tbsp Coriander\n3 tbsp Turmeric\n1 tbsp Garam Masala\n\nYou can prepare these yourself or buy shop bought. There is a flavour difference however shop bought is fine. Once they are in the container put the lid on and shake until well mixed.\n\nWhat you need for this recipe:\n\n500-600 grams of boneless chicken thighs\n500ml coconut cream\n2 medium onions finely diced\n1 red chilli finely diced with seeds left in\n4 cloves of garlic minced\n1 thumb sized piece of ginger peeled and grated.\n2 tablespoons of tomato puree\n1 tbsp balsamic vinegar\n2 tbsp of coconut oil or ghee\n2 tbsp of your preprepared spice mix\n1 cinnamon stick\n2 Bay leaves\nSalt to taste\n\nBefore you put things in the slow cooker the most important step is to bring out the flavours of the aromatics and spices so get a frying pan on a medium heat, add your oil of choice and add your onions, chilli, garlic and ginger stir and scrape so you don't burn anything. When your onions are golden brown add your spice mix.\n\nCook this whilst stirring and scraping for about a minute before adding your tomato puree. Cook for another 1-2 minutes. Add your balsamic vinegar and scrape any residue into the spice mix. Add your chicken to this pan and get it covered in your spice base. Add everything to the slow cooker with the coconut cream, cinnamon stick and Bay leaves.\n\nCook on low for 5-6 hours. \n\nThis recipe is very flexible, it can be upscaled or downscaled. You can add tinned tomatoes or coconut milk instead of cream, add more chillis etc, if it's too runny at the end (this one wasnt) then you can make a cornflour mix to thicken. Goes well with basmati rice and naan.\n\nThe key is your spice mix and this mix can be a gateway to a lot of great tasting curries.\n\nEdit: Sorry about the format, I can Cook, just not format my reddit posts properly apparently.",

It adds some acidity as well in combination with the tomato paste.",

I can't just measure and add when called for?\n\nSort of confused by \"prepare yourself or shop bought\" as well. These are all raw spices, how else do you get them? Do you mean you can buy a premixed pack with all that together vs mixing yourself?",

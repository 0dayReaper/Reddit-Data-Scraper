Put it in while with carrots onions garlic. Season it up well with whatever you fancy. Put a lemon inside it. Then add some white wine to the bottom of the slow cooker. \nWhen it\u2019s done shred the chicken. Then the juice in the slow cooker can be used to make the gravy for the chicken",

            "comment": "A chicken in every pot!\n\nIt depends on what I plan on doing with the leftovers.\n\nTypically I will do just a roast chicken in the oven, with root vegetables and a basic seasoning of salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning. Then a lemon or apple and rosemary or lavender as aromatics. Beer can works great too.\n\nFor the crockpot, it is usually chicken, rice, and cream of chanterelle mushroom soup. If planning ahead, will often brine the chicken first.\n\nOther family favorites are chicken jambalaya.\n\nHowever, from the roast chicken mentioned above, the next steps are to make a crock pot soup; chicken and dumplings. From there, pot pie.\n\nBrining really brings out extra depth. Slow cooking does wonders too.\n\nOnce the chicken is cooked, you can shred the meat and go a lot of different routes, from sliders, buffalo chicken bake, or tacos.\n\nA lot of folks do meal planning, but this is where it stems from; make a good chicken dinner, lending to leftovers for chicken and a biscuit snack, to noodle soup, chicken salad, chicken and dumplings, and many other dishes where shredded or cooked chicken meat can be of use.\n\nHope this has helped get you salivating for some really good home cooked dishes you whip up!",

            "comment": "When I slow cook a whole chicken, I put some cut up onions carrots and celery in the crock-pot first then the chicken on top, I also put some cut up garlic and onions inside of the chicken. I use classic poultry seasonings like sage and thyme, parsley, salt and pepper. I sprinkle the mixture inside and outside of the chicken. Then I always sprinkle some paprika on the top of the chicken, so it looks better when done. strain all the juice into a bowl and make gravy or save it to use another way, it will become gelatinous delicious stock in the frig!",

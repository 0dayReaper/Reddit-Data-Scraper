Be warned, it was a cheap high volume amazon model so I figured it'd be good.\n\nSucks balls.\n\nTimer literally stops randomly.  Ok, screw the timer, I can use the microwave timer. \n\nHeating element sucks, very uneven.  It literally burns/scorches food in specific areas of the pot on low setting.  We're talking like within an hour its got black burn on items. \n\nI am full of regret buying it and considering just trashing it and buying a nicer one.",

Slow cookers are metal so you can take the pan off and sear the meat on the stove first. \nHaving the meat Brown on all sides before you put it in the slow cooker to cook, makes it all taste that much better.\nOther than that they're extremely similar in the way they cook.",

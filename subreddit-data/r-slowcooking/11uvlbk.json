    "postText": "Has anyone had any luck rendering the fat out of guanciale in a slow cooker? My hypothesis is putting 8 oz of guanciale in a crock pot possibly with a 1/3 cup of pasta water and seeing if I can render the fat out without filing my house with smoke. Might add pasta and the cheese egg mixture later if it works for a nice carbonara?",

You cook it on a medium heat until it gets slightly hard and put off to the side until you are ready to add the noodles and sauce The reason for doing this in the pan is because the fat acts like an oil for the noodles. \n\nYou could always bake it but that's not how you make carbonara. You always pan fry.",

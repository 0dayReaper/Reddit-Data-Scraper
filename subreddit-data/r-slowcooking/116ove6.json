I followed almost as is, but instead of simmering on the stove I added it to the slow cooker. I cooked on low for 3 hours, then I added the potatoes and beans and cooked for 30 minutes. Then I added the kale and cooked for another 30 minutes. Then I added the tortellini, switched to warm and let it sit covered until the pasta was cooked through, maybe 10 minutes. \n\nI added carrots and beans because why not. It turned out delicious.",

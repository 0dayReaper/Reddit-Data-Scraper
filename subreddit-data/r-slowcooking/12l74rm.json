            "comment": "This is borderline a Chowder though I couldn't find any Tom Yum Chowder recipes so stuck with a more forgiving title.\n\nIt started early this morning with 2 carrots and a small potato set on high for 2 hours. I was adamant I wouldn't let Garlic dominate so only 2 cloves crushed. \u00bc cup of Red Lentils, about 4 tsp of Paprika, 3 tsp Rosemary and 2 tsp Basil. \n\nVegetables were then removed - carrots were mashed in the Mortar with potato diced into cubes. Some left-over Coriander chopped up, also about 50g of Sliced Ham into squares. Added 3 heaped tbsp of Milk Powder along with 1 can of Tom Yum Tuna.\n\nOverall not a bad breakfast, still quite spicy hot considering it's volume. Would do well with some Sour Cream to top. Have a wonderful day!",

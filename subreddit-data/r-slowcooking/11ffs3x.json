They have all a good selection of kits and some of the best substrates (growing medium) used in the kits. Pro tip If your location isn't particularly humid, a plastic Walmart bag may be used to create a \"humidity tent\"; simply poke a few holes in it and cover the box until you notice tiny mushrooms growing or the \"pinning stage,\" when they first begin to fruit.",

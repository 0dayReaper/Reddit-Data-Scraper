In the bottom of the crockpot, put 3 to 4 Bay leaves.  Place seasoned pork loin on top of the bay leaves.  Pour 1 cup chicken broth around the pork loin ( not on top).  cook on low for 7.5 hours, I flip it over at 4 hour point.  Once done, remove bay leaves, pull and shred, then put back in crockpot for 30 minutes.  Now serve on tortillas as Carnitas or can be put on buns and sauced with your favorite barbecue sauce.",

Put a good sized chuck roast (or whatever roast you prefer, you can also use a pork roast, a bunch of chicken thighs, or a whole chicken) on top of the onions. Dump a bag of baby carrots and a bag of tiny potatoes* (I think mine are 1 pound bags) around the roast. If you like mushrooms, add a small container of whole or halved button or baby bellas in. Garlic salt and pepper again over the top of everything, some paprika if you like, and add a couple good splashes of Worcestershire sauce. Pour in about a cup of water. Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours. \n\n*you can totally use cut up regular carrots and potatoes. Just cut them into relatively equally sized chunks. I use the ready-out-of-the-bag ones for the sake of getting it done quicker.",

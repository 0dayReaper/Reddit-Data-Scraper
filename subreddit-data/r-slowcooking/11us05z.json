To your question, based on the Gatorade names I might try rain berry, then I looked at that weird purple color and thought no. So basically I am still saying no as seeing these I would not purchase. If I was offered a taste I might try them. So sticking to my original statement poor packaging as I still have no clue what the flavor is.",

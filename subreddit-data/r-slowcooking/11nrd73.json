    "postText": "I am making buffalo chicken dip using [this recipe](https://www.thechunkychef.com/slow-cooker-buffalo-chicken-dip-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-12598) and the recipe uses precooked chicken, but I bought chicken thighs to cook in the crockpot. I plan to cook the thighs first since I know adding the cheese and other ingredients will not take as long.\n\nMy question is, would it be better to slow cook them in the buffalo sauce, or just cook them by themselves? Or does it not even matter, and I\u2019m overthinking this whole thing?",

            "comment": "I would cook by itself and then drain it because I would think it would be too runny and take the sauciness away from it if cooked together. Then put back in slow cooker and cook longer with the sauce. That's just my two cents.",

I think that browning gives a lot of addl flavor.\n\nIf you transfer to the crockpot and can get that fond off the skillet, or even just use the skillet for the rest of the ingredients, all the better.",

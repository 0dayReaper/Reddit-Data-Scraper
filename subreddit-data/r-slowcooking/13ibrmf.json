I checked the temperature of the liquid in the cooker and it's 92 degrees Celsius. \n\nI seared the beef in the pan before cooking on it. I checked on it after 3 hours and it was also a lump of rubber and nothing has changed in the subsiquent four hours.",

Big chunks of meat will go through that hard rubbery phase before it gets to the tender shreddable one. More time and maybe cut it into large pieces to cut down the time if needed",

The issue here is that it\u2019s a huge chunk of meat. I would put it on high for at least an hour and then drop to low for 1-2 hours more.  If you are using a big cut of beef, I would start on high for 2 hours then drop to low for 8 more hours.  If you are cooking vegetables with it, I would add those when you reduce to low.  Otherwise they will pretty much disintegrate to nothing.",

But you pointing at sources that are just random people saying the same thing as you, without evidence, does not make it an objective fact.  I may not be a slow cooker expert, but what I do know a lot about is physics.\n\nWhen you cook something, there are three main reserves of heat. The stuff you're cooking, the air in the cooking vessel, and the cooking vessel itself.\n\nOf these three things, the atmosphere in the vessel holds the least amount of heat by far. The stuff being cooked (typically lots of liquid + ingredients that also hold a bunch of liquid) has a thermal mass that is orders of magnitude larger than the heat in the air. Then you have the cooking vessel, which is also significantly more thermal mass than a few grams worth of hot water vapor.\n\nThat said, opening the slow cooker isn't a great idea while it's coming up to its target temp, because that's when you need every bit of thermal energy to go into the food to bring it up to the cooking temp. However, once it's been brought up to temp, opening the lid once in a while is going to make as much of a dent in the heat of the overall system as opening the bathroom door for a second is going to make in the heat of your bath water when taking a hot bath.  Yeah, the air will be cold for a few seconds, but the relatively massive thermal mass of the hot water will quickly re-warm the air once the door is closed again.",

From my own experience not just the articles it does though. A slow cooker lid will start to clacker when the pressure is trying to escape - and yes yes just like a pressure cooker there is immense heat waiting just underneath. Heat rises by nature, giving only a brief moment to stir will result in a quick drop in temp. I implore you to get yourself a thermometer and test temperatures.",

Air expands when heated. That rattling is not the \"heat trying to rise,\" it's the fact that you've got the same mass of air now wanting to take up a significantly larger volume, and the lid is pushing back on that force. That's what creates the pressure.\n\nBut the only heat that escapes when you open the lid is the heat in the air (and the vapor in that air), which is a pittance compared to the amount of heat in the cooking food.  It will continue to lose heat while the lid is open, but I'm not advocating for you to leave the top off for a long period of time - 30 seconds, though, to test the temp or doneness is not going to hurt anything if done 3-4 times over a 8-10 hour cook.\n\nI'll be happy to break out my thermopen the next time I slow cook something.",

It's possible that you've used far too little liquid - 1.6kg of meat is quite a bit I'd be looking to have at least 4 cups (~1L) of liquid to make sure its able to braise properly.",

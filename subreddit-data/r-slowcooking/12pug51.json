    "postText": "I need ya'll's opinions. I'm thinking about making crockpot pesto chicken but I'm wondering if ya'll think I should wait to put the pesto in until I shred the chicken (then mix in cream/cheese and let it sit for a while) or put it in when I start the chicken. I used to put BBQ sauce in from the start and realized the chicken juices diluted the sauce, and I don't want a watery pesto chicken. Would you put it in before or after the chicken is mostly done?",

My train of thought would be to cook the chicken in water initially by itself. Then as you say shred it, you could still keep the liquid especially if it's reduced by then and if you're adding other vegetables otherwise just pour it down sink and re-start with a cream base pasta sauce and / or cheese etc. Of which you could add the Pesto then or just wait until serving and dollop on top.",

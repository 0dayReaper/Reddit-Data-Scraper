    "postText": "  \n\nMy husband does the grocery shopping. He came home with a package of sausage links that needed to be used by 3/5. So, we decided to slow cook them in some sauce for future dinners as we are a household of two people.  \n A couple hours after turning it on I threw out my back so any movement was virtually impossible. When I got ready to go to bed he said he would turn the sausage off. I woke up this morning to burnt sausage with burnt sauce. Guess who is not going to clean this mess!?!  \nEnjoy the image I attached, lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Yup, its dead](https://imgur.com/a/i4m2jAD)",

I cracked all of them bad boys and set them on a nice simmer. Plenty of water. I had an emergency come up and had to run across town. Totally forgot to turn them off or add more water, just in case. It took a few hours and by the time I got home, the kitchen was filled with smoke. They were completely burnt almost ashes. The house stank for DAYS! It was my only big pot so I was determined to clean it. It took a couple of weeks of soaking and scrubbing. I tried everything anyone recommended. Including dryer sheets. I did finally get it clean though. I kept that pot even after I totally upgraded a few years later. I finally passed it down when my nephew moved out on his own.",

I guess I just always assumed that if you like the way the food tastes after the techniques you use, then you're objectively not making the food worse. But this would seem to imply that that is not true, that there's actually some scientific, objective standard against which the quality of food ought to be judged. I wonder how they first calculated this?",

They're both in that category of \"vegetable savories\", which is why you can find abundant peanut sauce recipes online that use both peanut butter and onions together.\n\n&gt;There are things you \u201cshould\u201d and \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d do according to the known science of whatever you\u2019re doing...

Not just an opinion, not just \"I don't like sausages cooked this way\" but, *fundamentally* wrong to do, as a matter of... well, as a matter of *something*. Aesthetics, maybe. Perhaps \"appropriateness for the social class that the clientele of some particular restaurant most often comes from.\"\n\nWell, presumably people who slow-cook their sausages were never told what you were told, such that as a result, they didn't know that they aren't supposed to like sausages cooked that way.",

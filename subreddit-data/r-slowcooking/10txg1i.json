It\u2019s why \u2018the soup\u2019 gets so much flack on this sub. I mean, there\u2019s a perfectly adequate soup sub? But this recipe has no place in slow cooking.",

The evaporation of water or liquids happen at very slow rate and are very minimal in a croc pot unlike the pot where at times water may need to be added causing to dilute the flavoring. \n\nYou may be limiting yourself in not seeing the slow cooker as a more versatile way of cooking. It\u2019s function allows for more than just making red meat or pork tender.",

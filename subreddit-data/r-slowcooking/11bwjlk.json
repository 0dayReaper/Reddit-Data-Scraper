    "postText": "Just put together my first pot roast here are my ingredients \n- 3.2 lb chuck roast\n- 1 white onion\n- 4 carrots\n- 5 yellow potatoes \n- 3 stalks of celery and their greens\n- 1 package whole button mushroom\n- 2 cups unsalted beef broth\n- 1 cup red wine\nSeasoned the roast with salt and pepper and seared it on all sides. Put in the crockpot and it\u2019s been on low for 4 hours and has about 4 more to go. \n\nIs there any tips to be sure this roast will be juicy and super tender? Does this recipe seem like it will turn out okay? I\u2019m just nervous that I should have done something different. \n\nThanks everyone!",

It's hard to screw up with a slow cooker but not impossible. \nAnd I always put the veggies in right away because I'm not home to do it at noon and they're ok. Just slice them a bit bigger so they don't finish as soon. \nHere's a super simple delicious recipe.\n1 can beef broth.\n1 pk. Au jus gravy mix\n1 pk. Good Seasons Italian salad dressing\nStir it together and drop in your roast. Cook on low for 10 to 11 hours. The juice makes a tasty French dip if you want. Or save juice in fridge overnight and spoon off the grease in the morning. Freeze it and use it for making beef vegetable soup when you have a soup craving.",

The only thing you may be missing is some salt for the veggies; potatoes especially love salt. But you can always add that when it's time to eat. \n\nDang, now I want some pot roast. :)",

            "comment": "Sounds good!! I recently did a chuck roast and left it on high for 8 hours and I found out through this group that I need to let chuck roasts cook longer! Turn it on high and let it go for another 5-6 hours if possible. Also yes, your veggies will be over done.. so I also learned that from now on I will add the meat, let it cook for 5-6 hours then I\u2019ll add the veggies for the last 3-4\n\nEdit to add: If you can\u2019t let it go longer today, it won\u2019t be tough! I just found my chuck roast that I cooked for 10 hours was way more tender then my 7-8 hour one! So enjoy either way",

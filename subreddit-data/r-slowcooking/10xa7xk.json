However many you want, I usually do around 6. Drain and mash the potatoes. I like to leave them a bit chunky.\n\nAdd crumbled cotija or queso fresco cheese and salt. However much you think tastes good. I usually do at least a cup of cheese. If you like you can also add a bit of cumin or garlic powder, but I usually don\u2019t. You could also add a saut\u00e9ed chopped onion.\n\nYou\u2019ll need a stack of 6 inch or smaller corn tortillas, however many you need to use up the filling. For each taco, first heat your tortilla on a griddle so it\u2019s soft and pliable. Put a scoop of the filling on one half of the tortilla, fold it over, and flatten it gently so it stays folded. Don\u2019t overfill the tortilla. \n\nOnce they\u2019re all filled, heat about an inch or inch and a half of frying oil in a pan over medium heat. Put a couple of tacos into the oil. Use a spatula to firmly press down the edges of tacos while frying to prevent them from opening. Fry till they\u2019re golden and crispy, about 2 minutes per side. Set them on some paper towel to drain the excess oil while you fry the rest. \n\nEat up!\n\nPotato tacos are very flexible though, so tweak till they\u2019re how you like them!",

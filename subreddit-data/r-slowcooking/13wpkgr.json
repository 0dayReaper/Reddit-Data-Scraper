Then cook that concoction on low for a few hours.  Then give the inside a good scrub with a Scotch-Brite scrubber or something similar.\n\nIf that still doesn't work, you could check for any cracks or flaws in the enamel.  If those exist, it may be worth tossing (since replacement crocks can sometimes be almost as expensive as a new slow cooker). But like you said, you don't see any obvious ones.\n\nI wouldn't worry about roaches or critters unless you see them.  Slow cookers are pretty basic appliances, so there aren't TOO many places for them to be hiding out. Though, as someone else said, if it makes you feel better just put it in an airtight bag for a few weeks.",

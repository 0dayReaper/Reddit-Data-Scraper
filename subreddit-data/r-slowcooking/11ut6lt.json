    "postText": "There are a lot of great recipes on this sub, but quite a few have an ingredient that is 'taco seasoning mix' or 'Ranch mix' could this sub have a wiki or pinned post with a common mix of spices that would do instead, for those of us that live in place that don't commonly sell the mixes to save us having to individually look them up?\n\n**Taco seasoning mix**\n\nIngredients\n\n    2 tbsp chilli powder, or to taste\n    2 tbsp ground cumin\n    1 tbsp sweet paprika\n    1 tbsp dried oregano\n    1 tbsp garlic powder\n    1 tsp onion powder\n    1 tsp black pepper\n    1 tsp salt\n\n**Ranch Seasoning**\n\nIngredients\n\n    1/2 cup dry Buttermilk Powder*\n    1 tbsp. Dried Parsley\n    2 tsp. Dried Dill \n    1 tsp. Freeze Dried Chives\n    1 tbsp. Garlic Powder\n    1 tbsp. Onion Powder\n    1 tsp. Salt\n    1/2 tsp. Ground Black Pepper\n\nButtermilk powder isn't common here either,  so hopefully buttermilk will do if you cut down a little on other liquids.",

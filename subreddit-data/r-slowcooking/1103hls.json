You don't want it to dwell unplugged for very long but 15 minutes should be fine especially if it's cooked all day",

You might need 10 or so for one twice as big.\n\nIf you live 5 minutes away, and are basically unplugging it, toting it to the car, bringing it into the house and plugging it back in, then you\u2019ll be totally fine.",

I usually smoke them but it's been raining all week needed a way to get some bbq for the superbowl. Can't say I'm the biggest fan of slow cooking a shoulder, but it does taste good",

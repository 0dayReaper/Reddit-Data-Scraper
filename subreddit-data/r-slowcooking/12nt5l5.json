I have never made or tasted Mississippi pot roast before and I\u2019m just wondering if there is a strong ranch dressing taste to it when it\u2019s done.  I don\u2019t want to cook something he\u2019s not going to eat.\n\nEDIT - thank you to everyone for responding!  Your comments are helpful.",

The Mayo and milk makes ranch. The roast tastes nothing like it though. \n\nBut if you\u2019re going to make it, I reccomend only half the butter it calls for, and I like doing brown gravy instead of the one it calls for. It makes it less salty but tastes almost the same otherwise. I just throw a couple spoon fulls of butter most of the time",

The acid of the pepperonci juice and the butter balance each other out, so adjusting one means the other will need to be adjusted as well, or if you want a more buttery/tangy flavor, adjust accordingly. \n\nThere is a lot of salt in the ranch/au jus packs, so using less can be beneficial with smaller cuts.

My husband loves it this way now also so her recipe is just for the beef; whether you add vegetables or not is up to you, I\u2019m sure it would still be fine. \n\n* 1 chuck roast with \u201ca good marble\u201d as she\u2019d say\n* Some flour for dusting \n* Seasoned Salt to taste\n* Black pepper to taste \n* 1 pkg of McCormick Bag n\u2019 Season for pot roast (don\u2019t need the bag though)\n* 1 can of family size cream of mushroom soup\n* 1/4 cup Worcestershire Sauce\n* 2-3 tblsp oil\n\nIn a ziplock bag or whatever you prefer, add the flour, seasoned salt &amp; pepper - shake to mix. Add the roast and shake to dust on all sides. Set it aside and let it rest to get to room temp while getting everything else ready.\n\nIn a crockpot, add the cream of mushroom soup, McCormick seasoning, and Worcestershire Sauce and mix well. It won\u2019t look like a lot gravy/sauce but there will be plenty by the time it\u2019s ready to eat. \n\nHeat oil in skillet (we always use a cast iron but use whatever you have).  Shake off any excess flour from the roast and add it to the skillet. Let it brown before turning it over and then brown the other side.  I brown the edges too but that may not make a difference. Add the roast to the crockpot (I always spoon the soup mixture over it to make sure it\u2019s covered). \n\nIf adding vegetables, I\u2019d add a 1/4 cup of unsalted beef broth to the mixture. \n\nSet the crockpot on low for 8-hours or on high for 4-6 hours.",

You can experiment with different potatoes but just a regular russet will do fine\n\n1 whole yellow onion. chopped\n\n1 slab o beef\n\nsalt and pepper to taste\n\nI tend to marinate my roast in pretty much anything but certainly whatsthiheresauce for a few hours.\n\nOnce your ready to go brown your roast with a bit of flour in a cast iron skillet. brown all sides.\n\nOnce it's brown simply put it in the slow cooker. Chunk in the other ingredients pour your can of soup and can of broth in there. Put the lid on and let it eat for a good four hours. Hook up some white popcorn rice and serve. Pressure cooker is the same except it will be ready in about an hour. Source: 7th generation Mississippian.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: damn sure no ranch.",

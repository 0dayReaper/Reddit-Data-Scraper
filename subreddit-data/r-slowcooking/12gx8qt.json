Sear that bitch in the oven 500 degrees for 5-10 minutes. When you get to your desired sear, drop the temp to 350 and cook about 15 minutes per pound for a medium rare. Up the time for desired temp.

In the oven you'll have a gradient from crust at the edge to medium rare (or whatever you cook to) in the center. \n\n\nReverse searing it, where you cook in the oven at 250F until the internal temp is around 120F, then sear for 30 seconds a side in a really hot pan, is a good way also.",

I like to add a few cups of dark beer and drizzle the roast with maple syrup. If possible, balance the roast on the bones with the fat side up. \n\nPreheat your oven to 500 degrees. \n\nAdd uncovered roast to the oven and close the door. Roast at 500 for 5 minutes per pound (17 minutes for your cut) and then turn off your oven. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR.\n\nLet the roast sit in the hot, closed oven, which you've turn off, for two to three hours. \n\nRemove from the oven, slice, and enjoy with a creamy horse radisch sauce.",

                    "comment": "\\+1 to this. Source: I used to cook prime rib for a few local restaurants, did \\~150 #/week for 4 years. Everyone does the same: 150-160 degrees until internal temp hits 145 (can take 8 hours). If unsure how to season:\n\n* Cover fat cap with granulated garlic until it is yellow.\n* Add black pepper till it is obvious it has a thin coat of pepper.\n* Add kosher salt until it is well dusted (but even).\n\n1/4 inch from each end will be medium well. Rest of cut will be a perfect medium. Don't even think about touching this to a grill. \n\nWhen cutting, make sure to deliver all the crust from the garlic/pepper/salt combo. I like to use my knife to spread it on top. \n\nFor cooking, a variation I absolutely adore is this: put meat in a smoker for first 2 hours on low heat (\\~225). Then, transfer to oven until internal temp hits 145.",

A tender cut like this gets slowly cooked  to render the fat and get to temp in the center while keeping it red (or pink if preferred) and steak like, and hit with high heat (usually before roasting) to crisp up the outside.  A tough cut gets put in a crockpot to become pot roast. So the point many people are making is, why make a pot roast with a roast beef quality cut. It will taste more or less the same as any other cut becoming a pot roast. Cooking this in the oven (or slicing it into thick steaks to pan sear or maybe grill on very high heat) will give you a meal that you couldn't replicate with cheaper cuts of meat.",

    "postText": "Sorry gang ! I forgot I had a play date with baby goats today ( yes, really! )  and had to leave before I could post the results. \n\n\n My roommate took it out too early because she thought we were running out of time to leave for said baby goat date.  and she is not. As you can see it cracked on the way out and could have used another 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n I had just checked it before hopping in the shower thinking I could shower, take it out get ready while it cooled and eat half a muffin cake ( served two) but she is a slow cooker skeptic and does not worship at the \"Fix It and Forget It Temple like I do.\n\nTaste results?\n \nPretty good. One thing I forgot was that when I made the lemon blueberry version I went total vegan on the egg because I thought an egg would give it that microwave rubbery mug cake texture. Today I used an egg because I didn't want to fuss  and with the shorter cook time,  it was more dense than I remembered, but still tasty!\n\n\nSo, next week if I don't make bread or a cookie, I'm going to use Kathy Hester's recipe as written with the vegan egg replacer.\n\nI give it a seven out of 10. 6 because  it satisfied a muffin craving without heating up the house but could have used a longer cook time and rest and v ganized to egg.1 extra point because it's a excellent troll bait.",

She has a Turkish delight Tapioca pudding I really like out of her Vegan Slow Cooker. Maybe I'll make that next weekend.\n\nI also might make one of her Layer Dinners. Like her Thanksgiving dinner one was really nice, I just used a chicken cutlet or turkey cutlet instead of setain. Her portobello mushroom roast Layer dinner is really good. She puts portobello mushroom on one layer, a potato, and a vegetable with a really good sauce. \n\nShe's vegan and low sugar, offers gluten and soy free options. I don't always follow those vegan suggestions in her recipes, like I'll use chicken and dairy instead of tofu and seitan a lot of times, but as far as innovation and ideas, her cookbooks are a good resource.",

But like it was 110 f outside, my ac doesn't work too well, and I have a gas stove/oven with no real ventilation. So crockpot it was. It definitely wasn't as good as a proper frittata, but I am okay with that.",

During those days I make potato based leek or celery soup, chill it and eat it with homemade hummus.the hummus got it's start in the slow cooker.\n\n My grocery order came with four! packs of tofu so I'm going to make overnight tofu scramble this week for vegan breakfast burritos. The haters can go rot in an  unmarked grave because yes I *am* cooking tofu in my slow cooker.\n\nYeah when it comes to home cooking there's this uptick in what I call Gordon Ramsay / Food Network/ TikTok food influencer judgment  effect.\n\n like dude/dudette,  I'm a single tired working class  middle aged lady who works 12 hour shifts, do you think I got time to make my meals look and taste like something Thomas Keller just \"whipped up\" ?  Sure if company's coming I'll do it fancy, but honestly I just can't do that for every meal and I haven't killed myself yet with my ugly slow cooker meals.\n\nDon't let perfect be the enemy of good enough.",

    "postText": " So a pound of cubed steaks seasoned and salted the night before, seared in a pan, and tossed in a crockpot. Fry up some onions, broccoli stalk (use heads to roast), and probably mushrooms, then toss with steaks. Add about a few tablespoons of butter, and \u2153 cup of flour, and cook for like 2 minutes. Throw in 3 cups of milk, stir, then toss over steaks. Add a bouillon cube, and cook low for 6 to 7 hours.",

Both can be good! Infact OPs chili looks fuckin rad.",

Cincinnati-style chili--a more or less homogeneous, vaguely Greek-spiced meat sauce--is best suited for use as a topping on hot dogs, French fries, spaghetti, etc. Chili like the OP made, while I'm sure it's delicious, is too chunky to make a suitable chili dog. There's just too much going on.",

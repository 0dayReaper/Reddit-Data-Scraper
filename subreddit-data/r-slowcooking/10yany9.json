Made many a batch of\u2026 well not Pico but very similar (I worked in a pizza place, so chopped tomatoes with onion, oil, red pepper, garlic for pizza topping) in a metal bowl. That\u2019s totally fine you just don\u2019t want to store it in the metal. I could clearly see that was a mixing bowl. I prefer metal mixing bowls too, don\u2019t hold flavors like plastic! Plastic also is more likely to get grooves etc that can be a breeding ground for bacteria.",

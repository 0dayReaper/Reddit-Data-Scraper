    "postText": "Maybe 2-4 years ago I made a stew which contained IIRC cabbage, chicken meat (breasts/thighs?) and sausage: I hink it was salsiccia and the sausage filling was used like ground meat, not sausage slices (like kielbasa).   \n\nI'm sure I got the idea and the recipe from this sub, but I can't find anything close to it anymore. Does anybody have an idea what I'm talking about? Or does my memory fool me and it was just cabbage and chicken or cabbage and ground sausage?\n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: I think it was some Zuppa Toscana with cabbage instead of kale/spinach and my faulty memory added some chicken that never was there ;)",

I will take it and run with it, as per my usual bung-stuff-together-and-see-what-works process. I will add the obviously required onions and garlic  and sort through the crisper and freezer to see what else. Great!  A mystery meal again!",

Just sprinkle it on the meat to marinate for a couple of hours and then cover it with water and let it cook.\n\n I cook it on high for a good hour and then turn it to low and just let it cook. Mine always falls apart and so tender.\n\n If you want veggies just add them a couple of hours before serving. Turn the cooker up to high so the veggies get done. Especially the carrots and potatoes!\n\n I seen so many Mississippi Pot Roast recipes but I was surprised how salty mine was and I followed a recipe exactly.\n I am going to try it again but next time I think I\u2019ll use one with the Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of the Hidden Ranch just to see how it tastes! Never know until you try it out I guess.",

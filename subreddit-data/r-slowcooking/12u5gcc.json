Never made it to the store. Maybe tomorrow. Luckily I have a thing in the freezer somewhere. I'm not really sure if I ate it yet. But I think it's in there somewhere.",

The juice from the cooking dripped on the meat below on a rotisserie so it was really juicy and full of flavor. \nNow that I\u2019m cooking for just myself I make bbq in my slow cooker. Throw in a boston butt, pour a can of whatever soda I have, cover &amp; cook. The carbonation in the soda helps tenderize the meat. 4 hours on high or 8 hours on low.  Then just pull apart and shred the pork, add your favorite sauce and cook in the oven about 10 minutes to cook the sauce in. I like it so much better than restaurant bbq, and I have leftovers for days!",

If you live a life that has you on your own property, mostly working outside of the house but sometimes coming in at odd moments ( little vegetable farm,) it can be useful to use a crockpot for this.\n\nI\u2019ve come inside to grab a snack or use the washroom, and think well, I\u2019m inside right now, and just washed up and clean, it might be a useful time to throw something in the crockpot that just needs a few hours cooking, not all day, and then I won\u2019t have to worry about dragging my tired body in at the end of the day and cooking supper.",

Usually \u2018Zephyr\u2019 from Johnnys Select Seeds, not regular zucchini. I can\u2019t tell you how long I cook it for - this would be something I\u2019d start early in the afternoon, maybe after a late lunch. Then back to work to pick more of it\u2026\n\nI promise you it doesn\u2019t wind up mushy!\n\nEdit: yeah, the more I think of it, the more I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the squash. Zephyr passes as a zucchini for most uses but it\u2019s got a lot of other, less watery squashes in its heritage and it\u2019s quite a bit firmer after cooking. If you have a garden you should try growing it, it\u2019s wonderful.",

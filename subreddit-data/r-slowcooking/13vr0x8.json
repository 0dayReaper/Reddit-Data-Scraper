Might be regional dialect?\n\n---\n\nEdit 2: I was curious about the word \"goober\" and did some digging.\n\nApparently it's ultimately from the word _nguba_ from the [Kikongo language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kongo_language), a Bantu-family language spoken in Congo.  It came into American English via [Gullah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullah_language).\n\n* \"Goober\" at Merriam-Webster: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/goober\n* \"Goober\" at Wiktionary: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/goober",

The other one I have is an enclosed metal mesh like one that you\u2019d use for making popcorn perhaps. Makes it perfect for shaking and getting the heat and smoke to everything. \n\nI usually boil for about 1.5-2 hours with spices. Salt, Everglades, chili peppers, BBQ rub - whatever I feel like, honestly. Then I remove them from the boil and drain them. I suppose you could keep the water for whatever reasons to use at a different time if you\u2019re into conservation. Anyways, I drain them and put them on a paper towel and pat them to remove the excess water. Then I coat them in olive oil and whatever spices I want the shell to have. I put them on the smoker anywhere from a smoker temp to 250ish, shaking them every 15 minutes or so. From there it just depends on how crispy you want them. An hour begins to give you some crisping and obviously any time longer continues that process.\n\nYou can eat the shell if you want or just get the flavor off it and then enjoy a nice warm peanut that bursts with flavor. \n\nThe biggest problem I have with them is that they don\u2019t last long at my house AT ALL!",

Mmmmm \n\nThe e kind you get in the can from peanut patch are usually on the crunchy side. They tend to use large nuts and there's rarely more than three in a casing. These are your desperate go to I need boiled peanuts thing. Not a whole lot of flavor outside of salt unless you get the kind that they now sell with barbecue or whatever and I've honestly never tried them. \n\nThere are red skin peanuts and white skin peanuts. Each has a subtle different flavor. They taste like beans.  They are in the legume family. They're not actually nuts.  If I recall correctly, the Redskin ones lean more toward black eyed peas and the white skin ones lean more toward Northern or navy beans. It's been a very very long time since I've had any good ones so forgive me.\n\nThe Redskin ones are my favorite. They tend to be  smaller beans with more in the casing. \n\nWhen I was a kid about the only place to find them was on our trips to the mountains and there would be roadside stands. Big black kettles. Dang they were so good I love them. In my late 30s I traveled back to Georgia and you could get them in convenience stores. But honestly they're nothing like the kettle cooked.  They're the canned version.  \n\nA guy I worked with visited South Carolina I believe and he brought me back a little packet of boiled peanuts and said he bought them in a convenience store. I was stunned because growing up they didn't have them like that.\n\nWhen I went to Georgia a few times I went overboard during The peanut festival eating those kettle cooked ones. All I'm saying if you're constipated you won't be after eating a slew of them. Prepare to spend about 12 hours on the porcelain throne. \n\nOnce my mom sent me some green peanuts I boilrd them for 36 hours and those suckers never got soft. However a co-worker says her daughter will take regular peanuts in the shell and boil them. No clue how that turns out. Maybe one day I will try that in my instapot.",

Thompson as a guest performer, and they were kind of teasing him about scapple being a regional favorite where he grew up. \n\nHe replied \"Well, my wife is from Georgia and she eats boiled peanuts!\" to which some audience members cheered. He and Kevin Murphy starts pointing at those people going \"Wrong.\", \"Wrong, guys.\" \"It's boiled peanuts.\"\n\nMeh. It's funnier when they did it.",

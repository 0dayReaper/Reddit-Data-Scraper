Ingredients are :- \n\nChicken carcass and wings (all meat pulled off), resting juices, onion, mushrooms, garlic, bay leafs, thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper, water. I\u2019d usually use fresh herbs but I was out so dry will have to do. \n\nChuck it all in a pot, simmer for 3-4 hours minimum, strain and use for soup or whatever.",

When training in classic french restaurant cooking, you are always taught to not put mushrooms in stocks &amp; jus etc because it makes it cloudy when you're generally looking for a nice clean liquid. However they are very flavourful and have loads of umami so if you're not bothered about that sort of thing they can be a good addition. I'd always use mushrooms if I was making anything veg based because they're so flavourful it's almost like you've used bones.",

Mushrooms are delicious but I never have scraps! \n\nDefinitely avoid broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and other cruciferous veg (makes the stock a bit...farty) and bell pepper scraps (can definitely make it bitter). \n\nSerious Eats have a good write up with more detail; https://www.seriouseats.com/save-your-vegetable-scraps-make-stock\n\nEdit: I don't use onion or garlic skins like serious eat suggests, because I don't think there's enough flavour or nutrition in them to bother.

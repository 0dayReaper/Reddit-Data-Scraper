    "postText": "Feel like this is a dumb question, but I\u2019m a college student who just bought a Farberware pressure cooker that has a slow cooking option but it\u2019s all at 1 temp, no high or low. The manual says that the slow cooking is at about 206 F. Will the chicken be cooked or should it need more time? I might be overthinking this but it\u2019s my first time using one :)",

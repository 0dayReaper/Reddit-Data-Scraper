You can always use regular French baguettes but if you have access to a Vietnamese bakery or a Vietnamese Sandwich shop such as Lee\u2019s Sandwiches I highly recommend! Vietnamese French baguettes are made with rice flour and have a crispy exterior and a lighter fluffier interior than traditional French baguettes. \n\n\n(Optional) Warm up bread in oven at 250 degrees for 3-4 minutes for a little extra crisp\n\nEdit: attempt to fix format\nETA: sear pork for about 2 minutes on all sides\n\nETA 3: revised recipe above",

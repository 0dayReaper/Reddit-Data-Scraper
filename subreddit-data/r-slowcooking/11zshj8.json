    "postText": "We use a can of corn, one red pepper diced, a cup of salsa, half a bunch of cilantro, zest of a lime, 3 tablespoons cumin, saisonne, garlic salt, chili powder, 8 chicken thighs and all of it covered in chicken broth. I cook on high for about 6 hours then shred for tacos, enchiladas, or burritos. I would have added a can of black beans but I didn't have any and if I wasn't sharing this with the kids I would have put half a small can of Chipotle in adobo sauce. I love that stuff.\n\nNice simple recipe to make before leaving for work or something. Plus my little kids love a chicken soft taco. Enjoy! I'm putting my 2-year-old down for a nap so I'll be around the answer questions.",

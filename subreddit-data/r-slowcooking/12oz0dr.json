    "postText": "My first time making split pea soup was at the height of the pandemic.  I wasn't able to get smoked ham hocks, so I substituted ham that I had available. It turned out great.  Recently, I made the same recipe but had access to smoked ham hocks.  My mom used smoked ham hocks for her split pea soup and it always turned out great.  The soup I made was good, but it thickened up way too much (like eat it with a fork and knife thick).  I am chalking this up to the huge amount of fat in the hocks.  There was almost no meat on these things (which I seem to remember from the times my mom made it, they had more meat than fat).  Anyone else experience this with the hocks that seem to be available today?",

If it is too thick while still hot, I would simply add more water to it but I honestly don\u2019t remember ever having that issue and I\u2019ve made it with hame chunks, a ham bone or ham hocks. Ham hocks definitely add more smoky flavor but I can\u2019t believe how expensive they are these days. \n\nGood luck.",

She thins mine out with stock.\n\nIf you have any left, freeze it and add it to the next batch made with ham like you did the first time. That way you get a little of the silkiness without it being overly thick.\n\nOr If you have capacity next time make a double batch with  same size ham hock and some ham or bacon?",

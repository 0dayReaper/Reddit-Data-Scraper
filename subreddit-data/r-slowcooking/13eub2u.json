    "postText": "Hey folks!\n\nI'm creating a slowcooker sandwich bar for an event of about 50 people. The goal is to have several slow cookers and then a selection of toppings and sauces so guests can create their own chicken sandwiches. They'll be assembled and served by a sandwich station attendant directly from the slowcooker.\n\nQuestions:\n A) How many slowcookers? I need the recipe to cook as quickly as possible onsite while not compromising quality. I'd rather have more cookers and less time if possible. I'd estimate 4 ounce portions of chicken per sandwich. So let's call it 13 lbs chicken\n\n\n B) What's your favorite recipe that is tasty but somewhat neutral so it works with a wide range of sauces? bbq, teriyaki, pesto, ranch, honey mustard, etc",

Maybe see if you can find one of his, like this, [Chef John Sloppy Chicken](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/285078/pulled-chicken-sloppy-joes-sloppy-chickens/) and just alter or eliminate some ingredients to make in more neutral ?",

            "comment": "I suggest using an Instant Pot. Put in whole chicken and pressure cook for 40 minutes. You have chicken falling off bone. I just use salt both sides and ground pepper and add 2 c chicken broth to bottom and pressure cook on high. This even works on frozen chicken. I just did my second time today and legs and wings fell off and breast is so juicy and tender. doing like this will allow you to cook less time and can do 3 one right after other in about 2 hrs. Then have sauces ready. I love doing this. Another cooking while  you are cutting and shredding last one that finished . Pile up in metal pan and have sauces.",

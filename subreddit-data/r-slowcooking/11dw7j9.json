Or, to improve texture/improve the color of meat to look more appetizing, or to speed up/balance cooking time between meat and vegetables. \n\nEven if you're cooker doesn't have heat from the bottom for true sauteing or browning, you can just throw all of your ingredients in and cook on high for 4-5 hours or on low for 7-8 hours. For texture sake, you could also, for example, put some loose ground meat/sausage in the pot first, cook for a 1/2-1 hour on high, stir and cook for another 1/2-1 hour, stir/crumble it up, then add the rest of your ingredients and cook to the recipe's suggested time. It may not be skillet browned but it will be cooked and taste fine.",

            "comment": "Taco Soup. It's a pretty adaptable recipe to your tastes/budget. You can skip the prepackaged ingredients and use your own seasonings, if you want ... you can even skip using ground meat entirely and just use beans, or cook the meat first in the cooker as I suggested in another comment. \n\nI discovered awhile ago that many marinade recipes work well with meat in the slow cooker, without bothering to pre-marinate. Just make the marinade and pour it over the raw meat in your cooker and cook until done - usually 4-5 hours on high or 7-8 hours on low, depending on the thickness of your meat.\n\nI'm especially fond of using boneless chicken thighs with a fajita marinade - you can then serve it over rice with the juices, or in fajitas, tacos, burritos, wraps, etc. \n\nAlso found this link for you:\n\nhttps://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/slow-cooker-one-pot-meals/\n\nBest of luck to you!",

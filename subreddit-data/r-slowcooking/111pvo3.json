Add butter slices to the top, and pour in the chicken broth.\nCook over low heat for 5-6 hours, or high heat for 3-4 hours. Remove the chicken from the pot and shred into large chunks with two forks.\nAdd the shredded chicken back to the pot along with the dry egg noodles and stir. Continue cooking for 30-45 minutes, until noodles are tender. Enjoy!",

Same thing with \"the soup\" that everyone makes. That tortellini is going to end up bloated, soggy, and gross if it sits in those juices.",

If you\u2019re going to set and forget, they will get a bit mushy and the carrots won\u2019t be as sweet tasting but won\u2019t be too mushy like bell peppers and the like would get.  A litttle trick I use is to lay them out on their own bit of foil, season them and add a pad of butter, add a top layer of foil so they each are in their own foil pouch.  Lay rhe potato one on top off whatever you have in your pot and carrots on top of that.",

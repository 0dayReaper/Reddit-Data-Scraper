    "postText": "I was wondering about cooking mostly thawed pork roast. The roast is around 5 lbs and it's in my 4 quart slowcooker. It is a thick cut of a meat and I believe it's mostly thawed but the center could still be a little frozen, however my question is will this be safe to eat if I slow cook it on low for around 12 hours?",

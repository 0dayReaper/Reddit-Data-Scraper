I picked up a bag of beef bones and planned to just toss them in but then I realized all the recipes are either baking them for marrow or cooking them in water with aromatics. My stew is pretty thick by now at hour 26 and even though plenty of solids in it have been eaten, it\u2019s still pretty thick and definitely not a watery consistency. \n\nCan I just throw them in or should I make broth separate and store them for adding later? I do have plenty of mason jars.",

Safest way would be to roast, make a separate stock with the roasted bones, reduce and taste it until it's awesome, then add it to your stew. But that's a lot more work. \n\nI say \"safest\" just because then you'd be able distinctly taste the flavor you'd be adding to your stew, but you probably don't have to be that careful.",

I had put cabbage in it and I forgot how cabbage smells when it cooks so I\u2019ve put a good 3 cups of water in and it seems a lot more balanced now. I think I had put way too much stuff in and the flavor profile was going crazy",

Same for the meat still stuck to them, it\u2019s dry and mostly drained of flavor. \n\nI also don\u2019t think they change the flavor that much in something like a stew. Obviously more flavorful than water. They will add a lot of good minerals and can thicken it though.",

No one wants bone fragments in their stew, that tooth chipping material right there. \n\nSo I'd probably make it separate.",

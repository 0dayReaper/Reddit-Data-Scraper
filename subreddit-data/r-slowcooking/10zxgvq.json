I think there's also wisdom in knowing what exceptions work for *you*. :)\n\nTrying to think of an example - a mushroom/egg type slicer. Holds the item and has grooves so you can cut set size slices. A bit silly to me - I can cut things with my knife. But maybe someone has trouble making even cuts and/or holding the thing, and that helps them - well, for them, it's not dumb.\n\nSo I don't have or want an egg cooker \u2014 but sounds perfect for you. I'm not better than you in the slightest. And with it, you can - if it's the thing I'm thinking of - do some neat things I can't, like make round eggs that fit perfectly on english muffins. (I assume that's also what you mean by the McDonald's patterns)\n\nI have a mouli. It's basically a hand-cranked food processor. Uses discs like a food processor to slice or grate. I could pull out a food processor, but the mouli is quicker, smaller, easier to clean. And I can easily grate something like a pound of cheese in a minute. So it's faster and safer than a box grater. They cost $35-$40, so few people want them, but I grew up having one and had to have one because I love it. I also use it on potatoes for browns, carrots for salads. Mostly those three (cheese, carrots, potatoes) and maybe once every couple of weeks or so. But I'm happier with it. :)",

Although granted I don't use it that often but still. It's lasted.

They can make 1-2 cups very well, and 3 cups in a pinch, whis is enough for about 6 people.  They can make 0.5 cups too, and it's acceptable but not as good.",

In your backyard? Or you have a farm? Or some kind of container?\n\nI'm from many, many generations of farmers in the Midwest, and I've known plenty of other farmers. (I didn't farm, but grew up around it, and I am a passionate organic gardener.) I've never known anyone who grew rice!!! It seems so exotic (though they grow good rice in Arkansas, but my Arkansas cousins were not farmers). Here we (my family, neighbors) mostly grow field corn, wheat, alfalfa and soybeans. \n\nAnd what kind of rice do you grow? Are you Japanese or a transplant? Sorry to be so nosy...I'm excited by this. And won't be upset if you tell me to mind my own business.",

I have an American friend here in Japan, let\u2019s call him S, from Missouri who is a bit older than me. He gardens on a bit of land near his house, and knew I was interested in doing the same thing. This is going back 20 years. He was approached by a local guy. Let\u2019s call him T who had a spare bit of land he wanted someone to farm. In those days, for tax purposes, it was 1000% more efficient to have your land farmed on properly than leave it fallow. S wasn\u2019t interested, but he introduced me to T, and I started growing vegetables on Ts land. Word in our rural community spread that there were two foreigners who were keen gardeners, and we were approached by two retired Japanese guys who asked us if we\u2019d like to join their rice-farming cooperative. So the four of us worked together doing the semi traditional method of cutting and hanging the rice on bamboo poles to dry, then coming back to thresh it after a month. We did that for five years or so, but for various reasons that cooperative fell apart. I was then asked by T, who was now a good friend, if I would help him rice farm, and I\u2019ve been working with him ever since.",

Dump the rice and the hot water in the pot, bring back to a boil. Now it comes back to a boil very fast and no water gets evaporated, so you know your water to rice ratio is perfect. Then turn to low, Simmer 15 minutes. Take off heat, leave lid on. Rest for 5 minutes, then fluff with fork. Perf every time.",

Now, fried potatoes and onions, that was a staple alongside of cans of chili when I was a youth out hunting. The big thing was getting the cans of chili from the store with no beans. Nalley chili was the preferred, but finding their no beans chili often meant a visit to a neighboring state for whatever reason. Dad would have to add slices of fresh jalapenos to his. Oh the stories. Elliot would add two cans of water when he made it, and everyone grumbled that it was supposed to be chili, not soup! Jerry would insist on adding a can of green beans because the chili needed more beans!(often, a bit inebriated.)  Just about everyone had some kind of whatever on their hunting rig to cook on the engine, usually a can of chili.\n\nThanks for sharing your brilliance and taking me down these memories.",

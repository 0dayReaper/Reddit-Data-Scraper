So it sounds like it will just barely fit. As long as you can still get some liquid in there, it'll work. You might have to tent it with tin foil if the lid doesn't fit until it cooks down a little. \n\nI think at that point, I'd break out my big electric roaster. I've got one that will do a 20lbs turkey no problem.",

I was able to find a brand new, unopened 8qt crock pot at goodwill for under $20 so I decided to cut the meat in half but still, unfortunately, had to remove the bone. \n\nThe meat turned out really nicely. I did my best to adapt Kenji's BBQ pulled pork to a slow cooker recipe. It was obviously not as great as it would have been in a dutch oven in my opinion but it fed a bunch of people and everyone left my slow cookers scraped clean. \n\nI'd call it a win.\n\nThis was for my son's scouts event btw. Plenty of food but the pork shoulder was one of the very few dishes that was completely gone. I also supplied slider buns and Hawaiian rolls for serving.\n\nThanks everyone for all of the tips. This was the first time that I have attempted such a large batch of food.",

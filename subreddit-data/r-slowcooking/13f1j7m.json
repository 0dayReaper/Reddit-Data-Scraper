I'm not a fan of onions, either, but I grind it up in the food processor first instead of roughly chopping. It cooks down to nothing and just flavors the soup.\n\nIf you're not cooking for a big family, it freezes well. It's just my husband and me, and we usually eat at different times, so I get a couple of quart-sized bags leftover from each batch that I can lay flat in the freezer and take out to thaw overnight in the fridge when neither of us has time to cook.",

Most are just 8 hours on low, and oops if you left it an hour over.. not a big deal. Oops you were home on a day off and forgot to start it halfway through the day? This sub has taught me that 1 hour on high = 2 hours on low (loss of flavor but it's minimal compared to not eating pork ;)). Saved my life (or dinner anyway, which is life to some of us)",

No prep or messing about - open a can drain and pop it it. \nBest for bbq and stronger flavoured recipes rather than just a casseole/stew.\nFor those I just add whatever beans, pulses etc. I have around.\nOther than that frozen soya chunks can work. Can use dried but they need some prep so defeat the object of just throwing it all in a pot and walking away.",

            "comment": "Well, if your only hangup about meat is not being experienced, having a slow cooker is the best thing you could have done. Here's a simple one to try if you wanna feel confident: 2 cans of cream of golden mushroom soup, one cup of chicken stock, four chicken breasts and some frozen veggies. Chuck em all in the pot on high for about 4 hours, shred and then serve over rice.\n\nBut here's a meat-optional recipe, Three Sisters Soup:\n\n1 can of kidney beans\n\n1 can of lentils\n\n1 can of corn\n\n1/2 cup pumpkin puree\n\n1 liter of chicken or vegetable stock\n\nSome type of protein - I usually use game birds but you could use chicken or tofu if you wanted.\n\nhowever many chopped carrots you want\n\nhowever many diced bell peppers you want\n\nyou can also add chopped rutabaga, turnip, parsnip, green cabbage, or basically any veggies you want.\n\nas much garlic as you want\n\n2 tsp each of sage powder, curry powder, cayenne pepper and paprika. or more if you prefer a stronger flavor.\n\ncook over low for 6 hours. Add the pumpkin puree at the very end, at around 20 minutes remaining.\n\nUsually I add canned tomato and a bunch of diced onion in but you don't \\*have\\* to do this. The flavors will be a little less complex though. You might be able to deepen the flavor with a bit of lemon juice, or you can bring in the 'umami' that tomatoes and onions would have provided using dried shiitake mushrooms or maybe oyster sauce.\n\nThe 'three sisters' refers to the corn, beans and squash which were traditionally grown together in pre-colonial americas.",

Salt, pepper, Italian seasoning.  Put it in the crock on low before you go to work,  come back in 8 hours to greatness.  Especially if you make some cornbread to go with it.   You can also make a fantastic pot roast.  It's very easy and not much effort for fantastic results.  Get a roast.  Beef roast. Salt and pepper.  Brown in butter on all sides.  Cut an onion in 8ths, two cloves of garlic, two stalks celery and a carrot in the slow cooker.  Also a Serrano pepper.  Put a few dashes of Worcester sauce on the roast. Cover the roast with beef broth 18oz and if you have it, a cup of red wine. Cook on low for 8 hours. \nLast half hour,  take 2 tablespoons cornstarch and mix on 4oz water.  Pour in crackpot and stir . Should thicken gravy. Serve with rice or Mashed Potatoes.",

(salt and pepper to your taste) I don't really measure I just add as much as I feel like. I usually let it cook for 2-3 hours and then add the kale at the end. Delicious and it freezes beautifully for an emergency meal. I cook egg noodles separately so they don't get soggy and I add them to the soup when I serve it.\n\nI also use my slow cooker to make applesauce with local apples each fall. Just fill the cooker with diced peeled apples and leave it to cook with its lid off, stirring occasionally, until it reaches your desired consistency.",

Chop us say 3 sweet potatoes into smallish bits (skin on because that\u2019s where all the nutrients are \ud83d\ude09), chop up 3 carrots into smallish bits too (skin on), chop up a little blob of fresh ginger (skin OFF!) and pour in about 2 cups of water. Add a pinch of salt &amp; pepper and pop it all on the \u2018hot\u2019 setting for about 2 hours. When you can smell the yummy flavours in the air, that means that things are cooked.\n\nTurn your cooker off and squash up the ingredients with a potato masher (or blend them with a stick blender). \n\nServe and enjoy! This was the first thing I cooked in my tiny 1L slow cooker 2 years ago and I still cook it and love it.  If you want extra punch, add fresh chillis with the ginger. If you don\u2019t have fresh chilli or ginger, use dried or jarred - it works!\n\nIf you really want to jazz it up, after mashing or blending your soup, pour it into a bowl and add some chopped up coriander/cilantro and/or a spoonful of plain Greek yoghurt on the top of the bowled soup\u2026 then serve with a slice of nan bread (buy it frozen &amp; thaw it in the microwave for 30 secs). It is all so delicious together!\n\nGood luck in your quest and let us all know how you get on \ud83d\ude01\u270c\ufe0f",

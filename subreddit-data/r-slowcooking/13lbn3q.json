Next time, though, I cut the butter in half.  Next time after that I cut the butter to two tablespoons.  Couldn't tell the difference.  Just as good but having gone from major heart attack on a plate to minor heart attack on a plate.",

I imagine the same would happen with the beef in this, the only difference being that those compounds would transfer themselves into the braising liquid/sauce so you wouldn\u2019t loose it but it would make the meat \u201cless beefy\u201d!",

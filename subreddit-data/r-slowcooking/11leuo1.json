            "comment": "My old crockpot was just a basic $30 something one from Walmart that ran way hot and I had to cook everything on the low setting, and the liquids would be boiling after an hour. I got the ninja foodi and have cooked three roasts the exact same way I would in my old crock. 8 hours on low. As far as I can tell my old one ran way hotter, so I am not letting this one cook long enough? The roast is tough and inedible at this point. I turned it back into low once I got home from work hoping to salvage it.",

Each time you lift the lid off the cooker will add about 30-60 minutes additional cooking time needed.\n\nWhen you put the slow cooker on, what time was it and was it on high or low? How long did it go at that temp? When did you change the temp? How long was it at the second temp?\n\nAnother member will likely explain the full process of meat going tender, dry and tender again.\n\nBefore you cook again you can test the crockpot. Fill the cold crockpot with room temp. water up to the halfway height of the pot. Put the Lid on. Set for Low and let it cook for eight hours. Do NOT remove the lid while cooking. After eight hours immediately measure the water temp. in the crockpot. Somewhere about 180 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit is what you are looking for.",

They used an old tea chest filled with straw and put a casserole from the oven in the straw box to simmer all day. It was done to save energy. I'm single and only do small portions. I heat the meat in gravy to a simmer. I then fill a pre-heated vacuum flask with the meat and gravy and leave it for at least two hours (I do this when I go camping too), four is better and the meat is completely cooked and very tender. I just re-heat the meet and serve. It is as tender as can be. I can't understand what's going on. If I were you I would try my method and see if it works. That will help explain what's going on. I have never had trouble like this slow cooking and I'm seventy.  Is it possibly the meat?",

Raising the temperature higher doesn't make this go faster, but it does make the meat dry out faster, which is why \"low and slow\" is such commonly seen advice.\n\nCuts with a lot of collagen that work well this way include beef chuck, pork butt and pork shoulder, and chicken thighs.  Cuts that do not work well this way are the more tender cuts like filet mignon, pork loin, chicken breast and fish.",

    "postText": "Hey gang. I love my slow cooker and have a few go-to recipes. However I've been trying to broaden my options and tried a few new things recently.\n\nUnfortunately, everything is coming out just really wet. I'm following recipes exactly (I did try changing a 4 person recipe to a 2 person but when that didn't work out I reverted to following precisely). I've tried using a cornstarch + water mix to thicken up but it's a bit hit or miss.\n\nIs the answer as simple as just putting less liquid in? If a recipe says 400ml of stock should I try knocking it down to 300? It's frustrating because a recipe should just work!\n\nAny tips much welcomed.",

Recipes I've done in winter vs. summer or even as mentioned elsewhere, where meat was purchased can change the moisture levels. if I see it's too much liquid, flip the lid sideways to let moisture evaporate but keep heat fairly level. About an hour usually does the trick.  Sometimes a cornstarch slurry helps, but not always. Sometimes...it's both.",

It holds moisture which is great for cooking some things, but it also makes some things as you say, very wet.  I tend to make things in my slow cooker that use this to an advantage, such as soups and stews.  Also things like an Indian dahl that absorbs a good deal of the liquid during the cooking process.",

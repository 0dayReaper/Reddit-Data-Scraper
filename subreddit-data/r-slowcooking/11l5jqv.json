There are some things that I want to point out though, because I'm bougie, pot roast is one of my specialties and I love sharing what (little) I know.\n\nPeeled carrots. You did that. Good. Peeled carrots are more tender when cooked peeled. Just make sure you keep cutting them large because small carrots turn to mush in a slow cooker. Same with the potatoes, big is best when you slow cook.\n\nOnions are good. Not just for flavor, but because they have an enzyme in the juice that breaks down meat. Keep that in mind, because you could cover a cheap steak (or other tough cut of meat) in fine chopped onions for an hour or two to tenderize them.\n\nThe meat: Totally optional, but for best results, you are gonna wanna sear the outside of the roast before you put it in the slow cooker. Just pat the meat dry with a paper towel, salt and pepper, then drop it into a hot oiled skillet until the outside is nice and brown on *at least* the largest sides.\n\nGarlic. Lots of it. Just drop a whole bunch into the pot, peeled and unchopped. Trust me, there's not much as satisfying as slow cooked garlic.\n\nAcids help make everything nice and tender if you don't the slow cooker to cook TOO slow, you can actually just add some tomato puree or a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and cut a couple hours off the cook time.\n\nAnd if you are looking for a thicker pot roast or beef stew, there are some options. Not my first choice, but you can just use some corn starch slurry. A better choice would be to use a roux (equal parts butter and flour, toasted on low heat). The absolute easiest thickener is some instant mashed potatoes. Just sprinkle some flakes in, mix, give it a couple minutes and check the thickness.\n\nNow for my favorite secret ingredient. For some incredibly savory sauce, add a little oyster sauce. It's not at all as fish, like you would expect. Incredibly, it's like a very savory roast chicken.\n\nAnd obviously, season to taste. Some people like it simple, some like it fancy. That's up to you.\n\nI hope I actually helped you in some way, instead of coming off rude and smarmy.",

If your crock doesn't have this option then just cube up your chuck roast and season liberally on all sides, then sear the shit out of it in a skillet to get a deep caramelization on the meat. This reaction caused by the heat and the fat is what gives things a \"meaty\" flavor. You are going to want to deglaze the pan using some broth before it all goes into your crock to slow cook. This one extra step will take your meal from C to at least B+. You may also want to consider some herbs like bayleaf, thyme, sage, rosemary, etc. If you want a thicker, gravy-like consistency you can make a slurry using a tbsp of corn starch mixed with cold water, then add to your hot broth. It will thicken noticably very fast so stir it a bit. Once it's boiling or at a heavy simmer you will know it's at maximum thickness for the starch you used.",

I do basically the same thing he does and it\u2019s always been amazing. One tweak I\u2019ve added is putting some tomato sauce, beef bone broth, and jalape\u00f1os in a blender and adding that for the broth. Seems to add some heartiness and a nice kick to the meal. \n\nI frickin love pot roast. I\u2019ll have leftovers for days. My local grocery store also offers $2 fresh French bread, perfect for dipping in that broth.",

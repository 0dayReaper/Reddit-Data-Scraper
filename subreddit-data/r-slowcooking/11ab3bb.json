Brown the beef to sear the edges if you want, then toss in pot on high all day. (How I do it) \n\nRed beans &amp; rice. Beef sausage, chopped up. Can or two of red beans. Chicken stock. 1-2 cups rice of choice, either cooked and added at the end, or tossed in with extra broth. Only needs to cook for a couple hours. I tend to sear my sausage first. Garnish with green onion.  \n\n\u201cItalian\u201d chicken. Chicken breasts, chicken stock, and Italian seasonings. Bonus points if you get the better than bouillon Italian herb paste. You can do low moisture and then shred it if you want, or High moisture and drain after. Good with pasta. Can drain and toss with red sauce. \n\nChicken pasta. Chicken, chopped up (doesn\u2019t have to be cooked of course). Bag of frozen spinach. Chicken broth. Garlic. Gluten free penne pasta (I like protein ones). This is best in a pressure cooker but can slow cook so long as you keep an eye on it. Some pastas will turn to mush faster than others. \n\nI also like to put chicken and rice in like 3x or more the moisture the rice needs, to make a sort of congee like porridge.",

I normally use broths for liquid. If I throw in a brisket, I'll add liquid smoke or soy with seasonings. If I do a soup, I'll judge cooking time differences as to when I add veggies because I don't like a pot of mush lol. I love slow-cooked potato soup and I don't always add dairy. Also, experiment cooking your meat with beer, a good wine or some recipes have called for a can of soda lol. You're only limited by a lack of imagination!",

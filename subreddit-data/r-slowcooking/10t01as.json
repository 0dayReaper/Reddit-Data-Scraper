I've looked in all sorts of North American foods stores and online retailers, every major and smaller grocer I go into and online, it's just not achievable right now. And I'm just not going to pay $40+ in shipping alone to get three sauce packets sent to me from North America off eBay. \n\nIs there a breakdown of ingredients I could use instead of that? Surely something like that exists?",

There's a guy on eBay called [Shanez Jerkyz &amp; Spicez](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/321907608582?mkcid=16&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=705-154756-20017-0&amp;ssspo=PtlGfXy2QBO&amp;sssrc=2349624&amp;ssuid=pve-lpumRCW&amp;var=&amp;widget_ver=artemis&amp;media=COPY) and that's where I bought ranch powder. It is expensive for what you get but it's the most reliable way to get ranch powder. I'd recommend picking up some KFC style salt too. Anyways for the au jus, you can just use powdered gravy or gravy granules. Go easy on the butter. Good luck!",

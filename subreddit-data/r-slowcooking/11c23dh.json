It's so embarrassing because irl people think I'm a good cook but really I'm just a humble one who just makes food I like in the style I want to.\n\nYou could easily customize this with a different meat protein or veg it with mushrooms and peppers or heck even make your homemade fajita seasoning and brown the meat before hand. Have fun with it!\n\nAs always, despite my harsh tone on the \" eeew, why didja make that in the slow cooker\" crowd I share  my recipes here  in the hopes people would consider it more of a suggestion rather than do it my way. I posted the disclaimer because I'm so freaking tired of the Whydidja crowd commenting on I shouldn't have made it in the slow cooker. \n\n\nI mean, I like cooking but between prep, babysitting the food and clean up, I got better things to do which is why I love my slow cooker and make so many things in it. I know there's a lot of people like me here who want a tasty meal with minimal fuss so I share my reasonable successes to inspire.\n\nWell except my Zuni Cafe style chicken. That I will prep and work for because it's so freaking good. But that's an oven recipe.",

            "comment": "Cooking notes:\n\nFor the \"shoulda cooked it on the stove, oven, air fryer so this is gross and not \" authentic enough for me\" crowd: \n\nDon't care really about your thoughts or opinions, it's a slow cooking subreddit, got to shitty food porn if you want to bitch about it. \n\nFor my slow cooking people. It tasted great. I wanted a crisp pepper but wanted to do anything else but babysit food cooking today. While this cooked in the slow cooker , I did a spin class, a strength toning class, crochet, did a load of laundry, took a nap, wrote a paper and played four games of solitaire. So the it's not authentic crowd can bite my lily white tuckus.\n\nYou could do this all day but your peppers won't be crisp and the meat kind of shredded. I'd be fine with that too, but I wanted both freedom from babysitting food and crisp peppers.\n\nAlso the broiler thing is totally optional. Sure, like browning before slow cooking it's going to yield a better result probably but I'm okay with being lazy.\n\nAlso you could serve this in tortillas, I prefer rice. \n\nHappy slow cooking!",

            "comment": "Supermarket had half off the preprepared fajita steak and vegetable packet this week. Such a good deal I bought it.  Here's a rough recipe. Estimated servings about 3.5.\n\n1lb top round or sirloin - honestly didn't see what type it was it was pre sliced so good enough\n\n1/2 yellow pepper sliced\n1 whole red pepper sliced \n1/2 red onion sliced\n1/2 yellow onion sliced\nOptional - green peppers disagree with me so I composted those but you could add 1/2 of it \n1 fajita seasoning pack\n\nCooked rice for serving\nPut onions and steak in slow cooker. ( 3-4 quart size)   in a small bowl put your fajita seasoning packet in.  add 1/4 cup water to seasoning and stir until it seems mixed and dissolved. Pour over steak and onions \n\nCook on low for five to seven hours. Mine went until 7 hour mark so the meat was more \"shreddy\" but I'm a home cook and don't care about that. If you do you probably want to check it at five hours.  remove steak with tongs and keep warm. Add your peppers to slow cooker and turn to high. Make your rice. My rice cooker  takes twenty minutes. \n\nOptional - during last five minutes of waiting for your rice preheat broiler to 500 and put your meat under it for about 3-5 minutes to brown and char it. Then stir it back into your pepper mixture .\n\nSpoon rice in a bowl. Top with peppers and steak and a little of the juice.add your favorite fajita toppings. \n\nSee next comments for tasting and cooking notes.",

My dogs licked some up and then had people food poops all over my apartment. So you can be very happy you noticed! And yes, it could be a huge problem. But it sounds like other people have been luckier than I was.",

The Curtain was open on the door so I watched him walk over to the stove, knock the soup onto the floor and eat all of it.  He promptly pooped all over the floor while not breaking eye contact with me.  I was knocking on the door and yelling for him to stop - he knew what he was doing. Sneaky sneak.",

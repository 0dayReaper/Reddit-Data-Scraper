Please help me plan 5 days of slow cooker meals, whether cooked day-of or involving bulk cooking, to help make feeding 3 adults and 1 kid easier. Ideally, I'm looking for recipes that take 20 minutes or less to get assembled and in the cooker OR less than 20 minutes to assemble into a meal from previously prepped constituent parts. No major food allergies present. \n\nHelp. Please. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAddendum: I have one 6qt digital slow cooker and two 4qt analog cookers.",

(And just needs a couple of optional toppings and a bottle of hot sauce set out lets others in the house tailor it to their personal preferences.)\nSome ground beef, open a can of tomatoes, a can of beans.  Use a packet of chili seasoning if you don't fell like measuring out your own spices. Call it a day.\nLeftover chili goes on baked potatoes another day. \n\nPulled pork or a chopped beef roast, like others have posted. Can be put in tacos, on sliders, in Mac &amp; cheese....  I tend to eat it with potatoes &amp; veggies one day and then mix leftovers into one of the above a second day. \n\nStew: some beef, potatoes, carrots, topped with dried onion soup mix and/or cream of mushroom soup. \n\nSloppy joes: ground beef, and basically a barbecue sauce (if you have a preferred product or recipe).  I add onion and matchstick carrots to mine to get some vegetable in there.  My kid always just ate it with a spoon because she didn't like the hamburger bun.\n\nSome people think this is weird and it isn't slow cooking, but my kid loves it: boxed or easy Mac, diced ham (usually precooked in the store), peas.  Make the box then just throw in the other stuff.  Kind of a stove top version of a 70s casserole,haha.\n\nHang in there!",

Carnitas - literally cover a pork shoulder in salt and pepper and throw a roughly chopped onion and jalape\u00f1o into the crockpot and let it go for 8 hours or whatever til it shreds with a fork. Broil if you want at the end to crisp up the skin. \n2. Frijoles charros (check out the serious eats recipe) - an onion, some garlic, half a pack of bacon, diced, a jalape\u00f1o or some chipotle pur\u00e9e, and a few cans of beans (I usually do 2 cans pinto and 1 can cannellini) - let it go for 4 hours or whatever. Thicken by taking some out and blending it and adding it back in. ADD CARNITAS IN from previous recipe and both will go a long way. \n3. Beef Barbacoa - lots of ingredients but it\u2019s awesome and super easy. Blend a couple limes worth of juice with an oranges worth of juice, some chipotle pur\u00e9e (use half of a can in this recipe and the beans above!), some garlic, and some oregano, cumin, and ACV. Sear beef chuck roast on half of the outside and dump all that stuff on top. Let it go 8 hours or til it shreds easily with a fork. Awesome for tacos, quesadillas, with potatoes, whatever. \n\nThose 3 recipes can easily feed 5-10 people each depending on the size of your pork shoulder and chuck roast, usually with plenty of leftovers. All take less than 20 mins prep.",

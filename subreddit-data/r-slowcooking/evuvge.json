That's why you shouldn't use a slow cooker for hunks of frozen meat, because it doesn't push it through that range quickly enough. Same with thawing things on a room temperature counter over night. \n\nYou're right that some things need to get up to 160/165, like chicken, pork, eggs, etc, but I think that's more for thoroughly cooking it and less the danger of bacteria.*\n\nEdit, that was dumb, that's for thoroughly cooking it and less the danger of bacteria proliferation at holding for long periods. You need to hit 160, but once it's there you can let it cool a bit and it can hang out at any temp above 145 until you're ready to serve it. It doesn't need to *stay* at 160.",

Occasionally I'll buy a pack and when I pick a breast up it will have thick juice run off it instead of a thin little bit.  Is it just releasing the solution?  It's off-putting.  When I first moved out on my own chicken didn't do that but the breasts we're about 1/3-1/2 the size they are now so maybe it's that solution.  I wish they would stop.",

But he also mentioned that in 3rd world countries without clean water, things like ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease are practically nonexistent.

She'll leave raw meat on the counter \"to thaw\" and will finally cook it for dinner the next day - a full 24 hours later. And once she cooks, she'll leave it out overnight and then decide to put the 18+ hours old leftovers into the fridge. So if you eat her leftovers, you're eating meat that hasn't been held at a proper temperature for two days or more. It drives me crazy but God forbid I ever throw any of it away. It turns into a personal attack on the quality of her cooking, rather than me not wanting our family to be hospitalized with food poisoning. I just flat out refuse to eat what she makes. Sorry mil, I value my health and safety and some chicken and rice just isn't worth a full day camping in the bathroom.",

She adds all of this oil because she's convinced that pasta sticks together no matter what, and that for some reason oil (THAT DOES NOT MIX WITH WATER, BTW) will magically coat the noodles to make them not stick together while simultaneously not stick to the noodles in order to let the noodles absorb the water. She breaks an entire pound of spaghetti in half and puts it in this tiny pot. She can't figure out that the actual reason her spaghetti sticks together is because she packs way too much spaghetti into a way too small pot.\n\nFurthermore, the night I saw that she did this, she was cooking for extra people, so she was making more. She literally tried to pack a whole 32oz box of spaghetti into a 3 qt pot. I stopped her and told her this was never going to work, and asked why she didn't just use the big pot. \"It takes too long to boil\".\n\nShe had the stove set to 6. Out of 10. WHAT THE FUCK, WOMAN! You can barely boil water at 6, no wonder it takes you so goddamn long to cook spaghetti.\n\nBut of course my suggestion of not using oil because it's useless, using a bigger pot, and using high heat to boil water was met with scoffs and eye rolls.\n\nJesus christ, do these people never realize that cooking something like spaghetti shouldn't be an ordeal? Do they wonder why it takes them three times longer to cook it than the package says it should???",

Only a few degrees below will necessitate cook times that are 2 or 3x higher, making large errors more likely.",

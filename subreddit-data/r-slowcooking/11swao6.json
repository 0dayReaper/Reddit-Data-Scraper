Like, zilch man.\n\nI tried.\n\nI think you're conflating a couple ideas, honestly. First being that cooking doesn't kill toxins produced during bacteria feeding/replication, and the second being that bacteria can&amp;will grow in your food during the time it moves from 40F - 140F (in either direction). It's reasonable to draw some incorrect conclusions about how these two things interoperate.\n\nBut the evidence I find basically all says the moment something hits 145F, all bacteria will ebe dead within seconds. At 165F, it's instant. Any bacteria accumulated from when the ingredients came from the fridge til it hits 145 are dead and gone. No magical bacteria will form in that dish, ever again, as long as it's above 145 forever. No new bacterial toxins will develop -- just whatever was produced by the bacteria that existed on the food before and til the dish hit 145F.\n\nAnyway, I welcome your evidence. But all I can find is weekend-chef-blogs and a Malaysian paper that makes a totally arbitrary conclusion from an FDA report (I read both), and then mislinks the report.",

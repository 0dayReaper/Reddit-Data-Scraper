Used a meat thermometer in the middle of the pot. Temp says 72 degrees Celcius (161 Fahrenheit). Is this hot enough?",

                    "comment": "This is the correct answer. The 165 temperature is an INTERNAL temperature when all pathogens are killed almost instantly. Pathogens die at lower temperature, but it takes longer.  Meat's different parts (eg, the enzymes in muscles, fat, connective tissues) each chemically reacts at temperatures below 165 - the most obvious being fat melting, connective tissues converting to collagen, and muscles denaturing to lose water and get tougher. Normal fast cooking, you quickly cook to 165 and then stop. One of the main points of slow cooking is cooking at a lower temperature for longer - so you denature proteins slower so that they don't lose water so quickly, slick collgen remains in the tissue, etc.  Conversely, you can take advantage of the very long cooking times to do the opposite - remove a lot of the connective tissues/fats of cheap cuts so that the remaining muscle fibers are more palatable (eg, fall-off-the-bone stews). But if you heat externally at 165 for long periods of time, the whole dish will eventually be 165 inside and out and you will denature/destroy everything in your meal - all the fat and connective tissue will be rendered, all vegetable matter will fall apart into soup, and the remaining muscle fibers will be denatured tough/stringy/dry.\n\n[https://amazingribs.com/technique-and-science/cooking-science/science-of-slow-cookers/](https://amazingribs.com/technique-and-science/cooking-science/science-of-slow-cookers/)\n\nIf you want to read the a great culinary science book,  Harold McGee's \"On Food and Cooking\" is required reading at the Culinary Institute of America.",

Their recommended temperature for a chicken breast is 145, but you're holding it at that temperature for (minimum) 1 hour.",

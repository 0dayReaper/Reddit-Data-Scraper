    "postText": "I will post a proper recipe and method in the morning. However this follows similar to my previous Coconut Chicken Curry recipe which gained nearly a thousand likes.\n\nHere I am showing how simple it is to modify and upscale. We doubled the amount of spice mix, onion, chilli and ginger. Added mushrooms and peppers alongside the chicken thighs and used two tins of coconut milk and a tin of chopped tomatoes instead of coconut cream.\n\nI especially liked that the chicken seemed to come into its own on this one and the spice was in my opinion perfectly balanced with the flavour.",

            "comment": "This does require some pre preparation but it is completely worth it\n\n\nFirst of all in an airtight container add:\n\n\n3 tbsp Smoked Sweet Paprika\n\n\n4 tbsp Hot Curry powder\n\n\n3 tbsp Cumin\n\n\n3 tbsp Coriander\n\n\n3 tbsp Turmeric\n\n\n1 tbsp Garam Masala\n\n\n\nYou can prepare these yourself or buy shop bought. There is a flavour difference however shop bought is fine. Once they are in the container put the lid on and shake until well mixed.\n\n\nWhat you need for this recipe:\n\n\n\n500-600 grams of boneless chicken thighs\n\n400g Mushrooms\n\n\n2 red peppers\n\n\n800g coconut milk (2 tins)\n\n\n400g tinned Tomatoes\n\n\n4  medium onions finely diced\n\n\n2 red chilli finely diced with seeds left in\n\n\n6 cloves of garlic minced\n\n\n3 thumb sized piece of ginger peeled and grated.\n\n\n4 tablespoons of tomato puree\n\n\n1 tbsp balsamic vinegar\n\n\n2 tbsp of coconut oil or ghee\n\n\n4 tbsp of your preprepared spice mix\n\n\n1 cinnamon stick\n\n\n2 Bay leaves\n\n\nSalt to taste\n\n\nBefore you put things in the slow cooker the most important step is to bring out the flavours of the aromatics and spices so get a frying pan on a medium heat, add your oil of choice and add your onions, chilli, garlic and ginger stir and scrape so you don't burn anything. When your onions are golden brown add your spice mix.\n\n\nCook this whilst stirring and scraping for about a minute before adding your tomato puree. Cook for another 1-2 minutes. Add your balsamic vinegar and scrape any residue into the spice mix. Add your chicken, mushrooms and peppers to this pan and get it covered in your spice base. Add everything to the slow cooker with the coconut milk, tinned tomatoes, cinnamon stick and Bay leaves.\n\n\nCook on low for 5-6 hours. \n\n\nServe with rice\n\n\nIf you like your gravy thicker you have two options, add cornflour and water paste or transfer to a pan and cook on low to reduce.",

Washing rice adds water to your ratio.\n\nSecondly forget 2:1 or 3:1 for cups of water to rice. \n\nTake one cup of rice and put it in your pan. Add 1.5 cups of cold water.\n\n\n Put the heat to high until the waters frothy and bubbling on top.\n\n\n Put the lid on and turn the heat all the way down to low. Set a timer for 12 minutes. \n\n\nOnce the timer ends take the pan off the heat for ten minutes.\n\nAfter ten minutes the rice is cooked and ready to serve.\n\n\nDo not take the lid off at all once it's on until the rice is ready.",

            "comment": "Kosher Brisket \n\nIngredients\n\n4 lbs. beef brisket up to 5 lbs.\n\n2 tbsp flavorless oil like canola, avocado, vegetable, or sunflower seed.\n\nsalt &amp; pepper to taste\n\n1 red onion quartered\n\n1 fennel quartered\n\n2 carrots peeled and cut into 2 inch chunks\n\n2 stalks celery cut into 2 inch chunks\n\n2 sprigs rosemary\n\n8 cloves garlic peeled\n\n2 dried bay leaves\n\n2-3 cups red wine\n\n1 tbsp soy sauce aminios, or just more salt\n\n1 jalape\u00f1o optional\n\nInstructions\n\nHeat the oil in a heavy bottom saut\u00e9 pan, dutch oven, or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Season the brisket with salt and pepper. Sear the brisket, flipping once, just until golden brown. Transfer to your slow cooker.\nAdd the onion, fennel, carrots, celery, rosemary, garlic, bay leaves, red wine, and soy sauce/aminos/salt to your slow cooker. Cover and cook on low until tender, 6-8 hours. Let rest for 20 minutes with the slow cooker on warm.\nNotes\nMake sure you season well and sear the brisket before slow cooking. Searing the brisket helps keep it juicy and locks in flavor!\nLeave the soft fat on the brisket. The fat adds flavor and tenderness, especially the fat that is marbled inside the cut of meat. Trim off the hard fat.",

Contrary to popular belief, this doesn\u2019t refer to the look of the sunflower, but the solar tracking it displays every dayy during most of its growth period.",

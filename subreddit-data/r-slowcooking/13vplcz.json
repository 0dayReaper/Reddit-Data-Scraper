I\u2019ve prepped this in 10 minutes. \n\n1.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken breast\n1 large onion, chopped\n1lb baby cut carrots, cut in thirds\n1lb celery, chopped\n6 cups water \n2Tbs Better than bouillon chicken\n1Tbs dried thyme leaves\n1/2 cup rice\n\nChicken may be whole or cut into small cubes. Add all ingredients except rice to the crock pot and cook on low for 6 hours. If chicken was added whole, remove and shred, then return to the pot. Add rice 30 min before serving. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know how long it takes for the chicken to cook - I always prep this in the morning for dinner. I pre-cut my chicken when I buy it because I use it a lot in soups, stews, stir fry, etc, and find that\u2019s the part of week-day cooking I like least.  I can say that this time is sufficient to cook pre-cut chicken from frozen. \n\nI also use a lot of chicken and beef broth, and have switched to BTB because it is more cost effective and doesn\u2019t take up as much room in the fridge.  It also doesn\u2019t go bad as quickly as broth, so I can get a big jar from Costco.",

            "comment": "I actually \"roast\"  chicken breasts or turkey loin so it's sliceable for salads/sandwiches.  Butter/Tika Masala is good also. Any quick slow cooker google search will get you decent results. \n\nPoach: ( I like to do this in olive oil but you could do it water, or broth.)\n\nLightly season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. If using for sandwiches you can add dried herbs or fresh l. If meal prep I just lightly salt/pepper it.  put in slow cooker. Pour 1/4 -1/2 cup over chicken. I pour  enough oil  in there to bring it up to halfway to chicken sides but not cover it. If you want you can throw in a few cloves of garlic and a bay leaf or two. Cook on high until chicken reaches internal temp of 165 F or until no longer pink.  This is about 2-1/2- 3 hours on my 3 quart Hamilton beach slow cooker \n\nTo\" roast\"  I create a rack on the bottom of my slow cooker with carrots and onions. Layer  in the seasoned chicken on top and pour about 1/4- cup water, over it Sometimes to create dinner I'll wrap potato in aluminum foil and put that on top of chicken. Turn on high and roast it until done usually about 2-3 hours.\n\nOne unusual thing I did with tofu and chicken breast is \" smoke it\" with some tea. It turned out really good with both. I don't have time to get  that process typed out but I will after work today if you like.",

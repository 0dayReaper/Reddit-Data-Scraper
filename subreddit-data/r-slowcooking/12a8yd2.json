    "postText": "I\u2019m a college student with a decent spice rack, but I was scouring this Reddit page for an easy recipe to start breaking in my slow cooker. I settled on The Mississippi pot roast recipe. It sounds fairly easy and I grabbed the ingredients for it today. I was wondering if you had any pro tips on how to elevate the flavor a little bit because I heard it can be kind of bland sometimes. \n\nI was thinking of using some thyme, red pepper flakes, and Worcestershire. Let me know if that is a bad idea. I plan on serving it alongside some mashed potatoes and green beans as well.",

If you have an onion and button mushrooms layer the bottom with those before putting the meat in, will not disappoint. As for your other ingredients I\u2019d pass but I don\u2019t see how they could hurt anything.",

Last thing I do is add onion and replace the au jus/gravy mix with onion soup mix. Small changes, but I\u2019d never describe the outcome as bland. Hope it helps \u2014 good on you for taking time to cook for yourself while in school! I hope it turns out awesome for ya!",

I\u2019ve heard that other people feel it could do without the butter, but they never explained why. Is it simply because it ends up being too buttery? Lol",

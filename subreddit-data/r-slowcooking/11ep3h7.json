The sauce will blend with it and the chicken to create a mouth watering tasty dish that you will clean up with your tongue.\n\nI suggest Brussels sprouts in Indian sauces BC it adds in a bit of bitterness that contrasts very nicely with the spices. And is fine if fresh or cold, no cutting or dicing needed, just toss them in. Squash is another go to that adds to this sort of thing well, again no need to peel just cut it up and toss it in. The skin will practically melt into the sauce and the seeds can be toasted and spread over the dish as a flavorful and crunchy garnish for no extra cost. \n\nThe usual assortment of onions, tomatoes, celery, cabbage, carrots, what have you as either fresh or frozen will help stretch the chicken and make a more interesting tasting and feeling dish.",

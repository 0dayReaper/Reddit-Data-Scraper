I cooked on high for 4 hours, switched to low for 1 hour. Remove the chicken, shred with two forks, add back to slow cooker and mix everything together. I served this with lettuce, tomato, avocado, sour cream and cheese, white rice on the side. It was a perfect meal after a busy day.",

Check with a meat thermometer until it is ~161 or so then let it rest. It should probably take 4-6 hours unless the pieces are gigantic.\n\nAs far as waterlogged, I don't know what to say except add less liquid. Chicken breasts should not be adding much liquid on their own.\n\nAs far as tasteless, chicken does not have a strong flavor by itself. However much seasoning you are using, use more. Which seasonings will depend on what exactly you are cooking, but if it is tasteless you need more.",

In the slow cooker for about four hours, shred with a fork. \n\nThen it's just cheese on tortilla, as much chicken mixture as you want, more cheese, top with tortilla, cook on both sides, slice into wedges and serve with sour cream and guacamole \n\nThe shredded chicken keeps well in the fridge so you can just keep it around for a quick quesadilla dinner.",

It's commonly used to turn solid cheese into cheese sauce. Searching \"sodium citrate cheese sauce\" will yield many wonderful recipes. Coincidentally, if you take the numbers out of the chemical formula, you get NaCHO!",

It's like 90% sodium citrate I swear (and 0% cheese!)  tastes nasty on its own but makes a really smooth cheese sauce and as long as you don't use too much, it doesn't affect the taste.\n\nIn fact that's how I always make mac&amp;cheese (regular stovetop version - not slowcooker.  sorry...)  While you're boiling the macaroni, microwave a thick slice of velveeta with about 1/2 cup of milk (30 seconds at a time, whisk between heating cycles until it's all melted and incorporated into the milk).  Then add about 3/4 of a cup of grated cheddar and whisk that in until it forms a thick cheese sauce.\n\nOnce the macaroni is cooked, drain it but don't shake all the water out.  You want a little of that starchy pasta water still clinging to the noodles.  Stir in the cheese sauce and it comes out super creamy and gooey every time.  As long as you don't use a lot of velveeta, you won't get any weird processed-cheese flavors either.\n\nI'd do the same for your nacho cheese sauce.  slice of velveeta, milk, grated cheese.  Add a can of Rotel tomatoes or diced pickled jalapenos or even some of your favorite jarred salsa and you're good to go.",

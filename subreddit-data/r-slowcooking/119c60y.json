    "postText": "I have done this dinner with the recommended vegan option and also with  turkey/chicken cutlet.\n Sometimes I make it with sliced russet  potato instead of sweet  or if using sweet  forgo the candied  part as I hate sweet potato casserole. I usually just brush the potato option  with butter and sprinkle with  salt, pepper and thyme or other seasonings.  Author Kathy Hester. \n\nALL-IN-ONE THANKSGIVING DINNER *OIL-FREE *SOY-FREE OPTION* *GLUTEN-FREE OPTION** You may not want to go through all of the trouble of making a big holiday meal if you\u2019re cooking for only one or two. This three-layered dinner takes no time to put together and is a complete Thanksgiving dinner. All that\u2019s missing is the pumpkin pie!\n\n FOR THE BOTTOM LAYER (TEMPEH AND GRAVY):\n\n 1 cup (235 ml) water \n\n2 tablespoons (14 g) Golden Veggie Bouillon Powder (page 26) \n\nPinch each salt and pepper \n\n8 ounces (225 g) tempeh (*or seitan for soy-free), cut into 2 slices \n\n1 to 2 tablespoons (8 to 16 g) flour (**or gluten-free thickener)\n\n FOR THE MIDDLE LAYER (STUFFING):\n\n 1 1/2 cups (42 g) packaged vegan stuffing (**or gluten-free stuffing) \n\n1/2 cup (120 ml) water\n\n 1/4 cup (28 g) minced cranberries or pecans \n\nFOR THE TOP LAYER (CANDIED SWEET POTATOES):\n\n1 medium sweet potato, cut into thick rounds\n\n 1 tablespoon (15 g) brown sugar\n\n 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon\n\n  Pinch salt \n\nTear off 2 pieces of parchment paper or aluminum foil big enough to make an enclosed packet in the slow cooker. You will use these for the middle and top layers. Set aside.\n\n Add the water, Golden Veggie Bouillon Powder, salt, and pepper to the slow cooker and mix. \n\nAdd the tempeh (or seitan). Set the flour aside for use right before serving. \n\nIn a bowl, mix the stuffing ingredients. Transfer the mixture to the middle of one of the pieces of parchment and close it up so it will fit in the slow cooker. \n\nPlace on top of the tempeh.\n\n Spread out the other piece of parchment and arrange the sweet potato slices on it and sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon, and salt. (Non sweet option, use salt, pepper and herb of choice plus a little olive oil or butter)  You may need to stack them so they will fit in the slow cooker: close up this package, place it on top of the stuffing packet, and replace the lid.\n\n Cook on low for 7 to 9 hours (or 3 hours on high). Remove the top two packets and set aside. Turn the slow cooker to high, remove the tempeh, and set aside. \n\nWhisk in the flour and set the tempeh back in. The gravy should thicken up enough while you plate up the potatoes and stuffing. Add a little more flour if needed. Place the tempeh on the plates and cover with gravy and stuffing.",

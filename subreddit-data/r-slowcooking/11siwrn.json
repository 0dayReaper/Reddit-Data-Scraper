You can add dried onion or green onions for texture too. Mix with mayonnaise (dressing) or sour cream (sour cream for dip texture) or powdered milk/buttermilk for the dry kind you put on Mississippi roasts usually. My family makes it in a mason jar. Better than the premix.",

In the United States, they may also be called **Greek golden pepperoncini peppers** or **mild golden Salonika peppers**.\"\n\nI wouldn't use banana peppers as another commenter advised, they do not taste the same. Amazon is a possibility, but I would say since you're in Australia they are probably just called something else as opposed to Americans using \"Pepperoncini\", so I would check your grocery store and look for any of those bold names!",

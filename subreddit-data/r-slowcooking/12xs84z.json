Do some research or the various types of smokers (mainly pellet vs charcoal) and see which one would work best for your living situation. Pellet grills are easier and will function more like a crock pot in terms of being able to set it and forget it (mostly). Then there is charcoal (my preferred method) which takes a little bit more time and patience to get down. Keep an eye out on fb market place/Craigslist as people get rid of hood smokers for pretty cheap. Then head over to r/smoking and learn about methodology and recipes.",

If your store has some big seasonal promotion, grab it (mine sells a ham for 69 cents lb if you have a $25 order otherwise so my gorgeous big  extra half-ham cost me six dollars and change). Or after the holiday stores may clear out ham at reduced prices.  I baked the ham then cut it up into chunks and slices and here is what I stashed in my freezer: twelve packages of enough ham for a dinner (probably scalloped potatoes and ham---or maybe  ham &amp; eggs Sunday breakfast); a bag of ham scraps to be Cuisinarted with sweet pickle, mixed with mayonnaise, and eaten on crackers; and a big meaty bone that will be a pot of split pea soup. And pieces of ham  skin will go to flavor pots of beans or greens. Every molecule of a ham gets used and an extra \"sale\" ham is a seasonal treasure.",

Got it kicked off with the soup for my first one.    \n\n\nI thought it was really good but I under-seasoned it.  Definitely going to do it again and will probably add some chili flakes.",

One of the last recipes I had made was a chicken tortellini soup \u2014 it was really good and my bf still asks for it but somehow I didn\u2019t save the recipe \u2014 but I think this might be it!",

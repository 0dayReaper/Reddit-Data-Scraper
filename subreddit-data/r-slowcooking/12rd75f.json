    "postText": "I just slow cooked a Beef Loin Roast with a beef broth, Lipton onion soup mix, onion powder, garlic powder and Mrs. Dash mixture which was poured over the roast.\n\nI cooked it on low for just under 8 hours in a very basic crock pot and the outer layer was pretty an inedibly hard crust, which really felt like a waste of food.\n\nWhat can I do to avoid repeating this?",

            "comment": "Is this a Tenderloin? 8 hours sounds way too long. A Rib Roast? Maybe on the time then. More beef broth, enough to just cover the meat would prevent any one part of it drying out but it\u2019s not going to brown then either. You could try leaving only perhaps the top inch exposed. You could also try turning the roast over at perhaps 3/4 of cook time.",

    "postText": "Hi there! I was hoping to find tips to making good bone broth with a rotisserie chicken carcass in the slow cooker. I\u2019ve tried a few times to cook it on low for 24 hours with a healthy splash of apple cider vinegar and still am not getting it the gelatinous, collagen filled bone broth that I can achieve in my Dutch oven on the stovetop in a fraction of the time. Can I cook it longer than 24 hours to try to see if that helps? Any tips appreciated! Thank you!",

            "comment": "To get more gelatin you gotta get picky about what parts youre using. Feet wingtips and spines are the best as they have the most joints which inherently have more to give up. For my own i use wingtips as a booster- ill buy discount packs of wings, cook them and shred the meat for something else, saving all those little bones and tips in a freezer bag. \n\nI also find that its easier to get with any form of pressure cooking. True pressure ones if you got them but instant pots and knockoffs do a good job too.",

I guess I\u2019m just confused as to why I get really good results with the same ingredients on my stovetop cooked for ~12 hours at a moderate simmer but can\u2019t accomplish anywhere close to the same results in my slow cooker at a low simmer for ~24 hours.",

Rotisserie chicken is ok for brown chicken stock but if you want a decent gelatinous stock you need to add at least fresh chicken wings. Add chicken feet for even more oomph. Having some water evaporate out will make it even better.",

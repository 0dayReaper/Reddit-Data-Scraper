            "comment": "Here\u2019s my recipe:\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n-\t2 large (or 3 small or medium) chicken breasts (frozen is ok)\n-\t1 (15 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes (do not drain)\n-\t1 (19 ounce) can enchilada sauce (Old El Paso mild is my favorite)\n-\t1 medium onion, chopped\n-\t1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chile peppers\n-\t2+ cloves garlic, minced\n-\t4 fresh jalape\u00f1os, minced (or 4 tablespoons of jarred minced jalape\u00f1os)\n-\t5 cups water\n-\t6 teaspoons (or cube equivalent) chicken bouillon\n-\t1.5 teaspoons cumin\n-\t2 teaspoons chili powder\n-\t1/2 teaspoon salt (add more to taste)\n-\t1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n-\t1 (14 ounce) can corn (drained)\n\nDIRECTIONS\n\nPlace all ingredients, including frozen or thawed chicken breasts, in a slow cooker. Cook on low for 6 to 8 hours or on high for 3 to 4 hours. (8 hours on low is best.) About 3/4 of the way into the cooking time, remove chicken and shred. Meanwhile, allow remaining soup to cool for a bit. Use an immersion blender to very slightly blend and thicken soup. (Some chunks of vegetables, etc., should still be visible.) Add back chicken and continue to cook for the remainder of the designated time.\n\nGarnish with tortilla strips, avocado, sour cream, fresh cilantro, shredded cheese, fresh lime juice, etc. If nothing else, at least add a healthy squeeze of lime to each bowl.\n\nEta a few notes: (1) jarred minced garlic is fine if you don\u2019t have fresh; (2) jarred/pickled jalape\u00f1os are even better than fresh here; and (3) this soup freezes well.\n\nEdit #2: changed \u201c6t chicken bouillon (or cubes)\u201d to \u201c6t chicken bouillon (or cube equivalent)\u201d because cubes may be larger than a teaspoon, and you don\u2019t want this to be overly salty if using an oversized cube!",

You'd need much less time to fully cook it (for instance 6 min at 140 is a common pasteurizer temperature). Just needs to be in there long enough to have that time/temp for the whole piece .",

As far as texture of the chicken breasts, at the 6 hour mark (if cooking on low), when I remove them to shred, they\u2019re in great shape. Easy to pull apart, not dry at all\u2026 I\u2019m really happy with how the process and overall recipe have worked out.

But more or less is fine; it\u2019s really up to you.\n\nAs for the bouillon, I keep a container of powdered chicken bouillon like this one (see link below) in the kitchen at all times. I use it in place of buying or making chicken broth from scratch - so much so, that I have a dedicated teaspoon that I just leave in the container lol. One teaspoon makes one cup of broth. I believe the cube version of this brand is larger than a teaspoon, so just be sure to read the label if you\u2019re using that (this stuff is very salty). The idea is to end up with the equivalent of whatever makes six cups of broth (even though you\u2019re only adding five cups of water - that\u2019s because there\u2019s liquid in the tomatoes, enchilada sauce, etc., too).\n\nHope this helps!\n\nhttps://www.knorr.com/us/en/products/granulated-bouillon/chicken-granulated-bouillon.html",

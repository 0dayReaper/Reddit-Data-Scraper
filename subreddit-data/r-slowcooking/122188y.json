I also put a lot of mushrooms in, only used a 1/2 stick of butter, and only used a fraction of the ranch/aus jus packets. Came out amazingly.",

I live in the Netherlands and I can\u2019t find the peppers here, only online, but that costs extra. So anyone having an idea what to use instead? And with that gravy\u2026 what exactly are we talking about? If I google I get quite an variety of flavours and sizes. As for the ranch dressing (Americans really seem to love this!) I found it in the store in the taco section. It\u2019s not my favourite flavour, but I try everything at least once! \n\nMaybe anyone here from Europe and tried the recipe with substitutes?",

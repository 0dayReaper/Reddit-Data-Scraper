I also like to add a little bacon grease to the pan whenever cooking pork.  Apply your favorite dry rub to the outside of the pork then get it browned on all sides.  Once the meat has been seared transfer it to the slow cooker.  Pour in your tea, around the edge and not directly over the meat, until the liquid level reaches about half way to the top of the meat.  We're cooking pork, not trying to drown it.  If you're not allergic to sugar add some honey and brown sugar to the top.  Close the lid, set the dial to low, wait about 6 to 8 hours.",

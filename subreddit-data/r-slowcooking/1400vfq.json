            "comment": "\n4 tablespoons bacon grease \n\n2 30oz bags shredded hashbrowns \n\n1.5 lbs of pulled chicken breast (i used half a package of Costco pulled breast meat) \n\n1 12oz bottle Frank's hot sauce \n\n1 stick of butter \n\n1 tablespoon Better Than Bullion chicken \n\n1 tablespoon Better Than Bullion saut\u00e9ed onions \n\n1 tablespoon of powdered chicken bullion \n\n3/4 cup hot water \n\n2 tablespoons Mrs Dash seasoning \n\n1 tablespoon lemon pepper seasoning \n\n1 teaspoon chipotle powder \n\n2 teaspoons granulated garlic\n\n\n\n\nAdd the bacon grease to the bottom of the slow cooker and turn on high to allow the grease to melt and heat up.\nIn a saucepan add the Frank's, butter, bullions, water, and seasonings and cook on medium-high until it begins to bubble then turn down to medium-low and simmer for 5-10 minutes stirring often until everything is blended and reduces a little bit.\nAdd 1 bag of the hashbrowns and spread over the bottom of the slow cooker then spread the pulled chicken. Push down everything so it's packed on the bottom and the chicken makes a solid layer. \nPork all but 1/2 cup of the sauce on the chicken then add the other bag of hashbrowns, again pushing everything down. \nTop with remaining sauce and cook on low for 5 hours, mixing everything up after 3 hours. \nServe with a salad or some grilled vegetables.",

It might take less than that to cook the roast, all depends on size/cooking method. \n\nWhat you want is the fat and connective tissue to breakdown. When you can pull it apart with a fork it's time to shred it up a bit and let it cook for another 30 minutes to an hour that way all the juices get in to the meat. \n\nIt could also be the cut of the meat. My roast had huge pocketsof fat throughout was almost like three pieces of meat connected by fat and tissue. You'll probably have to skim fat at the end of the process all the clear stuff needs to go, but in my experience more fat helps keep the meat tender and moist.",

My unseasoned but lightly salted pulled pork becomes so many things.  \nPulled pork sandwiches - BBQ sauce and pickles,  \nAsian wraps - hoisin sauce and Asian slaw,  \nCuban sandwiches - ham, mustard, bread, pickles,  \nCarnitas - Mexican spices and crisp the meat,   \nPozole - put remaining meat in a soup",

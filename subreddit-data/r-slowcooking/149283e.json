It will probably affect what brands/specific models are available to you. \n\nI have a very basic 6L Russell Hobbs one which I got as a gift years ago, but today runs anywhere between AUD$50-85 depending on where you get it and what sales are on. It doesn't have any fancy bells and whistles but it does what I need it to do, and I'm pretty happy with it.\n\nI will say that if I had to go out and buy a new slow cooker tomorrow, I would get something bigger. The bigger the better, honestly. Even though we're only a two person household, I like to do batch cooking since it's going to be running for hours anyway; it takes just as long to make a big batch of something as a small one.",

It can slow cook, but also pressure cook and has a ton of flexibility with programming the temperature.  I also like that the inside pot is metal and removable, so it can go on the stove to reheat leftovers.",

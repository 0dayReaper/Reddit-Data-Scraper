Set the shaped dough on a square of parchment paper. (If you're baking the bread in a pan, there's no need to use parchment.)\n\nLift it into the slow cooker:\u00a0Lift the loaf by the parchment and set it in the middle of the slow cooker. Try to flatten the parchment as much as possible against the sides of the slow cooker to prevent it from getting caught in the bread as it rises. Cover the slow cooker with its lid. (See Recipe Note.)\n\nSet the slow cooker to HIGH:\u00a0Turn on your slow cooker to the highest heat setting (or quickest time setting).\n\nBake for 1 to 2 1/2 hours:\u00a0Baking time will vary depending on your slow cooker. If this is your first time baking bread in your slow cooker, begin checking the loaf after 1 hour, then every 30 minutes, and then more frequently as it nears finishing. Record this baking time for future reference.\n\nBread is done with an internal temperature of 190\u00b0F to 200\u00b0F: Checking the internal temperature of the loaf is the best way to tell when it is done baking; a finished loaf will have an internal temperature of 190\u00b0F to 200\u00b0F. The top will also feel soft but no longer spongy, and the bottom will be hard and slightly golden.\n\nBrown the loaf under the broiler:\u00a0If a darker-colored, crustier loaf is desired, set the loaf on a rack positioned in the middle of the oven and turn on the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes. Check frequently to avoid burning the loaf.\n\nCool and slice:\u00a0Let the loaf cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.\n\n#Recipe Notes\n\nPre-Baking Rise?\u00a0You do not need to let your bread rise before baking. However, if your bread dough has been in the refrigerator, letting it warm a bit on the counter can reduce the overall cooking time.\n\n[Source](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-bread-in-the-slow-cooker-192421)",

They taste like ham hocks but have a lot more meat. Good stuff, just put them in the crock pot, a pound of beans (soaked or whatever you like), a couple of bay leaves, and some salt. Fill with water and set it on low for 6-8hrs. Pick out the bones and fat/skin and smoosh up the meat. Low for an hour or two after this if you want, but it's not necessary. Serve over rice or cornbread.",

I've made the chicken, eggs, chili and the risotto, all of which turned out nicely.  Once you get the hang of using your Instant Pot just google \"Instant Pot recipes\" or \"pressure cooker recipes\" and you'll find thousands of recipes.  My favorite things to make in my Instant Pot are roasts, stews and soups, and chicken dishes with gravies or sauces... check out the Tuscan chicken from: https://thisoldgal.com she does a great job of walking through each step... and a lot of her recipes are delicious.\n\nHope that helps!

Not a nice smelling slightly fancy kind of hand soap one would expect to be in a gift bag. A straight up generic like dial kind of hand soap. Oh and a pocket size generic hand sanitizer.",

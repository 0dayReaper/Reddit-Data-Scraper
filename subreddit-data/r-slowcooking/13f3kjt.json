    "postText": "What would be a good size of crock pot to make side dishes for 2? I saw a set of 1.5qt Pioneer Woman crockpots and wonder if that's too small, or a good size? I'm looking to make side dishes to go with my husband's grilled meats this summer...ranch red potatoes, green beans, baked beans, stuff like that.\n\nI only have a 5qt and a 6qt slow cooker, so I'm not sure just how small 1.5qt really is.\n\nThanks! Side bonus for any cool slow cooker side dish ideas that will go well with grilled meats (bbq chicken, steak, burgers, hot dogs, sausage dogs, ribs, so on...standard fare).\n\nEDIT: I MEANT To say \"best slow cooker SIZE in my title! Acckkk....damn you Reddit for not letting us edit titles!",

Broccoli and grape salad is a new one for me, but I just looked it up, and it looks interesting for sure! Thanks for your suggestions!\n\nI'll also be making things on the stove like French fries, tater tots...maybe microwaved \"baked\" potatoes or sweet potatoes. Microwaved steamed frozen veggies. \n\nWe use window unit air conditioners to cool our house, and they kinda just barely keep up with our really hot, humid summers here...and 4-6pm (dinnertime!) always seems to be the hottest part of the day too...so I go months without using our oven, and I try not to make things that involve a whole bunch of stovetop time, too.",

I bake cookies, biscuits and casseroles in mine. Just an idea for when you really want something baked but don\u2019t want to add oven heat to the house.",

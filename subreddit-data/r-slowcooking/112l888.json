I'm using homemade veggie broth to make them vegan, I usually use chicken broth, I have used beer, you can also use water to make it extra frugal. I posted my recipe card for convenience but also linked the original recipe that hasn't failed me yet so she deserves the credit!",

Since I was the oldest son I had to pick up cooking duties early on so thats how I learned but since then Ive tweaked the recipe throughout the years. First of all I'm bad with precise measurements it's one of those things where if you ask me how much of this spice/seasoning I'm just gonna have to tell you I just \"know\" how much to get it to how I like it. I like making huge batches because it can easily feed a family of 3-4 for a week especially when serving with other foods.\nI love cooking pinto and black beans. Oh also , originally we used to cook them in clay pots baaaack in the day. That was before I started cooking though but I remember mom owning a clay pot for beans when I was younger. \nSo basically 4 pounds of dry beans , rinsed and sorted. \n1 or 2 tomatoes or tomato flavored bouillon when no tomatoes. \n1 small onion.\n1 full head of garlic (all cloves peeled) \nI like my beans with a kick - so about 6 Serrano peppers or 3-4 jalape\u00f1o peppers. \nI like taking 1 bunch of cilantro and blending it with water til it's liquid and adding that to the pot.\nSometimes maybe a couple of bay leaves.\nSalt to taste. \nA lot of water in pot. Don't quote me on this because Im not sure what size the pot I regularly use is but I think it's a 16qt pot. So I fill that up with water except for like 3 inches give or take of space left in the pot. \nCover , bring to boil at highest heat. Should be relatively quickly with the lid. Once it's at a boil , reduce heat (we've always had gas stoves) to low. Like very low.  And it should just simmer for 2.5 hours or desired tenderness of beans. If there's enough water there shouldn't be a need to stir the beans because the slight boil keeps them floating around , maybe the first hour give them a stir or so. Even while simmering the lid stays on but with a slight opening to avoid boil over. If you boil it too fast at too high heat you will lose water and you might have to add extra to top up. Generally I can sorta just guess when they're done and I end up with full plump beans and just enough water left to cover all of them. They're not dry by any means, very soupy. \nTo refry beans, I just take a bunch of them with some liquid depending on desired consistency , and mash them in a pan with a potato masher. Life hack , take some of those beans and liquid and put half of that in blender for a smoother consistency but I like mine chunkier so I tend to mix the blended mix with the hand mashed portion. \nBeans are great on their own. I've grown up eating many times just refried beans with just flour tortillas. That's what's great about beans , it can really be a breakfast , lunch or dinner thing. Add potatoes / scrambled eggs , bacon, meats  ..list goes on and on. \nMexican rice always pairs well. So we always had rice and beans regularly. From there you can add the meat of your choice. You can make , tacos , Tostadas,  burritos , nachos ..etc. Personally I love Tostadas,  so refried beans with pulled pork / ground beef,  add some Mexican fresh cheese , avocado, lettuce and maybe Mexican cream too. \nCharro beans if you're familiar with that food is pretty damn good on it's own , basically bean soup but it has all the previous ingredients in the other recipe plus sausage and bacon and sliced vegetables in it and you would eat it like any other soup. \nI could go on forever just talking about beans lol if you havent noticed. They're so versatile.",

It's the yellow and red boxed/container. \n* 1 roma pear tomato aka plum tomato per cup rice.\n* 1 teaspoon of cumin per cup of rice. \n* 2 cloves of chopped garlic per cup of rice\n* Half a cup of diced / chopped onion per cup or rice.\n* Cooking oil and quarter stick of butter per cup of rice\n\n----*DIRECTIONS*----\n- Lightly fry/toast aromatics. \nIn canola/vegetable/corn oil and melted butter mixture (obviously you can substitute your oil of preference) , should be enough to coat the bottom of pan  minimum.\n* Place the aromatics garlic and onions and lightly fry in the oil. \nYou'll want the garlic light brown but not burnt and the onions to caramelize.\n* Add rice. \n* Do not rinse or wash your rice beforehand.\n* Keep frying /toasting the rice/garlic/onion mix slowly. Mix slowly with spatula or spoon but remember low low heat.\nYou want the rice to get a toasty gold/light brown mostly uniformly. Garlic may burn at this point if not careful but I sort of like the toasted/smoky garlic flavor it adds.\n- Once that's ready , get your 2 cups of water ready. \nAt this point you should have your 1 tomato / your tomato bouillon seasoning / cumin maybe put thru a blender with maybe like a quarter cup of water so it blends easily. So it should all be liquid. \nYou will get a lot of steam from the water you drop onto the pan. So at the same time ideally you want the water and your tomato/seasonings mixture dropped in or immediately right after before bringing to a boil. \n* Up the heat to high to bring to a boil , once it's boiling bring down to low heat and simmer with a lid , slightly off so there's a tiny opening unless your lids are vented.  \nYou'll want to stir a couple of times inbetween until it's done. - It shouldn't be too long but just check the rice , remove the lid and check how much water is left. Ideally you want it to be mostly dry at the top when  you poke it with your spatula or spoon , but the bottom of the pan should be slightly moist/wet. At this point you remove the lid (important because you don't want it to keep steaming and drying out) and turn off the heating element. Let jt sit and the liquid / moisture at the bottom should evaporate with the residual heat. \nIf everything turned out well you should have some delicious Mexican rice. This whole process is probably about 20 minutes or so. You can make huge batches too , I reduced the recipe down to 1 cup and it scales up perfectly. The hardest part is just not over cooking/ overdrying the rice..or burning it in the beginning lol. Apologies for all typos / formatting errors as I'm on mobile and I tried to fix as much as I could but also limited time here ha. \n\nOoh. Things you can add. You can add these things right after you add the water/ tomato/ seasoning mix. \nCan of corn.\nCan of mixed vegetables - like the corn/carrots/peas kind. \nI think I add 1 16oz can PER 2 cups of rice for the veggies. \nMy favorite. Russet potatoes. Washed but skin on / so either 1/4 in slices or cut in half longways - then cut in 1/4 in slices. \nThe potatoes get really soft and absorb the liquid really well and taste so good. The problem is this is LOADED with carbs lol which might be an issue for some. \nBut normally I do the rice plain because it's amazingly good.\n\nEdit: figured it out",

Pulled pork is one of my favorite recipes on the slowcooker. I've been known to smoke pork too but that's a whole 'nother matter. Ok so I'll make this shorter than the previous reply cuz it's getting rly late and I should've been asleep like 3 hours ago lol. \nSo where I'm at I can go to the store and buy packs of pork called carnitas which is basically pork shoulder / butt. I get the slow cooker to high only to get to temp quicker but this recipe it'll be all cooked on low for 6-8 hours. I usually gauge the doneness by sticking the meat with a fork until it starts coming apart how I like it.\nAgain , sorry for the unprecise measurements of the ingredients. \nFirst I like having a layer of aromatics like onion slices and peppers(Serrano or jalape\u00f1o) on the bottom of the slowcooker , they'll sear first and impart a nice flavor to the meat. \nI'd say like 2-3 lbs of meat , or however much you can fit , the more the better in my case because it just feeds more and lasts longer. I cut it in big chunks and throw them all in there already seasoned. I coat each chunk pretty generously with the spices and thats how I gauge how much spice to add. \nSpices list - \nGarlic powder , black pepper , achiote or anatto powder (smoked paprika is a great substitute) all these you can be pretty generous with depending on your taste buds.)\nSalt. I use not too much, because I like the other flavors to take center stage. *and* technically you could always add salt afterwards anyway. Also a couple of bay leaves , and cumin. Maybe like a teaspoon or so of the cumin...it can get overpowering but a little goes a long way. I usually add a splash of apple cider vinegar (if I had to guess maybe like 3 splashes (shots?) LOL I don't know how else to picture it. The good thing is the meat will release a lot of juice on its own after a while. Just keep checking on it and every couple of hours I usually just flip some pieces around or move them so they can cook evenly. By the end they should all be almost covered in liquid or to help with that the last hour take a fork and pull the pork apart and let it soak the juices while it finishes cooking. By the end you'll have nice juicy pulled pork or you can try and replicate \"carnitas\" if you've ever heard/ had that. The word literally translates into \"little meats\" but carnitas tacos are amazing. It's just crispy pulled pork.  Basically take some of the pulled pork and spread some on a baking tray and set your oven to broil , or just bake at 400 if you don't have a broiler , the point is to get the meat a bit crispy. Serve in tacos with cilantro / diced onions / salsa on your choice of flour or corn tortillas. I've always been a flour over corn guy but carnitas is one of those tacos you can do corn with and it tastes just as good as flour. Pork is also really inexpensive so I've taken this to potlucks and it's always been a hit. You can also add the pulled pork in whatever way you choose to keep it on the aforementioned Tostadas with the refried beans. Or flour tortillas tacos with the pulled pork / beans. Man , now I want to cook some tomorrow lol. If you're a salsa person too I have tons of great recipes too I can share but I'll have to share those another day haha. It was nice being able to share all this , hope you enjoy!",

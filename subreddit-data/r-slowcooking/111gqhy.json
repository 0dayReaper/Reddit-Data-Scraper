Seeds and ribs are removed before powdering so limited heat, also includes salt and garlic powder. This is true of most off the shelf store brands and they are called Chili Powder. You can get other powders like chipotle or pure ancho which tend to have more heat and we use these by name for heat or specific flavor/note. When we want to add real heat we use cayenne, crushed red or powdered red pepper and we call it by that so we know, HERE COMES THE HEAT!!!!!",

If it's labled chili powder you get what I linked to. Any other \"chili\" powders are labeled as the pepper is comes from, cayenne, ancho, chipotle. \n\n[Here are some of the powders I have,](https://i.imgur.com/lVZ7XIN.jpg) the one on the left is what most in the US think of when the term chili powder is used. If we want to designate heat, we use the the term cayenne.\n\nEdit: 1/2 teaspoon of \"our\" chili powder would do little to change the flavor of the dish and definitely wouldn't add heat. If I made this I'd add 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper to make it like OP did. Just different terminology.\n\nSo lets talk biscuits and gravy!!!",

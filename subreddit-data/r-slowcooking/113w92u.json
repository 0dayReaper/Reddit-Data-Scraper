Root veg also requires a bit more to cook, so keeping them low, closer to the heat source, ensures they will be done around the same time. It\u2019s also recommended to keep the meat away from the bottom of you can, just to help evenly cook.",

You want to open infrequently not just for steam buildup, but so the condensation buildup actually creates a seal around the bottom of the lid. That keeps the steam in, so you don't get too much evaporation, but it also lets steam out as needed so too much doesn't build up.",

Thank you!!! \n\nI ended up putting the meat on top, so the veggies cooked rather quickly, about 4 hours. So I actually just removed them (they\u2019re slightly overdone but I don\u2019t care). Next time I will add the veggies half way through the meats cooking time. The meat is already looking more tender than last time just from the higher heat, so thanks for your guys help. I\u2019m going to let them go about 4 hours. Really obsessed with slow cooking now! What a great group, thanks again!",

Yes, your veggies should be steamed to tenderness with no issue. Being that you are looking at 'High' for 8 to 10 hrs., you want to be sure that your loss of moisture to steam is minimal. \n\nI would not mind if OP were to add an extra .5 cup of broth before starting, just in case.",

The 3M ones are super common, and their effectiveness is certified by regulatory agencies. They contain a non-toxic indicator fluid that turns red if there's lead in whatever you tested",

Tender meat usually means overcooked vegetables and potatoes will be mush. \n\nI like to brown my meat in a saut\u00e9 pan, add it to the crock with some beef broth and let it cook for 4-6 hours depending on the cut. Then I\u2019ll add my taters and veggies and let it go another 2 hours. Slow and low, strain out the broth and reduce it with red wine \ud83c\udf77.\n\nLet it reduce by at least 1/2 and then warm it all back up in that DELICIOUS reduction. \n\nDamn Delicious my friend",

Which can be a good thing, if you plan it right.\n\nCook a whole chicken, eat a meal or two from it, pick the bones clean of meat and make chicken salad, or buffalo chicken dip. Use the carcass and whatever is left to make a chicken stock or a chicken soup.\n\nOr cook a small Turkey breast, have it as dinner, slice some for sandwiches for lunch, dice the rest and make Turkey noodle soup, or Turkey Tettrazini at the end of the week.\n\nCook up a pot of pinto beans, and have beans and rice. Later you can throw some beans into a pot of chili, or drain, mash and season some for refried beans and bean and cheese burritos. \n\nAlternately, mix some with barbecue sauce, diced onions and sliced hotdogs for \"beanie wienies\" and heat until sauce thickens. Or get creative and combine with some of your leftover chicken for a mock cassoulet.\n\nMake a pot of slow cooker mac and cheese. Stir in chopped spinach, or broccoli to change it up, or mix up some chili-mac, with leftovers from the last pot of chili you made.\n\nYou will get maximum benefit from your cooker if you have an 8\" pyrex or other brand oven proof dish for making casseroles and re heating leftovers, or individual size heat and serve containers for making and freezing single portions of leftovers.",

Pork shoulder is pretty cheap and makes a ton of food, chicken breast is healthy and light, beef is probably not worth bothering unless it's ground. For an Italian style, throw some tortellini in with a red sauce and season with garlic, then add some onion and garlic and crushed red pepper and salt for taste, then some more garlic because we're not fucking around and don't be a little bitch. Serve with a $2 baguette and try not to get laid. ",

For one it can mess with the amount of liquid required to cook properly, but mainly it's no more effort to make six meals than it would be to make 3. \n\nJust cook the whole recipe, then portion it out into tupperware at the end. Eat one portion immediately (your place will smell so good you'll have to), put one in the fridge for the next day, then freeze the rest. It's so useful having a supply of meals ready to go in the freezer, helps on those days you might otherwise resort to fast food because you don't have the time or will to cook from scratch. ",

            "comment": "Copied from an old comment:\n\nMy recipe for salsa chicken. Extremely versatile.\n\nThis stuff is amazing with everything! Seriously, I can make an entire weeks worth of meals without repeating or getting bored of it. Now, I'm doing this from memory so take that for what it is...\n\nThe optional section I just tried this last go round, so it hasn't been fully tested, but I dig it so far. Best to add in small doses to taste in step 8b.\n\nThe spices are also just a guideline. Use any mix of peppery/spicy ingredients you like. \n\nIngredients:\n\n4.5-5 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts \n\n(2) large (28oz?) jars of Safeway brand salsa verde\n\n(1) small (6oz?) can of chipolte peppers in adobo (I like Embassa)\n\n1 tbsp cumin\n\n1 tsp chipolte chili powder\n\n1 tsp chili powder \n\n1 tsp smoked paprika \n\n1 tsp cayenne pepper\n\n1/2 tsp garlic powder\n\n1/2 tsp coriander\n\nSalt and MSG to taste, but pretty generous amounts\n\nOptional:\n\n1.5 tbsp apple cider vinegar\n\n1 tbsp sweetner (sugar or substitute, I use Truvia) \n\n2 tsp soy sauce \n\n2 tsp Worcestershire\n\n1tsp sesame oil\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Mix the dry ingredients\n\n2. On a wire rack over a baking sheet, evenly coat both sides of the chicken. You'll probably have spice left over, save to add to the sauce. \n\n3a. Put in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours (I don't find any problems with leaving it uncovered) or skip this and move onto the next step\n\n3b. Remove from refrigerator and let sit out for an hour to reach room temp. \n\n4. Place the chicken in a 5qt slowcooker\n\n5. Dump the wet ingredients over the chicken (I don't bother mixing it first) and add the rest of the spice mix. You can try to stir it in, but chances are there's not much room to move anything. It'll blend in come the shredding phase.\n\n6. Cover and set to low\n\n7. Around 4 hours, check the chicken. If it doesn't shred with little effort, put it back and check back in an hour. I've had it be ready at hour 4 and not til hour 7.\n\n8a. Once the chicken is fully shredded, mix it back in with the sauce, cover and cook for another 2-3 hours.\n\n8b. This is the time to taste the sauce. I usually find that I need to add more salt/msg and if you skipped the optional ingredients, this a good time to add them if it seems a bit flat. \n\n9. If you find it too watery you can let it cook uncovered for up to an hour, mixing occasionally. I personally leave it watery and reduce the sauce when I'm cooking with it throughout the week/month.\n\n10. Either serve immediately or let cool and pack up for later use. \n\n\nThis is particularly great with eggs/omelettes. If you are going to use it for tacos/burritos, be sure to strain the meat beforehand or be prepared for a super messy eating experience. I also just toss the stuff with some broccoli and cheese for a quick delicious low carb meal. \n\nExperiment! It really does go well with damn near anything. Let me know if you find something particularly interesting to pair with.\n\nEdit: I'm on mobile and don't know why the numbering is hosed. It looks right when I edit it...\n\nEdit 2: my favorite meal is to cook a pack of ramen, drain, mix the flavor packet with the noodles, add broccoli and salsa chicken, cook on med/low to desired doneness. It's magical how good it is. I've done it without the broccoli and the flavor is off big time.",

Or breasts if that's what you have it really doesn't matter too much. \n\nAdd 16 oz jar of salsa, half a can of rinsed black beans, a packet of taco seasoning, and the sauce from a can of Chipotle peppers in Adobo sauce. Or if your too lazy to drain the sauce out you can just throw peppers and all in there. They swell up after cooking and are pretty easy to pick out before shredding.\n\nChipotles in Adobo aren't incredibly spicy, so I add some powdered cayenne in there as well. \n\nCook on low for 6-8. 30 mins before done throw in some drained corn. \n\nLet finish and stir /shred. Serve on tortillas with whatever you like on a taco. Onions, cilantro, more hot sauce, cheese, etc. \n\nI'm sure there is a better way to do this recipe but the balance between taste and how easy it is makes this my go to. Can have it cooking in like two minutes. \n\nAnd on the plus side those Chipotle peppers slow cooking in there is the best smelling thing I have ever smelled. They make the house smell fantastic.",

This will drastically improve the quality of the meat. \n\nFor a very easy recipe I wish I would have known about in college, season some pork shoulder with salt and pepper, and then brown it on all sides. Put in the crock pot and empty a jar of green chile over it. Cook it low and slow for 8 hours and then shred it and put it on brioche, tortillas, etc with Monterey Jack cheese over it. The pork will last for a week and it tastes even better day 2. ",

Browning the meat helps seal in juices and creates good flavour.\n\nGonna piggyback your comment to add some extra information for /u/BlenderBottleLol. For anyone who doesn\u2019t brown their meat but would like to, make sure the pan is hot before adding oil.  Test by holding your hand above the pan. Don\u2019t add oil if it isn\u2019t hot. Adding a tiny drop of oil is another way to test. It will sizzle if it\u2019s hot.\n\nThen make sure the oil is hot before adding the flour dusted meat. Don\u2019t overcrowd the pan, do it in batches if necessary. Lastly, don\u2019t worry if it sticks a little during the process as it will unstick in its own juices after a few minutes. It should take about 6 mins to brown all sides (might be less depending on your pan, how much you\u2019re browning etc).\n\nYou can get additional flavour by glazing the pan. Pour a swig of red wine in and let it cook up. Gently use it to remove any sticky bits. Then add that flavour bomb to your stew, casserole etc. ",

I cook a 3-4 lb. pork shoulder with a can of hominy, chicken stock, and salsa verde to create an easy pozole verde. You can also add spices and chopped chili peppers. [Look here for inspiration](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/puerco-con-chile-verde-recipe-2048971)\n\nI don't leave all the pork in the soup/stew though. I take some out and you can make tacos, enchiladas, whatever. My favorite thing to do with leftover pork is to make carnitas. You heat  up some oil in a pan and fry up that pork until a lot of the edges and strands are crispy and brown. DELICIOUS. add salt and a bunch of lime juice. I especially love a carnitas omelette. \n\n",

            "comment": "My advice is to invest in some [home automation](https://www.amazon.com/15076-24-Hour-Plug-Mechanical-Timer/dp/B002HEY300/). From time to time you're going to run into a recipe that only needs six hours to cook, but you're going to be out and about for maybe eight. Why let your food burn for two hours? Just make sure you don't mix up which settings mean on and which mean off, like I did first time using one of those.\n\nYou should also get yourself some [plastic scrapers](https://www.amazon.com/Lodge-SCRAPERPK-Durable-Scrapers-2-Pack/dp/B0039UU9UO/). They really come in handy when cleaning up. And because they're soft plastic they won't do any real damage to the crock, unlike hard metals which can chip the enamel, or abrasives that will etch away at it, giving food and contaminants more places to stick to and hide.\n\nIf you're going to start cooking food that involve big chunks of meat you should probably get a meat thermometer.\n\nEveryone has their favorite recipe sites, and mine is [AllRecipes](http://allrecipes.com/). They have a whole section devoted to [slow cooker recipes](http://allrecipes.com/recipes/253/everyday-cooking/slow-cooker/), including [healthy recipes](http://allrecipes.com/recipes/17708/everyday-cooking/slow-cooker/healthy/) that are lower in calories and salt. Even if you waren't on a diet you may want to check that section out anyway, as slow cooker recipes can sometimes be rather rich, and you may want some lighter fare.\n\nBut don't rely on them as the *only* source. If you have a favorite dish, just plug it's name and \"slow cooker\" into Google and there will probably be a recipe for it. You can make almost anything in a slow cooker, [even pizza](https://www.pillsbury.com/recipes/slow-cooker-deep-dish-pizza/0aa4eef2-bdaf-4ed5-b150-d379ff75fd57), so be ambitious.\n\nAlso, keep some \"staple\" elements in your kitchen at all times. These are things that show up in a lot of recipes, or can be used to help turn a quick something into a fuller meal. These are things that typically take an ice age before they start to go bad, but can turn a \"oh crap, I forgot to buy X for my recipe\" moment into a \"oh well, I guess I'll make Y instead\" moment (like the [No Time To Cook Chicken](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/17607/no-time-to-cook-chicken/) emergency recipe).\n\n* Cream of Chicken soup\n* Cream of Mushroom soup\n* Crushed Tomatoes\n* Onion soup mix\n* Canned beans of your preference\n* Rice\n* Noodles of your preference\n* Packet of ranch dressing mix\n* Frozen veggies (saves needing to chop them up, or as an emergency substitute for fresh ones you forgot to buy/didn't buy enough of).\n* Onions\n\nHere are some of my favorite recipes:\n\n* [Ashley's African Peanut Soup](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/217290/ashleys-african-peanut-soup/) - You need to halve the recipe, otherwise it won't fit in a normal-sized slow cooker. Because of the \"complexity\" of the recipe (adding things in at different points during cooking) it's one you'll want to be home while it cooks. If you leave out the bell peppers it'll still have some heat to it, but not burn-your-mouth-out-heat.\n* [Kalua Pig](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/24035/kalua-pig-in-a-slow-cooker/) - Deceptively simple recipe. I balked at the idea of using liquid smoke as a sort of heresy, but it turns out fantastic every time. The recipe scales easily, and you can reuse the leftovers in so many ways. Only problem is living with the smell taunting you over the 20 hours it takes to cook.\n* [Asian-Style Country Ribs](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/191199/asian-style-country-ribs/) - Great little recipe if you ever find country ribs on sale.\n* [Laura's Slow Cooker Turkey Chili](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/82768/lauras-quick-slow-cooker-turkey-chili/) - A healthier alternative to beef chili. It's got a nice kick to it, though, make no mistake.\n* [Pork Chops in the Slow Cooker](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/25150/pork-chops-for-the-slow-cooker/) - Makes a nice, but not overly thick or rich, savory brown gravy. It's just right, and if you package leftovers with the gravy the flavors bloom.\n* [Sausage Potato Bake](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/16439/sausage-potato-bake/) - This is one of those recipes I keep in the back of my head when I know I'm going to want something to eat, something maybe a little hearty, but I'm going to have minimal prep time. Chopping the potatoes is the longest part, and you can do that the night before by storing the chopped bits in water.\n* [Healthier (but still awesome) Awesome Slow Cooker Pot Roast](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/219438/healthier-but-still-awesome-awesome-slow-cooker-pot-roast/) - Everything gets cooked in the same dish, so there's less clean-up and you have a full meal ready to rock and roll. My only complaint was I thought it could use a little salt.\n* [Slow Cooker Mongolian Beef](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/195083/slow-cooker-mongolian-beef/) - Turned out much better than I expected. I thought the beef would be all ridiculously soggy, but it works. Takes a fair amount of prep, though.",

They have a herbs de provence .  \n\nAnother one I like is a spicy sausage and pork chops. This one is super easy:\n\n1 package spicy italian sausage (get it when it\u2019s on sale and freeze it)\na few pork chops \n1 jar of your favorite brand tomato sauce\n\ncook some spaghetti or pasta separately before you\u2019re ready to serve.  \n\nsprinkle some shredded mozzarella on top right before serving\n",

If you can, I recommend doing the method of putting your oatmeal in a glass/pyrex bowl in the crockpot and filling the crock around it with water.

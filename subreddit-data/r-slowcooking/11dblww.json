    "postText": "Hello! For my upcoming mealprep I really want to make some type of shredded birria style cooked pork tenderloin but I can't find a recipe that uses stovetop so I guess it's time to invest in a slow cooker.\n\nNot sure if links are allowed but I wanted something in the essence of this recipe but wasn't sure how to adjust cooking time/method for pork instead of beef (https://www.instagram.com/reel/CpIkMzjLZbY/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=).\n\nIf you have any suggestions for budget friendly slow cookers or even a recipe that gives me what I'm looking for please drop them in the comments \ud83d\ude47\ud83c\udffd.",

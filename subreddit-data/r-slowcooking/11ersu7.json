Basically, foods that will cook soft and still taste good.  No too rich.  Not too cheesy. Seasonings are good, but nothing spicier than pepper. My guts cant take it, so herbs are best for me. Allergies: tree nuts, but peanuts are fine.  Boosting protein without too much fiber would be a huge plus.  Please help me!",

Basically anything that you can slow cook to mush that will still be palatable is probably something that has a lot of soluble fiber.

The main difference, and it made a big difference, is we would add about a half a teaspoon of dried crayfish powder to really brighten the flavor. It makes a big difference, but also didn't bother someone like me who otherwise doesn't like seafood. We love to call it, \"secret ingredient,\" and I never knew what it was until I told my mom one day that I never could get the recipe quite right. Then she gave me a little Tupperware container of the stuff which I still use from to this day.",

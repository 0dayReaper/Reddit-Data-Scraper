            "comment": "I\u2019m a huge fan of Strictly Dumpling and on a recent trip to Hawaii, he ate this dish: kalua pork and cabbage over rice. As soon as I saw him eating it, I knew I had to try it for meal prep this week. I ended up combining a few different recipes for my version, and the cabbage is a lot softer than what they recommend (which I personally like, but I know some people don\u2019t). Anyway, here\u2019s how I made mine:\n\n- 3.5 lbs. pork roast\n- 1.5 tbsp. salt\n- 1 tbsp. liquid smoke\n- 1 tbsp. soy sauce\n- 2 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce\n- 1 cup water\n- 3/4 head green cabbage\n\nRub the pork with salt before putting it in the slow cooker. Mix the water, liquid smoke, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce together and pour over the pork. Cook on low for 8 hours. Remove the pork and add the chopped cabbage to the bottom of the slow cooker (don\u2019t remove any liquid). Add the pork back on top of the cabbage and cook on low for another hour. Serve over rice!\n\nBy the way, I like my gravy a little thicker so I removed the liquid towards the end of cooking from the pot and reduced it on the stove to thicken it, then added it back in. Feel free to skip this if you don\u2019t care about thicker sauce/gravy!",

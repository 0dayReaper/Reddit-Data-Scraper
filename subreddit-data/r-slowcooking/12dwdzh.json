But also essentially having two of them. I\u2019ll preface this with saying I\u2019m not a good cook at all and very inexperienced. But having the space to have two different things going at two different temps just makes things so much easier sometimes. I\u2019m so glad I have the capability to do it when the need arises. And it\u2019s easier to clean, smaller space, less to clean, don\u2019t have to bend over to do it. I also have a really nice one that has a multitude of settings, again I am inexperienced but I\u2019m pretty sure it can do a lot more than my oven can.",

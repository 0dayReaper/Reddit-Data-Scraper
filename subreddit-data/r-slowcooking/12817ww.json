Can someone help me with finding a new recipe for the slow cooker?  He does not like spicy food, or seafood, or anything vegetarian, other than that I think anything will go. \n\nMostly looking for something that won't break the bank and feeds 3-4 people.",

            "comment": "    What people often skip is desserts that old people like. Tapioca pudding (follow directions on Minute Tapioca box), Jello puddings, baked custard, bread pudding, Jello with Redi-Whip, apple crisp, cake (a mix will do) with frosting).\n    \n    Also, Goulash Soup is almost like a stew and he will like that it is so beefy and so easy to chew. In an empty slow cooker start with 1/2 cup flour, salt, and a tablespoon of paprika (sweet, not hot). Stir in 16 oz plain tomato sauce, a can of diced tomatoes, 2 lb cut-up beef,  plenty of cut-up potatoes, some cut-up onions, some cut-up carrots (not too much as carrots are sweet), then fill the crock up with water and cook on LOW for a few hours until beef is falling apart. Should be somewhere between soup and stew and very very beefy. I never see Goulash Soup in the USA but in Europe in the wintertime it is everywhere you look. Sometimes it's made spicy but certainly  make it mild if he prefers it that way. Would he like the flavor of a bay leaf?\n    \n    One more, Chickeny Noodles. Make a big pot of chicken stock using a package of thighs, onion, and celery, Strain through a colander to remove solids. Put stock back in pot, bring it to a boil, and cook enough egg noodles in it that they take up all the stock (I use two whole bags of Manishevitz fine noodles).  While this is cooking take the meat off the chicken thighs. Let noodles cool for a while in stock to take it up and add the chicken meat. You will have a God Almightly lot of noodles and the chickeny stuff clings to every noodle. Can freeze in portions. Good just with grated Parmesan cheese or any sauce from a bottle or use Chickeny Noodles as base for anything you have.",

When the hams are on sale you can get them for like $1 - &amp;1.25 per pound.\n\nCarve off all the meat for sandwiches. It freezes well too. \n\nTake all the fat you had to trim off and render out all the fat on low heat. It's fantastic to cook with. The crispy cracklings you end up with make awesome dog treats.\n\nSoak the black eyed peas overnight after rinsing well and discarding any floaters.Take the bone and make stock with it. Slow cook those beans in it with some pieces of the meat, carrots, onion, celery and whatever herbs you like. Serve thy shit over rice when it's nice and thick.\n\nMy family of 4 has 3 meals worth of beans, some extra stock and lard for cooking, and weeks of ham sandwiches.",

It can be made quickly on a hob I then add stuff I like, like frozen vegetables, pulses, legumes and whatever meat It's really easy on the gums.  The other is Gram Flour.

I served it with white rice made in my instant pot, delicious! We are not spicy food people either.  I\u2019ve also done salsa chicken: 1.5-2lbs of chicken with a half of a 24 oz jar of mild salsa, you can switch out the chicken with a chuck roast, i cut it into 2\u201d slices so it cooks faster. 4-5 hours on low.",

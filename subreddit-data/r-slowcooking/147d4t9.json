    "postText": "Hi all,\nI\u2019m currently 3 hours into an 8 hour cook of beef bourguignon. It\u2019s looking a little watery though, so I\u2019m wondering what I should do if it doesn\u2019t thicken up in the next few hours.\n\nOptions- flour slurry, cornstarch slurry or maybe gravy mix? (Please recommend others you may use!) And at what stage should I add it in if I need to?\n\nThank in advance!\n\n(Main ingredients: onion, chuck steak, carrot, potato, tomato paste, stock, wine)\n\nUpdate: thank you all for the suggestions! It turned out delicious, it was definitely staying watery towards the end stages though. In the last hour I ended up scooping some liquid out, mixed cornstarch in and added back in. The consistency was perfect, especially as the meat fell apart and made it thicker. Will definitely try some of these other suggestions in the future :)",

Although, I prefer to use either their garlic mash or buttery mash flavors since they taste less \u201cchemically\u201d than the plain potato flakes. Both those flavors tend to fit well into most recipes that need thickening, so you can\u2019t notice you have flavored mashed potatoes in there besides having a thicker stew/sauce and potentially more garlic or butter flavor (and let\u2019s be honest, who would ever want less of either of those flavors? Haha)",

If you let potatoes (which are already in the recipe) cook down a bit, won't you get the same effect?",

That helps seal the juices in the meat and will somewhat thicken your sauce. \n\nHowever. \n\nFor a slow cooked version, and to avoid using flour that tends to trap flavor, you can filter out your broth and use a blender to add some xantham gum. Careful with the dosage as it thickens pretty fast. \n\nBut that is the best way to reach your desired sauce thickness without losing taste to the flour.",

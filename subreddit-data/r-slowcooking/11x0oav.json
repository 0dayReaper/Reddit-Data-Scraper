Cheddar cheese, bechamel style, Velveeta, even Kraft dinner, they're all great. This looks tasty, hope it was good!",

But don't use ALL Velveeta, only half, if that.\n\nThen, don't use pre-shredded cheese, for the love of god whatever you do, don't use pre-shredded. The anti-globbing agents give it a grainy texture and it doesn't melt right. Buy a block of whatever and shred it yourself.\n\nAnd by whatever, I mean havarti. Or Gouda. Something else that melts really easy.\n\nThen - add really sharp cheddar. Again, shred it yourself. The cheddar takes over most of the taste, but the Velveeta and other melty cheeses give it the consistency you want for bomb ass Mac n cheese.\n\nAdd milk or cream if you want it less thick.\n\nYou have to stir it occasionally so I wouldn't leave unattended for hours and hours.\n\nEdit: also as far as the pasta goes I would not recommend setting and forgetting for like 8 hours. This is one you have to baby to get the noodles right. Unless you like mush.",

As soon as you start boiling water, on your other burner you are starting your bechamel by mixing equal parts butter and flour, then adding a double amount of cups/ flour+butter. Once it starts to thicken, cut the heat and add way morew cheese than you think is necessary. Like an obscene amount. Then mix in the pasta. You can either call it quits at this point, or put bread crumbs and butter over the top and broil for a few minutes.\n\nSlow cooking a big sloppy mess isn't any better than just focusing on a dish for 30 minutes to make something insanely good.",

This is not, however, traditional southern mac as it lacks a cheesey crust. I'll always stand by mornay sauce layered and baked Mac personally but I am glad you enjoyed your dish!",

                    "comment": "Tbh, I prefer mac n cheese like this over stove top. I've made this recipe for years for just about every holiday &amp; there's never anything left. It's nice to make this on special occasions when I'm needing the oven &amp; more time to make additional things. I'm not going to say it's the best macaroni &amp; cheese I've ever had in my whole life, but it's the best one I've ever made by far. \ud83d\udc4d",

It's a very southern style recipe, not sure if you've ever had southern style mac, it's like a soul food version versus the like creamier stove top version a lot of people are used to, if that makes ANY sense lol.",

We had to add like a dozen more outlets just for Crock-Pot Thursday. Apparently it was an absolutely urgent requirement as team member satisfaction was crucial to keeping turnover down, and Crockpot Thursday was one of the ways that they tried to boost it.\n\nMakes for a great story when I'm interviewing and I get something like, \"Tell us about a time when you encountered an unexpected issue and how you resolved it.\" Interviewers love hearing about Crock-Pot Thursday! Hell in a second interview one person who had already heard the story told me to tell everybody else who was there interviewing me for the second interview.",

The company got stricter and stricter.  The employees became even more disgruntled than before. They felt like they were in a prison with bathroom breaks being monitored, can\u2019t celebrate any special occasion, no food or snacks in the office at all. Management claim to have all this experience and business degrees and yet they can\u2019t understand human nature. A little food that the company doesn\u2019t even pay for keeps the office happy. When will they ever realize that. ",

We were not to even think about delivering them a floor without those extra banks of outlets for the crock pots. And woe unto the person who said nobody had told us it was a requirement.

Don't be an asshole about it (No different than office cookies. Take two, not ten).\n\nMy guys worked so well, and then one day I forgot to buy the Gatorade. I figured we could go one day without it, we had stuff to do. How wrong I was. All of them slowed down to a snails pace, and I unhitched the trailer, and went and got a new can. Suddenly, everyone was working like gangbusters again.\n\nEdit: Per month to per week",

We didn't do it 300 wide though, it was based on departments or teams.  So, my team of 14 might go with the team next to us, or just do our own.  You didn't, then, go wandering into someone else's crock-pot set-up.  So, it would usually be a set-up for every 25-30 people or so.  Much more manageable than one big one for 300 people altogether.  \n\nAs a single, twenty-something guy, working at not an excellent paying job, I LOVED crock-pot days.  I would always bring something, but it was never going to knock your socks off.  BUT, the older ladies in the group or even the married mom's---they wanted to go all out and could better afford to do so.  That's when I'd get all those luxury snacks, dips, meatballs, pastries, etc. that I wouldn't or couldn't do for myself, living on my own.  I actually miss those days, lol.  I *do not*, however, miss those cubicles!",

A typical receptacle as part of this this systems furniture arrangement is 5-15r receptacle. These receptacles are pre wired, and the entire piece of furniture connects to a power wiring harness. This furniture can accommodate up to four 15a 120v circuits. Per code you're allowed to load a circuit up to 80% of the breaker capacity. In this case these all appear to be 15a, so you get around 1440 of power per circuit. Assuming that half of these cockpots are one ome circuit and the other on another, you're just under that threshold.\n\nAnywho looks good. ",

I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re 48\u201d panels... maybe Maxon (owned by Hon now)?\n\nThere are 8 simplex outlets per panel (4 on each side). 8 x 3 panels = 24 simplex... but let\u2019s double that assuming the same layout is mirrored outside the extense of the pic. That\u2019s 48 simplex outlets in this run. 1 run = 1 hardwire connection to building power.\n\nYou can use 26 outlets per CIRCUIT without overwhelming the system. 26 x 4 circuits = 104 outlets! You\u2019ve only got 48. You\u2019re good.\n\nThere aren\u2019t circuit breakers in the panel system and you\u2019d need a *huge* surge to trip the building power.\nThe worst thing you\u2019d experience with this set up is voltage loss, which might screw up a cheap crock pot.\n",

When shopping and reading the ingredients it called for condensed milk. I thought to myself that's weird. And scrolled through the comments multiple people mentioned using condensed milk and it was awesome. So i said fuck it we'll try it. WORST DECISION EVER. Couldn't take more than 2 bites it was like dessert Mac and cheese. It was a disaster. \n\nTL;DR Thought I made Mac and Cheese instead made Mac and Cheesecake. ",

It kinda becomes pointless when something you'd make in the oven in 30 minutes (which is equally as \"set it and forget it\") now takes 2 hours in the slow cooker. \n\nTo me, slow cooking makes sense when you can put it going while you're at work all day or asleep all night. I'm willing to sacrifice quality for that. A 2-hour recipe that also doesn't yield as good of results as the 30-minute traditional recipe? Not so much. ",

But regardless, I'm willing to sacrifice quality to have a meal ready when I arrive home from a long day at work. \n\nExcept.. The lasagna cook time was 2 hours. My traditional lasagna takes 45 minutes in the oven. I just didn't get it. You're giving up those wonderful crispy edges and non-mushy pasta for a recipe that you can essentially only use if you're home or back within 2 hours. For that, I may as well do the 45 minute one.

They make these recipes that are 4000, 5000 calories and give absolutely no indication as to how many people it's supposed to serve.

Your slow cooker lasagna is wayyyyy worse in quality yet it takes TWO HOURS vs. the 45 minutes that oven lasagna takes. \n\nSlow cookers make sense when you can turn them on and go to bed or go to work.

This might just be personal taste, or might come down to the specific gruyere you get, but I did not like the flavor of it enough for it to play such a dominant role. \n\n- The mozzerella. The tendency for the mozz to not melt completely and stay stringy really increased the sauce's perceived volume, and made it feel like I was eating cheese, instead of a cheese sauce, making the \"Too much cheese\" thing seem even worse. \n\nHowever, I was pleasantly surprised at how good both the noodles and bacon were coming out of the slow cooker. If I had to do it again I would do it the same, but change the ratio of the cheeses. Maybe just reduce the gruyere and mozz by half.",

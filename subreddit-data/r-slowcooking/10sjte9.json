Than once I put everything in the pot I threw on a little extra salt and pepper.",

            "comment": "Pro tip: If you saute your soft veggies and fresh herbs before adding them, you get a more robust flavor. This allows those flavor pallets to open up more and really add an inexplicable pop to your dish. This is especially true with potent fresh herbs and spices like basil, cilantro, garlic, ginger, rosemary, oregano, onions, celery, diced carrots, thyme etc. As these break down through the cooking process, it unlocks more of the flavor. If you're looking for even more punch with something like garlic, ginger, onions, nuts, and the like, then give them a mild touch of char as well. While slow cooking, do this towards the end, but allow enough time for these flavors to marry with the rest.",

Use a packet of brown gravy, packet of ranch dressing and a packet of Italian dressing then mix together and sprinkle it over the roast and veggies before cooking. It is a game changer. I swear u will get lots of compliments. Also put a half cup of water in with the roast, don't mix the water with the powder. The condensation and liquid from the roast and veggies will do all the work, plus it will create a nice gravy.",

Then do a quick lil sear on your onions &amp; carrots. \n\nNow throw it all in the crock pot. \n\nThen use some beef stock and red wine in the pot of meats and veg bits and bring it to a simmer while you use a whisk to scrape all the bits off the pan. \n\nNow pour that on top o\u2019 da meats and veggies in the crock pot. \n\nThrow a a couple cloves of garlic and a sprig Rosemary in that thang, put the lid on, and let it slow cook. Base time on size &amp; cut o\u2019 meats. I prefer a Chuck roast but that\u2019s just me\u2026\n\nOh, you\u2019re wondering where the potatoes and mushrooms are? Well I don\u2019t throw them in at the beginning bc they\u2019ll cook down and be mush and grainy by the end. So I prefer to either toss them in 3/4 of the way to finished OR! I skip the taters and serve over smashed mashed potatoes instead. Although these days I like to serve over some freaking yellow grits cooked in chicken stock and heavy cream and fresh grated parm mixed in. \n\nPot roast is my fave meal. I did it in the pressure cooker once and it was good. But I think I got my recipe down to a science now.",

To season the meat I use, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, smoked paprika, rosemary, thyme, and celery salt. I always let it marinate overnight. Next day, I sear it in olive oil. I put it in the crock pot and add beef broth, chopped onions, Worcestershire sauce, baby carrots, small white potatoes, 2 beef cubes, minced garlic, and a dash of corn starch to make the juice a bit thicker for gravy.

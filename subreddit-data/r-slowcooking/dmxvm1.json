So of course, it was soon followed by another, then another, until it became known as \"upvote soup\". Suddenly, there were dozens of \"upvote soup\" posts with those words in the title.\n\nMe and the other mods got together and decided those titles broke Reddiquette (\"no asking for upvotes\") and banned the term.

You can also use unsalted butter (and use half the amount of it). \n\nFinal tip: check the sodium content in your au jus packet/mix. Choose a lower sodium one. \n\nHowever, it *is* a fairly salty recipe. If you typically don\u2019t add salt or only very lightly salt your food it will taste salty to you. For me, I struggle not to over salt when cooking for others. Needless to say, I use salted butter in my Mississippi pot roast.\n\nEdit: also add plenty of veggies-potatoes, carrots, onions, green beans, etc.",

This squeezes all of the moisture out of the meat. There's no way to relax the muscle fibers and cooking in a liquid will create the same results. This is why it's generally a bad idea to boil lean meats like chicken breast and pork loin.",

And I drain the tomatoes, or use fresh diced romas. Deglaze with white wine before adding the liquids, lift all the fond. And WAY more parm than they suggest.",

Its one of the reasons you see ground beef in heat sealed containers now instead of wrapped with cling film, they pump some sort of gas in with it while its being heat sealed, and its supposed to help the meat last longer",

I'd probably freeze it. Definitely freeze it if it's in regular packaging. I know you said you're already going to cook it, so this is purely informational on my comfort zone, lol. I've wondered about this too in the past. Like, how are they getting those dates so far out on fresh meats? I've read that it has to do with consistency of the store's refrigeration vs home, but I wonder about it none the less!",

My grandmother still remembers the side room where they hung the carcass when she was a kid. So I\u2019m guessing that pork is probably treated in some way, vacuum sealed? maybe salt or something? and will most likely be totally fine.",

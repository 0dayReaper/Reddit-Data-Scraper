Peel and slice ginger into about 5 thick slices, peel garlic cloves, top and tail spring onions, slice onions and roughly chop chillis.\n2. Heat up a slug of oil in a pot on the hob (my slow cooker has a removable pot so I use this) and add the chopped aromatics, along with the hoisin sauce and star anise. Cook until onions are translucent, and then add the beef and give it a stir.\n3. Add in tomatoes quartered, soy sauces, rice wine, bay leaves and white pepper, and cook rapidly for about 5 mins.\n4. Add enough water in to cover the meat, bring to boil, and then transfer to slow cooker. Cook on high for 4 hours.\n5. To serve, stir in rice vinegar, pop the chunks of meat into bowls on top of cooked noodles and stir fried veggies, and then ladle the soup on top. Top with extra sliced spring onions. Don't eat without a bib. ;)",

Also, if there are no allergies, I add about a teaspoon of creamy (as unsweetened as you can find) peanut butter to the broth right before serving, it really makes the broth sooooo rich and complex. Also, stirfried pickled mustard greens for garnish!!! ",

I added a spoon of peanut butter like another poster recommended.  I through in 2 heads of bok choy at the last minute to give it that authentic flavor.  All in all it was the best Chinese dish I have ever made, thanks a lot!",

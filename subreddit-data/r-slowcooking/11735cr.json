Just followed what my mom's done for years.\n\nRoughly it's just a cheap beef roast, onion, garlic, carrots, celery, and potatoes. well seasoned with salt and pepper. I added a bit of water to keep it from burning (as well a to make a gravy later), and a vegetable stock cube. High for a couple of hours, then low for the rest of the time. Taking advice from this sub, I'm gonna make sure it cooks for at least 7-8 hours.",

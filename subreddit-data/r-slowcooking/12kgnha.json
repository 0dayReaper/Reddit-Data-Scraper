            "comment": "My own recipe just put together of things that needed using up. Ended up being a very pleasant meal, that made me ponder the whole time what it reminded me of - turns out a McDonalds filet-o-fish!\n\nAbout 700ml trim milk straight into the Slow Cooker, followed by a can of washed red kidney beans. At this point I've delved into a packet of spicy thai noodles just for the flavour sachet - stirred that through with a tsp of celery seed and several of sweet basil. Poured in \u2153 cup of Linseed. Left on high for about 90 minutes. Then turned to 'warm' setting.\n\nHalf a steamed broccoli later - finely chopped along with a handful of fresh coriander with the same treatment. Brushed these into the Slow Cooker, cracked open a small can of Tuna giving it all a final stir through and prepared a bowl / bed of 2 minute noodles. \n\nI loved the subtle spicy thai flavour thanks to all the milk and having celery seeds with basil really complimented the taste making it one of the better meals I've made. Both the greens really giving an instant hit of health. Have a good night!",

                                    "comment": "Oh man, vinegar is like a wonder chemical. It's great for cleaning all sorts of things. Basically because it's slightly acidic it will help dissolve mineral build up like in your slow cooker but can also help with some oil or other gunk so it's great for cleaning windows. If you search around online there's a ton of uses for it from helping to deodorize and clean dishwashers and washing machines, to cleaning windows, cleaning up mineral build up in slow cookers or faucets, getting tea/coffee stains out of mugs, all sorts of good stuff.\n\nFor the amount of buildup in your slow cooker you'd need to let the vinegar sit for quite a while, preferably with the lid on, for it to clean all that out. It won't harm the enamel on the ceramic so no worries there. Definitely easier to start with Bartenders Friend to do all the tough cleaning though as vinegar will take quite a while to get through all that. Then the vinegar becomes a thing you wash with instead of (or after using) dishsoap to keep the mineral buildup down.\n\nEdit: kinda forgot to answer your actual question. For dealing with heavy buildup like this, you'd pour vinegar in until you've got maybe half an inch and then put the lid on and let it soak. It'll literally dissolve the mineral buildup. For as much as appears to be in there, it might take a day or so. The lid is to help keep the vapors inside which will help dissolve some of the stuff on the sides as well and stop your kitchen from smelling like vinegar while it soaks. Though even then the occasional wipe down with a vinegar soaked paper towel will work better on the sides. Really you're just letting the vinegar dissolve the mineral buildup. Your buidup looks kinda thick though so I'd still recommend Barkeeper's Friend to get this all cleaned out and looking new again and save the vinegar for regular cleaning.",

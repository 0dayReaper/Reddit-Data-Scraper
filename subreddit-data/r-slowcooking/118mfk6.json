    "postText": " A couple of weeks ago, I saw a comment ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/10ti3zt/comment/j776k63/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) posted from u/Icy-Establishment298 for making a concentrated soup base and was excited to try it out.\u00a0 I just finished it yesterday and have to rave about it a bit.\u00a0 I didn't include pictures because it just ends up looking like thick baby food, but I added some to the shepherds pie I made and it was delicious.\u00a0 I will definitely be playing around with this in the future.\n\nThere are several vegetable/herb combo options listed in u/Icy-Establishment298's comment, but I was going for a very basic flavor profile, so I used 1 large onion and 2 carrots, several chopped tomatoes and about 3 stalks celery.\u00a0 I was aiming for roughly equal parts, but when it was all chopped, I worried that there was too much carrot and added a little more onion and 2 tablespoons of tomato paste to the \u00bd cup water.\u00a0 Then I used about 1 teaspoon of salt, some pepper and parsley.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt cooked on low for about 9 hours, then I blended it with a healthy amount of nutritional yeast.\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n\nAbout halfway through cooking, I let the moisture escape so the mixture would cook down.\u00a0 I think I would try to cook it even longer next time, but I didn't start it early enough.\u00a0 I am curious if anyone else has made anything similar?",

            "comment": "Oh my gosh! That's so exciting! I'm glad it worked out so well.\n\nAs a single household that leans flexitarian on a simple living/food budget, that Kathy Hester Vegan Slow Cooking for Two or just You  book has been such a gold mine of  surprises for me. The concentrated soup base was one of them.\n\n As mentioned, I don't always follow her vegan meat substitute ideas, a lot of times if she suggests tofu I might if I feel up to it use chicken and adjust accordingly. Her chapter on 3 squares where you layer items in, sometimes separated by aluminum foil, ( 3 course thanksgiving dinner) is another fun chapter in the book.\n\nThe first food chapter on prepping things like the soup base also has a recipe on caramelizing onions in slow cooker. You then use or freeze what you want and can skip the whole sautee onion on stove first thing.\n\nSo happy this worked out for you.",

I put it all in my crockpot with water and cook about 12 hrs total, then I use a regular blender to pur\u00e9e it all prior to freezing for later use. I fill various sizes of containers or make a tray of ice cubes, bc sometimes I need a lot, sometimes a little.",

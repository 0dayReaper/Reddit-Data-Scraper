            "comment": "I'm not sure who I need to give credit to, but someone linked the 15 bean crockpot chili recipe (From the \"Spend with Pennies\" site) who partnered with Hurst's \"Hambeen\" company.  I linked it below.  Thanks to the redditor who posted this - I forgot your name.  Overall it's a solid recipe but I don't think it's in the ideal form for me.  My comments for you to review and the link and recipe is below as is.\n\n**My thoughts**\n\n* It says 8 cups of beef broth, but wow does this end up being too soupy for my preference.  Next time maybe 7 cups or even 6 cups?\n* I omitted the flavor packet that came with the beans.  IMHO, if I would have used it then this recipe would have been REALLY SALTY\n* I used hot kettle water and beef base to make the 8 cups of water as opposed to using a premade beef broth.  I think this carried enough salt plus what would be used in the chili seasonings is plenty of salt.\n* I doubled the can of diced tomatoes to 28 oz.  I thoroughly drained them but the recipe did not specify.  Also, I did not have diced tomatoes with green chilis, so I used regular diced tomatoes and put 3 jalapeno peppers sliced and including seeds.  \n* If I'm going to stick with 8 cups of broth, then this recipe would work better in a dutch oven so that some of that water can reduce.  Since we were to cook on high and the tips say to not take the lid off, there was nowhere for that water to go.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://hurstbeans.com/recipes/15-bean-slow-cooker-chili](https://hurstbeans.com/recipes/15-bean-slow-cooker-chili)\n\nLink above but recipe below:\n\n**Ingredients**\r  \n1 package HamBeens 15 BEAN SOUP\u00ae w/ Ham Flavor packet\r  \n\r  \n1lb. lean ground beef\r  \n\r  \n1 onion, diced\r  \n\r  \n1 green bell pepper, diced\r  \n\r  \n1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomato with green chiles\r  \n\r  \n1 can (6 oz) tomato paste\r  \n\r  \n8 cups beef broth\r  \n\r  \n1 packet of your favorite chili seasoning mix (approx. 1.5 oz)\r  \n\r  \nsalt &amp; pepper to taste\r  \n\r  \n**Cooking Directions**\r  \nRinse beans and remove any debris.\r  \n\r  \nBrown beef over medium heat until no pink remains.

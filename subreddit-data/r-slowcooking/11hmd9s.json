For extra bonus points brown those bits (in bottom of stock pot or briefly roasted in very hot oven)\n\n- toss a whole yellow onion (skin on) in your stock. Again, for extra bonus points, halve through the root and brown it a bit first too\n\n- three letters: MSG (a little goes a long way- less than a quarter teaspoon is usually plenty for a large stock pot). \n\n- this seems obvious, but don\u2019t underseason (salt or black pepper)\n\n- I like to add some fresh and dry herbs that play well with bird (any combo of parsley, thyme, celery seed, fennel seed, dill). If using fresh dill or parsley, only add at the very end of the cooking process. \n\n- other umami adds: sprinkle of mushroom powder, a dash of soy sauce\n\nSome things to avoid:\n- don\u2019t cook your starch (noodles, rice, etc- with exception of dumplings) in your stock. Boil in separate pot.\n\n- control your temp. Avoid a hard boil and try to keep it at a gentle simmer. Skim scum from surface for first hour/ish of cooking or until its gone.",

A very small amount of dulce dissolved into the stock adds real depth of flavour, and I always use something i call \u2018green\u2019. Usually just cabbage in any soup stock.\n\nYou don\u2019t need much but you need something to give it soup stock depth.  Spinach, kale, broccoli. Something.  You don\u2019t have to leave it in if you don\u2019t want but boil it as part of your initial stock for flavour.\n\nOh and if you roast your chicken first using the following method, then boil it for an hour to start your soup you will get maximum flavour from it.\n\nDry a whole chicken with some paper towels\nPut in a baking pan\nDry the inside of chicken as well, add a little salt and pepper to the cavity. Try to keep it dry\nPour kosher salt on top. Don\u2019t rub it in, just let it fall wherever it falls. Give it a good coating.\n\nThen bake it in a preheated oven at 450 for 1.5 hours.  You will think its going to burst into flames. It won\u2019t. The salt seals the skin so juice doesn\u2019t escape. When its done the salt just lifts right off and chicken tastes like swiss chalet.\n\nBest way to roast a chicken. From there you can go straight to making your stock. I pour in the pan drippings too. Soup stock is really about the fat.\n\nBoil it in water until it\u2019s completely falling apart, at least an hour. Then pull all the solid stuff out so you just have water full of chicken fat.  Let the chicken cool in a container so you can handle it and remove the meat when its cool. Theres no rush.\n\nStart adding your soup stock ingredients like onion, bay leaf, basil, whatever.\n\nAnd always always use an acid in soup. Chicken soup is best with lemon juice",

Or try vinegar of some sort, an aged balsamic could be good if you're into that,  hot sauce is basically salt, peppers, and vinegar, try some of that.  MSG is also perfectly safe to use and would be great here.  Fresh ground pepper is great too.",

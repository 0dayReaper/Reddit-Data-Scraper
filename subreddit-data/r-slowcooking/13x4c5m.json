I poured almost to veggies level. \n3) Is the order okay? I mean, veggies and then ribs.",

I couldn\u2019t tell if it was uncooked and the crock was stained, or if it was beefy buildup on the sides from cooking for 8 hours. The veggie combo sounds great but (a little tip) I find corn and peppers can get a little mush if cooked along with meat and potatoes for too long. I\u2019m curious how it ended up! I bet it would be a great combo over white rice.",

I stirred it a bit when I woke up and the beef kinda started falling into pieces so I guess it did get completely cooked - I\u2019ll snap a couple pics when I finally eat and upload it too!",

That doesn't braise well.\n\nUsually if I'm making short rib stew I'll do it one of two ways.\n\nThe first is to coat in salt and pepper then sear it, remove from the Dutch oven or pan, add celery onion carrot, sauteed for a few minutes to release the fond. From here you can go a few different directions. Add some tomato paste and garlic then butter and flour to make a roux.\n\n Then add some spices. Common is to add bay leaves and thyme. I generally also add garam masala and cumin to make the flavor richer. \n\nNext add your meat back in and then add beef stock to cover it and then some.\n\nYou can either pressure cook this for 40-50min or throw the pot covered in the oven for 3-4 hours until tender. \n\nIf you want to add potatoes or corn do that when there is about 1 hour remaining.",

I make a marinade with bbq sauce and a few other things, place the ribs in the pot, add the marinade (3/4 of it) and cook them on high for 8 or low for 10-12. After that they are so tender you need to be careful not to let them fall apart. \nAfter that they go onto the grill or oven to crisp them up a bit (add marinade) and they are ready to go. I never heard about a veggie marinade or something like that, curious how they taste. \nAlso i don't add much if any water at all, since they lose a fair amount of water in the process.",

Then pull them out in the morning, put on low when I go to work. Come home, pull them out, put some BBQ sauce on and broil for a few minutes. They end up being fall off the bone tender.\n\nThe rub I usually use is salt, fresh cracked black pepper, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, and sometimes a touch of cayenne.",

He did a really great job too. It was a decision my folks made when I was little, and since my mum was the breadwinner by a long shot, it made sense. I didn't understand it at the time and we got made fun of pretty hard for it, but I digress.\n\nA single income was a hard thing to make fiasable with 2 kids that broke a lot of stuff. So here's the point I'm trying to make. My Mother did the budget and told my Dad that whatever was leftover from the food budget every month became his booze budget. And my Dad liked to drink. \n\nThe meat we got was always of the absolutely lowest grade for whatever we were making. We had super tough, overcooked roasts filled to the brim with grisel. So naturally when I heard we were having a pot roast I would lose my shit and basically destroy the thing. \n\nJust to be clear, we ate healthy meals.  And we were healthy kids. But I didn't have a good beef dip or steak til I was in my twenties. First World problems eh.",

The quality of the meat shouldn't really matter, the whole point of low and slow is to turn tough, undesirable cuts delicious. Maybe your slow cooker is faulty and cooking at too high a temperature? I would do a little experiment with a meat thermometer and see how hot it gets after a few hours on low. Also make sure you're keeping the fat on the meat. It comes down to either you aren't cooking long enough, the temperature is too high, or your meat is too lean.",

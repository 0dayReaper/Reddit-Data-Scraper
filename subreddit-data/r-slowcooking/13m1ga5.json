    "postText": "The older New Englanders always said you have to cook the beans in the oven for at least 8 hours, adding hot water when the level in the pot gets low. They came out just as good, I think, in the crockpot with much less attention.\n\nRecipe (adapted for the crock pot from an old Maine cookbook):\n\n1 lb. dry beans\n\n2 Tbs. sugar\n\n1 tsp. salt\n\n1 -2 tsp. dry mustard\n\n2 Tbs. molasses\n\n1/2 lb. salt pork\n\nWash  the beans and soak overnight. Next morning drain them, add all the  seasonings and mix them into the beans. Put them in the pot, cover with  fresh water (use hot water to get them going faster). Score the pork,  and put it on top of the beans. Cook 8 hours, starting on high and  switching to low when they start bubbling.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mj2ochdgkt0b1.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=de60d602b69b48768acea1fadc478ad3b012a44b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ou4z4idgkt0b1.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5520a78aa5fcc5ca32453c92518c51dd2380734a",

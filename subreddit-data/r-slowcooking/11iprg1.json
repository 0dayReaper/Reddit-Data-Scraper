            "comment": "I've always had hand me downs, thrift store, and once I bought one new because the black Friday price I just couldn't pass up.\n\nSo, price doesn't equate to a better tasting meal.\n\nWhat does matter to me is the crock, or ceramic insert itself. Is it uniformly thick, and glazed, without imperfections.\n\nThe next thing can be tricky, in how uniformly does it heat, and does it have any hot spots? Also, how does it cycle heat - does the element have a true high or low, or even warm, or is it just cycling faster/slower? It's difficult to find anything anymore with true heat control.\n\nThen there are features you want which kind of come down to preference, like a warm function, or timers, Bluetooth, lid design (the clamps ARE NOT for cooking, but do cone in handy for storage and more so for transport if you go to events.) Color, cord length, trusted brand badge, size, dishwasher safe lid or crock, etc.\n\nI like my large one and use it most, but I don't mind leftovers and more of the same. My \"regular\" round one works great for soups, and canning like apple butter. The mini one I love for dips and came as part of the black Friday purchase of the big one. So glad because it replaced the big one from my grandfather that died and roommate broke the lid on. Then my mini from my grandmother burned out (element just fried) and again, black Friday purchase to the rescue. Love the mini one for chip dips  and small batch drinks like milled wine, cider, or potpourri.\n\nSo, I know it's a fascinating world out there, and the sky's the limit, but look at the recipes you really want to try, what you know you like to eat, and which seems to fit in best on form and function. Happy shopping!",

Some of what I do I am now told not to do or that it is impossible. When I was teaching school  and left home at 7 AM I would put a frozen boneless turkey breast in the SC and come home at 4 PM and have it nicely ready to use the cooked meat for whatever.  Am  now told that's a no-no. But we all still thriving. Ignorance is bliss.",

I\u2019m really happy with it.\n\nMy favorite feature is that it\u2019s programmable, with warm/low/high settings and can be set to cook for up to 10 hours. When it finishes its cooking time, it will automatically switch to the warm setting. This is important to me because I often have to work overtime, and this keeps the food safe until I get home.",

On the other hand, if you get a large one but are only feeding 2, then you will not use it as much because it will feel like too much trouble. Also, although most will have a ceramic insert, mine has aluminum which allows me to brown meats on the stove top and then place in the slow cooker, all in the same pan. I love this feature.",

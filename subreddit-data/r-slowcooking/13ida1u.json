I add about half a pack of Italian salad dressing mix and a bunch of fresh ground black pepper. I do it this way because I don't want it too salty, I'm very sensitive to sodium.\n\nI like to have it on French bread with sharp white cheddar &amp; provolone, but it's good with mashed potatoes too. It's better if you brown the roast and the onions well first, it adds a lot of flavor, but I don't usually bother.\n\nAlso, carrots definitely add sweetness, especially if you brown them with the onions.",

Now, when I make it, I don't usually use butter at all....most chuck roasts are fatty. I just use the pepperoncini juice or a splash of beef broth (like 1/4 cup?). When it's a lean roast, I might do 1/4 stick.",

I alsways felt an entire stick of butter was crazy so I try and pick a roast with good marble, and I brown it in olive oil, salt, and plenty of fresh ground pepper.  Really brown it and get that Maillard reaction going and add to the pot. Then I sweat a half of an onion diced up in the skillet I used to brown and deglaze with a splash of red or cooking wine and scrape all that fond from the pan add it all on top of the roast with other ingredients except I use only 3 or 4 tablespoons butter. I end up with a much better roast and the liquid isn\u2019t near as greasy.",

Some of it is just lazy hacks or unbalanced tastes, like 1:10 butter on a roast. Why not make some fuckin\u2019 [sketti](https://youtu.be/OT1X2FBf7hw?t=212) while you\u2019re at it. \n\nYou don\u2019t need a food scientist, you need a BASIC understanding of cooking and nutrition. Maybe read a cookbook that teaches you *how* to cook, not lists of recipes. Slowcooking is a great supplement to a kitchen, but it also attracts the frugal, the lazy, and the unskilled. Thus, you get recipes that need a therapist, a life coach, or a priest more than any sort of food expert. If you are asking this question: great, you are recognising some of these recipes are meant for rehabilitating habitual PB&amp;J eaters. \n\nOP, the butter is to add volume and\u2026 butteriness to the jus. It is not needed, especially on a fatty piece of meat. Searing a bit before the slowcooker will be fine without butter.",

That richer, fatty (I wish there was a better word) feel that coats the mouth. Lower fat gives the feel of a lighter dish. Again, provided the right cut is used this is often not needed as the necessary fats render out of the meat. \n\nFor flavour enhancement, certain molecules are carried differently by fats than by water. Having them bound by fat makes them more readily available to the tastebuds meaning that a dish with fat vs without will have a very different flavour profile even if the fat in question has a neutral taste. Once again, this shouldn\u2019t be a problem due to fat from the meat. \n\nFinally. Dairy does have a distinct flavour profile of its own, especially dairy fats. I am going to assume, based on the above, that the butter is pretty much only included for its flavour, in which case, I would probably omit it.",

            "comment": "I am thrilled to share with you my recipe for Bigos Hultajski, a hearty and flavourful Polish stew prepared in a slow cooker. It is perfect for chilly nights and will warm both your body and soul with every delicious bite. The combination of sauerkraut, beef, potatoes and smoked sausage creates a symphony of flavours that will leave you craving for more. So, let's put on our aprons and start cooking!\n\nBigos Hultajski is a simplified version of the traditional stew with fewer ingredients and requires less preparation time. This peasant version is flavoured with beer, which gives it a unique taste, and also contains potatoes and carrots. It is opposite to Bigos Kr\u00f3lewski that requires more ingredients.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for Bigos Hultajski in Slow Cooker:**\n\n\\* 14 oz stewing beef (400g) cut into large dice (chuck, brisket, round steak, or short ribs)\n\n\\* 14 oz kielbasa (400g) Polish smoked sausage\n\n\\* 17.6 oz sauerkraut with liquid (500g)\n\n\\* 4 medium sized potatoes, halved, skin on\n\n\\* 1 large carrot, peeled and diced\n\n\\* 1 large onion diced\n\n\\* 4 cups of beef stock (1L) enough to cover everything in the slow cooker\n\n\\* 1 glass beer (240ml)\n\n\\* 2 bay leaves\n\n\\* 4 juniper berries\n\n\\* 1 tbsp marjoram\n\n\\* 1 tbsp caraway (helps with digestion)\n\n\\* 1 tbsp honey (add enough to balance sourness)\n\n\\* 1 tsp ground black pepper\n\n\\* 1 tbsp tomato puree\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to prepare Bigos Hultajski:**\n\n1. Heat a frying pan over high heat and sear the diced beef until browned. Transfer the beef to the slow cooker, leaving the fat in the pan.\n2. Add sliced sausage to the same pan and continue frying until browned, then transfer it to the slow cooker.\n3. In the same pan, sear the diced onions, carrots, and garlic until they are softened and lightly browned. Transfer them to the slow cooker as well.\n4. Add all the remaining ingredients to the slow cooker and stir well to combine. Cover with a lid and set the slow cooker to high heat for 6 hours. After the first hour, give it a good stir and repeat every hour or so to distribute the flavours.\n5. When the Bigos is ready, remove the bay leaves and serve hot with buttered sourdough bread. Bigos tastes even better with time, so you can store it in the fridge for up to three days, freeze it, or store it in jars if you make a bigger batch. Reheat it gently on the stovetop or in the microwave before serving. Enjoy!\n\nOriginally posted: [Bigos Hultajski in Slow Cooker](https://www.insightflavour.com/post/bigos-hultajski-in-slow-cooker)",

It is quite a bit quicker and costs less per serving then traditional beef. Another option is to try it with bison, caribou or even turkey.\n\nNone the less well done! Firsts are always memorable and become staples for you and your family/friends.",

In the UK and Australia, a recipe very similar to that commonly found in the United States has become popular, generally served with rice and sometimes with pasta as well as in commercially prepared frozen dishes.[12] Today, the dish is generally served over wide or twisted egg noodles in the United States.*\n\nI'm assuming you're not from the US if this isn't familiar to you?",

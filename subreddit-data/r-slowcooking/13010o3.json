While I have some breasts, I am also using chicken tenderloins. They\u2019re a lot smaller so I assume they\u2019ll cook faster, any advice on when to add them? I was thinking maybe 2 hours after ?",

I\u2019ve never really understood that because I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable leaving my house at all with a slow cooker running, but some people have that mindset and I think a lot of these recipes are for them. Same with not minding (or even preferring) super dry meat. Some people straight up never eat sauce. Idk I guess my point is that while I agree the recipes are objectively shitty, there are people who genuinely love that stuff lol",

And I'm just like 'wouldn't that be totally the wrong cut of meat for that'?\n\nLike, what are they thinking? Something along the lines of 'if I cook soft meat with the 'make softer' technique, then it'll get even softerer'?",

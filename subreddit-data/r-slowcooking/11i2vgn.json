The most time-consuming thing was the braised pork belly. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/zm2JumL\n\nOne thing I learned is when you're making dumpling filling, add a couple tablespoons of water to the mixture and then only stir in one direction, clockwise or counterclockwise. It's something about keeping the meat smooth so it holds together and has a nice texture. Also, boil a spoon of it to test for seasoning before you form the whole batch. \n\nOh, and if you have dumpling filling or Char sui pork or chives and eggs - whatever you've got,  and are feeling lazy, you can cheat and use canned biscuits for steamed bao. My MIL used to do that at home all the time. You can buy the little steamer liners, but if you've got cabbage leaves, those will work just fine. Hmm... If you get an opportunity to try Zhongzi, don't pass it up. Sticky rice with sweet or savory fillings, yes please.",

All full blood American Wagyu are from this herd. Sometime after shipping the herd to Australia, Japan made Kobe Beef a national treasure &amp; no more animals can be shipped.\n\nToday, in the US there's a network of Wagyu beef genetics &amp; bull semen avaliable for breeding purposes and American full blood Wagyu is in fact Kobe beef.\n\nI'm not certain of labling requirements but some farmers have cross bred them with Angus or others. \n\nSource: My cousin raises Full blood American Wagyu beef. He's crossed them with angus &amp; holstein before. He's also stripped embro's from the waygu cow &amp; had them implanted in a holstein. Said the holstein is a better mother. Expensive to do &amp; not every embryo will take.",

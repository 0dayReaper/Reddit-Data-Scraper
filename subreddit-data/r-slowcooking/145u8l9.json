Hugh Acheson from the book The Chef and the slow cooker agrees. I've poached white fish in olive oil and chicken breast to great success. Give ma a moment.",

            "comment": "Okay so to do this you have to be willing to get rid of the idea your slow cooker is only good  your cook something for twelve hours such as a pot roast as well as understanding how fish being more delicate will cook faster. In addition to being great at braising ( pot roast I'm looking at you) with a couple of techniques it makes an excellent water bath - (pot in pot method for oatmeal, and cheesecake) as well as a terrific vehicle for the gentle art of poaching chicken and duck breasts, pork chops ( mmm milk poached  pork chops) and of course fish.\n\nI have poached nice cod loins in the slow cooker in just garlic, rosemary and a mix of olive oil and broth. It turns out well and takes about and hour on high. And before people say just do it on the stove/oven  1)  don't wanna 2) it allows me to walk away and do other things things and 3) you run your kitchen, I'll run mine thanks \n\nOk, so what you are going to want to do is create a flavor broth. I recommend a court broth a lemon and herb broth created to poach chicken or fish. You'll put the broth ingredients in the slow cooker turn it on high and let it cook for 30 minutes. Then gently place your whole  salmon in it and let it cook for another hour. If it's whole you may need an hour and a half. Researching this shows slow cooker fish recipes poach up to two hours. I'd probably just start checking it at an hour if it's whole. My slow cooker,  \"Black Alyss\" runs hot like a good witch in menopause does, so I just work around her mood. \n\n\nNow you aren't completely free like you are with pot roast of truly set it and forget it because you are going to have to check it at the 45, and hour mark. But! You won't have to be chained to the stovetop like stovetop poaching  or heat up your oven on a hot summer day.or for that matter babysit a grill. \n\nSo go water the garden, play with the kids, scrub a toilet, read a chapter in the book watch an episode of Bojack Horseman and think \"wow, the cuts a little to close to the bone\" while sipping your third glass of wine! You got dinner covered.\n\nIt's done when it flakes and is opaque, flakes easily. You know when salmons done I'm assuming, you've been down that road before.\n\nOkay, enough blathering here's how to poach  salmon or any delicate fish:\n\nCourt Broth/Poached Salmon\n\n2 cups of water ( you can use a light vegetable broth but I want my salmon to taste like salmon not chicken or vegetables so I use water - I'll spare you my rant on \"strawberry flavored\" canned  peaches) \n\n1 cup white wine or you could use 1/2 cup white wine vinegar with another half cup water if you don't use alcohol\n\n1 lemon sliced thin\n\n1 shallot sliced thin or in a pinch I've used half of whatever onion I've got laying about\n\n5-6 sprigs of fresh thyme, rosemary,  dill fronds, or tarragon  or thyme or 2 tsps of  tsp dried herbs\n\n1 tsp fresh black peppercorns\n\n1 tsp salt\n\nSalmon either leave whole or turn into 4-6 filets ( recipe below is for filets) \n\nSalt and pepper\n\nCombine water, wine, lemon, shallots,  herbs, peppercorns and salt in the slow cooker and cook on high for 30 minutes.\n\nSeason the top of the salmon with salt and pepper and place in the slow cooker, skin side down. Cover and cook on low until salmon is opaque in color and flakes gently with a fork. Start checking for desired doneness after 45 minutes to an hour and continue cooking until preferred doneness is reached. (Salmon can be held on the warm setting as per my research  for several hours  but I've never risked it ) \n\nRemove and serve with drizzle of olive oil, lemon wedges and salt and pepper to taste.",

This is not a \"cook supper while at work all day\" recipe.\n\nIs there a reason you want to cook fish in your slow cooker?\n\nMy tip would echo the other commenter -- unless there is no oven available for cooking, a slow cooker is not the best method for fish.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve done it before when I couldn\u2019t use the oven, but please for the love of god don\u2019t cook it any longer than 2 hours, this isn\u2019t an all day option, it does have decent fat which helps but it\u2019s not like meat juices to stop it drying out. If you have access to an oven or grill that\u2019s the best bet for most fish. I think adding a small amount of liquid before you put the lid on (stock or water) would help, similar to a poached salmon dish that you\u2019d cook on a hob. Then lemon juice /wedges and a bit of dill if you have some. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d mess about adding any vegetables or potatoes because the salmon would need much less time than they would.",

I love all the things I omitted or reduced but am trying to keep my diet fairly low fodmap so changes were needed. \n\nI ate a small amount of it with some jasmine rice and broccoli, and it made a fabulous lunch.",

Normally the pork steak I get doesn\u2019t have quite this much fat, but this was from Aldi and was much fattier than usual. Obviously, that\u2019s why it tastes so good!\n\nI\u2019ll just check it after it\u2019s been in the refrigerator for a few hours and skim off some of that fat.",

But I try not to just toss that fat. I like to save it to add flavor to other dishes that may not already have much/if any fat.",

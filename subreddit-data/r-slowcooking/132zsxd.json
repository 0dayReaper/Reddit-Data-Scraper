I've done all three to pretty good results. \n\n\nI've made the vegan and then a non vegan version of Hester's Lemon blueberry cake, it was pretty good, and good enough to use again and modify to my tastes and what's on hand.\n\n Is it perfect like Great British Bakeoff Star Baker? No, of course not. But Star Baker muffins can only be found in a few places here, I don't drive so I'm not making an extra trip for one, and I might have mentioned I didn't want to babysit a hot oven or heat up my house with a 350 degrees oven today.\n\nI'm okay with good enough and not perfect, because A) not a YouTube food influencer, or Martha Stewart. Also, Gordon Ramsay isn't descending into my kitchen to scream at me at how I suck and am a failure at life and cooking. \n\nB) Perfect should never be the enemy of good in the realm of food.",

Stir in all wet ingredients except strawberries and poppy seeds until everything is combined and no dry spots remain. Gently fold in strawberries and seeds \n\nSpray your slow cooker with cooking spray or butter generously. Spoon in batter. To prevent condensation and soggy cake, fold a clean dish towel in half so it's not touching sides of slow cooker and place over top of insert. Place lid on top of towel. Cook on high for 60 to 80 minutes. Go outside and enjoy your walk on a unseasonably warm spring day, or working in garden or playing with your dog instead of babysitting a hot oven on a warm day.\n\nCake is done when middle is solid and doesn\u2019t indent when you touch it.\n\nServe it forth, with a good cup of Irish breakfast tea or coffee, and  enjoy your muffin cake knowing you satisfied your triple mission of inflaming the slow cooker trolls, not heating up your house by turning on oven while still satisfying  your Saturday muffin craving.",

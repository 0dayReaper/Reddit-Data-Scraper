Looking to make meals/soups or anything really that will freeze and feed a family of four. We just did our weekly food shop and even with only buying one meat, it was extortionate! \n\nPlease share any recipes here that you think are a staple or relatively frugal meal. I\u2019m aware ingredients may be differently priced across the world but please, let\u2019s compile a list :)",

You could definitely do less or no ground beef, do a soy substitute, or sub in lentils or sliced mushrooms depending on what works for you:\n\nHearty Beef and Cabbage Soup\r  \n\r  \n1 lb. ground beef\r  \n1 medium onion, chopped\r  \n40 oz. can tomatoes (I usually use two 14 or 15 oz cans. You can use the flavored, diced or plain diced, or just plain canned whole romas)\r  \n2 C. water\r  \n15 oz. kidney beans (you could use any favorite white or red bean)\r  \n1 t. salt\r  \n1/2 t. pepper\r  \n1 T. chili powder\r  \n1/2 C. chopped celery\r  \n2 C. thinly sliced cabbage\r  \n\r  \nSaute beef in skillet; drain.\r  \n\r  \nCombine all ingredients except cabbage in slow cooker.\r  \n\r  \nCover; cook on low 3 hours (again, I've done this longer on low and been OK). Add cabbage; cook on high 30-60 minutes.\r  \n\r  \nI'ved added corn, diced potatoes and red or green peppers to this depending on what I had laying around. If using peppers, I usually saute the onion, beef and pepper together first. Either way is fine.",

With a cup of rice, some veggies, and a very small amount of meat you can make enough food for a family of four. One single sausage link, one piece of chicken, a couple slices of bacon or some similar amount. I've even made it with scrap meat trimmings I was saving in the freezer for stock.\n\nBrown your meat in a bit of oil, add some veggies (carrot,onion,garlic,celery,anything you have in the fridge) and sautee for a little bit. Add some salt and spices (I like ginger,white pepper,black pepper,and a splash of soy sauce). Don't wash the rice. Just add it to the pot and add like 4x as much water as you normally would for rice. Then all you have to do is bring it to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. It needs to simmer for over an hour. You'll know it's done when the rice is totally broken down and everything starts to thicken into a porridge.",

I don't use that site too often, just because I don't cook nearly as much as I used to and often just throw something together that I know or make up :) But, I think it's pretty reliable in terms of how well recipes come out. I would doubt she updates the cost of the recipes, but I don't know for sure. Besides, you can definitely adjust for your area-if something is selling too high for you, you just pass on that one. I was very happy with this soup, and froze a lot of it.",

Turned out really tasty. \n\nRed dog Toast Bread pudding with optional kale\n\n(Please either line your slow cooker with parchment or coat liberally with butter or cooking spray other wise you'll be soaking that insert because the edges will stick)\n\nI made this in my 3 quart slow cooker Black Alyss so I used lesser amount of bread given below \n\n\nCubed stale sturdy bread like day old  baguette or ciabatta about 1-3 cups depending on slow cooker size \n\n2 eggs\n\n1/2 cup of canned tomato soup\n\n2 tsp dried thyme or basil ( dealer's choice ) \n\n2 tablespoons of melted fat such as leftover bacon or sausage  drippings, olive oil or melted butter\n\n1 tsp of black pepper \n\nSalt to taste ( like really taste it first, the undiluted soup is going to be salty) \n\nMinced garlic\n\noptional either a tsp of onion powder or diced onion about half a cup or both you can do both\n\nOptional - cooked bacon, cooked pork breakfast sausage, few leaves of  chopped kale or other greens, chopped\n\nOptional but why wouldn't you - 1/4 to half cup of shredded cheese like mozzarella, cheddar or Swiss/harvarti\n\nEither line your slow cooker with parchment or spray generously with cooking spray.\n\nIn a mixing bowl  whisk soup, bacon drippings, eggs together until lighter in color. Stir in herbs, pepper,  garlic and onion powder. Taste and maybe add in a pinch of salt but remember cheese is salty too. \n\nAdd bread cubes and any vegetables to bowl tossing gently to coat. Let stand for about fifteen minutes while you clean up. Add bread mixture to your prepped slow cooker insert. Turn on low and cook for five -6 hours. If you have a slow cooker that switches to keep warm that's awesome but the smaller ones don't so mine cooked on low while I slept for eight hours. It was fine.\n\nThe top and edges will be crispy like brownie edges but the middle will seem soupy so you do need to let this rest for 15- 20 minutes. I just turned the slow cooker off for 20 minutes.",

Personally an instant pot is useful to me now because I have a kid and I like being able to turn it on and walk away because it turns itself off and the liquid can't evaporate away. I don't use it cook whole elaborate meals of course, but we do lots of soups and stews, or things like a ragu for pasta, curry to eat with rice. I can even throw in the ingredients for the ragu at night then assemble a lasagne in the morning. I don't make so many meals involving different elements these days, it's not really our style to eat meat with various sides anyway, and I have plenty of burners to do the rest of the meal for special occasions. Not sure why you think it would save space to get a separate pressure cooker and slow cooker anyway. In short, an instant pot suits my lifestyle and cooking habits, although I don't use it daily or anything. For me and I'm sure many others short on time it's good to have the option to program and keep things warm without being chained to the stove. I don't live in a micro apartment or anything, just don't have a huge amount of storage space for things I wouldn't use much. I didn't ask for advice on getting rid of it as I'm happy with it.",

In a pinch it'll get the job done.\n\nThe Instant Pot, like all electric pressure cookers isn't a very good pressure cooker either. It doesn't reach the pressures of a stove top so cooking time is longer and you lose the ability to cool by conduction. That's before you start dealing with the inefficient external size to internal volume or the risks associated with two circuit boards not conformally coated. \n\nHow would you feel if you took your car to a mechanic who whipped out a Leatherman to work on your car?",

My son was never a picky eater so when he said he'd had it with the Dining Hall food I took him seriously, bought him a slow cooker, and told him how to make BBQ beef (beef was cheaper then). Before long he had a line of neighbors waiting outside his door. Then when they went on ski trips they took the slow cooker with them and made BBQ beef all day while they were skiing and came home to dinner rather than pay $$$ resort restaurant prices. Thus enters a lifelong cook. I am always so glad to see young people take up cooking. Cannot imagine a morer useful life skill.",

Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened and translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and jalape\u00f1o and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the chopped green chiles, cumin, onion powder, oregano and cayenne and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nTransfer the mixture to a 5- to 8-quart slow cooker. Add the chicken thighs to the pot. Stir in 3 cups of chicken broth and the beans. Cover and cook on low until the chicken is tender, 4 to 6 hours.\n\nIf chicken thighs are whole: remove them, take off the skin, shred meat from the bones, and return to the pot.\n\nIf thighs are skinless/boneless: shred them in the pot.\n\nAdd the frozen corn to the pot, stir, add the lid, and wait 10 minutes or until warm.\n\nServe with fresh cilantro and lime juice, and add salt to taste.\n\n(Adapted from NY Times [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019905-slow-cooker-white-chicken-chili?unlocked_article_code=3r7cuy-s5ike7gRt7uLtD_UFxvXWahJS6k5F6pANIgMI6o289HrcZKN8QZKADetBWL5GC_JyCrf9hpHJf0Wn_WHh9X0kJu2JyWZvyzxAjU0J8wF_8rK2d_U83jaMKevliiairLsfmpOAAvX7adc8_dM9ae-lJbdxHhxbwo0WlDIINoagsgubcPxAr8-d0Tu0rJJiU4o6PdScuvP7E8wBEsZHHKcPwq414oo3LGdthxWw4CaxLzs4Bp-xxh8yTtHXmZoUMaJKzhhbfGpcWCo1RYnPyxA30gxNOlSAJ5CjrYeCOe9CsFwkBYV7NmWExgx9XDl3xwq4vdbdurPg1fjWXFN5qBEM&amp;smid=share-url).)",

I don't find the need to add salt (and I like salt), which makes me feel like it's healthier. :-)\n\nThis weekend I used two whole chicken legs because they were what I had on hand, and I felt too lazy to bone and skin them. I just added them to the crockpot as-is. When the cooking was done, it was easy to slip the skin off and take the meat off the bones!\n\nIn the past, I've even used a half-breast (boneless/skinless) - just chucked it in the pot whole. It shredded easily when done cooking and stayed moist.\n\nI hope you enjoy this as much as I do!",

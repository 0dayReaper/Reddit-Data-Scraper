Add flour, stir to combine. The flour should stick to the onions and soak up all the fat. Add the spices and tomato paste. Stir to heat all up and get fragrant. (Careful not to scorch) move this mixture to the slow cooker. If the pan has a bunch suck in it use some of the chicken stock to deglaze the pan, pour this into the slow cooker as well",

Was too lazy to look it up so decided to make what I remembered. So I used spicy sausage, cheese tortellini, drained diced tomatoes with green chilies, a diced jalapeno, onion, carrot, celery, chicken broth, cream cheese, and spinach.\n\nLooking at the recipe now, I didn't actually make the original \"soup\" recipe at all, but man it turned out delicious!!! The only thing I think I'd change for next time is swap the spinach for kale, just to have it hold up a little better, but I felt the spinach was yummy anyway!\n\nI def r/ididnthaveeggs but it worked out in my favor!",

Which comes out great (though still needs to be ramped up on seasoning).  For that one you wait until the end when the chicken has cooked to add the dairy, Parmesan, spinach and tortellini and then you stir those aspects in until the spinach wilts and then serve.  Which results in the tortellini being perfectly cooked. Theoretically, you could do the same for the slow cooker version depending on how hot the liquid is but at that point, it may defeat the point of throwing everything in the slow cooker to be ready to go later",

Microwave for 5 minutes, stirring every 90 seconds or so. (The mixture will be pasty and look weird but don\u2019t worry it will all be okay in the end). Add the mixture to the slow cooker.\n\nAdd broth, tomatoes, chicken, salt and pepper to the slow cooker. Stir.\n\nCover and cook on LOW for 4-6 hours or on HIGH for 3-4 hours (or until chicken is very tender).\n\nRemove the lid use a fork to remove the chicken out of the slow cooker.  And add in tortellini and spinach, Parmesan cheese and warmed cream (cream should be warmed because it may cause curdling if added in cold).\n\nOn a cutting board, shred or cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. Add the chicken back into the slow cooker. Put the lid back on and cook on HIGH for about 10 more minutes, or until the tortellini are cooked through. Ladle into serving bowls and enjoy!",

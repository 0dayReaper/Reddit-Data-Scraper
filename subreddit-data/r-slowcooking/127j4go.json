Even dishes that don\u2019t have celery carrots or onion in them typically can still benefit from a mirepoix. A prime example being tomato soup. \n\nWhy would you assume someone that knows what a roux is knows what a mirepoix is? Or vice versa? They\u2019re not related at all besides both being basic/fundamental classical French techniques.\n\nThat\u2019s like saying if you know what a chiffonade is you should know what a pan deglaze is.

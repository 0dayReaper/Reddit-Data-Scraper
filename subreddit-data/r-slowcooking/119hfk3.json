I actually have had great luck with my sweet baked beans.\n\nSoak 3 cups (I have a large crockpot adjust as needed) of your favorite dry bean overnight or for at least 4 hours, heavily salt water and add a sprinkle of baking soda; then 2-4 cups of your favorite broth (i like beef for this); add to taste worchestershire sauce, catsup, mustard, apple cider vinegar, and dark brown sugar (or molasses and white sugar). I use roughly 1 tbsp, 2 tbsp, 1 tbsp, 1/4 cup, 1/2 cup respectively. I have added bell pepper, carrot and jalapeno to great success; haven't really experimented with other veggies but I'm sure others would be good as well. Cook 8-10 hours on low and enjoy! Makes a butt load of deliciousness. I also like spicy foods a lot so if that's your thing I have an Indian inspired bean and/or lentil curry recipe using garbanzos. Let me know but it's legit spicy not American spicy (has 3 types of chilis).",

Plants can't run or fight so they make toxins to poison predators, including humans.  Lectins and Oxalates are two which are very common in beans.  Soaking beans, long cooks can actually elevate lectins causing mostly digestive disturbances.  Eating beans with high lectin levels can cause the human gut to not absorb nutrients for several days.  This is one way how the plant defends itself by starving predators, (mostly insects).  Pressure cooking can practically eliminate lectins in beans, slow cooking won't.  Pressure cooking does not eliminate oxalates which are sharp crystals that can lodge themselves in any area of the body, mostly bones, joints, kidneys and bladder. \n\nSally Norton has a new book out on oxalates and the treatment for them.  They will build up in the body and can take years to eliminate.  She has several good discussions on YouTube you can get some information from.    Dr Gundry  is one of the experts on lectins.  Maybe check out some of his Youtube videos. \n\nI hope you get some resolution and your beans will taste wonderful.",

This is the best I\u2019ve got without those: \n\nsplit pea soup. \n\nIn a pressure cooker or crockpot combine:\n1T ghee (clarified butter-get at aldi, meijer, kroger, trader joes etc)\n1c each split green or yellow peas and brown lentils (NOT french/green -learned that the hard way ) \n4c water(more for thinner soup)\n4t better than bullion chicken, veg, or beef\n1T curry powder (store bought is not all the same)* see recipe below. be careful about ones with a lot of cinnamon. I dont think it tastes right with split peas\n1 cube frozen ginger (meijer, target,trader joes have)\n4 or 7oz canned diced green chilies if you like spicy\n2 bay leaves\n\nCurry powder:\n1/2t turmeric \n1t ground coriander, omit if you dont like\n1/2t ground ginger\n1/4t cumin\n1/2t ground black pepper \n1/4t cayenne if you like spice, more if you know what you\u2019re doing\n\nInstapot 15min, full natural release only, or slow cooker 6 hours on high. Stir in 2t to 2T lemon juice (fresh is best, start with 1t see if you like it-you should ;) just before serving stir in a handful of chopped fresh raw baby spinach.\n\nBonus: this recipe goes well with leftover bbq. Any ribs, roasted chicken, bbq beef, ham etc can get go into the pot.",

Black beans taste good as well. Adding bay leaves while cooking makes a difference. I also like to add black pepper, smoked paprika, oregano and parsley. The longer you cook the beans the better it tastes and incorporate the spices better. I am also vegetarian so sometimes I like to add vegan \"bacon\" too. Onion and garlic are kind of the soul of beens, but maybe this tips can help.",

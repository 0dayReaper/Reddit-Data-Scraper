I made it by cooking onion, garlic, shallot, and sundried tomatoes in the grease of the Italian sausage and it was beautiful. \n\nIt doesn't need to be a slow cooker recipe, it's pretty quick to make a disgustingly large pot of it on your stove. As soon as I read the first line of the actual recipe where it said \"microwave onions and basil for five minutes\" I noped straight the fuck out. Sounds absolutely revolting.",

I didn\u2019t substitute any of the fats or dairy, no low fat options, I used chicken thighs with fat. \n\nThe colour is rich. The chicken is in shreds it\u2019s so fallen apart. I used a generous amount of powdered chicken stock that\u2019s to my taste. Very generous scoop of garlic. \n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 fine. I find myself really disliking slow cooker food because I always find them very plain. I\u2019m not trying to be a hater or negative. I\u2019m not time poor so using a slow cooker to save time isn\u2019t important to me. \n\nWhy did my broth taste so bland? It tastes like slightly tangy cream. The best part was the cheese ravioli and it\u2019s from a packet from the supermarket. \n\nThank you \ud83d\udc95\n\nEDIT: I didn\u2019t expect this to garner so much attention, the Soup was a semi-viral recipe that\u2019s popular in this Reddit. [Here is the recipe which I should have included, apologies.](https://www.365daysofcrockpot.com/slow-cooker-tortellini-spinach-soup/)",

Subbing the chicken for sausage made a difference, but the cheese tortellini is just kinda gross, tbh. Too much buteric acid and it doesn\u2019t really complement the broth very well. Definitely holds up better in a high acid sauce with tomatoes. But frankly it\u2019s just not a terribly flavorful recipe.",

There's nothing wrong with that and they can make \"good\" food. Obviously taste buds differ, but to me a slow cooker is good for 'meat &amp; potatoes, midwestern cooking'. But beyond that and you're really trying to force a slow cooker out of its lane. I've made The Soup and the Pot Roast and they were perfectly adequate. Did I brag to any friends or post about it on the sub? No.\n \nI'll use the slow cooker when I want to make something simple and easy that will fill empty stomachs with some flavour. But when I want to show off my cooking, or make something that is really elevated and delicious, the slow cooker stays on its shelf in the pantry.\n \nA slow cooker is the opposite of fine dining. It is what it is and there's a place for it. I'm sure that someone, somewhere, has made some truly delicious, FineDining^TM quality food with it. But I don't know that those recipes are posted in this sub.",

I know when I looked at it, the combination of ingredients did seem a little bland to me. But it is, based on the reference to half and half, an American recipe and I find a lot of American recipes a little bland.\n\nI'd recommend slicing up some spicy chorizo or spicy italian sausage and adding that. Letting that percolate its way through the soup as it cooks should add some flavour and kick. (I do that for things like cream of mushroom soup and it works a treat.) I'd personally double the garlic and be a tad more generous with the pepper. Or with the tomato and cream base, you could also add some variation of ground coriander/ground cumin/garam masala/chilli powder and give it an Indian twist.",

Some of the dishes I had seen people exclaim are delicious\u2026 I have my doubts. Still seeing that Mississippi roast and gagging at all that butter. Imagine pouring 3/4 of a cup of oil on a fatty chuck roast. Weird right? Also the amount of unintentional soups I have seen because people insist on adding so much more liquid in their recipes. That\u2019s what made the \u201c24 hour roast\u201d so funny. It was like parody of r/slowcooking. \n\nthe problem is that people want \u201cthrown it in and walk away\u201d recipes then cook it all day. IMO that is almost never going to be a great dish, serviceable, but never great. In fact I think that using an oven safe Dutch oven for a lot of recipe\u2019s would turn out better. I made a braised pork roast with linguine the other day. I don\u2019t think it would have tasted as good in the crockpot.",

Here are some of the things I add to give the soup a bit of an \u201cumami\u201d bomb and yes some are a bit unusual that you can feel free to ignore.\n\n1. Reducing tomatoes into a paste or tomato paste prior to adding stock\n2. More Parmesan (although sometimes it ends up a little clumpy in the soup)\n3. Adding a few anchovies and cooking it down with the onions\n4. Teaspoon of fish sauce\n5. Teaspoon of MSG\n6. Some blend of powders including garlic, onion, or umami mushroom powder\n7. Bacon?",

Mississippi pot roast uses packaged ranch dressing, and that's about as flavorful as it gets. People, it's all about knowing your spices, herbs, and balancing the 5 tastes: sour, sweet, salt, bitter, and umami. It's combinations of those that combine for flavor.\n\nBut everyone just once pre-made this and pre-packaged that, and nothing has flavor. I was going to drop out of this subreddit, and this underscores why.\n\nSo long.",

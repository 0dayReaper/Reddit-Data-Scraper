Be careful with this since it can get salty. Adjust as you see fit.\n- Gochujang = maybe a third of a cup. This is spicy so adjust to your liking.\n- Soy Sauce (light) = 1/2 a cup.\n- Sugar = Just slightly under 1/2 cup.\n- Water = enough to make sure the entire mix is covered.\n- Ginger = About 5-6 large lengthwise slices (so they are easy to fish out later).\n- Garlic = I'd say 6-8 Bulbs (not heads) crushed.\n- Onions = 3 large. Add 1.5 of them at the beginning and the rest about 20 minutes before the dish finishes cooking.\n- Bay Leaves = 4-5 ought to do it.\n- Peppercorns = 10-12 pieces.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you also have some, add in Oyster Sauce. You can also throw in some mushrooms toward the end for extra umami.\n\nIf you have leftover gravy, you can cook rice noodles in them. Add some chopped green onions to the whole thing and you have a very quick noodle dish.",

As long as it tastes good to you, then that\u2019s the best damn way!\n\nNote: fond = brown yummy goodness - often confused with burnt seasonings though which can result in bitterness",

Once you've browned your meat, add a splash of boiling water to the pan to pull up any of the fond and then use that in your slow cooker as your stock, added bonus is you've pretty much cleaned your pot at the same time \ud83d\ude03.",

I also like bone on because the marrow enhances the flavor even more.  You can always trim the fat off afterwards.\n\nPotatoes, onion, and carrots and you have yourself a meal fit for a king.",

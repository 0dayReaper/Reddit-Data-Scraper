My dizzy spells were getting worse - scary even.  During that diet, I became diabetic.  \n\nI just want to warn people that if you start getting really bad dizzy spells, focal seizures, and sudden fainting spells, please see your doctor.  Studies are being done about keto diets possibly being linked to type 2 diabetes.  So please be careful.\n\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health-news/keto-diet-may-increase-type-2-diabetes-risk",

We also have a family friend who went on a keto diet and became diabetic as well, which was why I started looking it up.\n\nStrangely enough, they did not put me on a keto diet after becoming diabetic. My doctor told me to stop that diet, even though I had lost about 40 lbs.   I've talked to several doctors, including a neurosurgeon, who do not approve of that diet.  They said it is hard on your liver and kidneys.  I guess its some kind of acid involved with breaking down the proteins in meat.  \n\nMy doctor keeps telling me \"more fruits and vegetables\".   I just wanted to warn people in hopes that they might be careful with their health.  We're trying to do a good thing, but maybe it's not such a perfect path to take.",

My uncle who was an identical twin was diagnosed with diabetes about the same time his twin was. He ate this way, his twin didn\u2019t. His twin had both legs amputated and died at 60. My uncle faired very well. Lived to 79 and never had any bad effects from the disease until a little before he died, started losing eyesight. He died shortly after this started happening.\n\nSo does your dr recommend not eating meat?",

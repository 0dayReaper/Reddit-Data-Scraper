    "postText": "I have to assume that this has been done?? I want to make ahead about 10-12 breakfast burritos for a camping trip next weekend. Was thinking it might be nice to plug in the slow cooker and reheat the burritos for a small crowd from frozen overnight. Has anyone tried this? Was it successful? Not asking about food safety, asking about if they will withstand the reheat process and be yummy still\n\nEdited to add that I'd prep and freeeze in foil beforehand",

What I'm trying to do is come up with a slow cooker breakfast meal that involves as little prep on site as possible, and bonus if I can prep ahead . We will be in eastern Wa 'deserty' type terrain with a bunch of people who are dry camping but we all have generators. I like the slow cooker idea b/c it means using less water to wash up after meal prep, since we are limted on potable water. \n\nMakes sense the burritos might get soggy, didn't consider that - thank you! Back to the drawing board",

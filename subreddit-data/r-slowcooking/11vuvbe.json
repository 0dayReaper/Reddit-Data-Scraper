    "postText": "I'm exceptionally overweight and I've been ignoring my health for too long, especially since having my gall-bladder removed for gallstones. I know I need to be mindful of what I eat now and I want to lose weight too! I'm currently at a BMI of 36 (Female, UK).\n\nI'm in a very active job that requires a lot of pulling and lifting heavy items and I cycle to work now. I'm also beginning to make plans to do workouts at home too. However, I know my relationship with food needs to change too. I enjoy healthy food, but I am admittedly lazy and prefer to snack rather than do lots of prep. I don't want to continue this behaviour in front of my kids, so I want to use the slow cooker more often to easily prep great meals!\n\nWhat are some healthy, family friendly recipes for the slow cooker that you can recommend? Thank you in advance!",

I recently switched my diet up due to fatty liver syndrome so I haven\u2019t found a lot of slow cooker recipes that fit the \u201cMediterranean diet\u201d I got put on.  The best is probably overnight beans though, being in the UK I\u2019m sure you already have better recipes then me on those \ud83d\ude02",

Like some natural Yoghurt or skyr with some fruits as a sweet snack or replacing oily dressings with a yoghurt based one for salads. Personally I really like veggies so I like to pair them with some meat or just pan roasted veggies with a yoghurt dip (natural yoghurt with some herbs, salt, pepper and some garlic).\n\nWish you lots of success with your journey and don't give up! You got this!",

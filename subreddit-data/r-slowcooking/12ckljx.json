            "comment": "To achieve tender, juicy short ribs without drying them out, it's important to find the right balance of cooking time and temperature. Cooking short ribs on low in a slow cooker typically takes around 6-8 hours. This allows the connective tissues to break down and the meat to become tender while retaining moisture.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, it's essential to monitor the internal temperature of the short ribs to ensure they don't overcook. A reliable thermometer can be an invaluable tool for this purpose. Aim for an internal temperature of around 190-205\u00b0F (88-96\u00b0C) for that perfect tenderness. \r  \n\r  \nIn summary, cook your short ribs on low in a slow cooker for 6-8 hours, and use a reliable thermometer like [ChefsTemp](https://www.chefstemp.com/) to monitor the internal temperature to ensure tender, juicy results. Happy cooking!",

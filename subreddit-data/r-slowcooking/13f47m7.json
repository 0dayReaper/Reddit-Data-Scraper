Though I do like Olive and Grapeseed Oil occasionally.\n\nThe title is problematic due to the combination. Just tried to convey the gist of the meal. Though this might be of some relevance - \n\n\"Butter Chicken, akin to it's British sibling, is a blend tender chicken chunks and a curry sauce. However, like Chicken Tikka Masala and most Indian curries,\u00a0its base doesn't begin with an onion and ginger garlic paste, but rather tomatoes that are then cooked in butter and not oil.\"\n\nExcerpt from - https://www.littleindiadowntowndenver.com/chicken-tikka-masala-vs-butter-chicken#:~:text=Butter%20Chicken%2C%20akin%20to%20it's,in%20butter%20and%20not%20oil.",

In my last place I had a small fridge though living in a 3x3 metre unit means the noise levels from the compressor can really affect sleep, especially when it switches off and has that ice cracking sound. Often my food would run out by Monday anyway, so I found it of little use. Things like Ice Cream etc I've never really taken to. \n\nAlso I live within an 8 minute walk to a small supermarket so I tend to just plan my purchases carefully. I am susceptible to ice cold energy drinks when I head out though.",

You'll be getting a smoker yet. \n\nFor pork ribs, I really like the cheap \"Tennessee\" rub you can get from coles, real simple. \n\nFollow 3-2-1 rib method: 3 hours at 120C, cover for 2 hours with liquid, finish open for 1 hour.",

Cover ribs with rub, put it in a vacuum sealed bag.\n\nHeat water to 165F, and put ribs in it. \n\nI cooked mine for 24 hours, then dried them off and basted them with sauce, and put them under the broiler.\n\nThe meat was falling apart just by brushing the sauce on. If you tried to pick up a bone, it would just slide out. Easily the most tender and delicious ribs I've ever had. Could easily cook it for less time if you want more texture but damn those ribs practically melted.",

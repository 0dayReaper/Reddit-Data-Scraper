            "comment": "Frozen things tend to get freezer burn after a while in the freezer.\n\nItems that are exposed to air or pockets of air will be \"burnt\", causing the surface to take on a very bad smell / taste and texture. This is because the cold freezer temperature dries out the air entirely, and that basically rapidly dehydrates the frozen food item's surface, causing a burn-like look and texture.\n\nOnly vacuum sealing prevents that because air is removed, and the plastic bag squeezes against the surface of the item, removing the surface's contact with any air whatsoever. This prevents dehydration / freezer burn. This works very well with raw meat, etc.\n\nThis clearly won't work with beans, as your bag can't possibly wrap around and cover every millimetre of every single bean.\n\nSo yes, you should keep the broth together with the beans when freezing. The liquid will encapsulate and freeze around each individual bean, protecting them from freezer burn. (liquids can't \"burn\")\n\nNot for \"superior texture\", but rather to avoid an inferior texture.",

            "comment": "Notes: \n\nThis was amazing.  The pork chops were tender and fell off the bone in large twnder chunks. The braising liquid isn't pretty,  The lemon turned the milk into a rough ricotta. Frankie spooned the curds on top but honestly, Im not a fan of curds, so I just stirred those into my polenta as part of it's cooking liquid. They became part of the polenta and added some of extra flavor\n\nNormally, I'm not part of the you have to sear before slow cooking meat, but in this case it's necessary. Those brown bits really added texture and flavor. I would not skip this step, but if you do make this, and skip it love to hear about it. \n\n\nI used Kathy Hester's \"Pumpkin Polenta\" as a launching pad without the pumpkin, but honestly a little extra sage and keeping the  pumpkin savory would have made it even better. A perfect fall meal. \n\nYou can make Polenta  on the stove or use Martha Stewart's oven polenta if you want. I'm lazy and hate making polenta on the stove so my slow cooker worked well. I poured a little dish of liquid ion my pork and kept it warm in the oven at 175 F while the polenta cooked . It didn't dry out. \n\nSorry I didn't take slow cooker pics,I forgot.\n\nBut yeah, this is really a A+ recipe",

There\u2019s a recipe that calls for milk and tons of garlic too that Jamie Oliver does in the oven with chicken. I bet you could do it in a slow cooker too. Was it just a standard polenta recipe you used?",

As I consider the slow cookers primary function is to braise meats and beans in tasty liquids, I'll bet you're right, you could make the chicken in the slow cooker. \n\nBob's red mill gluten free yellow grits/polenta. I've used fine grain out of my co- op's bulk bin and standard Quaker oats yellow cornmeal grits in the slow cooker.  They all work pretty well in slow cooker on high. I do wander over and stir it at least once or twice to check on liquid and lumps but it's super hands off as opposed to stovetop version.",

Add garlic pieces and cook for one minute, remove and add to 3-4 quart slowcooker insert, set aside \n\nSeason your pork chops with salt and pepper . Sear pork chops in the oil , browning on all sides. Add to insert with pan drippings. \n\nAdd milk, broth or water plus bouillon. Add the lemon peel, just of lemon halves, sage and thyme. Taste broth (if you want, I get safety issues, you can season after too ) for salt and pepper and adjust.\n\nCook on low for 6-8 hours ( 6-7 is ideal) Remove bay leaf and large garlic cloves, and lemon from sauce. Remove bones and meat. Set in a keep warm oven covered. Reserve the liquid\n\nPolenta-Slow cooker\n\n1/3 yellow grits or Polenta\n\n1 cup of the braising liquid from pork, milk curds included\n\n1 cup water or milk I used water\n\nWipe out insert of 3 quart slow cooker and apply a liberal coat of non stick oil spray or butter .\nIn greased slow cooker add polenta  and liquids , stir to combine cook on high for 1 hour stirring about halfway through. Grits are done when it turns creamy.add 1 tablespoon of butter or olive oil, ( I used butter) and if you'd like about 1/2 cup of melting cheese such as mozzarella or 1/2 cup paramasan. Or you can add both. Stir until cheese melts and add more salt and pepper to taste.\n\nTo serve: spoon polenta in a bowl and top with the pork, it should fall off the bone. You can top with parsley or chiffonaded, basil if you'd like. It's a bit yellow/beige.",

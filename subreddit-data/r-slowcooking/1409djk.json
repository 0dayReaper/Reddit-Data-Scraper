    "postText": "Meat: Rub 2.8kg beef chuck roast with salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin, cinnamon, thyme, smoked paprika, allspice, bay leaf, cloves, organo, dried jallapenios and marinate overnight. \n\nPlace the meat in the slow cooker with 2 quartered onions, 5 fresh green chillies, 2 dried ancho chillies, 2 chipotle chillies and 500ml orange juice and cook on low for 8 hours\n\nAt the end of the cooking time, remove the meat, chop it up and mix with some of the gravy.\n\nTomato salsa: Put 6 tomatoes, 1 pointed pepper, 2 habanero in a small saucepan, fill with water and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Then remove everything from the water and puree with two cloves of garlic (possibly add some of the cooking water if too thick). Put the pureed salsa back into a saucepan and season with salt, pepper, paprika, cumin, cinnamon, chili powder, allspice and cloves and simmer until no more foam can be seen. Now fill the hot salsa directly into small, clean mason jars, close them and turn them upside down so they can be stored for some time (a vacuum should form and pop when opened). \n\nGuacamole: Mash 6 avocados with a potato masher and the juice of one lime. Add 2 chopped medium tomatoes, 2 crushed garlic cloves and season with salt and pepper.\n\nAdd to that, tortilla, grated cheese (I like Turkish Taze Kasar), chopped fresh cilantro, and finely chopped onions.",

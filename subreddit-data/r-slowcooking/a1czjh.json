I was a little worried due to the 1/2 tsp cayenne (and the sheer amount of other spices) but it turned out great-a lot like our local place. \n\nI did sear the chicken and cook the onions like the recipe encourages (but does not require). And the only difference I would make next time would be to add a little extra yogurt or maybe extra cream  because although it did taste like our local place it may have been a little less creamy than theirs.  \n\nI\u2019ve made the rice before - I love the recipe I usually add peas and use stock instead of the extra water (I make the saffron tea according to the recipe but then use stock for the rest of required water). It\u2019s great. \n\nFirst time with the naan too - it was good enough to make again and again but not restaurant quality. I\u2019ll have to keep experimenting (likely my skills? Or a certain type of cooking surface I need? I used cast iron). It was definitely good but not as good as the local place. ",

So in india, butter chicken is just called butter chicken and mutton rogan josh is called just that, rogan josh.\n\nIt's not something you need to actually worry about, but hey, the more you know :)",

I also added a chopped and seeded jalape\u00f1o (because I saw another tikka recipe used one).  You may also have a great Indian place by your house that does something different/special in their recipe. I think this recipe is close to the places by me if you\u2019re not afraid to add some more spice. ",

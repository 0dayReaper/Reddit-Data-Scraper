You could elevate the meat off the bottom to avoid it stewing in its own juices and broil when finished to crisp it up and that'd probably be the closest.",

Slather that stuff all over your meat before adding it to the slow cooker and don't add any other liquids. As others said, keep the meat elevated off the bottom. It's about as close as you'll get to real  'smoker' taste from a slow cooker.",

You might be able to cover your pork butt with a rub and cover the bottom with dried herbs and whole spices, but I don\u2019t know that it will do more than release essential oils from them. I\u2019m pretty sure they won\u2019t generate smoke, but I could be wrong. Any which way, the pork butt itself will release liquid (fat and internal moisture), so you may want to insert a rack or make a foil snake to keep the meat off the bottom of your slow cooker. I really don\u2019t know if it will work, but if you have a probe thermometer which will go off at a pre-set temp, give it a whirl.",

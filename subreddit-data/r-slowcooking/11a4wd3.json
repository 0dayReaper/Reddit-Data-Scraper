    "postText": "Hi all, I will preface this by saying I'm a terrible cook naturally so please bear with me \ud83d\ude05 \nI got a new slow cooker that arrived today and plan to make a surprise dinner for my flatmates this weekend when they get home. (I will be out so wanted it to be ready and a nice surprise for them when they walk through the door) \nThe curry is a carribean adaptation that my flatmate has made before, with chicken thighs, potato, onion and the relevant spices etc, she doesn't tend to add any other veg. \nI'm a bit worried about the liquid element to the curry, especially as I won't be at home to check it/thicken it so I was thinking to use coconut milk instead of stock and maybe just adding a gelatine stock on its own for flavour, but if I'm using about 4 thighs, plus the potato chunks, will one can of coconut milk be enough? Could it be too much? \nAgain I'm a crappy cook and I've never actually observed this recipe or what my flatmate does re. Liquid ratios, and it's meant to be a surprise so I can't ask her. Plus I made a beef curry before that was basically water and I had to add cornflour which made it taste bland af. \n\nAny advice or general rules of thumb for liquid:ingredient ratios in curry's would be super appreciated. I plan to cook it for about 7-8 hours, and won't be around to check on it from probably hour 1.5 onwards. Thanks in advance \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "I think what you need to consider here is that you're not really going to lose any liquid through evaporation, and what ratios to use depends on how liquid you like the sauce to be.\n\nI'm finding it hard to picture what you have as a starting point, especially with the addition of the potato. So what I would suggest it that you take a view when you get it all into the pot, if it looks a little thick - add some water or stock. If it looks a little watery, you could add a thickener nearer to serving time. \n\nI don't think you're going to burn anything with too little liquid as long as you have at least enough, and it's easy to thicken up a sauce later as well.\n\nIf in doubt add a bit more liquid, then consider a thickener later.\n\nAs a general point, you want to make sure that the meat and anything else is mostly covered in liquid.\n\nIn terms of enhancing the flavour - while you can absolutely just dump the ingredients into the pot and set it off, you will get much tastier results if you take the time to do the prep beforehand such as browning the meat and even caramelising the vegetables. I heard somewhere that it's 'brown' that adds flavours to dishes, this holds especially true for slow cooker ones. If you have an opportunity to add browning to the recipe it will pay dividends.",

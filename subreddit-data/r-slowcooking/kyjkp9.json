I\u2019m sure it would be delicious, but for the price tag I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019s worth it when there are other, cheaper cuts of meat that would arguably hold up better for slow cooking. If you\u2019re looking for something a bit fancier than chuck, I\u2019d try beef short ribs. They hold up really well for long cooking and have a ton of fat and keep a lot of moisture, plus they give the sauce a ton of flavour. If you\u2019re down for a bit more work, I also think beef shank (osso buco) would work amazingly in a chilli, as you also have the bone marrow that will melt into the sauce and provide great flavour and body. Only problem is you\u2019ll have to go through and pick out the bones afterwards! Good luck!",

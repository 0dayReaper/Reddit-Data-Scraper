            "comment": "If it's beef or pork you can ALWAYS rescue tough meat by turning it into BBQ to eat on buns. Cook the meat in sauce, long and slow and plenty of sauce, either in a slow cooker or just a covered baking dish in the oven (the cover can be aluminum foil but make it as air-tight as you can). For the sauce use a can of plain tomato sauce then fill the same can with water and dump it in the pot,  1 tsp salt unless you already salted the meat in which case use less salt), Add a chopped onion, a chopped green pepper if you have one, 1 tsp garlic powder, AND: 1/3 cup white vinegar, 1/3 cup brown sugat, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp clove (do not even think of not using the vinegar, brown sugar, cinnamon, and clove as they are the soul of this adventure). Slow cooker for 2 hours on high or in oven in covered dish or pan for 2 hours at 350. After that tear the meat up with a couple of forks.  Taste and correct the seasoning. If you don't need BBQ right now you can freeze it for future use.",

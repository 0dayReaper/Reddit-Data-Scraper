I always sear pieces of liver when I'm making liver and onions for a family member who enjoys it (I don't enjoy it, but it's a great healthy freezer/microwave meal for the rotation for said elderly family member) but I think that's because I flour it first.\n\nIt has been said by my sister (mother of boys, I promise its relevant) that sausage casserole made with sausages that have been seared looks like it has boiled w#llies floating in it...",

            "comment": "Searing does not help to retain juices. This is a culinary myth.\n\nSearing *does* help to create flavor, both with the browning of the meat itself, and the left behind brown bits in the pan/pot. The latter is called fond, and it can be released by deglazing the pan with some liquid (often wine, but plain ol water or stock work fine). \n\nAs to the question of *should* you sear? It's up to you. If you're braising you'll develop additional flavor, at the cost of additional work. If you're doing something like barbecue on a smoker then it's probably not worth bothering with, the meat will develop a sort of crust on its own.",

Just make sure to heat up your pan properly and give each side a good sear before placing it in the slow cooker. Trust me, it's worth the extra effort!",

The difference is the slow cooker has a metal cooking vessel, usually Teflon inside.\nI like this better than a crock pot because I can take the cooking vessel off of the slow cooker and put it right on the burner to sear the meat. Take it off the burner and put it back on the heated base and now you have all the amazing juices from searing right in your pot.\nDon't get me wrong, slow cookers and crock pots both have their place. I just prefer the slow cookers.",

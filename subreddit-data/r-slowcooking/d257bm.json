If you cook on high, which you should only use for reheating, longer than you should, then it boils and bubbles and smell escapes.

I adapted [this recipe](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a22852473/slow-cooker-chicken-tikka-masala-recipe/) which seems to be the most popular around here.\n\nI added broccolini and cauliflower, upped the spice quantities a little, and added extra tomatoes and a bit of chicken stock. My eye-balling is usually rat shit so I just compensated with a shitload of salt and cumin cause how can you go wrong. Also don't ever use cheap masala cause it's basically the entire meal. Go to an Indian store if you can\n\nI marinated the chicken overnight (just in yoghurt, salt, pepper and a bit of coriander stem - though I'd probably put some spice in the marinade next time) and sauteed the garlic and onion... and I may have added 2 extra cloves of garlic cause that shit is crack. \n\nAlso I used smoked paprika cause it's the closest I'll ever get to owning a tandoor oven and that's a somewhat sombre realisation\n\nHad to cook it on high cause of time but ran it for about 3 hours and that was plenty. Threw in some peas when I added the cream. Was pretty surprised that the chicken wasn't stringly considering I used chicken breast. Think the shorter cook time and the marinating helped a shit tonne. And probably the kilo of salt. \n\nIt wasn't ready until 9:30pm so we wolfed it down straight away in front of Killing Eve, but I'll snap a pick of the leftovers tomorrow if Sandra Oh doesn't distract me again with her scintillating wit.",

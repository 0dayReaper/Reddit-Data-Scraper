Throw into crock pot \n- Put chopped up butternut into crockpot\n- Add 2 cups of chicken stock, add the rest of your spices in here. I use hot water to make it blend together easier. \n- Stir and leave on high for 3 and a half hours or until you can squish the butternut with a fork. \n- Put into blender and blend until smooth \n- Add coconut milk and enjoy! \n- I like to put a small teaspoon of cream/sour cream/coconut milk to serve and add some arugula. I also serve it with bread!",

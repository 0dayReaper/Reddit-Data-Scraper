Can take out last minute and pour some teriyaki, bbq, salsa over and defrost in fridge. You have a last minute rice bowl ingredient. Can also add frozen to cold leftover rice and make chicken fried rice. Can't go wrong with frozen shredded cooked chick on stand by in the freezer.",

Stir fry with veg and soy sauce or teriyaki. You can keep the chicken plain and add store bought or homemade marinades, dressings, vinaigrette\u2019s, aiolis, sauces, etc to make whatever type of flavor profile is sounding yummy",

Cover and bake for about 40 minutes. Take the cover off and brown the top part. Let cool a bit and serve. Or you could make up a couple of these and freeze them with out baking to take out later for a nice quick hot meal. \n\nCould also do this with potatoes or rice instead.",

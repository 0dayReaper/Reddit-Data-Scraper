Hadn't tried lotus root before and with the first day of winter here today seemed a grand idea to get the health up for the cold night ahead. \n\nHad various other ingredients I wanted to incorporate but limited to my 1.5 litre Slow Cooker thought it best they be added to the leftovers - canned mushroom with butter sauce, black olives and edam cheese. Otherwise great for toasted sandwiches. Slow cooked : \n\n500g chicken breast - filleted across the centre then into thick strips.\n\n200g lotus root slices\n\nBlack sesame 1tsp, rosemary 2tsp, basil 2tsp stirred into ~\n\nPacket - chicken gravy + cup boiled water\n\nPacket - 4 cheese sauce + cup boiled water\n\nLeft to go on low for 3 hours, then flipped to high for another 30 minutes while I prepped 3 layers of leek stem sliced and grilled with olive oil. A decent amount of mesclun finely chopped and placed as a bed. Then poured about half the mix over top.",

I'd definitely cook it again and lucking it with gravy was a really nice way to have it. I've just put the last of it in with pasta and a Gumbo mix.",

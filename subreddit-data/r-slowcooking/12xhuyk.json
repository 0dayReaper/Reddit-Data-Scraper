Just the opposite of a microwave or an air fryer.\n\nIf you warm your Crock Pot on high for an hour ahead of time think of it as having an oven set for warm.  Then you can put your food in there and it will take some time but it will at least get warm eventually.  Since the food wasn't designed to be cooked that way it could turn out really bad.",

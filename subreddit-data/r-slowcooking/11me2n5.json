I often use little samples off to the side since some of my experiments are good, but some don't blend in very well.  That way, you could toss the samples out and not waste the whole dish.\n\nExample:  I wanted to spruce up my candied yams, so I took a little sample and tried a squeeze of fresh orange juice and sprinkled a little extra cinnamon in the sauce sample.  Yep, those went good.  Someone told me a touch of bourbon went well with that dish, so I later tried that too.  Now we're all pleased with it.  \n\nRecipes start out as a base for me.  I often wonder what else can I add to make it even better.",

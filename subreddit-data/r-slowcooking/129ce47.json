            "comment": "My mystery stroganoff recipe, aka made it up today, did my best to write it down. Picture was taken after I took two servings out, I was too hungry to take a picture.\n\n\nIntended for a large crock pot.\n\n\n8 Small dried shiitake mushrooms\n1L Beef stock\n\n\n4 Large fresh chorizo sausages or some paprika heavy fresh sausage.\n800g Chuck Steak ~nice and fatty not lean\nGarlic mince several bulbs? (like it was about 4 large and 3 tiny tiny ones)\nTwo large handfuls of button mushrooms\nGood generous squeeze of tomato paste\n\nSpices to taste this is what I used,\nFreshly grind:\nCumin,\nCoriander,\nFennel,\n**Hot** chilli flake\n\nSweet smoked paprika\n\n\n2 Large sticks of celery diced fine,\n1 Large capsicum diced fine,\n2 Medium carrots diced fine,\n2 Medium Leeks halved lengthwise cleaned and cut into slices,\n1/2 of a giant onion diced fine ~seriously local Asian grocer has stupid large onions it\u2019s fantastic\n\n\nTo finish\nHot English dried mustard powder.\n250g tub of full fat sour cream.\n\n\nIn a small pot very, very, gently simmer your dried mushrooms and beef stock. Leave to simmer while you do the rest of the prep.\n\nTurn on you crock pot to start warming:\n\n\nInto the crock pot add:\nChuck steak diced into bite sized pieces.\nHalf or quartered button mushrooms.\nAll spices.\nGarlic.\n\nIn the pot you intended to fry off your vegetables, fry off the 4 sausages in a little oil till they are firm. Remove and leave to cool enough to be able to slice into bite sized slices, add to the crock pot.\n\n\n\nThen to that pot with the delicious sausage fat and oil fry off all veg till softened down. Then add to the crock pot.\n\n\nDrain the shitake mushroom and beef stock through a fine sieve into the crock pot. Gently press the mushroom to get out extra moisture. Once mushrooms are cool, finely dice and add to the crock pot.\n\n\nTop up crock pot with boiling water till it just hits the top of the ingredients\n\n\nCook till tender and finish with sour cream and mustard powder, and if need be some cornstarch and water to thicken.\n\n\nServe with whatever carbs take your fancy.",

Never realized this about Shitakes. Just word of warning about this certain type of mushrooms. Did it turn out sweet?",

But us kiwi's have weird things like canned spaghetti ham Hawaiian toast pizzas, so ehh, take what you want from this.\n\n~churr",

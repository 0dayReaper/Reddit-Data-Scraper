            "comment": "Most recipes I have seen that are for the slow cooker and use pasta, say to add the pasta during the last bit of cooking. Some say 20 minutes, some say an hour. It depends on what\u2019s in the cooker and what type of pasta. If you have the pasta in there for the full 8 hours, I think most pasta would be mush by the end of cooking.",

            "comment": "I think a slow cooker would make pasta mushy. You could probably cook a small amount (1/2 lb or less) in your kettle, assuming you can clean it afterwards.\n\nIf you twisted my arm and told me I had to make a full pound of pasta in a slow cooker,  I would set the slow cooker to high while boiling a full pot of water in the kettle. Then add all the water and pasta to the slow cooker, and cook until done. I would probably start checking the pasta for doneness at the 5-8 minute mark, depending on the shape.",

Then, serve them over ramen noodles you've soaked for a minute or two in boiled water from your kettle. You could also use the seasoning packet from the ramen on the meat &amp; veggies to save some extra money and have no waste.",

If it\u2019s not cooked enough at the end of that time, drain the water and replace with fresh boiled water then test a bit every few minutes until it\u2019s cooked enough. This will work much better than the slow cooker and be faster as well.",

Fresh pasta only needs to boil a very very short time, like two to three minutes max. You can use the slowcooker only for the sauce and the kettle for cooking the pasta at the very last moment. Tastewise this would be your best option and be delicious. Fresh pasta is really easy to make.",

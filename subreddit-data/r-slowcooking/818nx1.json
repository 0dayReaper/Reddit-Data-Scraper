            "comment": "I made this for my wife, who is home sick with the flu. It's my twist on the recipe that got me to sub here, [Crispy Pork Ramen](https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/2o7qk8/crockpot_crispy_caramelized_pork_ramen_noodle_soup/). I used beef because my wife can't eat pork. I added strips of wagyu short rib on top, some curry roasted pumpkin and oven roasted capsicum to give it some green and to balance out the heat a little. The egg I cooked in my sous vide, but I pulled it out a little early so... it was still awesome.\n\n**The Recipe**\n\n500gm gravy or casserole beef\n\n1L salt reduced beef stock\n\n1/3 cup rice wine vinegar\n\n1/3 cup soy sauce\n\nA splashing of fish sauce\n\nA big squeeze of Sriracha\n\n2 tablespoons of red curry paste\n\n1 tablespoon of minced garlic\n\n1 tablespoon of minced chilli\n\n1 lime, juiced\n\na dash of chinese five spice\n\nA bit of salt and pepper to taste\n\na tiny touch of sesame oil\n\n1 packet of ramen per diner (makes about 4 meals)\n\n2 onions, sliced\n\nPlace the meat in first. Combine the rest of the above (except the noodles) in the slow cooker. Turn on and walk away for 7 hours. At 7 hours, get the now broken down beef out and shred it. Taste the broth and panic thinking it's too spicy for your wife. Add another 250mls or so of Chicken stock because it's all you have on hand. Cook the noodles for 2 mins like packet noodles.\n\n**The Toppings**\n\nA massive wagyu short rib I found on sale at the butchers\n\n1/4 kent pumpkin, curry powder, brown sugar, salt and pepper\n\n1 green capscium, halved\n\n4 eggs\n\nThe short rib is easy peasy. Chuck your oven on 90C (or as low as it goes) and leave it alone for 2 hours. Take it out and taste a bit, and seriously consider throwing everything else out. Don't do this, you can still eat this thing and the other stuff. About 20 minutes before it's ready to rock, get your bbq (grill) really hot and sear this bad boy on either side. Needs like 2 minutes tops if you bbq is hot enough. Let it rest for 10 mins before slicing.\n\nFor the pumpkin and the capsicum, also easy. Bung the oven up to 220C. Slice the pumpkin thin and cover both your slices and the capsicum in olive oil. Spread the curry powder mixture on the pumpkin. Sprinkle salt on the capscium. Put in the oven for 40ish minutes. Take the capsicum out at about 30 mins and let it sit under cling wrap or foil or something, so the steam makes the skins easy to remove (nobody wants to eat roasted capsicum skin).\n\nFor the eggs, put them in before the pumpkin, not after like I did, and then take them out after you've done everything else. I sous videded them because I can't ever seem to boil an egg properly. I dunno. I can't even sous vide them properly so... Anyway, a poached egg was surprisingly good in this dish.\n\n**End thoughts**\n\nIt was absolutely amazing. Only thing I'd change is I'd probably go diced like in the original recipe, because it was a bit hard to get everything in one mouthful. I'd also learn to cook eggs and not go quite so gungho with the sriracha next time, but I'd add chicken stock last minute again. Not sure why but it seemed to undercut the acid. Maybe it just diluted it? Also no need to grab the wagyu short rib, although short rib is 100% the best cut for what you're trying to achieve here. Just grabbed it because it was on crazy special, and now I have 3/4 of a kilo of it left.\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "This ramen sounds amazing, but here's my problem with calling this a slow cooker recipe. You are using multiple cooking sources: slow cooker for broth, oven for ribs, then increasing the oven temp to roast pumpkin, a grill to sear the rib meat, sous vide or pot to poach eggs. At this point, I'd almost rather make the broth in a pot or dutch oven, simmering for a couple hours instead of 7, since all the other steps add up to a few hours of cooking.\n\nThat may just be me, but if I'm \"actively\" cooking, I want all my steps to come together at the same time. If I'm using a slow cooker, I want to put it all in and forget about it for 4-8 hours and then have it ready to serve or at most need a half hour after adding ingredients (dairy, fresh herbs, adjusting seasoning, etc.)\n\nBut really, your picture looks amazing, and I'm definitely going to try a version of this, minus the spiciness because my wife can not eat spicy food.",

If only because getting the beef to break down without burning in a dutch oven would have turned it into a three hour long affair pocked with intervals of panic about the meat in the broth.\n\nStill, when I think slowcooking I definitely think fire and forget so I get this criticism.",

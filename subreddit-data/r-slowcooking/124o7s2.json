    "postText": "I have a chicken thigh recipe I wanna try out but I've never slow-cooked them and just had a couple of questions. Like should I add a thin layer of chicken stock or duck fat so they don't get stuck to the bottom? Should I get some thighs with skin on them and sear the skin so it's crispy? And should I get bone-in for flavor? Any tips would be appreciated, and recipes too if you'd like!",

Still easy to shred, but the meat doesn\u2019t get to the point where it\u2019s fall apart and dry at the same time. Same 4h for drumsticks.  Wings about 2-3 hours (and then broil for a few min each side).",

Also, if you\u2019re adding it to broth with rice or other ingredients, trim the the excess skin - you know the flappy thick parts - because it will make your dish very greasy.   You won\u2019t need extra fat.  Avoid slow cooking boneless skinless because they just shrink up into a dry ball of yuk.",

I find that thighs stay tender thru slow cooking whereas breasts become hard and dry. Although if thighs are overcooked they can disintegrate into a fibrous mess.",

I obviously couldn't taste it but husband said it was really good and 8 month old baby wolfed down some of it blended up. I was paranoid that there wasn't any liquid put into the slow cooker but it's not long before liquid comes out of the chicken.",

I felt pretty meh about it, BUT I think this one is popular because it is relatively cheap, hard to screw up, comfort food that is wildly customizable. For ppl who are starting cooking and may be intimidated by the process or someone who just want a simple weeknight recipe it is amazing. Its a great place to start if you want to start crockpoting.",

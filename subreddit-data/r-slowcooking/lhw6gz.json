I also quartered my onion and then pulled it out as a final prep (I love carrots and not so much onions)... but otherwise executed the recipe faithfully. \n\nI will be keeping this one! Rich and delicious! \n\nEDIT: to clarify, it's served over smashed potatoes \n\nSECOND EDIT: I've just been reminded that I ended up dumping the whole 6oz can of tomato paste in, because I didn't want to fuss with the leftover amount... sorry. \n\nCRITICAL EDIT: OMG... I'm so used to omitting pork from any recipe I don't even register it anymore! I am SO sorry...I didn't use the bacon. \n\nAlso... holy hell! Thank you for all the love! \n\nhttps://www.recipetineats.com/irish-beef-and-guinness-stew/",

That may seem like a lot at first but they completely dissolve becoming part of the broth. It gives the stew some lovely rich flavors and is less heavy handed than flour at creating the right consistency.",

I know this is from the beer but does anyone else find the same, and how do you balance this? Wondered if e.g. a bit of honey would help? I know carrots add some natural sugars but this doesn't seem to make much difference. As much as I love a good ale, for stews like this I tend to use red wine rather than beer because of that bitterness.",

I've had ales take over completely... less so with ciders. \n\nI'm convinced Guinness is magic.",

            "comment": "Look for a higher end multicooker with an actual temperature sensor.  The base model Instant Pot, for example, relies on a single pressure sensor for all of its cooking modes.  This is fine for pressure cooking or above-boiling-point cooking (rice), but terrible for slow cooking.   The Instant Pot Max has both pressure and temperature sensors, as do other premium models from other brands.  A \"sous vide\" function is usually a good indicator that there's a temperature sensor on board.",

I needed a good quality slow cooker, and my wife needed a pressure cooker, so was happy to find one that does both really well, been using it for both functions for the past year or so and no complaints so far.  I guess it has lots of other features, just haven't explored them yet.\n\nEDIT: Before you ask, I use the slow cooker mainly for a nihari, which is just perfectly cooked in this, not sure how it compares to other slow cookers and their wide bases, but it definitely has enough space for lamb shanks and beef shin.",

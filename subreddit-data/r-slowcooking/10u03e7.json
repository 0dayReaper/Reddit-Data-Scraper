Only salt after you have softened the meat and reduced the sauce a bit so you get a better feel for the seasoning.\n\nI use whole spices and dry toast them in a pan and chuck them in a spice grinder/coffee grinder and make it fresh.\n\nI tend to run on high for 2 hours and then then low and slow for the next 4ish hours??\n\nSorry I can't offer better recipe it's all by feel.\n\nServe with your carb choice, we having it with spiral pasta.",

    "postText": "I always love making stews and curries and prefer meat melt-in-the-mouth (who doesn\u2019t though). Wouldn\u2019t mind trying soup also. And other things I usually eat like bolognese and pulled pork. I want to get a slow cooker but have a few questions before I do\u2026\n\n- I don\u2019t want to prepare in the morning. I just won\u2019t have time. I\u2019ve seen slow cookers with programmable timers, would this be a solution? So you put all the ingredients in the night before, set the thing to start the cooking process at a set time. I know I can also leave the pot in the fridge with all the ingredients in and then turn it on in the morning, but then I\u2019m guessing I can\u2019t sear meat?\n- Which leads me to: is searing the meat all that important? Again, some models allow this (either directly in the unit or take the pot out and do it on the hob).\n- If I turn on in the morning, and it doesn\u2019t have a self-timer-off function, I\u2019m guessing it will just continue cooking? How much of a big deal is this? If so, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s important to get a model which either turns off on a timer or switches to \u2018keep warm\u2019?\n\nThanks for your help :)",

            "comment": "You do not need a super expensive crock pot with super timers and all that. Crock pots are basically to keep food to cook food below about 200\u00b0.\n\nI use the Crock-Pot liners so I don't have to do huge cleanups. The night before I fill the liner with the vegetables and the broth. I use a twist tie to close it and put it in a bowl in the fridge. In the morning you put the bag into the crock pot and then you add the meat on top.  Make sure it's plugged in turn it on low and come back in 8 hours and dinner's done.\n\nAlmost all of the pulled pork recipes can be converted to crock pots.  Mix up the liquid the night before and leave it in the fridge. Prep the meat the night before which is to cut off some of the fat cap, because I use the cheapest pork I can find.  If the recipe calls for marinating overnight then do it otherwise just put it in the Crock-Pot first thing in the morning. I personally cook my pulled pork closer to 10 to 12 hours but that's because I wanted to just dissolve in my mouth.",

I then take the ceramic portion of the crockpot out with the food in it and put the whole thing in the fridge.  In the morning I put it in it\u2019s heating element and plug in. \n\nDisclaimer:  I\u2019m a newbie as well.",

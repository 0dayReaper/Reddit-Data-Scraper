But I can't afford roasts and my family won't eat soups/stews.\n\nThe best I can do is cheap ground beef (family doesn't like chicken) and I have *no* stove or oven.\n\nCan anyone suggest good casseroles to make in the slow cooker?  I'm an expert at getting rice and uncooked pasta done just right in the cooker so don't worry about that.  :)\n\nThank you so much for your help!",

I'm sure if you'll Google you'll come up with many variations of shepherd's pie. \n\nYou can also do something like an enchilada casserole with seasoned beef on the bottom with some rice and or beans, a layer of Jiffy cornbread mix with a can of diced chilies, topped with cheese. Again, searches will come up with many variations of this.\n\nYou could also make a meatloaf - mix the ground beef with an egg and bread crumbs, or bread soaked in milk, seasonings and maybe some finely diced onion and optionally add some shredded cheese, shape it to fit in the crock-pot, top it with a little beef gravy or ketchup. maybe you can fit some small new potatoes around the sides and serve it with a salad or coleslaw. Leftovers make good sandwiches, too.\n\nGood luck!",

Here stews and casseroles are very similar, basically meat and veg in a stock/gravy (I think traditionally the differences were that stews were cooked on the hob, casseroles in the oven). But from what I\u2019ve seen on various food subs is that in the US lots of one-pot dishes that are cooked in the oven are called casseroles. For example what we call tuna pasta bake is called tuna casserole, and at thanksgiving green bean casserole seemed popular. I might be totally wrong and just getting confused though lol.\n\nBtw that pork casserole recipe looks great. My mum used to make something similar, with the addition of apples, and it was one of my favourite winter comfort meals.",

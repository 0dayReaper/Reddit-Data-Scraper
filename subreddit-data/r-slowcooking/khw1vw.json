Didn\u2019t measure it, just kind winged it: First mixed up Mayo, a little sour cream, Dijon mustard, minced garlic and salt n pepper. Then once that tasted good, I added in the horseradish. \n\nI put the juice from the crockpot in a pan on the stove and reduced it a bit to make an au ju to dip. This is a crowd favorite (and a recipe I found on this sub years ago when I got my first crockpot!",

It has many different names.The terms submarine and sub are widespread and not assignable to any certain region, though many of the localized terms are clustered in the northeastern United States.  \n\n[About Me](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrn2mj/about_me/) - [Opt out](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrti43/opt_out_here/) - OP can reply !delete to delete - [Article of the day](https://np.reddit.com/comments/k9hx22)\n\n**This bot will soon be transitioning to an opt-in system.

    "postText": "I am not a cook.  \nI've started using the crockpot due to budget stuffs.  \nNormally what comes out of the crockpot is amazing but this last one flopped and tastes like rotten broccoli?  I ate 1/4 of a bowl and my stomach cramped up.  \nI'm using a small ceramic crockpot.  \nNothing was canned.  \n\n\nNormally I put some diced summer sausage with this and it's amazing.      \nIngredients:   \n2 cups of pinto beans  \n4 cloves of broccoli  \n3 carrots  \n1/4 onion  \n1/2 Jalapeno  \nCooked for 5 hours.  When I got to it the water at the top had evaporated exposing a little of the ingredients.  \n\n\nI'm not picky but after eating a 1/4 bowl my stomach cramped and I had to toss it.  How can I keep this from happening in the future.",

Both cruciferous vegetable and beans make for a lot of gas in the tummy. I would have a stomach ache for a day or so with this combination. One of the other would be better. \nWas this your recipe or did you get it from somewhere??",

I think you should try a different recipe next time, add the broccoli later, or prepare it separately (microwave, oven, plain boiled but not as long).",

You pay the same for beef if you cook it in a pot or on a grill. \n\nIf you\u2019re not a cook, how do you know what rotten broccoli tastes like? Was it frozen or fresh? How long and how did you store it? Did it smell? \n\nWhat liquid did you use and how much? And what do you mean by water on the top evaporated? You don\u2019t need to keep anything covered with liquid. \n\nHow did you cook the beans? Raw straight into the crockpot? Or soaked and then cooked? Or cooked beforehand? If so, how long ago and how was it stored?\n\nFood borne illness doesn\u2019t really ever manifest symptoms until at least twelve hours later, so if you got sick from something you ate, it certainly wasn\u2019t that. \n\nIn the future, maybe use a recipe you like, and start with that, make it consistently and then start to branch out. If you don\u2019t cook normally there are people with more experience that may know things you don\u2019t. After you get a little more confident about your skills, then make stuff up.",

    "postText": "I'm trying to figure out \"the best\" way to time my chicken breast recipes in the slowcooker. I get the packs from Costco which usually have 2 breasts each and use 2 packages. All four pieces usually can sit in a single layer and I thaw them completely. I'm seeing lots of \"plain pulled chicken\" recipes that say 2ish hours on LOW w/o any sauces but all the recipes that involve sauce have 3-4 hours on HIGH and low is much longer. Is there a good rule of thumb I can go by get a good baseline (obviously checking temp for proper food safety). That big of a difference in time is a make/break for dinner if I've gotten started late. Does the sauce really require that much additional time/heat?",

Just enough to be as thick as the rest. Then, they will all cook evenly together.\n\nShoutout to those times when you find half the weight of your bag of frozen chicken is one breast from a mutant gladiator chicken, that was held down by three men at slaughter.",

It took about 5.5 hours on high to be shreddable. But I was busy with other stuff so I ended up turning it to low around 6 hours and it was probably cooking an extra hour on low. With enough liquid, it doesn\u2019t dry out. \n\nMine will get hot enough to have a simmer/ bubbling around the edges, but not fully boiling. But everything was basically completely covered by the salsa (I added a little extra water with the salsa)",

If beans or vegetables etc are in there it will take a little longer and I\u2019ll check it every 10 minutes and rearrange things in the pot so the chicken cooks better. I don\u2019t want rubbery chicken or botulism either. U know when they are done when they can easily shred and aren\u2019t pink inside. When I shred the chicken I leave separate until the crockpot is cooled down to where when I put the chicken back in it won\u2019t cook further.",

    "postText": "Just wondering if I need to desalinated a corned beef that I will be cooking in a crockpot submerged in Guinness. Last year I made one which I soaked in water overnight to desalinate, it was tasteless! I cooked in Guinness in a crockpot. The second time, I didn\u2019t desalinate and did not use Guinness in the cooking process and it was TOO salty! If I don\u2019t desalinate and cook it in crockpot in Guinness, would this draw out some of the salt?",

    "postText": "When I was younger we ways had pulled pork at family picnics.  It wasn't barbecued.   From what I remember it had celery seed and perhaps apple cider or white vinegar. It was more of a plain recipe but it had such a distinctive taste and I want to make it for my kids however family members that made it have passed on and I can't find it anywhere.  Anyone out there know what I'm talking about or have the recipe? Thanks!",

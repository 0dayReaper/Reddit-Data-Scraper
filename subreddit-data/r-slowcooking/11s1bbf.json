I usually just 1 for 1 the poundage  of the beef per packet of taco seasoning (don\u2019t have the bulk container which I should buy) I skip the gravy mix for the Barbacoa and usually add some beef broth which arguably might be unnecessary but I feel like the liquid doesn\u2019t hurt. I usually do it for gatherings and it is by far the easiest dish to prepare and people lose their minds over it.",

It came out so mouthwatering and melty all by itself, shredded super easily, we made tacos and the only thing I put on my mine were some chopped Romaine lettuce and shredded cheddar, no extra hot sauce or other sauces just the meat drippings OMG DEFINITELY going to be a regular in our rotation!\n\nActual \"recipe\" for anyone who wants it:\n\n1 large or 2 small onions sliced into rings, 1 2.5-3.0 pound beef chuck roast, 1/4 cup brown gravy mix (1 packet), 1/4 cup taco seasoning (1 packet), 6 tablespoons of butter, 5-6 peperoncinis, a splash of the liquid from the jar of peperoncinis, 1/2 cup of water\n\nSpread the sliced onion over the pot of your slow cooker insert, place the roast on top, sprinkle the gravy mix and taco seasoning over the top, lay the peperoncinis and butter pats on top, mix the jar liquid with the water and pour into the cooker insert all around the roast but not over the meat. Put the lid on and cook for 8 hours on low.",

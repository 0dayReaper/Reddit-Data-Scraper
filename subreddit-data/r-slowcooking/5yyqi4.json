If you're the type of person who worries about today's slow cookers burning down your house, this device is probably your worst nightmare.  \nThat half-broken cord... D:\n\nTaken from this [blog](http://www.corningware411.com/2013/07/whats-old-is-new-is-old-again-but-also.html):\n\n&gt; The original Slow-Cooker or at least the basic idea, was introduced by Naxon Utilities Corporation in August of 1970 and dubbed the Beanery all-purpose cooker. Irving Naxon, the inventor, was evidently inspired by a story his grandmother told him about how *her* mother had made Cholent in the the oven back in Lithuania. Cholent is a slow-cooked bean-barley stew traditionally served on the Sabbath. The soup would be started on Friday evening, before sundown, and slowly cooked until midday the next day. Given the amount of time required to make it, Naxon set out to create an appliance that would \"do all the work.\"\n\n&gt; His answer was the Beanery, a self contained ceramic crock/heating element that ran at a low temperature and could simply be plugged in, the contents of the stew added and left to simmer slowly for hours until it was time to eat.\n\n&gt; The Rival Company bought out Naxon Utilities in late 1970 or early 1971 (the date  seems to be a little fuzzy) and were less than impressed with the Beanery, but it was given over to the test kitchen personnel to see what they could do with it. They came back with a plethora of recipes for this \"slow cooking\" device that were delicious with minimal effort. So, Rival repackaged the device in late 1971 and dubbed it the 'Crock-Pot'.... Needless to say, it was a hit. But they didn't stop there, in 1974 they made the crocks removable for easier cleaning.\n\nWikipedia articles on the [Slow cooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_cooker) and  [Cholent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholent). Here's wiktionary's definition of [Crock](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crock).",

Everyone has lots of electrical things in the house that are left running. People leave lights on in the house all the time. Incandescent bulbs that are very hot. I know personally of a fire where a pet knocked a lamp over into a sofa or chair and it started a fire.\n",

Take a cleaned fish (e.g., trout), completely coat it with clay, and set it in the fire/on the coals. Gets hot, clay hardens, trout cooks in its own juices...crack it open and the trout just slips out onto your plate, usually without its skin (which gets stuck to the clay when firing). Other than the odd bits of crunchy dirt in your trout it always sounded like an appealing and simple way to cook a fish.\n\n...though not simpler than sticking a stick in it and holding it over a fire. To each his own I guess.",

I assume he's comparing old appliances where the circuit board was hand assembled through-hole as oppose to modern SMT stuff. Either way you can't buy prototypes, usually once the design has been laid out they ship it to china and convert it into something a machine can put together with subsequent board versions either simplifying or correcting a flaw. Usually the real determinate to whether a appliance will last is how much you're willing to pay. They just can't build a $50 mixer that will last a long as a Kitchenaid stand mixer from the '80s that cost $200 brand new, but then you don't see any cheap mixers from the same era either.",

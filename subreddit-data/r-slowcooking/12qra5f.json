            "comment": "Slow-cooking is a culinary technique that I find incredibly satisfying as it turns an inexpensive cut of meat into a delicious and tender dish. For this recipe, I chose to use beef shin, although any beef cut with a high connective tissue content would work just as well. The flavourful beef was combined with saut\u00e9ed peppers, onions and chipotle paste then placed inside a tortilla with Mexican cheese, before being pan-fried to perfection.\n\nTo elevate the flavours, you can add some of your favourite toppings such as guacamole, salsa, sour cream, jalapenos, salad, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice.\n\n**Ingredients for Beef Quesadilla:**\n\n\\* 400g (14.1oz) of the diced beef shin (or other cuts high in connective tissue)\n\n\\* 150g (5.3oz) Oaxaca cheese or substitute with mozzarella\n\n\\* 200g (7oz) sweet bell peppers, seeds removed and sliced\n\n\\* 1 medium onion roughly chopped\n\n\\* 2 garlic cloves minced\\* 1tsp mild chilli powder\n\n\\* 1tsp ground cumin\n\n\\* 1tsp cumin seeds\n\n\\* 1tsp dried or fresh oregano\n\n\\* 2tsp paprika\n\n\\* 1tbsp of chipotle paste\n\n\\* 500ml (0.52quarts) of beef or vegetable stock\n\n\\* 1tbsp tomato paste\n\n\\* 5g (0.17oz) chopped parsley\n\n\\* 1tsp of salt\n\n\\* 4 medium-size wraps (20cm (8inch) diameter)\n\n\\* vegetable oil\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to prepare Beef Quesadilla:**\n\n**1.** Marinate the beef in cumin, paprika, chili powder, marjoram, garlic, and 2 tablespoons of oil. You can marinate the beef the day before or at least 30 minutes before cooking.\n\n**2.** Fry the meat with onions on high heat to colour and transfer to the slow cooker (you can use a pot or leave it in the same pan as well) add stock to cover the meat and add one tsp of salt. Set the slow cooker on high setting for 3-4 hours (for overnight cooking, keep the beef in larger pieces and set on low setting)\n\n**3.** While the beef is cooking, fry the sweet peppers on medium heat for about 10 minutes, and set them aside for later.\n\n**4.** When the beef is tender, remove it from the slow cooker, and let it cool for a few minutes in the cooking juices. Then, remove it from the liquid, and shred it with your fingers. Mix the shredded beef with the fried sweet peppers, chopped parsley, tomato paste, chipotle paste and some of the meat cooking juices.\n\n**5.** Brush one side of the tortilla with olive oil and place it on a heated frying pan. Add cheese to one side and top with the shredded beef mixture. Once the tortilla is golden-brown, fold it over and flatten slightly.\n\n**6.** Remove the quesadilla from the pan and cut it in half before serving. Enjoy with your favourite Mexican toppings!

I couldn\u2019t really taste any of the beautiful ingredients that are in it\u2026..cumin, paprika, the garlic\u2026..the flavours were lost for some reason. Once I added the chipotle and parsley I could taste them, but the meat itself was a bit bland. Any ideas on how to improve this?? I cooked it for just over 4 hours and marinated it for about 90 minutes. Do I add salt to bring out the flavours? Maybe cook longer or shorter. Double the ingredients maybe?? Thanks for sharing this recipe and my wife gave it 8/10, so it\u2019s not all bad I guess!",

Try to double up on the spices and use more concentrated beef stock, I also recommend overnight slow cooking on low temperature, it will allow more penetration of the meat. What cut did you use? Bigger pieces may need piercing with fork before the process. Hope this helps!",

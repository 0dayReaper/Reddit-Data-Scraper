    "postText": "Not sure if this is allowed, apologies. I just discovered a hairline crack through the middle of my oval crock pot. Its visible on the inside and outside, it's on the bottom of the ceramic insert. We normally use crock pot liners. I have no idea when it got there, or how, though I did just transport it yesterday somewhere to be used for warming so it may have happened then. Is it still safe to use with the liners, or is there a risk of something catastrophic happening, or worse breakage? We can't go get a new one right at the moment. Obviously we wouldn't use it without liners, but just wondering thoughts around still heating it up with the crack.",

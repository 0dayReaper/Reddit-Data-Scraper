I did not add any liquids to the pot. \n\nPost-cooking, there\u2019s a lot of chicken drippings (I think?) and I would love to utilize them, if it\u2019s possible. \n\nWhat is your go-to method for using the liquid? \n\nThanks in advance!",

Start with some fat. a) You can use butter or b) refrigerate the chicken juice stuff and chicken fat will rise to the top and harden and you can use that. Melt your fat, and work in flour while cooking. Keep stirring and cooking the fat plus flour so it stays smooth. Then gradually work in your liquid. You can make gravy with stock, milk, water, cream, or the stuff that cooks out of a chicken, or any combination. This is Gravy 101 that any American child learns by watching people make it from the time watching child can stand up on a kitchen chair. Cups &amp; cups of liquid is what you want; you thicken it with flour to make cups &amp; cups of gravy.",

I normally run it off, chill &amp; separate it to fry chicken or cook roasties.\n\nIf it was cooked hot &amp; there's caramelised mass in the pan you can deglaze and add to a roux to make a small amount of gravy.\n\nIf you want to make a chicken stock, take all the leftover bones &amp; carcasses, roast them and long simmer with a rough mirepoix &amp; bouquet garni, then reduce before storing.",

If you don't need the chicken &amp; gravy now, freeze it for future reference. It is one of life's sure things.",

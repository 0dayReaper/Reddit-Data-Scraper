While instapots cook quickly, they need time to get the pressure up and to release that pressure - so a \"fast\" recipe is really a 30min or longer wait.\n\nIf someone wants to cook dry beans regularly or make a fast stock, instapots are the way to go. But if someone wants to have food waiting for them when they get home, an instapots is simply not capable of replacing a slow cooker.",

The result is that you have to increase the time on the instant pot (it's a non-pressure setting) for slow cooking recipes, and you risk having an over-cooked bottom layer by the time the entire dish is fully cooked. \n\nI think instant pots AND slow cookers are great tools, but they each have their strengths and weaknesses. I eat a *lot* of dried beans so I really want an instant pot to make cooking them faster - I just don't want to store another appliance lol.",

But to explain to you the basics, which isn't complicated... you don't put a huge, hot thing full of hot food in the fridge because it won't cool down quick enough (40f) to ensure the food is safe from bacterial growth. You transfer it into smaller containers before you put it in the fridge.",

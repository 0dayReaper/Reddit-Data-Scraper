Just peel and chop apples, dump in the slow cooker with a tablespoon or two of water, a squeeze of lemon, a sprinkle of brown sugar and cinnamon. Set on high for a few hours and when the apples have broken down, stir stir stir until you reach your desired level of chunkiness/smoothness. The taste depends mostly on what kind of apple you use, I prefer Granny Smith for the tartness.",

I did use almond milk this time because I had some but I prefer it with dairy milk or if feeling decadent half and half:\n\nI halved her recipe for Ebony,* my 3 quart slow cooker, you can scale up but you'll need a bigger slow cooker. Or if you only have a big 6 quart you'll need to double the measurements below.\n\n2 cups milk of choice, dairy or non dairy\n\n1/4 cup tapioca pearls, not quick cooking\n\n1/4 cup sugar\n\npinch of salt\n\n1tsp vanilla or other flavoring\n\nGrease the insert of your slow cooker.  Add first 3 ingredients. Cook on low for three or high for two hours. I cooked mine for two and half on low. Stir in vanilla extract. Mixture will be runny. Spoon into a bowl and refrigerate for eight hours and it will thicken up as it chills.",

If you used the canned kind roll out thin and slice after the juice is hot dunk the sliced biscuits into the fruit and top with enough canned biscuits to cover the top. Put the top on and cook till the biscuits are cooked.. How many biscuits?  For a large crock pot I buy 2 large cans of fruit and 2 things of biscuits. I put 1/2 to3/4 of the biscuits in as the rolled/sliced dunked into the hot juice and the rest on top. depending on the fruit you may choose to add a bit of spices like cinnamon to apples or to taste. If you use sour apples add a bit of sugar to taste if sweet apples you don\u2019t really need the sugar but I do add some apple juice to help cook the apples.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe only real rule is the fruit and juice needs to be hot/bubblingbefore adding the dough.   \nyou can use homemade Biscuit dough if you want to do the work and cleanup.\n\nsorry for the typos and such new device still training it to fix my sloppy typing.",

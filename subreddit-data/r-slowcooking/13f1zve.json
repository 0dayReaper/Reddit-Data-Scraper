    "postText": "So I've gotten lazy in my cooking, and supermarkets frozen stuff is good value. With meat going up in price so much due to inflation, this is my cheapest way of doing a filling beef stew.\n\n900gm of pre-diced beef (30oz)\n\n1.5kg of pre-diced root vegetables (50oz)\n\n300gm of chopped onion (10oz) (fried in skillet)\n\n200ml of a casserole sauce, (7fl oz)\n\n200ml of beef stock\n\nWhack it all in for 6-8 hours on medium until the beef pulls apart easily with a fork.\n\nSeason to your taste, I use salt, pepper, fresh basil, oregano and coriander in the last hour of cooking.\n\nIt costs $10 to make 5 decent portions. Eat with carbs of your preference. I had it with homemade chips/fries and garlic bread, but you could use any potato or bread to pair with it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oo2w315o1aza1.png?width=1347&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c5e8b966d8cb828930d79cf60d8a8774a35ffbfb",

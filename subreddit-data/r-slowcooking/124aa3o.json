Unique and potent but in no way overpowering, kind of like discovering a new flavor somewhere between the flavors you already know and love.",

Advice for next time, cut the stems off the pepperoncinis to save yourself the hassle of having to pick them out/eat around them in the finished product; and I personally find less butter is better. I usually do a quarter of a stick at most, and it's plenty.\n\nThe pickled red onions sound good too!",

    "postText": "As the title says I\u2019ve roasted a 3lbs chuck roast twice on \u201clow\u201d for 7ish hours. It\u2019s high quality meat, so I feel it must be my fault/or just the cut itself. I roast it in beef bone broth with veggies. Tastes great but it isn\u2019t as tender as I expected. Any other cuts of meet you\u2019d recommend? I want something that pulls apart. Thanks!\n\nEdit to add: wow thank you for all the helpful information! This group is the best. I\u2019m new to slow cooking and am excited to try with this new info. Thank you!",

In the morning, I'd put everything together in the crockpot and let it go all day on low until we got home. I'd start it about 7 am and it went until about 5 pm, sometimes 6. I'd always leave the liquid from the tom\natoes so so that it didn't get too dry or  thick. I turned the crockpot off and waited for between 15-3@0 minutes to get a bowl. My current hubs does chili on the stovetop, but I've always done it in the crockpot. Depending on the size, I use 2  cans of crushed tomatoes, 1 or 2 cans of diced tomatoes, 1 or 2 packets of chili seasoning, 2 cans of chili beans and a pound of ground beef.  It takes a bare minimum of 8 hours to get it to the right consistency, but the longer the better. Really 10 hours is ideal. It's thick but not too thick. It's really good at that point with sour cream, cheese and crackers.",

This has been specifically stated by Crock Pot brand. There are newer devices that have programming for multiple temperatures but these are the exception. A traditional cooker has an additional circuit of heater coils that are active only when on High and there is one thermostatic switch regulating temperature.\n\n\nFor your own device this is easy to test. Fill it halfway with water, turn it on Low for a few hours, check the temperature until it is stable. Unplug it, plug it back in, Turn it on High for an hour, check the temperature to see if it\u2019s the same or higher. Now you know YOUR device.",

I typically use just whatever cooking red wine and like the result.",

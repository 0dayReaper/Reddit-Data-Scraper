(It's been cooking on high for 3 hours now)",

This means it\u2019s still considered a risk for food poisoning. \n\nOP, please toss your food. At worst, you\u2019re looking at a very terrible case of botulism and would need to be hospitalized. At best, you\u2019d be fine, but do you want to take that risk?",

OP had previously opened the can, used half the contents, stuck the rest in the fridge, and is now using the remainder. The mold likely developed in the fridge and not as a result of poor canning.",

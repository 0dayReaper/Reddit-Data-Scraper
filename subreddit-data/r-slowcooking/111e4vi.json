Lower heat, deglaze pan with a spoon of tomato paste and a glass of wine. Season with salt and pepper. Pour over shanks and vegetables add enough stock to cover, and a bay leaf or 2 cook 3 - 4 hours, stir gently and top up on the hour if you're there. Prior to serving, skim any oils/fats that are floating, remove the shanks and thicken the gravy with potato starch. Stir in a handful of chopped fresh parsley.\n\nServe with something starchy like mashed potato or maybe shell pasta and the rest of the wine.",

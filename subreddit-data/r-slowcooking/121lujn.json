            "comment": "This was delicious. Highly, highly recommend. Here's the recipe:\n\n1 pork shoulder (Mine was too big at 7.5 pounds, so I ended up cutting half of it off and freezing it. I cut up some extra apple and onion and made a quick and easy freezer meal, which is a great bonus!)\n\n2 granny smith apples (cut into slices, no skins)\n\n2 onions cut into chunks/slices\n\n2 garlic cloves minced\n\n1 16 ounce jar of sauerkraut (I'm going to use more like 8 ounces next time) \n\n1/2 cup to 1 whole cup of BBQ sauce (I use Sweet Baby Rays. Sweet and Spicy Sweet Baby Rays adds a nice kick if you want it.)\n\n1 beef bouillon cube\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nYou could just throw everything in there, but this time I seared the meat in advance. I do also recommend caramelizing the onions lightly before you put them in. If you want more apple flavor, you could easily replace one of the onions with another apple. I also cut up the roast for the last hour, which isn't required. I think its worth it to add the sauerkraut, but can definitely be removed to add more onion/apple.\n\nCook the roast on high for 4-6 hours or low for 8-10 hours.\n\nI serve mine with cheesy grits, but I know that's not everyone's jam. Would also be great with potatoes and roast veggies/salad.\n\nEdit: People are asking about how long to cook the apples. Depends on the texture you want. If you want more of an \"apple sauce\" feel, cook them the full time. If you want individual chunks of apple that are still cooked, I wouldn't add the apple until halfway into the cooking process. Probably at least two hours before it's done.\n\nPeople have recommended subbing out pears, which sounds great. I'm not sure if they cook the same way the apples would.",

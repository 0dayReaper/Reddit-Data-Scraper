    "postText": "In the title. Thought I'd have a 6-quart Instant Pot at my disposal - came home to find it trashed (long story that I can't/don't need to get into here). So all I have is a 3.3-quart crock pot.\n\nI have 3 lbs of seasoned pork shoulder marinating in the fridge for pulled pork. Am I going to be able to cook this properly in the crock pot? Do I just need to adjust the cooking time, or am I totally screwed?\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, the lid on this crock pot doesn't have a hole in it for ventilation. The lid just sort of sits there, it doesn't lock into place or anything like that. Anyone foresee any problems with this? My last crock pot had a vented lid, so I never gave it much thought until now.",

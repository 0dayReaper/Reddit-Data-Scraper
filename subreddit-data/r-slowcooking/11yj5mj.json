    "postText": "So, every time I slow cook a boneless chuck roast, it comes out extremely tough and dry.  I usually slow cook for about 6 hours on low.  Any tips?  Is a slow cooker the wrong way to cook one of these?  Do I need to add more liquid?",

What all is going into the pot?\n\n6 hours on low is a little short when it comes to cook time. When in doubt, cook it for longer. That will always help it become more tender. I usually go for 8 hours with a beef roast.",

Are you sure you aren\u2019t cooking it on high?",

There should be enough fat in the joint that liquid is barely needed. It just needs more patience. I\u2019ve done it before, thought it was over cooked and dry, but it was just cooked through but the gelatinous tissue hadn\u2019t broken down yet. Seems counterintuitive but honestly, low and slow really does mean just that.",

With a fatty cut you also need to render the fat before you slow cook as it won't render otherwise.\n\nMeat \"falls apart\" when the collagen has broken down and there is nothing keeping the sinewy flesh held together. The problem is this process releases moisture. If you want juicy meat that falls apart, you need to get the timing right - too short and it'll be chewy, too long and it'll go dry.",

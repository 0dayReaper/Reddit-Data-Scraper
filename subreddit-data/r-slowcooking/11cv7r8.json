In my defense after an 8-9 hour crock cook I really don't relish the greasy clean-up of fatty pork butt which is probably, on it's own, fatty enough to close some veins off &amp; contribute to bodily harm. At 75 now, it's all tradeoffs but I do appreciate the warning.",

Since you don't know me except for the occasional slip I'm pretty green, growing a lot of my own chow, use organic this &amp; that, composting my scraps, recycling etc etc. So, I really hope your gen can force more of a change and enjoy in that you could. Best of luck with that....",

I cleaned it with water and soap, and then put it in the dishwasher (two times for the lid). The smell in the bowl itself is gone, but the lid smells like the old food. Is there any tips to get the smell out? Is it even safe to use?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the crockpot I have:\n\n[https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hamilton-Beach-Programmable-Stay-or-Go-Slow-Cooker-7-Quarts-Silver-33576N/287794326?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=0&amp;wl13=5866&amp;adid=22222222277287794326\\_117755028669\\_12420145346&amp;wmlspartner=wmtlabs&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=501107745824&amp;wl4=aud-1651068663746:pla-294505072980&amp;wl5=9026808&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wl10=8175035&amp;wl11=local&amp;wl12=287794326&amp;wl13=5866&amp;veh=sem\\_LIA&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwtsCgBhDEARIsAE7RYh1cC9O30zG7w9NsCAgoDS4MAlo4tc3Cb5VVBdOpJ5\\_NgdFck8EH59caAh3iEALw\\_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hamilton-Beach-Programmable-Stay-or-Go-Slow-Cooker-7-Quarts-Silver-33576N/287794326?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=0&amp;wl13=5866&amp;adid=22222222277287794326_117755028669_12420145346&amp;wmlspartner=wmtlabs&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=501107745824&amp;wl4=aud-1651068663746:pla-294505072980&amp;wl5=9026808&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wl10=8175035&amp;wl11=local&amp;wl12=287794326&amp;wl13=5866&amp;veh=sem_LIA&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwtsCgBhDEARIsAE7RYh1cC9O30zG7w9NsCAgoDS4MAlo4tc3Cb5VVBdOpJ5_NgdFck8EH59caAh3iEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds)",

Get all the crud off with a 3M scrubby sponge and rinse well. Then fill it up with hot hot water, add 2 tablespoons of bleach (or two-three glugs from the bottle). Let it sit for 20 minutes, then drain. Now put in the lid. Refill the sink with hot hot water and a bit of bleach again, then let it soak for a little while. Rinse. Repeat as needed.",

After that, use a scouring pad you don't care much for, and give both another scrub with dish soap and hot water. I also spray some antibacterial kitchen cleaner in there too and wash both again.

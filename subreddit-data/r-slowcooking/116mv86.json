It's my preferred method over roasting. \n\nYou sear it first in a garlic and herb butter *on both sides and then I think it's like an hour per pound or something on low (I like mine inner temp about 125F), and add a little beef stock (like 1/2\"-1\" inch worth) and maybe some veggies. *Also baste in some more butter when you put it in the crock pot. I usually use the browned butter from the sear and then a fresh coat. Fat cap goes up. Season to taste before the sear and a little more in the pot if you'd like. I use a rosemary salt herb blend mixed with the butter. \n\nCook to desired doneness then rest for 30 minutes.\n\nThey come out SO juicy. The leftovers become quesadillas or fajitas usually for me\n\n**Really surprised this got so much hate. You all should at least try it before you spew so much hate around. It's just one of few non traditional ways to do a rib roast.",

The goal of a good roast is a nice browned exterior crust, and well rendered fat in the interior. The slow cooker just doesn't do either well, all the fat gets rendered out, it makes for a very greasy stew, with leathery beef in it from overcooking\n\nSlow cookers just aren't the good way to cook a good cut of meat",

I agree with your point that an oven creates an exterior crust, but as far as the interior of the roast goes, I don't understand how heat from an oven and heat from a crockpot would have a different effect. I envision both methods would result in the same amount of grease rendered out of the roast if they were cooked at the same temperature and time. What am I missing?",

Go buy just a regular old standing rib roast and follow my technique above (also baste with herbal butter when going into crock pot, I left that part out, and put the fatty side up so the fat has gravity do it's thing) and let me know.",

It just goes to show that you really can use crock pots for just about anything.\n\nThat being said, I'd still prefer to roast, but this is absolutely a viable method.",

Searing and then cooking at a low temp until it reaches their desired doneness, what\u2019s the crime here exactly? \n\n\nIf it works it works.\n\nThe only thing I\u2019d say is that yes other methods may yield more desirable results due to the inter muscular fat rendering at certain temps, plus creating a drier surface for searing if done in that order, and I guess a slowcooker may yield uneven heating but what the person is doing is hardly different than some methods people use and deem \u201ccorrect\u201d.",

Which I generally make for game day sandwiches or for a fancier dish utilizing the larger chunks/slices to top a nice polenta or some dill mashed potatoes. \n\nAnd it does, just flake off and melt in your mouth. No extra hard fats or tendons to pick through after cooking before shredding, it all just melts off into what becomes the sauce. That being said, The crock pot is not a good option UNLESS you intend on shredding it after the fact. \n\nIf you want it solid I\u2019d go for a roast. \n\nJust incase anyone is curious as to my recipe for the shredded \u201csteak\u201d? I can tell you what I use, but I eyeball my ingredients so I don\u2019t have specific measurements. Here\u2019s what I do. \n\nWhile the crock pot is set to low and warming up: \n\n\nPour some straight up beef stock (about 1/4 inch to cover the bottom of the pot) into your crockpot.\n\nPlace your meat in.\n\n(This is where I start eyeballing)\n\nIn a super large bowl pour in 1/2 box liquid beef stock (not broth) \n\nAdd half a bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce. \n\nAdd a generous glug of steak sauce. \n\nAdd a generous glug of Worstershire or fish sauce. \n\nAdd a 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke. \n\nAdd a generous squeeze of spicy/Dijon mustard. \n\nAdd a glug of red wine vinegar or rice wine vinegar. \n\nAdd 1/2 onion minced. \n\nAdd 2-3 cloves garlic minced. \n\nAdd 1 whole bay leaf (to be removed before shredding the beef)\n\nAdd salt/pepper/ favorite spices that go well with red meat and bbq sauce. Again I eyeball this but I\u2019m pretty generous with the seasonings. I taste as I go to make sure things aren\u2019t getting too salty. \n\nWhisk your mixture like you want to murder it for stealing your horse. It should start to foam up a bit at the top. \n\nPour mixture over the top of the meat in the now warm crock pot, cover and ignore for up to the next 24 hours, but no less than 12 hours. When you\u2019re ready for it, remove the lid, take two forks and start pulling the meat in opposite directions. \n\nNote: based on a 12 hour cook time, it\u2019s ok to open the pot and flip the meat if the top is looking dry. Or you can even start slightly separating as it cooks. Just remember that everytime you remove the lid, you add about an hour to over all cooking time. \n\nI tend to remove the lid often for this particular dish to check for flavoring and viscosity of the sauce, hence why I mentioned 24 hours above. If you leave it completely alone it shouldn\u2019t take more than 12 hours. Depending on how much meat you\u2019re actually trying to cook.",

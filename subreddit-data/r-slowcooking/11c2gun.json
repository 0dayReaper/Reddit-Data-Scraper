Don't come for me.)** \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nWtf is it: Slow cooked chicken in enchilada sauce\n\nThe key Ingredients:\n\n2 lbs of skinless/boneless chicken breasts.\n\n2 10 oz cans of El Paso's Red Enchilada sauce. \n\n3 teaspoons of chili powder\n\n\nThe other ingredients:\n\n*I would use your best judgment on the amount of spices you use because I'm pretty sure my taste buds are immune to garlic powder and onion powder at this point, so I used a shit ton.*\n\nGarlic Powder\n\nOnion Powder \n\nCinnamon (a pinch)\n\nCoriander\n\nPaprika\n\nCumin\n\nSalt\n\nPepper\n\nGreen onion\n\nMexican 4 cheese blend\n\nSour cream\n\n\nThe steps:\n\nI lightly pan-fried the chicken with some olive oil and seasoned with salt and pepper.\n\nThen threw the chicken in the crockpot with the enchilada sauce and added the aforementioned spices.\n\nI also had 3 tomatoes that I needed to get rid of and blended them up in there, but I would honestly omit this next time as the consistency of the sauce was a bit too watery, even though the flavor was on point.\n\nI thickened the sauce up with an equal amount of cornstarch and cold water at the end of the cooking process to help out with the consistency.  \n\nAnyway, I cooked it all on low for 6 hours. Shredded the chicken in the sauce when it was done and then threw the sludge on a huge ass wrap. \n\nTopped it with some green onion, a Mexican 4 cheese blend, and sour cream.\n\nYou could go crazy and even bake the wraps, but alas, I am lazy af today.",

I don't like steak, seafood, or almost anything Asian. I'm even picky with chicken and turkey. I only like thinly cut pork chops and they have to be breaded and even then, doused in some kind of sauce. I mostly just eat sandwiches and frozen meals. When I do cook it's always the same few things. I had toast for lunch and cereal for dinner today, and that's a pretty regular thing. So to see a recipe like this, that isn't super involved and includes flavors I actually like, is awesome! I'm actually excited to have something new to try out. I've had two huge chicken breasts in the freezer for a couple of weeks, wondering what the heck to do with them besides popcorn chicken or strips (which is what I did with the other ones from that package). So this couldn't have come at a better time. Getting groceries delivered probably Monday so I've already added the required stuff to my cart. Thanks again!!",

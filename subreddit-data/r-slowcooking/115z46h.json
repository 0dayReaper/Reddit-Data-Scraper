    "postText": " I stuck to the original recipe. Here it is, plus some things imma do for next time. \n\n\n 2 cans of cream of mushroom (I use reduced sodium)\n\n 1 packet of beef and onion soup mix\n\n1 \"can\" of water\n\n1 - 1.5 pounds of cubed steaks\n\nSeason the steaks, my dumbass used salt and it was a bit too salty, next time imma use fresh garlic, hot sauce, or lemon, herbs, and Chilli powder. Marinate it, for up to 24 hours, then brown it In a pan with oil. Fry up some onions or peppers after the steaks are browned, then toss everything into the crockpot. Cream of mushroom, soup packet, and water with the steaks and all. Cook on low for 6 to 7 hours. Or on high 3 to 4. \n\n\nI served it with some cornbread (famous Dave's, recommend that brand, jiffy, or Zatarans. I also toss in some Cajun seasoning and top with hot honey) and served with some broccoli.",

            "comment": "Cubed steaks, also known as minute steaks, are cuts of sirloin or round that have been put through a machine that pokes holes into it, called a cuber. \n\nThey\u2019re done that way, and named minute steaks, because they take a minute to cook on each side. \n\nOne could argue, that not only are you wasting time and money slow cooking something that takes literal seconds to cook, but you\u2019re adding to the dishes by searing the steaks in a pan, when you could finish the entire meal in the same pan by simply deglazing and simmering for less than a minute to marry the flavors. \n\nHere\u2019s your recipe but adjusted.\n\nEntire cook time: 20 minutes.\n\nCube steaks, season with salt and pepper, dust in flour, or bread like chicken fried steak with egg and breadcrumb.\n\nSear in a hot pan until both sides are browned. The meat is probably fully cooked at the point you pull it, so no need for more cooking. \n\nDeglaze with any wine you like, add fresh sliced mushrooms, a spoonful of chicken base or some stock, or if lacking both, some water. If you still need mushroom soup base for flavor maybe cut down on the soda and cigarettes. That\u2019s what kills peoples tastebuds. Place the steaks back into the pan, Reduce the sauce, add a little chunk of butter. \n\nThat\u2019s it. From purchase to table it took you about fifteen minutes. Zero overnight marinade, didn\u2019t need to go between two cooking vessels, etc.\n\nSo we\u2019ve seared the steaks, made the sauce, now just add whatever roasted veggies you like, and that\u2019s a full dish. \n\nIf you absolutely want to cook a piece of meat in the slow cooker, stick to a leg or shoulder cut, brisket also works, but with minute steaks you might as well be slow cooking hamburger. At the end of the day you do what you want, but, maybe there\u2019s a better way eh?",

The difference is the sour cream.",

Usually, salt, msg, and hot oil do it fine and tender. But I do agree, arguably my recipe is a lot of work, but for someone who can be busy a lot, I just found this recipe for the crockpot simple, and really 10 minutes of prep \n\nThank you otherwise! Highly recommend white gravy! \u2153 cup of flour into about a \u2153 or a little less of the oil used to fry the steaks (keep warm In an oven, on a wire rack to keep crispy),  and cook on medium for about 2 minutes, then add 3 cups of milk and simmer until the right consistency (or honestly, you can boil it, just keep a steady eye and whisk pretty often). I season with a bunch of black pepper, salt, and minced garlic or garlic powder. Keep it simple. Serve with biscuits (love mine with Strawberry jam). \n\n\nYou are the nicest person to disagree with me here \ud83d\ude2d thanks again.",

GodDAMN!\n\nEdit: and of course some mashed taters, or like, maybe some corn. Hell yeah.",

Honestly like the texture better of biscuits, and cook them in a cast iron skillet, so when the cheese falls ok the cast iron, it gets so crispy! Nothing new, but a great one. \n\n\nI'd also recommend apple and fennel Cole slaw. Or \"pink coleslaw\".   \n\n\nPink coleslaw is purple cabbage shredded (about 8 to 10 ounces for this), a tablespoon or more of vinegar (just enough to toss it around), a tablespoon of homemade Strawberry Jam (the sweetness to flavor is way better), salt to taste, red chili flakes to taste, and if you want to throw in some celery leaves, or seeds!\n\n\nLet it marinate for like 15 to 30 minutes. The dressing becomes a bright ish Pink color, is fresh, and it's fun. Chicken fried steaks always remind me of the summer idk why \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

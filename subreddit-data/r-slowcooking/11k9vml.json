It\u2019s either hot in the slowcooker, boiling on the stove or in the freezer where it\u2019s kept. \n\nThe [\u2018danger zone\u2019](https://cpdonline.co.uk/knowledge-base/food-hygiene/food-temperature-danger-zone/) is between 60\u00b0C and 5\u00b0C, so long as it doesn\u2019t stay at that temp for longer than 2 hours it\u2019s okay to reuse again and again. \n\nI usually just strain everything and put back in the freezer within an hour of plating, it\u2019s not hot enough to disturb other things in the freezer by that point.",

Any bacteria formed in that small amount of time is killed by cooking again, especially with Birra as will have it on a rolling boil to reduce it down a bit before serving. \n\nThe amount of time it spends going through that window doesn\u2019t leave any bacteria long enough to produce any toxins also iirc, so the taste doesn\u2019t deteriorate either after reheating.",

I really love birria that's well done, but the recipe I tried from the Internet was nowhere near as good as the tacos I've had from the Hispanic family near me that sells them from their porch every Saturday.\n\nETA: They also sell birria ramen that is incredible. It looks like yours is a little more fancy; they just gave me a big cup of consomme and meat and an instant ramen cup to pour it into. It's still the best ramen I've ever had",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s overly authentic but it\u2019s tasty af. I usually just top up with more beef broth and onions in between cooks, and will add the paste every other cook. I use brisket too instead of short rib so it doesn\u2019t get overpowered with fat reusing the consomm\u00e9, works just as good.",

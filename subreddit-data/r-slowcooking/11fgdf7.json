Pop them in the fridge on a sheetpan with a baking rack to elevate them. I loosely cover them in parchment paper, just one sheet on top. Leave them for a few hours or ideally overnight. This dries out the skin. You can lightly spray them with oil and roast them at 450 until they are as crispy and cooked as you prefer or fry them on medium high for 5 minutes then turn the temperature down to medium and cook them through. Drain them and toss in whatever sauce you like. If you season them with spices, cut back on the salt because baking powder is salty.",

I wonder what it would be like to cook the wings in the crockpot inside of something like an easy teriyaki sauce toss that liquid, and then sauce them/finish them under the broiler, on the grill, or a pan?\n\nYou've def given me something to mull over! In general I think cooking them in a slow cooker sounds like a nice idea.",

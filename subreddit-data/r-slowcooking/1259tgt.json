Pour the sauce evenly over the tofu. Cook on low 7 to 9 hours.\nIf you want to make the sauce thick like the one at your favorite restaurant, mix the cornstarch with about 1 or 2 tablespoons of water to dissolve, then add to the slow cooker and mix well. Turn to high and cook 15 more minutes. The sauce will thicken.\nServe over your favorite cooked grain or in lettuce to make lettuce wraps.",

            "comment": "Notes: \n\nI'm flexitarian so I used honey and 1 tablespoon fish sauce as I'm sadly out of nutritional yeast. I also to get more ginger taste added a tsp of powdered ginger \n\nIf you are Vegan there is No Bee Honee for that honey flavor. \n\nCooking notes:\n\nI did not do night before prep and it took about 15 minutes to chuck it all in slow cooker before work. I diced my carrots instead of coining them as it seemed weird to wrap coins in lettuce. I used my 3 quart. It got two thirds full\n\nTasting notes: \n\nPretty darn good. I think I would add my chili garlic paste or recommend Sriracha for my Irish Midwest taste buds probably about 1 tsp,  for normal people probably add more. It was very mild. I'd also increase the soy sauce a little \n\nThis was good but did need some more spice and more soy sauce. If I had nutritional yeast or added mushrooms I think it would have been better, get that umami flavor. Definitely easy, I think it's better over rice or maybe wrapped in a tortilla with rice and Nori like a sushi burrito. Good slow cooker Vegan option though.",

If you do it the other way around, the denser solution just floats around in lumps.\n\nIn your situation, this means that you should add thin broth to the dense tomato paste and blend those together before you dump it in the stew if you want it to be easily incorporated. Something to think about for next time.\n\nFor now, get a whisk and see if you can at least beat the paste into smaller lumps. Eventually with cooking time they should blend in.",

The next step for me is always to add in the tomato paste and mix it with the now hot veggies\u2026 I then slowly add broth to incorporate. I think if you tossed the veggies in and the stirred the paste in with the veggies and then put in the rest of the ingredients into the slow cooker it would probably incorporate with minimal mid cook stirring.",

This will both cook out the tinny flavor from the can and also really deepen the flavor you\u2019ll get from the base of your stew.  It\u2019s a good way, if not the best way to begin building serious levels of flavor. I get that it\u2019s a slow cooker recipe but just doing this and browning your beef prior to tossing everything in the slow cooker will go a super long way and the resulting stew is gonna be exponentially better for it.",

    "postText": "My daughter\u2019s swim team is having a big meet in a couple of weeks, and traditionally the parents cook for it. My daughter requested her favorite- bean and cheese burritos. But, I have to keep them warm as this is going in a school hallway essentially (no actual kitchen) so I am trying to figure out how do I do this in a crock pot? Wrap them in foil and keep it on low? Don\u2019t I need to have liquid at the bottom? \n\nHas anyone had experience with this?",

If you have Chick Fil A cater an event, they pull those bad boys out of a cooler (and they're always warm - even in the 6th inning of minor league baseball game)\n\nAlso, bean &amp; cheese burritos awesome - your daughter has great taste :)",

Grab a burrito, spoon some hot beans from cooker, pinch some cheese on top, that sort of thing. Might be a bit messy but supervising it and serving up would be alright.",

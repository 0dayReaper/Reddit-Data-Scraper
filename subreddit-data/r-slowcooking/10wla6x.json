            "comment": "I made this for a work chili cook-off so fair warning a lot of it is stovetop but finished in the crock pot for easy transport and reheating.\n\n\nVery much inspired by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's recipe found here, but with my own spins:\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/real-texas-chili-con-carne\n\n\n2.5 lbs chuck\n\n1.5 lbs bottom round\n\n3 cups low sodium chicken stock\n\n4-5 dried ancho chilies\n\n3 Fresno chilies\n\n1/2 can chipotles in adobo\n\n1 red bell pepper\n\n1 onion\n\n2 tbsp garlic paste\n\n1 1/2 tbsp cumin\n\n1 1/2 tbsp oregano\n\n2 tsp smoked black pepper\n\n1 tsp cinnamon\n\n2 sections of unsweetened 100% cacao baker's chocolate bar\n\nA few glugs of Worcestershire sauce\n\nSalt to taste\n\n\nChop up and deseed the dried ancho chilies and bring water to a simmer, and rehydrate the chilies.  The water is used later, use 2-3 cups and reserve the water after.  \n\n\nWhile the chilies rehydrate, deseed and chop up the fresnos.  Add them, the rehydrated anchos, and the chipotles in adobo (with the adobo) into a blender alongside enough of the reserved chili water to cover to a blender and blend until smooth.  \n\n\nDice the onion and red bell pepper and set aside.\n\n\nSeason the beef with salt and sear the top and bottom on high heat using a neutral oil in a large pot, then once browned, remove and cube into 1-2 inch chunks.  Add the onion and bell pepper to the pot and cook until the onions have started to brown and caramelize.  Add the spices and chocolate to the pot and cook them a bit, then deglaze the pot with the chicken stock and Worcestershire sauce, I used the rest of the reserved chili water here as well.\n\n\nFinally, transfer the contents of the pot, the beef, and the chili paste to a slow cooker and mix well.  Cook on high for 4 hours, though check around the last hour to see if the beef is to your preferred tenderness.\n\nEdit: formatting",

But chicken stock is to my knowledge best for when you want various extra flavors to shine through but still want some meatiness/umami to the broth, as opposed to water or a pure vegetable stock.  Beer also would serve that purpose, but I have gluten intolerant coworkers and my local grocery store didn't have gluten free beer.",

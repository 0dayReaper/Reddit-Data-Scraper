If OP wanted they could have responded with a request for one with chicken instead of meat, or more of an African flavor and GPT would have created that.\n\nLet's dive deeper: Google searches the web and creates an index of it that can then be searched. If you look for \"good slow cooker recipe\", it will find all pages it knows that contain those words, sort it by what it thinks is the most useful and shows it to you. \n\nThere is more going on, but that is the gist of it. \n\nGPT is a completely different thing. Instead of creating an index of the internet, it's being fed text to train a neural network that is build to mimic a simple version of organic nerve cells.\n\nWith that it trains to complete text. At it's core it's good to figure out what comes after \"The sun is shinning and the weather is...\". \n\nExcept that it can do that with much more text and is being \"trained\" by everything OpenAI could get their hands on. (They are having the problem now that there isn't anymore text to train it, so they pivot to voice recognition. GPT4 is 8 years of web crawling, all reddit links with more than 3 upvotes, wikipedia... you get the idea)\n\nBecause of this it doesn't _really_ \"know\" things. It's supposed to do math or understand cooking recipes.\n\nBut since it's train on this vast amount of data it can output pretty much anything.\n\nOn top of that, there is a thing with these generative models that at a certain point they start having emergent properties. They do things, they were never trained to do. \n\nFor example, translating text or doing research level chemistry (besides the examples that went through the press, like passing the bar exam or FAANG assessments)\n\nThere are a few scary things about this, like it being impossible to explain how or why it generates this or that. \n\nIn practice, I have been using the newest version for a while now and it's really amazing.\n\n...I could go on",

The message is long from AI responses.)\n\nWell for starters, I don\u2019t have to sift through 100s of different websites all containing bullshit ads that require me to scroll past 50 paragraphs; giving me a backstory on how their recipe reminds them of their adolescent days with grandma. With AI I can enter the exact ingredients I have and it will instantly formulate me a recipe. I can ask it to generate a recipe for beef stew or I can ask AI to substitute another ingredient incase I\u2019m missing one. I ask AI what exact cooking utensils I\u2019ll need for a recipe - All instantaneously and none of the stupid bullshit.\n\nI can give you so many examples of how AI is 100x better than google and will eventually replace google, but I\u2019m not going to spend my Friday night doing that. \n\nHere you go, it\u2019s free - https://openai.com\n\nAsk AI to write a song for you, a poem, a cover letter for a resume, a formal letter to your boss asking for a raise, lines of code to build a website, etc. \n\nBetter yet - I\u2019ll use AI to answer questions from your posts \n\n\u201cDo I need to soak beans before using them in a slow cooker?\u201d\n\nAI - \u201cThere are different opinions on whether you need to soak beans before using them in a slow cooker. Some sources say that soaking beans removes some of the enzymes that cause intestinal discomfort, while others say that it is not necessary and that you can just rinse the beans and add them to the slow cooker with enough water and salt. However, red kidney beans are an exception and they should always be soaked first and then boiled for 20 minutes before preparing in the slow cooker. This is because they contain a toxin called phytohaemagglutinin that can cause nausea and vomiting if not destroyed by high heat.\nThe cooking time for beans in the slow cooker depends on the size and type of the beans, but it is usually between three and six hours on low setting. You can also add aromatics like onion, garlic, or bay leaves to flavor the beans. Once the beans are cooked, you can use them in your favorite recipes or store them in the refrigerator or freezer for later use.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow to improve my seasoning with a cast iron?\u201d\n\nAI - \u201cSeasoning is a process of creating a nonstick and protective layer on the surface of cast iron by heating oil or fat until it bonds to the metal12. Seasoning also prevents rusting and corrosion by keeping moisture away from the iron1. Seasoning can be done in the oven or on the stovetop, but the oven method is more even and reliable3.\nTo season a cast iron skillet in the oven, you need to follow these steps43:\nPreheat your oven to 200\u00b0F and then gradually increase it to 450\u00b0F.\nClean your skillet with mild soapy water and a stiff brush. Dry it completely over low heat.\nRub a thin layer of neutral oil (such as canola, vegetable, or grapeseed oil) all over the skillet, including the bottom and handle. Wipe off any excess oil with a paper towel.\nPlace the skillet upside down on the middle rack of the oven. Put a sheet of foil on the lower rack to catch any drips.\nBake the skillet for one hour, then turn off the oven and let it cool inside.\nRepeat this process until you achieve a smooth and glossy finish.\nIf your skillet is already seasoned, you don\u2019t need to do this every time. Just cook with it regularly and clean it properly after each use. However, if you notice any dry or patchy spots, you can re-season it occasionally to maintain its performance1.\nReceived message.

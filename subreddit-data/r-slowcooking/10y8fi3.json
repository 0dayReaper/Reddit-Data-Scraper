    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI'm considering doing a few racks of baby back ribs as well as a few pounds of short ribs for the super bowl.\n\nInstead of doing them the traditional way, I'm considering doing them in the slow cooker.\n\nA few questions. I'm thinking about just seasoning everything up, putting everything in together with some BBQ sauce. Probably on high for between 3-4 hours.\n\nThen taking everything out and broiling it with some fresh BBQ sauce.\n\nWill this work and be an acceptable end product? And if so can I do it Saturday and reheat it on Sunday for the game?\n\nI've never done these things together like this especially the day before. In fact I've never made short ribs in the slow cooker before. I've only braised them traditionally which is my favorite meal. I've never done them with BBQ sauce.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Thanks a million in advance.",

Use lots don\u2019t be shy with it. \n\nOnce it\u2019s all rubbed in wrap well in plastic and put in fridge to marinate overnight. \n\nWhen it\u2019s time to cook it just pour in about 1 or 1 1/2 cups beef broth, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 1/2 to 1 whole onion chopped or diced, stir it up a bit in the cooker. \n\nInsert ribs, coat with liquid and cook on low for about 6-8 hours.\n\nGently remove or it will fall out right off the bone.\n\nPlace on lined baking pan and brush with leftover juices, then brush with bbq sauce. \n\nBake at 275 for another 30 minutes if that\u2019s an option but you can skip this step if you want. I just think it helps to give the meat a good finish. \n\nBrush with more bbq sauce and broil for like 5 minutes or until the sauce has finished bubbling and caramelized. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP.\n\nBrush with more sauce and serve. \n\n\nAlso I\u2019m thinking of trying liquid smoke to the recipe. I think that will give it an extra kick.",

Then you can just toss that in the oven and when it\u2019s fully heated you can apply the sauce and broil it.",

Then I put the two racks in the slow cooker standing up right. So bones pointing up. Low for 8 hours. Take them out and put more bbq sauce on them then I'm the oven at broil for 1-3 min, don't skip this step. They were great. Slightly too fall off the bone but not bad. So tomorrow I'm going to take a peek at about the 7 hr mark.",

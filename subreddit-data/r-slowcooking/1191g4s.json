                            "comment": "Flour is good when you can saut\u00e9 it a bit to cook out the \"raw\" flavor.  When I use flour, I sprinkle it over the sauteed onions or meat and cook it for around 5 minutes while stirring frequently over lower temperatures (to avoid burning the flour), before adding the liquid.  If I have already added liquid and I need to thicken a stew, I use cornstarch: make a slurry with cornstarch and a small amount of cold water in a mug or something, then stir that into the stew and simmer for at least a minute.  The cornstarch will continue to thicken as the stew cools, so when using cornstarch and expecting leftovers, I generally aim for a slightly thinner consistency than what I want the final result to be.  Otherwise, the liquid in the leftover stew can be an off-putting texture: gelatinous like canned cranberry sauce or something. \n\nI'd probably pass on thickening this batch of stew unless you plan to finish it in one sitting, since reheating to properly activate the thickening process and can overcook the ingredients.  Plus cooling it back down again increases the risk of bacterial growth.",

Gelatin doesn't have the grainy texture that you'll find in stews made with a lot of flour, and it reheats better than cornstarch.

    "postText": "I bought a pork loin roast and already had bone broth, carrots, canned corn, potatoes, can of tomatoes. First do all of those things sound like they go together? I\u2019m sure about everything except the tomatoes. \nSecond here\u2019s my process: sear the outsides then put the meat in the slow cooker with broth then how long should I wait to put the potatoes and veggies in?\nThais is the first time I\u2019ve used my slow cooker in a long while so I\u2019m rusty and not very confident. \nI think I made a roast years ago and I messed it up(came out dry) and I don\u2019t want a repeat of that. Just any tips for proceeding would be nice.",

Anything canned add at the very end, because canned food is already cooked and just needs to be warmed, if you add canned food at first it will just disintegrate from overcooking. Potatoes and carrots go in with the meat because they are root veggies- tough and need a long time to cook to get soft. Throw in an onion and/or garlic too for flavor, and i would suggest- rather than canned corn, buy a few cobs from the grocery and cut off the kernels manually, then throw them in at the end, that way the corn is fresh and more nutritious, but this is just a suggestion not mandatory",

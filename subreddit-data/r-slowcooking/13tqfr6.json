    "postText": "I don't have a lot of experience cooking with chicken due to a family member's allergy. But I bought one of those rotisserie chickens to make into soup for the non-allergic part of the family. (The allergy is not severe enough that it can't be in the house, they just can't eat it )\n\nDo I put the chicken in at the beginning of an 8 hour slow cook like I do with my raw beef roast? Or should I start the vegetables first and put the chicken in later?\n\nEdit: Looks like the consensus is to add at the end, thank you everyone!",

            "comment": "Why are you slow cooking the soup if it\u2019s not raw chicken in it? Just asking because it\u2019s not really necessary if you aren\u2019t cooking the chicken. (I realize now I\u2019m reading a slow cooker sub, but still just curious). You can cook the veggies for just a few minutes and have soup pretty fast if the chicken is cooked already. \n\nTake all the meat off the chicken and then throw the carcass in the pot to make delicious broth instead of using store bought if you\u2019re going to use the slow cooker.",

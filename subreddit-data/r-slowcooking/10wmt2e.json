            "comment": "Think of it this way... cook it on slow, and the first few hours the connective tissue is getting tighter and tighter, and just squeezing out the fluid in the meat... dry and tough, yeah? All of the heat is simply tightening the connective tissue while the internal temp is slowly rising. It will take 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 hours (depending on size of the roast and your slow cooker) for the roast to get to a temperature that those connective tissues start breaking down. Once they break down they will dissolve into the roast, and it will be juicy again. If you keep going, those juices will cook out of the meat and you will end up with tender but dry roast. The trick is to cook it past the point of the connective tissue breaking down but not so long that you cook it dry again. It just takes trial and error. In my experience if it is VERY easy to shred with a fork, you cooked it too dry. Not a bad thing if you are going for shredded roast, but if you want nice juicy slices, you have to get it out before it reaches that point.\n\nEdit: if you want fork-tender, just keep cooking it until you can insert a fork, twist it, and feel little to no resistance... this is assuming something like a chuck roast that has a lot of connective tissue",

As the meat heats up, all the water goes out of it and it gets dry. In BBQ this is the stall.  Keep cooking it and the connective tissues breaks down, releases the meat fibers and lubricating everything making it moist again.",

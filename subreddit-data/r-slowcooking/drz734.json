To this day, if I put a lot of effort into cooking something a little more difficult than basically just heating things up, that first bite feels like it fills my soul.\n\nI'd recommend learning how to cook to anyone dealing with mental health issues. A home cooked meal is great for your mental, physical, and financial health.",

And it always helps to come home to a nice smelling home and good food.\n\nLet me give you some recipes to help you feel like the best damn cook in the world.\n\nMy favorite chicken for tacos and burritos:\n3 chicken breast\n1 jar salsa verde\nGarlic to taste\n1/2 diced onion\nToss that all in the crock pot on low before going to work. Come home, shred chicken amd enjoy. \n\nPot roast\n1 chuck roast\n1 bay leaf\n1 can beef broth\n1/4 cup red wine\n1 onion quartered\nGarlic to taste\n3 gold potatoes cubed\n3 carrots cut into large chunks (about 4 chunks per carrot)\n\nToss everything but the potato and carrot in on low before going to work with salt and pepper. Toss veggies in for 2 hours when home. Optionally cook equal parts butter and flour in a pan then add drippings from crock pot to make gravy. Serve with remaining red wine.\n\nDelicious lamb that's great for entertaining or a fancy winter meal. This one is spendy but honey I promise you're worth it.\n\n1 leg of lamb cut into 1 inch cubes\n3 gold potatoes cut into 1 in cubes\n4 tomatoes peeled and cut into 8ths\n1 red onion sliced\n1 wedge picarino romano finely grated (parmesian will also work in a pinch)\n1/2 tablespoon rosemary chopped\n1 tablespoon chopped basil\n1/2 tablespoon oregano\nGarlic to taste\nSalt and pepper\n1 pinch chilli flake\nSplash of olive oil\n\nTo peel tomatos blanch them. Boil a pot of water and put tomatos in for 5 seconds each. Immediately place them in ice bath. A knife should pierce the skin and they'll peel easily now.\n\nToss all ingredient together until everything is nicely coated. Put in crockpot on low for 6 hours. Serve with crusty bread.",

For me one of my favorite routines is grinding the beans for my coffee every night, and setting it up so that it\u2019s ready to go in the morning. I love waking up to the smell of fresh coffee in the morning, so it feels like I\u2019m doing something nice for my future self. It may sound silly, but it\u2019s really helped me.

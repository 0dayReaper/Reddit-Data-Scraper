    "postText": "I did 1.5kg of Karkowka which is the Polish cut I would call probably pork chuck steak. Fairly basic spice rub overnight, then onions underneath.\n\nLow for about 6 hrs then shredded and used my normal piedmont style sauce to finish and kept it warm in the cooker for maybe an hr. I was impressed with the amount of liquid still in the meat when shredding it. Looks like it came all the way up to high 70's C during the cook though.\n\nTo me it was kind of dry compared to when I used to do it over charcoal in a Big Green Egg.\n\nShould I just cook it a bit shorter or is there something else I am missing?\n\nI'm new to the slow cooker but have lots of slow cooking experience in the oven or smoker. To be honest the oven was an easier transition. The amount of liquid from the onions really seemed to be my downfall here I think at the moment. The juice was great and I used it in the sauce instead of water but the meat just didn't have the fatty juiciness I love about slow cooked pork.\n\n\\[Sorry if this is a bit rambly and over the place but I am still trying to work out what happened\\]",

            "comment": "Maybe your cut of meat was too lean!  I use shoulder. I put rub on the day before and then the day I am going roast in oven, I pour a jar or can of unsweetened applesauce over the whole thing, add 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup ACV and 1/2 cup Apple or Tart Cherry juice to the pan. Cover the whole roaster with aluminum foil and roast 5 hours, 300 degree Fahrenheit. Shred the meat and incorporate the applesauce into the shred with a little ACV and juices in the pan. I\u2019ve done it this way for 20+ years.",

            "comment": "I buy the absolute cheapest fattiest pork roast I can find. Pulled pork is about overcooking it until it's at the the pinnacle of tenderness.  I use a Carolina sauce. It's primarily equal parts apple cider vinegar and apple juice. You can add hot sauce or red pepper flakes.\n\nI cook it on low, in the crock pot for at least 8 hours.  At 8 hours I tried to call a strip of meat off from the roast if it comes off in a nice strip then I turn it off and let it sit there and cool down for at least a half hour.  If you don't have the nice trip off then put the top back on and let it continuous slow cooking. Check it every half hour afterwards.",

                    "comment": "Although I'm 100% in favor of customizing recipes to our liking, no variant of traditional NC or SC BBQ sauces contain apple juice. That said, if adding apple juice works for you, rock on. Traditionally, depending on which region, the sweet elements in NC sauce are brown sugar and ketchup (Western NC).\n\nThis is pretty accurate, although I was taught to also add cayenne pepper along with the red pepper flakes.\n\nhttps://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/regional-barbecue-sauce/",

            "comment": "I'm from North Carolina and typically whole bone in pork shoulders are used(or boston butt as commonly referred to). They range in the 8-10 pound range and have plenty of fat to keep it moist. I don't know if you can get this in Poland but this usually yields a much better cook than a pork roast. Low and slow @250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 8-10 hours will do the trick.",

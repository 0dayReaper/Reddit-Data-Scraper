So I got them at the market and used a ladle to add the pot roast juice to a pot and steamed them for about 15 minutes. Then I removed the steam basket and dropped them into the juice to soak up the flavor. I poured them and the juice back over the roast after that. \n\nBut if you add them to the crockpot an hour before the roast is done you\u2019re good to go!\n\nBonus: The bread is a Mexican bolillos. Cut in half and generously butter it. Place in oven directly on the rack you can use foil to catch melting butter if necessary. Bake at 450\u00b0 F for 7 minutes.",

When it's the proper consistency I take it out. The thing with pulled meat is that you're deliberately overcooking them in liquid (cooking term is braise) to get them to be the absolute tenderest you can.  \n\nThe reason for the range is simply because not all Crock-Pot are created equal. Depending on machine high and low temperature varies. My 6-quart crock pot is much hotter on low then my 2-quart Crock-Pot is.",

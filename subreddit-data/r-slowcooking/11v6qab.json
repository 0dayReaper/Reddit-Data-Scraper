Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin, cinnamon, thyme, smoked paprika, chilli powder, allspice, bay leaf, cloves and marjoram (Quantities were Freestyle). Then add a dried ancho chilli, 2 chipotle chilli, 5 habanero chillies and 125 grams of butter. Fill everything up with about 200-250ml beef broth. Cook on low for 8 hours. At the end of the cooking time, remove the meat and chop it up. Mix the cillis, onions and peppers in the blender and mix partly with the meat.",

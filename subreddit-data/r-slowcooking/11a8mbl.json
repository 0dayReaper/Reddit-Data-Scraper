    "postText": "Hey everyone! \n\nThis is the fourth time using my slow cooker (8 Qt programmabls Crock Pot brand), and I decided to put my trust in the Internet and give the Mississippi Pot roast a go. \n\nI seared the roast on all sides in a frying pan first. \n\nI put my roast on high for 2 hours, and now it's on low for the remaining 6 hours.\n\nDo y'all think this will be an adequate amount of time to get tender results? \n\nI lined the bottom of the crock with saut\u00e9ed onions and saut\u00e9ed minced garlic and placed the chuck on top (with all the other ingredients, etc etc) . \n\nI'm planning on roasting some red potatoes in my oven about an hour prior and wanted the timing to line up. \n\nI've always been a little paranoid when I cook something for the first time and just really wanted this to go well.\n\nAny advice/tips would be greatly appreciated! :)",

I swear people write these recipes for a grandma that thinks ketchup is \"too spicy\" so they always under-season and go light on the flavorful ingredients. 4 pepperoncinis for a 4 pound roast?! You're smoking crack if you think that creates flavor . . .",

This is just Chuck Roast and nothing else. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nI thought I was going overboard with 10 peppers and 1/2 cup of pepper juice, but like dang.. nothing!\n\nI am willing to use the rest of the jar at this point, but I wouldn't know how to add it to the already cooked chuck roast. Do you think I could get away with Pan frying the peppers + juice and pouring it over the roast?\n\nI guess I could also add another packet of Aus Jus + Ranch mix whilst pan frying?  I honestly don't know. \n\nOr should this just be a next time thing..? Lol. \n\nI'll have to try mixing the seasoning with the juice as well, ughhh. It just sucks because I was just so underwhelmed. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

Edit: Maybe not this because I don't want to overcook it. But definitely fiddle around with the cooking times. Maybe 6 hours low, 2 hours high at the end. \n\nI'm not giving up quite yet!",

    "postText": "As the title says, I'd love a slow cooker recipe for chicken noodle soup to make the day after having baked chicken. One that tastes VERY similar to a certain brand name's version of it. My version has too little or too much all the time, so if you have a recipe or a link to a favorite of your families I would absolutely love you all to bits! \n\nTIA :)",

If you want it more like condensed soup, use spaghetti noodles broken into quarters instead of the egg noodles. \n- leftover chicken (I never measure, just use what I have, but I\u2019d guess around 2 cups or so) \n- 2 Tbs Better than Bouillon with 8 cups water (or 8 cups chicken broth) \n- 1/2 lb carrots, peeled and chopped \n- 4 celery ribs, chopped \n- salt and pepper to taste \n- 1 tbs dried parsley \n- 1/2 lb medium egg noodles, cooked separately to al dente (you technically could cook them in the crockpot with the soup, but I personally don\u2019t like the starchiness that adds. If you want to, just add another 3-4 cups of water and tbs bouillon or broth) \n\nSlow cook 6-8 hours on low or 4 hours on high. Stir in noodles and let warm 30 minutes. \n\nThis is a very basic chicken noodle soup but is more similar to store brands in flavor. Also delicious with bay leaves, onion, and dill.",

            "comment": "Master the art of making broth.\n\nSeriously. Soup is easy (super easy) if you have a really good broth.\n\nSo.. roast your veggies (I'm talking 450 for 60 minutes) the recipes call for 30.. I find that to get that deeper flavor, longer seems better); two trays in the oven, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, tossed in salt and olive oil. If you add beef bones or chicken go at it. \n\nYou may want to reduce the temp / time for chicken.\n\nThen toss it in the pot, with water, salt, pepper, bay leaves, (sage if you have some fresh), italian seasoning (at the minimum). Cook for +1 hour (I generally use an instant pot).\n\nLet stand/cool for a bit, strain out the veggies, and squeeze out every bit of juice you can.\n\nRemove the bones -- this is a nice snack if you want the marrow (if you used beef or pork) etc is delicious.\n\nNow, you have options for the chicken noodle soup.\n\nOnion, garlic, salt.. stock.\n\nYou can do a pulled chicken before you toss in the stock etc. Or you can sear it on a high-heat frying pan then cube it to give it texture.\n\nAdd carrots, celery, bay leaves .. to taste. Peas work too.\n\nFor noodles, you can do a few things, fresh noodles, sourdough dumplings, or dry noodles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't use recipes for any of this (except for the dumplings / noodles).",

            "comment": "This is not what you asked for as I don't think it would work well in the slow cooker, but I'm going to toss it out here anyway. It's more for when you are in a heck of a hurry, but it honestly tastes like you cooked it all day and you can toss in any leftovers you may have in the fridge. You could feed unexpected guests on a cold winter evening and very quickly.   The base starts with a package of \"Bird's-Eye Chicken Voila\" This is in the freezer section and meant to be a skillet meal. Add to a pot with some chicken broth or stock  or bouillon and heat...From there, add what you feel like.  Your leftover chicken, an onion, left over corn, green beans, whatever! The more you add the better it is, but honestly, it will stand with just the Voila and broth.   Season to taste. It doesn't come with a lot of chicken, so adding your leftovers would be perfect.  I hope you don't mind me dropping this here. New to Reddit and working my way around. The only reason I wouldn't do it in the slow cooker, or you could I suppose, It wouldn't take very long, is that the noodles get really large if you pack up any leftover for the next day. Still edible, but noodles are a bit mushy.  Serve with some jiffy cornbread or just bread and butter. It's warming, filling and super fast!",

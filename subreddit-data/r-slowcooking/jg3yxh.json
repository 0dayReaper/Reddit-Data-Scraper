Likely the actual crock has been cracked and leaching lead into everything they cook in it for easily the last 20 years. And I mean, just look at the state of the exterior cooker.",

If you added the dairy ingredients before the soup was finished cooking, the high heat from the crock will cause the proteins in the cream to literally curdle, which adds more lactic acid to the food and it will most definitely change the flavor. Next time around, I suggest adding any dairy or heavy cream after the soup is finished cooking.\ud83d\udc4c definite game changer!",

Both use the ounce as a smaller part of the whole but they are not interchangeable (unless it's water).  A cup (volume) consists of 8 fluid ounces.  \nThe only way your conversion works is if the thing you're measuring is exactly one fluid ounce of volume per ounce of weight.  Water fits this bill because that's where the standard comes from.\n\nThink of it this way.  If I take two cup measures and in one I fill it with rice, and in the other I fill it with lead fishing weights, which one is going to feel heavier?  They are both 8 fluid ounces of volume, but  the cup of lead will weigh just over 29 ounces (one pound 13 ounces) and the cup of rice will weigh just under 7 ounces.",

Tortellini soup is a broth dominated dish, like ramen or pho. From what I can see needs more spinach. The sausage would have been nice browned. The tortellini looks overcooked but obviously I can't taste test it. \n\nI do like the carrots. I often make tortellini soup with mirepoix. Broth and aromatics first then spinach, tortellini, and browned protein just for the last couple of hours. YMMV. \n\nThanks for sharing.",

I went to pull the chicken and it still had an internal temp of 100f. I didn't know how long it'd been like that so I had to throw it out as to not poison my wife and myself. I have enough to make another batch but not a slow cooker anymore :(",

Add the beef, about half of the spice mix, and more salt to taste. Cook through. Remove the beef to the slow-cooker crock, but leave behind the drippings.\n\nCook the onions and garlic in the drippings until softened and fragrant. Put those in the crock too.\n\nAdd tomato sauce, white vinegar, molasses, beans, and the rest of the spice mix. Mix together, put the lid on, and set the slow-cooker to low for 6 hours.\n\nIn the last hour, add the frozen corn. In the last several minutes, add the masa harina.\n\nNOTES: This recipe is flexible by nature, so you can add whatever you want, really. I often add chopped bell peppers and/or jalapenos in the onion/garlic step, for example. Any bean could be used, any ground meat, whatever type of onion you have on hand, etc. Enjoy!",

I call it my \"2 By Chilli\" bc it's easy to shop for. \n\n2 lbs ground beef\n\n2 onions, 1 sliced in thin ribbons, 1 chunky\n\n2 pepper, green or red, same slice as the onions\n\n2 cans chilli beans, 1 black, 1 hot. Drained\n\n2 packets of Chilli Man seasonin\n\n2 hefty scoops of smooth peanut butter\n\nHalf cup coffee, cold and leftover from the morning is fine\n\n2 small cans tomato paste\n\nHalf cup any beer you've got laying around\n\nTo spice it up just add habanero or jalapenos or others to taste. \n\n4 hours high, 6-8 low is fine. Ill usually add about 2 tablespoons of smoked paprika at least an hour before serving. It's nothing special. I'd like to go a lot more heat but my wife doesn't and this is great. \n\nSteps are generally. Brown all the beef with the seasonings in in a big pan. Dump that into the crock pot. Same pan, don't rinse it, peppers and onions, feel free to toss it in garlic also. Once they soften up just a bit stop and let the bottom layer burn just a bit. Blackness on some spots. Toss that all into the crock pot. Both drained cans of beans on top at this point. Stir it all up and give it an hour or two, barely matters, then add the tomato paste, coffee, and beer. Another good stir. Let that get back up to temp and nice and hot. Scoop up the peanut butter and stir it in. Then do it again. I think that's about it. No complaints. You can spice up yours as you see fit. \n\nEnjoy.",

Optional bell pepper.  Stock cubes.\n\nA small blender is needed. \n\nSpice mix.  Dried Ancho (1) and Chipotle chillies (1-2), and de arbol (2-3) (or chilli flakes are fine in a pinch).  Cumin and oregano, paprika.  Cinnamon, coffee and a small amount of dark chocolate. \n\n1.  Take the dried chillies and cut into small pieces, discard the seeds.  Soak in a small amount of boiling water. \n\n2. Chop onion finely, slice garlic, open tins and drain and rinse beans. Switch on slow cooker if possible. \n\n3. Fry off the beef mince in batches.  I need to do 4 batches for 1kg beef.  Put the browned beef in your slow cooker. \n\n4.  Fry the onion in the pan with the beef fat, about 10 mins minimum to soften them.  While that's cooking, put the rehydrated chillies in a blender with about 1 tbsp each cumin and oregano, and about 1 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Add tomato paste and some juice from the tomato cans and some liquid from the chilli soak if needed and blend to a smooth paste. \n\n5.  Add the garlic to the onions and allow it to colour slightly.  Add the spice paste to the onions and allow to cook a little bit.   Ad the tomatoes, beans and bell pepper if using.  Add some liquid, maybe 200ml, judge by eye for this.  Add a stock cube. Bring to a simmer and then add about half a small cup of coffee (maybe 200mls?) and 1 square dark chocolate.  Don't worry if you can smell cinnamon, it will dissipate. \n\n6. Add to slow cooker and mix the beef with this sauce.  Add  some water if you think it's dry but remember you don't need as much as a stove top chilli. \n\n7. Cook for 6-8 hours...",

Dump all this into the crock pot with the base. \n\nNow in a big pan (preferably cast iron), brown 1 pound of chorizo (beef or pork) and 3 pounds of beef or turkey or venison (I hunt, got lots of deer meat so that's what I use). Get a good browning on the meat, none of this sad gray steamed meat shit. If you're using an oven safe pan, don't be afraid to throw it under the broiler to help the browning process. Once the meat is browned, deglaze the pan with beer and dump the whole shebang into the crock pot. Don't you dare drain the fat.\n\nAdd like 4 squares of bakers chocolate or 2 tbsp of cocoa powder.\n\nAdd one 14oz can of red kidney beans and one 14oz can of black beans (drained).\n\nAdd 2 cans of rotel diced tomatoes, drained\n\nAdd a 12oz can of tomato paste\n\nAdd a 14 oz can of tomato sauce\n\nIf there's any room left in the pot, fill it with spicy V8 vegetable juice or another can of tomato sauce.\n\nLeave this all on high until it smells too good to resist it anymore.

When it smells good you\u2019ve added enough or just use store bought) transfer to slow cooker once browned \nCook the onion/ spicy peppers (I use habeneros, Serranos and jalepenos) shredded carrots/ celery/ mushroom whatever\u2019s in the fridge really in the beef fat until it\u2019s softened then transfer to slow cooker\nAdd can of tomato sauce \nAdd more chili powder, a skootch of cinnamon, crushed red pepper, salt, pepper, and hot sauce to taste \nDrain and rinse 3 cans of beans (doesn\u2019t matter what but I like kidney, black, and chili beans) add to slow cooker\nAdd a can or two of diced tomatoes \n(If it\u2019s looking too thick add water, tomato sauce, or even stock whatever is in the pantry)\nLet it cook for about two hours or until it smells too good to resist and then take it off the heat and add fresh cilantro (I cut up an entire bunch) I throw about 3/4 of it directly into the chili and save some for garnish, i juice a half a lime and stir that in and leave the other half in wedges for garnish\nHope this helps!",

And the mix of lean ground turkey and greasy italian sausage was perfect. I think I might have added too many jalapenos tho, take some out to make it less spicy. But the chili peppers and the serrano peppers are great flavor! Pro tip - roast the peppers on a cast iron skillet for a bit before you throw em in, really brings out the flavor.",

But tastes good on it's own, without heat.\n\nJenni at the Soup Palette competed in the 2023 Durango Snowdown Chili Cook-Off. Her yak chili took 1st Place for Judge\u2019s Choice and 2nd Place for People\u2019s Choice.  \nHere\u2019s the award-winning recipe. Let us know what you think, if you cook it. We appreciate everyone\u2019s feedback. Just remember Jenni is a professional chef who cooks by instinct to create her recipes. As she told me, she hopes she didn't forget anything.  \n2 Tbs Olive or Avocado oil  \n1 cup diced Vidalia onion  \n1 red or orange pepper, diced  \n\u00bd jalapeno pepper, minced  \n3-4 garlic cloves, minced  \n2 lbs ground Chama Valley yak  \n1/4 cup carrots, minced  \n1 tsp salt  \nHeat large dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add oil. When hot, add all ingredients and cook for 15 minutes.  \nAdd \u00bd can classic beer, such as a lager. (\u00bd for the chili; \u00bd for you.)  \nSimmer the mixture for 15-20 minutes to deglaze the meat \u2013 the alcohol will allow the meat flavors to more fully transfer to the sauce.  \nSpices:  \nIn a large bowl thoroughly mix together:  \n\u00bd Tbs New Mexican red chile powder  \n1 tsp cayenne powder  \n1 Tbs dark chili powder  \n\u00bd cup diced green chili \u2013 canned is fine  \n\u00bd Tbs cumin  \n1 tsp Kosher salt  \n1 tsp black pepper  \nAdd to bowl:  \n2 15 oz cans diced tomatoes  \n2 15 oz cans tomato sauce  \n2 cup beef broth  \n1-2 tsp Worcestershire sauce  \nAdd spice mixture to the ground yak. Simmer for a minimum of 1 hour.  \nTaste the chili \u2013 At this point, Jen usually adds a pinch or two of each spice, and sometimes a dash of sugar or 1 Tbs black coffee.  \nThe chili should have a thick meaty consistency.  \nWhen satisfied with flavor, emulsify in blender 1-2 turns.

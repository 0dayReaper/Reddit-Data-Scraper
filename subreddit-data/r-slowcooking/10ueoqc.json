            "comment": "We normally don't use our slow cooker.  I think this may be the only meal we ever make in it.  It's technically a plain old chili that you can modify to your tastes.  Originally meant for ground beef but can easily substitute turkey.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 2 lbs ground meat - beef or turkey are the only options I used but I'm sure others can be used too.\n* 1 med onion diced or half of a huge onion - I use sweet or yellow\n* 4 cloves garlic finely chopped\n* 2 carrots finely chopped\n* 3 jalapeno peppers, sliced into rings\n* 3 TBS ground chili powder\n* 2 TSP ground cumin\n* salt and pepper to taste\n* 28oz can diced tomatoes\n* 28oz can tomato sauce\n* 2 15oz cans of kidney beans - I use one light and one dark\n\n**Instructions**\n\n* Cut up all the vegetables and set on your biggest cutting board\n* Brown the meat in a skillet - drain excess fat and liquid but keep a little back\n* Add the chili powder and cumin and toast spices with the meat\n* Dump the tomato products and veggies into the crockpot along with the meat\n* Cook on low for 8 hours\n* Drain and rinse kidney beans and then add to the chili\n* Set slow cooker to high and cook 15 to 20 min.  Note, if carrots are still a little crunchy, keep cooking on high until they are moderately tender\n\nNotes:  If you want to take the effort, you could probably sautee the onions for about 5 min or until they are translucent, add garlic and sautee for 30 sec to a min until fragrant.  Then add the diced tomatoes and sautee for about 3 to 5 min more.  I've never done it this way for the slow cooker but have done this with a dutch oven.\n\nForgot to mention - I sprayed the ceramic liner with non-stick cooking spray before adding anything.",

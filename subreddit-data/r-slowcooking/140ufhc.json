Add mixture on top of swiss cheese. \n\nStep 4: Open stuffing and add uncooked to the top of the cream of chicken and sour cream mix\n\nStep 5: Add the melted butter evenly to the top of the stuffing mix. \n\nStep 6: Cook on high for 3-4 hours or low for 4-6 hours.

            "comment": "Can't edit post recipe, but worth mentioning: A half stick of butter would probably also work.\n\nAnother good thing about this one: Don't like the veggies? Use different ones or don't add them at all. The original recipe is no veggies/just chicken. I could see carrots, peas, or celery working in this too. \n\nIf you want \"crispier\" stuffing: add the soup mix and THEN the cheese after. \n\nI've seen people add seasoning to the chicken before adding it to the crock pot. You can do that, but you won't need a lot. You'll get a lot of flavor from the cream of chicken soup, cheese, sour cream, and the stuffing mix. I could see adding seasoning to the chicken being a good idea if you're serving children and they won't eat the stuffing, though. Honestly, though, if you have a texture kid or a no-mixed-food kid, use this on a night they can eat something else. I don't think this one is for them lol. \n\nThis may be one of the rare recipes that's better to cook on high. It lowers the risk of burning the stuffing along the sides.\n\nFun note about this recipe: A youtube channel I watch called the baked version of it \"Aunt Motor's Chicken\". I love that, but decided to call it by the original Swiss Chicken name here to not confuse people.",

This recipe is VERY Midwest US/Southern US in nature. Stovetop has been the go-to stuffing my whole life, but I think that's the only part of the recipe that may not be easy to access or may need to be replaced outside of the USA.",

Only difference is I cube my chicken and add broccoli and onions:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5sUpKmtDUZI\n\nSince the video doesn't give measurements:\n\nI use 1 cup of sour cream and 1/2 to 1 whole stick of butter. I add one whole onion and one broccoli head, but veggies can be done to taste. You also may want to add garlic or a chicken bouillon cube to boost flavor.",

Sorry once more.   \n   \nBuuuut I'm curious enough to give it a try :D   \n\nSo... Do you have an idea how I could replace the stuffing? Stuffed turkey is very rare over here in Europe, so wont find stuffing in supermarkets. Thank you!",

That may work. \n\nReally the stuffing mix is just dried bread and seasoning/herbs I think. You may be able to look up a recipe for \"homemade dry stuffing mix\" \n\nProbably not ideal, but you can also order Stovetop on Amazon.\n\nI knew the ladies of youtube wouldn't let us down.

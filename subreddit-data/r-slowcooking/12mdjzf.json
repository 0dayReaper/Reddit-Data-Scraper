Or using it as a dip for chips, or a salsa alternative for nachos. It's yummy and honestly after a day in the fridge getting to know each other, all the ingredients taste the same even if you don't scoop out tortellini or chicken.",

Getting any dish nuclear hot is gonna prevent you from, well, enjoying it obviously, but you\u2019re not going to have the chance to taste it. Sure the microwave saves time up front but by the time you wait long enough for it to cool, you could have warmed it gently on the stove top without risking further cooking and potentially overcooking it.  Just put it over medium heat until it\u2019s warm enough to eat the moment it hits the table.",

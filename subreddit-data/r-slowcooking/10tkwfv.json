Tenderloin is a part of the cow that has many different cuts... you can get a filet mignon out of a tenderloin, or you can get a small roast cut, or a large roast cut, or steaks, etc.. Tenderloin, tri tip, rib eye, etc. are indeed names of cuts from the cow, but those can be broken down in other, more specific types of cuts... such as steak or roast. \n\n[Here](https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/all-about-beef-roasts-from-chuck-to-rump-article) is an article explaining roast cuts in more detail... or you could literally just google it, because the information is very available and very clear. I'm sorry that facts make you big mad.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: My guy had to block me because he was getting \"roasted.\" Sorry, I had to. Anyway, in response to your nonsense:\n\n\"Roasts are cut from the steer's chuck, or shoulder; the rib and loin areas; the round, or butt and back leg, and the brisket, or chest.\n\nGenerally, fattier roasts come from the animal's forequarter, or front end, Gathy said.\n\nOr think of it this way: The most tender\u2014and expensive\u2014roasts come from the parts that move the least (think rib roast and tenderloin). Conversely, the tougher roasts that take best to braising come from the areas that get the most exercise, like the round. \"\n\nTell me you didn't read the article without telling me you didn't read the article. \n\nYou could try to give me a source for your logic, but you'll probably just stay mad in your corner.",

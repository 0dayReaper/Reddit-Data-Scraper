It\u2019s just about how fast it\u2019s brought up to temperature. So like 4 hours on high = 8 hours on low.\n\nIf your slow cooker is like that, then high then low is functionally just putting it on high, and low then high is functionally just low.\n\nIf you need it to cook in 6 hours could you delay the start by 2 hours and then just do high for 4?",

I kept it simple as traditionally that\u2019s the way it should be but I added some things for extra flavour.\n\nI saut\u00e9ed two small white onions with a little garlic for about 10 minutes and put aside. Then I floured and browned 500g of lean beef with a little salt in two batches.\n\nI used around 8 to ten chantenay carrots, just cut in half and three medium sized Maris Piper potatoes roughly cut and half a swede.\n\nI added those to the bottom of the slow cooker, put the meat and onions on top, added half a litre of extra stout Guinness, some more salt half a teaspoon of garlic some Swartz black and red pepper and two knorr rich beef stock pots. I then added water to cover everything.\n\nI cooked on high for around 9 hours and added about a teaspoon of MSG to bring out the flavour.  \n\nThe swede almost completely disintegrated which along with some flaky bits of meat made the sauce a lot thicker.\n\nThat\u2019s about it really. It\u2019s my first slow cooker meal and I\u2019m surprised that it\u2019s the best stew I\u2019ve ever made. I\u2019ve never used Guinness before so it could be that or the msg which I just ordered online and have never tried before. Hope that helps.\n\nEdit: I definitely threw a chuck of butter in there at some stage.",

The ingredients of traditional soda bread are flour, baking soda, salt, and buttermilk. The buttermilk in the dough contains lactic acid, which reacts with the baking soda to form tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide. Other ingredients can be added, such as butter, egg, raisins, or nuts.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

A white stew is just everything thrown in the pot, no browning anything beforehand. Which makes a more watery colored dish like they said.\n\nHonestly, I'd avoid calling anything an Irish stew unless you're in Ireland and that's what the locals called it. It's just not clear what a true Irish stew is. Too many people have differing opinions.",

    "postText": "I've come across this sub reddit and seen lots of inaccurate food safety information given as fact. Particularly when it comes to botulism. Given a background of biology and pathogens I'd like to chime in.\n\n185\u00b0F WILL denature toxins over time. This WILL NOT kill all botulism bacteria. They are capable of entering a thermally resistant state, this requires a temperature of at least 250\u00b0F.  \n\nMany comments I've seen here are saying the total opposite and to toss food because the toxins can't break down or that food is safe because the bacteria is dead.\n\nPlease don't give food safety advice unless you actually understand pathogens.",

And largely in a cooking at home situation botulism is never really a concern. Now if we're talking about canning shit I can understand OP's concern, but still very much doubt their experience in the field.\n\nLike you said, a background in biology does not equal a food science degree or experience.",

At the end of the day or maybee 4 hours later the food is cooked.  Now because it is constantly cooling down there is a technical theory that the pathogens can breed. So what is advised is that the food is heated to a certain temprature and maintained at that temp to kill pathogens. It is known to be a problem but not a serious one for healthy people it's only the old that you really have to worry about. \n\nWhen I go touring I use a vacume flask to slow cook food. It saves loads of energy.",

As a kid, I was always running around outside in the streets, playing up the Thames on dirty old boats and then we\u2019d head to the shop and get sone sweets. No hands were washed. As a teen, I used to work at a riding school and regularly had horse shit and dirt under my finger nails, everyone did. We just cracked open our sandwiches and ate. As a kid, and still as an adult, I rarely get ill. If I do get ill, something that\u2019ll hang around for 7-10 days for most people, gets me for 3-5 then I\u2019m right as a rain. I\u2019ve sat next to people coughing and spluttering all over me knowing full well I won\u2019t get ill\u2026 and I don\u2019t. Being too clean is actually bad for you. I\u2019m not suggesting people go eat rotten meat, fur covered bread and never wash their hands, but for Christ sake people are so OTT about everything. It\u2019s ridiculous.",

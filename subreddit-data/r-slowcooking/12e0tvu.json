I couldn't find that video again if I tried so I figured I'd just ask for some favorites here.\n\nI'm mainly looking for something Mexican, South American, or Asian flavored stuff, but I'm open to try anything!",

Slice up two medium onions into thin rings and distribute them across the bottom of the slow cooker. Put the pork on top of the onions. Pour in one bottle of Founder\u2019s Backwoods Bastard. Toss in the remaining spices. The reason for the brown sugar is to balance the bitterness of the beer.\n\nCook pork for 8-10 hours (my pork shoulder cuts are usually 2-3 lbs each, so 8 to 8.5 hours for me).\n\nWhen it\u2019s done, use two forks to shred the pork in the liquid, add about an ounce of caramelized onions (I make a batch and freeze them for this\u2014just throw a big lump into the hot pork), and add about a half teaspoon of boiled apple cider syrup (King Arthur recipe). Add salt and pepper to taste.\n\nThe result is a very tender and saucy pork that has a sweet/savory flavor and a beer/cider note.",

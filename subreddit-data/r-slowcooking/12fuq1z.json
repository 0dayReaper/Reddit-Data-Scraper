    "postText": " I want to slow cook.  Badly.  It looks and tastes wonderful.  But every  crock pot I've ever owned is always too hot.  It boils the meat.  It  cooks too fast.  I've tried rival and some other big brand.  I've read  that new crockpots have minimum temp requirements that are higher now.   Suggestions have been find an old one at a garage sale or thermostat  types.  I cook for two people.  I'm willing to spend for quality  product.  Everything is 5 stars on amazon; hoping for real feedback.   Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you",

I have an older one and it has held up well. They're all 6 qts but even though you're cooking for two it's nice to have room to cook corned beef, a roast, or a whole chicken. \n\nAlso, they have a ton of slow cooker recipes on their website. If they suddenly started making slow cookers that ran warmer, they would have to change all their recipes. If they did that, every person who had an older one of their slow cookers would now find their recipes unreliable and that's not good for getting people to buy more of your appliances.",

            "comment": "Any crockpot will do- perhaps seal the meat first, get that nice caramelisation going on which keeps the moisture in. Also, you rarely need liquids in a crockpot unless you\u2019re making soup and even then it\u2019s sparingly.\n\nDon\u2019t loose faith. You can do this and produce the meal you want to eat for dayyyyys\u2026",

Should it show signs of cooked by now or am I paranoid?\n\nEdit/Update: \n\nFirst of all, I can't believe I got downvoted for not knowing how to cook chicken \ud83d\udc80 Idk why some of you are so pretentious about slowcooking but anyway\n\nChicken was absolutely banger. I put it on high for about 30 mins just to ease my brain. no one shit themselves so I think I'm doing alright.\n\n4 chicken thighs\n3/4 cup soy sauce\n5 cloves garlic \n1/2 cup honey (this was too much I'd maybe do 1/3 or 1/4 next time\n2 tbsp peanut butter\nbit of mirin\nbit of sesame oil\nbit of grated ginger\n2 white part scallion\n1 tbsp miso paste\nbit of chilli oil or sriracha if you're into that\n\ncooked for about 2 and a half hours. took thighs out and shredded them, poured sauce into a saucepan and thickened with rice flour (I didn't have corn starch). served with rice and broccolini",

It will get hot enough to kill the germs that are in there for the 1-2 hours at the beginning. \n\nSlow cookers have been around for ages. I have cooked chicken in mine many times. The only way you are going to end up with food safety issues is if you put frozen chicken in there, or if you don't cook it long enough. Or if your slow cooker is just broken, which you would know by now. \n\nIf you are worried it's not cooking fast enough, put on high for an hour. And for goodness sake, why are you even looking at something in a slow cooker after only an hour? It's SLOW. Let it do its job already!",

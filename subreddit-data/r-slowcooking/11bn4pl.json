            "comment": "A cottage pie recipe from a friend, which fills a 6-qt slow cooker and a 9x13 pan.  We love it, the flavor is rich and amazing, and the leftovers get *very* happily finished.  If you're watching carbs or want it to be slow-cooker-only, just do the stew steps and enjoy.\n\n**Stew:**\n\n* 2 lb stew beef, cubed\n* 16\u201332 oz of frozen mixed vegetables (we use 32oz corn, peas, carrots, and green beans)\n* 2 yellow onions, chopped\n* 1 cup beef broth   \n*and* 2 tbsp Better than Bouillon beef bouillon paste (we BtB the whole thing)\n* 1 cup vegetable broth\n* 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce\n* 2 tbsp tomato paste\n* 1 tbsp Montreal Steak seasoning\n\nAdd everything to slow cooker and stir gently, just enough to mix everything together.  Cook on high for 4 hours.  Change temperature to low and cook for an additional 4\u20138 hours.\n\n**Mashed Potatoes:**\n\n* 4 large russet potatoes, peeled and quartered\n* 1 cup milk\n* 1 stick salted butter, softened or melted\n* 1/4 cup fresh (or dried) chives, diced\n* 1 tsp salt\n* 1 tsp coarse ground black pepper\n\nAdd potatoes to a pot of water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Once boiling, lower temperature to medium-high and cook for 12\u201315 minutes until you can easily poke a fork through the potatoes.  Drain the water off and return the pot and potatoes back to the stove top.  Add the milk, butter, chives, and seasonings to the pot and use a potato masher to mash everything together until smooth and well mixed.\n\n**Cottage Pie:**\n\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees.  Use a slotted spoon or ladle to scoop the stew into a casserole dish. The stew should ideally be around 2 inches deep; be careful not to add so much broth that it drowns the meat and vegetables \\[we like it with the broth maybe half way up the solids\\].  Gently scoop the mashed potatoes onto the stew in the casserole dish and smooth it out until it covers everything evenly.  Use a fork to gently score a ripple pattern into the top of the potatoes.  Sprinkle some black pepper over the potatoes.  Bake the casserole dish uncovered for 15\u201320 minutes until the stew is bubbling.  Switch the oven over to broil for 2\u20135 minutes until the peaks of the mashed potatoes have browned.",

Set aside to dice up later. 4 cans of French cut style green beans with seasoning added. 1 can of wax beans. 5 cans of tomato sauce 8 ounces each. Tbs of basil, tbs of jaynes mixed up salt, tsp s+p but can add during cooking to adjust palette, couple of splashes of worchestire sauce but you can also adjust add more during cooking. 1 bay leaf. I usually drain most of the water from the beans except 1-2 cans (it will evaporate later. I medium onion diced small. I usually do the bacon first and patted dry with the towel and set it in the microwave to chill out. Then I add the remaining ingredients into the pot and turn it on \nsimmer and then while it\u2019s simmering I either do the bacon by hand or dice it up with a knife And then add it to the ingredients. Then once it reaches a boil, I turn it down and let it simmer for anywhere up to 1 to 3 hours and I check on it every 30 minutes to adjust the flavors to my liking with it being adding more Worcestershire sauce, or salt and pepper, or the Jaynes mixed up salt. This is a recipe my dad whipped up one day and I make it at least 3 to 5 times a year especially during the winter time. This is from memory and I grew up a big meat and potatoes fan so not all palettes are equal. You can also add a couple of tablespoons of butter when you first put in all the ingredients if you like.

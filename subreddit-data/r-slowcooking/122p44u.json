I overfill it all the time so I'm always cleaning the streaks. It could handle a medium or small chicken, probably not a whole big one. It wasn't so cheap, but it has lasted for over 15 years and I love it. \n\nAlso consider one with a small rack for the inside if you cook meats without a floor of veggies or some liquid to prevent sticking.",

Beef wont have enough fat to fry it in and get the crisp. Just make Carne Deshebrada which is beef boiled with spices until tender then shredded. Chuck is perfect for it se lots of water and add any combo of  onion, garlic cloves, bay leaves, peppercorns, cumin seeds, and oregano. Use lots of water and spices so you have a nice broth to use for stews, sauces, etc.",

Turn the meat after it has cooked for 5 hours. When the pork is tender, remove from slow cooker, and shred with two forks. Use cooking liquid as needed to moisten the meat.

Squeeze fresh lime juice over the carnitas on the baking sheet. Broil the carnitas until the meat gets a little crispy around the edges of the pieces of meat.\n\nI do this with pork shoulder, I think it would also be good with beef.",

I mean we aren't taking ground up chicken, mixing \"Indian Spices\" with it and calling it meatloaf. ETA: Just because you bake it in the oven to dry it out after boiling the meat is NOT making it carnitas....it is boiled meat dried out. Crisp from carnitas comes from frying it in it's own fat",

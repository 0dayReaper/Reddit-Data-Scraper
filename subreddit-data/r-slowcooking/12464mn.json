There are people who swear the seal transfers flavors and others that disagree. I think some people are more sensitive to it than others, and I think the same goes for odors. If you find that the smell affects other recipes, you might see if you can get a second lid for recipes that are outside your normal flavor profile. \n\nIf you find that you don't notice the smell transferring to other recipes, know that you scrubbed it well, and then ask yourself if that lid deserves more of your energy or attention. You know it's clean, and it's not going to ruin your next meal. Then go find something fun to spend your time, energy, and attention on.",

The seal on my instant pot even gets stained red. It might not come out in a wash but if I use it the next time for like stew or something else it seems to get corrected lol. I'd imagine you could probably do some kind of self clean, maybe just put water and some vinegar in it and let it go for 20 min to get rid of it. I have yet to see any evidence of a transfer of taste or smell.\n\nAlso to note. As someone who cooks alot myself as well as having some years of professional experience, most nonstick cookware will retain a smell even after a thorough cleaning. I can clean the shit out of my deep walled skillet I use for making spaghetti sauce or taco meat and it will usually still smell a bit of cumin or oregano.",

I followed the recipe linked below, I follow this youtuber for Meal Prep but used his recipe for dinner and was so happy with the result. The problem is he's only done one Indian Recipe and I can't really find any other Indian Slow Cooker recipes.\r  \n\r  \nMy question is can I convert normal Indian Curry Recipes to Slow Cooker Recipes by just changing the cooking method? if I do, do I need to account for the method of cooking and add in any extra spices or am I just good to go? Any help would be awesome and really appreciated! Thanks!\r  \n\r  \nTikki Masala Recipe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htBToHNPqoI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htBToHNPqoI)",

Even after blending they still retained a gritty texture.\n\n\u2022 Cut the broth in half, especially if you\u2019re using a full can or coconut milk. I did need to add about a teaspoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce. I may actually use coconut cream instead and keep the broth the same next time for the thickness. I also added a couple of tablespoons of heavy cream at the end to give it more depth. \n\n\u2022 I know this recipe uses chicken for ease and calories, but when I get korma in a restaurant I prefer lamb or goat as the protein. Personally I felt the chicken was kind of bland and didn\u2019t add a lot as it was cooking down.\n\n\u2022 This recipe basically has zero spice. I don\u2019t like my Indian food super spicy, but you will definitely need to adjust your heat depending on personal preference.",

Tika Masala is actually one of my go to meal preps for when I\u2019m short on time or just plain lazy. \n\nSlow cookers are great for certain things for sure. But a very important part of Indian cooking is briefly frying the spices in oil or fat prior to adding other ingredients. This not only results in a more flavorful dish but also helps avoid the gastric irritation that sometimes accompanies eating heavily seasoned/spiced foods.",

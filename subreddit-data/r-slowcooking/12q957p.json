    "postText": "I'm cooking a brisket and want to let it develop some kind of a crust, and thought about broiling (how long btw?) it for a bit in the oven. But I wonder what if I left a small opening with the lid for vapor to escape.\nWould this help at all? Would it increase my cooking time?\nAny thoughts pls",

Until the crust develops as you would like - check on it and visually evaluate it.  The direct heat is what forms the crust, not the ambient heat so opening the door doesn't affect the broiling.\n\n\nEdited - fixed a great typo.",

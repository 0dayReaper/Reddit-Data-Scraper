    "postText": "Hi everyone! Recently tried making a chuck roast in a slowcooker and accidentally left it on too long making it tough and hard. It's my first time using a slow cooker and I was probably just being dumb, but is there any way to salvage it? Would cooking it longer with some water be able to help salvage the meat at all?\n\nUPDATE: Dumped in some gravy, nuked in a microwave, turned out delicious! I will make sure to not be dumb next time",

What cooker you\u2019re using.\n\nIn general, when meat gets \u201chard\u201d it just needs to go longer. Chuck is a shoulder cut, and has some of the most fat in a single part of the cow, it\u2019s got a ton of connective tissue to break down, and when it does, the meat will be like jello. \n\nRARELY does a piece of chuck come back around again to tough and inedible, so either you let it slow cook for like 8 hours without water ok whatever the highest setting, and it\u2019s literal charcoal, or you just need to let it cook.\n\nSome crock pots mixed with some cuts of beef could take quite a while to braise a roast. Full shoulder clod would take about three hours in an oven, imagine how long it would take in a crock pot.",

I'm not the best at cooking and didn't research how to properly use a slow cooker beforehand so I guess a lot of it is on me. Here's the recipe I used: [https://thatsdeelicious.com/mexican-shredded-beef/](https://thatsdeelicious.com/mexican-shredded-beef/). I halved the measurements because the roast I had was about half the weight.\n\nI slow cooked it on low for around 8 hours overnight and them left it on keep warm until dinner. I guess the main issue was it becoming too cooled down on the keep warm setting? For some reason I thought slow cookers could keep things warm for a while, but looking more into it it looks like you aren't supposed to do this haha. So the meat is shredded but it's pretty tough to chew through/dry since I'm guessing it didn't have enough liquid and I just left it in there too long on keep warm. Any way I can salvage this?\n\nNext time I'll time it more appropriately to when I can actually eat it and also do it a little longer; thanks for the advice so far!",

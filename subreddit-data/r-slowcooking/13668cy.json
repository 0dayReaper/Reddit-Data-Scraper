Served over angel hair pasta, the picture is the leftovers. It\u2019s ok, but not great. It seems to be missing something. I think I will try with boneless skinless thighs, but I\u2019m not sure that will fix it. Anyone have a similar recipe they like? Maybe capers at the end?",

            "comment": "There\u2019s a lot of issues with this recipe, really fundamental issues that are gonna prevent you from ever ending up with a great dish when it\u2019s said and done. Really what\u2019s kind of worse, and this is no slight to you op- it\u2019s just a bad recipe, is that this same basic dish done much tighter and more efficiently, would be far less time consuming to put together and exponentially better if it avoided the slow cooker all together. You can put together a better, infinitely better version of this dish in a single skillet in about 30 mins. Maybe 40 with prep time. \n\nThe issues I see in this recipe are many. It says you can brown the chicken first or not (just terrible advice/directions) and that\u2019s after telling you to fry the chicken cutlets up and then dump them into the slow cooker for 3+ hours. There\u2019s no way a chicken cutlet, or butterflied breast will survive that much time in the slow cooker. It will be dry as a desert and no amount of sauce will ever hide those crimes. The tomato sauce and flour thing is frankly just bizarre and unnecessary, the garlic goes in totally raw\u2026really just ditch this recipe altogether, it can be done better, easier. Any time you come across a recipe with a name like this, be skeptical of it, because it\u2019s probably about as good as it\u2019s silly name. \n\nThere\u2019s just this tendency for people to write these totally unnecessary slow cooker recipes because it\u2019s become a kind of kitchen hack-y type thing to do and 99% of them are clearly written by people with no understanding of the very basics in the kitchen. Not to sound like I\u2019m above that, but slow cookers are great for a lot of things but recipes like this demand unnecessary and frankly dumb things of them and it\u2019s because of this rush to spit out tik tok worthy recipes. \n\nPrep everything you need, break down a few boneless skinless breasts into 2-3 filets, season with salt, pepper, (smoked) paprika and dust with flour- lightly. Get a skillet on high heat, cast iron is good for this, stainless is great, non stick is not so great for this but it\u2019ll be ok In the absence of the others.  this is all gonna happen somewhat quickly so have everything ready to go right into the pan (cleaned and pre cut). \n\nSkillet over high heat, 1-2 tbsp of vegetable oil, toss in the chicken and brown on each side. Only going to about 90% so they will carry over to temp off the heat, so pull them and let \u2018em chill on a plate. In the same pan, right away before the stuff in the pan burns, reduce heat just a bit and toss in some minced shallot, garlic, and those sun dried tomatoes. Once those shallots go translucent and the Garlic is smelling good, hit it with 2 or 3 tbsp of chicken stock, and scrape the crusty stuff up into the broth. To that, then add a tablespoon or two of heavy cream, mix together, then add a few cups or marinara sauce. You\u2019re making a tomato cream sauce here. Kind of\nLike a vodka sauce without the vodka, although that would totally be acceptable here. \n\nTake some cooked pasta (something that will hang on to a heavy sauce- ditch the angel hair and save it for butter/oil/white wine sauces, try fettuccine, penne, rigatoni) toss it in the pan with the sauce and let them cook together for 2-3 minutes on med. this gives the two time to marry and you don\u2019t  end up with that cold lump of flavorless pasta sitting on the plate with a blob of sauce on it, the two never becoming a single unified thing. Don\u2019t know how that became a thing people do. I blame prego and ragu. then that goes to the plate, slice your chicken and place on top, hit it with some fresh, minced parsley and shredded/shaved parm and enjoy a meal worth marrying someone over. From 3 hours and shit to 30 minutes and awesome.",

I\u2019ve worked in the restaurant Industry my entire life and I\u2019ve seen some really bad cooks in that time, but never one that would hammer a chicken breast filet for 3 hours.\n\nAlso thanks. Most people are offended if I write anything longer than a few sentences. I\u2019ve been accused countless times of writing essays and novels in the comments.  As a matter of fact, someone called me a narcissist with a savior complex and didn\u2019t wanna read my \u2018novel\u2019 in this very thread.

Pan roasted chicken cutlets with pasta in a sun dried tomato cream sauce does not pair with either soy or Worcestershire, both sauces being basically umami bombs that neither play well with those flavors or are necessary. There\u2019s so much savory flavor in the dish as it is, there\u2019s seriously no need to punch it up with either sauce. Let the dish be what it is and let it shine for itself. Unnecessary elements on the plate are just that. More practical and simple improvements to any dish like using higher quality ingredients or reallly nailing the cook on something are way more effective at improving the dish than any twisted slice of lemon will ever be. Most of the time, done correctly, when you see a sauce at the bottom of a plate, it\u2019s because it is an integral part of the dish and not an accoutrement. \n\nAnd for real, not coming at you or anything, not personal at all, just by virtue of the nature of a cooking sub, I think it\u2019s worth handing out good, accurate Advice- since everyone here is looking to improve their game. \n\nAlso, doing (attempting to make) lines or spoon pushes of thin sauces don\u2019t work, and is entirely distracting from all the hard work you put into the sauce of the dish to begin with. Saucing the sauce is entirely unnecessary. That\u2019s why you kinda never see that.",

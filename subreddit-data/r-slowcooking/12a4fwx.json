Rice, roasted potatoes, or roasted broccoli are my usual sides. Canned green beans and corn are easy and my kid will eat those. Can make sandwiches, tacos, and quesadillas with the meat too if you\u2019re feeling like it. \n\nThe only full meal thing I ever really do in the crock is chili. That\u2019s pretty easy to make out of almost all canned stuff and not that bad for you if you get low salt higher quality canned goods. Brown some meat, add beans, tomato, mushrooms, corn, green chilis, a little broth, and some good seasonings. I like to top with sour cream, shredded cheese, and diced onions(white or green).\n\nHopefully these don\u2019t sound like food that will make you sick! My wife had super bad nausea with both of our kids and I bought her these lemon ginger lozenges and earth mama tea on Amazon if you want to try anything like that. She also had a little relief switching to a different prenatal(smarty pants gummies) but probably supposed to ask your doctor first for that. Good luck!",

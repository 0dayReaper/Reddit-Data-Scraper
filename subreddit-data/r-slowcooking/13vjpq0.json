    "postText": "Hello, I will be getting a really good deal on some pork half loins and would like some ideas for recipes to use them in. \n\nMy household is 2 adults and 1 child, I will be cutting the loins down into portions and freezing them. I'd really enjoy some recipes that are either very hearty or healthy/vegetable filled. \n\nI know I can just do a classic loin with carrots, onions, and potatoes. However, I'd like to expand on what I can do with them even more. Any help would be very appreciated, thank you \u2764\ufe0f",

While I know it is sacrilegious not to put it over rice when my wife isn\u2019t home I often put it over mashed potatoes",

I did a couple test runs of me cutting them into bite sized pieces, then searing them in oil on the stove, added panda express orange sauce for 1 test and sweet n sour for the other. Steamed veggies and had over rice. It was pure heaven.\n\nI really want to try slow cooking it cut up in a soy sauce, sugar, and cooking sake marinade. Let it go till the pieces are extremely tender and filled with the flavors, have that with rice. \n\nWas also thinking of doing some curry with rice or pork, onions, and mushrooms slow cooked brown gravy over potatos.",

This is pretty basic for most Filipinos though a lot of people still use a massive amount of brown sugar rather than coke.     \n\nWhen in the US I use cider vinegar rather than a more traditional red can vinegar.  For chicken or fish I switch the coke to sprite and some of the vinegar to lemon or lime juice.  \n\nIf you are slow cooking this use larger pieces as the acidity will break down small pieces too much and make it go to mush",

Mix the last 3 ingredients and pour over pork.  Cook on high about 4 hours, and shred.  Cook a bit longer for the meat to absorb the flavor.  You have to ladle out some of the liquid after that. We serve it on rice, 'cos it's too wet to put in tortillas or burger buns.  We just call it \"Mexican pork\".  Don't trim the fat off, it's better if you let it melt into the broth.",

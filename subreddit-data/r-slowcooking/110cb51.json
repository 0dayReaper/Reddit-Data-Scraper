And is it true that you don\u2019t need to add water when cooking meat in the slow cooker? I\u2019m just scared that I might burn it or something.\nThanks!!",

To avoid possibly burning the bottom of the meat, and to get a better over all roast, you could set it on a silicon rack (like any of the ones in the link).\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/s?k=slow+cooker+silicon+rack&amp;crid=212B7G9IDDRJB&amp;sprefix=slow+cooker+silicon+rack%2Caps%2C330&amp;ref=nb\\_sb\\_noss\\_2](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=slow+cooker+silicon+rack&amp;crid=212B7G9IDDRJB&amp;sprefix=slow+cooker+silicon+rack%2Caps%2C330&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2)\n\nAnd, for recipes, try YouTube.  They have lots there.\n\n  \n[https://www.youtube.com/results?search\\_query=leg+of+lamb+slow+cooker](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=leg+of+lamb+slow+cooker)",

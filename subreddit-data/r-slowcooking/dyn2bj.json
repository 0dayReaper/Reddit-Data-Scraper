Unless you had a 30 Amp industrial outlet, you were totally maxing it out with 3000 watts and nearly 25 total amps. Luckily they weren't all heating at the same time and were cycling on and off.",

An 1800 watt max power strip should handle 15 amps max. If you load it with several high Amp devices it might trip. The cheap ones totally trip easy before rated capacity. Especially if they are older. Starting Amp creep is a thing. And when your power strip is rated for 15 , you should probably assume 12 is your reasonable limit. I am of the school of conservative estimates for the bits that will ruin your day.",

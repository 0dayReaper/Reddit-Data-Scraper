I bet that would change with an increase in popularity though. \n\nI read \"Undaunted Courage\" about Lewis and Clark and beaver was the most popular meat for the group.

They create wetlands! \n\nA lot of people don\u2019t understand it unless you frame it differently: beaver activities have the potential to flood homes, agricultural fields, roads, and forests (killing timber and trees).  They\u2019re triggered by the sound of running water, drawing them to block drainage systems.  Coexisting with our valuable \u201chabitat engineers\u201d can create complex problems - we\u2019re working on beaver-proof drainage systems, but in the meantime, removing problem animals is pretty standard.",

People are allowed to be angry over whatever they like, and social media gives everyone a platform.\n\nJust like you are allowed to be angry about people being angry. Which in my opinion, is an odd thing for a person to raise their stress levels for in the grand scheme of things going on in the world, but you do you.\n\nI disagree with you thinking you're not being hypocritical. You have a superiority complex in relation to moral outrage. Moral outrage disgusts you. You are better than moral outrage, and so you perceive yourself as a better person.

I noticed the farmer had a beaver dam near the road that was flooding his fence and asked if he'd like me to try trapping it. He was ecstatic, as it's pretty expensive to hire a beaver trapper.\n\nI trapped it (beaver traps typically dispatch the beaver instantly). I retrieved it the following morning and processed it at home. \n\nI saved the pelt to be tanned for later, and the castor from the beaver to use for future lure. Some people will sell the castor as it is used in perfumes, and even as a food additive in vanilla from what I've read. \n\nI quartered the beaver and vacuum sealed some of the meat for the freezer, and made some of it into the roast.",

They are absolutely necessary for the environment and provide valuable habitat. But being as they are in abundance, there is no reason to worry about their numbers. Additionally, I have only trapped beavers that have been destructive to property and roadways, which our cities and counties want trapped regardless. The state department of transportation traps the same beaver that I do, and they simply throw them in the woods. I trap those same ones, but bring them home as a meal for my family and make use of them. \n\nNot looking to get into an argument here, just wanted to answer your question. All the best.",

OP kept posting the same blog article that looked straight out of a word-count chaser as \u201cproof\u201d and later uploaded a passive aggressive clip of him stirring his dish complete with heavy breathing and a frustrated slamming of his croc pot lid.\n\nAs someone who really only viewed the drama after it was over, and going by the large amount of the OP\u2019s deleted comments, I\u2019d say the OP took the criticism way too harshly.  It\u2019s like a minivan owner insisted he had a pickup truck because he could fit some of the same stuff inside.",

I sprinkled about 3 teaspoons each of oregano, cumin and coriander in, plus a small handful of dried onions.\n* Cook on low for 4 hours (My chicken was still slightly frozen so I went with 5.5 hours.)\n* Shred the chicken (I use a couple of forks)\n* Continue on low for another 30-60 minutes, depending on how tender you want the chicken to be. If you go with less the chicken will be more chunky.\n\nI usually drain off some of the excess liquid but leave enough so that the flavors can continue mixing while in the fridge, it's even better the second day!",

Not trying to be a hater but there have got to be some better slow cooker recipes out there other than: \n\n80lbs or butter and 12 days worth of salt\u2026 and maybe a few veggies to pretend it is healthy.\n\nEdit: also this is just about the worst way to cook a steak I\u2019ve ever seen. Use a cheaper piece of meat. That\u2019s the biggest benefit of slow cooking.",

In some parts of the south fucking up a nice steak is a felony. \n\nThat being said, this did taste good and not overwhelming/overseasoned.\n\nMy takeaways for next time:\n\nStew meat will be just fine. Save the nice meat for something else. \n\nIts a lot of seasoning, but if you remove the sauce from the dish and serve separately/sparingly it works. If you serve it more like a soup much less. This also yielded A LOT of cooked veggies, too. \n\nThe online recipes love the packets and the butter, but you probably don't need the butter. Maybe not as much butter. The packets can so easily be replaced by other things, too. They are not necessary.",

Interesting that you were able to get a sirloin to medium rare in a crockpot, never seen anyone try that before!",

            "comment": "Alright, this recipe is going to take some time to type out. This was definitely the most nervous I've been to try a crock pot recipe.\n\nI'm going to attempt to add some edits for people who do not live in the US to this. Let me know if you see anything that should change.\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\nSirloin Steak (I used two steaks. 2.5-3 pounds total)\n\nGolden Potatoes (3 large potatoes, cubed)\n\nBaby Carrots (1 full bag)\n\nOnion (1 full onion, chopped)\n\n1 tablespoon minced garlic\n\nLipton Onion Soup Mix (two packets)\n\nRanch Seasoning Mix (one packet)\n\nPepper to taste\n\nBay Leaves (two)\n\nBeef Bouillon (2 cubes)\n\nWater (two cups)\n\nButter (1 stick, in slices)\n\n1/3rd cup flour or corn starch (for gravy)\n\n**INGREDIENT SUBS FOR MY NON-USA PALS:**\n\n113.4 grams of butter, in slices\n\nSteak seasoning of your choice can easily replace the ranch seasoning and onion soup mix. Just make sure you have enough for both steak and veggies. Brown Gravy mix may also be a good choice, and based on the brief google search I did that's more readily available outside of the US than the ranch and the onion soup mix. \n\n**STEPS:**\n\n**1) VEGGIES** \\- Add the veggies to the bottom of the crock pot. pour in the water and place the bouillon cubes and bay leaves in it. Sprinkle in pepper to taste. Add half of your butter to the top of the veggies. Add half of your garlic on top, as well.\n\n**For USA readers** \\- Add one of the lipton soup packets to the top of the veggies.\n\n**For non-USA readers** \\- Add half of your steak seasoning to the top of the veggies.\n\n**2) THE STEAK** \\- Put your ranch seasoning packet and your onion soup mix packet in a saucer bowl or large plate. Add pepper to taste. Coat your steak in the seasoning on both sides. Place the steak inside the crock pot and put the rest of the butter on top. Put the rest of the garlic on top as well. Pour in the rest of the seasoning to taste. \n\n**For non-USA readers** \\- Use your steak seasoning of choice instead of the ranch and onion soup mix.\n\n**3) COOKING THE STEAK -** I prefer medium rare steak, so I cooked the steak for 4 hours on low. You can also do 2 hours on high. My veggies were not done at this time, so I covered the crock pot and continued to cook. Be sure to check crock pot cooking times for your preferred level of steak doneness.\n\n**4) REMOVING THE VEGGIES** \\- When your veggies are done, use a straining spoon to remove them and leave the liquid inside. They should be soft enough to insert knife fully.\n\n**5) MAKING THE GRAVY -** Leave the crock pot on. In separate bowl, whisk together corn starch or flour and an equal amount of water. Make sure there are no lumps. Once that is done, slowly pour your mixture into the liquid in the crock pot while stirring. Cook until you reach a desired thickness and then turn off your crock pot.\n\n**6) ENJOY!**\n\nIf you all have any tips for making a perfect crock pot steak, let me know. The steak turned out good, but I bet it could have been even better. The veggies and sauce were perfect.",

The steak wasn't bad, but a friend said they'd teach me to grill soon and that's the better way to do it.",

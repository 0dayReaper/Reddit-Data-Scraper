This is so the hock doesn't disintegrate into the beans.\n\n \n\nDump all of the ingredients, except the vinegar, into your slow cooker. Make sure the water covering everything so the beans do not dry out. Cook on high heat for 8 hours.\n\n \n\nRemove and unwrap the ham hock, and add any meat from the hock back into the beans. Stir in the 3 tablespoons of vinegar tothe pot.\n\n \n\nServe over rice or east as is!\n\n \n\nNotes:\n\nYou don't need to presoak the beans for this recipe\n\nIt really does take a good 8 hours, so give yourself enough time!\n\nRecipe from The Hungry Waitress but it's no longer on the site. I don't do the cheesecloth thing and used more than 1 ham hock because I like the extra meat.",

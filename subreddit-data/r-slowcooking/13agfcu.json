    "postText": "I bought a slow cooker today. Sunbeam brand. \n\nHad my lamb shanks and veg etc on high since 1:30pm. Flipped at 3:30pm seemed fine. Checked at 5pm, wasn\u2019t super hot, carrots still hard. Went to check temp of meat and clearly wasn\u2019t cooked as hard to get thermometer through. \n\nHave whacked it in the oven on high to keep cooking. Anyone experienced this? How to test it works without wasting a whole meal?",

Works great for a hearty lunch, too.\n\nSo long ago, my then-mother-in-law gave me a crock pot because she had an extra. She barely used hers. But I was a very bad cook, the crock pot had a little cookbook pamphlet and I just started following those recipes. The great thing about the crock pot was that it's hard to go wrong.\n\nAnd I still just love everything about it. I'm so glad to have found my people here!

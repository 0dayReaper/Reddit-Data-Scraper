I tried smoking chuck and I could instantly tell it was chuck and didn\u2019t care for it. I do not hate the taste, but I prefer other smoked cuts.  Make a pot roast with chuck and with sirloin roast and I guarantee they taste different. Coulotte/Piranha taste nothing like chuck.  Chuck fat when rendered smells like no other.",

The taste of that beef will only really depend on how it\u2019s prepared, but will always have the main characteristics as any other cut from the same cow. \n\nIf you\u2019re talking about TEXTURE or FAT, then sure, those can be different depending on cut, but muscles from different parts on the same animal will always taste the same. Beef vagina, beef belly/brisket, shoulder cuts/round/chuck, and ribeye, all TASTE the same. \n\nI like to hear different perspectives of things. I was NOT attacking you.",

Perhaps the grade of meat could be a cause?",

I do believe, whole heartedly, and am calling upon my decades of experience in the industry, in the determination that most cuts of beef will taste the same. \n\nI think that it brings up an interesting thing about our senses. There\u2019s some clear bleed from texture to taste, just like smell and memory. So much so even, that different cuts of beef can inform one sense memory or taste memory, and another can trigger an entirely different one, and to the person perceiving it, taste completely different, which I think is a very interesting area of discussion",

It\u2019s really interesting to see all the separate parts of the muscle and will allow you to see the parts you\u2019d rather leave out. \n\nI\u2019m ultimately an advocate for experience, and if you gotta cut out some fat or connective tissue to make something more delicious, then you do you. \n\nAlso helps give you more confidence if you know everything about that muscle group. May not make it more palatable for you, but at least you\u2019ll know why and all that. \n\nEither way I wish you luck.",

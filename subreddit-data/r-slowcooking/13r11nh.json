Put it in, sprinkle dry onion flakes, and added broken up garlic cloves. Cooked on low for about 5 hrs. Then put on a cookie sheet, i smear BBQ sauce on half of them and broil all of them for about 7- 10 mins.",

If it were a recipe, i would have more details (like measurements) i would have it writen down, and it would be something i make the same exact way every time, ive never put apple cider vinegar in with my ribs before. \ud83d\ude01",

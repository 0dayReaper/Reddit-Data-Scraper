                                    "comment": "Making arepas is one of the simplest recipes you can possibly make. The corn meal is pre-cooked for these, it's called harina PAN (there are other brands, but PAN is the OG). So making the dough is as simple as hydrating it enough and then cooking it in a hot pan (thick, preferably, no teflon) coated with a thin layer of oil.\n\nI start with water first (some do it the other way around) with a bit of melted butter and salt in it, and start adding the corn meal in small amounts, making sure to dissolve lumps as I knead (and \"knead\" is a strong word for this, you can literally do it one handed, it's more like integrating the ingredients, there's no need to work the dough).\n\nOnce done, it should feel easy to shape, not runny (they will come apart and won't develop a crust), but not dry to the point it \"cracks\"  (they will feel heavy and too dry) when shaping it.\n\nAfter you shape the \"discs\", put them in a medium heat slightly oiled pan and leave them alone for a few minutes, not touching, sauteeing, moving, shaking, turning around to see how they're coming along, etc, just leave them for a bit to cook a crust, after a few minutes, flip, and do the other side.\n\nOriginally, you then put them in the oven, medium heat, to finish fluffling them up, but a lot of people skip this step as it is not strictly necessary.\n\nThat all sounds like I typed a lot, but once you get going, the dough takes 5 minutes, the cooking around 10 to 15 (half each side, depends on thickness of your discs). Serve very very hot, straight out the pan/oven, so any cheese will melt inside. Also, I'm of the opinion they need to have a ton of butter spread inside once opened.\n\nTry it for yourself, it might take a couple of goes, but it's literally so fast to make you will get the gist of it in a jiffy. And it's so forgiving you can literally adjust the recipe after the fact. They came out too soft? Add a dash of PAN and re-knead. Too hard and crumbly? Add a dash of water.\n\nThe fillings is a whole other world of flavor. Cheeses mostly (soft, not too aged, think fresh to sharp cheddar, gouda, emmental, edam, etc, nothing aged like parmesan or blues), ham slices (ham and cheese is a popular favourite), shredded beef, chicken \"salad\" (shredded chicken, mayo, some add potato and peas, etc).\n\nThen comes the mixing. Why not shredded beef with sharp cheddar? Chicken salad with avocado slices?\n\nHonestly go on youtube or something and search \"arepa fillings\", there's a whole world out there. This is the Venezuelan style by the way, we make them thicker and put all kinds of fillings inside. Colombian ones are very thin, and they incorporate stuff into the dough itself, but I don't like that.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve made a recipe for Mississippi pot roast that I got from Pinterest a few times now with no issues. \n\nToday I tried and the meat is fairly tough and in some parts is grey with congealed fat. There\u2019s no bad smell and in some parts it\u2019s still pretty tender.\n\n1. Is there any way to salvage this?\n\n2. Any ideas what could have gone wrong?\n\nFor reference - the roast is about 2.5 lbs and I cooked on high for 4ish hours. I did have it on warm for a little bit as well. \n\nTIA!",

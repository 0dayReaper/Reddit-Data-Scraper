    "postText": "When Im making bone broth ive found that higher temperatures tend to draw out the collagen more effectively, however using my gas cooker for 12 hour periods is offputting. Since slow-cookers dont tend to bold food (afaik), i was wondering if there are any models that do, perhaps there are some slow-cookers better designed for making bone broth than others? Any recommendations of suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks",

They are cheap, especially if you grab one around the holidays, and have a temp control that you can dial in for your particular environment.\n\nJust my 2\u00a2.",

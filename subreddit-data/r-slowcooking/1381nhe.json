    "postText": "Hey guys, dumb question. Have you found slow cooker recipes to be more cost efficient than cooking a meal every night? I just ordered my first crock pot and as a single guy who\u2019s struggling to pay bills, I\u2019ve heard that this can help save a few bucks, but since most recipes include larger cuts of meat and other ingredients, I\u2019m skeptical.",

            "comment": "It makes many portions at a time. I get a pork shoulder, make pulled pork, freeze some for later- make pulled pork tacos, pulled pork chilli by adding beans and canned tomatoes back into the crock pot to make another 12 meals. Excellent cheap protein.",

            "comment": "Yes, Jamie Oliver wrote a whole book about cooking a large piece of meat at the start of the week and repurposing it all week (or freezing the leftovers), and it's much less expensive than buying smaller, more tender cuts of meat for each indvidual dinner.  \n\n[https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/category/books/save-with-jamie/](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/category/books/save-with-jamie/)\n\nI'll braise a pork shoulder or beef roast and use it for tacos, sandwiches, pizzas, burritos, pasta, soup... \n\nA whole chicken gives bones for stock and meat for dinner, sandwiches, potpies, tacos, etc. \n\n A whole salmon for dinner then becomes salad, salmon burgers, patties, etc. \n\nMeatballs become sandwiches or pasta toppings.  Stew becomes a pot pie for its' next appearance.  Butter chicken sauce is butter chicken one night, chick pea curry the next.  \n\n Even if you just fix a recipe for 6 or 8 (soup, chili, stew, curry)  you can freeze the extra portions for a future meal.  If that stops you shopping or getting take out, it's a win.  \n\nIn addition, preparing dinner in the morning when you have the energy prevents you from coming home hungry after work and givingup and ordering out, which saves you money, too.  You can also run the slow cooker overnight, if thats more convenient for you. It's less energy and doesnt warm up your whole house like running the oven for hours a a time will.   \n\nThe trick is portioning - portion the meal out when you service it - one plate for you, five containers for the fridge or freezer.   Or, if you're me with myfamily of three, 3 servings now and the other half goes into the freezer immediately.   This stops you eating all of it in one sitting.",

Just invest in some individual-portion containers, and clear a little freezer space. Each week, pull out 1 of each of your 7 meals, and you\u2019ve got your lunch or dinner  cooked for every day. \n\nMake 14 meals, and you\u2019ve got lunch and dinner.",

It might seem more expensive at first till you have a freezer full of different stuff BUT in the long run it works out to less money less time cleaning up and if you cook say 2 days a week you have almost zero expense or cleanup the rest of the week so more time for things you like doing. And zero effort good for you hot food on nights you work late annd are tired!",

            "comment": "You can always cut down the recipe to a more manageable size. Or you can use the leftovers another day. Most things you can freeze to use the next week. Many things, you can make into something different for another day. Pulled pork for sandwiches becomes burrito filling or gets added to rice or made into gravy and served over noodles or potatoes, for example. If you refuse to eat leftovers and you are the only one eating, you may not save much money with the crockpot but also factor in the idea that if you know you have a hot, tasty dinner waiting for you at home, you are less likely to do an expensive fast food (or other) stop on the way\n\nGood luck.",

            "comment": "What it does is make it easier to cook the larger cuts of meat properly. Those cuts are usually cheaper. Chuck roast is half to a third the cost of a ribeye. Pork butts are fraction of a tenderloin, etc... Find some sort of neutral tasting recipes and make other dishes with the leftovers. Try the Kahlua pig first. It's basically pork and salt. The leftovers can top baked potatoes, go in omelets, make red beans and rice, tacos &amp; burritos etc.",

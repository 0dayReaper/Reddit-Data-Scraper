Basically a pound and a half of chicken thighs, tsp each of onion powder and garlic powder, 3 tbsp of honey, 1/2 tsp of cumin, and four canned chipotle chiles plus about 2 tbsp of the adobo sauce they\u2019re packed in, and 1 tsp salt. Throw it all together and slow cook for up to 5 hours, then add in a can of drained and rinsed black beans.",

Here you go \n\nIngredients \n1\u00bd pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n3 tablespoons honey\n1 teaspoon onion powder\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n\u00bd teaspoon ground cumin\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 to 4 chipotles from a can of chipotles in adobo, finely chopped, plus 2 tablespoons adobo sauce\n1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained\nJuice of 1 lime\nWarmed tortillas, for serving\nPickled onion, for serving (see Tip)\nSliced or cubed avocado, for serving\n\n\nPreparation \n\nStep 1\nCombine the chicken, honey, onion and garlic powders, cumin, salt and chipotle chiles and adobo sauce in a 5- to 8-quart slow cooker. Stir well. Cook for at least 3 hours and up to 5 hours on low. If it\u2019s more convenient, you can let the slow cooker switch to warm after 5 hours. The dish will hold on warm for about another 3 hours before the chicken starts to become quite dry.\nStep 2\nUsing two forks, coarsely shred the chicken in the sauce. Stir in the black beans and lime juice. Cover and let the beans warm through, about 5 minutes. Taste and add more salt or lime juice if necessary. Serve in tortillas with pickled onion and avocado.\nTip\nTo make quick-pickled onions, thinly slice a red onion and put the slices in a bowl or container. Bring about 1 1/2 cups cider or white vinegar to a boil, and add about 3 heaping spoonfuls of sugar and a big pinch of salt to dissolve. You can also add a pinch of red-pepper flakes, a bay leaf or some dried oregano, if you like. Pour the hot vinegar over the onions and let them cool. They\u2019re ready to use right away, and can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 weeks.",

Top with a little raw white onion and cilantro and put into a par-fried corn tortilla - frying your tortillas in a couple tablespoons of oil at a time for like 30 seconds a side helps strengthen the tortilla and adds more texture.

Go with some roasted salsa or anything else, really, that will have more flavor.",

Then piece into large chunks with two forks. The chunks should be about the size of 3 fingers \n\n*Set the liquid from crock pot aside - don't bother straining onion etc, it's super soft but do remove the orange.\n\n\u2b07\ufe0fTO CRISP \u2b07\ufe0f\n\n\u2022Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large pan over medium high heat. Place pork chunks in the pan, wait until the the bottom side is golden brown and crusty. Turn and just briefly sear the other side - you don't want to make it brown all over because then it's too crispy.\n\n\u2022Remove pork from pan. Place on paper towels. Repeat in batches (takes me 4 batches) - don't crowd the pan.\n\n\u2022Just before serving, drizzle some the left over juice from crock pot over the meat and serve hot.

This is an Instant Pot recipe, but you could adapt it to your crockpot easily, by searing first in a pan on the stove. I know many skip that step, but there is a difference and it makes the chicken tacos even better! https://youtu.be/WZeVs4ahbrc",

Salsa on top of it. Then right before you serve put a few cubes of cream cheese on top and put the lid back on to get it melty. Serve it over rice with a handful of tortillas.",

Add chicken thighs and some of the chipotle peppers on top (1 will be tasty, more will be spicier) . Pour in the salsa and cook for about 8 hours. When done, take out the chicken and shred.  Blend the remain liquid and add back the shredded chicken. Let it sit on warm in the slow cooker for 1/2 hour.\n\nThis is very easy and quick. If you want to take to the next level, pour everything into a pan and put on grill with applewood and let it smoke up till most of the liquid is dried. My friends and family go nuts over this but it does take about 12 hours to do. I start this at 7 or 8 am and have it ready for dinner. The meat can be used for tacos, sandwitches and may other meals. Since I make big batches, i freeze these in freezer bag and warm up before serving when i dont have time to cook or just lazy.",

It will taste way better to cook it first. \n\n1. oil in hot pan\n2. chopped onions and garlic in hot pan for two minutes\n3. add curry seasoning, stir for like 10-30 seconds\n4. add some water and stir around to make like a paste\n5. keep it hot and cook off that water until it sounds like it is sizzling again\n6. now use this delicious greasy cooked onion-garlic-spice mix as your flavour base and start whatever you are cooking with this stuff",

                                    "comment": "Exactly. The essential oils and other compounds in the curry seasoning need to be activated by heat, but they'll burn off if not heated in a fat that is good for high temperature. Vegetable oil will work fine and if you add ghee, coconut oil, or sesame oil to it (about 1/3 of the amount of vegetable oil), the curry essences will activate and bond with the oils/fats and won't burn.\n\nSame goes for adding heat (spice), like chili peppers (fresh or dried/flakes). Add the peppers to the oil after you've cooked the onion and garlic so the capsaicin and other essences start activating and bonding with the oil/fat, then add in the curry and follow the steps /u/teh_dumbest_man provided above. Lower the heat after step 5 so you don't burn the sugars and essences in the peppers and continue with cooking your dish!",

Is it really necessary to add about 1/3 of coconut oil or something to vegetable oil in order to activate and bond the curry essences? Coconut and sesame oils are expensive. Is it that it needs to be a polyunsaturated oil? Could I use probably-fake-cheap-Italian-olive-oil? \n\nI've been doing this because that's what family told me to do and it seems to work well. But mildly interested in the chemistry side at a 10th grade level.",

Coconut or sesame oil adds a nice flavor to the curry spices that round them out (and make it a tad closer to \"authentic\"), but you can do just fine with only vegetable oil. If you like and have polyunsaturated oil on hand, use that instead of the coconut or sesame oil. Just make sure it doesn't have a low smoke point, or else it may add an unpleasant \"burnt\" oil flavor if it's heated too high.\n\nYou could also make your own quick ghee for the small amount needed by melting unsalted butter on low heat until the liquid turns a clear, almost bright yellow, then skimming the foam and solids off the liquid (doing this with butter, called clarifying, can take a bit of time depending on the amount you're making, anywhere from 10-15 minutes up to an hour or more). Add that liquid butter directly to your curry spices and oil mix, or store it in a clean glass container, sealed, for up to a week in the fridge.\n\nYou can alternately freeze it in silicon ice-cube trays wrapped in plastic wrap with toothpicks stuck through the wrap into the center of each ghee cube, then pop them out individually from the tray and transfer the cube to your oil/spice mix by holding on to the toothpick (or any other dish you want to use ghee in) and sliding the cube off the end of it with fork tines. Frozen clarified butter will keep in the freezer 2-3 weeks in the ice-cube trays, or up to 2 months if you transfer the cubes to a sealed container.\n\nHope that answered your questions!\n\n* | edit |\nI forgot to clarify about the activation and bonding of the essential oils and flavors from the curry spices \u2014 they will activate and bond in and to any fat, really, and vegetable oil works well for this. Say you were to use entirely coconut oil for curry, or high smoke point olive oil and sesame oil together to make a dish using Mediterranean spice mix or a garam masala spice mix... the oils themselves will add a bit of flavors suitable to the spices and dish that just vegetable oil doesn't. So if you're able to use them, great, and if not and have to stick to vegetable oil, that's fine. It doesn't drastically change the chemistry of the essences and oils from the spices and aromatics cooked in the oil.",

I usually buy it in block form which already has added fat but you would need to stir fry it in oil to release the flavour and add some sort of stock to create the curry. After that just toss in browned meat, veggies and whatever and let it simmer together until everything is cooked. You can thicken with potato or other starches if too thin. \n\nI like beef and pork the best. I'd cut beef into chunks or use stewing beef if I'm letting it sit longer. With pork it's awesome to let full porkchops simmer in the curry, it's really flavourful. \n\n\n\nServe with side of veg, rice, noodles or even mashed potatoes, love the mash potatoes.",

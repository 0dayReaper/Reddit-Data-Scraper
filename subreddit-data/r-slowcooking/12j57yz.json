            "comment": "This was a play on the routine \"meat and 3 veg\" I had so often growing up and for the past 2\u00bd decades have shied away from. Thought I'd mix it up a bit for something different, yet keep the familiar look.\n\nStarted with a small Potato and 2 Carrots halved along with 2 cups of boiled water. Added 4 crushed Cloves of Garlic, a teaspoon of Celery Seed and a cup of finely chopped Coriander - I know this is usually added as a garnish due to it's delicacy but I prefer mine cooked similar to Spinach. Up to you on this one.\n\nI use a 1.5 litre (baby) Slow Cooker - it heats up fast due to it's small volume and only took about 95 minutes on high for it to be bubbling hard away. At this point I switched it to \"warm\" setting and removed the 6 pieces of vegetable. Out with the Pestle &amp; Mortar and mashed away - the Carrots did need a little further dicing to mush up. Mixed the then mash in a bowl and put to the side.\n\nNext - back to the Slow Cooker. The water had almost reduced to a cup, so perfect for adding a packet of Roast Chicken Gravy Mix Powder. I then grilled 100g of Eye Fillet Steak as well as steamed 200g of filleted Chicken Breast diced up. This was then placed in the Slow Cooker and stirred through, completing the 2 meat and gravy.\n\nFinally steamed half a trimmed Broccoli which then along with the Carrot &amp; Potato Mash was served on top of a bowl of the 2 Meat Gravy.\n\nA really nice &amp; healthy comfort food.",

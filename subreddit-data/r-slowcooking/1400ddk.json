    "postText": "Mississippi Pot Roast is a staple in my house. I make it at least once a month and I always make enough to have leftovers for days. It\u2019s such a simple, incredibly flavorful recipe that needs very little alteration.\n\nI\u2019ve made it in the slow cooker, braised it in the over, pressure cooked it in the instant pot, and the slow cooker has to be the best method I\u2019ve attempted.\n\nI\u2019ve tried adding potatoes and carrots in the pot during the last hour or two of cooking, I\u2019ve served it next to roasted veggies, sometimes I\u2019ll buy stuff to make sandwiches with the leftovers, but my favorite is serving it over a bed of mashed potatoes with a reduction sauce made from the cooking liquid. \n\nAfter playing around with the recipe, when I make it now I opt for the reduced sodium brown gravy mix instead of the au jus so it isn\u2019t as overwhelmingly salty (it\u2019s still plenty salty), and I add 10-15 peperoncini with a splash of the liquid on top of the meat before I top it with the butter and packet mixes. During the last hour of cooking, I\u2019ll remove about half of the cooking liquid, skim the fat off the top, and reduce it down until it coats the back of a spoon. \n\nI\u2019m making Mississippi Pot Roast for a family dinner tomorrow and I\u2019m curious to see if anyone has changed the recipe in such a way that they\u2019ll never make it any other way now.",

Then I put the shredded roast in the pan and crisp it up with a splash of Worcestershire sauce. I place a slice of cheese over the meat in the pan so it gets super mealty (Muenster or dill havarti) and put the cheesy roast on the toasted bread with raw, sauteed, or pickled red onion, mayo or mustard. Absolutely delicious.",

But, taking the advice of a friend, I turned the leftovers into french dip sliders and THAT was amazing! Reheated the meat in au jus from a packet. Put it on Hawaiian rolls and topped with provolone cheese. Put the tops to the rolls back on and slathered with melted butter and everything but the bagel seasoning. Cover with tin foil and bake at 350\u00b0 until cheese is melty then uncover just long enough that the tops get browned. Serve with the au jus to dip the sliders in. Soooo good!",

Takes one minute to prep. TBSP beef bouillon. TBSP corn starch. Tsp onion powder. Tsp parsley. A few cranks of pepper and a pinch of garlic powder. Hand mix or better, use a food processor.\n\nThese led to my mother-in-law declaring it was the best pot roast she'd had in her life.",

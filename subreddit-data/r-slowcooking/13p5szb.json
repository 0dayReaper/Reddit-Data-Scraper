    "postText": " So I have been trying a few different apps looking for this information and articles don't seem to address my issue exactly.\n\nDoes anybody know what the calories per oz/gram/etc. are in pork shoulder/butt if I cook it in a slow cooker and then drain the fat that renders out. This is pretty common practice for making pulled pork. I imagine it reduces the calories significantly but I don't know how to calculate that.\n\nThanks in advance.",

            "comment": "   Determine the initial calorie content: Look up the nutritional information for the raw pork shoulder/butt. This information typically provides the calorie content per serving size (usually per ounce or gram) for the uncooked meat.\n\n   Estimate fat loss: The fat that renders out during cooking can vary, but a rough estimate is that about 30-50% of the fat can be removed by draining. Keep in mind that this is an approximation, and the actual fat loss may vary.\n\n   Calculate adjusted calories: Subtract the estimated calories from fat that was drained from the initial calorie content. Multiply the fat loss percentage by the fat content in the raw meat to get an estimate of the fat calories that were removed. Then subtract this value from the initial calorie content.\n\nIt's important to note that this method provides a rough estimate, as fat content can vary between cuts of pork shoulder/butt. Additionally, cooking methods, seasoning, and other factors can influence the final calorie content. If you require precise calorie information, it's best to consult a professional dietitian or refer to a reputable source that provides specific data for cooked and drained pork shoulder/butt.",

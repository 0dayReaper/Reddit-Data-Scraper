Most people at least put a bed of onions on the bottom of the crock and the roast on top.  Here's what I do tho:  \nSear the roast on relatively high heat until you have a nice brown crust on all sides then add to crock pot.\nRub a tablespoon or two of AI (I use Bold and Spicy) on the top.  Then sprinkle a pack of Lipton Onion Soup mix on top of that.\nSmear a can of Cream of Mushroom soup on top, then LOAD the crock up with veggies.  Potatoes, carrots, celery, onions, mushrooms, whatever you like.  8 hours on high should be plenty.    \nIf you really want you can add a cup of chicken broth (add some Worcestershire and soy for umami) but it really shouldn't be needed.",

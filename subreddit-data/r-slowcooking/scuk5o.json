Depending on the mass of the food, the temperature the pot was at, and the temperature of the fridge, I personally have no problem risking that. I would be far more concerned with melting my plastic fridge shelves or something else in the fridge. \n\nOthers here have mentioned condensation being an issue for the electronics. Unless there's a lot of steam coming from the contents of the crock pot, or you out something else fresh in the fridge, this is also not a concern. Perhaps just don't plug it in immediately after you take it out- give it a few hours to warm up and dry before turning it on. \n\nThis is how my wife and I typically handle our leftovers.",

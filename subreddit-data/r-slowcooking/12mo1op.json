Essential elements seem to be : Soffrito, ground meat, white wine, 1 clove of garlic used for flavoring and removed, bay leaf.  \n\nBolognese, white or red, is an elegant sauce and I hope everyone gets to enjoy it.",

Add onion and carrot and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.\n\nStep 2Add lamb, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring to break up the meat, until no longer pink, about 3 minutes. Stir in broth, heavy cream and rosemary, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer, partly covered and stirring occasionally, until mixture is thickened, about 30 minutes. (The sauce may look broken at first, but it will emulsify as it cooks.) Discard the rosemary sprig.\n\nStep 3As the sauce cooks, make the pasta: Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water and drain the pasta.\n\nStep 4Over medium heat, add the peas and spinach to the sauce and stir until spinach is wilted. Add the cooked pasta, butter and \u00bd cup of the reserved pasta cooking water to the sauce. Toss vigorously until sauce is thickened and coats the pasta, about 2 minutes, adding more pasta water if a looser sauce is desired. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice, cheese and parsley. Season with salt and pepper.\n\nStep 5Divide pasta among bowls. Garnish with more cheese, parsley and black pepper.",

However on my grandfather\u2019s side they just called it a bolognese bianco since it\u2019s white wine based meat sauce. My grandmothers side called it a rag\u00fa. But she made something like this often when I was growing up. Not with the peas etc though. Bolognese falls under the rag\u00fa umbrella. Per my dad who is in Italy right now since he gives Italian tours based on food, regionally some areas just shorten it to Bolognese Bianco\u2026but yeah. It wouldn\u2019t be the traditional name for it.  You\u2019re right about that. But it\u2019s also not that far-fetched either. You can Google it and come up with plenty of results. Including from Italians. I can only go by what my own Italian family says. I don\u2019t claim to be an Italian food expert. However if you are Italian then you know there is a traditional Rag\u00fa all\u00e1 bolognese Bianco and you knew what the post had to do with bolognese even if the term may not have been used exactly in the correct way so what, you just wanted to make OP feel bad about their food photo and meal in a generic Slow Cooking sub? Makes zero sense. Anyway I\u2019ve also been lucky enough to live in Spain and France as well as Mexico and various countries in Central America. And worked in Uganda and Tanzania. One thing I\u2019ve learned for sure about food is that there are many regional variations of a dish and even regional names for similar foods. There usually isn\u2019t just one right answer.",

I save ends and skins from onions, carrots, garlic, ends of celery, cherry tomatoes and mushrooms just starting to turn, herbs you won't finish before they go bad, chicken bones and scraps, etc. When your bag is full, dump it into the crockpot, cover with water, add fresh thyme, red pepper flakes, a little kosher salt, peppercorns or fresh cracked pepper, bay leaves, and a glug of apple cider vinegar. Let it go for 24 hours or so. Strain through cheesecloth and voila. Excellent stock. I'm actually doing that this weekend bc I have a ton of scraps to use up!",

    "postText": "Hi, so I have 4 lambchops left over that were not cooked. I found a few slow-cook recipes that call for 8 lambchops along with other ingredients. If I were to half the recipe does that mean I should half the cooking time as well? I obviously want to make sure my dish is prepared safely but I also don't want to completely dry out the meat.\n\nThank you!",

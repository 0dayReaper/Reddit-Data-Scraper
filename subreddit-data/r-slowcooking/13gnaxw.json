    "postText": "I really thought I had lost my touch with slow cooking. I would cook 4-5 pound chuck roast and pork shoulder for 6 hours+ on low.  The meat was tough and I always wondered if there was too much liquid or did I over cook it.  I could never figure it out.\n\nFinally a few months ago, it was 8 o clock at night and my chuck roast had cooked for like 8 hours and it was tough.  I said f it and put it on warm and let it sit over night,  woke up at 7 am the next morning and it was perfect!\n\nSo now I just turn these roasts and big cuts on right before I go to bed around 10pm.  When I wake up I flip it over to warm and by 5pm at night it is absolutely tender and perfect.\n\nIf you are finding that your meat is tough.  Cook it longer.  I find that switching over to warm for 6-8+ hours after the initial cooking period helps make the meat fall off the bone tender!   And helps suck up all the juices in the meat.  Hope this helps someone who may be struggling with their slow cooker.",

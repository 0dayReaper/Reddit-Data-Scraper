I already have some store bought stuff a neighbor gave me but this is too good to throw away.  Besides chicken soup what are some good ideas for using this broth?  I'm up for anything.  It doesn't have to be tied to the chicken I'm making today.",

Also, use it for rice, as others have said. I also cook pasta in it when using much less liquid than a pot of water, and it's unreal.\n\nIf you ever get chicken pieces (thighs for example) use the broth to braise them on a deep skillet after adding a bit of brown to them with a pat of butter and seasonings and you'll get a fantastic base for gravies/sauces. It adds SO much richness to dairy-based pasta sauces in a good way. Also makes good grease for your potatoes when pan-frying or oven-roasting, or for mashing.\n\nEdit: also Gumbo and/or Jambalaya!",

Blend that up into a liquid, then heat and add in chicken broth (kinda eyeball it for consistency and flavor) and let that sucker go for like half an hour minimum. \n\nI will warn, a little tumeric goes a long way, so no more than half a teaspoon is needed, but the rest should be to taste. You can sub onion and garlic powder in a pinch, but fresh/jarred garlic and real onion is preferred. \n\nPrep your chicken (I use the braise method I mentioned btw as it prevents losing moisture and aids in shreddability), shred with a fork, put in half your sauce in with the chicken and mix. Wrap in tortillas (I recommend white corn personally, but yellow corn is also fine) and top with more sauce and shredded cheese. I bake it at like 375 until the cheese is melty and it looks a bit crispy on the edges. \n\nRecommend serving with spanish rice and beans. For soanish rice, toast 2 cups rice in a bit of oil, then add one can of tomato sauce and 4 cups chicken broth, salt to taste, and cook until rice is done.\n\nEdit: if braising your chicken, use the sauce as your braising liquid and add your chicken broth as needed. You want to almost submerge the thighs in liquid and let that liquid reduce until it coats the back of a spoon, thrning your chicken over every 20 minutes or so. Obv brown your chicken first. \n\nAlso, if time, effort, or cost is a concern, get a good-quality enchilada sauce from the store as your base and add your chicken broth, braise, and use as mentioned above. It won't be quite as good as if you made it from scratch, but it will be way better than storemade. Also, don't forget to salt your chicken before browning! I've messed that up and it reeeeeally sucks.\n\nSecond edit: use bone-in, skin on pieces. Boneless will not impart enough gelatin and fat into the sauce to help flavor it.",

Dont peel the onion or cut the celery, carrots, or pepperPour the drippings and everything into your pot. 2 gallons of water, salt, pepper, granulated onion n granulated garlic. Slow simmer for a good 12-18 hours. Keep covered at all times. When done, strain into a large bowl, strip the meat off the bones if you want. When it gets to room temp, freeze in small containers. Now you have a soup base. Or instead of adding water to pasta sauce, use this. Don't forget, chicken is a pretty neutral flavor, so you can use it in all types of meat dishes.",

Cover it and boil softly for at least 30 -  60 minutes.  Check to see if you need to replace any water.  I scoop out the hock, let it cool, and mince up what meat I can.  To the broth, I add sliced carrot, minced onion and garlic, let it cook 15 minutes.  Add potato chunks and bok choy stems.  Lastly, add bok choy greens and any smokey flavored meat.  The greens cook quickly, so put those in last.  If the soup needs more flavor, you can add soy sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, and seasoned salt or a touch of Old Bay Seasoning.  I finish cooking until the potato chunks are tender.",

    "postText": "My colleague recently lost a close family member very suddenly and I'd like to prepare a simple dish for them that is light and flavorful, but not too robust. You know how sometimes when you're upset food just disgusts you? I want to make them something they can eat if they feel like they don't want to but have to. Right now, I have a cabbage soup recipe that might be okay, but I'd like to hear some ideas. \n\nThanks all!",

I know some people enjoy soup when the weather is hot, but not everyone does.\n\nDon't worry about it being light, just flavorful and maybe even a little dense calorically for the very reason you gave: they might not be eating as much as they need to right now. So maybe go with something you feel is your best, most successfully prepared dish.",

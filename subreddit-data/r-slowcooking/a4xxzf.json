Gave it a hard sear in a hot griddle pan. \n\nAdded the vegetables to the slow cooker first, then the chuck roast, followed by about a cup and a half of beef broth, and a cup of red wine and just let it go for about 8-9 hrs. \n\nPulled everything out of the slow cooker, added some flour to the leftover juices and made some gravy to top everything off!

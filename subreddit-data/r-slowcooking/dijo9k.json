You can copy and paste recipe links into it and it will automatically populate all the fields correctly. It also has a multiplier just like what you\u2019ve made in Sheets. In the app you can also create a shopping list based on the recipe.\n\nBeen using it for years, highly recommended.",

I would have easily paid double and still felt like I got a great deal. \n\nIf you\u2019ve tried shopping list and/or recipe apps before and given up on them then please just give Paprika a chance. It\u2019s so easy to use and having all your recipes in the same clean format is so fucking nice. No more scrolling past paragraph after paragraph of food blog BS.",

It's in the recipe in 2 places, and for some reason when it adjusts to half it changes it to 1-14 oz can (listed twice), and then since its used twice it changes back to 2 -28 oz cans for the shopping list instead of being 1-28 oz can total or 2 14 oz cans. I guess all quantities in the recipe get halved, even if it makes it incorrect overall :/  \nEdit: I see that the numbers recognized by the app as a quantity become bold, so I fixed it by just adjusting the recipe to say \"2 cans 28 oz sauce\" instead, so only the \"2\" is recognized as an adjustable quantity for the recipe. Just something I have to be aware of I guess.",

You'll use maybe the 3% or 5% of the program, tops.  \n\nLots of community colleges and libraries hold 'Excel for Beginners' courses that are great, start from the very beginning, and will get you up and running. And they give you someone to ask direct questions to. What you'll find is that all of the extra, 'advanced' stuff are actually just shortcuts made to help you do things easier once you know they exist.",

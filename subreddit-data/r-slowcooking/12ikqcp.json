    "postText": "Looking for suggestions for how to slow cook a leg of lamb (on the bone) in such a way that I can get 3 or so different dishes out of it, to maximise cooking efficiency. There are just two of us and I'd freeze most of this.\n\nI already have some lamb tagine in the freezer from a previous cook a couple of months ago, and I have also already butchered off and cooked the top of this leg for a rare roast.\n\nI'm thinking something like - slow cook in red wine, garlic, thyme.\n\nTake some out after ~6 hours and serve up with lightly roasted potatoes, rocket, balsamic, fresh mint  a la a French bistro.\n\nPut some aside to freeze for gyros/tacos.\n\nCook the rest a bit longer as the base of a stew (the bone will be useful), perhaps with some nduja as a twist then atypical British/fresh stew ingredients and freeze.\n\nSuggestions welcome! Google is particularly light on suggestions for multiple dishes from one slow cook!",

Good way to use up leftover veg as well. \n\nOther than that, stick it in quesadillas, on top of homemade (or frozen) pizza for something a bit different or use it to bulk up sandwiches.",

(I put the meat in overnight with plenty of seasoning and maybe a drizzle of olive oil, cook on low for 12 hours and let it go cold. Id recommend not adding too much to it of you want multiple meals from it) \n1) chop the meat into cubes, fry over a high heat until the fat starts to render down.\n2) add garlic, ginger, chilli, soy sauce and Chinese 5 spice.\n3) add any veg you might like\n4) chuck in cold cooked rice, more soy sauce and adjust seasoning. Add an egg or two if you wish. Stir and heat really well. Eat.\nAlso, Shepherds Pie, Lamb samosa, twice-cooked lamb (similar to above) and some kind of pastry pie.",

There is no carving so you don\u2019t waste any meat and it gives you either a nice broth or liquid for gravy. \n\n[Slow roast leg of lamb - Oven version](https://www.recipetineats.com/slow-roast-leg-of-lamb/)\n\n[Slow cooker leg of lamb](https://www.recipetineats.com/slow-cooker-roast-lamb-leg/)\n\nBtw this website is amazing. \n\nWe had this with couscous, vegetables and some of the broth last night. \nThen portioned the rest and kept the broth for other dinners. \n\nWe are planning:\nGyros for lunch,\nShepherds pie - using broth,\nSpiced lamb and Persian rice  - using broth\n\nETA: I use this as my base lamb roast dinner recipe normally, just add all the trimmings. Wanted/needed beyond easy yesterday though, the couscous and veggies were spot on. \n\nYes, it takes a long time but it\u2019s worth it and setting and forgetting for 5 hours is a godsend.",

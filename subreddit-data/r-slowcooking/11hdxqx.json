    "postText": "[Recipe.](https://www.budgetbytes.com/slow-cooker-rosemary-garlic-beef-stew-slow-cooker/)\nI've tried many, many slow cooker recipes and this beef stew is absolutely fool proof.\n\nYou can add more or less of any ingredient and it still tastes great (except the stock, don't skimp on the boillion).\n\nI've subbed both carrots and potatoes for parsnips and turnips, beef for lamb, even swapped out regular flour for whatever weird crap we had in the pantry.\n\nThe main thing is you sear the meat and deglaze the pan with your liquids.\n\nI often do 1.5x the liquids/spices.\n\nGoes great over rice, with some toast or just as is. \n\nCheers.",

Slice the carrots and celery. Mince the garlic. Place the prepared vegetables in a four or five quart slow cooker.\n\nPlace the stew meat in a bowl and sprinkle the flour, salt, and pepper over top. Toss the meat until it's evenly coated in flour.\n\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high. Once very hot, add the cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface of the skillet. Add the stew meat and cook, without stirring, until browned on the bottom. Stir and then allow the beef to brown on a second side. Transfer the meat to the slow cooker.\n\nTurn the heat under the skillet down to medium-low. Add the broth, Dijon, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, rosemary, and thyme to the skillet. Stir and cook over medium-low until all the browned bits have dissolved off the bottom of the skillet.\n\nPour the broth over the ingredients in the slow cooker and everything a good stir.\n\nPlace the lid on the slow cooker and cook on HIGH for 4 hours or LOW for 8 hours.\n\nAfter cooking the meat and vegetables should both be tender. Stir the stew well to allow the potatoes to slightly break down and thicken the gravy. Taste the stew and adjust the salt or other seasonings to your liking. Serve hot!",

With this recipe and the techniques as a base, you can modify it as needed. You can also try adding tomato paste, wine or beer as well. I think once you've made it a few times you'll develop a good sense of how to modify the recipe to your taste and ingredients on hand.",

Boy, that was a fun sizzle. Then added in the rest of the broth and marinade ingredients. I had vegetable stock on hand and skimped a bit, using only about a cup. \n\nWhen it came time to add everything to the slow cooker, I added onions to the beef but held off on adding the potatoes and carrots until 4.5 hours later. When I did, I added in another cup of water/stock. \n\nEnd result - deep, long lasting, mouth watering, umami flavor. Veggies cooked for 3.5 hours or so and weren\u2019t too mushy so that was a plus for me. It\u2019s pretty thick as you\u2019d imagine given I went light on stock but the consistency is great. So excited for more tomorrow and to come back to this recipe again. Thanks!",

I sliced it into large steaks, salted and peppered, browned on both sides without the flour, cut into chunks and added to the vegetables. Never forget to pour all the accumulated juices from the plate/cutting board into the slow cooker! That's good flavor. I decreased the stock by about 1/2 cup and added a good glug of 2016 Barolo to the pan to deglaze the fond. Added garlic cloves whole instead of mincing. They will melt into the stew. Used fresh rosemary and thyme instead of dried. Added a good squirt of \ud83c\udf45 paste. I'd have preferred to put some whole pearl onions into the stew but my grocery store didn't have any, so I used frozen chopped onion (my go-to quick cheat). I'm looking forward to the finished stew already. Thinking about making some popovers to go with the stew. Maybe just crusty bread though.",

Mine usually are fully soft and ready to be put through the sieve after about 16-ish hours. Always use vinegar, to break down the bones. \n\nAnd I agree with another commenter that vegetables can make it not taste as good. I like the simplicity of my bone broth that is only the necks and backs, filtered water, salt, and vinegar.",

Sometimes I'll push it to 48, if I want a really rich broth.\n\nI also wait to add the vegetables. If they're in for too long, the broth develops bitter off flavours. I add them 4-6 hours before the end.\n\nI don't skim off the scum because I'm lazy, but it'll taste better if you do. If you don't, it dissolves back into the broth and also tastes off.",

You can then cook your vegetables and bones at the same rate. Putting in whole bones will take far longer to extract. I can make a solid broth with the carcass of a whole chicken chopped to bits, and some onion, carrot, celery, maybe some coriander seed and peppercorns for flavor in like.... 2 hours boiling or 6 hours on high in the slow cooker. When chop up the bones, it infuses so much faster. No reason to worry about bitter veggies.",

Then do a 5ish minute blanche in boiling water.  When you're doing your main boil for stock you get much less scum.  \n\nThis is similar to how they prepare meat for making ramen broth.",

Yes, it\u2019s easier to use than simmering a pot on the stove, but I have another suggestion\u2026bake your bone broth. There are lots of easy recipes online and I\u2019ve had much better results not using a crock pot. Just my 2 cents!",

I also threw in some carrots, celery, and kale to get some extra veggies and my family had no idea. \n\nMy only problem is that the tortellini fell apart on the second night. I wish I\u2019d followed my mom\u2019s rule from when I was growing up- always cook the noodles (for any soup) separately and store them separately and just add them to your bowl when it\u2019s time to dish up.\n\nEdit: I also added mushrooms and lots of garlic. The mushrooms are very much worth it!",

His instructions were \u201cuse the entire spice cabinet\u201d, I feel this instructions are very applicable to this soup as well. (Obviously not the whole spice cabinet, but rosemary, oregano, basil, garlic, pepper, red chili flakes, fennel seed, thyme are all great to start with. As with any seasoning, taste often and adjust as necessary.)",

    "postText": "UPDATE\u2014thanks for the comments! Decided to just buy a new one\u2014crockpots are relatively cheap and I\u2019m no electrician. Thanks for weighing in. :)\n\nTitle says it: I did a dumb thing tonight while trying to clean a bit of burnt food out of the exterior layer of my crockpot: I filled the bottom of it with soapy water for 3-4 minutes to soak. When the directions say not to submerge, I always figured as long as I kept the cord and controls out of water, I\u2019d be okay. But of course, water started seeping out the bottom of the container a couple minutes into the soak, and I spent the next fifteen minutes frantically scrubbing at it with paper towels to get water out of every crevice I could. \n\nSo, my question is: have I ruined it? What are the chances I barbecue myself next time I plug it in? Is there a way to totally deconstruct and put this thing back together to get every speck of water out, or is this a \u201cchuck it and buy a new slow cooker\u201d situation? \n\nThanks in advance. TLDR; don\u2019t clean your slow cooker when you\u2019re tired late at night and not thinking straight.",

Just let it dry out fully before using it again, I took the bottom off mine to make sure it was fully dry (the bottom was just a protector plate thing held on with 4 screws). If your house doesn't have surge protector built in (and I mean what houses these days don't?) then get a power strip with one to test it when it's dry. I didn't bother, mine has been scrubbed out that way multiple times and I just leave it to dry for a few days or so before using it again",

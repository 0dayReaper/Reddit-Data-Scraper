Let sit until the next day in fridge. \n\nBrown all sides in pan with extra chilli sauce and butter,\n\nCook for like 5 hours, take out, slice, add more juice to tri-tip steaks.\n\nHave yet to mess with it on pork, I do have a loin defrosting... but have had it on top of chicken and that works too.",

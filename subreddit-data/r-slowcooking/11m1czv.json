Right at the end I stuck a thermometer in the meat, st the bottom the temp was at 185 but closer to the top I was just getting 160.\n\nNot knowing what to do I just added on 4 hours on low. Is this right or is this done and I should unplug?",

I pulled out the bone and left the pork in the crock pot.\n\nNEW QUESTION: As I type this I have already set the pork back on HIGH and just pressed four hours. I don't know if my crock pot is losing power (it's 10 years old) or whatnot, but that will either give me dogmeat or finished product.",

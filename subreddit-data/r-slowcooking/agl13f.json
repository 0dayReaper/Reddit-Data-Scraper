I couldn\u2019t find any tandoori masala so I just put in half a teaspoon more of the garam masala. I\u2019ve often tried to make curry at home but this is the first one that tasted like it could have come from an Indian restaurant. Much recommended!",

The biggest hurdle is finding the right spices, and depending on where you are that may just mean a trip to the ethnic market or (like in the Reno area) down to the bulk food bins at WinCo. Most of the other ingredients are fairly common things like cream or yogurt or pureed tomatoes.",

Curry is generally prepared in a sauce. Curry dishes prepared in the southern states of India, where the word also originated, may be spiced with leaves from the curry tree.There are many varieties of dishes called 'curries'. For example, in original traditional cuisines, the precise selection of spices for each dish is a matter of national or regional cultural tradition, religious practice, and, to some extent, family preference.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Because that would be correct.  \n\nCurry powder was invented in Britain to \"approximate\" Indian cooking.  \n\nYou should ask him/her again sometime if he/she ever cooks curries.\n\nEdit - lol, and I mean.. I know Indian people who \"cook curries\" and use Indian cookbooks that talk about curries, so...?  Few of them use curry powder, though.",

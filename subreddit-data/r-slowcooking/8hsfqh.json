    "postText": "feel free to nix this but i feel like i'd rather see actual food than raw meat or whatever. it doesn't make me want a recipe, it doesn't look appetizing, just nothing. it's like one step forward from taking pictures of packaged meat at the grocery store. a lot of the time i'll go into these posts hoping to see what the finished product looks like so i can decide if it looks good enough to try it, and there won't be any mention of what it looks like when it's done. \n\nlike i said, feel free to shut me down if i'm being a jerk, but i feel like i'm not the only one who feels like this. i'm glad everyone's making cool stuff with their slowcookers but i feel like the sub would be improved if people posted their food when it's done rather than as soon as they put it in.\n\nedit: another thing -- if you post before it's done, we don't even know if your recipe is any good. it might look like it's going to be good, but if it turns out not being good and you regret posting it/recommending it to everyone on here, it's too late.",

Couple years ago, I had a roommate with one, and I tried to use it, but every time I made a beef dish, like stew beef or a roast, it ended up a dry, gross yuck.  And I was following recipes!  \n\nIt wasn't until I found this subreddit that I figured out putting it on LOW for around 8 hours, and adding little to no liquid does the trick.  Moreso, I could just coat the meat in seasonings that I like, rather than follow a recipe that calls for several things I'd have to buy, then never use again.  \n\nThat said, I wouldn't mind seeing advanced dishes like you described.  I'm oddly enough, snooty when it comes to spices and seasonings.  We've started growing rosemary, lavender, and basil, and have weaned myself off the prepackaged packets.  \n\n-----  \n\nPS: Forgot about this... the first rule of this sub makes its mission statement pretty clear:  \n\n**This subreddit is for \"Crock-Pot\u00ae\"-type recipes only.

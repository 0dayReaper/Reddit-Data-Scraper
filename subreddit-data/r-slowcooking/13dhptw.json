Slightly different flavor but still very good.\nI prefer a North Carolina barbecue which is a white sauce, a little bit vinegary but creamy.\nOr recipe is awesome and one that I know works well. Thanks for sharing it with us!",

It comes out nice and tender every time, falls apart as soon as you touch a fork to it.\nSeason with dry rub (I cheat and use McCormick Memphis BBQ dry rub packets) and cover in plastic wrap, let it sit for a few hours.\nHeat oven to 400\nSear all sides, top &amp; bottom, in a cast iron skillet.\nPop the pork butt in any kind of baking dish, I use the aluminum throw away pans for easy clean up. Cover with foil.\nPut it in the oven and drop heat down to 325, check it around 3 hours see how it\u2019s lookin, depending on size of course, then take the foil off. Bake for another hour or so and bam! It\u2019s done &amp; delicious!",

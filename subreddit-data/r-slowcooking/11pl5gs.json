Ground chicken? \n\nI'll let you know how it goes.",

It's really a bummer that's happening to you, and loving kindness thoughts to you this morning.\n\nIts so good she had an oatmeal book for you. She is very inventive with her vegan recipes especially in the slow cooker instant pot realm, and almost always gives oil free and gluten free options which even though I'm flexitarian is appreciated. \n\nKind and gentle regards to you",

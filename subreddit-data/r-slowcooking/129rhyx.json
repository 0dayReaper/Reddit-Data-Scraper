But be aware that it might cook faster (if it's in smaller chunks than the recipe called for) and depending on what ground chicken you buy it likely will contain more fat than just cubed chicken. You might want to consider buying chicken tenders or fingers. Just a few slices across each piece with almost any knife you have and you've got cubed chicken.",

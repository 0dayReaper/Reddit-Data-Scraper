But, for so many slow cooker recipes they are just as easy and taste much better if you just cook it the traditional way. It\u2019s usually not much more complicated, takes less time, and yields a better result. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the slow cooker comes in clutch from time to time, but I see so many recipes on here that would be so much better and quicker if you just made them on the stovetop and/or oven.",

It looks like the glaze has crawled away from the clay. It leaves the clay around these islands completely bare.\n\n There's a lot of reasons it could happen. The piece wasn't dusted off properly before being glazed, your hands were too oily or the glaze itself is mixed incorrectly. The glaze could also be too thick in the area. \n\nAn artist I know intentionally attempts to crawl her pieces cause it can look very cool. But it is also 100 percent not food safe.",

And slow cooker pasta casseroles!)  worked d you and your family and it was delicious then that is not a wrong way to cook them.\n\nIn other words never apologize for cooking something that works for you. The haters can go to r/shittyfoodporn and troll, you can eat amazing slow cooker fajitas and enjoy them. I'll know who's having the more enjoyable experience, and it won't be the \"you can't make that in a slow cooker\" troll police.",

Honestly it's right here in the about page, we are about crock pot type slow cooking. If people don't like seeing fajita mix done in a slow cooker, there are plenty of other subreddits for them to complain how slow cooker fajitas ruined Tex Mex food for them forever and/ or post their \"real fajitas on grill\" recipes for validation.Instead they troll here and make others afraid to post good slow cooker ideas.",

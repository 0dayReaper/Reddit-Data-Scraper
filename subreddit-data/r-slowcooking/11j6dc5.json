    "postText": "Has anyone ever made a loaf of bread from a \"boxed mix\" (such as banana nut, blueberry, orange cranberry) using their slow cooker?  If so, what size slow cooker do you use, how long, and what setting?  I would love to wake up to the smell of bread baking and enjoy a warm piece with my hot tea!  \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\ude0b\ud83e\uded0\ud83c\udf4c\u2615\ud83e\uded6.",

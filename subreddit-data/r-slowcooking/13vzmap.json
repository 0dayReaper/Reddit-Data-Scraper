I looked in on some chicken breasts with salsa that we are cooking right now and it's at what I would consider a hard boil.\n\nHow can I tell if my crockpot is cooking too hot?",

Cover and heat on Low for 8 hours. Lift lid and immediately check the water temperature with an accurate thermometer. The temperature should be 180 degrees \u2013 200 degrees. If the temperature is higher than 200 degrees, your food may overcook. If the temperature is lower than 180 degrees, you should discard the crock pot since your food will not reach a safe temperature quickly enough.",

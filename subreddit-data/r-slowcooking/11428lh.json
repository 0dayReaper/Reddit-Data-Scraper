Then veggies (large chunks) on top, really not in contact with the liquid. I cooked them for about 8-9 hours and the veggies were cooked well\u2026\nIf you don\u2019t put the veggies on top or they\u2019re submerged in liquid I find they cook in about 4 hours. Also veggies like potatoes or carrots are good for long cook times, if I\u2019m adding celery I find it\u2019s overdone if cooked for more than 3 hours.",

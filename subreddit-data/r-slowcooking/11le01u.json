And then bake. Depending on how many oranges you have you could make orange chicken. Or juice them. Mom makes hot Cinnamon apples using Cinnamon red hots candy. You could take the berries and some yogurt and blend that up and make Popsicles. Orange cream Popsicles also. I like to put a pork loin or any pork and potatoes in the crockpot add just enough water or broth to cover the meat and potatoes. Put apples cut up and Cinnamon and sugar in a foil packet. Place that right on top of the meat. So good apples and pork together.",

    "postText": "I love cooking corned beef in my slow cooker.  It is one of the easiest recipes for me and I've never made a bad batch.  I recently bought a roaster oven for SPD so I could make a larger batch for a party.  I've read I can emulate my slow cooker routine of cooking on low for 8 hours with veggies by setting it to around 200 for 8 hours.  That seems reasonable to me.  My question is do we need to add water to the very bottom of the roaster below the pan the food sits in if we are already adding beef broth to the pot?",

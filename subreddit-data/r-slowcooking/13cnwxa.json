I love it because I can sear my roast or saut\u00e9 my onions, and then turn the temp down and slow cook it. I got it only because my old large crock pot disappeared in a recent move and I realized it in the fall when everyone was buying slow cookers and I needed one that day. Went to 3 different stores and the only large one with a timer I could find was the Ninja Possible. More than I had planned on spending at that moment but I haven't regretted it.",

The Mississippi pot roast and this one (I forget what it's called, but people usually just refer to it as The Soup).  One of the first instructions is cutting up an onion and mixing with flour and other stuff in a bowl and microwaving it to start, which is absolutely weird to me.  Microwaving is not the same as actual cooking raw ingredients and will develop different flavors, but maybe those are what are key to the dish... I have no idea, I've never made it.",

Microwave for 5 minutes, stirring every 90 seconds or so. (The mixture will be pasty and look weird but don\u2019t worry it will all be okay in the end). Add the mixture to the slow cooker.\n\nAdd broth, tomatoes, chicken, salt and pepper to the slow cooker. Stir.\n\nCover and cook on LOW for 4-6 hours or on HIGH for 3-4 hours (or until chicken is very tender).\n\nRemove the lid use a fork to remove the chicken out of the slow cooker.  And add in tortellini and spinach, Parmesan cheese and warmed cream (cream should be warmed because it may cause curdling if added in cold).\n\nOn a cutting board, shred or cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. Add the chicken back into the slow cooker. Put the lid back on and cook on HIGH for about 10 more minutes, or until the tortellini are cooked through. Ladle into serving bowls and enjoy!",

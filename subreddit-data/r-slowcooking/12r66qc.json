(BNB ) I keep on hand all the BNB so it's either the chicken, veg or roasted garlic flavor plus pepper, maybe a herb or two like thyme and maybe a clove of smashed garlic. \n\nI pepper and herb up my chicken, put it in the slow cooker add the  liquid and soup base. 2 hours on low later = (Check at hour and hour half  mark for doneness like I get mine to 164ish f figure residual heat will get it across finish line 165 F. You want it sliceable not shredded so watch the time.\n\nLet it cool, slice or store for later \n\nAlso, broken record but I like Kathy Hester's Vegan slow cooking for two or just you. Healthy slow cooking is her blog.  I like vegan stuff but sometimes if she is using a hunk of seitan or soy curls for meat, I'll just use meat if I feel like that instead of seitan or jackfruit.  Her dessert recipes including cookies are good. Found it On Hoopla app.",

Mine's only a 1.5 litre size so often I only cook 1 portion of meat for myself. I also don't run a fridge so I can't keep excess perishables. Though I live only an 8 minute walk to a small supermarket, so that tends to help.",

You will probabiy have to reheat the meal before eating. I sometimes cook just meat like that and it makes it very tender. I do it when camping to save on fuel.",

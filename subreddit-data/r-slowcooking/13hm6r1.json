    "postText": "I received a CR051 multicooker from Crockpot as a gift. The inner pan is made out of aluminum with a non-stick coating. However, I can't seem to find any details as to what type of coating is used. Is this a ceramic coating or teflon coating? As I'm trying to reduce my exposure to Teflon, I'd like to know what this is made of before using to cook food for hours on end.\n\nThanks!",

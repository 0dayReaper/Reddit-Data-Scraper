I'm pretty sick right now and live alone so I was wondering if anyone had any good resources or tips for figuring out how to make such a small portion of soup in a crockpot this size?",

If you really want to cook something in a small pot you would use a small piece of chicken. Onion. Salt and pepper. Maybe seasoned salt instead. You could add a little lemon juice. A handful or two of chopped fresh, canned, or frozen veggies.  Water. Tomatoes have vitamin C which is good for immunity. \nI hope you feel better soon.",

If you're really sick, that's all you need. \n \nNo cream of soup? Add some chicken stock. Or a cup of water and a pack of dried soup mix or gravy mix.\n \nIf you don't want creamy, you can add a cup or so of enchilada sauce, salsa, or marinara.\n \nThe chicken will add its own juices.",

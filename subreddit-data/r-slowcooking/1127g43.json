I haven't had venison roast recently, but if I recall correctly, my mother would always have to cook it much longer than a beef roast because of the lean meat. \n\nAlso also, the blog post recipe says 8 *minutes* instead of 8 *hours*. \ud83e\udd23\n\nThanks again!",

I grew up on game; my dad was the son of an allegheny mountain gunsmith and an avid hunter. He used to butcher and process his own deer, and made wonderful venison sausage by either adding lard, or mixing it with very fatty ground pork.\n\nEdit: Lard has gotten a bad rap in recent years. It's not great for you, but some foods fried in lard are out of this world delicious. I used to get little fried pies from some Amish ladies, pressed on a hundred year old mould and fried in lard, that were hands down the best pie I've ever tasted. And if you ever have a chance to try doughnuts fried in lard, don't pass it up!",

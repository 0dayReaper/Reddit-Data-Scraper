They use ground beef instead of sausage and there's no cream of anything involved. When he's killing himself at work and no one seems to notice, I'll make this for him and his world seems to brighten a bit. I'm not a fan of the dip, but I'm my husband's biggest fan--I don't even apologize when company finds my Velveeta stash in the pantry.",

I kept adding water until it was a shaggy sticky dough, but it \u201cfelt like bread\u201d then I added enough rolled it into a ball and kneaded it until it wasn\u2019t lumpy. I covered it, set it aside and waited to see if anything happened. It rose!\n\nI knocked the dough down again, kneaded it until it felt soft, and then rolled it into a ball, put it on dome cornmeal in a little cast iron skillet, slit a design in the top and set it aside to rise a little again under a big mixing bowl.\n\nI preheated my oven to 400\u00b0F. \nWhen the oven was hot and the dough had some lift to it, I put the pan in the oven.\n\nI immediately turned the oven down to just below 300. I know this is ridiculous, but I take my bread it out when it smells *really* good.  Smelling good isn\u2019t enough. *Really* good is when it\u2019s done. I guess it was about 45 min -1 hour. My daughter says my nose says bread is done at 190\u00b0 in the middle, but I don\u2019t have a food thermometer.\n\nIt was great, and even better toasted. I\u2019m going to make it again\u2014 \ud83e\udd1e . My neighbor said she wanted the recipe, but all I have is the jumble I just told you. Try it! It was a surprise discovery. Maybe you can improve upon it.",

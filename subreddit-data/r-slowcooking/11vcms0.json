Another option would be to prep everything the night before and keep it in the fridge (meat, veg, seasonings etc in the slow cooker, liquid separate). Then add the liquid and turn it on right before you leave the house in the morning, as all the ingredients will be cold they will take longer to start cooking which will buy you more time \ud83d\ude42",

I cooked for four hours on high, adding the lentils in the final hour. Once the chicken was just cooked/still tender I removed it to roughly chop/shred. Then added it back to the slow cooker until we were ready to eat. \n\nNext time I\u2019ll double the recipe to make a bigger batch. I also make an easy Mexican chicken with the same method using salsa and kidney beans instead of satay/coconut milk  \ud83d\ude42",

No additional cooking method, eg broiling or baking, is available. \n\nAny ideas?\n\nWhite or dark, whole or pieces, boneless or bone in, doesn't matter. Can add root vegetables, herbs and spices, but no gluten, rice or legumes. Size is 7 qt.",

Absolutely not.  \n\nYou also have to worry about evaporation.  Eventually all moisture will escape and then you'll end up with a ruined meal and a potentially ruined crockpot when it starts burning.\n\nI know some people who have done 18 hour chilli or homemade pasta sauce that have been fine, but they aren't cooking the entire dish at 18 hours.  Usually just the sauce, spices and ground beef, adding other stuff later on.",

            "comment": "Slow-cooking chicken for 18 hours can be a challenge, as chicken typically cooks faster and can become overcooked or dry with extended cooking times. However, you can try using larger, bone-in, and skin-on chicken pieces, which can better withstand longer cooking times without drying out.\r  \n\r  \nTo ensure food safety, it's essential to monitor the internal temperature of the chicken using a reliable thermometer. The chicken should reach an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to be safe to eat.\r  \n\r  \nFor an 18-hour slow cooker chicken recipe, consider the following:\r  \n\r  \n1. Choose larger chicken pieces, such as whole legs or thighs, with bones and skin.\r  \n2. Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and your preferred herbs and spices.\r  \n3. Add a flavorful liquid to the slow cooker (e.g., chicken broth, tomato sauce) to keep the chicken moist and tender.\r  \n4. Add hearty vegetables like carrots, potatoes, or onions to the slow cooker for a complete meal.\r  \n5. Cook the chicken on low for 18 hours.\r  \nKeep in mind that the texture may be different from traditional slow-cooked chicken recipes due to the extended cooking time. Be sure to use a reliable thermometer like [ChefsTemp](https://www.chefstemp.com/) to ensure the chicken is cooked to a safe temperature. Good luck, and happy cooking!",

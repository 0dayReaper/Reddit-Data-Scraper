            "comment": "Most Indian non-veg curries work really well in the slow cooker. Pick a recipe and go for it. Add less water than the stovetop recipe calls for, though, because there won\u2019t be as much evaporation. Oh, pick a tomato-based gravy rather than yogurt or coconut milk based - both of those will likely curdle with long exposure to heat.\n\nIf doing chicken, use chicken drumsticks and thighs - they\u2019ll stay juicier, whereas chicken breast tends to dry out.\n\nKeep in mind that you\u2019ll need less cooking time for chicken - if you leave it in the crockpot for 6-8 hours, the meat will fall apart.\n\nVegetarian curries tend not to do as well - the veggies become mush. Dals would work - mush is often the expected consistency.\n\nI also regularly use my slow cooker to combine/replace the overnight-soak-then-pressure-cook step for dry chickpeas for chhole/chana masala with perfect results, way better than starting with canned chickpeas. Note: if you add a tea bag to the slow cooker as called for in some chhole recipes, you\u2019ll permanently stain the insert - my formerly white insert is proof of that.",

I was hoping to cook some sort of spinach heavy curry since I love spinach. Or would it be ok if I used a tomato base?  \n\n\nDal looks delicious! I'll have to find a spicy recipe of it to try. Do you have any personal favorite recipes of any Indian dishes?",

                            "comment": "Spinach cooks so fast, though \u2026 I mean, why convert a [10 minute recipe](https://youtu.be/sZ2iTx20jWU) to a hours long process?  What I often do, though, is make a kheema (very similar to chili, minus the beans), and add in chopped spinach for the last little bit of cooking time. Of course, I have also been known to add minced mushrooms to my kheema and no one can tell the difference. And \u2026 kheema cooks so fast on the stovetop that I don\u2019t usually bother doing it in a slow cooker.\n\nAs for specific favourites - the whole pantheon. I was born and brought up in India, and love all the regional cuisines. Too many to pick a favourite, really.\n\nNo, wait. Beef curries.Those would be great in a slow cooker \u2026 just slow cooked stews. The long slow cooking will help break down the fibres and you\u2019re left with a melt in the mouth curry. \n\nIf you\u2019re up for seriously spicy, try making a Kerala beef peralan. Follow any traditional recipe off YouTube, just cook it long and slow in the crockpot. And then break out extra garnishes to really take it a step further: my most fancy variant included fried onions (deep brown!), fried peanuts, french fries and then I topped it off with wedges of hard boiled eggs. Toasted coconut chips or even toasted desiccated coconut is yet another favourite topping/mix-in.\n\nServe hot with rice or freshly made rotis/parathas/whatever. I prefer this with rotis or lacchha parathas, but others feel this is a perfect accompaniment for rice.",

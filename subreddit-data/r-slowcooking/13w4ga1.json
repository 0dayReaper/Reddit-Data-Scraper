            "comment": "Yes I promise there is chicken under there! I kind of threw this together but highly recommend. I also only cook for two people so some of the measurements are a bit weird but you can always double :)\n\n- 2 chicken breasts\n- 1/2 can of chopped artichoke hearts\n- 1/2 jar marinated sun dried tomatoes\n- A few handfuls spinach (I used frozen chopped)\n- 2 cloves garlic\n- Onion powder\n- Italian seasoning\n- Salt and pepper\n- Olive oil (maybe 1 tbsp)\n- A splash of balsamic or red wine vinegar\n\nThrow everything into the crock but the spinach and the vinegar. Cook on low for 2-4 hours or until the chicken is cooked through. Add spinach and vinegar in the last 10 minutes. Optionally top with feta or Parmesan cheese (highly recommend!). I served over rice but quinoa would be equally good\n\nETA: my slow cooker runs hot so the heat/time might be lower than what other folks need. Cook on high or for a longer amount of time if needed! I always recommend checking your chicken with a thermometer before eating",

Made a 6-lb pork butt last night in under two hours, start to finish, which fed ten people (and we had leftovers).\n\nWe've also made [The Soup](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=%22the%20soup%22) in it.\n\nDooo iiiiiit.",

I cook rice with it all the time, which takes about 20 minutes from turning it on to it being done, and slow cooking has been no issue either. The only downside I found is that when I slow-cooked things to eat with rice, I had to make the rice in something else!",

I added 200ml of coconut cream and some extra broth which submitted everything.\n\n\nBut now it\u2019s all watery, about 3 hours in. If it doesn\u2019t reduce, will adding flour near the end wreck the taste?\n\nEDIT: thank you everyone, you're all so helpful! I took u/Conwonthedon187 and others' advice to let it simmer for a while with the lid off, and that did the trick. I was worried when it looked all soupy but it turned out wonderfully.",

The downside is the darker it is the less fluid it holds on to.\n\nI've been known to make a batch and about halfway through cooking I take about half out as the thickener and leave the other half in so that I get the wonderful flavor.\n\nIngredients.... Equal parts oil (not butter!) And flour.",

You probably wouldn't need more than half a cup of flour whisked with cold water, make sure the mix isnt too thick more on the thin side before whisking it in slowly. Stop when you have the right consistency and simply simmer on low for 10 minutes while whisking it so it doesn't stick to the bottom of your pan and then serve. The flour imparts no noticeable flavor so you should be fine. I don't use cornstarch because for some people the flavor it gives food can be unpleasant.",

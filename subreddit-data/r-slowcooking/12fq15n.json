Just set it and go, when back home just turn crock back on to heat it up and mash (if applicable) and would be a great use for leftover easter ham (even with whatever flavors might be in the ham). Everybody remember that \"better than bullion\" is high in sodium/salt, so be mindful to have a good taste at the end before adding additional salt. Im sure the OP would agree you could just use (unsalted) boxed stock and salt well to taste at the end.",

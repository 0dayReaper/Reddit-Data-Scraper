I'd add the following steps\n\n1) Soak the red beans in the crockpot overnight in enough water to cover, then dump water in the morning\n2) Sweat the Trinity (Celery, Onions, Bellpepper) in a little bit of oil on low heat on the stove for about 15 mins\n3) get a good sear on the sausage before you put it in, it allows the sausage to hold up better and gives you some natural smokiness. \n\nThe other stuff - initial water put in, spices, how much you smash the beans on the side to thicken it is all personal preference. But I find the 3 steps above to be key.\n\nIts a great recipe and glad you found it!",

When you come home from work everything is ready to eat. \n\nIn other words, it's not about using all of the tips and tricks to make the best meal, it's about making an easy weeknight meal that's anywhere between acceptable and good. Dumping everything in the crockpot accomplishes that goal. cooking in batches like you suggest does not. It accomplishes a completely different goal, it gives the most flavourful dish possible.",

Opt for a hot smoked snausage as well, I use Double D. Trust me, you won\u2019t need any Cajun seasoning. Vigo Chicken base instead of the beef boullion. Couple twists of cracked black pepper and salt. Slow cook for minimum 11-12 hours. Cool then place in fridge for a whole day. Then stir cold and you will have creamy red beans, thick consistency, and no need to mash\u2026\u2026 and the flavor will be amazing!\n\nEdit: I soak my beans 1-2 days in the fridge as well.",

Skim the scum and strain the rest. Use this for your \u201cwater\u201d in the crockpot.\n\nOr\u2026\n\n2. Buy a ham bone from honey baked hams (if you have one nearby. Cut away a good bit of the ham and reserve. Use this bone instead of the ham hock in option #1 above. With an hour so left before finished, add the ham for another flavor and texture element.\n\nEnjoy!",

My 3 kids (ages 8,4 and 9 months)devoured it! \nI added the extra steps of pre boiling the beans before adding them to my IP, and sauteing everything. 2 pot dish (rice cooker and IP) definitely going into our rotation of dishes.

One thing to note is the time may be different depending on the size of the meatballs you make.  Had to leave mine in for an extra 45 min to be throughly cooked.  Next time ill try and make them smaller.",

Like, a pot of pasta on the stovetop can go from al dente to mush in two minutes; a tray of nachos under the broiler can go from cheerfully brown to charcoal in just a few seconds.  This kind of ruination will not happen in the slowcooker. \n\nThe cook time on the recipe says 2-2.5 hours.  I would bet money that if you left them in for four or five hours, they would still be perfectly fine.\n\nAs you get started slowcooking, my advice would be to follow the recipes when and where you can.  As you gain experience, you will surely have incidents where you don't get home as early as you think you will and your food will spend more time in the slowcooker.  Doing this, you'll get a sense for how forgiving it really is.\n\nPersonal note: I've been slowcooking for YEARS.  I've made a few dishes where I've thought, \"Man, this chicken got a little soft, shoulda taken it out a couple hours ago,\" but I've only really ruined one thing.  It was a lamb carne adovada without a lot of liquid in the cooker.  I put it in on high.  It was New Year's Eve; I thought I would go over to my friend's for an early drink or two and a board game, then head home before the ball dropped.  Flash forward to 6:00am and I stumble in to discover it had totally turned to charcoal and smelled like burning.  It would have been done after 3 hours but was in for about 9 hours.",

What I would do is open the slowcooker and gently stir the meatballs after about 1.5 hours, and then open the cooker again and get a test meatball in another 45 mins to an hour.  My guess is that it will be done.\n\nMy rule of thumb usually is if I open up the cooker expecting something to be done and it's NOT done, to close it again for an hour then check again.  But I think the 30 meatballs will all be done after 2.5 hrs.  Good luck, I hope they're tasty!",

Also, how long do I keep it in the pan, like when do I know to take it out?",

Tomatoes bound for the supermarket are picked green or with just a tiny hint of pink on them, and are gassed with Ethylene en-route, or in a warehouse before distribution. This causes the tomatoes to turn \"ripe\" but it really only changes the colour and causes them to soften a little bit. The texture it typically mealy to slightly crunchy and nowhere near the texture of a vine ripened tomato at the height of the season. \n\nThe only exception to this, I've found, is cherry tomatoes. They're pretty decent all year round, though still pale in comparison to a vine ripened cherry tomato. Incidentally, cherry tomatoes are dead easy to grow in pots during the summer, and I suggest doing that if you can.\n\nCanned tomatoes, on the other hand, are picked at the height of ripeness. They're fully red, or almost fully red, and are only shipped a short distance to a packing plant, where they are washed and are either blanched and peeled (for things like crushed, chopped, pureed or sauce) or left whole and sent to packing. They're stuck into cans, the acidity is modified a bit to inhibit microbial growth, and then they are pasteurized (the only really harsh step, which does alter the flavour a bit). From what I've been told, a lot of the processing plants have a tomato from vine to final product, with the flavour locked in in as little as a few hours.\n\nSo yes, canned tomatoes are better than fresh tomatoes for making sauces *most* of the year. If you can find fresh tomatoes at a farmers market, and they're in season and they've only been off the plant a few days, then you should use those. Or just eat them and used the canned stuff for sauce, since it's almost sauce anyways.",

Combine in sauce pan over medium heat. Season with things like garlic powder, onion powder, \"Italian seasonings\", salt pepper. I personally like red pepper flakes and sometimes I'll add cinnamon or smoked paprika for depth of flavor. Sometimes I saute fresh green peppers and onions and add them. At this point you can add red wine also. Either way you want to cover and simmer for at least 30 min. You want the sauce to thicken up and let all the flavors marry. Taste regularly to make sure you balanced your seasonings. Hope that helps! It's really easy and I haven't bought a jar of tomato sauce since I discovered it. ",

Add anything else you feel like you want in there!\n\nThat's like telling an aspiring pilot, \"just get in the plane and take it down the runway and take off. Then land when you get there.\" Or telling an aspiring painter, \"just mix some colors together until it makes the one you want, then apply to the canvas.\" Well what the fuck am I supposed to do with that?!?",

I know what spiced I do like (and don't), so understanding the rules behind what makes stuff work, made a huge difference.  \n \nI think for those of us who are very analytical, it can be a struggle.  Now, after a few years, I understand when its safe to sub something different and when you really have to stick to the recipe.  Spices and oils are pretty easy to swap around, flours are not (for example). \n \nI've shared this chemistry thing with another friend who HATES to cook and its helped him start doing a bit at home.

With my luck I'll get the meatball recipe down to a science but fuck the whole thing up by using the wrong tomato sauce. \n\nSo if anyone could provide us with an answer, I'd really appreciate it. Would something like a jar of Prego work? Just the run of the mill tomato sauce that you would throw on some spaghetti? Is there something else that's better? I guess what I'm asking is what kind of tomato sauce (aside from homemade) should I use and how much? \n\nThis recipe looks delicious and fairly easy to make, I just don't want to blow it by using too much/the wrong tomato sauce.\n\nLove your username, by the way. It's quite enigmatic. \n\nEdit: I also totally understand that cooking is an art which means you most certainly don't have to follow recipes exactly and that creativity can often lead to amazing dishes. The problem though, like any art, is that sort of creativity is born out of experience, practice, and, most importantly, confidence! If those of us new to this lack that confidence then we lack the fundamental tool required to be creative and experiment in the first place. Once we've gotten the rules down *then* we can break them. \n\nSure, I'd love to just go nuts in my kitchen by throwing in a bunch of random spices and completely improvise a dish but 9 times out of 10 it just ends up tasting like bullshit. So please, help us new guys out by pointing us in the right direction. Once we get the hang of it then we can start to get creative. Building off of /u/Jah_Ith_Ber's example, I wouldn't hand a guitar to someone and tell him to just pluck away and enjoy himself. At the very least he should know how to position his fingers on the fretboard and have a basic idea of how to tune it, otherwise he's just going to get frustrated and be severely limited in his ability to play.",

If you think you'll want it on noodles you may want to get an extra jar or make a little extra. I'd say that you shouldn't be afraid to just use your favorite pre-made sauce, though, because it definitely tasted fine to us. If you want to try and tackle making your own that's also awesome, but there's nothing wrong with starting in your comfort zone.\n\nAlso, we followed the suggestions from others and browned the meatballs in a pan first, and that was definitely a good idea. Also also, definitely consider using leaner hamburger--we used the (much cheaper) 20% fat one, and that was probably a mistake. There was a lot of liquid at the end and I'm pretty sure most is going to be fat. On the positive side, I suppose, that also helped stretch the sauce out more than it would have otherwise...",

Don't try to use frozen meat, and maybe mix near a sink with a bit of warm water running so you can warm your hands up or wash them between adding ingredients. To mix it spread your fingers out as far as you can, set your hands down on top of the meat then kind of scoop and squeeze your fingers up into a fist motion.  And repeat many times.  ",

I'll take note of the spices used, and based on what I have on hand and the approximate proportions from the recipe (ex - \"about equal amounts of nutmeg, cloves, and ginger, and about twice as much cinnamon as any one of those\"), improvise like that. \nAnd definitely taste things while you're cooking, as much as you can.

This type of low-moisture mozzarella tends to stick together and resist blending into anything.  \n\nI'm thinking next time I might try making the cheese/meatballs much bigger, which would increase the cheese/meat ratio.  Also, because mozzarella is kinda bland, having a much larger cheese center will be more dramatic of an effect.  This would probably be unwieldy for pasta applications, but would probably be great as a finger food for individual meatball sandwiches.  \n\nMine was pretty salty as well.  Therefore I under-salted the water when I cooked my pasta, to balance things out.  Next time I'll probably halve the salt.  (I wonder if the issue is that the amount of salt in the sausage mix isn't consistent from source to source?)",

If I bake them and then put them in the pot, will I overcook them or in some way mess them up?\n\nI apologize if this is a silly question.

Considering that the sausage has a higher fat content, you'll want to use a leaner beef (85/15 or 90/10).

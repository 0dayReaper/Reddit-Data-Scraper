Cook down any trimmings heavily in the pan first (cast iron is great for this!) and use all leftover beef grease to Sautee your mushrooms (thick cut) &amp; onion. Add the wine the last couple minutes and some parsley with a bit of garlic.\n\nLots of folks use a cream of mushroom soup, I recommend the tomato paste, broth, paprika, and wine route. Add sour cream at the end, use thyme, rosemary, garlic, and fresh cracked pepper. Over spaetzle or thick noodles is delicious! \n\nCan't remember my exact recipe, so I usually combine two recipes. \n\nA word of advice from a Hungarian friend: spice with paprika as much as you can handle, sharp and sweet. \n\nThe last batch I made was exquisite! My girlfriend told me it was exceptional compared to previous batches, she is particular about flavor.",

I only cook 2lbs for like an hour so you will need to figure out time. When it is fall apart tender you remove the meat and use corn starch to thicken the gravy.

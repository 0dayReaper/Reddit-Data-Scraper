The problem is there's no conclusive link yet to how microplastics are harmful to us, ergo the FDA has nothing to firmly latch onto in order to ban shit like this.\n\nBut the leading research/theory that's out there should be enough to steer people away from these liners.\n\nBut even if you're happy to roll the dice on your own health, there's still the environmental impact of this unnecessary garbage.",

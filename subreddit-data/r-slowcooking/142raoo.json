    "postText": "I posted a VERY American recipe here recently (Swiss Chicken) and there was some discussion in the comments about replacing some of the ingredients that are easier to find in the states (Stovetop stuffing mix/etc). \n\nIt made me curious: Do you all have any slow cooker recipes to share that are distinctly not American in origin? Maybe ones that may not be that popular outside of your country? Even outside of the area you live in your country?\n\nMost ones I find online or that get popular online are also from the US, so I'd love to expand past that a bit.",

Not if you don\u2019t want to pay lots extra for buying stuff online. \n\nIt would be fun to learn about what others do with their slowcooker. I\u2019m still new to it and haven\u2019t really dared to experiment yet.",

I have a slowcooker and an instant pot and found that (most) of the recipes are interchangeable, as long as you keep in mind that slow cooking requires more liquid. There are online converters for cooking times! I found Mississippi pot roast (with sucadelapjes) and the infamous \u201cthe soup\u201d  (with dried ravioli) really easy to make, pork or chicken with ketjap and classic stoofvlees are also fail proof :)",

I already have the Irish stew typed out in Dutch, I\u2019ll have a look later if I can post the other recipes as well. \n\nSlowcooker Ierse stoofpot\n\n- 2 uien, grof gesneden\n- 1 tenen knoflook, geperst of gesneden\n- 1 eetlepel bloem\n- 500-700g rundvlees: riblap of runderlap\n- 100g kleine worteltjes\n- 100-200g aardappel, in grove stukken\n- 1 koolraap, in stukken gesneden (of koolrabi, of vergelijkbare knol)\n- 300-500ml bier (liefst stout)\n- 2 runderbouillonblokjes\n- 1/2 theelepel msg\n- 2 laurierblaadjes\n- boter\n- ovenbroodjes / stokbrood\n\n1. Doe de aardappel, koolraap en wortel in de slowcooker.\n2. Bak de ui in een grote koekenpan met olie en boter tot glazig en zacht - ongeveer 15 minuten.\n3. Voeg de knoflook toe en bak tot die gaar is, en doe dan het ui-knoflook mengsel bovenop de groenten in de slowcooker.\n4. Verdeel het bloem over de lappen rundvlees zodat die helemaal gecoat zijn, en doe er wat zout en peper op. Bak het rundvlees in de koekenpan waar eerst de ui in is gebakken - voeg zonodig nog wat boter toe. Bak tot het rundvlees rondom mooi bruin is.\n5. Doe het vlees plus de laurierblaadjes op de groenten in de slowcooker.\n6. (optioneel: d\u00e9glacer) Doe een scheutje water in de koekenpan, laat dat nog even borrelen en schraap de stukjes aangekoekte ui/vlees van de bodem terwijl je roert. Als alles los is gekomen giet je dit erbij in de slowcooker: extra smaak in het eten plus de pan is makkelijker schoon te maken straks.\n7.  Kruimel de runderbouillonblokjes in de slowcooker, strooi de msg erover, en giet dan het bier eroverheen. Voeg eventueel nog kokend water toe tot het vlees net onder water staat - niet te veel.\n8. Kook 6-9 uur op de lage stand. De laatste paar uur kan je het ook zonder deksel laten pruttelen zodat de stoofpot extra indikt.\n9. Serveer met stokbrood oid\n\n\n\nbron: https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/11lyfhz/traditional_irish_stew_with_guinness/",

A stick is a US customary measurement that is not commonly defined.\n\nbeing told 'throw in three sticks of butter' without knowing that a stick is a set measurement was baffling for years. \n\nWithout context I was thinking the recipe authors just use a shitload of butter, the french do, maybe its just how it goes, it seems like a lot when I'm dealing with 250g 'sticks'.\n\nIt's akin to being told 'two cups' without the concept of cup measures. Tea cups? Coffee cups? A glass? Around here beers are sold in different measures with different names per state. How much is a middy and a schooner without looking it up? Which state is the pub in? Cups are also odd cause theyre volume, not mass. But some are, 250ml in Au vs 240ml in US for example. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup\\_(unit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_(unit)).\n\nJust to make it more wild, I have an north indian byriani recipe that calls for 1 teacup of yoghurt. And I have no idea how big a north indian teacup is, so I'm just gonna guess. I'm sure I could find one/out in this global society, but its gonna be pretty uncommon in my region.",

It doesn't necessarily have to be a strictly slow cooker made meal is what I'm getting at :)\n\nWhat I like to do is write the general name of something I'd like to make (say \"beef stew\" for example) then translate it into whatever language the country speaks, and google that. Doing it this way, I find that I get actual, regional results from that country and not some North American take on it which often dumbs down the spices and stuff for an assumptive ease of making it. I do this especially for Asian (Thai, Indonesian, Philipino, etc) food. The English speaking world seems inundated with recipe blogs where they try to make their take unique to the point that it barely resembles the dish it was \"based on\" originally.",

Then I tried translating it, and the first result was in a forum (not a recipe blog) and it was literally exactly what I had.\n\nThen I immediately did the same with an Indonesian kebab I had eaten every year at an annual fair throughout my childhood, until the Indonesian lady stopped setting up her tent. After a little research, I found it and it is so close to the original I actually got quite emotional when I took the first bite hahaha (I had been searching for nearly 20 years for a recipe before I figured out the translation idea)\n\nSo yea, I go to google, write what I'm looking for in English and translate it to say, Tagalog (Phillipine language). Then I take that and google that, sometimes you'll need to add whatever country you're searching for. But then I use the google translate extension to translate the whole page and read it in English that way. Usually I have an idea of what region/type of cuisine I'm looking for, just because it helps narrow it down, but you can always try searching in all sorts of other regions, too! \n\nAnother tip is to use the country's domain extension in subsequent searches for instance .mx for Mexico, .id for Indonesia. That *really* makes your results regional!",

We would do penny sliced sausage links, a half pound of beans, and then whatever veggies needed to be eaten. Usually it was tomatillos, carrots, celery, potato, onion, garlic, and S&amp;P with jalapeno sausage, pinto beans, and chicken broth for the liquid, low for 8 hours and I would add paprika, cumin, oregano, and some other seasonings halfway through/toward the end of cooking. You can serve it with whatever you want and it was always super yummy regardless of what beans you used.",

Of course every family has their own recipe and we\u2019ve adapted it to our own tastes (less meat) but this is the recipe I use.\n\n- 500g green split peas\n- 1 small celeriac, cubed\n- 1 big winter carrot, sliced or 150g baby carrots\n- 1 leek, finely chopped\n- 1-2 potatoes, cubed\n- 2-4 stalks of celery, sliced\n- 1 cube of chicken stock\n- 2 bay leafs\n- Some salt\n- Approx. 1.75 liters of boiling water\n- 1 big rookworst (dutch smoked sausage) or 2 small cooked sausages of choice, in thick slices \n\nPut everything but the sausage in the slowcooker. Cook on low for 6-9 hours. Remove the bay leafs and add the sausage at the end to warm through.\n\nIt should be a very thick consistency where all the vegetables are mostly mush and have dissolved. If they are too solid for your liking or you want to reduce cooking time you can use a \u2018stamper\u2019 to mash them before adding the sausage.\nIn our household (and many others) it should be so thick that a spoon can stand upright in it, but you can just water it down with water or stock if you want it more fluid. \nIt tastes best if you let it sit (in the fridge) and reheat + eat it the next day. Only then will it be called snert and not just pea soup.",

Throw all the ingredients aside from half the cilantro in the crock pot until the chicken is easily shredded. Toss the other half of the cilantro with the shredded chicken. I'm pescatarian and no longer eat land meat, but chicken tinga is good in tacos, burritos, quesodillas, and even sandwiches! If you want to bulk it up a bit you can throw in a can of diced tomatoes and one 4 oz can fire roasted green chiles.\n\n\n\nCoconut curry butternut squash soup - Throw an onion, a skinned and cubed butternut squash, 3 peeled medium-large carrots, 1 medium sweet potato skinned and cubed, 2 garlic cloves, 1 cup vegetable broth or stock, 1/2 tablespoon curry powder, 1 teaspoon cumin, and 2 tablespooons rice wine in the crock pot. Once the vegetables are so soft they're falling apart, add 1 can lite coconut milk and blend until smooth. Salt and pepper to taste. The soup is good on its own but I like to serve it with a crab melt sandwich. Nice crusty sourdough bread, lump crab meat, and your choice of cheese. My go-tos are smoked cheddar, extra sharp white cheddar, horseradish cheddar, or Swiss.\n\n\n\n[Red](https://natashaskitchen.com/classic-russian-borscht-recipe/) or [white borscht](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021711-white-borscht) is always good.\n\n\n\n\nPork chili verde - 2 lbs boneless pork shoulder, 8 tomatillos chopped, 1 onion julienned, 1 jalape\u00f1os with seeds and stems removed finely chopped, 2 garlic cloves finely chopped, 2 teaspoons chili powder, 1 teaspoon cumin (or more to taste), two 4 oz cans fire roasted green chiles, 1/4 cup fresh cilantro finely chopped and split in half, salt and pepper to taste. If you're a fan of spicy, cayenne pepper and/or red chile flakes goes well with this dish. Cook until pork pulls apart, toss in the remaining cilantro. This is good on tacos, burritos, quesodillas, or served with a side of Spanish rice and seasoned black beans.\n\n\n\n\n[Butter chicken or tofu](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016754-butter-chicken)\n\n\n\n\nThere are SO many good soup and stew crock pot recipes. Italian wedding soup, tomato or lobster bisque, bacon and corn chowder, tortilla soup, vegetable soup, lentil soup, split pea with ham soup, chili, minestrone, chicken coconut curry soup, french onion soup - the possibilities are endless!",

Brown the chicken thighs on both sides, then transfer them to the crockpot.\n\nIn the same skillet, add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Saut\u00e9 until the onion turns soft and translucent.\n\nAdd ground cumin, coriander, paprika, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, black pepper, and cayenne pepper to the skillet. \n\nStir well to coat the onions and garlic with the spices. Cook for another minute or until fragrant.\n\nTransfer the onion and spice mixture to the crockpot, placing it over the chicken thighs.\n\nAdd the preserved lemon, green olives, diced tomatoes, and chicken broth to the crockpot. Gently stir to combine the ingredients.\n\nCover the crockpot and cook on low heat for 6-8 hours or on high heat for 3-4 hours, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through.\n\nAdjust the seasoning with salt, if needed.\n\nServe the Moroccan Chicken Tagine over couscous or steamed rice, garnished with fresh cilantro leaves.\n\nThis aromatic and exotic dish will fill your kitchen with delightful flavors as it slowly cooks in the crockpot. Enjoy the rich combination of spices, tangy preserved lemon, and tender chicken in this Moroccan-inspired Tagine recipe!",

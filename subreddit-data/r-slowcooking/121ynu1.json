            "comment": "The preparation on this can be a bit time consuming.  It usually takes me a little over an hour to include making the roux.    \n\n\nI am using a 6 qt Crock Pot with two 12 oz packages of Andouille sausage, about 1.5 pounds of chicken, 1 pound of large shrimp, 3 bell peppers, 3 celery sticks, a 12 oz package of fresh okra, a large sweet onion, and a quart of chicken stock.  \n\n\nWe'll start off the dark roux by mixing together equal parts fat (bacon) and flour in a skillet.  Melt down the fat at a low temperature.  While the fat is heating up chop up a large onion and set aside.  After mixing in the flour you'll need to stir the roux constantly to avoid burning it.  When all the lumps have been stirred out of the flour then increase the heat.  If it begins to smoke too much then take the skillet off the heat, but keep stirring it.\n\nOnce the roux has finished and turns into a nice brown color then add in the onion.  Stir the onion and try to soak up as much of the roux as possible.  When the onions are cooked then transfer them to the Crock Pot.\n\nCut up the chicken and season with salt and pepper.  Add it to the same skillet you made the roux in and use some red wine to help deglaze the pan.  There's probably some of the roux left over that can be soaked into the chicken.  After the chicken has been seared on the outside transfer it to the Crock Pot.\n\nSlice up the sausage and optionally brown in the skillet.\n\nAdd in the celery, peppers, and okra to the Crock Pot.  You can optionally add in a jalapeno for added spice but I found that the andouille sausage in the slow cooker provides more than enough heat.\n\nPour in the chicken stock then add in some minced garlic, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and basil.  The chicken has been salted and the sausage contains plenty of salt so I don't add anymore.\n\nSet it on low and close the lid for 6 hours.  \n\nThe last step is to add in the shrimp.  You want to add it in at the end to avoid overcooking it.  The shrimp take less than 10 minutes to cook.  You can add in pre-cooked shrimp but I usually buy raw shrimp that's already been deveined.  I thaw in water, remove the shells, then add them in.  After the shrimp has been cooked I turn the slow cooker off and remove the lid.  I like to let it cool down a bit while I cook the rice before serving.  Enjoy!",

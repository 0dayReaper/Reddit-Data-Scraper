    "postText": "Unforunately I didn't have any spinach on hand, but otherwise it was really nice. Sliced chicken breasts cooked for 6 hrs in chicken stock (stock mainly removed afterwards), then added fried onions, pesto, and par-cooked pasta then let the pasta cook fully and added grated parmesan at the end just to melt it. It was nice, I'd have it again. It was really cheap too. I didn't use enough pesto as you can probably tell. \n\n[Chicken Pesto Pasta](https://preview.redd.it/6eigdqf9uh3b1.jpg?width=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=98d03bacfa548592d74eabf619b718f62cd5777f)",

You may be able to do it with raw pasta I'm not sure, but I boiled it for half the recommended time just to soften the pasta a bit (it still had a bit of crunch in the middle) before throwing it in the slow cooker. I know the rule is don't open the lid, but in the last 30 mins all your slow cooking should be pretty done anyhow. So I'd recommend checking the texture every 10 minutes or so because some people like their pasta al dente, and others prefer soft and gooey.",

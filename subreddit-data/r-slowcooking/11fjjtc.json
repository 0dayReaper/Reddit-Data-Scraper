Shred the leftover brisket nicely, mix with diced potatoes and some onion, season with black pepper and garlic. Whisk maybe 6 eggs, 1/4 cup sour cream, and maybe a splash of milk. Put the meat, potato, and onion mix in a casserole dish, pour egg mixture over, stir gently, just to coat everything really. Top with shredded cheese, one block of mild cheddar will do, or your choice of cheese. Bake at 375 for 20ish minutes.\n\nEdit: I am shooting from the hip on this one, I came up with this idea on the fly and have no clue if a corned beef breakfast casserole would work.",

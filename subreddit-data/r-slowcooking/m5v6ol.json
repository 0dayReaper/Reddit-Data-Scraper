Mix thoroughly until potatoes are coated evenly with oil and seasoning. Pour into air fryer and cook on high for roughly 25 minutes or until Golden brown, shaking to mix every 7 minutes or so. The same recipe can be done in an oven on a baking sheet. Using oven roasted garlic though, brings it up several notches and I highly recommend if you have an extra 35 minutes.",

And why we call it a pint of cream, or here (in ireland) if a pint is good it will be called creamy, even if you suggested to someone to go for a pint of creamers, I'm sure they'd understand.\nSandwich looks boss BTW, American portions, here our andwiches sometimes will have one slice of meat, on first arriving in the u.

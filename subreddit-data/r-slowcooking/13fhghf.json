    "postText": "I'm new to slow cooking and in the process of 'converting' existing stove-top dishes to slow cooker ones.\n\nOne in particular is a chickpea and spinach curry. I use a store-bought jar of curry sauce for this; when cooking on the stove, I throw in the sauce and pour in drained canned chickpeas and let it simmer till soft. Then, I add spinach leaves. Initially on adding, the spinach leaves will pile much higher than the sauce within the pot. However it quickly wilts and, with lots of stirring, gets fully mixed into the curry.\n\nWhen converting to a slow cooker, I see no issue with the chickpea simmering bit. However, will the spinach turn out okay if I just toss them in and leave it be for several hours? Will they wilt sufficiently or end up getting burnt?\n\nI know that you aren't meant to constantly lift the slow cooker lid, so stirring isn't a feasible solution unlike on the stove. Adding more water isn't feasible either, as this curry isn't meant as a 'liquidy' curry, more like a thick gravy surrounding ingredients, so it will only dilute the sauce.\n\nAppreciate any advice from anyone who's previously had a similar situation!",

So you don't need to submerge things in liquid.\n\nWith spinach, I would add it close to the end and, perhaps, just stir it in whatever liquid there is at that point. I wouldn't stir it again, except maybe at the very end of cooking.",

Canned Red kidney beans and Lentils I do the same. Takes a bit longer, in fact I'm trying to get hold of a new Colander. Would really be useful for this, even things like noodles etc",

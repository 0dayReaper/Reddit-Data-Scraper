Wash leaves well and pull the individual green leaf part away from its  main vein.\n\n(Note: Grocery stores  sell them shredded in bags but don\u2019t get those. They leave in the woody stem. Buy it whole in bundles.) \n\nThe thick part of the vein tastes woody - so nope.\n\nCook leaf pieces in chicken broth and water until soft. Old South types add fatty pork meat (ham hock or fatback) but it is too greasy for this New South person and probably for most new to collards as a side dish. Drain leaves and mash a little out liquid from leaves.\n\nHERE IS THE SECRET: Put pieces of bacon in a skillet (like cast iron) and add bacon bits to fry for the rendered fat to add flavoring. As bacon pieces brown, add cooked collards, stir. This skillet step removes soggyness. I have a round metal chopper thing and I give it a little more chopping. Leaves aren\u2019t supposed to be in hunks but easy to eat with a fork.\n\nAs collards reheat, I add salt if needed, and vinegar. My family topped their collards with chopped onions, or with pickle relish. Some like a shake of hot sauce.",

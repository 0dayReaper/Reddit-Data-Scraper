I have loads of recipes that can be made just from what I have on hand.\n\nI also meal plan for the month, which helps me plan my groceries and allows me to buy in bulk. I buy 8lb ground beef, bag it 1 lb at a time and roll it flag in the ziplock to freeze. Same with chicken breasts and thighs, although I don\u2019t roll them. I do eventually want to buy a food saver but that\u2019s a little out of budget right now.\n\nI try to have ground beef, pork loin, chicken, kielbasa, and loose sausage (sweet or chorizo) in the freezer at all times.\n\nThen in the pantry I stock canned veggies, pasta, instant potatoes, Mac &amp; cheese. Hamburger helper, soups. Stock, etc. so I can always have something on hand\n\nChest freezer and pantry get stocked monthly with my Sam\u2019s Club trip and then my weekly grocery runs are typically special items, bread, fresh fruits and veggies, and dairy.\n\nWith food prices the way they are, a nice pantry is a hedge against hardship. You don\u2019t have to buy it all at once either- stretch your weekly grocery buy to include some non perishables like canned goods, pasta, rice, etc. a little at a time and you\u2019ll fill it quickly. Most of that stuff is also WIC or SNAP eligible.",

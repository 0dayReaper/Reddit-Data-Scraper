I\u2019ve tried to manage cutting the ingredients in half, but I can\u2019t seem to get the right cook times. \n\nI have a small family. They also don\u2019t eat leftovers unless the world is expected to come to an end, so I refuse to buy a larger unit. I eat the leftovers, but there are only so many days one person can eat the same thing!",

I found Kathy Hester's Slow Cooking for two or just you to be a slow cooking cookbook miracle. \n\nEverything from meal prep like big batch caramelized onions in slow cooker to cookies and brownies. I am flexitarian so if I don't want to go vegan or vegetarian I don't. If she calls for seitan, or tofu, I'll use chicken or pork and do like wise for with her vegan dairy suggestions. \n\nBut most of her recipes make enough for three hearty portions or 1 portion with enough for lunch next one to do days.\n\nHighly recommend.",

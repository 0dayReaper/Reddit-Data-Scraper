You can just throw in extra potatoes and carrots as well.\nAnother thing that make a big difference is buying better beef stock. You don\u2019t have to go super fancy but spending an extra dollar or two makes the whole thing a lot better. \n\nThe final thing is, as others said. It takes a long time. Basically every beef chuck recipe I\u2019ve ever seen has underestimated the time, sometimes you need double what they suggest or more to get a good result so if you\u2019re following the recipe exactly this may be the issue. Pot roast is designed for cheap cuts like chuck roast so that shouldn\u2019t be an issue unless you\u2019re buying extremely sketchy back-alley beef or something",

Searing before cooking makes the juices slightly more flavorful but you can skip if you want. Season as you like, I usually do salt, pepper, 5-6 garlic cloves chopped, 1 large onion sliced, 3 sprigs thyme, 1 sprig rosemary, 1 tsp worcestershire sauce, and perhaps a can of chopped tomatoes or a cup of red wine (the acid helps break down the meat). I often add carrots, celery (cut in large chunks), and whole baby potatoes, then add beef stock till barely covered. Cook 8 hours on low. If you want to add mushrooms, do so in the last hour of cooking. If you want the beef to stay together instead of shredding try at the 6 hour mark.",

One of the fundamentals of peasant cooking\u2014 utilizing carrot, onion, and celery in combination. I like to saut\u00e9 the carrots and celery with garlic and rosemary for a few minutes before dumping them into chicken broth so they get a nice firm but soft texture. The onions can just go in raw. It\u2019s easy to buy a super market rotisserie chicken and strip it down, put the meat in the fridge and put the chicken bones in a metal strainer, and submerge them in a pot with more then enough water to cover them and boil until reduced to a light golden fatty stock. Add real chicken powder stock, salt, thyme, cracked pepper (white and red peppercorns together are very good), and water to taste, then add vegetables and chicken. Boil for at least an hour, until the onions are soft anyways. Meat soups taste better the longer the ingredients get to hang out, so I like to keep the soup hot for at least 4 hours before I actually eat it. If you do this, make sure to bring it back up to boiling for a few minutes, serve it, then put it away in the fridge. This is also amazing with parsnips in it! also try leeks, other herbs, or new potatoes",

It's kind of thick and pasty. If you add cream or milk it becomes a bechamel sauce, one of the four mother sauces in French cooking, from which you can make all kinds of other sauces. Once you add pretty much anything to it, it's no longer called a roux, though.\n\nYou don't use a roux as the base for chicken soup \u2014 at least not for any chicken soup I've eaten. Roux in a soup or stew thickens the end product, and chicken soup tends to have a thin, clear broth.\n\nYou *might* be looking for the word mirepoix, which is the name for the trio of carrots, celery, and onions (and/or leeks), often (but not always) precooked low and slow in butter or oil and used as a base and flavoring for stocks, broths, and soups. That doesn't make much sense in the context of that sentence, but it does in the larger context of the paragraph.",

If you are roasting a ham for Easter put a cup of water in the bottom of the roasting pan under the ham (I put my ham on a rack rack so the water doesn't touch it directly).  Then cover the ham with the roasting pan's lid or with foil. Make sure it's a tight seal so the water doesn't evaporate. As the ham roasts the water will steam over the ham and mix with the ham juices and create a great stock. Pour it in a large bowl and refrigerate so the fat can consolidate on top and be removed. Now you've got both ham stock and ham fat you can put in the freezer and use for cooking things like beans, greens etc.",

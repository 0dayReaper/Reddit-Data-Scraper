    "postText": "First time trying this out. Got a lamb leg at Costco and just threw it in on low with some spices and a little bit of broth. The thing basically tuned into a soup.. the meats still one solid chunk and actually really tasty but the liquid almost covers it now. I trimmed the fat off but is the rest of the liquid basically just a broth? It seems pretty gelatinous. I\u2019m fine with it being a soup I just don\u2019t wanna drink something too fatty.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s gelatinous from the bone. It will give the broth a rich flavor and feel. Since slow cookers don\u2019t allow steam to escape you add little if any liquid. You can pour most of that stock off and use or freeze it and continue to cook the lamb as you planned or you can just let it become a rich lamb stew. Yummmmm.",

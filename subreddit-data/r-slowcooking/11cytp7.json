    "postText": "I have broken off one of the rubber feet from my slow cooker. This is the third one I have done that to over the years.  Well, the second I\u2019ve done. I had help with the third. \ud83d\ude1c  It happens when I carry it in my car. I try to slide it on the carpeting and the foot catches and breaks, leaving part inside. The cooker still works fine but I have to keep track of that little rubber piece to put under it each time. \n\nHas anyone else had this happen?  Has anyone found a glue that will work to reattach it?  I\u2019m worried about the glue being safe with the heat it is subjected to. \n\nThanks.",

It\u2019s so awkward, especially when full and heavy. My only concern with using cardboard is that it might slip around on it.\n\nEdit: I see now you suggested putting it into a cardboard box, not setting it on cardboard. That would eliminate slipping. Maybe I can find a low sided box that I can set the box in the car then put the cooker inside of it. That could work!  Thanks again.",

Lots of different products come in them and all sorts or shapes. They are terrible for actually toting anything home in but work great for transporting a crockpot! I use them to take mine to potluck all the time and you can just discard and get a new one if you do have a spill. They are extra heavy cardboard. You don't even need a membership to walk in the back way \"need to talk to customer service about a membership\" then just walking up to where they have all the discarded boxes to grab",

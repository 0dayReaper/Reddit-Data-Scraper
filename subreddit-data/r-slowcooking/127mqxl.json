Also, their support does respond to email through their [contact us page](https://hamiltonbeach.com/customer-service) if you don't want to listen to hold music. It's possible that the inserts for all the 6 quarts slow cookers are similar enough that a lid from another model could work, but I would ask them before buying one.",

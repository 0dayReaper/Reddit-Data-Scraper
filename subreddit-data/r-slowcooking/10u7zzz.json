    "postText": "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/204424/stephs-zesty-sweet-and-sour-meatballs/\n\nI stumbled upon this recipe and it says to cook the meatballs on the stove first. What's the point of then adding them to the slow cooker if they are pretty much done on the stove ? Does this seem like a crappy recipe to you ?",

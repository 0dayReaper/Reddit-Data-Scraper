            "comment": "As I\u2019ve admitted, I\u2019m not Jewish. I heard about cholent for the first time in a book I read not too long ago. I had to look it up, and once I did, I knew I wanted to try to make it, because it looked so incredibly delicious. Since then, I\u2019ve kept noticing other references to cholent, most recently this article on Wikipedia, which cites it as the dish that inspired the invention of one of the first electric slow cookers. \n\n[This](https://toriavey.com/cholent/) is the recipe I followed to make it. Out of respect for tradition, I cooked it on a Friday. Jewish slow-cooking fans out there, I hope I\u2019ve done alright \ud83d\udc9b",

            "comment": "I love slow cooking. I do it often and in a variety of different ways. However, only one of these ways is considered acceptable on this sub. \n\nRecently, a comment I left on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/10ti3zt/correct_recipes_for_slowcookers_a_discussion/j77a2gp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) directly led to mods changing the description of this sub. I was under the impression that this was an inclusive space; they have made it more exclusive. \n\nLimiting the definition of \u201cslow cooking\u201d to crockpot-style slow cooker recipes is a very Westernized concept and disregards the many diverse forms of slow cooking that can be found around the world. It also ignores history, as slow cooking existed long before electricity did. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to see when the mods take action or chime in on this sub and when they don\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen people who were frustrated with the high amount of posts featuring The Soup and Mississippi Pot Roast, and asked for designated days and/or flairs for posting these. No comment from mods. I\u2019ve suggested flairs for non-crockpot slow cooking recipes and mods were completely dismissive, directing me to other subs instead. Yet when it\u2019s pointed out that the definition of slow cooking doesn\u2019t meet their definition of it, they change the description of the sub\u2026and don\u2019t bother to alert the community. \n\nI enjoyed this sub, especially finding new recipes and sharing my own. I shared recipes I made both in my crockpot and my Dutch oven, and for the latter, I made sure to include crockpot variations. (Mods apparently never had a problem with this, so again, it\u2019s interesting when and how they choose to get involved.) But it seems such recipes will no longer be acceptable on this sub. \n\nIt\u2019s disappointing that the mods here take a narrow definition of slow cooking, and that they disregard both the history that led to mainstream slow cooking as we know it today, and the diverse methods still used to slow cook in many cultures. For that reason, I\u2019ve decided that I will no longer participate in this sub. To the rest of you, I hope that you continue to explore slow cooking, and that all of your cooking experiences are educational and enjoyable. \ud83d\udc9b",

The dinnerlady in her kindergarten was of Jewish descent and made this for the kids, my mum fell in love with it. She still makes it today and I make it too. We don't put potatoes in it tho, I feel it has enough carbs in it as it is :D",

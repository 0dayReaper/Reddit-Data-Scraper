Pulled pork in a wrap or on a bun is nice but some variety wouldn't hurt.\n\nEdit: specifically big batch stuff I can prepare many servings of in advance. In a crock pot. I start work early and don't want to fuss about or assemble anything in the morning.",

Per cold soups like vichyssoise and cucumber with a vegetable hummus wrap or sandwich. The potato soup and dried chickpeas are made in my slow cooker.\n\nOr I make bean and grain like farro, barley or wheatberry salads with cold soups, or savory smoothies. I'll take a vichyssoise like base and drop some spinach in it. I make my beans except kidney beans from dried in my slow cooker. Yes, yes, I *know* it takes 30 seconds in an instant pot but if I'm not there to release it right away they turn to mush. Okay for hummus or soup purees but sometimes I just want a whole bean.\n\nI don't soak my dried chickpeas or other beans,  I just drop about a a cup of dried beans in the insert, add about 3-4 cups cold water. If making straight hummus and I care, I'll put about 1/4to 1/2 tsp baking soda in it so  the outer chickpea skin falls off. Most time though I'm batch cooking beans so I don't do this. Cook on high about two- 3 hours. Always comes out perfect. \n\nAlso,  I've made frittatas or savory bread puddings without meat in my slow cooker. Most of the time that can be eaten room temp.",

Stew, Curry and chilli are usualy gotos for me along with pasta bakes/lasagna when I batch cook each week for work\n\nChilli/Curry if made a bit thicker also makes a great wrap filling by itself or mixed with rice, especially if you're considering pulled pork anyway.\nCold baked pasta isn't that dissimilar to a pasta salad anyway And can be nice with some leafy greens or veggies\n\nGranted some people do have to so some major mental gymnastics to consider eating things cold, and some just can't face it which is fair. Never been an issue for me, mind you I also eat this stuff for breakfast at work as I'm a postal worker and it's a good filling meal to see me through to the end of my shift.\n \n\nSpeaking of pulled pork, a Ham joint also works as a good filling for sandwiches of you cook it the same way with maybe some alcoholic cider or apple juice depending on your preference in there. Tastes good mixed with mustard afterwards or just in a wrap with some crunchy greens a fruity chutney and some good vintage cheese.",

Sounds weird, but I promise you, it will take your Japanese curry to the next level.",

Cut beef into 1 \u00bd inch cubes and season with salt, black pepper, 2 tbsp of oil, and 1.5 tbsp of Curry Powder. Set it aside for 10 minutes.\u00a0\n\n2. In a pan, add oil and add sliced onions. Turn the heat up to medium-high and saute for 5-6 minutes or until it turns soft, translucent, and slightly brown. Remove the onions and set them aside.\u00a0\n\n3. In a large pot, add oil and turn the heat up to medium-high. Add the beef and saute for 3-4 minutes or until the outside is brown. Add in onions and mix them.\u00a0\n\n4. Pour in 6-8 cups of water and bring it to a simmer. Once it is simmering, put the lid on and let it cook for 30 minutes on medium-low heat. Stir occasionally, so it doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom.\u00a0\n\n5. After 30 minutes, add in potato and carrots and let it cook for another 30 minutes or until it becomes soft.\u00a0\n\n6. Finally, add in the grated apple, two pieces of dark chocolate, one pack of curry cubes, and 1.5 cups of whole fat coconut milk. Mix till everything is combined and cook for another 10 minutes. Serve with rice and ENJOY!\u00a0",

I use a 6qt? instapot.\n\n* -~1lb protein, usually 1 big chicken breast, brown it before you put it in the pot if you want, or throw it in frozen even if you cant be bothered.\n\n* -2 potatoes cubed/cut how you like and as much chopped celery and onion and other veggies as you care for, usually 2-4 cups or so\n \n* -~half an apple to taste if you have one sitting around, no worries if not. add other spices you like too like chopped garlic or even garlic powder, red pepper, etc\n\n* -use some sort of chik/beef stock if you have it, otherwise cover whatevers in the pot with water\n\n* -[1 box of S&amp;B golden japanese curry mix. Get the hot mix if you can find it](https://i.imgur.com/KPIFcIX.jpg)\n\n[cook low for a bunch of hours, usually 6-8 while you're gone - or high for 4-6 until everythings tender](https://imgur.com/a/0LaXBZG). you can even pressure cook for faster results i reckon but this is /r/slowcooking",

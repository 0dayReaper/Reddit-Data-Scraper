The carrots were just carrot flavored mush. 0/10 do not recommend. \n\nAdditional info: apparently the \u201c24 hr\u201d is how long it takes to cook.

She tried, though, I'll give her that. \n\nWhen I was a teenager, she discovered the crockpot, which was great for a working mom! But, she didn't know how to use it. \n\nMy sister and I found out she didn't know how to use it the first day she used it. \"Dinner is in the crock pot on the counter\" she told us. \n\nShe had literally placed 2 bone in pork chops in the cooker and set it to low for 6 hours or so. That's it. No liquid, nothing else. Just the 2 small porkchops. \n\nThey....were not tasty. \n\n(This was back in the early 90's before the internet took off)",

He was 30 when we met and had been on his own forever and a bag of bread, jars of peanut butter and jelly, gallon of milk and bag of apples or oranges and he is set. He will eat that every meal if need be. Does not care. I bought him a panini press when the kids were born and taught him to make panini and that is his pride and joy to serve one to the kids (or pie iron if camping) if I am not able to cook. I don't mind at all because he will clean the entire kitchen/dishes religiously every night so win/win to me because I like cooking and always get what I want to eat then.",

So wrong. \n\nI realized my mistake when I called and asked him to check a casserole I'd left in the oven as I was stuck in traffic from a wreck. He asked me how he'd know it was done and I think my brain short circuited. Turns out he's learned those few things by wrote.

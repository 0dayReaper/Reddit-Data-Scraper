Like, really a little. It's super strong. If I make a 5 lb pork roast I might use 2 tsp liquid smoke. I put on gloves, rub on the smoke, then rub on the spices.\n \nThen throw it under the broiler for a quick sear after it's done in the slow cooker.",

I add a cup of water to the bottom of the crock and lay the ribs in and cook for around 8-9 hours on low. Then I remove from foil and put them on the grill for a few min, each side with BBQ sauce.",

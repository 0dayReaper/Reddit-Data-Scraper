I never can find the magic 'number' for replacing instant rice with regular rice.\n\nMeasurement, cook time adjustment, extra liquid, extra seasoning...\n\nIf you cook it seperate, just season the rice to match the crock pot recipe then serve it on top of the rice, sidebyside, etc...always works for me.",

Maybe go with 1 1/2 - 2 cups  instead of almost 3 cups of instant.  Regular puffs up more &amp; will absorb the juice.  Just be sure to cook it long enough.  If you bite into it &amp; it isn't soft enough, cook it a little longer.  If its too dry, just add more chicken broth.",

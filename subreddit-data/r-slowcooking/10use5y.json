            "comment": "Cooking right now. I took some of my favorite tapas ideas and am cooking them into stew-soup hybrid. Big note- I just whipped this together as a creative person expression, it's very much a Work in progress and a use what I got not what I wish I had kind of recipe. So, if you make this do what you think is best. \n\nCalling it The Reds because it has mostly red ingredients, Spanish chorizo, red beans  tomatoes, red wine, saffron and smoked sweet paprika with a bit of smoked red chili flakes. I can't believe I'm out of diced tomatoes but do have some sauce I used but wish it was diced canned tomatoes. But I use what I got so here we are. \n\nThis a rough recipe: \n\nThe Reds Stew or (steoup?) - Spanish Tapas Style\nServes 4-5\n\n1/2 a zucchini diced\n\n10-13 crimini or  button mushrooms cleaned and rough diced\n\n1/2 cup of red wine \n\n14 oz Tomato sauce or diced tomatoes\nIf using sauce, add one Tablespoon of chicken or vegetable base like better than bullion or if using diced tomatoes add about 2 cups of chicken stock or broth.\n\n1 russet potato diced\n\n1 cup of cooked red beans- I have some dried heirloom ones I found in my cupboard I cooked last night, but you could use canned\n\n2 to 3 cloves of garlic, minced\n\nA few saffron threads\n\n2 tsp of Spanish herb seasoning or Italian herb seasoning ( Spanish might be hard to find,Italian is okay sub)\n\n1 tsp of red chili flakes, or to taste\n\n1 tsp of smoked sweet paprika\n\n2-3 Tbsp olive oil\n\nSalt to taste black pepper to taste\n\nHeat up a little stock or water to boil. Put saffron in a small bowl and pour a little water or stock over it,not more than 1/4 cup. Allow to bloom while prepping rest ingredients.\n\nI'm usually against pre sauteing stuff in slow cooker recipes but you really are going to get a better result here, so highly recommend you heat up in a late skillet some olive oil. I just sauteed all the veg and sausage except the potato, together until sausage was browned sprinkling some salt, pepper and 1 tsp of my herb blend. You probably should do the chorizo first, remove it and then do your vegetables, but you know, whatever you got time for. If you have tomato paste, I'd add a tablespoon or two here, but I don't have any right now. Add the garlic in for a minute or two. Remove vegetable mix from heat And put in your crock insert.\n\nRemove saffron threads from water. Add saffron water and rest of ingredients to crock. Cook on low for 5 hours or high 2-3 hours.\n\nI'll share results later.",

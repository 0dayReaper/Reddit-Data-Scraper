    "postText": "Pork Carnitas\n\n- 3lb pork shoulder\n- 1 Orange\n- 1 onion\n- 6 cloves of garlic (peeled)\n- 2 or 3 cinnamon sticks\n\n1. Chop pork shoulder into ~1 in cubes, pack tightly into crock pot\n\n2. Quarter the orange and the onion. Squeeze orange juice over pork, then stuff the orange peels into the pork, along with the onion, garlic, and cinnamon sticks (you can break the  cinnamon sticks in half if they are sticking out too much).\n\n3. Cook on low for 6-8 hours, or until easily shreddable. Remove the pork meat from the crockpot and shred. If it's too dry, ladle some of the crock pot juices into the shredded meat.\n\n4. Serve on tiny tortillas (so you can eat about a dozen in one sitting), along with diced onions, cilantro, tomatillo sauce, and lime.\n\nOptional: some people like to chuck the shredded pork onto a cookie sheet and then put it under the broiler to crisp it up a little. I am usually too hungry by the time it's ready to shred, so I tend to skip that step, but feel free to try if you have more willpower than me.",

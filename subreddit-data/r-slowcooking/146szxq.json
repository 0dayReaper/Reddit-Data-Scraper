Alton Brown has the science ( naturally) and the method. I believe you can find his good eats show on brining somewhere.\n\n\nAlso, I like poaching chicken breasts in my slow cooker. I don't brine them because my doc and I are compromising on my salt and caffeine intake but poaching  yields sliceable meat that is great for sandwiches and salads. I like to poach mine on high for about two hours or until they reach 163-164 F, remove and cover and let poaching them come up to 165 F. I usually poach seasoned chicken breasts  in about 1/4 c of olive oil to 1.5 cups court broth on top of a \"rack\" of onion quarters, carrot halves and celery. Nice thing about this is I save the broth and make chicken or other type soup later in the week. \n\nIf you look under my comments, you'll see a court broth recipe under poaching salmon scroll down the \"let's pretend I'm a food blogger\" blather  and you'll see it.\" Let me finish my coffee and I'll find the link for you.\n\nLastly, one awesome trick for flavorful juicy chicken breast is to use the same technique above and poach  it in a lemon and milk liquid base.  Wait no, don't go! hear me out. Jamie Oliver did this with a whole chicken and the lactic acid in milk all helps tenderize the meat. Kind of like a yougurt marinade does in Indian cooking. I've done this with pork and chicken and while the sauce is \"cottage cheesey\" looking it's also excellent.  The kitchen has an oven recipe that I adapted for slow cooker. I'm lazy and don't brown my chicken breast ( I probably would for skin on chicken ) but this basically follow this idea:\n https://www.thekitchn.com/jamie-oliver-chicken-in-milk-best-chicken-recipe-all-time-80388",

Take 1 pound of raw chicken breast and slice it into 2x2 inch pieces. Place the pieces of chicken onto the foil, then add your preferred seasoning in heavy quantity. We used a savory Cajun rub tonight and it was great. Smother the raw chicken in seasoning, then take the foil and form it around the chicken to make it into a kind of boat. Then, add water to the foil boat, enough to cover the bottom.\n\n You should have enough extra foil to then fold it down to form a tent over the chicken, creating a kind of aluminum container for the chicken. The point is to seal the aluminum to itself to keep all steam and moisture in the makeshift container, so press down firmly and be sure that the edges are sealed by folding and pressing them. You can put an additional sheet of foil on top of your foil boat if you didn't lay out enough to begin with or are having trouble sealing it to itself. \n\nFrom here, you can either bake the entire thing for 30 minutes at 400 or BbQ for the same time and temperature. You end up with juicy, tender chicken that is full of flavor, any flavor you like.",

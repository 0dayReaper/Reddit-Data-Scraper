    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m aware this may be stupid, but the other day I purchased a large chuck roast on discount at the Kroger and I popped it into the slow cooker on low for about 10 hours. I added enough liquid to cover and a whole sliced onion and spices/garlic; the onions came out like candy but the chuck roast, while deliciously tender, came out a bit dry. Is there a max time you should cook red meat in the slow cooker to avoid dryness? I\u2019m still a beginner, so tips are very appreciated !",

            "comment": "You were right to add some veg and liquid but, believe it or not, that much cooking will still dry out a relatively lean cut like a chuck roast. Consider replacing some of the water (and a little bit of the weight of the roast) with carrots, potatoes, celery and onions.  Garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper for seasonings.  In general, you want to do high heat for around 4 hours and low heat for 6-8 hours for large cuts of meat.  As u/viper21b mentioned, getting a sear on the outside of a large roast is generally a good idea to impart some extra flavor and create a barrier for juices escaping.  \n\nAlso!  thoroughly oil, salt and pepper your roast before searing.  Salt draws important searing proteins to the surface of meat and the oil allows the meat to cook in oil instead of against metal.",

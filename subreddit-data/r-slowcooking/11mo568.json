            "comment": "Set aside the rabbit's head, boney bits and the viscera you want to save. I don't enjoy liver or kidneys, but if you do, then add them with the meat pieces. \nFirst, confit (covered in oil, I used olive oil since I like the flavor and in Spain is not expensive) finely minced garlic and onion with salt and lots of thyme, black pepper and salt for 6 hours at 70\u00b0C. Then add the rabbit  and cover it with the oil and garlic/onion mix, and the vegetable chunks of your liking on top, covered with the oil too. (I used 3 onions and 3 garlic bulbs).\nCook for 5-6 hours more at same temperature until tender and almost falling of the bone.\nHeat off, leave it covered overnight for flavours to mix and penetrate.\nNext day, take out the vegetables, set aside. Take out the rabbit.\nFilter everything to separate from the excess oil (save the oil).\nSear the rabbit in a very hot pan, if oil is needed, use the one you saved.\nI seared the vegetables in the oven, grill setting, for time saving.\nBoth will be covered in oil, so not much more is needed.\nMeanwhile you are searing, sear with 3-4 oil spoons,  the heads and bony bits in a pot/pressure cooker, take them out, toast flour , I used 2 spoonfuls, re-add the bits and heads, cover them with white wine (2 cups), broth (2 cups), mustard (2 spoons), vinegar (I used apple cider. Vinegar, 3 spoons), salt, 2 spoonfuls honey. Boil for 30-40 min and let it reduce until it starts to thicken.\nMince a cup of parsley.\nMix it with the meat, vegetables, garlic, onion, and the newly made broth(filter it, don't add the heads and boney bits). Add some water if needed until it is kinda covered like the pic. \nEnjoy it over fries, pasta or rice.",

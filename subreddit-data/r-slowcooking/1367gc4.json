    "postText": "I'm doing a big BBQ in a few weeks. In addition to making hot dogs and burgers, I really want to make sausage peppers and onions like you'd get outside Fenway or on the street in New York. My question is: can I make the peppers and onions in the slow cooker earlier that day? Or am I going to end up with peppers and onions that are too mushy. My problem is that for the amount of food I'm trying to make, I don't have the grill space for the peppers and onions in foil. I was thinking maybe making them on the grill before the party starts and then keeping them in the slow cooker on keep warm as an alternative. Thoughts?",

You get two pans, put warm/hot water in the bottom a little less than halfway up, and put the food in the second pan that you put inside the first pan. The water buffer in the bottom pan keeps the food from burning, and everything stays really warm without overcooking. Also, you need no electrical outlet.\n\nOccasionally check the water to make sure it isn't all gone, and refill with hot water but just be safe that you don't get scalded. The pans do get hot!",

However, if you are sensitive to heat add one pepper at a time + the sauce)\n\n\u20228oz cream cheese\n\n\u20221 chicken bouillon cube\n\n\u20222 onions\n\n\u20222 poblano peppers\n\n\u2022Cumin, garlic powder, onion powder to taste. \n\n\nBoil chicken in water in the crockpot until done. Drain, saving approximately 1 cup of chicken broth. Shred chicken and return to crockpot. Cut onions and poblanos into strips and add to the chicken. \n\nIn a blender, add a block of softened cream cheese, chipotle in adobo, bouillon cube, seasonings to taste, and the 1 cup reserved broth. Blend until smooth and add to the chicken and veggies. \n\nCook on low for 4-5 hours, or high for 1-2. The chicken should already be cooked after boiling, so you just want to soften the veggies and let the sauce marinate the dish. \n\nAlternatively, if you want to add more depth to your dish, you can brown the chicken in a pan (I boil mine so my cat has a nice treat \ud83d\ude3b) and caramelize the onions/peppers on the stove before tossing everything together. I\u2019ve done it both ways and it\u2019s delish!\n\nPerfect for nachos, tacos, over rice, as a sandwich etc. enjoy!!!\n\n\nEDIT: forgot to add an ingredient.",

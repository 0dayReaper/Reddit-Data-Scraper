Instead of the separate spices, I added a tablespoon and a half of taco seasoning.\n\nIt's super similar to my normal crockpot taco recipe, where I just throw in chicken thighs or cheap beef.\n\nHonestly I'm super impressed. It's tasty, filling and super cheap. I de-veganed it with cheese (and sour cream for my husband), but it could easily stay vegan if you didn't need those things (we do).\n\nThrow on some lettuce, homemade pico, radish and hot sauce of choice - it's a super solid recipe. We doubled the recipe and have been eating it all week and it's holding up really well.",

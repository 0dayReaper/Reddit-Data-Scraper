Plum tomatoes, bacon, sweet onion, red bell pepper, celery, garlic, cloves, mace, allspice, clam juice, fish or vegetable stock, fingerling potatoes, Worcestershire, kosher salt, cholula sauce, catfish, parsley, banana peppers.  Let the flavors cook slowly.  Then add fish &amp; shrimp if you like at the end.  We serve over jasmine rice or grits.  The recipe is posted several places.\n\nCatfish is a good firm fish for stews.  Inexpensive and a perfect choice for this flavor profile.",

            "comment": "There's a huge variety in slow cookers - what you're looking to cook, and the amount, will help determine your size. If you have a family of 4 or less and want to use it to create a main meal (say a 3lb chuck roast with potatoes and carrots) then a 6quart would be fine. Large family? High volume? Go for the 8 or 10 quart. The 4qt is great for side dishes like rice or beans but it's really pretty small for anything else. Because they're so inexpensive I've got a couple (1-qt for dips/apps, 6qt for day-to-day, 10qt for parties).\n\nI don't like what I'm cooking to have a lot of extra room because it tends to dry out the food so whichever one I'm going to use will fit whatever I'm cooking fairly tight to start with (factor in shrinkage!)\n\nI don't use digital styles but that's my personal preference because I've used them for so many years that I just need the warm, low and high settings \ud83d\ude43. Plus I've found that the basic model has less parts to go bad than one with all the bells and whistles.",

A six quart will give you six or 7 servings. (You get more out of soups and stews)\n\nAn oval four quart is better than a three quart round one. It will cook a half a turkey breast, a small whole chicken or a small chuck roast",

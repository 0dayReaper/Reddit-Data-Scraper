    "postText": "One of the ways of making this delicious Indonesian dish (what I call the love child between a Thai and Indian curry) is you cook down the meat and sauce until it's try.\n\nIs it possible to do something like this in a slow cooker, perhaps half the liquid, and slow for 6 hours?  I don't anticipate it getting as \"dry\" as the traditional recipe, which I have made in a Dutch Oven, but most of the moisture definitely cooked out.",

You might be able to start it out this way but you need to take it to a stovetop and cook it down to bring it to a dry state.",

A chuck would be too fatty and greasy I assume (I have never eaten, just a quick google search).\n\nYou can always slow cook it all day, then throw it in a pan to cook off some moisture for 5 mins before you eat.\n\nGood luck!",

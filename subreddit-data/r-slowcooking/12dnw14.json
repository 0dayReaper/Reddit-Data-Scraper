I haven\u2019t made the soup but it seems like an okay substitution. If you don\u2019t have tortellini at all, there won\u2019t be a good direct substitution but you could probably do another type of pasta. You\u2019d miss out on the cheesy part of the tortellini but I can\u2019t think of any pasta that would have the cheese. Maybe if you really wanted the cheese, you could add something like velveeta to the soup and let it melt in? I feel like the tortellini purists will come for me now\u2026\ud83d\ude33",

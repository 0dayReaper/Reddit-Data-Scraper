They were ridiculously tender and juicy,  it was nearly impossible to get them out of the slow cooker without the meat just falling off. I wanted to put them under the broiler for a few minutes but a fussy 2 month old did not allow that. The flavor was great, my only complaint would be that these had a lot of large chunks of fat on them, wasn't difficult to sort it all out on the plate but it did make things excessively greasy/oily. Next time I'll probably use something to \"elevate\" the ribs, i.e. onion halves or wadded up foil ... and use far less liquid in the  bottom so the bottom ribs aren't swimming (completely submerged). I'm going to shred up some of them and make a sandwich for work next week. Thanks all for the upvotes and comments y'all are cool",

The only complaint I have is that in the end most of the meat will likely fall off the bones and it will be difficult to retrieve the rack from the crock pot whole.

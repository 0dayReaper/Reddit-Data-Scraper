    "postText": "I say \u2018Greek\u2019 because it\u2019s what we call it in our house but I\u2019m sure any self respecting Greek person would have a lot to say. So sorry Greek people.\nAnyway it\u2019s slow cooked garlic lamb deliciousness.\n\nRecipe:\nPotatoes peeled and chopped into big ish chunks. These are our fave bit so put in as many as you\u2019d like. \nCarrots peeled and cut into chunks.\nButternut squash as above.\nLayer veggies in the bottom of the slow cooker (mine is 6L for size reference)\n2 red wine stock pot- you can add wine if you want but you don\u2019t want a tonne of liquid and kept like this it makes the flavour super intense. \n1 beef stock pot \nGarlic bulb - halved\nOnion peeled and halved.\nLamb shoulder seasoned with salt pepper oregano and garlic powder.\nI put in about 300ml of water and topped it up after 4 hours. It\u2019s now got loads of liquid in so I probably didn\u2019t need to do that bit!\n\nCook on high 6 hours or until the lamb shreds with a spoon.\n\nI drain off the juice and make gravy and serve with the \u2018Greek vegetables\u2019 from the pot and roast potatoes because why the hell not!",

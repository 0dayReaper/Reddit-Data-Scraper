This is on all temperatures and from half to almost full. \n\nThis is my first slow cooker but this doesn't seem right. Do I have a faulty one, am I doing something wrong, any tips?",

If there is one, it might be worth it to give it a good scrubbing with dawn and a bristle brush. \nSometimes that tiny steam hole can get greasy on the rim and just retain water, making it harder for the steam to escape. \nIf theres no steam hole, you should definitely try the toothpick.. Just wanted to mention the issues that can arise from steamholes, in case thats what is ultimately causing the steam to try to escape from the lid rim.",

If pressure builds up inside the cooker, it can push the lid and any of the water out of the way to release that pressure.  That's how they're supposed to work -- they aren't pressure cookers.\n\nNormally the glass lids have a handle, which is attached by a screw going through a hole in the glass of the lid.  If that screw is loose, steam can escape through that hole to underneath the handle.  This is not intended, and it's a place where gross stuff could grow.  It would also produce water that stream down the *outside* rather than the regular condensation on the inside of the lid\n\nSo... yeah, tighten that screw.",

That creates a seal. Surface tension holding water in place until enough pools up to drip down. Instead of dripping inside the pot, the pressure buildup pushes the moisture out, not in,  causing it to drip down the outside of the crackpot.\n\nIn the comment I'm responding to,  the person is saying that the lid on the crock is not airtight. Which is true.  But the water that drops down. Does create a seal. So that steam can't escape. Except when it builds up enough to force it to drip.  Which is what OP is trying to avoid.\n\nFwiw,  my crackpot lid has a hole and I don't have the drip issue",

You just want to poke one end of the toothpick in where the lid and rim meet enough that it doesn't totally seal shut in that spot. I never noticed any difference in cooking that way, other than the lid condensation staying inside the pot.",

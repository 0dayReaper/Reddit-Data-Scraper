    "postText": "Was inspired by other posts about the whole chicken and thank you for posting. Some of my techniques will look quite familiar.  \n\nI browned the bottom in heavy skillet with a little olive oil spray. Tried to keep chicken from touching sides by using some rings and parchment. We love lemon chicken so I used citrus on hand and then rubbed with a mixture of Better than Bouillon chicken and roasted garlic. Sprinkled with salt and thyme.  High for 4 hours. Then broiled just a few minutes for some color. This is cooling then to fridge for supper and lunches this week - probably serve with jasmine rice, saut\u00e9ed sugar snap peas/red bell pepper strips and pan sauce. (I had to sample a wing) Cheers everyone!",

All that stuff that's left on the bottom (called \"fond\"), and even the sides, of pots or pans when you've cooked or seared meat (or anything that leaves those bits) if you \"deglaze\" them by stirring liquid, like wine, stock, even water, to scrape up the fond, then adding that liquid to the cooking liquid, depending on how much fond there is, will add a TON of flavor. Not taking advantage of that is sad; preventing it from even being created is...well, more than sad.",

I just put whole chicken in slow cooker with potatoes,onions,carrots,whatever you want on dinner plate later. It cooks everything so amazing. Roasted awesomeness. After however many hours,put whole chicken in broiler for skin crisp. You have veg,starch,and chicken,all roasted slowly to perfection. Yours doesn\u2019t look bad,it just seems you added unnecessary steps",

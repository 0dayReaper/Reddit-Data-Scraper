I served it with white rice made in my instant pot, delicious!\nI\u2019ve also done salsa chicken: 1.5-2lbs of chicken with a half of a 24 oz jar of salsa, you can switch out the chicken with a chuck roast, i cut it into 2\u201d slices so it cooks faster.  4-5 hours on low.\n\nCongratulations on the little one.

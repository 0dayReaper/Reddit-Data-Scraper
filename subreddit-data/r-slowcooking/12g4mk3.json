Recipe is by Skinnytaste (because I\u2019m also trying to be ensure I can get off my couch when my ankle heals) and can be found [here](https://www.skinnytaste.com/slow-cooker-moroccan-chicken-olive-tagine/) \ud83e\udd23\n\nI halved the recipe because its just me and I hate eating leftovers more than once and used raisins instead of prunes because I had them.  Topped everything with a dollop of greek yogurt with garlic, herbs and lemon juice mixed in and some harissa!",

    "postText": "Silly me put too many things on a high shelf, and when it collapsed (at 2am and scaring the p00p out of my dog and I) sadly my slow cooker did not survive the ride. The lid shattered, and the hinges snapped off. But I feel bad throwing it all in the trash!\n\nI know I could use the main pot insert for plants, but the heating base likely still functions too. Is there anything I can use it for without a lid? Tell me your ideas!\n\nAnyone know if the stoneware pot part could be put in the oven for casseroles?\n\nIt's an older (10 yrs?) name brand Crock Pot, 6 or 7 qt, removable oval stoneware inner.\n\nEdit: I can't just replace the lid as the hinge and lock broke off the base.",

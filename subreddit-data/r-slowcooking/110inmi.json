But for something that is east not having to mess with adding more charcoal and wood chips they come out great! You don\u2019t get the oh damn I had a flair up and now I am 100 degrees over what I should be on my smoker or the wind picked up and now it\u2019s way under temp. I do like messing with my grill a little bit and going out with a beer and checking on things gives me a good reason to dip outside for 5 minutes to check on things every now and then. \n\nTLDR: The CrockPot method does not disappoint and it\u2019s straight forward and easy.",

Throw on some chopped onions, orange zest, and chopped garlic. Cover them with a 50/50 mix of fresh squeezed oj and water.  Bring to a boil, then turn it down way low and simmer until its Fallin off the bone ~3-4 hours. Top off with water as needed to keep them covered.  Now you're going for some carmilization. Crank it up to hi and splash a cup of brandy.  Cook down the liquid and get a good sear going on.  Dump it out into a serving bowl.  Pull it apart with a couple of forks and pick out the rib bones.  I typically have a Pico de Gallo made with fresh lime juice and lime wedges provided, fresh guacamole,  some shredded cheese, and tortillas ...",

Slow cooker makes sure the ribs turn out tender. You finish it off in an oven to get the nice crispy texture. \n\nThis method gives you nice crispy, crunchy ribs that fall of the bone.  If you just eat it out of the slow cooker, you'll get nice soft meat but the texture just doesn't feel right. It will be soggy (the best way I can think of to describe the feeling).",

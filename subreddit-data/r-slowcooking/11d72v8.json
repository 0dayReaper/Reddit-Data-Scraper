    "postText": "Looking for recipe recommendations for 3 pounds of beef chuck roast.\n\nI impulse bought this chuck roast cause it was on sale, but I've never made a pot roast &amp; haven't bought other ingredients yet. What are your go-to recipes? \n\nI'm open to anything, doesn't have to be pot roast or stew, but that's what I was thinking. If 3 pounds is too big I'm open to cutting it in half and making two things. Is this meat good for tacos, too? Or bbq shredded sliders or something?",

            "comment": "I usually would cut something like that in half, put one piece in the freezer and cook the other. It's only 2 of us, that makes a more manageable amount and you have more meat for a different meal. \n\nPot roast is good (I adapted a recipe from Cooking Light years ago -- mainly I use tomato paste instead of ketchup, add some red wine and extra veggies). I also used chuck to make chili the other week, which worked out really well. Really anything with a slow braise will work (pot roast, chili, stew, taco meat, etc).",

I usually cut up some celery &amp; onion to set on the bottom of the pot, then put the roast in. Sprinkle a packet of onion soup mix on top, put in a cup of water or beef broth. Peel &amp; cut up potatoes and carrots (or just use baby carrots). Cook on high for 6-8 hours or low 8-10.\n\nGently remove veggies &amp; meat. Set aside on a platter &amp; cover to keep warm. Use some of the liquid to make gravy. I use one of those blender bottles used for protein shakes and mix like 1/4 c flour with a few ounce of water. Bring the beef stock to a boil in a small pot and stir the flour/water mixture in slowly. Season to taste.",

Once garlic is aromatic I add about 1/4 cup of black coffee, and a half cup of water and a chicken bullion cube or two (depending on size of roast) into the pan with the onions and deglaze the pan. Once deglazed and the bullion cubes are dissolved I pour this over the chuck roast and cook (low 8 or high 4 generally) until the beef is fork tender.  Shred the meat (can remove and large pieces of fat if desired), I then cook some essenhaus Amish noodles, drain and add into the crockpot and mix with the beef.  Serve with some type of potato (mashed or baked for us) and some crusty bread.  This is a family and friends favorite and is even better as leftovers.",

Move to slow cooker, add either broth or wine or your favorite marinade (maybe with some water) until it comes up about halfway on the beef. Cook low. When tender, pull apart with fork. Alternatively, keep all in dutch oven and bake at 300 for \\~2-3 hours.\n\nYou can use broth based liquids for beefy flavor, asian sauces for asian flavors, wine and herb for a French flavor, beer and chipotles for a Mexican style -- it is a very forgiving recipe that lends itself well to almost any combination you can think of.",

That's the risk of cooking too much in advance. 3 pounds seems like a lot to me cause I'm just cooking for myself. \n\nI think I still have some frozen burritos from the last time I made a big batch of carnitas from a giant pork shoulder like 6 months ago, after so many meals of the same thing the leftovers just end up sitting.",

            "comment": "I don't think a 3# chuck roast is too big, but I also easily use the whole thing.\n\nIf you have a smoker, you can make pastrami. Or, corned beef if you just brine. That will buy a week or two if you want to put it off.\n\nHowever, I love loading up my dutch oven with potatoes, carrots, other root veggies. I will often use a rub of mainly paprika, a bit of salt and brown sugar, and other seasonings I like such as a pinch of ground coffee or a few pinches of chili powder. Or, omit that and go tried and true Lipton's french onion soup powder packets and coat. I'll roast all this up and enjoy with some good bread, horseradish sauce, and with the fat but, some of the juices, and heavy cream, make a gravy. The reserved, non fatty juices make for a great au ju.\n\nBreakfast, chop up taters, maybe a carrot and another root veggies, and dice up a couple fatty pieces for aid in frying potatoes. Now you have roast beef hash.\n\nLunch, au ju for French dip sandwiches. Alternatively, I will do a take on a Philly cheese steak sandwich. Can be Italian too with bell peppers, red wine vinegar, spicy sausage, beef, etc.\n\nDinner can be a repeat or a stew. By the third day, most all root veggies are gone, and if there's enough, I will dice up for taco meat, frying up bell pepper, onion, a carrot, rib of celery, maybe even tossing in a bit of cooked potato. If I need to augment meat, I will toss in some chorizo.\n\nHope you enjoy!",

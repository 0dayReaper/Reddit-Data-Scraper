What the hell is this? Are these real cracks? I washed in the dishwasher maybe about a month ago.  Could it be mold? It\u2019s clean though and why would mold grow in this pattern?",

It seems now-a-days, most items are not repaired, just replaced.  I wish this were not the case.\n\nIf you choose to replace, look for newer features in some units:  Better circuit protection, locking lid, etc.  Have you ever tried an Instapot (or similar multiuse device)?  Sometimes it's nice to have pressure cooking and other features in your crockpot.",

You know how it can be really hard to clean an oven without oven cleaner? That is polymerized oil (and carbon build up from burned food particles). \n\nSeasoning is just thin layers of oil baked on, which is why regular dish soaps like Dawn doesn't ruin it. Dishwasher detergent can, as can traditional soap made with lye, if it is poorly formulated (lye being the active ingredient in most oven cleaners).",

Sand the rust off, with maybe a quick water rinse to get rid of any rust dust, then just dry it out on the stovetop and re-season it in the oven.",

Then I preheat it before putting food in it the next time. If I fry something and it doesn't wipe out easily I will boil some water in it on the stove, loosen the crud with a rubber or plastic spatula and then wipe out with a damp cloth and then dry with a paper towel. Because of the seasoning I don't like to dry it with a good dish towel, since it will leave something on it. After it's good and dry I will wipe it with a few drops of cooking oil on a paper towel and put it away, but I only do that if I've had water in it. I'm not sure if it's necessary.",

In ceramics you can purposefully do this for dry-use decorative dishes by adding frit (crushed glass) to get that crackle effect, but it's not good for wet applications b/c water/food/bacteria can get into those cracks and in this case the finish canstart shedding. I've also seen people get crackle-effect marbles by dropping hot marbles into cold water - the glass contracts faster than the material flows, so essentially it cools down so fast it starts tearing itself apart. I saw something similar as the aftereffect of a super hot cast iron skillet chucked into a cold lake. \n\nSo if the liner pot's still hot I'd recommend adding cold water a little at a time &amp; swirling to cool the ceramic/glaze a bit more gradually to possibly extend the lifetime of the next one",

Ceramics with a dry foot, (no glaze or partial glaze on the bottom) can absorb water through the unglazed surface area. The moisture can cause this pattern while it\u2019s trying to escape or due to microscopic expansion, depending upon the clay body\u2019s degree of vitrification. This can happen with China also. Thermal shock can do this as well.",

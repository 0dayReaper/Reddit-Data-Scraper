It was really as simple as tracking their meals with an app and if they were eating within 2.5 hours of their last meal, upping the amount that you feed them. If they start spitting up or seem uninterested in finishing then decrease it. Once they hit 10 lbs and were able to go a bit longer between meals we started trying to rock them back to sleep at night rather than jump straight to feeding them.\n\nOh yeah, not all babies are the same and not all formula/breastmilk is the same. After switching to enfamil gentlease, we have had far fewer issues with upset stomachs. This was after trying breastmilk and three other kinds of formula and they would always wake up gassy at night on anything else.",

One of the boys. I'm still called that and I'm in my 30's. If I went somewhere I was to ask him too. My friends were his friends. Every social engagement had the twins. Ask the twins to come. Don't forget the twins. Which one are you? What's the other ones name again? Or you computer_d or the other one? Everything had to be equal and everything was shared so when I was older and someone got something different to me it'd really bug me. His business was my business. I knew everything that was going on in his life, and likewise for him. Now I distance myself so much that when I hear the smallest negative thing about his life I get irrationally upset and angry so I keep quiet about my life which causes its own problems.\n\nI was, still am, defined by being a twin and I think it had a pretty severe impact on the development of my character. I don't feel I got to be who I wanted to be until I had left school and had the choice to go a different way and even then I struggled, only really finding out who I was in my mid to late 20's. The way I feel I was treated has caused a big divide between me and my family as I think they failed me significantly by raising twins instead of raising two individuals. I realise it's hardly fair to blame my parents but I honestly feel like a huge part of my childhood was taken from me and this is having a profound impact on me in my 30s.\n",

I made them the freezer meals before baby came as mom was on low activity until baby showed up. The doc was for after the baby. I tried to make some specific requests in terms of food preferences and allergies, also an option on meal train. I also asked people to just leave the food and not expect a visit. As one of the only people that has a kid already, I thought that part was important. The point is to help (edit: not tell) them through the toughest part with no expectations from them.",

I prepped 5 of them in one day and thawed them to eat one by one over the next month or so. Every single one was terrible. I went back to the website and realized that it was made to be paleo, but the recipes were far from ridiculous or lacking in flavorful ingredients. Most contained potatoes, which I found out turn black when you freeze them, and makes them extremely unappetizing (even though it doesn't alter the flavor). Regardless, all 5 came out watery, extraordinarily bland, and I ended up throwing them all out before I could eat the leftovers.\n\nI only mention all this because now I'm very wary, but the convenience is still *so* appealing. I'd love to hear how these worked out for you, maybe there's hope for freezer crock pot meals after all!\n\nEdit: [Found the website](http://www.stockpilingmoms.com/2016/06/20-slow-cooker-freezer-meals-in-4-hours/).

The brand is Tiger. They\u2019ve given me my own since I\u2019ve moved out and it cooks just as good as my parents. \n\nI also recommend going to the Asian market and buying Jasmine rice. When you\u2019re about to cook the rice, make sure to give the rice a thorough rinse to wash the starch off (the water will become more clear as you keep rinsing). This I feel makes the rice taste much better and makes it fluffier. The amount of water that should be added is equal to the mount of cups (the small rice cup that comes with the rice cooker) you put into your cooker. So 2 scoops of rice = water up to the level 2 marker in the cooker. \n\nHope this helps a bit!",

I've found that variety has been important for us, and I've been flipping through a few recipes from Indian and vegetarian cookbooks as well.\n\nI can't stress enough how great beans/lentils are. I would recommend boiling them for 15 minutes to half an hour before putting them in the slowcooker/freezer bag, but man are they cheap (just beans, not lentils). You lose the gas-inducing components and they often form a nice thickening agent that adds some filling-ness to it. They're also cheap as shit.\n\nThe other thing is think about stuff that might not have to be prepared in this way. These look amazing, but are there any of them that you could get away with not freezing? Maybe just a can of corn, black beans, rotel, and a couple chicken breasts? Can of pineapple, chicken, soy sauce, and worchestershire sauce? Those will be even more helpful as time wears on.\n\nGood luck and godspeed. You may feel like you're failing a lot, but everyone does and caring and trying to get better is what makes you a good parent. If they're not your first, then you already know and I'm just saying this to make myself believe it.",

    "postText": "Hiya, so I've currently got a gammon joint in the slow cooker that'll cook for 6 hours, I'd normally finish it off in the oven with a honey and mustard glaze. Partner doesn't like the sweetness of the honey so wants me to do it without glaze, but I'd still like to crisp it up a little in the oven after. Can I just put a little olive oil on it and shove it in the oven or would that not work? Feeling a bit stupid asking but can't find any recipes online without a sweet glaze!",

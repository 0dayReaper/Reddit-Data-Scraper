Scatter onions in the bottom of a slow cooker then top with chicken. Season with oregano, salt, pepper\n2. Pour condensed chicken soup and chicken broth on top. Add the bay leaf and sprigs of thyme \n3. Cover and cook on high until chicken is cooked through, about 3 hours \n4. Discard thyme and bay leaf. Shred chicken using 2 forks. \n5. Stir in celery, carrots, peas, and garlic \n6. Cut biscuits into small pieces, then stir into chicken mixture. Spoon liquid over any biscuits on top \n7. Cook on high until vegetables are tender and biscuits are cooked through, about 1 hour more. \n\nI would probably add at least the carrots, maybe the celery, in at the beginning to help them cook through. Also, as I said in the ingredients I couldn\u2019t find thyme sprigs so I used powdered thyme and it still tasted good.",

I think I was too ambitious and cut all 8 into 4ths. I had to leave it cooking for 2+ after adding the veges/ biscuits before it felt \u201cdone\u201d - I\u2019m not even sure it was. It was delicious though! The recipe was great. I just think I messed up my dumplings",

Also my crockpot has a timer and will go to \u201cwarm\u201d when it\u2019s done so I think it sat on warm for a bit. \n\nI can tell you my friend who gave me the recipe said her biscuits cooked for about 2.5 hours until she decided they\u2019re done. \n\nI agree it\u2019s harder to determine if they\u2019re done since they don\u2019t color like normal!",

You can also use a bag of frozen peas and carrots and leave the on the counter to defrost before putting them in at the same time you put in the biscuits. Way simpler if you don\u2019t have fresh veggies on hand (like, say you were living during a pandemic...)",

Essentially a chicken stew that can be served over rice, biscuits or as chicken and dumplings as you did.\n\nAnother twist is to do it in a casserole dish and lay the biscuit dough out on top allowing them to bake into sort of a chicken pot pie crust.\n\nI've recently discovered the magic of making this in my instant pot in less than an hour. It's been a great thing for quick wholesome meals during the week.",

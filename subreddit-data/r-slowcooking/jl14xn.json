You have to start in spring. Use the A/C mainly to pull out humidity and only to slightly drop the temp from outside. \n\nI never run A/C in my car unless it's raining and I keep my house A/C somewhere around 82 or 83 but set the humidity down around 30%. What crushes most people in the south is running the A/C at 70 or whatever and running the A/C in the car on full blast. When you do that, you never adapt to the outside heat and you just melt whenever you go outside.",

I can't remember if the skin was left on or removed, but it was served over angel hair pasta with some sorta hollandaise sauce or similar. It didn't taste cheesy, but it may have been a flavorless cheese but was ultra-creamy and paired perfectly with the chicken &amp; mushroom sauce.\n\nAny tips or advice would be greatly appreciated! \ud83d\ude01",

If you're a super lazy and rushed cook like I am you may be inclined to skip it but it really matters here.",

Remove the chicken and pull off the skin (you can actually save it for later and put it in a pan a make crispy skin snack if you like).  \n\nThen deglaze with some wine and scrape it all off.  Mushrooms get saut\u00e9ed in quantities to not over crowd the pan to get browning; you can use the pork fat here to saut\u00e9 them.  \n\nThen saut\u00e9 off your mire poix.  Add tomato paste if you like.  At this point you add some flour (sanger avec fleur) and let it cook for a couple of minutes to make sure you get thickening for later.   \n\nThen you can add stock to get it all cleaned out.  At that point you can dump everything (ie more wine, stock, pearl onions, herbs, etc.) in if you want to go low and slow.  It\u2019s a bit of effort, but caramelizing everything first makes a big difference.  Your veggies will turn out like mush, but if you like the texture of the chicken with that method, then go for it.  My favorite dish is Bouef bourguignon, so it\u2019s pretty much the same as Coq au Vin but with beef instead.  But I do enjoy Coq au Vin as well.  \n\nThe white sauce seems like it was a bechamel.  It seems like gilding the lily, but I guess it could be good?  Coq au Vin should already have a nice sauce.   You can always throw butter into it\u2019s sauce at the end if you want to enrich it.\n\n\nHope that helps",

After that the fat of the chicken will start to render out and take care of itself.  The trick is to be sure to be patient or else the chicken will stick to your pot/pan. \n\nYes, searing the chicken skin on is to build fond so you get a richer flavor. \n\nYou can definitely sear the onions before adding it all in.  But pearl onions are difficult to peel raw.  So  you can blanch them first.  Have an ice bath ready and put them in there.  Then cut off the root end as closely as you can.  Squeeze the onion from the stem end and it should pop right out.  Then you can sear them if you like.\n\nYes, remove all the mushrooms before adding the mire poix.\n\nOnce you have everything set and you get your liquids in, if you used flour, then make sure to stir it so that it doesn\u2019t clump.  It\u2019s similar to making a roux or a buerre manie, it\u2019s just that you\u2019re using the fat instead of butter.  Then you can throw in your chicken and everything else.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want too mushy of veggies, you can save the pearl onions prepare a little more mire poix and add them later.  But you do want a base of the chicken, wine, stock, pork, your initial mire poix, herbs and mushrooms to braise together so the flavors meld.",

Marinade the chicken: In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces, wine, onions, carrots, garlic, and bouquet garni. Cover and let marinate for at least 2 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator.\n\n2. Cook the chicken: Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserving the marinade. Dry the chicken pieces and season with salt and pepper. In a large, heavy pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the chicken and set aside.\n\n3. Prepare the vegetables: In the same pot, add the butter and mushrooms, cooking until browned. Remove the mushrooms and set aside with the chicken. Add the onions and carrots from the marinade, cooking until the onions are translucent.\n\n4. Build the stew: Sprinkle the flour over the onions and carrots, stirring to coat. Cook for a minute to remove the raw flour taste. Gradually add the reserved marinade (including the liquid), stirring to prevent lumps. Add the tomato paste and brandy, stirring well. Return the chicken and mushrooms to the pot, cover, and simmer for 2-3 hours until the chicken is tender and falls off the bone.\n\n5. Prepare the cream sauce: In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, and white pepper. Slowly drizzle in the melted butter while whisking the yolk mixture to create an emulsion. Keep this hollandaise sauce warm.\n\n6. To serve: Ladle the coq au vin over a bed of cooked angel hair pasta, then drizzle with the hollandaise sauce. Enjoy!\n\nRemember, for optimal results, marinate the chicken for a longer period (overnight if possible), use high-quality wine and mushrooms, and give the stew ample time to simmer and develop flavor. Enjoy your cooking experience!",

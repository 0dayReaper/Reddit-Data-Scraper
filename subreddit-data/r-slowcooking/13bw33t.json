    "postText": "My wife and I have gone through 2-3 slow cookers in the last 4/5 years and are looking for recommendations for a new one as we're tired of buying garbage. We've had heating elements break and pots crack and split which has ruined meals and been an absolute disaster at the last minute. \n\nWe usually use the slow cooker once per week, cook a meal for 15+ hours (we have to put it in the night before due to schedule issues). We'd like it to be as simple, basic, and analog as possible without timers, sensors, or anything else which could break or go wrong. Temperature settings are also important as even the \"low\" the cheaper ones we've bought is too hot even for shorter cooks\n\n\nAny and all recommendations are appreciated",

I would never leave my Slow Cooker on for 15 hours. Even 8 to me is very excessive but sure.\n\nAs someone mentioned sudden change in temperature will cause cracking. Though extremity in heat - especially for prolonged times will also.\n\nCeramic does best if it has liquid to conduct and absorb the heat away from itself. Where as air is harder to transfer heat to, so the ceramic walls can potentially overheat. Bigger Slow Cookers are more susceptible because they're more likely to have less food in them. There's a common principle associated with changing the level to which they are filled - this is in similar vein, so as not to form a ring that has been excessively heated compared to the rest.",

I just used it to make applesauce in this weekend. It is just off, keep warm, low, and high, and doesn't even have an \"on\" light. But it just keeps on cooking), you'll have a slow cooker that will heat faster than you want for your needs. \n\nI did quite a bit of research after deciding to get a slow cooker recently in a bigger size, and went with a model that has some insulation in the unit to keep it from overcooking: KitchenAid KSC6223SS with the standard lid. I find on this model I use the medium and high settings most often, but it works almost exactly like my small Hamilton Beach cooker. You might find that the low might fit your needs. I've been very happy with it, and it was recommended by America's Test Kitchen, too.",

            "comment": "Honestly I think an Instapot would be better for you since you can cook the same types of meals as a slow cooker but really quickly. Having the food prepped and in the fridge so you can drop it in when you walk in the door and it's ready quicker than you starting from scratch with a meal. I think the inserts are metal so you don't have the same temperature change concerns as you do with ceramic. There are tons of online communities you can check out to see if that might be a good fit.",

I just put in a frozen whole chicken w 2 cups chicken broth and pressure cooked 40 min. Fell off bone. So juicy, most and tender. The skin wasn\u2019t crisp but if I want that I can put in oven and bake or broiled skin",

Have served me well for many years but unfortunately the company went into liquidation, which was a damn shame as there customer support was brilliant. If it broke, I would def look for another on Ebay etc. But you may not be in UK.\n\nAlso it has a nice simple rotary knob with Off, Low, High and Auto heat so great for using say an Alexa control plug with it and start it up before you get home. I think most have this simple control knob",

Right now I've got 3 crock pot brand cookers (2qt 4qt 7qt) and they are all chugging along just fine for the past few years. No issues with running hot, no issues at all to be honest. All of them are just simple analog low high warm settings with no timers.",

I have a kitchenaid slow cooker that works so well people on Amazon reviews complain it doesn't heat up. That's how I knew to get it. On low, this thing does real slow cooking. Works like a dream. It isn't cheap, I think I paid around $200 CAD, but it has been worth it. Nothing has broken. Yes, it has an electronic timer but it works well. Has low, medium, high settings. I've only used low.",

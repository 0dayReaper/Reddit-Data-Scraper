                    "comment": "Not entirely true. There is no doubt about the flavor benefit to almost anything that is caramelized. When you caramelize onions, for example, the fond (browned bits left on the bottom, and even sides, of the pan) holds a lot of umami flavor. When added to your slow cooker contents, what is \"undone\" by braising dissolves into the liquid, which does add flavor. You should even use whatever liquid you are going to be using for your dish to scrape up any fond from the bottom and sides of your saut\u00e9 pan to make the most use of that added flavor. It may be subtle, but it does add to the flavor profile.",

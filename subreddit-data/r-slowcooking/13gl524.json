But no luck so far.\n\nI\u2019m looking for quick dump and go recipes, I tried looking up online but most of them were time taking ones (like saut\u00e9ing before in a separate pan, blending everything etc) \n\nMy goal is to find quick recipes I can dump in crockpot and let it cook overnight or a few hours during the day.",

Season with salt, pepper, paprika. \n\nAdd chopped garlic, juice of half a lemon, lemon zest (optional) and butter or olive oil or both.  \n\nSecret ingredient: sprinkle of red pepper flakes! Gives it a tiny kick that\u2019s delicious. \n\nPour half of each: can of Campbell\u2019s cream of mushroom soup, and can of chicken broth. Splash of white wine optional. Put chicken breasts or boneless thighs on top. (I used chicken breasts.) Pour rest of soups on top. Same seasoning (from before) on the chicken. If I\u2019m going to be gone all day, I stir it all up at this point. Cook on low 7-8 hours. \n\nSprinkle parsley on top and serve with white rice and a salad. I usually make the rice but I made Stovetop stuffing instead last night because it\u2019s my boyfriend\u2019s favorite. It was yummy, but not as healthy as the rice. \n\nIf you want to get a little fancy, saut\u00e9 some mushrooms on high heat with butter, then add the last hour. I only occasionally do this, but it really is delicious. \n\nDinner rolls are a great addition as well.",

Get a packet of Au Jus powder mix and a packet of ranch powder mix \u2014 I personally use maybe half of the packets to lower the salt and such, it still tastes great but YMMV. Then get a nice big jar of pepperoncini peppers. And some stick butter, again the recipe will say use a stick but I\u2019ve found a few tablespoons works perfectly well.\n\nSo - put the meat in the crock pot. Sprinkle the top with the two powders in your desired amount. Fish about 5-10 peppericinis out of the jar and place them on top of the roast. If I\u2019m feeling feisty or getting to the bottom of the pepper jar I\u2019ll put a lil juice in the crockpot just for funsies. Then finally set the butter on top.\n\nThen set on low for 8 hrs.

If you want one extra step, pre-cook some bacon and throw the bacon bits in there. (If you leave the breasts whole, shred them with a fork before serving) \n\nIf you want to skip the milk and cream cheese you could in theory sub in Greek yogurt and lots of shredded cheddar though I've never done that in a slow cooker, only for home made high protein queso sauce.\n\n\n\nAnother is to make homemade Boston baked beans, though you have to soak them the day before.\n\n\n\nAnother is a roast dinner. You can load your roast, carrots, onion, mushrooms, celery, and garlic into the pot with two cups of water, leave and come home to an almost perfect dinner. Then you just drain the fluid into a pot and stir in some flour over low heat while you boil your potatoes, I highly recommend throwing your roasted garlic and some cream cheese and chives into the potatoes when you mash them and mashing aggressively until they are very smooth. Not as one-step as you were after, but a hell of a lot better than most one step meals. \n\nStew is another option. It's basically the roast but with the meat cut in chunks and some chopped potatoes thrown in. In either case don't forget to season the meat to your own personal tastes. Doing things the one step way will never be as good as doing them the proper way, but I do love the efficiency for regular meals instead of spending hours smoking, searing and slow roasting the old fashioned way.",

            "comment": "Here us how I have made BBQ Beef or Pulled Pork probably hundreds of times for almost seventy years, very dump and go: put about 1 1/2 lb beef chuck or any lean pork in the slow cooker. Do not pre-brown it, just dump it. Mix the sauce ingredients: a chopped onion or two, a chopped green or red pepper, 1 tsp salt,  1/8 tsp hot red pepper, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp cloves, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup vinegar, 16 oz canned tomato sauce or crushed tomato, a can of water to rinse the can out. Cook for 5-6 hours until meat is falling apart. Tear meat apart with 2 forks and mash it up with potato masher or hoist it out on a cutting board and give it a few chops.  Taste and correct seasoning to what you like. Add more liquid if you want. There should be a LOT of sauce as you want it to soak into the hamburger buns on which you eat this. The meat should be super-tender and with lots and lots of sauce.",

            "comment": "Here\u2019s a quick tip: the next time you grill, throw some extra steaks on. Season them as you normally do. Sear them, but don\u2019t cook them past med-rare. After dinner, freeze the extras and use them as an easy alternative to roast beef. Just toss them in the slow cooker with a can of beef consomm\u00e9 and slow cook for about 6 hours on low. If you don\u2019t mind making a quick roux, the pot juices make a tasty beef gravy in 5 minutes. Steam some baby carrots or broccoli in the microwave. We usually add ready-to eat mashed potatoes (such as Bob Evans or Simply Potatoes) or split an air fryer baked potato, but that\u2019s just for a gravy delivery system. \ud83d\ude00 \nOur total hands-on time is about 2 minutes on the front end and less than 10 minutes right before dinner.",

I\u2019d mix up whatever I had (usually carrots, potatoes, onions, garlic, noodles or gnocchi if you want heft to it, vegetable soup stock and just leave it there to cook all day. One especially good one I made was a chicken carcass with all the flavouring vegetables and gnocchi. It was stupendous!!",

Maybe 1/2c\n\nAnyways, cook a big ass onion in the liquid in the pan\n\nMix up spices, 1tsp of baking soda, 2-3 tbsp of cumin, 2-3 tablespoons of chili powder, a tablespoon of oregano. \n\nWhen the onion is translucent put it in a  preheated crock pot. \n\nMix in spices, add some hot water to loosen everything up. \n\nAdd meat, then add enough water to cover the meat around 1/2 half way. It\u2019s done when fork tender. \n\nTake the dripping and onions and make gravy, you can reduce the liquid a bit and add a slurry of flour and water or potato starch and water, your choice. \n\nThere ya go.\n\nIt\u2019s better if you take a little bit of time to go to flavor town. This just requires a decent carbon steel, or stainless pan.",

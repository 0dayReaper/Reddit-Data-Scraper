Collect the chicken bones, onions, carrots, celery stalks, garlic cloves, bay leaf, and peppercorns.  \nStep 2: Add the Ingredients to the Slow Cooker  \nAdd the chicken bones, onions, carrots, celery stalks, garlic cloves, bay leaf, and peppercorns to the slow cooker. Pour enough water over the ingredients to cover them completely.  \nStep 3: Cook on Low Heat  \nSet the slow cooker to low heat and cook the chicken stock for 8-10 hours. Cooking the stock on low heat allows the flavors to meld together and create a rich and flavorful broth.  \nStep 4: Strain the Broth  \nOnce the stock is done cooking, strain it through a fine-mesh strainer into a large bowl. Discard the solids.  \nStep 5: Chill the Broth  \nChill the chicken stock in the refrigerator until it is completely cooled. Skim off any fat that rises to the surface.  \nStep 6: Store the Broth  \nStore the chicken stock in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. Alternatively, you can freeze the stock for up to six months.  \nFull Recipe: https://justrecipes.space/slow-cooker-chicken-stock/",

Adding some vinegar helps leach minerals from the bones, too.  Rinse the container with some hot water to get all the good flavor from the solution they use on the chickens, too.\n\nI also scald my already clean jars, fill them with the hot broth and put the lids on.  Let them cool on the counter at least until you hear the snap of the lids sealing then refrigerate.  They will keep well for two to three weeks that way.\n\nGood luck.",

Since I always get rotisserie chickens at Sam\u2019s, and I hate to see those bones go to waste, I start with those. You can also save the bones from your beef steaks or roasts and make bone broth from them. Save them in the freezer until you get enough of a batch. The flavor of a broth you make at home will amaze you in comparison to storebought broth and it\u2019s essentially free, made from scraps you would throw out. It\u2019s good just as a hot drink.",

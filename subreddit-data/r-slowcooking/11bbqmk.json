    "postText": "I\u2019m planning a meal prep party for a few friends who are pregnant. The idea is everyone chooses their favorite slow cooker recipe. Then they bring enough ingredients for each guest and we spend the day prepping all of the meals, while also hanging out. Everyone gets to leave with however many meals prepped so they can freeze them at home and have when they need something easy. \nHas anyone ever held a party like this before? Does anyone have any tips or ideas to make it easier or more fun? \nThank you in advance!!!\n\nEdit: sorry everyone, i guess I didn\u2019t explain it well. But we aren\u2019t going to be eating the food there, just prepping it so the moms can take it home to freeze and use later. Thank you to everyone for your helpful advice!!!",

            "comment": "This is a neat idea!  \n\nYou might want to check in with the guests in advance about any food preferences/allergies/sensitivities they and their families have, as well as the size of their slow cookers, the better for everyone to plan recipes and volume.  \n\nWill you be providing a sufficiency of cutting boards, prep knives, prepped-meal containers (and a way to label them), etc?  If not, ask participants to bring their own of those, too, if they can.   It could also help to ask people to bring a copy of their food's cooking instructions for for each participant.\n\nIf you're willing, it might be nice to broaden the scope to *any* freezer-prep/make-ahead dishes, not just slow-cooker ones, for when a new parent (or anyone else!) has had a rough day and needs food sooner than a slow cooker would have it ready.  That might make it easier to include sides and desserts, too, unless everyone in your group has multiple slow cookers.",

Your idea is really sweet though, because you will get to spend all day together and then enjoy the food and celebrating pregnancies is so nice. \n\nI would say to not have more than 6 people there or you may need to make double batches and it gets to be a lot.\n\nPlus you will want to have enough so you all can eat a serving there as well as take it home. \n\nSo for our soup party, we measured it in quarts. We had 6 people. You bring 6 quarts: 5 for the others to take home, and one to share at the party. \n\nAlso as another commenter pointed out, if they arrive in the morning and you cook for 8 hours, you will need to serve some lunch. That can be simple enough: serve some meat, cheese, lettuce etc for making their own sandwich or tacos. \n\nAnd maybe some simple cheese and crackers for late afternoon snacking. Especially since sometimes meals are not ready after eight hours. \n\nCome back and tell us what you all made and how it went!\n\nThat would be a fun idea for a girls weekend also.",

            "comment": "Think about how many servings a crockpot holds and how many servings will be needed based on attendees and their family size. Will each person go home with only one or two servings of each meal? \n\nA crockpot meal typically takes 5-8 hours to cook. You will need to feed everyone in attendance a meal or two during that time.\n\nWriting out complete ingredients lists is important because many people have dietary restrictions and allergies. Some may also want to have a copy for future reference. \n\nIf the purpose of this entire day is meal preparation, I would consider adding some recipes that can be prepared while you wait on the slow cookers. \n\nThere are several meal prep subs, try r/mealprep and r/mealprepsunday.",

Having food on hand for guests is always a good idea, but I didn't think they'd be doing the slow-cooking at the party.",

I had a couple of those recipes not turn out, even though they were directly from websites that were about pre freezing crock pot meals. The one I remember best was a stew that had potatoes in it, something about freezing the potatoes before cooking them made them turn in rocks and the whole thing was ruined.",

Since that\u2019s a lot of people bumping about in a kitchen, and some of them potentially a little more to bump into\u2026unless you have a giant kitchen, it could be cumbersome for all to be prepping at the same time.\n\nAlso, if each person is prepping each of the different meals for themselves, then you may also have some chaos with varying cooking skills, directions, etc.\n\nMaybe have each person demo and prep all of the food for their recipe for the group. They can essentially teach the recipe to the rest of the group while the others can just hang out and watch and chat. That way the person can show how they do it. I suspect for many, it will be easier to demo and talk about it than to have to try and field questions on the fly, etc. for friends about how to do something.\n\nHave each person also bring written copies of the recipe for each person. This allows you to have just one person prepping at a time. While prepping for 4-5 may take a little longer, it will likely still be faster than attempting to set up for and manage 4-5 people prepping at the same time. It would also be more social and less of a production line?",

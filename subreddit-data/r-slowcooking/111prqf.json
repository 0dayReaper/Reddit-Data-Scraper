            "comment": "Yes, I know it looks better cooked, but  to be honest we always forget to take a picture of it then, because we are so busy eating.  \n\nBasically what you do - or at least what I do - is add whatever veggies you like, to the crock pot.  I usually use Carrots, potatoes, onions, garlic, mushrooms and anything else I have in the fridge.  Then add your Chuck Roast.  If I have time I salt and pepper it, and brown it on all sides, in a super hot skillet - if you do that, pur any juices on top!\n\nThen add a packet of ranch dressing mix - you could make your own - a packet of au jus gravy mix and rub it all over said roast. You can also add some to the veggies underneath.  Then add a few pats of butter - I've used the healthy, butter free vegan stuff and it was still great.\n\nNotwadd some whole pepperoncini peppers from a can.  The last time I cooked this, I used the chopped pepperoncini's and they everything  was SUPER hot!  You can also use dill pickles, if you don't like Pepperoncinis.  \n\n\nNow just cook for 8 hours, or until it's falling apart tender.  It's great served with buttermilk biscuits.  :). \n\nTake everything out, with a strainer, and turn your crock pot to high.  Add some cornstarch to cdvwatsr, and pour in, but only if you'd gravy is too thin.\n\nI've made many roasts over the years, including ones with whine, and all sorts of complicated directions, but this one is still my favorite.",

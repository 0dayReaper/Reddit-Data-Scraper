    "postText": "Hi everyone.  \nI am new to using a slow cooker and was planning on making a beef goulash tonight.  The recipe calls for 6-7 hours cooking on low, but I will only be able to cook it for 4-5 hours in the slow cooker.  If I put it on high first for 2 hours then low for 3 will it still come out tender?  \nThank you",

These two things alone can cut an hour off of cooking time. You can preheat a cooker quickly by filling it with hot tap water and let it stand for about 5 minutes.",

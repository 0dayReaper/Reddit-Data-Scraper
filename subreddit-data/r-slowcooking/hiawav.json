I just followed the directions in the packet which was just put in slow cooker with 3\u201d of water and provided seasoning packet for 8 hours. I sliced some and shredded some. I think I prefer the shredded. The fat globules were kinda weird so I just tried to separate them and toss :/ guess that\u2019s up to your preference.\n  \nThe reuban sandwich was delicious. Husband walked in and smelled the sauerkraut and got really grossed out lol.\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t spell apparently. Reuben not reuban. My bad guys.",

Russian Dressing and Thousand Island are on two different sides of a spectrum of creamy dressings made from ketchup/mayo/chili-sauce/dairy/pickles-- you can heat it up horseradish, and there are lots of different pickles to choose from which alter the spice and tang.",

Sautee your onions, carrots, mushrooms with butter and salt and put ontop of chicken. Follow with the can of cream of mushroom, bouillon cubes, garlic and lemon juice. Toss in spices and adjust salt and pepper to taste.\n\nFor thickening I bake about a half cup of flour in the oven on a foil surface 350 for an hour. Put into pot and fill with water until you're about an inch from the top. Cook for ~8 hours on low.\n\nDisclaimer- No grandmas were harmed in the making of this stew.",

    "postText": "I've had a Hamilton Beach 6qt Slow Cooker (Model #33967) for going twenty years and I love it! I always knew the faceplate control board would eventually go out, and alas, today it bit the dust. After doing a littlw digging, I cannot seem to locate any source or vendor that carries replacement control boards. Would any of you fellow slow cooks be able to point me in the right direction for a replacement, or is this irreplacable? When you press the power button, the lights flicker for a second before shutting off.\n\nAnd before anyone thinks about giving the snide answer, \"Just buy an Instant Pot,\" I already have one, but I cannot part ways with my crockpots. Too much bond and history.",

I suspect the process of accessing it would cause fatal damage to the sealed edges of the crockpot.\n\nI am finding new in the box 33967 cookers on Amazon for about $70, used for about $40. This is likely your best path forward; name the new one \"mighty cooker 2\" or something like that.",

            "comment": "First thing I would do is take off the one that has failed and see if there's any fixable issue. You'd have to take it off to replace it anyway. Could be something as simple as a loose or corroded wire. \n\nI too form weird bonds with inanimate objects, though admittedly never with a crock pot. If you can't fix it nor find that part sold separately, your next option would be to buy the same crock pot and cannibalize it for parts. Probably end up being about the same price for the part as a full replacement anyway but with the bonus of a spare crock insert and lid.\n\nBest of luck!",

It was fine tasting and I didn't die but it looked like the back of my thighs. This is why I also whip cottage cheese smooth, the thought of eating something resembling the hated part of thighs (well, poultry notwithstanding) just yeah.. no.\n\n\nTalked to my chef brother Steve  about it and he at least laughed at back of my thighs comment. Said Keto would get rid of that problem, but I will have my baguette pried from cold dead hands! CARBS OR DEATH! \n\nI asked if non dairy would have same effect and said a higher fat milk like coconut milk could have same problem.\n\n\nLessons from Steve: \nMilk has fats, and proteins and if you boil it or simmer it aggressively (angry soup boiling to go with my anger typing sounds, I do love a good mashing sound of the keyboard ) It may break. Also adding acids can break it. It's how we get cheese. Iean ok yeah I knew that about cheese \n\nFixes if I really want pretty non cellulite looking soup: \n\nIce it. Bring soup up to warm and add a bit of oil, drop ice cube in there and stir whisk soup .DO NOT BOIL\n\nStrain off the solids from broth and blend it back together.\n\nPrevention is key I guess here's his tips.\n\nAdd acids last. Salt at end. You can also try tempering like you would and egg.   Use high fat milks ( I do!) Don't boil if adding coconut cream or regular milk. He says though that a roux or cornstarch slurry so proteins bind to that is best and Idk, he's no chemist so I'll research that. That sounds wrong.*",

A simmer is like 1 bubble breaking the surface every once in a while.  If bubbles are constantly coming up, that\u2019s a boil even if they\u2019re small bubbles.  Lots of people call that a simmer tho (like my gf) and think a boil is only when big bubbles are explosively shooting through the liquid (that\u2019s a rolling boil).",

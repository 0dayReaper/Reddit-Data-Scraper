Bottom was just soggy, pretty much breaking apart. I take the juices with everything that falls off and make gravy with it. For the top you can use a blowtorch to crisp the skin up.\n\nMy idea with this was just perfectly tender chicken in the least time and preparation possible. The skin does suffer for not being crispy. It's still well seasoned and edible because the fat renders out.",

Put the chicken into a saut\u00e9 pan that will fit it, and either truss the bird or cross in the legs and fold back the wings to make it a consistent shape for even cooking.\n3.\t\u2060Cook the bird for about 40 minutes, or until the breasts read ~160 on a probe thermometer. Pull it and let it rest for about fifteen minutes. Tent with foil to keep hot.\n4.\t\u2060Carve and enjoy. The pan can be deglazed with wine and stock to make a sauce.\n\nNow tell me that\u2019s harder than what you did and I\u2019ll eat a hat.",

If people are not in the middle of winter right now, they might prefer to use a recipe that doesn't mean the AC will have to be turned on. Some may not have a saute pan that is made for that amount of heat. Just because this recipe might return results that you prefer doesn't mean everyone is in a place in life where this would be easier.",

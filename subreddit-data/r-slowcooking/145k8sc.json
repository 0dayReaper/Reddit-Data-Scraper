It looks worse than it is and very minimal needs binning. Though I knew I was gonna have trouble because none of the recipes were for a 1.5 litre Slow Cooker. This only just fitted (2 cup flour dough) and most recipes were based around 3 cups+. I'd definitely cut the time back to under 90 minutes and to get a lighter coloured bread only cook on low. Overall though very pleased with my first attempt and will try again perhaps with another recipe. This one was a no knead but apparently kneading the dough properly will help it air up inside, so less like a cake loaf.",

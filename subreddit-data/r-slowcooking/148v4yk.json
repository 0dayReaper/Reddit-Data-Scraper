The most talked about is the tortellini/chicken/spinach one that\u2019s written out on that page.\n\n[Here\u2019s a variation of the tortellini soup](https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/145z0bd/aldis_take_on_the_soup/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1) that uses chorizo instead of chicken.\n\nOr just search \u201csoup\u201d in this sub for a great selection of options.",

            "comment": "There's this soup that a friend of mine (I think) came up with, and it's fantastic.  You can make it kinda with whatever ingredients you want, and the key at the end, but I'll list the way I usually make it:\n\nInto a pot of water (or sometimes I start with a bone broth base), add some crushed red pepper, and some fat (I usually use butter, tallow, lard, or olive oil in a pinch).  I then add all the ingredients in order of longest-to-cook.  Ingredients I often use include: mushrooms, squash, cabbage, onions, garlic, spaghetti noodles, kale, and whatever else I have around.  If I have it, I'll add sausage (fried and sliced) or even a ground beef or whatever.\n\nThen, once all the ingredients are cooked to your liking, you add abundant amounts of the three magic ingredients:\n\n* nutritional yeast\n* mustard\n* soy sauce\n\nThese three flavors just go well together and yield a soup that is usually well-liked, including by EVERY kid I have given it to (and you may know they can be notoriously picky).  Serve with sour cream, especially if it's spicy.",

Add tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes. Puree. Add heavy cream and heat through.\n\nSimple but amazing. Do not skimp on the heavy cream. It's only about a tablespoon per serving and makes the difference between good and bad soup. My only addition is a small onion, chopped, added to stock because I love cooked onion.\n\nEnjoy",

Cook all day on low or four hours on high. Add cooked rice or pasta in just before serving. I used to do this at work to use up veggies from my CSA box. The whole office smelled wonderful and everyone appreciated the free lunch. \n\nGood luck.",

Boil the cole slaw in the diluted chicken broth for about 20 minutes, until the cabbage is cooked. Toss in the wontons &amp; simmer until they float. Serve. \n\nSome of my favorites that take more time: beef &amp; barley; lemon ginger chicken noodle; chicken noodle; pea soup; and turkey noodle.\n\nEdit: forgot to add - thai red curry and chicken.

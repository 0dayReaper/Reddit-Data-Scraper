    "postText": "Hi! I work in a food bank and we're currently running a slow cooker project. I'm looking for recipes to suggest, but we're quite restricted with what we can suggest and provide - and ideally recipes should meet the following criteria:\n\n1. Do not contain anything that needs to be refrigerated - so, no fresh meat etc. Think tinned stuff, dried stuff, etc.\n2. The only fresh fruit and veggies we can really guarantee are 'robust' ones like potatoes, onions, carrots, apples. \n3. We have limited seasonings to give out - so things like salt, pepper, mixed herbs are okay, but if a recipe calls for obscure spices or herbs it won't work \n4. Obviously it needs to be things that are cheap, if possible!\n\nI'm UK based, if that impacts things.\n\nThanks in advance for your ideas!",

Mix well until all apples are coated.\nCook covered for 2 hours on high or until apples are tender.\n\n\nNOTES\n\nWhat apples should I use for Fried Apples?\nI love using honey crisp apples for this recipe. You can also try\nGranny smith\nFuji\nGala\nOr any other apple you have on hand \n\n*Brown sugar I make my own by adding 1 - 2 tablespoons of molasses to white sugar. Molasses is cheap and lasts forever. Also I've made this with 1/4 cup sugar only it's fine and since I know UK/ Europeans think we Americans use too much sugar ( we do ) 1/4 cup to 1/3 of white sugar or just the brown sugar if your apples are tart is probably fine.\n\nVanilla is pricey. Honestly Rosewater seems very twee here in the states, but vanilla for flavoring wasn't a thing until the mid 1800s. People used rosewater and orange blossom water for flavoring prior to the industrialization of vanilla orchid pollination. I can get a bottle of rosewater dirt cheap and too lasts forever and I just use that for a sub for vanilla at a ratio of 1 tsp to 1 tsp ratio. It works fine in cooked desserts and baked goods. If I'm on an extreme budget I save real vanilla for milk puddings and use vanillin ( imitation vanilla) for baked goods. Most people unless you tell them can't tell the difference anyway.\n\nButter-you need a little fat, so really anything would work except probably olive oil. I'm a budget cook so I'm not ashamed to use margarine or cheaper fat here.\n\nHow to serve Fried Apples:\nBreakfast: serve on or mixed into warm oatmeal\nDinner: served on the side with dinners like slow cooker cranberry pork loin or parmesan-crusted pork chops.  \nDessert: serve these on their own, on top of ice cream, or topped with whipped cream.",

It will come up with suggestions, and the recipes are actually pretty solid! \n\nWhen I poked around at it, this was its response...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure! Here's a recipe for Slow Cooker Lentil Chili that uses lentils as the protein source, which have a long shelf life:\n\nIngredients:  \n\t\u2022\t1 cup dried lentils, rinsed and drained  \n\t\u2022\t1 can (14.5 ounces) diced tomatoes, undrained  \n\t\u2022\t1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce  \n\t\u2022\t1 can (15 ounces) kidney beans, drained and rinsed  \n\t\u2022\t1 can (15 ounces) black beans, drained and rinsed  \n\t\u2022\t1 small onion, diced  \n\t\u2022\t2 garlic cloves, minced  \n\t\u2022\t1 tablespoon chili powder  \n\t\u2022\t1 teaspoon ground cumin  \n\t\u2022\t1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika  \n\t\u2022\t1/2 teaspoon salt  \n\t\u2022\t1/4 teaspoon black pepper  \n\t\u2022\t2 cups vegetable broth  \n\t\u2022\tOptional toppings: shredded cheese, sour cream, chopped cilantro, chopped scallions, tortilla chips  \nDirections:  \n\t1.\tIn a slow cooker, combine the lentils, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, kidney beans, black beans, onion, garlic, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper. Stir to combine.  \n\t2.\tPour the vegetable broth over the ingredients in the slow cooker and stir to combine.  \n\t3.\tCover the slow cooker and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours or on high for 3 to 4 hours, until the lentils are tender and the chili is hot and the flavors are well combined.  \n\t4.\tServe the chili hot, garnished with your favorite toppings, such as shredded cheese, sour cream, chopped cilantro, chopped scallions, and tortilla chips.  \nThis recipe is vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and budget-friendly, and the lentils provide a great source of protein. You can adjust the seasonings to your liking and add more vegetables if you'd like. Enjoy!",

I've always been told to avoid those too, but perhaps it's excess caution in my family.  Though I also suppose it depends on your canned beans and if you can be sure they were fully cooked as part of the process. Which may vary around the world. \n\nSorry to give you a scare.

            "comment": "Here my \"Fake\" and mushroom stew. (My wife is vegetarian so we can't use steak.)\n\nDice up you veg. Potato, carrot, onion are a must, celery can be added. Add to the slow cooker with water and a stock cube.\nAdd mushrooms. Dried work great, fresh are good, tinned are acceptable.\nYou can add a tin or two of mixed bean if you want to pad it out and add more protein. (Important to remember if you are using dried beans follow the instructions to the letter with prepping them. They must be soaked first overnight. Do NOT ever add dried beans straight to a slow cooker, you will have food poisoning.)\n\nIf you have a dark ale in the house, you can add a bit to the stew if you want.\n\nNow, the secret ingredient that nicks this up to 11. Marmite. Marmite is basically a super concentrated mushroom stock. Add a heaped teaspoon to the stew and it adds a super umami meat flavour without any meat being present.\n\nIf you want to stew to be \"thicker\" you can use a rue or corn stark slurry to thicken it (remember corn starch needs to be boiled before it thickens,) but that depends on how much time you have to tinker.",

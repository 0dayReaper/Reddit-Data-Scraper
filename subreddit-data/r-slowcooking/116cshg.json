    "postText": "Do slow cookers with multiple cooking levels like Low, Medium and High achieve these settings by having a single power output heating element and then use a thermal sensor of some kind to switch the heating element on and off to maintain temperature?  Like your furnace or AC, they only have one heat/cold output and its the thermostats job to regulate it.\n\nOr do they use some kind of factory-calibrated power output for each level, maybe more like an oven burner which actually outputs more thermal power as the dial is turned up.\n\nI never considered this but started to think about this morning, making a Barbacoa recipe which ultimately is going into enchiladas.  I didn't get it on until 8, and unless I wanted a late dinner it kind of limits my cooking time to about 8 hours.\n\nI was thinking maybe I could put it on medium for an hour to kind of speed it up and then the rest at low.  But if it uses a thermal sensor with a singular power output, that would accomplish nothing because it likely takes some time for it to get to the \"medium\" temperature and most of the time it would be cooking no faster than if it was on low.\n\nA cooker which actually put out higher power to the element at higher power setting would heat it up faster, thus accelerating the cooking process.\n\nI'd wager this might vary among cooker brands, so maybe there's no hard and fast rule.

            "comment": "I've never thought about it! How interesting.\n\nA general rule is that 4 hours on high is equal to 8 hours on low. And it reaches temperature pretty quickly. So if you needed it 10 hours on low but have only 8 hours, try a bit less than 2 hours on high, 6 hours on low.\n\nIf you're worried about the heating up time, just do the high temperature in the middle of the time.",

            "comment": "You could check the Kitchen Aid instruction book to verify, but I\u2019ve always thought that the settings on most slow cookers only determine how fast it gets to its cooking temperature. Eg. that the medium setting would end up getting to the same temperature as high, but would just take a lot longer.",

                    "comment": "I always assumed that the cooking setting (low/medium/high) was the actual operating temperature of the cooker over time.\n\nIt doesn't seem right that a cooker on \"low\" would get to the same temperature as one on \"high\", since the whole point of the slow cooker is slow cooking.  And over 8 hours of cooking time having the heating element on constantly and capable of hitting the high temperature, you'd overcook your food and hit the high temperature hours before the 8 hours was up.\n\nI looked at the manual and doesn't describe how it operates besides implying the high setting cooks faster.\n\nI guess the only way to really answer this question is to put a watt meter on the cooker and use a temperature sensor to see what kind of cooking temps it gets to on the various settings.  Not sure I care quite enough about this answer to do that much work.",

                            "comment": "Your assumption was incorrect. Traditionally slowcookers have High and Low. Internally there are two heating elements that run along the sides only. High adds the second heating element into the circuit. There is one bimetallic thermostat that cycles both heating elements at the same temperature. The purpose of Low is just to extend the cook time by slowing the heating up process. This was documented years ago through correspondence with Crock Pot.\n\n\nNew devices and digital programmable devices may work differently. It\u2019s easy to test and then you know what YOUR DEVICE does. Half fill with water and heat on Low until the temperature stabilizes. Turn to High and see if the temperature increases significantly (these are simple imprecise analog devices). Now you know.",

            "comment": "Slow cookers are power calibrated to achieve a certain cooking temperature when loaded with food according to the instructions. Meaning each setting outputs a set amount of power into the heating element. \n\nLow is only used to keep the food warm at a safe temperature. I think it's around 70ish Celsius. High setting is around 90ish. Medium is somewhere in between 80ish. \n\nSomeone correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nYou usually want to cook on high or medium, using high to speed up the cooking in the beginning of you want to switch to medium after.",

Low is an actual low, long time window cooking setting. \n\nI can see where constant power output per setting makes sense since it\u2019s probably cheaper from a manufacturing perspective than adding a temperature control circuit. \n\nThe problem would be the food load it\u2019s calibrated for.  Go below that and it\u2019s gonna run hot, below cold.  If you\u2019re the manufacturer it\u2019s probably in your interest to err on the side of a larger food load to avoid undercooking.\n\nTemp control kind of solves that problem as it could hold the designated temperature regardless of food load.",

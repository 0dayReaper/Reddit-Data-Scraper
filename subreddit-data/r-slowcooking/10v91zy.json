    "postText": "I got rid of my crock pot years ago and just purchased this small guy in December. With two kids (5 &amp; 7), their activities, working full time, a spouse with a weird schedule and trying to train for a half marathon I am finding it more and more difficult to make some easy meals at home that aren\u2019t Kraft Mac n cheese or chicken nuggets half the time.  I\u2019m sure this will be met with a little resistance from them, but today I put my foot down and say NAY to buttered noodles every other night!\n\nRecipe:\n\n1 1/2 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breasts\n2 large chopped carrots\n3 large russet potatoes\n2 celery stalks sliced\n1/2 cup salted butter melted\n1 Tbsp. minced garlic\n1/2 tsp. salt\n1/4 tsp. pepper\n2 tsp Italian seasoning\n\nAdded chicken to bottom of crock pot, then topped with potatoes, carrots and celery. Melt butter and add garlic, salt, pepper and Italian seasoning. Pour over the top, turn on low for 6-8 hours.  I also added a half cup of chicken stock to mine but I think that may be personal preference really. Really looking forward to getting back to some east slow cooked dinners!",

For me personally, I had to add something at the finish - I made a Dijon mustard cream sauce to pour over the top of the chicken using the liquid from the pot (about 2/3-1 cup of liquid, 2 tbsp Dijon mustard, a splash of heavy cream, 1/2 tsp Worcestershire and lots of pepper on the stove in a small saucepan, brought to a boil to reduce a bit).  I would recommend increasing salt if you don\u2019t have to watch your sodium intake. I\u2019ll make it again, but add onions and some more/different seasonings next time to up the flavor. Overall - my kids actually cleared their plates, so I\u2019d call this a win.",

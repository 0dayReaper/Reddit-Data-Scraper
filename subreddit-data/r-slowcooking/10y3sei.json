    "postText": "Hi all, I'm looking for a sauce to cook my meatballs in the crockpot but I'm looking for recipe/sauce ideas that AREN'T derived from a tomato based sauce (bbq sauce/ketchup/Heinz chili sauce) mixed w/ grape jelly.  I'm making meatballs for the Super Bowl but I don't want to do the classic.  The combination is absolutely terrific, but I find that it's always the go-to sauce for crockpot meatballs and I'm just looking for something a little different different.  Thank you!",

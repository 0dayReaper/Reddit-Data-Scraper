            "comment": "Beautiful! It's hard to believe that back in the day this was usually sold partly detached from the leg roast of the lamb, hogget or mutton and included with it as a little freebie. Or it was sold very cheaply alongside the neck chops, offal and other less popular meats as it was often considered \"poor food\". thrifty housewives would save them in the freezer for a rainy day budget stretcher or give it to the family or farm dog as a treat.  \n\nIt has been quite a chuckle to witness their discovery and rightful elevation to gourmet status. I always used ours because braised and finished with a rich sauce or gravy and mashed spuds as you did It's one of my all time favourite dishes. Another really nice accompaniment is a helping of swede (rutabaga) and carrot or pumpkin gently boiled until tender and then mashed with butter, salt, pepper and a bit of parsley.",

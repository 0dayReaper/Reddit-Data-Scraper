Also, I'm not trying to bash people for cooking because I think it's awesome that people cook at home instead of buying precooked storebought stuff. If you like the soup, that's awesome, and kudos to you for making something. But lets be real.. this soup is perfectly average. Imagine driving to your wedding in the rain. That is this soup.\n\n60% of the flavor is from the store bought, pre-made tortellini.  \n30% of the flavor is from the chicken you add.  \n10% of the flavor is from the other ingredients which are in just about every soup you will ever make.\n\n  If you love the soup, just buy the tortellini and save the effort and give it a bath in a better sauce. If you love the chicken, take your chicken recipe and add it to some pasta or some rice or something else. If you love the remaining 10% of the flavor, take it and do *literally anything else* and have a better soup.\n\nYou could modify this very slightly and not add tortellini and make a fucking incredible chicken [picatta-ish thing](https://damndelicious.net/2014/12/31/lemon-butter-chicken/)  that is 10000x better. Sub tomato shit for lemons, add capers, remove the slow cooker, keep the same amount of effort, and you have a masterpiece. Add rice if you're frisky, and you've got a date hooked for life.",

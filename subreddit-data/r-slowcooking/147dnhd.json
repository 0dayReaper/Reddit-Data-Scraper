After cooking chicken there\u2019s usually lots of grease/fat clumped around the bottom.\n\nBesides using paper towels to wipe it out, what strategies are there to more easily clean the crockpot after use? I live in a second floor apartment so I dont have a yard I can go out in and dump the food waste in too easily",

What I do is pour any leftover liquid into a container, put it in the refrigerator, and the next day there\u2019s liquid (juice) and hard fat.  Keep the fat!  It\u2019s great for frying things with, it\u2019s free, why waste it?  Use the juice for soup.  \n\nWhat little bit is left in the crockpot is easily washed out with a bit of soap.  Don\u2019t use those liners, who wants food cooked for a long time in a plastic bag?!  Plus then it\u2019s more landfill.",

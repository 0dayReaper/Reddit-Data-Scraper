Use something a little larger than what you\u2019re cooking because the surface area will crisp that rice a little and makes all the difference! Learned from experience",

Cook more rice than you think you need because if you don\u2019t have enough and you mix the gravy and rice there\u2019s no amount of cooking that will crisp them they will be over saturated. 2. Like I mentioned before use a pot with a large bottom surface area, if there\u2019s too much rice the bottom traps moisture and you can turn it continuously but it only helps so much. 3. When my rice is finished cooking I immediately remove it from rice cooker and spread it out on a baking tray so that the excess water evaporates. Mushy rice from the get-go will only get mushier.",

Eat the bacon,  but,  save some of the grease in the pot.\n\nAdd your rice and cook until lightly golden.  Remove rice. \n\nAdd your chopped veggies until slightly golden. \nDo not cook the garlic at the same time.  Too long cooking the garlic makes it bitter. A few minutes is fine. \n\nBrown your meats.\n\nPlace all ingredients in the pot or slow cooker.\n\nThen,  either cook in your slow cooker or finish on the stove. \n\nI make \"sweep the kitchen\" jambalaya. \nCrab, shrimp, ham,  chicken, and sausage.  Use the amounts of each that you'd like. \n\nJambalaya is hard to mess up.",

            "comment": "As a cajun, the squishy rice wounded me... but tbf that jambalaya is more creole than cajun. \n\nPro tips: chicken thighs are juicier and almost impossible to overcook, plus cheaper. If you're going to do the creole way, please use the trinity. Chicken and sausage is *the* best combo, and shrimp is common in creole jambalaya, just sort of not all at once if ya feel me. Please god please do not put cornstarch in your jambalaya. Google roux. It will change your life, and it's the base to A LOT of dishes, cajun and otherwise. Saut\u00e9 your veggies and meats (other than shrimp). You get more flavor that way, and once you're done you can throw your rice in to toast. THEN add liquid. The best jambalaya has a sacrificial layer of rice that's burned to the bottom of the pot. It's basically the barrier between the heat source and all the perfectly fluffy rice throughout the rest of it. It's important to note that jambalaya is not a soup, so it should cook more like a big-ass pot of rice than a soup. I could probably go on and on, but that's the basics that I think could help you a bit.",

My dad makes his jambalaya with a lot of mushrooms, so you could start there! There are mushrooms that can substitute chicken and seafood, just whatever you like. I would sub chicken stock for veggie stock, and don't forget to season the hell out of it. The mushrooms should make it very umami and satisfying imo",

Even tofu with the right spices can be a good substitute in these dishes.",

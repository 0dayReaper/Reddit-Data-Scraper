Slow cooker breads only take 2-3 hours total - if you start it before you'll go to bed you'll wake up to a burnt cracker.  (you'll also need a dough that can be left out at room temperature safely for 4+ hours)",

You not only have to be able to set a timer, but for the timer to be delayed until that early our morning. I do not think one necessarily means the other, I suggest reading into the details of the item. I would be happy to help you, but I don\u2019t know how to read Japanese and your item listing is in Japanese!",

It may have been my yeast - recipe called for rapid but all I had was regular - I even doubled the rise time and put it in my oven on proof setting. The flavor was good tho and I was surprised the sides and bottom did brown up. Ilm probably try it again. \n\nAs to your question - the combo maker should work so long as it has a slow cooker setting. I don\u2019t see why it wouldn\u2019t.",

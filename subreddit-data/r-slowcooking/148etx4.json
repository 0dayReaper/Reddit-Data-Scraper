However taste wise Duck is one of those unforgiving meats. Either way, you are going to have to cut it up to eat it, so why not just Hack the thing up, cook the dark meat/legs the crock pot for a proper confit? Take the breast and cook it properly, it is glorious because of the crispy skin. Have a nice meal. Enjoy. \n\nSlow cooker confit [slow cooker confit](https://www.mashed.com/466072/slow-cooker-duck-confit-recipe/)\n\nEasy duck breast - https://www.askchefdennis.com/pan-seared-duck-breast/",

You won't get the crispy skin which is so nice, but you could try finishing the duck in the oven for a while to brown it, or even removing the skin after it's cooked and crisping it up under the grill or in a frying pan. I would remove any excess fat that you can see, season it well, and maybe make use of an onion or carrot or something to lift it from the bottom of the dish. It's probably wise to check it every now and again to ladle out excess fat that might accumulate. Once it's cooked you can remove the meat and use it in your favourite recipes, or you can freeze it again if you wish.",

Here's a recipe you can try:\r  \n\r  \nIngredients:\r  \n\r  \n1 whole duck (approximately 4-5 pounds)\r  \n1 onion, sliced\r  \n3 cloves of garlic, minced\r  \n2 carrots, chopped\r  \n2 celery stalks, chopped\r  \n1 tablespoon dried thyme\r  \n1 tablespoon dried rosemary\r  \n1 tablespoon dried sage\r  \nSalt and pepper to taste\r  \nInstructions:\r  \n\r  \nStart by preparing the duck. Remove any giblets from the cavity and rinse the duck under cold water. Pat it dry with paper towels.\r  \n\r  \nSeason the duck generously with salt and pepper, both inside and out. Make sure to rub the seasoning into the skin.\r  \n\r  \nPlace the sliced onion, minced garlic, carrots, and celery at the bottom of your slow cooker. These vegetables will act as a bed for the duck.\r  \n\r  \nSprinkle the dried thyme, rosemary, and sage over the vegetables in the slow cooker. You can adjust the amounts of herbs according to your taste preferences.\r  \n\r  \nPut the seasoned duck on top of the vegetables and herbs in the slow cooker, breast side up.\r  \n\r  \nCover the slow cooker with the lid and set it to cook on low heat. Cook the duck for about 6-8 hours. The exact cooking time may vary depending on your slow cooker, so it's best to check the internal temperature of the duck.\r  \n\r  \nAfter the cooking time is up, check the internal temperature of the duck using a meat thermometer. It should read 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) in the thickest part of the thigh.\r  \n\r  \nOnce the duck is cooked, carefully remove it from the slow cooker and transfer it to a baking dish or roasting pan.\r  \n\r  \nPreheat your oven to broil. Place the duck in the oven and broil for a few minutes to crisp up the skin. Keep a close eye on it to prevent burning.\r  \n\r  \nRemove the duck from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before carving.\r  \n\r  \nServe the slow cooker whole duck with the cooked vegetables from the slow cooker and any desired side dishes like roasted potatoes or steamed vegetables.\r  \n\r  \nEnjoy your slow cooker whole duck!",

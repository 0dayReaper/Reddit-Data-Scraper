We h wait they do!!\n\nDid you ask ChatGPT to generate the most boomer-esque response imaginable?  Haha \n\nUsing modern kitchen appliances doesn\u2019t make your cooking less valid or make you lazy or anything like that.  It\u2019s just\u2026 using what\u2019s available.\n\nSame reason I buy flour at the store instead of growing and grinding wheat.\n\nIt\u2019s great to do things by hand, if one chooses to.  And many people who use modern appliances for some projects (when they need things done faster or in greater quantities) use more old world techniques for other projects.  \n\nBut saying that the future depends on people not buying kitchen mixers and doing so will somehow lead to \u201ckids looking to IG and expecting it to show up at door\u201d is silly.\n\nPlus, lots of people use them because they have difficulties mixing by hand.  So shaming the use of mixers can also be sort of ableist.\n\nYes, I know, it definitely sounds like I asked ChatGPT for the most millennial response to your comment.  Haha",

It's very useful.\n\nHowever, if you don't use it a lot, hand kneading is quite fine. Good exericise to mix in bowl by hand and  knead bread dough for a few minutes using heel and knuckles of hand. \n\nEven when you use a mixer, you will still want to take it out and knead the bread a bit, the ball of dough gets hard and can be a challenge for a kitchen mixer. (I used to make dough at a pizza place and our mixer was 6 feet tall and the dough hook was about 2 feet long, so....yeah).",

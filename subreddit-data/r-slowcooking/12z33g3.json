Instead it was creamy and just perfect risotto consistency. I added a handful of fresh spinach I tore by hand  and 2 tablespoons of organic lemon juice because I could catch my bus or stop at store for a fresh lemon. I also added more salt like a whole nother tsp and another tsp of oregano and mural of flavor. Lastly I stirred in 1/2 tablespoon butter into it to melt a bit and while  Fried diced  ham up in a little olive oil and butter. \n\nTopped it with manchego cheese, grated and some chopped green onions.\n\nThe carrots and celeriac root made it a little sweet, the mushrooms were great, and the green onions made it pop a bit. Glad I added the lemon it needed acid. \n\nSuch possibilities here. You could go spring and make it with thyme, white wine  and canned artichokes and stir in asparagus at end. Do all root vegetables or heck how about southwest with crisp fried  Mexican chorizo and red and orange peppers and lime?\n\nOf course you can add chickpeas and a mirepoix and keep it vegetarian. \n\nBut yeah definitely a keeper.",

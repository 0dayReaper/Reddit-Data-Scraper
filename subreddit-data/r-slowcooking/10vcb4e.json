I plug it into a smart plug so it comes on at 2am. This way any time between 6:30 and 8 am they\u2019re perfect. I\u2019ve been doing this for years and it never fails. I get the huge bag of quick cooking steel cut oats at Costco.",

            "comment": "Pot in pot is the way. It's Alton brown's method but basically your creating a water bath.\n\nI put steel cut oatmeal, milk + water dried fruits, nuts sand so forth in sprayed down deep oven safe bowl or pot that fits in my slow cooker. I cover the top with aluminum foil, sealing it well.\n\nI make a sling out of two strips of aluminum foil.lay one strip lengthwise in my slow cooker insert, and one width wise. Lower my oatmeal bowl in the insert. I then pour water around this bowl into the larger slow cooker until it comes about two thirds up the outside of the inner bowl.    Cover it all with the slow cooker lid. If my lid won't fit create a lid out out of more aluminum foil..\n\nTurn it on low, and go to bed.  Wake up to warm delicious oatmeal, no burned spots or dry areas.\n\nIf you want you can put the ingredients in mason jars and then do the water bath.\n\nHere's the ideas:\n\nhttps://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-detail.asp?recipe=512268\n\nhttps://www.cookingchanneltv.com/recipes/alton-brown/overnight-coconut-oats-reloaded-8670507",

It will NOT be cooked after the 2 hours, it needs the 6 hours on warm to finish cooking. \n\nPerfect every time! Not gluey, doesn\u2019t stick to the inside of the pot, just perfect oatmeal.",

It could be that the recipe is fine and it's just not your thing?\n\nOr gluey sounds like possibly too much water penetration. Maybe cut back on salt, which facilitates osmosis.",

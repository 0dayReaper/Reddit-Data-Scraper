    "postText": "I wanted to meal prep sesame chicken or sweet and sour chicken in the slow cooker. Can I just take the store bought sauce and throw it in with the chicken  in the slow cooker on low for like 6-8 hours. \n\nMy biggest fear is that the sauce will somehow reduce or carmalize but will the moisture from the lid being on counter act this?",

When it's done, I drain almost all the liquid from the crock, then add the rest of the undiluted sauce and let it come up to temp.",

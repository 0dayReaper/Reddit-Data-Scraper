If I get some Lasagne sheets I can do the white sauce in my round slow cooker and the mince/tomato sauce in my oval one put it all together in my rectangle one haha lots of washing up but worth it if it works well.\n\nI've not been brave enough to try Lasagne till now maybe this is just the right time.",

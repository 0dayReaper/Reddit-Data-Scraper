I\u2019ve only checked about five different places, but the consensus seems to be that if you\u2019re barbecuing you do fat side up and if you\u2019re slow cooking, you do fat side down. \n\nPersonally, I like putting the fat on the bottom to have it nicely rendered, the thing always juices up so much that it\u2019s practically engulfed in its own fat and juices by the time I pull it anyways. But the trick is, 30 minutes before you pull it you go in and tear it up real quick into the shredded pork that we all know and love. And then the coup de grace, slap it in the broiler until you see the very top part lightly brown.",

It produces plenty of liquid and when you don\u2019t have other liquid in there, the meat can\u2019t swim in the fat as it cooks. Just makes the meat slow cooked like it should be.

I already forgot what I'm talking about since I'm on the app. There are some things I'd do differently seasoned the meat and probably score it first.

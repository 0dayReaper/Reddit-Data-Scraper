Try to keep the hanging clothes away from the cooking area.  Also, a spray like Kanberra is good to remove odors. I spray it on my fabrics, like curtains &amp; couches.",

This circulates, condensing on the colder part of the vessel and evaporating on the hotter parts, while remaining overall the same amount.\n\nOf course there is condensation and evaporation. These are balanced, or there would be significant pressure inside (or a vacuum).\n\nAs the temperature rises, water vapour evaporates till it forms much of the air in the pot (40%, for example at 75C). Only this amount of water evaporates without recondensing. For a couple of litres of space above the food in the pot, for example and 75C, this means you need about a litre of steam, which at this temperature needs 0.6 grams or so of water. \n\nThere is not - as there is with a pot with freer access to the air any significant net boiloff of water taking flavour compounds with it.",

Cook with/near an open window\n2 if cooking something particularly smelly, put on a fan that will propagate the smell towards the window\n3. Clean up immediately after (dishes etc.) and put food into containers (not left in pans or bowls)\n4. Put all clothes away - even coats and bags that may be hanging up\n5. If you have a separate kitchen - close the door when cooking and until the smell has cleared\n6. Once clean- have an air freshener (sprays etc. - I burn incense)\n\nAs people have said - put your slow cooker on the balcony/outdoors.",

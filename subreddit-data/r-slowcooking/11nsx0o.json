Do I miss something that would make me regret it? Or would everyone say \u201eyes, Insta is superior to crock\u201c anyways?\n\n// edit: thank you kind people, I\u2018ll keep it \ud83d\ude0a",

I typically use the Instapot  \u201cmedium\u201d slowcooker setting if a recipe calls for something to be on crockpot low setting. Even then, sometimes I still have to add some time to Instapot for meat dishes and such. Hope that makes sense!",

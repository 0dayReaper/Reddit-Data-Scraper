    "postText": "Maybe this is crazy, but I love the flavor of Tom Kha Gai soup but don't really feel like making soup for logistical reasons for my lunches next week. So I wondered if I could turn it into a lentil stew.\n\nI found [this recipe](https://40aprons.com/slow-cooker-tom-kha-soup/) and I feel like it could be adapted into a lentil stew, but I'm very much not experienced enough to think through the adaptations myself without fully just guessing. Anyone have ideas?",

Very hearty, holds good texture as it sponges liquid, 1C per gallon of soup will get a very thick hearty soup.\n\nIf you want to just thicken it - corn starch slurry. Just don't use too much or you'll end up with tom kha gai gravy.",

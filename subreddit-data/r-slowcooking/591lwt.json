The dollar is weak right now, so cdn prices would be significantly cheaper in us money. $2-3/lb is a reasonable price for ground beef here. \n\nKeep in mind that cost of living (and cost of everything) is more expensive in Canada due to long, very cold winters, trade tariffs on imports (we're a small country in terms of population and don't have nearly the manufacturing &amp; agricultural infrastructure that the US does) and long travel times for any consumer good means that prices will always, almost across the board, be higher in Canada. \n\nBut, wages are generally higher in Canada to reflect the higher cost of living, minimum is much higher, outside of the largest cities homes are still very affordable, and health care is cheap or free (in terms of personal budget, taxes are much higher here because of that, but the cost of the health care system is spread more equitably across the population). This all means that you can't really compare prices between Canada &amp; the US like this. Our personal budgets are split up diffently. We pay a lot more for food &amp; consumer goods, a lot less for things like health care, mortgages or rent, and child care (and again, someone in Toronto or Vancouver will contradict me on this, but yes, there are still relatively cheap places to live in Canada) ",

Milk for example, is intended to be expensive in Canada as a way to ensure Dairy farmers remain profitable.  Therefore every food that includes a milk-derived ingredient is similarly expensive depending on the amount contained.  There is a knock-on effect to beef prices as well.  Another well-known one is the syrup cartel in Quebec that maintains the famous \"strategic reserve\", again as a means of price control.\n\nSimply put, we have more rules and intervention in our food.  Which can be both good and bad.",

I'm getting pretty sick of burros (burritos made  with chili and some other stuff) I had replied in a different comment that the only way I can get away with it is because food is just fuel to me, and I wouldn't eat if I didn't have to. But a lot of people wouldn't be happy campers living like I am now. \n\nI'm only budgeting like this because I'm going into an expected seasonal layoff, next month I'll be spending more.  \n\nBut yeah man nothing gourmet is happening in this apartment haha",

Big ole glass of V8 juice. Be around 2 bucks or less. I forgot the math on the chili and it really depends on serving size.\n\nHonestly I'm only eating like this because I'm about to go into my expected seasonal lay-off. I don't get nearly as much meat as I'd like, and it's not nearly enough calories to lift on, but I make sure to have a variety of supplement shakes and vitamins etc to ensure I'm not killing myself. \n\nBut yeah dude I can make enough burrito mix to last me 2 meals a day for 3 or 4 days for around 5 bucks? Same thing with potato stews etc. ",

I don't know if I could ever go back to eating the half rotten shit available at Sobeys or Dominion.\n\nBut other than the quality Newfoundland has some serious food supply issues, growing only 10% of it's produce. Which also means that if the ferries and boats stop running there's less than 72 hours of fresh food stock on the Island. It would be nice to see some investment (and possibly economic growth) in food security by employing smart growing techniques, like hydroponic or aquaponic grow systems. Use some of the vacant buildings (like the old dominion on Newfoundland drive and torbay road) as factory farms!\n",

Now we still didn't get top priced cans of food and went with the rather no name brands, same goes with the frozen items. \n\nSo I broke down the receipts and it was still way less then I thought it would be; $251.00 Canadian. We apparently bought more groceries then I thought that was not on the list. Again this is not the cheapest this could be done for. I'm positive I could if being really cheap acquired this list over a two week (two different set of flyers) for at max $200.00 . But keep in mind here we really don't have a farmers market, especially not this time of year and our food costs are pretty high in this province as apposed to the rest of the country.  \n\nBut all things considered you could double up these recipes for your family of 6 even at this price of 250 CAN converted to USD is about 185.00 doubled 370.00 and still have a lot left over for snacks/breakfast. As you could use especially with the older ones and yourself the extras for lunches. ",

So what I did the second month was prepped all of my vegetables for each dish, froze them, and then put them in a later point in cooking to avoid the mushiness. It turned out a lot better but it still got boring eating the meals everyday. I don't know why, they were different recipes but by the end of the month I found myself struggling to make them instead of going to the grocery store and just buying some spaghetti or stuff to to make a chicken meal.

They make a monthly meal plan, breakfasts and lunches are normally one of a few grab and go options, then dinners are preplanned for the whole month, but with constantly depending on day of the week, like Monday is Taco day, Tuesday is Quesadilla day etc, but changing the flavors for every new week. Rather than precook everything they take one day and like prepackage then freeze ingredients for the slowcooker, make 5 pizza doughs to freeze etc, that way all the dinners are just grab and throw in the slow cooker, or grab add prepackaged toppings and throw in oven etc. Seems like a very good system, she mainly does grocery shopping 1-2 times a month and bulk prep like this 1-2 times a month. Seems to work for them very well.",

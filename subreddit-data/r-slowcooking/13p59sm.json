I threw everything in the cooker in between things this afternoon. \n\n- 6 baby Yukon gold potatoes\n- 3 chicken thighs\n- 4 cloves of garlic \n- approx 1/4 bag of frozen pearl onions\n- a few handfuls of frozen spinach \n\nSeasoned everything with some olive oil, salt and pepper, Italian herbs, and the Georgian spice blend from Trader Joe\u2019s. I did brown the chicken on the stove before putting it with the potatoes but if I\u2019d had skinless I probably would\u2019ve skipped that step to save a few minutes. \n\nI cooked everything on high for about 3 hours (spinach was added in the last 15 minutes) and served with some bagged salad on the side. Turned out really good!",

I have particular taste right now for Brussels sprouts (no don't ask why). Broccoli, cabbage(any variety or color), carrots, peas, good lord, whatever you have to hand would go in this. \n\nSpicing is an art and not a science and is subject to personal taste I have found. Your dish, your spices. I could see Cool Runnings Chicken Seasoning going big with the thighs BC it goes great with chicken(go figure). Montreal Chicken Spice, which is somewhat like Montreal Steak Spice but for chicken, would add in nicely too. TBH they both work really well on plain veg too. Or noodles. Or rice. Or potatoes. 2 spice blends that just work so well, they fit with almost everything. \n\nThighs are such a great cut. The bones can be frozen and used to make stock later. The skin can be rendered to produce fat. The meat is so tasty and juicy it is a net benefit to any dish it is unlike breasts. For my money the best value protein source around these days. \n\nThanks f or your helpful post.",

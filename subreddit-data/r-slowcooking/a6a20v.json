Add the soups and do nothing for 8-10 hours on low. Shred. Toast your bread. Build your sandwich. Broil for a minute or two until the cheese is melted.\n\nHorsey mayo - 1 to 1 ratio horse radish and mayo. Mix.\n\nYou can take the leftover juices and reduce on the stove top to make an even better au jus.\n\n*I added giardiniera and it added a nice spicy crunch!\n",

I don't precook other meats like chicken, beef stew, etc. To me, that defeats the purpose. lol I use the crock pot for a one pot, easy meal. If I have to precook it, I may as well do it all on the stove.\n\nWait, I'm lying, I browned my sausage before. That's because I like my sausage sauteed a bit before just adding to the rest of the meal. Kind of a pain though, so I usually do it on the stove. One pot lazy meal kinda thing.",

A super dark roux gives you so much flavor for about 15 minutes worth of work.  Make a really large batch and freeze it up. According to Google it lasts for 6 months.  Is equal parts flour and oil which you cook down to make a paste. The lighter it is the more liquid it holds and it makes gravies and the darker it gets the less it makes gravy but the more flavor it adds.",

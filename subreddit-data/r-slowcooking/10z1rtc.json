I would love to know how it comes out for you. I have a breast of chicken to add to mine, and thought to pour in a white sauce at the end, but would love to hear how yours comes out before I commit.  \n\n\nOnly major difference - mine will not have carrots. I do not believe they count as food. My mother told me she would much up carrots and turnips when I was but a wee one, and I could still spit out the carrot.  \n\n\nI love turnip, though",

Green beans and potatoes are a pretty traditional combination here in the US, especially with a pot roast\u2026but I\u2019ll sometimes just make the veggies on their own and eat them this way without any meat.\n\nYou should share yours when you\u2019re done! I love seeing what people make with their slow cookers.\n\nThe seasoning blend is one I wanted to try from Trader Joe\u2019s because I haven\u2019t used it yet. [This link](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/everything-but-the-leftovers-seasoning-blend-069241) gives more details about what\u2019s in it.",

My darling ex wife said she never needed a DNA test to see if our daughter was mine. She loves sprouts, cabbage and cauliflower - my three favourite vegs, which her mother and all her family despise. She grew up in mid-west US, so a certain amount of culinary culture clash happened :-D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave to figure out that seasoning. Thanks for the link, you did debunk my first thought that is might be like Aromat. I will ask my little one who will know. She knows Irish food and US, and easily translates :-) But she still won't let me cook rashers!",

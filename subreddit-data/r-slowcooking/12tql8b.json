    "postText": "I have never been much of a cook. I prefer using a slow cooker because it is more difficult to over or under cook something using it. I have cook a lot of chicken and beef recipes, but never one that is just vegetables. I usually cook chicken on high, because I feel it is safer and more likely to kill the bacteria. I usually cook beef on low, since the beef tends to come out more tender and with more flavor. But I have no real experience cooking vegetables only. I have been playing around with ChatGPT and have been asking it to develop recipes to try, and many of them are only vegetables. \n\nThis is one of the recipes it gave me.  \n \n\nMoroccan Chickpea Stew for Two\n\nServings: 2\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 cup canned chickpeas, rinsed and drained\n* 1 cup canned diced tomatoes, with their juice\n* 1 small carrot, peeled and diced\n* 1/2 small yellow onion, diced\n* 1 clove garlic, minced\n* 1/4 cup vegetable broth\n* 2 tablespoons golden raisins\n* 1 tablespoon olive oil\n* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n* 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander\n* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n* 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger\n* 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric\n* 1/4 teaspoon paprika\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* Fresh cilantro or parsley, chopped, for garnish\n* Optional: cooked couscous or rice, for serving\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In the slow cooker, combine the chickpeas, tomatoes, carrot, onion, garlic, vegetable broth, raisins, olive oil, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, ginger, turmeric, paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine.\n2. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or high for 3-4 hours, until the vegetables are tender and the flavors have melded together.\n3. Taste and adjust the seasonings if necessary. If desired, serve the stew over cooked couscous or rice.\n4. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro or parsley before serving.\n\nNutritional values per serving:\n\n* Calories: 340 kcal\n* Protein: 9 g\n* Fat: 11 g (Saturated Fat: 1.5 g)\n* Carbohydrates: 52 g (Fiber: 9 g, Sugars: 17 g)\n* Sodium: 560 mg\n* Potassium: 850 mg",

There are several really good vegetarian slow cooker cookbooks with which I think you'll be more successful. Or get recipes off good recipe sites on the internet.   (By good I mean, recipes that are well tested and accurate).",

Most of the recipes I have used have come from legitimate recipe websites. I was curious what it could do. It came up with some that sounded really good, some that I have already seen, and some that I would not be willing to try.",

That's good for the \"Oh, good I see hell arrived\" days of summer when ovens shouldn't be turned on and standing over a hot stove is torture \n\nI like to cook beets in my slow cooker, I posted a recipe a month ago on that \n\nAlso, your AI recipe, those spices might need to increase a bit. Slow cooking can muddy flavors a bit. Sometimes I'll use half the spices at the beginning and then add the rest about half an hour before serving.",

(Curry).\n\nWhite bean and kale soup. Black bean soup.  Quinoa vegetable soup. All the yummy soups! \n\nButternut squash or pumpkin works well. For soup, curry, stews. \n\nRoot vegetable stew (root veggies, thyme, water, it cooks down into a lovely stew).  \n\nVegetable chili, of infinite kinds.  \n\nI don't try to make stir fry type things, that's not what the slow cooker is for.  But if you want silly soft veggies, it's perfect. \n\nMost veggie dishes take 4-6 hours in a slow cooker.  You're just combining flavours and softening vegetables.",

If I feel up to it, I might sautee or broil up the leeks for a more caramelized flavor but I probably won't. These days due to some personal issues if it's more than a few moments at the stove or insane prep work I'm won't do it and I'll  just eat the can of Pringles for dinner instead.",

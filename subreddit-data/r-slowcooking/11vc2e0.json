    "postText": "Title says it all. They are in the crock pot right now along with the peppercorn packets and enough water to cover them. It\u2019s pretty full. Ideally I would like this to cook for 12 hours or longer but I think they might be dry after that long. This is for family tomorrow. \n\nP.S., I realize this is probably not the ideal method but it is the easiest and most convenient method right now in order to have these prepped for tomorrow.",

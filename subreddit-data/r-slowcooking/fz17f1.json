It\u2019s a dark thick black color sauce, made by caramelized coconut sugar, for color, very mild taste\n- green onion for garnish \n- thai chili pepper (optional)\n\nI cooked this on high for about 1 and a half hour to 2 hours, then put it on stove mode (if you have it, if not just throw it on a pan on the stove) and cook on high til it reduces the sauce and make it a little thick, usually about 5-10\u2019. If you don\u2019t feel like thickening the sauce, you can just leave it like that and eat as is. With rice is the best!",

I've also had great luck with using fresh coconut juice to bring it up a notch.  The caramelized sauce \"nuoc mau\" can be made very easily with just sugar and water.  It's a good skill to have because it leads to making delicious caramel sauce.  I'd always pair this dish with winter melon soup with shrimp as it balances out the saltiness.  Cheers!",

In the US, if you look closely, the majority of brands of canned foods will say something about \"BPA-free liner\" somewhere on the label. It's usually not prominent because being BPA-free is mandatory, but I suspect they're required to say it anyway. In Asian markets (in the US), the import brands that don't use BPA tend to display it more prominently on their packaging, since it becomes a legitimate selling point for anyone who knows to care about that.\n\nEdit: apparently Aus/NZ have not banned BPA in food packaging, only in baby bottles. FSANZ decided there is a 'safe level' of BPA they've allowed in packaging, which the EU, US, and Canada do not agree with. Australia pushed for a voluntary reduction in the use of BPA, and some producers did phase it out, but it's not banned.",

Love it that way because the texture is fun and the eggs actually pick up even more flavor.\n\n\nSending you love from across the globe (well I\u2019m guessing you are not in Europe). I feel super warm in my heart to see one of my favorite dishes presented here, a little bit of home. So if it makes you feel any better, know that you made at least one person very happy to see the food you created!",

I know it was mostly about the munch (which looks really delicious, absolutely a must try,) but I wanted to just say I\u2019ve also been feeling low and hopeless. I know what it feels like and just wanted to reach out a hand and say you\u2019re not alone. I know it\u2019s not much and wish I could say more but I hope you\u2019re doing alright. Much love friend",

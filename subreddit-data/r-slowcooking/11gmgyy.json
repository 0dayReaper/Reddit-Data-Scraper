I used a mix of homemade beef and chicken stock and added btb. Also replaced some of the cream with buttermilk and added hot sauce and lemon juice. \n\nI understand why those who may have followed the recipe to the t wouldn't like it, but their comments armed me with modifications that made it good for me and the family. 8/10\u2026 will probably make again",

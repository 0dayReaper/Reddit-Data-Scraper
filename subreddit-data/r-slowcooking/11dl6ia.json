            "comment": "My husband decided he wanted to do a pot roast \u201chis way\u201d in the crockpot. He put a whole unseasoned roast with who knows how many potatoes and filled it with water. Put it on high. And says it needs 24 HOURS. It is not seasoned or seared or anything. Just potatoes, water, and meat. What am I going to come home to from work tomorrow?\n\nEdit 1 (post is 1 hr old, pot roast on hour 3): I\u2019ve just received breaking news from my husband. There is one single OXO beef cube in the water. This is an 8L crock pot. Lord have mercy on that one little bullion cube. The pot has a layer of white foam on top.\n\nEdit 2 (post 3hr old, pot roast on hour 5): temp has been turned down to low (by husband as I am not interfering). Some of the meat is floating at the top.\n\nEdit 3: link to update with photo https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/11e2hmj/update_on_my_husbands_24hr_pot_roast_link_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nEdit 4: final update (sorta, there\u2019s a twist ending)  https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/11ef150/i_survived_my_husbands_24_hr_pot_roast_ama/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

Everything was tough, dry, and unseasoned.  I'd put a cup of water on my plate to try and rehydrate it along with a mound of salt and pepper.  The chicken breasts were baked for 120 minutes at 350f.\n\nTurns out everyone secretly hated it.  Mom only made it because dad would make a stink if it wasn't dry enough to be used as kindling.  Dad like it because his grandma used to make it that way.\n\nI thought I hated all three and never made them until I was maybe late 20s.",

Your husband's cooking sounds a lot like my friend's mom's cooking (I've heard someone describe her cooking as cafeteria food and it's a surgically-accurate way to describe it lol.) She will warn guests about her cooking being \"too spicy\" because she used a pinch of black table pepper in it. Is your husband also from the Midwest?",

Always the one least suited to the task. He was fascinated the first time he saw me break down a brisket. He could make some awesome smoothies and a perfect French omelette, though, and I always praised him like I would a child who'd just used the toilet for the first time.",

Does he say it in a funny voice? \"The milkshake maker!\" When our blender broke and I bought an immersion blender, Mark thought he'd died and gone to Heaven. Really ramped up the smoothie game. He was making a couple a day, during the first days of the Plague. We were a little alarmed when our regular clothes didn't fit when we both went back to work. :)",

Though he is not anymore, he was brought up super religious, and his parents were against anything that might cause \u201ctoo much\u201d pleasure. And I think this is one of the things that has stuck since childhood. Extra seasoning is just wasteful and unnecessary. Like eating meals is just a thing you do to stay alive, you don\u2019t have to enjoy it.",

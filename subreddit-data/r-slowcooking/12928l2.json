I think it\u2019s a bit of a sore subject because OP posted the before and the top comment was suggesting this would turn out mushy. Specially because it was prepared in a slow cooker, which I think is unfair. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/128ndwz/ratatouille/jejmh98/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1&amp;context=3\n\nI read the original recipe and it called for discrete layers of veggies and sauce, and to me that made it enough like ratatouille to be worthwhile. \n\nI\u2019m adding this one to my weekly rotation and trying it out!",

Brown the chicken and season a bit as you go. Put chicken in slow cooker. \n\n2. Heat oil or butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and chopped onion and saut\u00e9 until onions are transparent. \n\n2. Add the cream. chicken broth and then white wine slowly. Bring to a gentle simmer, then set heat to low and simmer for about 10 minutes. The sauce should thicken enough to coat the back of a spoon.\n\n3. Meanwhile, place the chicken thighs at the bottom of the slowcooker lightly with Italian seasoning, crushed red chili pepper flakes, sea salt, and black pepper. Top chicken thighs with sun-dried tomatoes.\n\n4. When the cream sauce is ready, lower the heat and whisk in the Parmesan cheese, little by little until smooth. Adjust seasoning for the cream sauce if needed.\n\n5. Pour the cream sauce evenly over the chicken thighs in the slowcooker. Try to get as much sauce as possible on top of the chicken thighs and less on the bottom.\n\n6. Cook for 3-4 hours on HIGH or 6-8 hours on LOW. \n\n7. Turn the crockpot on HIGH if it isn\u2019t already. Add the chopped spinach to the crockpot and stir for a few minutes, until the spinach wilts.\n\n8. Serve over egg noodles, polenta or rice.",

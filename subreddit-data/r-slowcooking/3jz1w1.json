It's probably something that will need to be addressed by the mods if it gets to be a problem because everyone will have a slightly different definition of what \"quality content\" is, and without explicit sub-wide statements on what is and isn't acceptable in the sub, you'll always have people voting with their arrows. \n\nBut then again, the more mod control, the less organic the discussion quality will be. Look at a sub like ask historians, which has very good, carefully controlled responses to ensure the academic quality of the responses, but some questions just can't be answered because no one has the right academic credentials to address it. \n\nI think obviously a sub like slow cooking doesn't need rigid moderation, but it may be time to remind everyone of a basic, acceptable rule like \"be friendly, this isn't rocket science (or the Holocaust) that we're talking about here.\"",

It breaks the peptide bonds of amino acids, which is what protein consists of. \n\nBromelain is completely neutralized at 158 F, and the average crock pot takes about [1.5 - 2 hours](http://www.ar15.com/media/mediaFiles/38579/44577.JPG) to reach that temperature.  Since the enzymes are inert when frozen, the meat will only be tenderized for about 2 hours.\n\nThat being said, Bromelain is concentrated in the stem of the pineapple, and the canning process greatly reduces the Bromelain content.\n\nTL;DR - It should be fine.",

The problem is, there are SO many freezer meal recipes out there, I've been overwhelmed by the idea of sifting through all of them, reading reviews, picking the ones I want, etc. This post is AWESOME. I'm just gonna skip the picking and choosing and make the exact meals you made, thank you!! You've saved me a ton of work, these look delicious!",

Return chicken to crock along with heavy cream and gnocchi and give it all a stir\n\n8. If you want your sauce to be really thick then add the cornstarch slurry as well (if you'd rather have more of a soup, leave it out)\n\n9. Let cook for at least 15 minutes on high or up to 45 minutes until gnocchi is as tender as you would like it (I used the whole 45 minutes)\n\n10. Serve in bowls\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nChicken Philly Cheesesteak\n\nIngredients:\n\n\u2022 3 tablespoons corn starch\n\u2022 1 cup chicken broth\n\u2022 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into strips\n\u2022 1 large onion; sliced\n\u2022 3 bell peppers (the more colorful the better), cut into strips\n\u2022 1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n\u2022 1 clove of garlic, minced\n\u2022 6 slices of provolone cheese\n\nDirections:\n\nMix corn starch into chicken broth.\n\nPlace all ingredients EXCEPT for cheese in crockpot.\n\nCook on \u201clow\u201d setting for 6 hours, or until chicken is cooked through and peppers are soft.\n\nLay cheese over mixture.\n\nCook on \u201clow\u201d for additional 10 minutes or until cheese is melted.\n\nServe on a fresh, hot roll.\n\n\n",

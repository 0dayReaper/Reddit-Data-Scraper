I wanted to show cheap hearty food we used to eat. And people calling something irish because it has Guinness in it can be an outdated stereotype. \nCan you imagine what this stew was like during the potato blight!",

Twas very flavoursome, but I was personally was disappointed in the potatoes needing to be mushed more. So you could adapt for SC and ad some maris pipers with the roosters. \nBut you won't need to if you put on the hob. \n\nIf anyone makes this please let me know here how it turned out and your review on it. And remember it not fancy, but it is very tasty.",

Basically, dried and ground up meat stock? Here in America, there's a brand of cooking utensils called OXO, and they don't make food, just things to cook with.\n\nI also imagine the \"knorr\" is a seasoning packet as well? Knorr is a brand of pre-packaged seasoned rice or noodles here. So, at least that food connection is easier to make \ud83d\ude05\n\nYour stew looks delicious by the way! Simple, and I like it! It's similar to the stew I make, but I do coat my stew meat in flour, salt, and pepper, brown it, and then put it in the crock pot. Personal preference I'm sure.",

Knorr is another season brand if you Google knorr stock pot if gives you an idea of what it is the stock pot is more of a small jelly like stock cube.You can use 2 dried stock cubes.\nAh yeah I do put salt and Pepper in this. You see this recipe fed a lot of families, and traditionally it was cooked in a cauldron over an open fire. Beef was the most popular used meet but it was also cooked with mutton or lamb. \nI was just trying to show people an authentic Irish stew. There is lots of variations, adding turnips, barely, etc. \nI have never cooked my meat in flour first because the potatoes are the secret behind thickening it up. My mam used to tell me to more potatoes in a stew that I felt had too much lol",

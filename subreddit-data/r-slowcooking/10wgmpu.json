    "postText": "I'm looking for recipes that are along the lines of braised in a red wine sauce/gravy. Basically I want it rich and savory not sweet. Anyone got anything good up their sleeve? I was going to wing it this weekend but figured I'd look to my slowcooking peers for guidance. I have 4 pounds in the freezer waiting for Saturday morning.",

            "comment": "You do them like you braise short ribs. Season your ribs, brown them then remove from pan. Saut\u00e9 your Mira poix ( chopped carrots, celery and onion) then add minced or chopped garlic along with salt and pepper. Add some tomato paste (Maybe 2 Tbl.) caramelize. Then add a red wine you would drink NOT SWEET, dried thyme, a couple of bay leaves and beef stock. Nestle your ribs into your liquid and cover with a tight lid or foil tight on your pot. Put in an oven at 275 for 4-6 hours.  Then take from the oven and he remove the ribs and the bay leaves. Then blend using an immersion blender or a regular blender using the proper guidelines for blending HOT a foods! I use an immersion blender then run mine thru a fine strainer. You can then adjust your sauce for salt, pepper, wine etc. if you add wine simmer for a few minute to burn off the alcohol then put your ribs back in it. \n     Sometimes it needs acid (often) take a spoon of your sauce and add a drop of red wine vinegar and see if that corrects it.  Then you know. You can use red, white or balsamic to add acid. Just know balsamic will also add sweetness",

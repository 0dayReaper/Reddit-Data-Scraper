            "comment": "An ode to the Brothers Grimm - in reference to the Black Forest in which all their fairytales were based. I would stare at Black Forest Gateau in awe as a child visiting the local bakery / cake shop. I noticed today Cadbury chocolate on 'special' and as usual the Black Forest flavour was pummeled. So grabbing one of the last packets I couldn't help to also make use of some 'quick sale' (best before tomorrow) Hot Cross buns. I'm not sure about everywhere else but here they start selling them in February and still to this day. New Zealanders will actually call talkback Radio and complain that they should only be for the Easter celebrations. On top of that I stumbled upon a bag of Candy Floss. So Halloween ensued.\n\nThis recipe is by no means intended to be taken too seriously. It was completely experimental - forgive the inclusion of Almond Meal and the vanished Ice Cream.\n\n2 Hot crossed buns (\ud83d\ude44) \n\n\u2153 Cup water (ad-lib) to mash buns\n\nCup of Corn Flakes - mortar &amp; pestle\n\n\u00bd Cup Almond Meal\n\n\u00bc Cup Linseed\n\n4 heaped tbsp Raw Sugar\n\n1 tsp Mace\n\n1 Banana mashed and mixed all together\n\nMargarine to coat the Slow Cooker. Topped with 4 crushed biscuits. I used chocolate Oki-Doki any are fine. The rest is visible above - Candy Floss and Black Forest chocolate. It reminds me of Rocky Road though also Neopolitan Ice Cream. Cooked on high for 60 minutes. The top definitely didn't need any more cooking yet the mix was somewhat undercooked. It didn't matter because all ingredients were edible as is. \n\nThe other option was to find a banana loaf type recipe and supplement the ingredients in to get a more cake like result but I decided I just wanted to make it how I wanted. Overall it wasn't bad - we all scream for ice cream. Have a nice night. \ud83c\udf03",

The cookies / biscuits are very similar to Oreo, they're an Indian export so perhaps if you are aware of an international food shop / section they may have them.\n\nThe Candy Floss is Cotton Candy, though the chocolate I get you. They sell it in the U.K. too but not U.S.",

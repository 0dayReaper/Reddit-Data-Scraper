I want to start meal prep for a beet salad and a beet chickpea stew for the weekend and don't want to waste my precious at home time cooking the beets in the he oven. Hope that satisfies the \"shoulda cooked it in the ...people out there.\" \n\n\nOkay on to recipe: Cooked in 3 quart slow cooker\n\nTwo medium beets, peeled and greens and roots chopped off. If extra large cut in halves or trim to fit your slow cooker.\n\nOlive oil ( no exact measurement perhaps 1/4 cup)\nGenerous amounts of pepper, salt, dried dill and thyme. \n\n2 shallot cloves, peeled or  ( it's like garlic gloves you can break it off in chunks - see comment for other options) \n\n2-4 garlic gloves peeled\n\nTear off two sheets of aluminum foil large enough to wrap your beets. Place beets on each sheet, coat in olive oil and sprinkle all sides with dill, pepper, thyme and salt. Wrap tightly to help prevent leaks and the beet juices caramelizing and burning in your crock. you can add 1/4 cup of water on bottom to help catch the drips and steam the beets a little. \n\nCook on low for 5-6 hours. Remove and serve as side dish or use in other dishes.",

I just took them out and I'm happy with the packets. \n\nAlso, the shallot and garlic are optional but I wanted them to be steamed cooked also for use in dressing for my salad. It's nice to have some sorta roasted* alliums on hand. \n\n* Sorta roasted because obviously the slow cooker can't roast garlic or shallots/ onion but it does well enough and it takes two minutes on my foreman grill or broil  to get a char and Maillard reaction if they've been pre cooked in the slow cooker. Plus flavor for my beets!",

You can just chunk off a bit of onion if you want. I had a shallot so that's what I used.\n\nMeal prep plan:\n\nOne beet is going in a Greek style barley salad with mint, parsley, feta cheese and chickpeas for my work week..\n\nThe other may go in a creamless ( basically a potato beet soup) soup or I may make a hash or add it to some homemade hummus. I may just eat with a poached egg on toast for breakfast on Sunday. Haven't decided yet.",

They\u2019re actually baked (not *slow cooker,* I know, but low and slow) then they HAVE to be chilled before getting sauced and grilled- otherwise they fall apart. So good\u2026\n\nTHIS is a great idea, though. I\u2019ve always wanted to do fried chicken at home but I\u2019m super paranoid about not cooking it through. This method removes the worry. Thanks!",

Between the cooking and vinegar in the dressing, the meat is literally falling off the bones at the end. Almost too much so.

Give it a bit on the cooling rack to stop cooking. Then put in a 350 oven (still on the rack for crispiness) with thermometers in the breasts and thighs. I pull the breasts at 150 and pull the rest when thighs hit 180. Perfect fried chicken every time!\n\n\nEdit: I lollipop my legs in this method to get the timing for legs and thighs more uniform and for added yum",

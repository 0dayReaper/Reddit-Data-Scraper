I should know this my mom was the most passionate gardener I know, I lost her last year and I realize how much I didn\u2019t listen and learn from her. If I were to Plant the soft onion after I use the greens As suggested what should I expect? IG I assume to get seeds in another year?? Also I\u2019ve heard a lot about trying to grow from store-bought vegetables and because they are highbred or what not that you may not get the results you expect is that possibly the case as well? Sorry for the long text\u2026 Guess I\u2019m just thinking out loud",

The seeds won't necessarily make exactly the same fruit, but might be close, or might be much different. Remember your Punnett squares from school? Even if the apples grown from a cutting were pollinated by the same variety, they might still come out too sour or tiny or a different color or what have you.\n\nAlliums, the onion/garlic/shallot/leek/chive family, aren't grown from cuttings, and will likely be very close from seed. Onions are self-fertile, but the male parts make pollen a few days before the female parts are ready for it, so you might have to keep a paintbrush on hand to pollinate.\n\nAnd to answer your question as to what to expect:\n\nIt'll put out little roots to draw up water and nutrients, you might be able to see little nubs on the bottom of the bulb. It really just needs enough moisture in its substrate to facilitate that, it doesn't have to be sitting in mud or anything. Until it's got lots of roots to draw up water, it will only be able to absorb a tiny bit by osmosis. Try not to let your onion stay too wet for too long or you might end up rotting it. If you get little fruit fly looking bugs (actually fungus gnats) coming out of the soil, it's way too wet for too long. If that happens, cut way back on the water and add Mosquito Bits (BTI).\n\nIt might spend some time doing that before putting out more greens, but it'll likely try to replenish some of its moisture and nutrients since it's been pulling it from the bulb all this time.\n\nEventually you'll notice the greens really start to take off, once it's established you can start taking up to 1/5th of its greens at a time. This takes water and nutrients though, so if it's not getting enough you might wither the bulb away to nothing over a long time.\n\nIf you notice a couple separate stalks, you might be able to (gently, no cutting) split the bulb into two bulbs like a head of garlic and reproduce it that way.\n\nIf it's really soft and smells bad, it may be too late, but it may just have used a lot of its water making those greens.",

I have seen this post a million times and I have to add something for potential new viewers\u2026 if you don\u2019t have a microwave, you can saut\u00e9 the onions until transparent, then add garlic and tomato paste, then add flour and 1/4 cup of broth (on low)\u2026 will thinken quickly and then dump into slowcooker and proceed with the rest of the recipe.\n\nIt honestly no more dishes than the proposed recipe (1 microwave bowl vs 1 pan) and a similar or less work option (imo, it\u2019s easier than pulling a dish out every 90 seconds)",

How you treat your onions is a big part of making soup broth, so I can't understand why you'd just microwave them rather than sauteing, unless it's for people who only have a slow cooker and a microwave and nothing else.\n\nOften friends ask me why a dish hasn't quite worked, and I'm like, how did you start with the onions?",

They last for years, decades, centuries, millenia so they are a good investment. Glass can crack but these plastic things go on forever.

Make soup a few times, freeze it in pints, and lunch is always ready from your buffet of soups. And do label what you put in your freezer otherwise you think you will remember but you won't.

I put the grill on sear and slice two white onions in half. I rub them and a head of garlic with peanut oil. Then the beef goes on the hot grill with the crock pot on the side. Only a minute or so a side, I just want to char the outside. Then the beef goes in the crock pot and I change the temp to medium. I start the crockpot and add beef broth, salt, pepper, and Lipton Beefy Onion Soup mix. \n\nThe grill is now cooler so the onions go on cut side down and the garlic in the back corner. When the onions are fully cooked, they and the garlic go in a bowl. I usually add some extras to the grill while it's hot, like broccoli spears cut in half with the cut lightly rubbed in peanut oil. Once the onions and garlic are cool, I put the onion cut side down on a cutting board. I can just pull up the outer layers and cut around the core. Then the garlic bulb is cut in half with a utility through the middle of the cloves. I can get the garlic out with a nut pick and squeeze out the rest. No need to cut it, it falls apart in the broth. \n\nWhen the beef is falling apart, I take out with a serving fork onto a plate next to the crock pot. I have a bowl for fat. I use a salad fork to shred off the beef while holding it with the big fork. I can pull off all the fat and toss it in the bowl while the shredded beef goes back in the pot.\n\nEnd result is lean, shredded beef in a rich roasted onion &amp; garlic broth. Just a small bowl is really good when you are sick.",

But I would think anyplace that sells them would be easy to find. I like the plastic containers that are square with straight sides so they stack and fit better in the freezer and use space more efficiently. Round sides waste a lot of space. I know some people freeze food in bags and I have seen (yesterday in fact) a gadget that holds the bag upright while you fill it and that was on a shopping site called TEMU (Chinese but their warehouses are in the US so orders come fast). They take PayPal and all shipping is free; a very fun site for dirt-cheap kitchen gadgets. BTW I do not work for them or anyone.*",

The point of the exercise is learning that making soup is easy, soup is delicious, and having soup ready in the freezer so that with ten minutes of zapping your meal is ready. Know this and your whole life improves. Right now I have a big hammy hambone in my refrigerator.  In my biggest soup pot I will put it, three pounds of dried split peas, and a whole lot of onions, celery, and carrots, a bunch of water, and salt and garlic powder. A low-grade Special Needs Collie Dog could do this. But thanks to the magic of cooking, these elements will turn into a huge supply of lovely split pea soup and my only problem will be finding enough freezer space. So if you don't care for the tortellini soup, don't knock it---just try making some other kind of soup, and freeze it for your future reference. Knowing how to make your own soup is a worthwhile endeavor. There will always be something good to eat and READY. Just do it.",

Usually I\u2019m pretty cautious with my calories and only eat between 1200-1500 daily.

And again because of the cheese issue we had to find a ravioli that wasn\u2019t coated with mozzarella etc. so we ended up with a crayfish ravioli. Which was unusual! But delicious. Chicken was melt in mouth. Sauce was thick and rich and fabulous.",

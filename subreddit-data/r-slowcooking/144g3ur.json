If you don't have a grill/smoker or the time for that, your best bet is to throw some seasoning on them, wrap them in foil, and bake them in the oven for ~3 hours at 250 degrees. Then remove the foil and brush with sauce, stick them back in on a low broil setting until the sauce gets a little blistered. Perfect every time, takes less than 5 minutes to prep, and pretty much set it and forget it just like a crock pot.",

I think BBQ sauce \"burns\" or something if it's in a slow cooker because it always has an odd taste after 8 hours. My new technique is to put a rub on the ribs, lightly brush over them with some liquid smoke, put them in the cooker with a coarsely chopped onion and add a couple of cups of beef stock. After 8 hours I put the sauce on and put them under the broiler for a few minutes.",

Finely chop stems, and roughly chop leaves.\n\n2 Tbsp tomato paste \n\n1 Tbsp Better than bouillon, your preferred flavor (I used mushroom base)\n\n2 bay leaves\n\n3 Tbsp chopped sage leaves (dried sage is fine too if you don\u2019t have fresh, just reduce volume to 2-3 tsp)\n\n1 lb dry lentils (I used brown)\n\n1 lb pork breakfast sausage \n\nSalt &amp; pepper to taste\n\nBrown the breakfast sausage in a skillet and break it up into little chunks as you cook it with a wooden spoon or spatula. When sausage is browned and cooked through, remove the sausage with a slotted spoon, leaving the grease in the skillet, and set aside.\n\nLightly brown veggies (carrots, onions, celery, and kale stems) in grease, adding a bit of oil or butter to the grease mixture only if needed, and add them to slow cooker. Next, add garlic slices, brown for about 30 seconds or until fragrant, and then add tomato paste to stop garlic from burning. Allow tomato paste to caramelize slightly (1-2 minutes) and then scrape garlic and tomato paste mixture into slow cooker.\n\nAdd lentils, bay leaves, sage, better than bouillon, and cooked sausage to slow cooker. Add enough water to cover all ingredients plus about 1.5 inches.\n\nSet slow cooker to 4 hours on high, or 8 hours on low.\n\nAdd kale leaves about 20-30 minutes before your timer ends. Taste, and adjust with salt and pepper to your preference.",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI made a lasagne in the slow cooker there\u2019s an awful sweet smell coming off it. My partner doesn\u2019t mind but it really puts me off and I can\u2019t eat it.\n\nI use mince beef, lasagne sheets, jar of white and red lasagne sauce, onions, easy garlic and peppers.\n\nI fry off the mince, onions, peppers and garlic and then add put it on low for a couple of hours.\n\nI was wondering if anyone has had a situation like this before?",

Like, literally make a cheese sauce using any and every cheese available, then layer that in...\n\nTry cooking your own 'red pasta sauce' from scratch too, makes it so much more satisfying... (Basically tomatoes (canned is fine) herbs and spices, red wine, many hours of slow simmer)",

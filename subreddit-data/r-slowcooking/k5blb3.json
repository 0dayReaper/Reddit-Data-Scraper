See below\n\n**Tacos de Birria**  \n\\* 2.5lb Chuck Roast  \n\\* 4 Dried Pasilla-Ancho Chiles  \n\\* 2 Dried Guajillo Chiles  \n\\* 8 Chile De Arbol  \n\\* 1 Tsp pepper  \n\\* 1 Tsp dried thyme  \n\\* 3 Bay Leaves  \n\\* 1/2 Tsp Ground Cumin  \n\\* 1/2 Cinnamon Stick  \n\\* 4-6 Cloves Garlic  \n\\* 1/2 Large Onion  \n\\* 1 1/2 Tbsp Salt  \n\\* 1/4 cup Apple cider vinegar  \n\\* 3 1/2 cups Water  \n\n**Recipe Instructions via @woodfireandwhiskey**\n\n* Remove the seeds and veins from the chiles and simmer for 5-10 minutes  \n\n\n* Remove Chiles and add all of your ingredients except the chuck roast to a blender to make the sauce. Use the same water you boiled the chiles in.  \n\n\n* Sear the chuck roast for 90 seconds on each side then add to your crockpot. Pour the sauce all over and set crockpot to high. This will take 4-6 hours. You want the beef to fall apart very easily. Add salt if needed. My version comes out a bit spicy.  \n\n\n* Serve how you\u2019d like. I made Quesatacos and they are now my favorite thing to make.  \n\n\n* This is how I made it and there are many recipes you can choose from online. For my first time making this, it was absolutely delicious!\n\nedit: grammar and context. also thanks for the silver and awards!",

So this won\u2019t be a standard recipe since I just do it from memory but here goes....\n\n- 8 New Mexican chiles\n- 8 Guallijo chiles\n- 1 garlic clove\n- 1/4 onion\n- teaspoon Mexican oregano\n- water\n- salt and pepper to taste\n\n1. Seed peppers and rinse them clean\n2. Toast peppers on the stovetop. Super quick. Don\u2019t burn them - just brown a little \n3. Throw the chiles into boiling water. Turn off burner and let chiles soak in hot water for 30 min\n4. Throw chiles, onion, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper into a blender. Add about half the Chile water in there - enough to blend the mixture but not so much that it looks super thin \n5. Put mixture through a sieve. It\u2019ll be kind of thick so you\u2019ll need a large spoon/spatula will help press the liquid through the sieve\n\nYou\u2019re done! Now use the sauce on scrambled eggs, pork, meat, or whatever else you have in the fridge. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s also YouTube videos if this recipe isn\u2019t precise enough! Good luck!",

She also provides instapot and stovetop recipes. \n\nhttps://inmamamaggieskitchen.com/slow-cooker-birria-de-res-mexican-beef-stew/\n\nSome notes:\n\nDon\u2019t burn the peppers. \n\nThis is not a spicy recipe. \n\nSometimes I don\u2019t have liquid/dissolvable bullion, and since I like a lot of broth with it, I just add a cup or 2 or beef broth. \n\nTo make the fancy dipping tacos:\n\nDip tortillas in broth, place on griddle (watch how the guy in the video does it\u2014took a couple times for me to get it right without destroying a tortilla hahah)\nadd melting cheese and beef, cook until cheese is melted and tortilla is browned. \n\nServe tacos with a cup of consomm\u00e9 (the broth), add diced onion and cilantro to taco. You can garnish the consomm\u00e9 with fresh tomato, onion, lettuce if you\u2019d like a little crunch. The broth is rich and savory, nice for sipping on a cold evening. \n\nFor cheese I try and buy Mexican melting cheese (queso asadero). You should be able to find that and the peppers at a local Mexican market/grocery. If you can\u2019t find the cheese any other melty cheese will work. I\u2019ve used mozzarella before haha.",

Commenting easy to read instructions:*\n## Birria Tacos Recipe\n## Ingredients  \n- 1.5 lb beef shank\n- 1 lb cab sirloin (or other roast/steak)\n- 3  dried guajillo peppers (see notes)\n- 1 can chipotle peppers in adobo\n- 1/4 cup vinegar\n- 1/2 cup crushed tomatoes\n- 5 cloves garlic\n- 1 tsp dried oregano\n- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika\n- 1 tsp cumin\n- 1  medium onion (chopped)\n- 1  cinnamon stick\n- 2  bay leaves\n- 6  whole cloves\n- chicken stock to cover (sodium free, about 1 quart)\n- 4\" corn or flour tortillas (as needed, 12-16)\n- 1  medium onion (chopped, optional)\n- 1  bunch cilantro (chopped, optional)\n- 1 cup mexican cheese blend (grated, optional)\n\n## Instructions  \n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and then remove from heat. Soak your dried guajillo peppers for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, cube your cab sirloin, then season both the steak and the shank with salt and pepper. Set aside.\n1. Add marinade ingredients to the blender. When the peppers are done soaking, hold them by the tip over the sink and use scissors to cut the stem off and allow the seeds to fall out, then add to blender. Blend the marinade into a smooth paste. Marinate the meats for a minimum of two hours or up to overnight.\n1. Set your Instant Pot on saute high or use a skillet over medium heat. Add 1-2 tbsp oil, then saute the onions until golden and translucent (6-8 minutes).\n1. Add the meats, marinade, bay leaves, cinnamon stick, and cloves to the pot. Cover with chicken broth, then set to high pressure for 45 minutes. If using a slow cooker or stovetop, set to low heat for 4-6 hours.\n1. When the instant pot is finished, allow a natural release, then remove the meat. Shred, set aside, and discard the bones.\n1. Warm up some tortillas, then dip the tortillas in the stew. Build your tacos, top with any optional toppings, then fry over medium heat on a nonstick skillet. Enjoy immediately, preferably with a margarita or cold Mexican beer.\n\nClick here to [view, print or save a simplified copy of this Birria Tacos Recipe recipe](https://www.getrecipecart.com/recipe/5f9080cb125ead64a25a0313)\n\n\nOriginal source: [Recipe](https://iamafoodblog.com/birria-tacos-recipe/)",

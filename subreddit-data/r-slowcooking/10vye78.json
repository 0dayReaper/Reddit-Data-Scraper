    "postText": "6 chicken thighs on the bone\n\n2 sweet potatoes peeled and diced \n\n1 yellow onion, peeled and diced. \n\n1 tin of chopped tomatoes\n\n4 cups of chicken stock\n\n1 cup of peanut butter\n\n1 cup of dry roasted nuts\n\nHandful of fresh coriander leaves \n\n1 bird's-eye chilli's (chopped) \n\n3 inch piece of ginger peeled and chopped finely \n\n6 cloves of garlic chopped finely \n\nMethod - brown the chicken in pan. Add to crock. Add the onion to the same pan, brown, add the potatoes, ginger and garlic and cook for 5 mins stirring repeatedly. Add to the crock, add the rest of the ingredients and cook for 4 hours on high or 6 hours on low. Remove chicken bones, shred the meat and stir back in. \n\nThis is a delight. The underlying heat from the chilli's is only apparent when it hits your belly. A real winter warmer.",

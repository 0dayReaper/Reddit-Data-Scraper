You basically get extra flavor when searing a piece of meat because of a chemical reaction between carbohydrates and amino acids. Also when searing meat you keep the juices within the meat, not as important perhaps when slow cooking but very important when you\u2019re only roasting the meat. Kinda why you also should let the meat rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing it as it will otherwise release all the juices, well most of it at least.",

I believe some meats in some techniques should be seared, but I'm not convinced it's doing anything for a pot roast in a slow cooker.",

I\u2019ve never seared it and my mother didn\u2019t growing up, but instead of turning it straight off when the meat is \u201cdone\u201d I let it cook another hour and it\u2019s always flavorful and falling apart",

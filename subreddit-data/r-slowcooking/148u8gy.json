    "postText": "3 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs.  \n1 jar salsa.  \n1 small can Chipotle peppers in adobo.  \n1 bag frozen corn.  \n2 red bell pepper, diced.  \n2 poblano pepper, diced.  \n1 onion, diced.  \n2 cans black beans.  \n1 bunch Cilantro, chopped.  \n1 spoonful better than bouillon chicken.  \n1 packet sazon.  \nI just shake about a teaspoon give or take of each of these, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, paprika, Oregano, red pepper flakes(if ya want a lil more heat). If you're missing something it's no big deal, chili powder, cayenne and coriander are also options or good replacements. Jalape\u00f1os, green chili's, serrano peppers are also great add ins.  \nAdd about 1-2 cups low salt chicken stock, don't quite cover. Cook on low for 8 hours then pull and shred chicken in seperate bowl. Strain most of the liquid out of the crockpot or scoop out all of those veggies and add em to the chicken. I prefer to strain the broth out and add the veggies and chicken back in. Use a lil cornstarch to thicken it up if ya didn't quite get all the liquid out.",

It's my favorite cut to use in a crockpot because it's almost impossible to dry em out. They shred into really nice bite-sized chunks and aren't as stringy as breast meat can get if ya cook em too long. I used to dislike shredded chicken, always sounded, and looked good but never turned out right until I used thighs.",

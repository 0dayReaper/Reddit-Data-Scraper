Root, not sticks.\nAnother tip: when you did the browning of the meat add a teaspoon of sweet Hungarian paprika powder and roast it very gently with the meat for a short time. Say a minute at most. \nVery gently is important, because too much heat and it will turn bitter.\nAfter that the tomato puree and roast that also for the same amount of time.\nThe powder will add extra dark colour and a good taste.",

You can always add more salt, you can't take it out once it's in there. Fresh herbs are more pungent and fragrant than dried, if you're using fresh herbs (which you should, especially for something like lamb) you don't need as much. While I don't measure in tsp or tbsp (I'm only a 2nd generation American on my Italian side and we traditionally just eyeball nearly everything), I'll do my best for you.\n\n------\n\nBone-In Lamb Shoulder, looks to be a few pounds. I would estimate like 4 lbs\n\n2 tbsp Salt \n\n1 tbsp Pepper\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil - just a drizzle to coat so seasoning really sticks\n\n2 cloves crushed garlic (I mean just one will work but like I said I'm Italian)\n\n2 tsp fresh rosemary\n\n1 tsp fresh thyme\n\n-------\n\nSeason lamb shoulder, drizzle olive oil and rub the roast to coat.\n\nPlace seasoned lamb shoulder in slow cooker, pour a cup or 2 of beef stock just to cover the bottom.\n\nIf I were you I would cut some carrots and onions into chunks and put them in there too. It will help flavor the roast and make a tastier sauce/gravy.\n\nSet on low and forget about it for like 6-8 hours. You should easily be able to pull it apart but it should still hold its shape.\n\nRemove roast from slow cooker and place on a sheet pan. Pour the liquid out into a separate container to make sauce/gravy.\n\nPre-heat oven to like 425/450 Fahrenheit \n\n-------\n\n**Gravy/Sauce**\n\nCooking liquids left over from roast\n\n1/4 cup dry red wine \n\nLike a tsp or 2 of balsamic vinegar\n\nSalt &amp; Pepper - fresh thyme to taste\n\n(bonus points if you take the leftover carrots and onions and macerate them)\n\nOver Med/High heat, in a large-ish sauce pan/high walled skillet heat up like 4 tbsp of butter until melted and bubbling and add 4 tbsp of flour. Whisk together to make a roux. When golden and smell of raw flour cooks off add the cooking liquid leftover from the roast and continue to whisk to prevent clumping\n\nAdd red wine and get a good simmer going. When the alcohol smell cooks off add balsamic vinegar\n\nTASTE!!! Add additional salt, pepper and a little bit of fresh thyme as needed.\n\nSimmer until desired consistency but at minimum it should coat the back of a spoon. If too thick, add some stock. If too thin, simmer some more.\n\n-------\n\nPut the roast that's been resting into preheated oven @ 425/450 degrees Fahrenheit. We're working with a high temperature because we just want to brown the roast a little bit, the cooking is done. Place in oven for like 8 to 15 minutes. You're going to have to just watch it. When it gets brown enough remove and let rest for like 10 minutes.\n\nShred and plate, pour over sauce/gravy or keep warm on the side.",

Figure out what flavors you like and try enhancing them. ***ALWAYS TASTE AS YOU COOK***. Ask people who you know cook about any tips or techniques or just hang around the kitchen with friends and family. When I was a kid at family parties, while my brother and my dad would spend most of the time watching the game with the boys, I spent most of my time in the kitchen with my aunts just watching them and asking them questions about what they were making and what ingredients they were using. Not to mention for a solid like 10 years all I watched was cartoons and cooking shows, most notably Iron Chef Japan.\n\nCooking is one of my passions especially cooking for others. It's one of the few things where I can break new ground and make new discoveries all on my own. There's rarely a better place to be with friends and family than the kitchen (unless it's my kitchen because it's very small).",

Then you just blast it with heat to brown the roast. They do a similar method with prime rib. You roast it low until it's cooked to the temperature you desire, let it rest a little bit, then blast it with high heat to brown the roast.

Get a deep roasting tray, put some diced onions, garlic, rosemary etc for the lamb to sit on and not stick to the bottom. Sit lamb shoulder on top, but of olive oil, good pinch of salt, pepper, rosemary on top. Cover tightly with foil. Into hot oven (I do mine in a covered gas bbq outside, as others have said, this cut is quite fatty and it can fill the house), after 15-20 mins turn the oven down to low, around 140-150 (280-300f), leave it for at least 3-4 hours but up to 5 is great too. Rest for a good 20 mins. Unwrap and enjoy. Mush the leftover veggies from the tray into a sauce/gravy if that\u2019s your thing (strain it tho, and scoop off fat/oil first)\n\nI\u2019m sure this is not technically the best way to do it, but it so goddam simple, literally five mins prep work. and it turns out like this post every single time. You can always pull the bone out clean.",

Things cooked for longer at a lower temperature are just as safe as things cooked for a shorter time at a high temp, but they are usually pinker.\n\nMeat that\u2019s slow cooked, smoked or sous-vided can be eaten more rare than is safe with other methods, but they are just rare, not raw. If OP used a meat thermometer, I\u2019m sure it would have been a safe temp.",

This recipe I typed up previously is for chicken, but just make the whole recipe without meat and add the shredded pulled pork in and heat it through with everything else.\n\nPad Thai recipe\n\n\n8-16 oz pad Thai noodles\n\n1 jar pad Thai sauce (I use Kroger Brand)\n\n1 lb chicken. Boneless, skinless thighs have more flavor, but breasts will do also\n\n2 red/yellow/orange bell pepper, sliced thin\n\nGarlic (I use the pre-mashed garlic in the jar and I like a lot. But maybe 2-3 cloves if you're not a garlic fanatic lol)\n\n3-4 large eggs\n\n0.5-1 cup shelled peanuts. Roasted/salted work fine, you just don't want shells. Skin on peanuts is ok\n\n3 scallion/green onion, chopped finely\n\n1 small handful fresh cilantro, stems removed, chopped finely\n\n\nCook the noodles, drain and wait\n\nAdd oil to hot pan. Cook garlic until fragrant and add Bell peppers. Cook until peppers soften. Remove peppers from pan.\n\nCook eggs in same pan, scrambled. When done, remove eggs from pan.\n\nYou can cook chicken before (in slow cooker, etc). If you didn't, cut into bite size pieces and fry up in same pan.\n\nWhen chicken, peppers and eggs are all cooked, add peanuts to pan to roast/warm them through. Maybe 2-3 minutes.\n\nAdd noodles to pan (all ingredients should be hot and cooked at this point, so stove burner can be off/low) and pour sauce over noodles.\n\nStir to incorporate sauce. Add green onions and cilantro on top/as garnish.\n\nEat.",

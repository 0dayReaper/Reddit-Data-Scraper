    "postText": "I cooked down mostly veggies scraps and some chicken bones that I had saved in the freezer in my slow cooker today. I was much more liberal with what I included than I usually am and the broth came out with a bitter aftertaste. I included some parsley, potato skins, green bean ends, and onion skins this time. Could one of those ingredients be leading to the bitter aftertaste?\nThanks for the help!!",

It\u2019s when using the wrong produce scraps in it, the long cooking time is a part of what brings out the bitterness in some things. So-the point is to look up what produce will result in a bitter flavor and simply not use them. Compost instead.",

I'd skip potato peels and green beans bits in that order.  The potato peels especially if at all old or even with any tad of greenness or sprouting.  The substances there are toxic which often goes with bitter.",

It would be interesting to try cooking down just the skins to see what the broth tasted like. I think you're right about the potato skins being the culprit even though they were clean and from relatively fresh potatoes. I just hate wasting anything!",

My grandmother was the most waste free conserving person I ever met.  She used washed and refused old rags instead of sanitary pads (which she had bought for her daughters!!  And don't do this folks...obviously not healthy!).  She wouldn't put potato peels into the pig slop but rather placed out for the chickens and I think (but not sure) that the chickens just ate fly larvae that were eating those potato scraps.  Especially if green or sprouted not a lot to do with potato peels.  If fresh then they're delicious for us roasted...but they have a tad bitter flavor (think twice baked potatoes or potato skins you've had at a restaurant).  So the bottom line is don't stress that.  Even saw a home farmer who said he tossed damaged potatoes (that you could salvage if used now) into compost and didn't fool with them.  He harvested many bushels of potatoes and literally fed his family all winter on them.  He wouldn't risk introducing rot to the healthy ones in storage.  His attitude was into compost and next year the nutrient will feed other plants.  This was a serious homesteader in Eastern Europe.  Anyway...live that you want to save.  As someone similar I often fail by trying to much if that makes sense.  Be well and \"Let it go!\" LOL.",

On high for about 2 hours.\n\nThe above photo was actually the reheat of the second bowl. The first was like a thick soup and after sitting for a few hours it thickened. Otherwise I'd suggest using potato to get a similar result. \n\nThe Edamame beans were steamed near the end and stirred in. Mushrooms steamed as well and cucumber grated.",

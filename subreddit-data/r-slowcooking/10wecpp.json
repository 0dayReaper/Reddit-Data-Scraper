This is bc in a slow cooker you have a heating element on the bottom and the sides. In a pressure cooker you only have a heating element on the bottom. This will make a difference in things. \n\nI don\u2019t knew anything about keto \u2026 but a lot of people on this sub recommended 365 days of slowcooking blog. The recipes include both slow cooker and pressure cooker recipes",

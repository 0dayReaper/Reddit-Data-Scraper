So ran it through the grill, bowled it to clean the grill, then put it through the grill again with a heavy dousing of Cajun spice. Then put to the side while I concentrated on the Slow Cooker.\n\nThis recipe was set to low for only 80 minutes so as to still have fennel with crunch and for the sake of a reheat later on this afternoon. Steak was added at the end prior to serving.\n\nIngredients \n\n6 rather large White Button Mushrooms \n\n2 cups of boiled water\n\n2 heaped tbs Margarine\n\n2 cloves of crushed Garlic\n\n3 tbs Sweet Basil\n\n1 tsp Mace\n\n1 Sachet of Hot &amp; Spicy (basic noodle spice sachet)\n\n2 size 8 free range Eggs whipped up\n\n50g of bag potato Chips (Salt &amp; Vinegar flavour) crushed and powdered using Mortar &amp; Pestle\n\n1 Fennel minus the bulb - so basically the Stalks (in this case 4) and all the Fronds. I saved the Bulb for later as it will last better / longer.\n\nNormally I'd add milk but the natural aroma this was giving off was just too good to make it creamy. Plus the potato chips and mushrooms broken up was enough it didn't need it. I missed Basil so much! Have a wonderful day!",

I decided to get a Mortar &amp; Pestle because I'd already moved towards vegetables moreso than fruit. Also garlic crushed seemed so appealing. Anyways, once I got it there wasn't much I was using it for. I was having Potato Chips with Sour Cream one day and only had the crumbly broken chips left that I couldn't dip. So had the idea to use the Mortar. What was even more cooler was when I mixed the resulting powder and sour cream together it went EXACTLY like Ice Cream (texture wise). Was such a different nice way to have it. So ever since the chip bags always get the smash! Lol \ud83d\ude06 \n\nHave fun!",

Haven't in ages due to dieting but always loved how flexible they are with ingredients.\n\nMace isn't commonly found here, there's only one particular place I travel on a train to get it. Only fairly recently just for something different, it's like cinnamon with a twang! Lol. Great on coffee - I'd imagine too on pancakes!\n\nI love mushrooms, ever since I seriously cut back on meat in general, they've helped fill the gap. I don't even really do chicken or beef stock type soups anymore so mushroom forms a good base to work from. Slow cooking them too means they easily brake down in the liquid.",

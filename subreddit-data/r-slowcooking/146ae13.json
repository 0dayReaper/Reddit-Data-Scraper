Mix together in a bowl 3/4 cup apple cider vinegar, and 3 tbs of Worshirer sauce, and 1 tbs white sugar. Pour all that liquid into your empty crockpot. Slice up a whole onion (yellow or white) and sprinkle the cut up onion into the crockpot. Garlic cloves, i love garlic i would use 5-8 cloves. Peel the garlic, crush it with the side of a knife, so the clove breaks open. Toss them into the crockpot. Feel free to give it a stir. -Now for the meat, mix the rub in a bowl, 3 tbs brown sugar, 1 tbs course salt (you could use regular, but course salt is good), 1 tsp Paprika, 1tsp chili powder. Put the meat into the crockpot, Fat side up, then use ur hand to rub the mix onto the meat. Put the lid on and set the timer to low for 8-10 hrs. Then grab 2 forks, and i shred the meat in the crockpot, stirring it up, and eat it.",

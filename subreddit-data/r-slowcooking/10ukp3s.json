    "postText": "I\u2019m making osso bucco for the family dinner tonight and decided to sear it before putting it in the slow cooker. But instead of searing it for one minute on each side I did over 2 minutes because I was half asleep and didn\u2019t think it through. \n\nIs the meat going to be too tough and over cooked now? I put it in the slow cooker and set it to 8 hours, but should I do 6 instead? Please advise, this is giving me anxiety and I don\u2019t want to mess the dish up completely if I can avoid it \ud83d\ude48",

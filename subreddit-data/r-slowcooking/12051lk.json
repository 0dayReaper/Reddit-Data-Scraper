I do feel like the instant pot cooks at a higher temp than most slow cookers though so keep that in mind when following recipes. It\u2019s also super nice being able to brown/saut\u00e9 first then slow cook without using extra dishes",

And I can assure you any bean dish you make will be better in a slow cooker than an instant pot. If you don't feel like a taste of Cajun food there is also chili. Or even lentil soup.",

So I made soups &amp; stews in the 3 of them. Made about 3 to 4 patches of each meal.  We had enough food, plus what my sister &amp; husband did to supplements that what I made for 3 plus months.",

    "postText": "We usually grab navy beans for baked beans, and in the rush of badly stocked shelves, too many people hovering, and an annoyed toddler, I grabbed soldier beans. I've never used them beforeand google isn't turning anything up lol. \n\nTo add salt to the wound I didn't even look or notice until AFTER I soaked them for 12 hours + threw them in the crockpot.

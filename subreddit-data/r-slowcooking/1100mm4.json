I find I just like the rinsed rice better.\n\nHere's Aaron Hutchinson from the Washington Post: \n\n*Growing up, my mother never rinsed rice. She would measure it out with a coffee mug, pour in twice that amount of water, and then place it on the stove to cook. The result was soft clumps of rice, which hold a place in my heart and bring comfort when I\u2019m in need.\n\nThat said, a pot of white rice is often judged on how separate the grains are, so if light, fluffy rice is what you seek, rinsing is key.*\n\nThe article is behind a soft paywall: \n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2022/02/04/should-you-rinse-rice-benefits/",

I don't always rinse my rice and while I notice with jasmine and basmati an improvement in rinsed rice grains separation is it enough to warrant I always rinse my rice? No, especially when after a brutal shift  in a medical office on my late day. \n\nI'm fine with overstarched short grain rice. I grew up on that.

I'm a pretty decent cook and made rice on the hob a couple of times a week for years, but I've never managed to make rice as perfect as the first time I used a rice cooker. Cooking rice really well is actually pretty hard...\n\n2) They're soooo cheap (if you want them to be). I can pick up a perfectly serviceable one for less than \u00a320. You don't get anything fancy for that (basically just a pot with an on button), but you'll still get perfect rice for years.\n\n3) If you spend a bit more on a fancy model, you can get ones that can do all sorts. Special modes for brown rice, for Thai sticky rice, for Persian crusty rice, for congee... some things that are even more tricky to do on the hob than basic white rice. You can also get ones with timers, keep warm modes, and other things that make them a great accomplice for a slow cooker if you like to set food cooking in the morning to be ready when you get home in the evening.\n\n4) Many of them also double up as a second slow cooker, soup maker, steamer, yoghurt maker, etc. (which are all at the end of the day just the same thing with different heating programs). They can be a pretty versatile piece of kit!",

You can't fuck it up or over boil it.\n\nYou don't need a fancy Japanese rice cooker that sings. Get the 15 dollar one at Walmart and it'll do. If it breaks just get another one from Walmart and return the broken one in the new box. Saying that I've had the same shitty one for like 8 years. Small little one that makes up to 4cups of rice in like 15 minutes. \n\nAlso you can cook shit in the rice cooker. Just throw in chopped veggies, eggs, rice, cheese, sausage, hotdogs, or really what the hell ever you want and it'll be done in 15 minutes and easy as hell.",

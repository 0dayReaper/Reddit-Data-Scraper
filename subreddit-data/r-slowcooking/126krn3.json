    "postText": "Our basic crock pot has a hairline crack that goes all the way through, so it's dead to us now. I never got into the instapot thing, because we just don't have counter or storage space for another appliance (didn't get into air fryer either but we have a convection toaster oven so we fry stuff in that sometimes). \n\nSince we have to buy a new crock pot anyway, I was wondering if people's opinions of instapots compared to slow cookers. We like our slow cooker because we can easily get a meal when we don't have the physical or mental energy. Is an instapot combo worth it? Do they work well? (Like the air fry function on our toaster oven doesn't work as well as an air fryer, but we are fine with that since we mostly use it for leftovers, whereas this would be a whole meal) are recipes easy to find? Anyone have a preference of one over the other? \n\nBefore we make the jump to buy a new one, I just wanted to understand what we'd be gaining or losing if we got a combo one. \n\nThanks!",

It's not as big as our slowcooker, and it's deeper, so makes it a bit more complicated to use it for some of these things. Overall, love the Instapot and there are some great recipies for it.  I also find it isn't as \"insta\" as they make you believe.  \"Cook time\" of 5 mins on a recipe, but there's 10-15 on the saute first, then add this, and heat for few mins, then add all the juice and set to pressure cook, which takes another 10+ minutes.  30-45 mins later you have your \"insta\" meal.\n\nAll that said, it's still worth it IMHO, and I did use an insta as a slow and insta cooker for a few years, but my wife prefers her slowcooker for those types of meals.",

            "comment": "I may not be the best example for you because I am 1) a single person and 2) retired so I no longer have to rush out the door in the morning and rush back ten hours later to put dinner on the table. But I\u2019ll give you my perspective. \n\nI\u2019ve always had a crockpot and I used it a lot. I loved coming home to the aroma of dinner ready to serve and the convenience. I used it on weekends for the same reasons, so I could do outside work and come in and have a hot dinner all ready. I\u2019m sure it was my most used appliance. \n\nI had thought about a pressure cooker for some time but I hadn\u2019t researched them and still had the old fashioned ones of my mother\u2019s canning days stuck in my head. Dangerous and not too practical. Air fryers never made sense to me with their little baskets and room they would take up. I couldn\u2019t see getting either one. \n\nThen, I spent some time with family and they introduced me to their air fryer and I saw some practicality to it but again, why take up space for the limited use it might see. I researched the electronic pressure cookers and thought I might use one of those and discovered the ones that also air fry. Both of them in the same unit meant less space required and the cost was also less than two separate units so I got one. \n\nI have not used the slow cooker feature on my pressure cooker but the consensus seems to be that it\u2019s not very good for that due to the heat coming only from the bottom. So, it likely would not replace that for you.  I\u2019m in a hot climate so my crockpot doesn\u2019t get as much use as before but there are still things I make in there, chili for one. \n\nThe air fryer is small, great for a single person but impractical for a family, I think. I\u2019ve learned to use it for all kinds of baking because it doesn\u2019t heat up my house saving money on the baking as well as AC. I can mix up cookie dough and keep it in the fridge and have hot cookies whenever I want. Biscuits for breakfast, chicken strips for dinner, even quick casseroles thrown together from leftovers in the fridge. \n\nThe pressure cooker gets used mostly because I love to make homemade broth from my rotisserie chicken carcasses. But I cook all kinds of things in it. I just google \u201cchicken thighs pressure cooker\u201d for example, to get new ideas. There are so many recipes out there. I always do my rice in it because of the time savings and no need for a rice cooker anymore. \n\nAs with a crockpot, the size of your unit should be based on what your intended use. I have an 8 quart and need all that space when making broth. \n\nFor me, I think I made the right choice. I\u2019ve tried to convince my sister it would be a good choice for her but she doesn\u2019t feel the same way. To each their own.",

There's no big ceramic heatsink to keep things even and the heating elements are on the bottom rather than sides.\n\nThat doesn't mean they can't work, just that certain slow cooker recipes will come out significantly worse.  But something providing its own convection like chili or soups probably come out just fine",

It has taken a lot of work to adapt our favorite recipes and they rarely come out like they used to in our crock pot.\n\nI don't feel like buying another new kitchen device so i guess this is our life now.\n\nInstant pot is fun and tasty in it's own way.\n\nWish I knew why they crack.",

Maybe we could if adjusted the technique and timing but we didnt. Just got an air fryer, it got daily use for weeks, and is still a useful kitchen gadget. Not sure how different the brands and sizes are but ours does a good job, its a bella pro series from best buy. 40 bucks at chrismas i think.",

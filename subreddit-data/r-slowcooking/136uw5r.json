(Salt closer to the end or it will be bland). Or you can add a package of macaroni about an hour before it\u2019s done but that would need a bit more water or broth.",

You could just as easily do plain Cream of Chicken soup, and white rice, but the Vigo rice is pretty cheap and it really adds good flavor.  I throw in a bag of frozen peas and carrots midway through.  The rice releases its starch as it cooks, and thickens everything up.",

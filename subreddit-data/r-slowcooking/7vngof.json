When I was a kid my grandma would make them overnight and we'd have sandwiches out of it for lunch the next day. She'd always call the more Italian one a \"Chicago Sandwich\" and the other just a \"Beef Sandwich\" or \"Hot Beef Sandwich.\" They're both essentially a poor man's French Dip.\n\nYou can also get these kind of roast sandwiches at gas stations across North Mississippi.

You can\u2019t get half of the cheeses and meat products you can elsewhere in the world. But I guess that\u2019s because you can\u2019t trust stupid Americans to eat something they shouldn\u2019t or cook it poorly and get sick. Which is ironic because that led to massive amounts of processed food and \u201ccookie cutter\u201d food that is no longer acceptable for the most part. We can\u2019t by tripe but I can by chemical cheese. It\u2019s bizzare. Massive industrialization is also to blame because once you start automating a process it because far less authentic. Which is why I think we are seeing a massive shift in local handmade food over the last decade. Plus we need shelf life because we have so many people in our country and it\u2019s so large And that the food has to be the same everywhere for \u201cquality control\u201d and uniformity that it became a necessity.

Both are added here in the dried concentrate powder form to mix with the melted butter and beat drippings to make a rich, slightly spicy gravy.  The pepperoncinis are similar to pickled banana peppers, but can vary in heat intensity and are often preserved with a more vinegary juice, some of which is added to combine with the gravy and add some tartness.\n\nThe cheese whiz is a tangy cheese sauce... hallmark of processed American \"cheese food\" products... but can be surprisingly good as a sandwich spread with meats like this... the famous Philly Cheesesteak, for example.",

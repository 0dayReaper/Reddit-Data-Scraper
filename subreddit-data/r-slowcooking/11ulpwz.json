I recently sold mine (old, small, and slow not a big loss). But I was wondering if any of you had recommendations on crockpots you would highly suggest? I love doing chuck roasts and pork shoulders so a decent size is good to Include in these if possible. Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: I live in the US, Minnesota specifically.",

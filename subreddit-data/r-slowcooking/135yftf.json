Big brown onion, 4 cloves garlic,  parsley, bay leaf,  carrots, celery,  russet potatoes, bag of frozen peas.\nPer Grandma Maggie: Tad of oil in hot heavy pan. Flour meat lightly, sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Brown meat \"real good\". When meat is almost done browning, add the chopped onion and brown it. Add a tad of water to make it gravy like. (Maybe quarter cup). Add chopped carrots and celery, bay leaf and squeezed garlic. Add about a teaspoon of Worsteshire sauce. Add 3.5 cups of tomato juice (V8) and about cup of water. Simmer low and slow 1.5-2 hours. Check periodically.  Add potatoes the last 45 minutes of cooking.  Add frozen peas and simmer 5 more minutes. \nThe stew will thicken as it sits. \nMom used to say the key is browning meat well. I always find it's better the next day. Btw, I believe she originally got recipe from the old Better Homes and Gardens red checked cookbook. Refer there for specifics. It's a job, lol.",

If you\u2019re looking for more of a stew that is more liquor based, I\u2019d add a bit more. Sometimes, for extra flavor, I\u2019ll do 1/2 a carton of low sodium chicken bone broth &amp; half reg ( this in a pot) \nAssuming the meat will sweat out it\u2019s juices and the rest of the ingredients, if you\u2019re looking for more of a roast type ( not stew) outcome, I\u2019d say it\u2019s fine this way. Not sure how much water is at the bottom. Even then, I\u2019d at least make sure there\u2019s about two cups in there to envelop all the ingredients w juice +\u2019seasonings during cooking process.

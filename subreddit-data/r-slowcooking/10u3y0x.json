InstantPot is a brand of electric pressure cooker - it's the first electric pressure cooker brand to be big so people often refer to electric pressure cookers as InstantPots, even when that's not the brand they have. CrockPot traditionally always made slow cookers and are THE big slow cooker brand - which is why people often refer to slow cookers as CrockPots even when that's not the brand they have  - but the company also makes pressure cookers. \n\nWhat you have is an electric pressure cooker that is CrockPot brand. While electric pressure cookers can often slow cooker, you will get a better slow cook experience with a more dedicated slow cooker appliance (difference in how the heating works and in the materials used in the pot, so the two dievices do cook differently). I recommend using your appliance mainly for electric pressure cooking purposes and if you are interested in slow cooking perhaps get a different tool for that.\n\nDoes this help?",

Both are used for braising meat, vegetables, etc that become more tender when cooked low and slow for a long time. Pressure cookers speed up that process quite a bit. \n\nTypical recipes are pot roast, stew, chili.",

                    "comment": "I have two instant pots and I use the a LOT. Pressure cookers aren\u2019t that complicated. The basics are simple: anything you want to braise or boil, you can pressure cook MUCH faster and easier in a pressure cooker. \n\nThe saut\u00e9 function allows you to saut\u00e9 things as you would in a frying pan. The combination of saut\u00e9 and pressure cook allows you to do a lot of easy one pot recipes. If you figure out saut\u00e9 function and manual pressure cook function, you can forget the rest of the buttons on your cooker. I\u2019ve never been a big fan of slow cooking in my IP. I can do it, but I prefer a plain old crockpot.\n\nFor stew, I\u2019d brown the beef on saut\u00e9 (high temp/more option), deglaze with wine, add enough broth to cover the meat and pressure cook on low for 15mins per pound of meat, open, add chunks of vegetables and pressure cook for another 5mins (vegetables don\u2019t need that long to cook). The cook time isn\u2019t that hard to figure out. Google how long to cook beef/potato/chicken etc in instant pot.",

I\u2019m just a little confused as to what the hype is with the brand.. my cheap slow cooker i got 8 years ago is far superior but maybe this machine does other things too au better that I\u2019m missing out on ? Close to giving it away but just need to know what I\u2019m doing wrong haha",

Come back in a few hours and you have perfect chicken or beef stock to use in any recipe that wants stock.\n\nTurn it on high and it reduces (less water, more concentrated the longer it is on)",

So I\u2019ve been trying out more recipes with my crockpot recently and just really wanted to post my favorite so far\u2026 which is of course the simple OG Mississippi pot roast. [The basic recipe I followed is here](https://belleofthekitchen.com/mississippi-pot-roast/), along with some advice from other Reddit posts and a couple things I added/changed:\n\n\n- ~3lb beef top round roast (because it was on sale and cheaper than a chuck lmao)\n- ~12 pepperoncini and half the jar of brine (maybe 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup) \n- 3 scotch bonnet peppers, deseeded\n- 1/2 packet of au jus mix\n- 1/2 packet of ranch mix \n- A couple carrots sliced\n- A medium onion roughly chopped\n- A couple stalks of celery sliced\n- A container of mushrooms sliced\n\n\nCooked for 10 hours on low. I cut out the butter and halved the seasoning packets because it was too fatty/salty for my liking. It ended up with more liquid than normal because of the mushrooms I think, but that worked out great over mashed potatoes\n\nEdit: forgot to add that I threw in a few roughly chopped cloves of garlic too",

They cut the slick fattyness that sticks to your tongue, and allow you to taste the meat and veggies more. They also give it some heat, not biting spice like eating raw peppers, but your mouth will just, idk, feel warmer. You gotta try it.",

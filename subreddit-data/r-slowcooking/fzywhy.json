If you want a entirely crunchy cookie this isn\u2019t for you. We\u2019ve actually been referring to it as \u201ccookie pie cake\u201d which sums up the experience quite well.",

Using an electric mixer, beat butter and sugars until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Slowly beat in egg and vanilla extract.\n\nAdd flour, baking soda, and salt and stir until fully combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Pour cookie dough into slow cooker and smooth top with a spatula.\n\nCover and cook on high for 2 1/2 to 3 hours (or low for 5 to 6 hours), or until the cookie is almost completely cooked through and only slightly soft in the center. Cookie can be kept warm in slow-cooker for up to 3 hours. Remove insert from slow cooker base and place on a cooling rack to cool. Use the parchment paper to remove the cookie, slice and serve\n\nhttps://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a58633/slow-cooker-chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe/\n\nSorry for not including my life story and all my childhood memories of cookies before giving you the recipe",

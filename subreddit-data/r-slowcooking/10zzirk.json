The meat goes in the middle after broiling.it is placed on a bigger platter. Then top with the mushrooms and surrounding the board are the veggies. Usually we served it with bearnaise hollandaise and bordelaise sauces. It is carved on the platter and served",

It was on offer at Lidl for \u00a310.20 as a single pot roast joint recommended as a slow roast on the label, it cut easily across the grain when I halved it.\n\nI chopped a whole onion, some garlic and mushrooms and browned one of the halves in olive oil and then de-glazed the pan with some red wine and added the juice. I diced some turnip, celery and mushrooms and sliced a carrot before adding a thick stock/gravy to it and put it in the SC for around six hours with some fresh breadcrumbs for added thickening.\n\nI'll roast some potatoes to eat it with later while my flat fills up with the delicious smell of the ingredients breaking down for the next few hours.",

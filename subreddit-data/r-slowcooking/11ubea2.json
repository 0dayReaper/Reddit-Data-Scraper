I did a similar recipe like OP except I used a pre-seasoned in the bag 2 pound point cut and a two pound flat cut, with beef broth instead of beer, in a 7 quart slow cooker. First hour was on high and now seven hours on low. The corned beef is still so tough I could barely stick a fork into it.   In previous years I\u2019ve cooked it on low for eleven hours and it was still tough as leather and the carrots were tasteless. Any ideas as to what I\u2019m doing wrong?",

Besides, a true craftsmen will never blame his tools!  I\u2019d hesitate cooking on high because it seemed to burn the upper edges even on low when I made spaghetti sauce last week. But I will try your suggestion the next time I use this slow cooker - or maybe half high and half low. The temperature setting, not me ;-)\n       I ended up cooking the two corned beefs for 16 hours, over the course of two days, checking for tenderness and taste every couple of hours. It never did achieve fall apart tender (like I made it a few times about 5 years ago). Although it was edible when I sliced it paper thin. This time I took out the carrots and potatoes after 15 hours and they surprisingly were tasty. I put the cabbage in for the last hour and a half and it turned out fine. \n       One possible reason may be because I put in 2 two pound cuts of meats, for a total of four pounds. I thought the 7 quart cooker should have been able to handle this much. \n       BTW, the point cut came out a lot tastier than the flat cut. I added the juice from both packages in addition to the seasoning packets that were included. I may just get two more point cuts and freeze them. There\u2019s no other cut of beef I could buy in the Los Angeles area for $2.99 a pound, not even ground beef!",

The fact that it was 2 of the 2lb roasts (4lbs total) is definitely something to consider, that is indeed a large amount. I havent googled the capacities of varying slowcookers, but im sure each has a recommended max. \n\nFor what its worth im glad you were able to still slice the meat and make use of it. It would have been a terrible waste otherwise of a good deal. \nI haven't had a good roast in a while and this posting had my mouth watering, so Im going to be keeping my eyes open this next while for sales. Best of luck on your future roasts Old-Actuary :)",

As you said, I experienced the carnival atmosphere in the US but it was far more commercialised there than it is here thankfully :-) If I had to listen to another celtic rock band singing drinking songs about Ireland I'd have thrown up myself.

I mean it is a brisket after all, and I've had BBQ briskets that fall apart and melts in your mouth.\n\nI sear it to add flavor, add onions and carrots let those brown a bit too then add the meat back in with the cabbage add vegetable stock and throw it covered in the oven for 3 to 4 hours. It's still got some grit to it but I don't need to slice it. Just twist off a piece and put it in a bowl with the veggies.\n\nI highly recommend it.",

She always said if you wanted to serve the \"national\" Irish dish on St. Patrick's Day, you should make Shepherd's Pie.\n\nEDIT: DV'ed by the self-righteous, as usual.

Corned beef however was very cheap and tasted similar enough that it became the stand in for immigrants who wanted a taste of home. \n\nThere is NO need for all of this hatred of \"not being authentic enough\" towards the Irish diaspora. It was fucking dumb in the 1860s when my great great great grandparents came over, and it's especially dumb now. It's not a competition over who can be the \"most Irish\" or whatever.",

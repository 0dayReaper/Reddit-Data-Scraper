Many\u00a0recipes\u00a0will call for an oven temperature high enough to ensure that a Maillard reaction occurs. At higher temperatures,\u00a0caramelization\u00a0and subsequently\u00a0pyrolysis\u00a0become more pronounced.\n\n&gt;The reactive\u00a0carbonyl group\u00a0of the sugar reacts with the\u00a0nucleophilic\u00a0amino group\u00a0of the amino acid, and forms a complex mixture of poorly characterized molecules responsible for a range of aromas and flavors. This process is accelerated in an alkaline environment (e.g.,\u00a0lye\u00a0applied to darken pretzels; see\u00a0Lye roll), as the\u00a0amino\u00a0groups (RNH3+\u00a0\u2192 RNH2) are\u00a0deprotonated\u00a0and, hence, have an increased\u00a0nucleophilicity. The type of the amino acid determines the resulting flavor. This reaction is the basis for many of the\u00a0flavoring\u00a0industry's recipes. At high temperatures, a potential\u00a0carcinogen\u00a0called\u00a0acrylamide can be formed.\n\n&gt;In the process, hundreds of different flavor compounds are created. These compounds, in turn, break down to form yet more new flavor compounds, and so on. Each type of food has a very distinctive set of flavor compounds that are formed during the Maillard reaction. It is these same compounds that\u00a0flavor scientists\u00a0have used over the years to make\u00a0artificial flavors.",

                            "comment": "Browning the meat before hand creates a flavor that you can\u2019t get while just slow cooking.  When you layer other flavors over top of this flavor, (like from the onions and carrots) it creates a more richer tasting, more flavorful dish.  Think of each flavor/ingredient as a single note.  When you start to add complimentary flavors together it creates a beautiful chord. \n\nBasically you cook the meat brown dry (well, technically in a little oil) over a hot skillet, just long enough to get some flavor and color on the outside, and then finish the inside in the slow cooker.  Since the slow cooker is basically a wet cooking method, it helps tenderize the meat more than you can do via a dry method.  The browning comes from the Milliard reaction on the proteins in the meat, which is different than \u201ccaramelization\u201d because that is specifically the browning of sugars, and not proteins. \n\nWhen you brown the meat it will get smoky in the kitchen, so be ready!\n\n*Salt the meat and let stand for a few minutes to pull more proteins to the surface.\n*Put a pan on the burner, and turn the burner on medium high.  \n*Leave it there until you can leave your hand, 1-2\u201d above the pan, for only a few seconds.  Or you can add a single drop of water to the pan before you put the oil in, and if the drop moves around the pan on its own, you are ready.  \n*Add just enough oil to just barely coat the bottom of the pan.  It should start to shimmer very quickly.  Use a light oil (like veggie or canola) so it won\u2019t smoke as much, and won\u2019t leave a burnt oil flavor on the meat.\n*When the oil hits the pan, don\u2019t leave the room.  That is when fires happens!\n*Put the meat in and DON\u2019T TOUCH IT for at least 2-3 minutes, and maybe more depending if it\u2019s a big cut of meat.  Flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes.\n\nYou might notice some browned bits still in the pan when you remove the heat. Add some veggie stock to the pan (or just water), and use a spatula to scrub the bottom of the pan and remove those bits.  Throw that into the slow cooker for even more flavor.  Just be mindful to not add too much liquid since the other ingredients will give up even more water in the slow cooker.  Proceed to cook in the slow cooker as usual.\n\nOne other tip I really like to use is about acids - vinegars, fresh squeezed lime/lemon juice, and/or hot sauce.  Ever tried a sauce and it just needed *something* but you just can\u2019t put your finger on what that something is?  It might need just some of the right acid.  I add balsamic vinegar and hot sauce to the gravy I use in my chicken pot pie, and it my gf and her parents say it\u2019s the best they\u2019ve ever had.\n\nSorry for the wall of text that you didn\u2019t really ask for.  I just nerd out on cooking and also understanding why you do little things when cooking and how they affect the final product.",

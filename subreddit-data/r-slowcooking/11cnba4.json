            "comment": "My abuelita used to make this for me when I was a kid and it was my absolute favorite.  She taught me this recipe when I was a teenager and wanted to be a chef.   I became a chef because of her. \n\nMy mom gave me a bunch of her recipes when she passed last year.  I made it a goal to make them all and show my kids what real Mexican cooking, from the dirt roads of Durango is like.\n\n I\u2019ve been running through all these recipes and it\u2019s been the best reconnecting with my abuelita over our love of feeding our families great food. I really miss her and I get very emotional cooking her dishes.  This one hit hard.\n\nI seasoned two pork shoulders (only 1 was photographed but I used 2)with Sal Elefante (she insisted on this specific salt), garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cumin, oregano, and fresh cracked pepper. Seared a nice crust and dropped them in the slow cooker on low for 10 hours.  I woke up at 3 am to make this dinner. But it was so worth it.\n\nI peeled and washed 3 lbs of green tomatillos, and \u201cfire roasted\u201d them in my convection oven (I cheated abuelita I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have a gas stove) along with four fresh jalape\u00f1os, four Serrano chiles, 1.5 white onions, and two garlic heads with the tops cut off. Wrapped in plastic for ten minutes then peeled and blended, all of it. \n\nAfter ten hours of slow cooking, the shoulder just falls apart, I removed some of the fat and added the pork to the Chile.  Dropped in two bay leaves and about a cup of the liquid from the roasts. Simmered another 2-3 hours on low heat.\n\nPoured over a crispy baked potato because my kids were skeptical of green food. It tastes exactly like hers. They absolutely loved it.\n\nAs I get older and make some of my favorite dishes\u2026 I realize more and more what people mean when they talk about cooking with love etc etc\u2026 the lengths she went through to make that for me\u2026",

I just squeezed the roasted paste out \n\nNo the tomatillos, jalape\u00f1os, serranos, onions and garlic are all roasted. The peppers and tomatillos are wrapped in plastic wrap to loosen the skin.  You squeeze the garlic paste into it and Then you blend it all.\n\nThe 10 hours is the slow cook time for JUST the pork\nShoulder.  The Chile takes like an hour or so so you just gotta time that part about 3-4 hours before you wanna eat because once you combine everything you still need to simmer it for a few hours to make sure the bitter juices are cooked out.",

It was about 18 servings or so and it wasn\u2019t going to fit in my 6qt. I prefer the crock pot to a stock pot for a roast every single time.",

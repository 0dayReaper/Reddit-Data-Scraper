    "postText": "Hello! I am cooking with a slow cooker for the first time today and very excited for this pot roast! The recipe called for a 3 lb chuck-eye roast/6 hours of slow cooking. My grocery store only had 1.5 lb ones, so I got two of those. Unfortunately, one of the roasts smells a little funky so I tossed it. Is it okay to still slow cook the remaining 1.5 lb roast for the entire 6 hours or should I shorten that?",

You could add a little more stock or water in the beginning, which is what I do if I'm going to be gone all day. Most often I just check on it a couple of hours before I expect it to be done. The meat will get softer with time which is fine if you're making brisket or shredded chicken for street tacos, less desirable if you want to retain structure for a roast beef.",

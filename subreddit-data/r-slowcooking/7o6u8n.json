Unfortunately this often meant they\u2019d hang off the side of a counter where kids could grab them a pull the hot appliance and contents down onto themselves.  \n\nSo appliance cords got shorter and severe scald injuries dropped.  \n\nThen kitchen islands came into vogue.  Often these are equipped with sockets on the side rather than at the back end of the counter.  So injuries started rising again.  So now some appliances are equipped with breakaway cords.  \n\nJust raising awareness about cord placement.",

Why? Percentages are relative, so if low takes 8 hours and high takes 4 hour to reach 209 degrees, the percentage of time spent at any given temperature over time up until may  temp us reached should theoretically be the same.

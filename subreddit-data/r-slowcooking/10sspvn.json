    "postText": "Making pork loin right now. The recipe said 8-10 hrs on low or 4 on high, but I forgot to start it until 10a. Would 2 hrs on high then 4-6 on low have similar results?\n\nWe have little kids and like to be done eating around 6-6:30, so we can get them to bed on time. If it weren\u2019t for them, I\u2019d just eat later.\n\nEdit: thanks all. I went for it and it turned out, um, well my family liked it. Haha. But it was the a good temp when it came out. That\u2019ll probably be my go to method. \n\nFirst slow cooker meal that\u2019s not soup or chili done!",

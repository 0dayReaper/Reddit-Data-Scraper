            "comment": "I never add liquid. I put chopped onion, carrot and celery in the bottom with a single stock cube and bay leaf.  Chicken goes straight on top, no stuffing, just salt and pepper rubbed on the skin.  High for 1 hour, low for three hours, high for final hour.  I remove and wrap the chicken in foil for 30-40mins to rest.  There\u2019s always liquid in the bottom with the veg.  I remove the bay leaf, pour all the veg and liquid into a saucepan, scraping the sides of the slow cooker with a silicone spatula.  With a stick blender I turn this into the base for gravy, blending it until smooth.  Add some hot water from the other veg (parsnip, carrots, swede) cooking on the stove top.  With a little thickener and additional seasoning it makes delicious gravy.  When they arrive the grandkids always ask \u2018has Pops made gravy?\u2019.",

While cooling, I pull all the onion and celery chunks out of the liquid and then turn that into a gravy in the crock. After the Turk is cool enough to handle (about an hour) I tear it apart by hand into big natural chunks and toss those back into the gravy on warm. You'll never have a more tender tasty turkey.

And if so, what kind (broth?) and how much?\n\n\nEdit: and additionally, does the amount of liquid you add change based on if you're putting veggies on the bottom (since they presumably lose quite a bit of liquid during the cooking too).",

Thoroughly baste the chicken with the fat and put in the air fryer for about 7 or 8 minutes. The rest of the stock makes great gravy.\n\nPeople literally can\u2019t believe how gorgeous it is: moist, tasty chicken with a crispy skin.",

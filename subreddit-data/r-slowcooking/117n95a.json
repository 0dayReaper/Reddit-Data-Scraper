    "postText": "So I made mine in a crockpot with ground bison, bacon, Velveeta, cream cheese, chicken stock, mire poix, fire roasted tomatoes, potatoes and washyoursister sauce. Cooked on low for 7 before adding Velveeta and cream cheese.\n\nWas very hesitant at the idea of the soup but was pushed by some colleagues and must say very impressed. \n\nI topped mine with scallions, dill pickle, french fried onions and shredded pepper jack cheese.\n\nWill definitely be making again.\n\nThank you all for your recipe ideas!",

Mix it all with electrical mixer, (how long? Til only slightly lumpy? Completely smooth?). Then fold in chocolate chips! \n\nPour into slow cooker. After about 2.5hrs on high, it should be done, poke it with a toothpick. If it makes you happy, eat it!\n\n* Parentheses are my direct questions to OP, bc info was unclear. Will update post with correct info if/when OP clarifies.  \nAlso, formatting is easy, but I was too lazy to do conversions to the list to freedom units, (which I, myself, would use. But baking purists would say the metric system *is* for baking, no matter where you are).",

Maybe it gives the ingredients time to know each other as all the 'pro chef's say",

    "postText": "Good afternoon,\nMaking the white chicken chili from the google doc and I accidentally grabbed a can of great northern beans and a can of garbanzo beans, instead of 2 great northerns. So I put the garbanzo beans in since I didnt have any other beans at home. I've never used chickpea in the slow cooker before. Is this going to be weird as hell or still yummy?",

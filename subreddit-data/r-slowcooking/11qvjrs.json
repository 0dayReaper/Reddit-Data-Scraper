    "postText": "Hey folks! We just realized that we're going to be at soccer practice at 5:45 4 nights a week between two kids. \ud83d\ude35\n\nWe don't want to be doing take out all the time, but we need some help! I can definitely research recipes but didn't know if anyone had a recipe they were like, yes, absolutely, make this!\n\n* We **try** to avoid dairy recipes.\n* In general, \"all in one\" pot recipes don't work well - both my spouse and the kids tend to dislike food touching; something where the side is rice and I can hit my cooker before leaving would be ideal.\n* I already have the Mississippi Pot Roast and Meatball Stroganoff. The soup is NOT a hit here.\n* Cost is a concern - I can swing the pot roast once every two weeks, so maybe not only pot roast/beef recipes. \ud83d\ude00 \n\nThanks for reading and any recipes you want to share!",

            "comment": "I find the crockpot really great for shredded meat than can be used for lots of things - tacos, wraps, salads, sometimes we even do bbq shredded meat on a baked potato. \n\nYou\u2019ll have a difficult time if the crockpot is just meat unless you prep stuff ahead of time. So my recommendation is to try to chop all veggies or premake some stuff on Sundays that you can easily reheat at home. \n\nAlso, those premade salad mixes from the grocery store come in handy for us to either top with shredded meat from the crockpot or mix up and use in a wrap with the meat. If you don\u2019t want to buy those, you can just buy whatever you like in a salad and chop it all ahead of time to mix up easily during the week.\n\nSoup is one of the easiest things I can do on Sundays to reheat throughout the week, but I see on your comments your husband doesn\u2019t like it as a meal. He may have to get over that or make himself something separate/in addition (would he feel better with soup and a grilled ham and cheese sandwhich or something for instance?) There are also some east crockpot soups like white chicken chili or lentil soups. Sometimes I do a lentil soup in the crockpot and then put it over couscous to feel more filling. Couscous cooks so fast also which is nice. \n\nAs someone else said, meatballs are also a great crockpot meal. You can do them just in marinara or the cocktail sauce/jelly meatballs. You can put them in a sandwhich, with pasta, or just with some veggies/salad on the side.",

I don't cut the chicken up just put the boneless thighs in whole as it will end up shredded but still all the flavor. I add the coconut milk and peppers (pre cut to save time) when I get home and turn it up to high. It is all ready in 5-10 minutes while I get the rest on the table. It also works with chickpeas.\n\nAlso the kids beg for her [Mango Chicken](https://myheartbeets.com/instant-pot-mango-chicken/) also in slow cooker instead of IP. Definately use frozen mango chunks. Toss the bag in the fridge the day/night before and it will be defrosted by the time you get home to do a quick blender puree. This one takes a small bit more prep because you have to blend the onion and ginger and saute 5 minutes to thicken before putting it in the pot. But well worth it. Can do this one with canned chickpeas as well.",

Not doubting your experience or taste buds it's just the complaint usually runs the other way when slow cooking, too juicy that its soupy and falling apart too much. \n\n Do you have the  recipe and could you share it? What's the technique you use? Dry rub? Marinade? Dump and Go, pre sauteing it? It would help to see the recipe and any things you changed or are tweaking due to personal preference or cooking style.",

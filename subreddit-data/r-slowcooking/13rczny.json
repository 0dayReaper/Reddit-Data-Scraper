Running a slow cooker dry as many do in this subreddit takes way longer as you're continuously heating air that escapes. It also long-term is more damaging in comparison to one that is used more for stews and soups etc.",

My timing method is getting it up to temp on high, then I turn it down to low and check it every hour after 6 hours by poking it with a chopstick. When the chopstick can pull it apart, then you know it is done. Usually it is about 8-12 hours depending on the size of the roast.",

I upgraded last year when my crockpot died, and it has been an unexpected game-changer.  They slow cook really well, but I will say that they are too expensive to justify if that is all you intend to do with it.",

                    "comment": "I have 2 Instant Pots and 2 slow cookers. May I offer an Instant Pot slow cooker tip? Because the heat comes from below rather than from the side as with dedicated slow cookers, I\u2019ve found that it helps to cut roasts into smaller pieces and rotate them. About halfway through the cook time, I swap chunks that were closer to the bottom of the pot with chunks that were above them. This allows it to cook more evenly. \n\nSoups and anything with a lot of liquid generally doesn\u2019t need stirring or rearranging when slow cooking, because the liquid will be equally hot everywhere, ensuring even cooking. The same goes for things that don\u2019t take up a lot of vertical space, like a single layer of chicken parts. The entire amount of food is close enough to the heat source that it cooks evenly. \n\nEnjoy your new pressure cooker, I hope you find many uses for it, as I have. \ud83d\ude42\n\nYou can also cut up (or slice) roasts before pressure cooking in order to decrease the cook time. I like to cut a pot roast into 2\u201d square chunks, or into 1\u201d slices. Cook time is reduced to about 30-40 minutes. Just make sure the chunks/slices are arranged in a random way. Don\u2019t stack them right on top of each other, because that\u2019s essentially the same as not cutting the roast at all.",

I picked it because it was big enough for a chicken or roast _and_ would automatically go to the warm setitng once it hit its time.  \n\nWhile it might seem sacrilegious, were I looking for a new unit today, I'd consider an instapot unit as they can function as a slow cooker as well as a quick cooking machine.",

You can set it to cook to a certain temp or for a set amount of time. They're nice features if you think that's something you would find useful. It looks like they have one now that also has an air fryer lid. (Air fryers were not a thing when I got mine.)",

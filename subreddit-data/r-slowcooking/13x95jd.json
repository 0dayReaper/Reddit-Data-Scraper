Alternatively, use any tough boney cut\n\n\u00b7 2 yellow onions, thinly sliced\n\n\u00b7 2 cans of kidney beans (800g)\n\n\u00b7 \u00bd teaspoon turmeric\n\n\u00b7 Salt and black pepper, to taste\n\n\u00b7 6 whole dried Persian limes, pierced\n\n\u00b7 4 cups finely chopped parsley\n\n\u00b7 1 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro (aka Corriander)\n\n\u00b7 1 cup chopped fresh fenugreek leaves, or \u00bc cup dried (this is called Kasuri Methi at Indian grocery stores). Note Fenugreek seeds are not a substitute\n\n\u00b7 1 cup finely chopped scallions (aka spring onion)\n\n\u00b7 2 tablespoons dried Persian lime powder, or \u00bc cup fresh lime juice\n\n\u00b7 2 cups water.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Add to the slow cooker (i) 2 cups of water, (ii) \u00bd teaspoon of Turmeric (iii) lime powder, and (iv) Persian limes. Poke holes in the limes with the end of a knife.\n2. In a frying pan brown the lamb necks. Get the pan as hot as humanly possible and caramelize the shit out of the lamb. This\u2019ll help a variety in meat texture later on. Move the lamb to the slow cooker once browned.\n3. Slice onions. In the aforementioned pan cook onions in residual meat fat for 10 minutes. I like the onions to range from cooked to cremated. Transfer onions to the slow cooker.\n4. Finely dice parsley, cilantro, fenugreek, and scallions. In the same pan as before add 1 cup vegetable oil. Heat on medium. Dump in all herbs and cook for 20 minutes. Season with salt to support breakdown of herbs. Transfer cooked herbs to the slow cooker. \n5. Add kidney beans to the slow cooker.\n6. Cook until meat is falling off bones, remove bones, and add pepper and salt to taste. Serve with rice/pilaf.",

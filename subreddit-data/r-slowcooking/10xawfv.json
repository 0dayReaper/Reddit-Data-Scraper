            "comment": "I may be in the wrong sub here, but I don't think you can make true gumbo in a set-and-forget slow cooker. You can make gumbo-like concoctions, but a good gumbo requires multiple phases.\n\n0) Get your seasoning ready. If you don't make your own, grab some Slap Yo Mama, but if we're taking baby steps then Tony Chachere or whatever will work.  You need a good 1/4 cup of it whichever you choose.\n\n1) Debone the meat, take the bones and roast them in the oven on a sheet pan at 400.  Lightly season the deboned meat and set it aside (in the fridge).  Slice the sausage. You can skip the roasting part if you're in a hurry, but keep the bones.\n\n2) Start your stock. Get a large pot, fill it about 3/4 to the top with water and get it heating up to a boil. \n\n3) Prepare the trinity.  Chop your onions, green pepper and celery and set aside. Toss the scraps from your onions and celery into the stock pot. Throw some peppercorns or pickling seasoning in there with a couple bay leaves. Discard the scraps from your green peppers into compost or trash, you don't want those in your stock. \n\n4) Toss the roasted chicken bones in your stock pot.  Let it boil. The longer you can let your stock perculate, the better flavor it will add so you should aim to be at this point a couple hours before you're ready to actually make the gumbo. The water line of the stock should remain about an inch above the \"stuff\".  If it gets lower than that before you're ready to use it, add some water and keep it at a heavy simmer. \n\n5) Grab two beers from the fridge and set them next to the stove. \n\n6) Grab a whisk and a cast iron skillet. Start to make your roux. Godspeed, you're going to need those two beers, maybe more.  One part oil to one part flour.  A big batch of gumbo will be about a cup of each. Smaller batches will requires less at the same proportion.\n\n7) Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it glistens then slowly whisk in the flour until it makes a syrup-like gravy.  DON'T STOP WHISKING.  Keep whisking until the gravy is a chocolate/coffee color, but no further than that or you'll regret it.  If you're nervous because it's your first time, no one will fault you for stopping when it's a dark peanut butter color. \n\n8) Kill the heat on the burner. Toss the trinity into the pan and mix it up so the veggies start cooking in the roux.  (Don't splash yourself with cajun napalm). Add the rest of your seasoning.  You will start smelling gumbo at this point. Grab another beer since the hard part is done.\n\n9) In another pan, with a little bit of oil, brown your meat. But really brown it.  Let the meat  scorch on the pan until it's cooked and only toss it if you absolutely have to. Take it off the heat and add it to your roux-veggie mix, scraping the browned bits off the pan as well. \n\n9) Grab another pot and start straining your stock into it. You want the pure gold liquid from your stock and nothing else. As much of it as you can strain into the new pot.   Add some more water to the original stock pot and keep it simmering in case you need some more of that juice later.  Bring the new pot to boil.\n\n10) One scoop at a time, take your roux-veggie-meat mixture and incorporate it into the clear boiling stock.  Let it come back to boil before you add another scoop so you can gauge its thickness.   You should notice that it's thickening each time you add a scoop.  If it gets too thick (instincts are key), add some more stock, bring back to boil then add another scoop until you're satisfied in the consistency.  Iterate this process until you've used all your mixture and the gumbo has achieved desired gumbo status.\n\n11) Let simmer until ready to eat. Serve over rice or other starch. \n\n12) Shit, we forgot to make rice\n\n13) It's your turn to do dishes",

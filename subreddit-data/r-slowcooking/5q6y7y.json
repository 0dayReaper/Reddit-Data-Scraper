Regular bacon is cured and uncooked. There is more fat in regular bacon because of that. When doing it cooked some of the fat renders off so there is less.\n\nIf you don't have a smoker add some liquid smoke to the brine then do it slow and low in the oven. As long as you don't cook it too long you can treat it exactly like cold smoked bacon.\n\nI don't know why anyone would even try to make bacon in a slow cooker. That's silly.",

Smoking is just applying smoke to something. There's a whole side of smoking called cold smoking where the intention is to *not* cook what you're smoking. You know, the traditional way bacon is made. Curing and cold smoking.\n\n&gt; exactly, you don't throw pork belly down in a frying pan and expect it to cook like bacon.\n\nI didn't think you were actually talking about just cutting raw pork belly and throwing it in a skillet. That's even worse than what I actually thought you were suggesting.\n\n&gt; did I say slow cooker? \n\nWe're in /r/slowcooking and you said you \"slow cook it\".

I do agree that most practices used are unethical, but I don't agree that just the basic idea that human can and do farm animals is unethical.\n\nThe Livestock Farmer's Code of Ethics:\n\n&gt; While a food animal is in my possession, it is under my care. I will provide the animal with a healthy, safe, comfortable, peaceful life. In exchange, the animal will be butchered for the production of meat for human consumption, and the slaughtering will be done in a humane and respectful fashion.\n\nWhich it would be nice if this was always followed.

Chicken is not terrible, but still worse than straight up plants. Most of it comes from the reliance of farming on fossil fuels, so moving our society to more renewable forms of energy is the big concern but there are other concerns with the scale of our animal agriculture (land use, water use, methane from cows, etc). An interesting but somewhat dated source: http://m.ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/660S.full\n\n\nEating less meat is one of the biggest things an individual can do to help the environment. A little bacon in chili occasionally is fine though. If you don't care about any of this one way or the other, well that's your right but I hope you change your mind one day.\n  ",

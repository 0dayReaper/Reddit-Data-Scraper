That's how it was with me anyway.\n\nThe problem with lots of Italian food outside of Italy is that it doesn't respect traddition or language.  In Italian cuisine, cooking something in a regional style like bolognese or campania, milanese is literally a food the same way they make it in those areas and they stick to those recipes.  It's like the difference between Irish stew, lancashire hotpot, scouse  or regular beef stew.  They're all roughly similar things but distinct in their differences.",

I rinsed and patted it dry, then rubbed it with salt, pepper, Mexican oregano, garlic powder, cumin and chilli powder. I measured with my heart on those lol. I put it in the slow cooker, fat cap facing upwards. Then I squeezed the juice of two oranges and one lime over it, put in a roughly chopped onion and about 4 cloves of minced garlic. I had a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce so I chopped and added those as well as the sauce they came in. Then I just cooked it on low for about 11 hours (my slow cooker might be broken lol.. it seems to take longer to cook than most recipes call for, I believe most recipes recommend 8-10 hours) then I removed the pork and shredded it, discarding the majority of the fat and simmered the liquid until it reduced down to about half of what I started with. Then in a large skillet I heated about a tbsp of oil, took a third of the pork and spread it evenly and put some of the liquid over it, waited for the liquid to mostly evaporate and for the pork to be a little browned and a bit crispy. Then I stirred it a to let it cook slightly on the other side and then removed from the pan. Repeat with two more batches to brown the rest of the pork.\n\nAfter it was all done I just topped it with some fresh cilantro and an extra squeeze of lime juice :)",

So I guess I bought the wrong thing but I still tried to make it work. I cut it up into smaller chunks and at first cooked it for a few hours on low, was still way too tough and chewy, so I put it back into the crockpot for another 12 hours until it could finally smush into those thin fibrous \"pulled pork\" pieces that get so crispy under a broiler, so yeah it took a long time and I bought the wrong cut of pork but the results are still tasty.

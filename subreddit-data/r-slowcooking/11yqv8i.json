The recipes are \"Butternut Squash - Apple Soup\" and \"Harvest Ham Supper\".  \n\n\nWe took the recipe to the grocery store with us but the recipe never made it home with us. So now we don't know what to do with the ingredients.\n\n\nIt appears my better half has posted this question in the sub as well. Great minds think alike.",

I think it also has the butternut squash apple one, but it's called \"Autumn Apple and Squash Soup.\"\n\nHarvest Ham Supper- 6 carrots (2 inch pieces), 3 sweet potatoes (quartered), 1.5lb boneless ham, 1 cup maple syrup. \n\n-Arrange carrots and sweet potatoes along the bottom of crock pot.\n\n-Place ham on top and pour the maple syrup over the meat and veges. Cook low, 6 to 8 hours.\n\nI'm trying to get into my imgur account to post the other, since it's much longer. Apparently I'm locked out. I'll keep trying!",

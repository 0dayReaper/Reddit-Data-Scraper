I have found if you slow cook this enough, the meat is tender and falls apart).\n* 2 32oz boxes of beef broth/stock\n* 1 pkg Wylers/Bear Creek beef veg soup starter (I think there is extra stock in these and thickeners)\n* 3 large carrots, peeled and quartered\n* 1/2 onion diced\n* 2 stalks celery diced\n* 4 small russet potatoes peeled and cut into bite size pieces\n* 1 cup barley (these help thicken and add a lot of body)  Fair warning, you might want to use 1/2 cup barley.  1 cup makes it almost a stew.  But our family likes thicker soups.\n\nCut everything up and throw in crockpot.  Cook on low for 8 hrs or high for 4 hours.",

So there is no need to add additional salt.\n\nI DID add black pepper because we love black pepper.\n\nI usually add a bay leaf or two when I made soups but there is no need with this base soup starter packet.",

Sear the thighs quickly on a skillet or pan before you put them in the crockpot. Trust me. \n2. I only had boneless skinless thighs in the fridge but if you\u2019re looking for extra taste, get bone-in. \n3. Instead of ketchup, add a mix of ketchup, bbq sauce, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. \n4. Instead of just dried basil, I used a mix of Italian seasoning, white pepper, black pepper, and harissa powder (for an extra kick). \n5. Added a bit of ginger + garlic. \n\nDuring preparations, I put it on low for the first 3.5 hrs and then on high for about 45 mins to reduce the water a bit. (Use your judgment on when to turn it off)\n\nThe result is excellent! There\u2019s just enough sauce left to go well with fried rice or veggies, and the chicken isn\u2019t too dry or overdone. For 30-ish mins of prep I\u2019m super happy with the outcome.",

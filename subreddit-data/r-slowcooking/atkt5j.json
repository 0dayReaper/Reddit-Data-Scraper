            "comment": "Story time. I was on a road trip with a friend in Central America several years ago. He and his girlfriend were living in Mexico for a year. She had been wanting a crock pot, which she\u2019d neglected to bring, and hadn\u2019t been able to find anywhere. So as we went through each town, we\u2019d stop in kitchen appliance and secondhand stores and check for crock pots. It took us a long time, but we finally found one. Of course, we bought it.\n\nFast forward a few days. We tried to take our car (rented from a friend who rents cars long-term to travelers) into El Salvador. They say no, we can only come in if we have specific, notarized permission from the owner of the vehicle. We didn\u2019t know we\u2019d need this. So instead of skipping El Salvador, we leave the car by the border bridge, in the \u201cDMZ\u201d between the two border checkpoints. There are a bunch of guards at the bridge, so we don\u2019t think much of it.\n\nEl Salvador was fun. We got to see a circus with no animals and eat papusas.\n\nI\u2019m sure you can see where this is going. It turns out, the bridge guards go home at sundown, when the crossing closes. When we returned the next morning, the car was still there\u2026 but it had its driver-side window smashed in. The radio had been stolen, along with a bunch of stuff from the trunk (including laptop and camera). The entire bench cushion of the back seat was missing. Our clothes were strewn everywhere. The car wouldn\u2019t start. The driver\u2019s side seatbelt had been removed and tied to the rear bumper. It was a complete mess.\n\nAnd the crock pot? They\u2019d only taken the ceramic pot, something they could use on a fire. They left the electric piece. So my buddy\u2019s gf got HALF a slow cooker.\n\nThat was an expensive trip. Word to the wise: don\u2019t abandon your car at sketchy South American border crossings without speaking to anyone.",

    "postText": "I bought a 6 quart Crock-Pot slow cooker and tried it out yesterday. It overcooked the food on low. The recipe called for 6-7 hours. At 5 1/2 hours the chicken was dry tasting 185 degrees at testing. The egg noodles were overdone at 20 minutes, whereas the recipe called for 30-35 minutes. \n\nShould I try another brand or keep this one and learn to adapt the recipes? TIA",

            "comment": "I really don\u2019t mean this to come across as rude (?) but I think the issue is that you\u2019re taking the recipe times as bible when there\u2019s no way for a single recipe to know how long it\u2019ll take in every appliance. Common sense, look, taste, touch &amp; experience are a much better indicator of when something will be done. Once you get a feel of how quickly or slowly things cook it should become a lot easier.",

I made 4 chicken leg quarters in my Crockpot yesterday, and they were done after 4 hours on high. Slightly over done actually. Pork butt/shoulder are the ones you want to cook for a really long time. Like 8-12 hours on low.",

For chicken I'd do low for 3-4 hours, high for 2-3s...6-7 for chicken would be for chicken jerky...\n\nI got a thermopro grill thermometer with bluetooth that I use for chicken a lot of the time, its got two probes and my phone alarms when it hits the right temp.\n\nAlso have one of those small 2qt crocks, 4 chicken breasts, italian dressing seasoning and some chicken broth...perfect chicken breast in 3 hours",

            "comment": "I refuse to follow set recipes - they're wonderful for inspiration but taking them literally is a fairly subjective risk. A Slow Cooker that's 6 litres will have a different result than a 3 litre using the same recipe. So recipes can be misleading. It's not like Oven recipes where everyone's Oven is generic in size.\n\nYou mentioned your last one lasted 18 years, so you have way more experience than me but the best suggestion I have is to prioritise you're ingredients thoroughly. Not only in order but portion sizes. Things that need longest go first, more delicate items last. It's easy to fall into chucking everything in at once - you can but really consider the need of long cooking. Even cook things separately, then reconstitute and most importantly - take your time.\n\nThere's 2 trains of thought I notice with people who Slow Cook - \n\n1 hardly any liquid / big slow cooker. \n\n2 always stew or soup / small slow cooker.\n\nObviously you can do either but I always shy away from #1. My experience is the Ceramic needs water adjacent to disperse the heat, without that it will only overheat. Whilst the ceramic itself was created under extreme temps and to conduct heat, it still has it's limitations. So to me #1 is like thrashing it. #2 is being more careful.\n\nAn Oven is metal so roasting is viable but using a Slow Cooker in a similar vein I'm not really for. It might seem alright at the time but I think those people are using their cookers once in a while.",

Set temp to monitor your desired internal temp and never overcook your meats again. I use this method for my crock pot turkey breast. So juicy and tender. Only one way to know how hot the meat is, thermal probe.",

I ended up buying a Hamilton Beach, based on comments that it wasn\u2019t quite as hot.  I can see that my Hamilton Beach doesn\u2019t boil on low like my Rival Crock Pot did, but otherwise I haven\u2019t don\u2019t any experimentation.",

Also the vegetable mix can vary between brands. So you could experiment with that. Might be good to order one jar from Chicago to get the taste for comparison sake. It\u2019s a nice condiment to have on anything really if you like pickled veggies.",

Simmer the seasoned juice for 30-40 min let all the flavors dance together. Cut a slice of cheese in half, place along the bottom of the hinge cut bread. Put 5 or so oz. of beef in the juice, let sit for a minute or so to get hot. Put beef in bread (get some juice in there too...juicy is good) add peppers. Put more cheese slices on top of beef. Throw in oven for 4 or 5 minutes, so the cheese melts and the edges start to brown. Serve with a side of juice.\nOnce you\u2019ve mastered this, you can move on to the real deal....the combo.",

    "postText": "I started a homemade bolognese sauce in the instant pot on the slow cook setting on low around 1:30 pm today. I plan to use it tomorrow to make lasagna. Would it be a bad idea to leave it in the slow cooker on low until tomorrow morning at 6 am or should I wake up at night to take it out? Originally planned to slow cook 10-12 hours on low. Advice needed from anyone who has experimented making bolognese sauce in the slow cooker before pls :)",

    "postText": "I used my slow cooker last night...and pulled the chicken out about 11pm. It was meant for tacos so I shredded it in a ceramic bowl and covered with foil while it sat out and cooled before the refrigerator. Went to bed forgetting it...and 8am realized it was still out.  I put it in the refrigerator for now but just questioning if it's safe to eat. I imagine it was still warm by 3- 4am. \n\nEdit I threw it out, cooking new batch now. Grrrr",

I can\u2019t ever recommend you ignore basic food safety just to save money, so I can\u2019t recommend you eat it. \n\nIf it was me in this situation however, I\u2019d probably take a bite or two and see how I feel in twelve hours. But if you can afford the mistake, toss it to be completely sure.",

Then you have to rotate the stock, and meat always has to be stored on the bottom of the walk in, never above other products. \nAt home, just use common sense. No need to panic, especially if you don\u2019t like your family. Just make yourself a ham sammich and wait to see if the room temp chicken kills anyone.",

Happens all the time. I've done it more times than I can count. What's the difference between cooked chicken wings or pork ribs sitting on a table for 8 hours and your shredded chicken sitting out the same amount of time?\n\nThe truth is, in the west, we are far too fearful of room temperature food. I eat shit that's sat out all day, all the time. When I was a kid my parents would order pizza, I'd sneak one into my room and hide it under the bed at like 6pm then wake up at 7am and eat it straight out the box from under my bed. Never got sick. Somewhere along the line I erased this from my memory and accepted that it's not safe.

Just thinking back to my Great Grandmas house on this front. \n\nOthers will have been raised completely differently, with different experiences and likely a varied penchant for science based food safety.  Appetites for \u201crisk\u201d will vary.\n\nI have to be honest I live a life now very far off from my upbringing and clearly still practice some of these habits but I actually didn\u2019t know the scientific dangers around this until I read about it a year ago or so on Reddit.

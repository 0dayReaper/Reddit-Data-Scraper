No, it won't turn it into a bomb, but the [instruction manual](https://s7d9.scene7.com/is/content/NewellRubbermaid/DASH/S7_int/2020/4-7Qt-Smart-Pot-Cook-Carry-SlowCooker-IB.pdf) says not to do this because it could break the glass (see page 5).\n\nThe pressure of the steam isn't the problem; the heat is. If it's locked, it could cause stress as things expand with no room to move.  Sure, it may not cause a problem for most, but locking is how I turned my Crock-Pot into a Cracked-Pot. It's not worth the risk IMHO.\n\nEdit: clarified which pressure isn't the problem.",

My lid has a hole in it for a temp probe. \n\nOne lesson I did learn from locking it was that if you have a plastic liner in there, the heat can cause a big bubble between the liner and the side of the cooker. That bubble can then raise the fluid level inside the crockpot high enough to leak out.",

It helps prevent spills.\n\nThat hole in the lid is probably to release steam, not for a temperature probe. You should probably make sure that the probe doesn't completely seal the hole. (EDIT: it probably wouldn't be dangerous, but the pressure will leak out in ways that are messier)",

            "comment": "No disrespect, really, just don't call it chicken paprikas. It may be a good tasting dish here, but it has nothing to do with that food.  \nChicken paprik\u00e1s:   \nBrown the chicken in a hot pan, (preferably with skin on bone-in). Once browned, remove it, put aside for later -   \nAdd lard if  the pan is too \"dry\", saut\u00e9 the finely chopped onion, picking up the browned pieces till it's translucent, soft. Add finely chopped garlic, mix till the scent is nice.  \nAfter that it will be a bit intense for a few minutes, pull the pan off the direct heat, add *shitton* of paprika - then double that amount -  and mix it well. Back on the heat, put back all the chicken, mix it, add a little bit of chicken stock to avoid burning of the paprika. Salt and pepper.   \nAdd small cubed or crushed tomato, not too much, or it will be too acidic. Fill with some more chicken stock to cover the meat and with *no* cover, cook on low-med for about 40-ish minutes, till the meat is soft. Mix some flour in a bowl with sour cream so it's not thick, not lumpy; texture like a light pancake batter - mix it well (you can use corn starch but less than flour then).   \nMix it with the chicken, add as much chopped parsley as possible without looking silly, one more bubble run and you are done.   \nSp\u00e4tzle is another story - when it's uncooked it's just flour, eggs, salt and milk. :)  \n\n\nChicken paprik\u00e1s is not for the slow cooker, no matter how we love that. 4-5 hours is just too much. The whole process is max an hour A to Z.",

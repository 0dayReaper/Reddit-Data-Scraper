We got to eat all kinds of new things like Kangaroo meat! While im not the biggest fan of the meat, Im always stoked when I have a cheeky bbq piss up with the boys and someone brings a pack of roo snags!\n\nA lot, if not most grocery stores will have kangaroo tails in the refrigerated dog food section too, they got crazy for em. \n\nI can most compare roo to a meat like bison because they both are a very normal meat to consume but you can definitely tell when you bite into it that it isnt a traditional western consumed meat.",

There's actual reasons for the taste/smell, having to do with the animal's diet and compounds in the meat breaking down into sulfides, which humans are really sensitive to. Some ppl love it, some ppl hate it. My guess is that the ppl that really love it aren't as sensitive to the sulfides as some ppl are.\n\nI grew up eating deer as I'm from MN, and we were quite poor. During the winter, pretty much the only meat we got was the deer my dad hunted. My mother loathed it and refused to eat it; I'm not overly fond of it, but I'd get used to it. Both my mother and I have very acute senses of smell.",

No, let's not use something that's renewable and biodegradable and means we're using more of the animal so nothing goes to waste, instead let's make clothes and products out of PLASTIC that falls apart in two years and adds more microplastics to the ocean that get mistaken for plankton and eaten by lots of sea life which goes on to get eaten by other sea life until they're all dead from eating plastic! It's because we love animals!!!",

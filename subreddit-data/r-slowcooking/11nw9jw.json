            "comment": "Dear readers, I am thrilled to share with you a delicious recipe for Slow Cooker Marry Me Chicken that is sure to become a favourite in your kitchen! This recipe is not only easy to prepare, but it also yields a flavourful and tender chicken that will make your taste buds dance with joy.\n\nWith this recipe, you can simply add all the ingredients into your slow cooker, set it, and forget it for a few hours. As a result, you'll have a mouth-watering and satisfying meal ready to serve to your family and friends.\n\nTrust me, once you try this dish, you'll want to make it again and again. So, why not give it a try and see for yourself how delicious and easy it is to prepare? Your loved ones will surely thank you for it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for Slow Cooker Marry Me Chicken:**\n\n\\* 5 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced into thin cutlets\n\n\\* 1 and 1/2 cups of chicken stock (360ml)\n\n\\* 1 cup of heavy cream (240ml)\n\n\\* 3 cloves of garlic, sliced\n\n\\* 1/3 cup of sun-dried tomatoes, diced (50g)\n\n\\* 1 tbsp tomato puree\n\n\\* 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour\n\n\\* 1 teaspoon of black pepper\n\n\\* 1 teaspoon of oregano\n\n\\* 1 teaspoon of paprika\n\n\\* 1/2tsp chilli powder (optional)\n\n\\* salt to taste\n\n\\* Fresh basil, chopped, for garnish\n\n\\* Grated or shredded Parmesan cheese, for garnish\n\n\\* Sliced Cherry tomatoes for garnish\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to prepare Marry Me Chicken in Slow Cooker:**\n\n**1.** In a small bowl, whisk together the tomato puree and flour until smooth to create a paste.\n\n**2.** In the slow cooker pot, add the chicken stock, flour mixture, heavy cream, black pepper, oregano, paprika, and chili powder. Whisk until well combined.\n\n**3.** Stir in the sliced garlic and diced sun-dried tomatoes.\n\n**4.** Add the chicken breast cutlets to the slow cooker and submerge them in the sauce. (You can sear the chicken on the pan before adding to the crock pot but it is not necessary for a delicious dish)\n\n**5.** Cover and cook on High setting for 3 hours or Low for 6 hours.\n\n**6.** Once done, garnish with grated Parmesan cheese, chopped fresh basil, and sliced cherry tomatoes.\n\n**7.** Serve the chicken over pasta or with boiled potatoes, enjoy with some red wine and your other half :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tips for Marry Me Chicken in Slow Cooker:**\n\n\\* Consider using boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts. Thighs are juicier and have more flavour than breasts, and they also hold up better to the longer cooking time in a slow cooker.\n\n\\* Use good quality meat for the best result. Look for chicken that is organic or free-range, and avoid chicken that has been injected with water or additives.\n\nOriginally posted: [Slow Cooker Marry Me Chicken](https://www.insightflavour.com/post/slow-cooker-marry-me-chicken)",

Thighs are juicier and have more flavour than breasts, and they also hold up better to the longer cooking time in a slow cooker.\n\nThis should probably be the default recommendation.

These introductions, which can range from a few sentences to several paragraphs, often include personal anecdotes, cooking tips, and background information on the dish being shared.\n\nWhile some users appreciate the extra context and enjoy reading these introductions, others find them to be tedious and unnecessary. In fact, many have taken to mocking them, with memes and comments poking fun at the lengthy intros.\n\nSo why are recipe introductions becoming so prevalent on Reddit? There are a few potential explanations. For one, many users are simply passionate about cooking and want to share their knowledge and experience with others. Additionally, some may feel that including a personal touch in their recipe post makes it more engaging and relatable.\n\nHowever, others speculate that recipe bloggers and influencers may be using Reddit as a platform to drive traffic to their websites. By including a lengthy introduction with a link to their blog, they can potentially increase their website's visibility and gain more followers.\n\nRegardless of the reason behind these lengthy recipe introductions, it's clear that they have become a topic of discussion within the Reddit community. Whether you love them or loathe them, it's hard to deny that they are now a fixture in many recipe threads.",

Slow cookers take a long get time to warm up and it can take several hours to reach a temp that\u2019s considered \"bacteria-killing.\" Chicken needs to reach an internal temp of 165 degrees before it\u2019s considered safe to eat and, if it spends too much time thawing out, bacteria like salmonella and staphylococcus aureus can grow. \n\nI mean, I\u2019ve done it, when I forget to thaw the chicken. I try to avoid it, though, even if I have to microwave it. \n\nSource: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/poultry/chicken-farm-table (about midway down the page)",

These temperatures over 3-6 hours are sufficient to cook the frozen chicken breast meat, as the internal temp of defrosted meat should reach around 162-167\u00b0F for 2 minutes.",

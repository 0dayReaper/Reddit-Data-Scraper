Grab a bag of 15 bean soup and an onion and Bob's your uncle!\n\nPro tip, don't use the seasoning packet, it's way too salty (the ham has enough salt for the soup). I use a little lemon pepper and a few shakes of MSG (I get mine at the local asian market, but you can get Accent at any grocery store)",

Split pea for my soup pot would be 3 pounds dry split peas, the bone, a lot of chopped celery and onion, a little chopped carrot (a lot makes the soup too sweet), salt, and garlic powder, plus water, You will have enough soup to freeze until Kingdom Come. Slip some of the ham meat off and leave it in the soup BTW.  Or take all the meat off the bone and grind it in the Cuisinart with sweet pickle then mix it up with mayonnaise.  Eat Ground Ham on crackers while drinking beer and watching football. Every molecule of a ham can be used. Finally, give  bone to dog in back yard. Dog will be very happy.",

The fancy ham stores like Honey Baked sell ham bones. When they get an order for a party platter they run the ham through a slicing machine but the bone prevents it going all the way so they stop pushing and this leaves a ton of choice ham on the bone, more than enough to make soup or whatever. After they do the platter they stash the bone in their freezer waiting for you or me to come in and ask for it. So any time you happen to pass a fancy ham store, check to see if they have a bone. They aren't giving them away---the last one I bought was $8---but this is very nice ham and there's a lot of it.",

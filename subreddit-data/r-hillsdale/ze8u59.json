I came into my first semester wanting a 4.0 and was overworked and let down at the same time - instead, just expect that you won't get A's and A-'s in a few classes and enjoy the learning experience. \n\nDorms: If you're a guy, Whitley or Galloway is probably your best bet. If a gal, go McIntyre. \n\nAlso, if you plan on studying in classrooms a lot, bring your own expo markers! 99% of the whiteboard markers in the classrooms are dry to the point where they're either uncomfortable or unusable. A $5 investment in your own expo markers will save you anguish and awkwardly asking to borrow markers from your neighbors. \n\nCongrats on your admission!",

I met my best friends there and that makes all of it worth it. If you have any questions feel free to message me! I graduated pretty recently and am still pretty in touch with the area.",

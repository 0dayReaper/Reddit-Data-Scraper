    "postText": "The healthiest grab&amp;go option (chef salad) has the sodium content of about two entire servings of Ramen noodles. Almost everything else has even more, and that doesn't even include the sides. The college forces us to buy meal plans and the cheapest option for me is the 100 block(which means i have to supplement with my own groceries) Its 21 dollars per meal swipe, which is more than what a steak dinner costs at the most expensive restaurant in the county (Olivias). Since we're forced to buy meal plans, Bon Appetite or the college pockets the money we pay for meal swipes we don't use. They're incentivized to make disgusting and unhealthy food so students don't use the swipes they already paid for. \n\nThe dining hall is rarely any better. Its always over crowded, which is why Grab&amp;Go is often the only thing I have time for between classes. The only thing they dont consistently screw up is pasta and pizza, which is extremely destructive to eat every meal. Their meat dishes are, more often than not, raw or burnt to a crisp. I've swiped into the dining hall, got one of every meat dish, and thrown all of them away before, one by one, because I didn't want to get food poisoning. Ive gone entire days consuming nothing but coffee and water until early evening when I have time to make my own food.\n\nI honestly don't care nearly as much about the money as the fact that I'm always tired and bloated from the garbage they make us eat. The same food you get for a meal swipe is literally 5 or 6 dollars at walmart if you buy for a week and divide it by the number of meals. Its reducing my quality of life and inhibiting my studies because of it. Almost everyone I've talked to has similar complaints and the administration chooses to do nothing about it. \n\nThe college has a $600,000 endowment *per student* and the admin chooses to price gouge us for a few thousand bucks a year to feed their unsatiable greed",

But I think it also depends on what you\u2019re hoping to study. If you\u2019re interested in the sciences/psych kinda stuff it may be easier. If you have any questions about Hillsdale too feel free to message!",

I was liking St. John's because the spam emails they sent me looked really cool, and I really appreciated the books they had in their curriculum, but then I was deterred from St. Johns without question after one of my friends said that college is not that great (she is in high school, so I don't know why I trusted her without question). I should've asked why she said that, but I didn't, and now I'm curious if dropping this college off my radar was a mistake. Let me know what you think please, as a St. John's student yourself :)",

                    "comment": "St. John's is a great school. The question is one of your compatibility with the school's ethos, not the caliber of the institution. It is hard to describe if you have not experienced it, but St. John's is primarily small, interconnected community of people, and a school second. There is a reason everyone refers to SJC as the 'polity'. Reading and discussion are the two pillars of St. John's, and the bi-weekly sacrament is Seminar--held on Monday and Thursday night from 8-10pm--which functions both as an academic class and also a kind of ritual. The whole college is designed to foster the reading and discussion of books everywhere. If you are going to thrive at St. John's, you will not do so simply by being an over-achiever academically. You have to buy in and really engage in the community life. That looks different for everyone, but fundamentally if you isolate yourself, you can't discuss, which is what the whole thing is about. \n\nIf you end up going, 1) play intramurals (those who play stay is a Jonnie proverb), 2) go to swing dancing classes, and go to the swing dancing parties--they are big part of the culture, 3) if you can, plug into a church or other local non-St. John's group so that if/when you need to spend time with non-Jonnies you can.\n\nFinally, I hope it goes without saying, but if you do not enjoy reading or books, do not come to St. John's.",

    "postText": "I have often heard people call Hillsdale \"NeoCon U\" I know Churchill, Reagan, and Thatcher are highly regarded at Hillsdale. As a Paleoconservative, I don't really like any of them. I'm a huge fan of Pat Buchanan( him and I have pretty much identical political positions I am extremely socially conservative, an Isolationist on foreign policy, a believer in free-market Capitalism domestically, a Protectionist on trade, very anti-immigration,  and a firm believer in traditional gender roles. ) I read authors like Pat Buchanan, Russell Kirk, Edmund Burke, Paul Gottfried, Julius Evola, Francis Parker Yockey, Sam Francis, and Roger Scruton.   Im a devout Calvinist Anglican. I'm not afraid to have my views challenged, but I want to attend a school where my views will be tolerated, and where there will be people who share my views. . Would I be fine at Hillsdale? ",

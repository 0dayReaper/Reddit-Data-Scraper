Dan is an elected board member for Hillsdale Community Schools, and standard practice is for a member of the School Board to also serve on the Library Board. The School board recommended Dan, and it is now up to City Council to confirm this appointment. \n\nHowever, this confirmation vote is being threatened by Josh Paladino, the very same library board member who attempted to push through an unconstitutional book ban last summer. Josh has since been elected to City Council as well, representing Ward 4. His actions caused an uproar in the community, and several members of the Hillsdale Community Library staff to resign, including the library director who received threats thanks to Mr. Paladino\u2019s baseless claims that targeted her directly. \n\nMr. Paladino and his allies on city council do not want Dan to serve on the library board because they see Dan as a threat to their agenda of imposing Christian Nationalist ideals in the library or removing the library entirely from the community. \n\nDan is an upstanding citizen, a lifelong resident of Hillsdale, and a graduate of Hillsdale High School. He was elected by the residents of Hillsdale County to serve on the board for Hillsdale Community Schools, and therefore the majority of residents trust Dan regarding matters related to our children\u2019s education. Dan\u2019s appointment to the library board should be standard protocol according to the historical precedent of this particular matter, and there is no logical reason for the denial of his appointment by city council. \n\nI urge you to contact your city council members\ufffc, and Mayor Stockford to voice your support of Dan LaRue\u2019s appointment to the Hillsdale Community Library board, and attend tomorrow\u2019s city council meeting if you are able.",

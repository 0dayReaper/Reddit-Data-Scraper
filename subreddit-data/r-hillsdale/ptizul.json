    "postText": "Hi. I am a Junior in high school who is starting to look at colleges. Hillsdale looks like my dream college and I think I would have the best experience there compared to anything else but I\u2019m worried that it won\u2019t set me up for life as better as other schools. My issue is that I know I can do better than Hillsdale. I have a 3.98 gpa, expecting good sat scores, gonna be an Eagle Scout soon, I do varsity sports, and I am going to try to be in the national honors society at my high school. I know I can go to a better school that will set up better in life but I toured UVM and it was super nice and all but they were way too liberal for me. My cousin goes to North Western and he has told me horror stories about how far left they are. I have talked to numerous other people and they told me similar things. I\u2019ve also done research and the only better option it seems in terms of not being extremely far left is Brigham Young University but I don\u2019t want learn about Mormonism. I\u2019d rather go to a leftist school than that. Tell me what you think! Sorry that this is so long and sorry if I told any irrelevant information.",

But I would caution you against choosing Hillsdale exclusively for the political profile. If you don't believe in the liberal arts, you should go somewhere else. You could challenge yourself and grow in and advocate for your beliefs going to a \"leftist\" school.",

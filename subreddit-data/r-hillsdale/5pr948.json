    "postText": "The college started remodeling Mauck last spring, immediately after graduation.  It always had great character, but it was getting run-down (and I never lived there, just visited a few times).\n\nThe remodel looks great!\n\n&gt; Hillsdale\u2019s renovation project added new floors and paint colors to the dorm\u2019s prolific solarium and grand hall, a new full-size kitchen on the main floor with kitchenettes for every hall, community-style bathrooms, new furniture throughout the building, and two new dorm rooms. Forty-three women now live in Mauck, just a few residents shy of the 53-person limit.\n\nhttp://hillsdalecollegian.com/2017/01/mauck-over/",

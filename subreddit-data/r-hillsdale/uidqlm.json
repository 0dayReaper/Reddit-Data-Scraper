    "postText": "Hillsdale\u2019s average for admitting students is 3.89. I want to go to Hillsdale and I always thought that I was good for gpa. I recently found out that most colleges use a 4.0 scale so my gpa is only a 3.71! Does Hillsdale use a 4.0 gpa scale? \n\nI\u2019m really upset about this. It\u2019s really annoying that my high school has this. It\u2019s only making everyone think that they\u2019re better than they really are. I was going to apply to a bunch of really good schools and now I don\u2019t think I should.",

    "postText": "As a Catholic homeschooler who never got any social interaction outside of Steam and Reddit is my Catholic^(R 1492) High School in a small town, I'm wondering if there are any GAY students at Hillsdale. I know Hillsdale is a Conservative^(TM 2015)  place and as my only choices are Bob Jones, Harvard, or Patrick Henry College, I want to know if there are other GAY students at Hillsdale College, or if it's just another dumpy politicized place like all the places my parents are making me apply to.",

            "comment": "I see this post is old, but maybe you will still see it! I went to Hillsdale in the late 80's early 90's. I am gay but was not out then. Hillsdale was very conservative then, but there was a lot of shenanigan's going on, especially in the frat houses. In my graduating class, from my frat alone, there were 3 of us who are gay.\nHowever, the atmosphere changed quite a bit in the years to come. The politically conservative movement there grew into a very right wing Christian conservative atmosphere. When I was there it was conservative, but not the scary Christian conservative part.\n\nI would be very leery about going to school in that atmosphere if I were to do it again. I don't know about Bob Jones or Patrick Henry, but Harvard seems like it would be a good fit.\n\nThere are undoubtedly gay men at Hillsdale, but my guess would be that they try very hard to hide it. Good luck with your journey and your decisions. No matter what it will work out, stay strong.",

Yes, hasty generalization is taking a small sampling and applying it as a generalization to a large population.   \n\nI would say this is the exact opposite.  He is generalizing the public schooling system and there are probably some limited exceptions where public schooling is doing well but the general direction of public schooling has been getting much worse each decade.",

Hillsdale was one of the first schools to allow African Americans to attend and was the second school in America that had a black female get a degree. Also most of male and female students helped the north during the civil war. Can you elaborate how this school teaches narrow mindedness and bigotry? Have you attended a class there? Have you talked to any of the professors? They\u2019re are plenty of liberal and non Christian students who attend. Myself included. I have had some of the most meaningful conversations about humanity at this school.",

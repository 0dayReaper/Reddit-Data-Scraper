I definitely not assuming that people would really care I'm more so am just wondering if there are any other gay students there.",

            "comment": "I attended Hillsdale college briefly while in High School and quite a lot of the people that I got to know were conservative (of course), but of a more modern sort. They like to argue for their ideals, but those who I met weren't homophobic by what I could tell (I even met another Atheist!) My problem with Hillsdale is that there really isn't anything to do around here, and there is no lgbt scene whatsoever. If I remember correctly, the college actively dismantled a gay-straight alliance that was forming on campus, and the Campus Chaplin sent out an email to everyone rallying them to \"pray against the evils of gay marriage.\" Also, if you aren't religious, I wouldn't suggest coming here. While the school has no 'enforced' religious requirement, it seems as if things are going that way. A brand new Chapel is being built right smack in the middle of Campus, and I recall reading an anonymous news letter distributed around the school from students worrying about that very issue. \n\nAs it stands, I would not advise attending Hillsdale College. The town of Hillsdale in general is not particularly friendly to lgbt people, but you're unlikely to be actively \"discriminated\" against. If you do attend, I would try your hardest to get Dr. Stephens as an intro Philosophy professor. The man changed my life. I can't speak for Dr. Schlueter, for any interaction that I had he seemed to be rather pleasant, but the topic of the lgbt community never came up.\n\nI didn't choose Hillsdale mainly for the reasons above. However, I also grew up here, so I might be biased. ",

            "comment": "I am not LGBTQ+, but I had a few gay friends at Hillsdale (mostly closeted, if that's any indication) and I think it was pretty unpleasant. There are a few professors--Dr. Schlueter comes to mind--who are pretty much homophobic. Other professors, like Dr.Blum are sympathetic. Students are relatively accepting, if you find the right crowd (like the Theater/music kids, some party/athletic groups, etc) but yeah, as the other posters say, there are still small groups of people (the smallish Evangelical/fundamental crowd) who are \"horribly homophobic.\"\n\nI think if you have other things in common with the college that will help. If you are not religious or somewhat conservative on some level for instance that will make it more difficult to fit in. \n\nIf you want to send me a private message, I can try to connect you with gay alumni who will have much better insight than me.

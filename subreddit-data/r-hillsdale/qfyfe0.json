    "postText": "I\u2019m a prospective transfer student. I\u2019m hoping someone here can give me some guidance and info about the freshman women\u2019s housing situation. Is there a chance I could get a single room, or just any space alone? Suite with a private space would be fine, anything of that sort as long as I have somewhere to retreat to. I\u2019m willing to pay extra! Is this a pipe dream? I\u2019ve got good reasons: I play jazz harp when I can\u2019t sleep and I\u2019ve lived alone for over a year\u2026",

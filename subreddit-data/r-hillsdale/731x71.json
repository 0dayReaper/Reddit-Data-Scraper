I was wondering is this is a mistake or is Hillsdale is no longer allowing people to download their dialogues? I've always listened to these as a podcast offline.\n\nIs there anyone that can send a word to whoever is in charge of these archives that it's not allowing downloads? I'd do it myself but I don't go to the college (I'm just a filthy free-online-courser) so I have no idea how to get a hold of anyone, if there is even anyone to get a hold of.",

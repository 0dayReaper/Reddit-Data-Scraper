    "postText": "Hey\nI'm considering attending Hillsdale. I had some questions\n1. I often hear people call Hillsdale \"NeoCon U\" I know it's advertised on Limbaughs show.  This worries me. I am a Far-Right Paleoconservative( I idolize Pat Buchanan) I'm a socially conservative, Anti-war, Protectionist.  Are PaleoCons welcome at Hillsdale?\n2. I hear there is a preppy contingent at Hillsdale. Where do they hang out? What clubs/groups should I join if I want to meet fellow preps? \n",

            "comment": "I'm not super conservative myself so I'm not sure about all the views of paleoconservatism, but Hillsdale is one of the only places where you definitely won't get ridiculed for any far-right leanings. So Hillsdale would definitely be the most accepting, if not welcoming, of your political opinions as opposed to any other college.\nIn terms of preppy kids, many students would be considered preppy at Hillsdale. Most come from nice families which tends to lead to this trend. In terms of actual places to look for that in, I would definitely suggest sororities (if a girl) or fraternities (if a guy). Kappa (sorority) or Sigma Chi (fraternity) would be the most preppy places to investigate. I don't know your viewpoint on fraternities (Hillsdale students tend to come in with negative attitudes towards Greek life), but I would like to stress that Greek life here is very different than at other campuses, is very approachable, and actually stands for the values they profess. Either way, I highly recommend doing an overnight stay here (and anywhere else you are highly considering) to get a better feel for campus. ",

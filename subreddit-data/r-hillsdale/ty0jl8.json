    "postText": "Title is self-explanatory. I was waitlisted for Fall 2022 - I'd have been a transfer student, and I didn't think to apply until mid-January. It was the only school I applied to (I have been out of school for over 2 years on a Leave-of-Absence from a different institution). I am interested in studying at Hillsdale because of the Liberal Arts Core (I'd like to improve my critical thinking and writing skills) and because it seems like a place where, socially and in-class I'd actually be allowed to hold/develop/argue opinions that aren't in-line with the Far Left. This is an immense struggle for me socially (I went to a music school in California before, and there was very little diversity of opinion and it was extremely stifling).\n\nI'll ask the admissions person I was in contact with, but does anyone here know whether I could apply again next year (I'd apply early this time)? If not, do you know of any other schools with similar values? I am not a Christian but I am unopposed to attending a Christian school (as long as church attendance isn't a requirement).",

If the rep encourages you to reapply, be sure to do a campus visit (if you haven't already).\n\nIf you are good musician make sure the music department knows, you can even do a tryout during a campus visit. Could mean scholarship money if you are accepted.",

I would also take classes that have to do with American history, the college would love that. If you can, take classes that work on the core, I took Physics, Chemistry, and Biology at a local community college during the summer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you can, I would reach out to a music professor like professor Halleman, to express your interest. Ask if you can shadow a music student. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd if you visit, (and you really should visit) I would try to set up an interview with one of our admissions counselors.",

    "postText": "Yeah, we get it, you don't approve of slow sweet suicide smoking. And we can't deny that the shit smells bad. But the amount of dirty looks one braves by lighting up a fag in front of the library is unnecessary. I conceal my disgust at fat people and caffeine addicts , and would appreciate the same politeness about my own flaws. What really irks me is THAT GUY who takes it upon himself to chase down smokers trying to take away their fag, tries to get smoking banned on campus, and researches the evils of electronic cigarette addiction. NO SHIT SMOKING IS BAD. What are you trying to prove? You're better than everyone? Keep on wearing your ludicrously hypocritical don't tread on me college republicans shirt, it gives us all a laugh. Sincerely nicotine addicts ",

I don't want your secondhand cum all over everything. fucking gross.",

Now THAT is a real epidemic; while smoking may have long term consequences for individual's health, masturbation has immediate consequences for the individual's LIFE. How would that cute girl with the self-knit sweater and braided hair you've been considering as a future wife feel if she knew you had dates with ol' Pamela Handerson 3 times a day?\nI feel such conduct is wholly inappropriate on Hillsdale's campus and a violation of the Honor Code. Furthermore it reflects poorly on the Deans that they have allowed such behavior to flourish. They ought to take immediate steps to ensure students stop spanking the monkey on campus owned property.",

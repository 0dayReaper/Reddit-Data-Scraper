    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'd like to connect with people who have started a Hillsdale Member school, or who are in process. I am at the \\*very\\* beginning stages and would love any advice or suggestions. Currently, I'm wondering how to do market research to find out if there's a population in my area who would be interested in sending their kids. (Mine are all nearly grown!) But any information on how to start would be valuable!\n\nThanks!",

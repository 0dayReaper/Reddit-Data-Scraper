    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI was thinking about trying to get into Hillsdale College, specifically with the long-term goal of entering the school's Politics Ph.D program. But I'm a bit uncertain about the job prospects available to graduates of such a program.\n\nI'm told that the job market for all humanities Ph.Ds is quite dour. But a survey of the student profiles at the HC website's Graduate School of Statesmanship page indicates that most of the dear fellows in that program intend to go into academia in one form or another. A few want to be policy analysts, I think. (See link)\n\nNow, is there a specific advantage to having an advanced degree from a place like Hillsdale, given its high status in the world of conservative politics? What do you guys know?",

He is now teaching politics at college somewhere in the Southern US. \n\nThe PhD program hasn't been around that long, so it is hard to draw too many conclusions. The nice thing about the graduate program is that (at least right now) if you are accepted you get some sort of assistantship, so you get paid and tuition is waived.",

It probably closes a lot more. \n\nThe HC PHD does not have the same prestige in those conservative circles as the regular BA or BS does. The standards for admittance are.....??? (crickets). If you want your pick of jobs challenge yourself to go to the best school you can get into.",

I'm talking about the standards for admittance. Read for yourself - there is basically nothing written ( [https://www.hillsdale.edu/academics/graduate-school/](https://www.hillsdale.edu/academics/graduate-school/) ) which means that they probably take anyone who applies. Unfortunately, in the world that we live in, much of the prestige of a graduate program is based on the level and amount of students that are rejected for admission.",

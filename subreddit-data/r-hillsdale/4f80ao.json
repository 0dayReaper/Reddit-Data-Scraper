    "postText": "I know Hillsdale isn't technically a Christian school. That worries me a bit. I'm a devout Anglican.  I'm looking for a college with an extremely religious student body. I want to be around students who are devout in their faith. I want to AVOID things like fornication and sodomy. I want a school where the girls are chaste. Would Hillsdale fit me in that regard? I'm also looking at Patrick Henry College and New St. Andrews College.",

            "comment": "Hillsdale is more diverse (and much more intellectually varied) than you would be comfortable with, after looking through your post history. \n\nWhile the student body is largely Christian, there is no social pressure to conform. Austrian economics is closer to a religion than anything else on campus.\n\nThere are also gay, atheist, and liberal students on campus, and while there is an honor code, premarital sex is neither prohibited nor uncommon.\n\nLooking for a bubble like you describe is intellectually unhealthy and a parallel to the 'safe spaces' you probably deride.

    "postText": "At the beginning of my Junior year of high school, I did a post on this subreddit before asking if Hillsdale is worth it because I can get into better places. Unfortunately, now I am not doing as well. I still have all A\u2019s except two grades that are pretty low and I am trying really hard to get those up (I had Covid and was out for a while and I think that has something to do with it). Anyways, since I am not doing as well this school year, Hillsdale is more on my radar now but I am worried that I might not get in. I have two questions. \n\n1. It says on some website that the average gpa of high schoolers getting into Hillsdale is 3.89. Is that weighted or unweighted? Currently, I have a weighted 3.98 and expect for it to barely get over 4.0 by the end of this school year. (The two classes I said I was struggling in are both IB so it won\u2019t hurt my gpa too bad. Plus I\u2019ll get them up.) \n\n2. It also said on the website that I should have mostly A\u2019s. Does that count A- or just 93 and above? \n\nAs other things, I play boys varsity lacrosse (I know Hillsdale doesn\u2019t have a lacrosse team but I heard varsity sports regardless are good and show commitment). I will also be an Eagle Scout soon. I also expect to get around 1400 on the SAT. So what are my chances generally? Probably gonna post on this subreddit 1 or 2 more times so I hope none of you mind. Thanks.",

But my application was much more focused on leadership, volunteering, and hard work rather than straight academics.\n\nI worked all 4 years, did a lot of volunteer work and went on to lead multiple student groups. I think there is a need for both really smart students, and also those that have a wide breadth of experiences and background.\n\nAll this to say, work had in school, but I wouldn't recommend putting all your eggs in the academic basket.",

I think that out of the pool of applicants that have average grades and scores, Hillsdale selects those that it feels would fit best with its classical, conservative community, so those who demonstrate those values in their essays, interviews, and extracurriculars.  \n\nSome things that I think helped me in my application:\n~Demonstrated academic interest and curiosity \u201cbeyond the utilitarian level\u201d. In my interview, I talked a lot about my independent study of politics and what I had learned. \n\n~Quite obviously conservative. Pro-life lobbying at my state\u2019s House of Representatives was one of my extracurriculars, as well as mentioning conservatism positively in my interview and essays. This is very important to Hillsdale: I believe two of the interview questions were directly related to politics/conservatism.  \n\n~Speculation, but taking the CLT (Classical Learning Test) instead of one of the regular tests might have helped me?\n\nHillsdale is becoming much harder to get into as years pass due to increased applicant volume, so it\u2019s not a safety school by any means, but if you write good essays and interview well, you should have a decent chance. \nIf you have any more questions, feel free to DM me!",

            "comment": "As a current freshman at Hillsdale, I can tell you that the admissions process has become increasingly competitive. However, unlike some other institutions, Hillsdale values your interview, extra-curriculars, and volunteer work as integral parts of your application. Therefore, your soon-to-be Eagle Scout status and sports involvement will look great on your application and increase your chances.\n\nAs far as your more specific questions, Hillsdale uses weighted GPAs, so I am assuming the 3.89 is weighted. The difference between an A or an A- will be dependent on your school, so if your institution grants A's for 90% and above (as mine did), all Hillsdale will see is your A, which will correspond to a 4.0.\n\nHowever, the previous years have seen a steep increase in applicants, and therefore a steep decrease in acceptance rates. Acceptance has gone from 46% in 2019-2020, to 24% for the 2021-2022 academic year. Therefore, simply do your best in your remaining classes, study hard for the SAT (Khan Academy is very helpful), participate in volunteering and extracurriculars, and leave the rest to God.",

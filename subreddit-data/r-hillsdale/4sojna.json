Anyways, there are various reasons why I ultimately chose Hillsdale, but I don't feel like disclosing them atm. I was very very unhappy with my decision, and still am to some extent, but I decided that if I cannot bare the school one bit, I'll transfer out pronto. I appreciate your suggestions, and will consider them if necessary.",

There are extremely wealthy students, and those who are paying their own way. There are those on full ride academic scholarships and those that flunk out after the first year. There are those that are into sports, and those who get hurt just thinking about sports. There are those from Michigan can those from Hawaii.\n\nAll this to say, Hillsdale is extremely diverse from cultural and economic backgrounds. I would say that the student body is fairly religious and that most students practice a religion. Though there are plenty of atheists and agnostics too.",

If I attend Hillsdale, that'll be the group I want to join. What groups do these kids join? Are they usually in Greek life? I'm an extremely preppy/cultured guy, but I'm also very religious and very serious about my academics.( I'm in no way a nerd. I'd call myself a preppy scholar.) Would I fit in with the \"wealthy kids\" at Hillsdale?\n",

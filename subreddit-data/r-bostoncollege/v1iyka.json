You don't have to *stay* in every group, but sample a lot of opportunities.\n\nMeeting people builds friendships, but is also a good way to find future roommates, study partners, jobs, dating partners, and more.\n\n**Sitting alone in your room sucks.**\n\nAnd anyway, if you're international, all the American kids think you're terribly exotic and interesting, even if you're from someone that you think is boring! :7)",

            "comment": "Idk what your housing process is like as a transfer but for sophomore year, most students go for suites, particularly 8-man suites, which are also the most available. Some sophomores try to go for on-campus apartments instead, which give you a full kitchen over a kitchenette, however, they\u2019re mostly filled by juniors and seniors, and they don\u2019t have the same mandatory meal plan as the suite and traditional style dorms have for sophomores, so depending on whether you\u2019d rather cook more or just go to the dining hall you may want to consider that. \n\nAs the other commenter said, joining clubs and attending events is a great way to meet people. I\u2019d also add, don\u2019t feel pressured to join clubs that are related more heavily to your major. If something interests you, go for it. One of my favorite groups on campus is a club I joined that\u2019s completely unrelated to my major but was just an interest of mine and I met some of my favorite people on campus through that. \n\nAlso, as a rising sophomore, congrats and welcome to BC! If you have any questions feel free to follow up or dm me!",

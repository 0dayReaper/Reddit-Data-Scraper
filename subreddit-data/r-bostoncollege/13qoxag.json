Or would I have to wait until May for it to say the degree has been awarded?",

If you use extra credits to graduate early, you have to pay for them. Summer classes you pay for as you go so those aren\u2019t an issue but if you have 16, 17, and 18 credit semesters and use those extra credits you pay for them when you accelerate.",

That\u2019s why I was wondering if the degree would be awarded once the degree requirements have been met or at graduation.",

You\u2019ll make friends in your dorm, classes, and through clubs you join!",

Go to all the events, talk to people, wave and say hi to everyone even if they're that one kid you met at the beginning of the year standing in a line who you'll probably never see in a personal setting.\n\nWhat worked for me, personally, is I went to a lot of clubs beginning of the year and then I focused on the ones where I really liked the people even if I disagreed with the club itself. Invite people out for weekend outings (e.g a shopping trip, newbury street, etc) or one-on-ones (they're really common and an awesome way to get to know someone you're not close to). \n\nYou'll learn which clubs are incredibly cliquey and not. If you join one of them, then you made really great friends. However, if you want to be close friends with people in the club and you're not a part of it...you're probably not going to be all that close of a friend to them.\n\nLiterally just go up to people and introduce yourself and ask them about yourself. That's how I made some of my closest friends. I would join random tables during lunch or just see someone standing alone so I would go up to them and talk.",

I thought I could make friends without trying because that's what I've been able to do my whole life, but I was really lonely my first semester after transferring in. Go to clubs, events, everything. BC is really cliquey and you'll only have success if you put yourself out there.",

Everyone at my Greek life school was so friendly and outgoing and no I did not even partake in Greek life there. Yes BC is cliquey even though it has no Greek life. Everyone\u2019s all up on their high horse and too stuck up to say hi to people in classes. No wonder this school specifically has the \u201cBC lookaway\u201d culture. It literally sucks to have to work in group projects here because kids here are so anti social. I thought BC having no Greek life would make it better socially but boy was I wrong.",

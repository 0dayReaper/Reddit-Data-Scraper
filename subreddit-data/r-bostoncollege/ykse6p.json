I want to take the class next semester, and I\u2019m currently leaning towards Leuger or Meyer, but I would love any insights about these profs or other ones and what their classwork entails! Thanks",

She was understanding that the class was used as a CORE by a lot of students, and as long as you put in some small effort (even just raising hand once per class, eye contact with her, etc.) she was super understanding and lenient grader. I was a CS major who ended up really enjoying the class!",

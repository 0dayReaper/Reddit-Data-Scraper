    "postText": "Hey guys, I am new here. Anyone in the mental health counseling masters program? I got accepted with a 30% tuition scholarship, which is really good, so I am trying to gather info about the program itself. Is it good? How hard/busy is a typical semester? How about professors and cohorts? Practicum? Any current students want to share their experience?\n\nAlso, Are the programs ranking or accreditation considered when you graduate and go into supervised counseling your first year? How does it compare to other mhc programs? where do u even find reliable rankings/admission stat/cohort profile? Also the 30% tuition scholarship, is this a really rare and good opportunity? Just curious!",

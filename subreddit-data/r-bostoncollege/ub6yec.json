There were a lot of shared courses, so we'd just be able to tag along to the crazy schmoozy networking events, which definitely worked well for starting a career.  \n  \nBut then, there was definitely a lot of technical catch-up after graduating (which, honestly, wasn't a big deal, since you wind up learning a specific technical domain for your job, anyway).",

You can take gen chem and maybe a bio alongside CS classes and see how you feel. I think the CS program here is pretty good, there's some bad professors but its mostly about what you put into it and the projects you make on the side.",

If you're looking to be a hard core engineer at Google, it might not be right for you. But I run a business applications team for a large consumer brand you'd recognize - and I'd take BC grads all day long because I can put them in front of finance people, marketing people, etc. It's a lucrative niche, and not a lot of people can do it well.",

During my time at BC i often worried if i was getting the technical training to stack up with peers that i would be competing with for jobs in the future.  Looking back, the skills i developed around communication, teamwork, attention to detail, and a million other not-exclusively-tech-based fronts have propelled me way more than anything else.  Caveat - my career path took me to more of a tech/functional/project management path - decidedly NOT a hardcore engineering path",

With that said, I think there\u2019s some great opportunities to do CS as a double major here. Plus, worst case scenario, while the program on its own may be a little subpar, BC is a well-regarded and very well-connected school, so there\u2019s still plenty of opportunity here regardless. So long as you\u2019re good with that going in, you\u2019ll have nothing to worry about, especially if you enjoy campus and the student life here",

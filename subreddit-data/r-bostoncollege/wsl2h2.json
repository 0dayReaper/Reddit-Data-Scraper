It was a pretty small place compared to the actual climbing gyms in Boston we went to later, but it\u2019s definitely good. Rentals for shoes were free, I just had to sign a waiver for my first time. They didn\u2019t have any chalk, but my friend brought some.\n\nThe wall has been closed for renovations for a while, but I believe it should be reopening soon in the fall with completely new routes. My friend works on the wall and said they\u2019re integrating ropes for belaying too.",

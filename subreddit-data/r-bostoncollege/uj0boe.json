    "postText": "Long story short I got deferred then waitlisted. I sent a Letter of Continued Interest and made sure to stay somewhat up to date with my admission officer. I recently called the admissions office and they told me that most of the spots for the upcoming freshman class are already filled and they likely won't be pulling from the waitlist (at least for early/mid May) but they will be keeping it open in case more people than they expect end up changing their minds.\n\nIs there any hope for me to get off the waitlist still? If they only accept 5 people off the waitlist, I'd love to be one of those people. Does anyone have any insight on the matter? Maybe a past experience with waitlists?",

            "comment": "Every school and every year is very different, and it\u2019s really hard to predict whether a school will go to their waitlist. Schools have a number of incoming freshmen that they want to have, and wait lists are used when a school is worried that they won\u2019t meet that number. Now that BC has early decision (which is a commitment to attend the school if accepted), they have more assurance that they\u2019ll meet their numbers, and they may have filled a large portion of the class through this. It\u2019s definitely worth writing a letter, talking to your guidance counselor, calling for updates, etc but it\u2019s just so hard to predict. I was waitlisted at my dream school and it didn\u2019t work out after letters, personal connections, transcript updates, etc, that school filled more than half of their class with ED, but I do know others that got in from wait lists at BC and elsewhere (this was 6+ years ago). Definitely continue to try for BC\u2019s waitlist if it\u2019s what you want, but don\u2019t forget to at least try to get excited about the school you\u2019ve chosen in the meantime! I did not do that and spent my summer bummed about my other school, and it made my transition to BC way harder than it needed to be.",

With your savings, tour Europe one month of (if not every month) summer during college.  \n\nI liked bc and loved boston.   But part of me wishes I did the state school /  tour Europe plan instead.",

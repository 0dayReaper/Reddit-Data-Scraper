It's pretty dangerous to trust expertise of random anonymous people on the internet.  \n  \n[Here's their contact info](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/admission/visit/contact-admission.html). Seriously, they're very helpful!  \n  \nWhile you're more than welcome to ask questions about student life or academics if you need help making a decision, we'll start removing things like:  \n  \n- Are X scores good enough?  \n- Should I include Y thing?  \n- When is Z going to happen?  \n  \nUse this as a barometer: **Feel free to ask your question if it's something you might ask some random student you found walking across the quad.**  \n  \nIf you're uncertain, you can always [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/bostoncollege). If there's super high demand for a particular piece of info, we can probably help out. And a reminder that we have a wiki and, in particular, [guidelines for prospective applicants](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostoncollege/wiki/index#wiki_rules_for_admissions-related_posts).",

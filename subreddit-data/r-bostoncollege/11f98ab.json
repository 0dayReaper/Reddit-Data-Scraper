    "postText": "I graduated from BC a few years ago and feel like it never really helped me land a job. I actually had to work dumb jobs after college like receptionist out of desperation.\n\nI have friends who went to other schools but make a lot of money in sales (tech sales or recruiter). They are intelligent and personable. However, I don\u2019t really see people after BC get into sales, unless I\u2019m mistaken.\n\nIs this an uncommon path after BC? Am wondering if anyone can share experiences.",

For example, you could have been in the sales club and would have had opportunities to do sale. \n\nIn terms of tech sales, bc absolutely doesn\u2019t send A TON of people into tech sales cause we are an crusty school that has students go into my trad professions like real estate. That being said, there are definitely people making good money from bc in real estate sales",

The only thing it will help with is when you\u2019re being compared to a candidate with similar work experience. In the same boat, if you didn\u2019t work during college, they would choose someone who did even if they didn\u2019t go to as good as a school. Employers don\u2019t care you your grades or where you went really (unless you\u2019re in stem) they care what kind of work experience you have. Which the sad part most people don\u2019t realize, by the time you graduate you need at least 2 years experience which you can get if you hustle while in college.",

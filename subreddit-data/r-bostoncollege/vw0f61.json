I just feel like not a lot of people take classes beyond what is required of their concentration anyways. I guess they might also be trying to encourage students to take more MCAS classes",

Lots of people pick up CS with their concentrations, and especially seeing as info systems is being dropped for anyone past class of \u201825 it\u2019ll probably be more useful/popular. It\u2019s not the only example but that\u2019s the best one off the top of my head.\n\nPlus, while it may make some sense for business in general it doesn\u2019t line up with BC\u2019s goals. BC likes to focus on making well-rounded students and covering a range of topics, which is why they do things like drop some CSOM requirements with MCAS majors and minors, and have everyone take the university core. It\u2019s not the same as somewhere like Bentley where it\u2019s just focused on business.",

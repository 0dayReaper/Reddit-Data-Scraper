Description:

Reddit's oldest and largest community for all things Boston College. Join thousands of other Eagles to discuss Boston College academics, athletics, and nearby happenings.

Rules:

Respect: Show respect &amp; courtesy. Be civil. Be welcoming. This is your community; if you don't take pride in that fact, this probably isn't the right subreddit for you.

Harassment: Don't harass other users. This includes doxxing, trolling, witch hunting, brigading, shitstirring, uncivil behavior, insults, and/or user impersonation. If you think it could break the rules, it probably does. If someone is harassing you in a thread, tell the mods and provide a link. If someone is harassing you in private, tell the Reddit admins. Egregious documented harassing of other users (especially in racist, sexist, and/or homophobic manner) may lead to being banned.

No Advertising: No self/link posts that constitute advertising. No crowdfunding, petitions, coupons, referral programs, self-affiliated business, event, or service promoting. Promo codes, giveaways, surveys, and paid/unpaid studies are also considered advertisement. Habitually linking to one's personal blog, Podcast, youtube channel, band's soundcloud or similar sites, digital art portfolio, social media outposts, and text-based promotional content is not allowed.

Reasonable Topics: Keep it BC-related. Don't post vague discussion topics. Intentionally inflammatory or low-effort posts are subject to removal. Posting about BC events happening on or off campus is perfectly welcome

Admissions: No /r/chanceme -like questions. [More info on our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostoncollege/wiki/index).

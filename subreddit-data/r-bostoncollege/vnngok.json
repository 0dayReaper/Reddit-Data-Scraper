            "comment": "Read over my past comments as I\u2019ve talked about here. I\u2019m in dental school now (multiple classmates who were in it with me are now in Ph.D and med school programs) and overall I think it\u2019s very worth taking. The only bad part of the program is that due to it being pretty rigorous (wayyy harder than the normal classes), your gpa could suffer. \n\nIdk who\u2019s teaching it now but when I took it it was Professor Liu, Byers, and Weerapana. (Spans for 4 semesters) \n\nHere\u2019s one of my old comments:\n\n\u201cHey sorry for the late post. I finished the honors chemistry track and I think it definitely helped me get into dental school. If you\u2019re willing to work hard, I would definitely recommend doing it. If you don\u2019t like the track, just drop it and take the regular ones during add drop week.\n\nTo answer your question, I think most of my classmates in the honors class were some of the smartest people I met in college (got into great PhD programs) and probably had really high SAT and AP Chem grades. I think I was an anomaly since I got a 3 on the AP chem test and only a 720 on the SAT chem subject test. However I still did very well in the course. \n\nPeople are going to tell you that health profession school applications are a gpa game, but I think the honors chemistry track really brightens up your transcript. Even if you get lower grades than the regular ones, it\u2019s obvious that you challenged yourself right out of the gate. Additionally, schools will know that these honors courses are harder than the standard classes and will give you more leeway. My academic advisor told me that a B+ in honors chemistry courses were viewed as A\u2019s. \n\nAside from the whole gpa thing, the honors chemistry course provides you with research and faculty connections to further boost your overall application. They basically guarantee a research position for you during your sophomore year but being a honors chemistry student gives you higher chances to join a lab if you want to pursue research earlier (this is what I did). \n\nMessage me if you have any further questions!\u201d",

            "comment": "If you have a natural aptitude and knack for Chemistry and think you'll do well, go for it. Medical schools enjoy people who have explored their interests/passions and worked hard to refine them.\n\nBut BC Chem is hard as it is, imo; as much as it's uncomfortable to state, yes, medical school admissions is truly a GPA game. These are also 4 credit courses, meaning if you do less-than-stellar in one or a few of these classes, it'll leave more damage to your GPA. \n\nTo get an idea of the pace of it, Honors Chem will essentially have you starting Orgo your spring semester of freshman year (when you'd normally take it during the fall of sophomore year). So, you are covering 2 semesters' worth of material in 1 semester. \n\nMaybe the BC committee views a B+ in an honors course as an A, but they're not the ones who have the final say on your application to medical schools. \"Completion of challenging upper-level science courses\" was rated as being of \"medium importance\" to medical school admissions committees as opposed to your GPA, which was given the highest rating.

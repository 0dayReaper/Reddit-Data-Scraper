    "postText": "Hello! I will be graduating in May and moving out by the end of the month, so my roommate and I are looking for someone to move into my unit starting in the month of June. Subletting is not permitted in our building, so we ideally want to prioritize potential roommates who intend to remain on the lease from this June through the end of the next lease period (i.e., until August 2024). Some general info:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment in Brighton\u00a0\n* Rent: $1,075/mo per person currently (June, July, August); increasing to $1,125/mo per person in September\n* Utilities (gas + electric): &lt;$50/mo per person\n* Wifi: $15/mo per person\n* Location: right across the street from the Sutherland Rd. T stop (green line) \u2014 super easy access to BU and BC campuses! Also across the street from 2 pharmacies, a caf\u00e9, a pizza place, a gym, an Indian restaurant, a barber shop, and a convenience/liquor store.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome added perks: laundry in building ($1.75 per wash/dry load), elevator, dishwasher, great view of golden hour :) My unit is currently furnished with a bed frame / mattress (size: full/double), desk, chair, bookshelf, and closet storage, and I am open to selling those items to the new tenant at discounted prices!\n\nPlease message me for more information about my roomate / the unit, or for photos of the unit! We are hoping to sign someone asap!",

    "postText": "I was admitted to Cox at SMU but I'm also really interested in the Carroll School of Management at BC. I really like the idea of BC since I've lived in and really liked Boston as a city and the campus + school are really great. Does anyone know what the social scene is like now and would you recommend it? I'm really considering ED 2 right now but on the fence. Thanks.",

That\u2019s not a knock on SMU - they probably have a great base in their geographical area. But if you want to be in New York, the BC degree will help you more than SMU.",

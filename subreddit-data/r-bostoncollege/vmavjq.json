I came from a competitive public hs and I was pretty average",

            "comment": "Regarding academics, prep, courses and profs, it really depends on what your major is. Some are much easier than others, so how difficult classes are can wildly vary from person to person. Similarly, each major has its own best classes and professors, so it\u2019s tough to say in general, though if you say what you\u2019re studying I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a better answer.\n\nSocially, the best thing for most people to do is join clubs and groups. Especially without Greek life, clubs are some of the biggest social groups on campus, and there\u2019s a lot of options out there. I\u2019d recommend going to the involvement fair, finding a few clubs that line up with your interests, and going to a meeting or two. Everyone has a different experience but it can be a great way to meet people and make new friends, especially since they may not all be concentrated into similar majors like they may be in some classes.",

As is it\u2019s pretty hard to respond to vague questions like \u201cwhat courses do you recommend\u201d\u2014there are hundreds",

The history department is great, for what it\u2019s worth.\n\nThe way I judge classes is twofold: how \u201chard\u201d they are in terms of the amount of work and how \u201chard\u201d they are to get an A in. I personally don\u2019t think history is a hard major in terms of the latter at all, but there is a fair bit of reading/writing so I\u2019d say it\u2019s hard in that former sense\u2014especially if you\u2019re not used to it. CSOM Econ is harder than MCAS Econ, but neither are impossible from what I understand. Bio is very hard, period.\n\nPublic high schools really vary. Some of the ones near me in California were known for being very rigorous but others were complete jokes, it really depends. I personally went to a pretty hard private school and have found BC to be very manageable, but absolutely everything depends on your specific professors. Do your research before picking classes, both on ratemyprofessor and on BC\u2019s internal ratings site. I do this before each semester and it is absolutely critical to ensuring you have 1) professors who are engaging and 2) professors who are reasonable/easy. There\u2019s usually some overlap that\u2019s not too hard to scope out.\n\nAgain, feel free to PM me if you have more specific questions.",

            "comment": "1. As for draining\u2026 it honestly depends on how much pressure you put on yourself. For ex: if you\u2019re in CSOM, getting a B isn\u2019t too strenuous, but an A May tire you out especially if there\u2019s a professor that follows the designated curve strictly. \n\n2. Have fun! Rest. Get in the school mindset quickly though haha.\n\n3. I recommend knocking out your core early on especially philosophy and theology (most classes in this category are veryyy manageable academically and even interesting). Be careful what time you choose though\u2026 9AMs will kill MWFs. \n\n4. As for studying, hit the library between your classes. Get your work done and then don\u2019t stay too late. Avoid procrastinating\u2014the classics: visit office hours (some classes value participation!), TA hours, read your textbook, don\u2019t procrastinate, etc;",

I met many new friends sophomore year who I hadn\u2019t otherwise met freshman year, and new people each year after that. It\u2019s a matter of time and intentionally putting yourself in situations to meet new people and going out on a limb to initiate hangouts.",

Freshman year can be difficult to find your grove, being that everything is new to you. Transferring to another college may just repeat this same cycle. Try to put yourself out there, don\u2019t isolate, and give yourself and BC a chance.",

I looked at your post history and it sounds like you've been struggling for a while. If possible, it might be best to transfer closer to your support network. No school is worth your health. \n\nPlease take care of yourself.",

There's no silver bullet for making connections with people - it just takes some big courageous steps to be willing to put yourself out there, whether you do that here, or another school.  \n  \nNow, if there's a program that you think will motivate you at a different school, by all means, something like that might be more than enough reason to transfer. Or, if you already have friends at whatever other place you're looking, that could obviously help, as well.  \n  \nThere's nothing wrong with you for struggling with this - it's something many people deal with, so I hope you don't feel like you're somehow \"failing\".",

But only if there is something about this school specifically that you think is a reason for/cause of you being unable to find the right people. if not then i think transferring won\u2019t solve the problem. you haven\u2019t really explained your issue beyond the fact that you haven\u2019t made friends so it\u2019s difficult for me to help you beyond this rlly",

I waited it out as best as I could and Transferring to impressive schools can get more challenging as a junior. Seems like everyone already had circles and is not that interesting in expanding the group. I think it gets worst the longer you wait, unfortunately, it is probably not you, you just didn't encounter the right people.",

I was also very sick my freshman year and needed to have major brain surgery pretty soon after the school year ended and everyone else at BC seemed to have picture perfect lives. It can be hard to make friends with just whoever you end up rooming with or other students on your floor. \n\nMy closest friends at BC ended up being 2 people from a different club I was in... one had actually been in my orientation group and the other was a freshman my first sophomore year (I ended up having to withdraw/take a medical leave of absence when I returned the semester following my aforementioned surgery). She was in this club that I remained involved with throughout my LOA (I lived only 45 min or so from campus) and she was a nursing student, as was I, so I basically told her \"you're my friend now\" and 19 years later she's one of 2 people I still regularly keep in touch with from BC.",

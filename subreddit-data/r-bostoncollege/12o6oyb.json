Using a combination of lectures, case studies, readings and outside speakers, the course provides students the opportunity to get grounded in each of the CSOM concentrations while gaining outside views on careers in related fields and industries. The course will also provide a framework to explore and discuss cross-functional issues that impact business strategy and execution. This is a highly interactive class that places a premium on both preparation and participation each week. The course is initially open to CSOM sophomores but normally has availability for juniors and seniors across all undergraduate majors\n \n\nI took it in 2019. It was a 2.5 hr class once a week. First half was a Harvard Business School case discussion, 2nd half was someone in that profession would come in and offer their opinion on the case, and you also asked them questions. If you're even slightly interested in business I think it is a great introduction to many different fields. Also a presentation for final, good for practice.",

Its a graduate class so I think you have to get permission from your advisor but its well worth it. Meets once a week and its incredibly interesting. Its taught by two practitioners who literally wrote the book on the topic. Also financial policy with Helen Peters was a lot of work but well worth it.",

            "comment": "I had Tristan this past semester for CS1 and it wasn\u2019t a good class. The man is very passionate about CS, but he\u2019s not good at explaining things at a beginner level. The class went super fast, and oftentimes the theory and homework was far above what CS1 was supposed to cover. So much so that he even had to cancel the homework one week. Quite a few people also dropped the class (one of my friends included) after he told them that they couldn\u2019t get a good grade, and a lot of these people weren\u2019t slackers by any means either.\n\nHopefully he\u2019s better for the future, but that\u2019s been my experience at least. Not a good beginner teacher, maybe good for higher level classes when you know more about CS.\n\nTaking aviram next semester for CS2, but can\u2019t say anything yet.",

I wouldn\u2019t say either was exceptional, and they each could\u2019ve done a better job explaining topics in lectures. However, if you either knew a bit already or could pick up code easily/teach yourself well, the assignments weren\u2019t too bad from either of them. Of the two, I\u2019d say I liked Griffith\u2019s class more, although it could\u2019ve also been due to the difference from CS1 to CS2.",

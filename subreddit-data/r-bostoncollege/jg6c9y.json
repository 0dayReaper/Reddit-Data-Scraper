Sure there are some problems; the food can be ass at times, but there are also some days when I genuinely enjoy the meals.  This subreddit suffers, like most things online, from negativity bias.  People love to highlight the bad things, but this school is really wonderful in my opinion and I love it here.  Couldn't ask for a better school.",

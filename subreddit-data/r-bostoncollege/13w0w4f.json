            "comment": "I don't know how exactly the core requirement works, or what's the complete list of courses that you can take to satisfy the requirement. I've taught MATH1100 Calculus I for three times. I've also taught MATH1004 Finite Probability once. I know that many students take these two courses for the core requirement. I have no idea if there are other courses that can also satisfy the core requirements. Probably there are.\n\nI can compare these two courses for you from the perspective of an instructor who taught these courses in recent years. (I won't be your instructor though because I'm not assigned to teach these courses in the coming academic year)\n\nBoth courses have something difficult about them, but what's difficult about them is very different.\n\nFor Calculus I, the most difficult thing is pre-calculus stuff. My students in the Calculus I classes usually have no issue with actual calculus-related content, whether they have previous calculus background or not. But they often struggle with the pre-calculus stuff that the math department often assume them to know before going to college, for example how to add fractions together, how trigonometry works, etc. In exams, most of the points lost are usually due to pre-calculus stuff rather than actual calculus content.\n\nFor Finite Probability, the most difficult part is the need to think by yourself rather than just follow standard methods taught by the instructor. In this course, sometimes you're expected to think and come up with ways to solve a problem rather than being shown how to solve an almost identical problem. In the classes, you'll be taught tools and concepts that help you, but sometimes you'll need to figure out how to use them by yourself. Thinking skills are part of the assessment. The calculation and algebra stuff in this course is usually very easy though. The difficult part is figuring out \"what to do\", not \"how to do\" something. In this course you have to actually understand the concepts. Just remembering methods and reproducing them blindly won't work.\n\nIf you have to choose between these two courses, probably you should consider factors like whether you are good at logic or thinking about logic riddles. Those who are good at following instructions but bad at logic will probably find Calculus I easier. Those who are good at thinking but bad at calculation/algebra techniques will probably find Finite Probability (no pun intended) easier.",

It was more puzzle logic almost, very unique stuff and almost no actual math involved (just a little bit exploring a basic encryption algorithm). The point of the course, according to the professor, was to have fun exploring some of the lesser-known, less number-oriented sides of mathematics. I completely loved it. However, the outside-the-box and abstract thinking was on the heavier side. The people who invested the time to understand the lessons and homework found it easy, and I found it much easier than Calc I as I am not a math person either.",

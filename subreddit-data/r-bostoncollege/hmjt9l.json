There is a pandemic, mass unemployment, and most likely a prolonged recession and they decide to hit us up with a 9% increase. Other schools, like Williams, are cutting tuition. I swear what a lack of leadership. There is literally a pandemic, If the school is not using the 2.5 Billion endowment now what are they saving it for? Judgement Day? Are those with the biggest endowments  reserved a special place in heaven?",

(Which they set in March 2020 right before covid pandemic). \n\nBut after the covid situation they added 4k to that 75k, I'm assuming because of testing costs and to make up for the lost money from refunds. \n\n[https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/bcnews/campus-community/announcements/tuition-2020-21.html](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/bcnews/campus-community/announcements/tuition-2020-21.html)",

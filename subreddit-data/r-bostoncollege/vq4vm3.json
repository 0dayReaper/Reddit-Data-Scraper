It usually shows up on degree audit (a section within agora portal), but that could take a little bit. If they don\u2019t show up in the fall you can always talk to your advisor about it and they should be able to help you.",

As long as you know you have a qualifying score, it\u2019s just a logistics thing of having them show up, it won\u2019t stop you from whatever you\u2019re trying to do. It\u2019s not like you have to take Freshman Writing if your AP Lang score doesn\u2019t show up correctly before you register as long as it eventually makes its way on there.",

Regardless, they were all accounted for by the end of the first semester, and since they\u2019re all on your college board profile, even if there\u2019s a logistical error it should be possible to iron out",

    "postText": "Hello! I have been recently accepted into BC and was wondering if there were any important pros and cons about the school that you think I should know that from a students perspective that otherwise wouldn't be known unless you enroll in BC. I would appreciate it if you are completely holistic since I will be able to weigh the positives and negatives to the best of my knowledge. \nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "It's difficult to say this in the abstract; I think you'll get better answers if you focus your questions on specific topics, after all, all of us went to college only once. That said, here are some things I really love about BC, and some things I wish it were better at:\n\n**I Love:**\n\n1. **The Service Focus** \u2013 everybody volunteers here, and there's a very real sense that you're not just here to make fat stacks of cash, but you're here for something greater. (\u201cMen and Women for others\u201d)\n2. **The Liberal arts education** \u2013 you get exposed to a large variety of coursework, and while you can (and will) specialize, a bachelor's degree should let you read broadly, and you will at BC.\n3. **The Faculty** \u2013 Some of the best mentors of my life have been professors at BC, and BC is among the best schools in the world in my field. I'm grateful to know them.\n\n  \n**I wish it were better at:**\n\n1. **Being Racially Diverse** \u2013 BC is a very white institution, and while it's better now, it's still got a long way to go. On the one hand, I want more eagles of color, but I'd want to ask a PoC what sort of thing they want out of their education.\n2. **The Drinking Culture** \u2013 I can't drink for medical reasons, and while I wasn't completely left out at BC, it definitely was a hindrance.\n3. **Being Nice vs Being Kind** \u2013 BC is a very *nice* school, in that people are generally OK with etiquette. It can take more for people to be *real* and *kind*, although how much of that is people getting past the barriers of being far from home and how much of that is inculcated is difficult to judge.",

            "comment": "Coming from a rural, low-income background, something I\u2019ve really enjoyed is how focused/committed people are to their education and professional development. Where I\u2019m from, that culture just didn\u2019t exist, largely because the resources and opportunities to facilitate that sort of thing were relatively minimal. So the way I liked to nerd out about certain things and my personal drive to do the best that I can for myself were things that endeared me to others instead of ostracizing me from others, and I\u2019m very grateful for that, because it\u2019s done wonders for my self-confidence and my social life.\n\nBut this is a school that\u2019s really suited for people who are straight, white, and no poorer than upper-middle class. If you miss just one of these boxes, you\u2019ll definitely feel it. Being white, I can\u2019t speak personally about what it\u2019s like to be a racial minority on campus, but there\u2019s usually at least one racially-motivated hate crime every year or two, and a lot of people here aren\u2019t exactly antiracist, to put it mildly. I can speak from experience that the queer community on campus is pretty small and not that visible, but if you go out of your way to find it, you\u2019ll be able to surround yourself with queer friends and spaces. \n\nBut I\u2019ve had a much harder time finding any community with other low-income people. There *is* the Montserrat Coalition, but it\u2019s pretty removed from campus life, so I\u2019ve never really had a reason to make use of it. I grew up being one of the wealthier kids in my town (I lived in a house and wasn\u2019t food insecure) but I\u2019m still significantly poorer than any friend I\u2019ve ever had at BC, so that\u2019s been pretty isolating for me. I also don\u2019t come from a stable family background, so between that and being poor there isn\u2019t a lot about my childhood that I can talk about that other people can relate to. But hopefully in the future BC will be a more diverse space in terms of race, sexuality, and class alike.",

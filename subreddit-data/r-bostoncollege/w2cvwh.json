Been here for a year and anywhere on campus, even though I might have 5 bars of LTE, I cant use the internet on my phone at all unless I'm on the BC wifi. It's like BC is jamming the internet or something. Is it just me? Sometimes it's a massive pain in the \\*\\*\\* when I can't connect to wifi and really need to do something on my phone.",

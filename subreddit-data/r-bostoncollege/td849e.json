No Greek life dosent stop us, you just have to make fun with your friends, and there are always parties goin on and there is so much to do in Boston. That being said, while some majors are harder than others, we are a hard working school and I am always doing homework every second I can. It\u2019s more competition against yourself - I\u2019ve never felt competitive against other students or anything. We are Jesuit and therefore super kind and \u201cpeople for others\u201d. I can\u2019t speak too much about grade inflation , especially because I\u2019m in MCAS not CSOM. Good luck!",

Many comment on the differences due to professors( attempt to ask about each and look at Rate My Professor). Believe it\u2019s rigorous as a T30 ish school would be but acceptance rates are not out of the ordinary(3.9/1500 ave ) for a decent shot. Tour guide loved the school,well run and fwiw there\u2019s been a vast array of food pics on this site from BC students complaining about quality,quantity,and price gouging in their opinion.",

We're a group of hard workers but it's mostly up to you how much effort you want to put into your studies. While homework can pile up around midterms or finals, we almost always have plenty of time to have fun. There's always something to do both on and off campus.",

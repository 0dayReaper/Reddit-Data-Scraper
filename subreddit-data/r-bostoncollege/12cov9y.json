    "postText": "Update on Boston government. I have included a newsletter and the link to get free weekly information about local issues important to life in Boston. I\u2019m working on a project to inform and connect Boston residents and communities with their local government by creating and distributing a weekly newsletter summarizing Boston City Council meetings. My goal is to make important government proceedings accessible so busy people can understand what is going on in their city and how they might be affected by new policies. Previous suggestions have been super helpful so any and all feedback is appreciated!\n\n**Boston City Council Meeting**: 3/29/2023\n\nDuration: 1 hour 42 minutes\n\nAttendance: All present\n\n**Passed Unanimously:**\n\n* $10,000 grant from Recreational Equipment Inc. (REI) for winter toys and accessories. It will contribute to the \u201cPlay Shed\u201d Mayor\u2019s New Urban Mechanics program for improving public spaces. Referred from Committee on City Services and Innovation. Sponsor: Bok ([0612](https://boston.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6073221&amp;GUID=5FB32937-3307-4B2C-8670-FA06ECDF9507)).\n* $4,150 grant for Program Exhibits from the National Arts Program Foundation to fund event costs for the employee art exhibits.

Passage now would result in implementation Spring 2024, delays in approval will cause implementation to take at least two years. A backlog of scheduled hearings means that if a hearing is scheduled it would be unlikely to pass the law before the deadline in July. Sponsor: Arroyo ([0606](https://boston.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6073266&amp;GUID=927E3169-DF6F-4180-91BB-60F51D28C2C2)) **Vote delayed until next meeting.**\n   * Councilor **Flaherty** noted the lack of public hearings and inquired about communication with unions representing builders. \n   * Councilor **Lara** responded by mentioning support from trade unions in exchange for city backing on building code legislation in the statehouse. She also clarified that the law does not require all electric construction but does require infrastructure to allow fully electric modifications.\n   * Councilor **Baker** criticized the new code for requiring wiring for solar in most buildings as inefficient and misguided.\n   * Councilor **Arroyo** mentioned that the requirements only apply to new buildings and research suggests they do not increase costs of construction. He also pushed for a vote.\n   * Councilor **Fernandes Anderson** suggests a hearing.\n   * Councilor **Bok** emphasizes the fact that most discussion of this issue takes place at the state level and that municipalities do not have the authority to adjust it.\n   * Councilor **Murphy** recommended waiting because the process is rushed and she perceives some unions to be excluded from the process.\n   * Councilor **Flynn** also expressed concern about the rushed process. \n\n**Committee on: Arts, Culture, and Special Events**\n\n* $4,601,589 grant from the Boston Planning Development Agency to fund the Government Center Garage/Hub on Causeway Arts and Placemaking Fund.

It was only held once a week (if I remember correctly) and lasted a few hours. While helpful to being introduced to the concepts that the LSAT tests, the structure of the exam, how to approach certain questions, etc I'm not sure it was worth it. \n\n My prep during the summer (both self-study and in-person Kaplan) was much more effective. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk more.",

I took an LSAT course at BC and it didn\u2019t even come close to preparing me mentally to even think about what I was doing (ie taking essentially the SATs over again). You need to remove yourself from school life for even a semester to really appreciate the importance of taking a test like that.",

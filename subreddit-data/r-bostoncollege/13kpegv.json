Homework could be tricky sometimes though. Exams were generally not bad if you studied the proofs of the major theorems, the homework assignments, and general applications of the topics in class. I actually really enjoyed the content of the class as well.\n\nDidn't have Meyerhoff, but took Euclidean &amp; Non-Euclidean Geometry with CK. Some topics were pretty interesting, and CK is a great engaging teacher. Homeworks were usually straightforward but pretty long - I wouldn't recommend just doing it the night before. I found the exams relatively easy compared to the homework; the questions were usually directly formed from what was taught in class so you could do well with just pure memorization.",

I think he mentioned that if he were going to curve he would do it at the end of the semester - so all raw scores would stay on Canvas until the class is over, which can be frustrating as you won't know if you really got curved significantly.\n\nGeometry was better in this regard because CK curved each test based on the average score, which he tells you once he grades them- so what went on Canvas was your curved grade and there were no surprises at the end of the year. But I don't know if Meyerhoff does this. Like I mentioned, the exams were relatively easy compared to other classes so he usually only curved a few points to get the class average to around an 85.\n\nMost math classes at BC have a curve, especially for the more difficult classes like Analysis and Algebra.",

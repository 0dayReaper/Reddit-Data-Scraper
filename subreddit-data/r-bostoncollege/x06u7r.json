I have a lot of friends who were screwed over and they took classes at UMass. My recommendation: find an accredited four year uni and before you pay for classes, get the syllabus approved, follow up mid semester. And don\u2019t delete ANY emails. I didn\u2019t get a Political Science course approved for my major because the department head was changed. So even h though the previous department head approved it, when I submitted the forms the next semester, the new department head rejected the course for not being \u201cpolitical enough.\u201d Ridiculous. And I lost the email chain so I couldn\u2019t properly defend my case.\n\nEdit: don\u2019t think community colleges are accepted btw. BC goes hard for prestige, they don\u2019t believe community courses are equal to the BC classes.",

I asked my academic advisor the same question; asking your advisor to check for you and also looking at websites like Transferology for people who got past courses approved can help.",

    "postText": "So I got into CSOM as a sophomore transfer but also got into a few others like Emory, UNC, and UVA.\n\nCurious to hear how good CSOM recruiting is for IB? Trying to make a decision asap but dont know which to pick, every school has pros/cons but im curious to hear from current CSOM students who went through the recruitment process at BC without being nepo babies or daddy being an MD.\n\nWhat banks recruit on campus? \n\nAs an estimate, how many students place into IB per year?\n\nHow hard is it to connect with alum from BC (are they well connected/willing to help)?",

There were definitely people that didn't get in to IB, but at least from the people I knew, it was a pretty achievable goal.",

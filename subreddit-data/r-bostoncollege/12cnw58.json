It\u2019s a good reputation, depending on the major, it may not matter going to another school much less expensive. To maximize acceptance do a lor( I did 3 total) with any updates on grades, recognition.) doesn\u2019t hurt to explain it\u2019s your first choice etc.gl",

Idk of scholarships,but honestly if you look at BCs aid,it states scholarships or at minimum a percentage of them will be deducted from aid so be aware of that. Again great reputation but maybe look at other options if it\u2019s going to be a burden. You can send the letter of continued interest as an additional info within the application portal generally.",

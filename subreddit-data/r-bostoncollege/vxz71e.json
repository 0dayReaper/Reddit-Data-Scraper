Not a finance concentration so idk about those classes, but unless you\u2019ve already taken financial accounting and fundamentals of finance take those instead. Both minor and major need them as the first two courses. \n\nIf you\u2019re enrolled in CSOM drop Int Spanish. Only nessecary for MCAS and absolutely horrible department.",

    "postText": "I dropped PULSE after the first semester because it was way too much time for my course load, and also I didn't like my placement at all. I took Phil of the Person II this semester and now I fulfilled my core requirement for philosophy on my degree audit. I now signed up for Engaging Catholicism for the summer and its saying on the degree audit that this wouldn't fully fulfill my theology requirement. Is there away around this?",

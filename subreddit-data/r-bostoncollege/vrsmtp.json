Since it was offered for 2025 already, they can\u2019t really get rid of it for that year, but given what happened I think they lost the capacity to really keep offering it on its own in the future. You can still see on the list of concentrations, but this is normally what happens when they decide to end a concentration, for example, there used to be Economics and Computer Science concentrations they they\u2019ve ended in the past.",

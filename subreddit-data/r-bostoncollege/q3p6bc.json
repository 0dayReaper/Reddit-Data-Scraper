But to an extent, I feel isolated.\nI\u2019m surrounded by wealth. \n\nPeople here don\u2019t seem to understand how money works. They think they have their own credit cards because their names are written on the piece of plastic- but they buy whatever they want and the balance gets paid off by their parents every month. Their debit card withdraws money from their parents bank account. I am apprehensive about spending money while everyone else around me spends it carelessly. \n\nAll the money I spend here (on going out to eat, movies, things to do in the city, etc.) is money coming out of MY bank account. It\u2019s money I earned from working and I don\u2019t just want to blow it all. Not a lot of people get that.\nI know there ARE plenty of other people like me here. but a lot of times it just doesn\u2019t feel like the majority &amp; that can be hard.",

Lots of great people are involved there, both students and those that work there, and free stuff is offered all the time so you don\u2019t have to spend your own hard-earned money. I was a part of it and wish I was more involved when I went to BC.\n\nOtherwise, you just have to ignore it. I\u2019m from a wealthy small town where I was towards the bottom, so coming to BC wasn\u2019t a big change for me. Just worry about yourself and find friends who don\u2019t go to bars on weekends to spend $100+ per night. There are plenty of Eagles out there who feel exactly the same as you.",

My advice, it's ok to say \"i'm going to pass on this .. fill in the blank on whatever expensive thing your friends are proposing\". It feels like a big deal in the moment but it is not. If you got in BC you have the intelligence and drive to earn enough money in the future to be able to do the things you want to do. As a black dude who grew up with nothing, coming to campus and having a friend group that was the polar opposite was challenging in this respect, but don't feel pressure to conform to your friends - fuck that be yourself it's ok. Your friends, don't understand the value of money right now - that is ok. Don't get overly frustrated with those differences",

One thing to understand is these kids didn\u2019t choose to be born into wealthy families, (although there is a distinction between flaunting cash and just using it whenever they feel.) You will get used to it or you won\u2019t, I guess. Find your own people and if you don\u2019t like those kinds of people then don\u2019t focus on them. Its easy for me to wish I had that sort of disposable income but I am who I am because I don\u2019t. Good luck. isolation and loneliness will likely subside after you meet your best friends and support groups. Freshman year is challenging.",

Your colleagues are going to get a rude awakening when they are off on their own or even latter on in their college career when the bill is due. It\u2019s very common for students to rack up CC debt even when they or their parents don\u2019t really have the money. \n\nSome of what you are seeing is truly young people who come from wealth, but you would be surprised or even shocked how much of it is irresponsible spending. Don\u2019t get suckered in, be responsible with your money now and it will pay literal dividends down the line.",

Not being wealthy plus having divorced parents definitely made me feel like an outsider in many scenarios at BC. Back then it seemed like a lot of students didn't live in the real world. \n\nI specifically remember reading an article in The Heights one year about tuition increases that included a quote from someone who said \"well it doesn't matter to me, my parents paid for all 4 years upfront when I was a freshman\" because people literally came from families that just had an extra $150K lying around. \n\nI also remember one time being in Lower Dining Hall very shortly after my grandfather died and some girl came in sobbing and told her friend that it was the worst day ever because her hair dryer wasn't working that morning or something equally ridiculous. She actually said it was the worst thing that had ever happened to her. \n\nI will say though that in my current job where I work with children involved with the child welfare system, I have come across 2 parents of these children who had significant substance use disorders, had lost custody of their children and had gone to BC. I was genuinely shocked because it always seemed like everyone at BC had such perfect lives.",

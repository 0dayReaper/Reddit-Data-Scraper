So about 30 weeks for the school year.\n\n$6000 / 30 weeks = You\u2019d need to make ~~$400~~ $200 a week \n\n$200 a week / $16 an hour = ~~25~~ 12.5 hours a week \n\n$16/hour is the pay for a lot of campus jobs. ~~25 hours a week is TOUGH as a student. You might not even find a job that can give you that many hours.~~ Some of them limit to 10 or 20 hours a week. You\u2019d have to find an off-campus job, maybe at a restaurant, that would earn you more money and not have a limit on hours. But it will be hard to manage that with classwork.\n\nHonestly my advice is to take out at least a small loan. It will not be difficult to pay that back once you graduate.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m an idiot and didn\u2019t account for working during the summer, which makes it doable. But if you only mean the actual school year, that\u2019s tough to do.\n\nEdit part 2: fixed the math",

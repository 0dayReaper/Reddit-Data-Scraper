They are difficult, but very doable once you get into the mindset of proofs and more pure math. That\u2019s the purpose of intro to abstract math. These courses build on that foundation. Tbh, I took them later in my math career and it was a big help since I\u2019d developed the mindset of thinking through a proof, understanding mathematical notation, etc\u2026. You won\u2019t have the proper mindset and way of problem solving for them just yet coming from calc and linear.",

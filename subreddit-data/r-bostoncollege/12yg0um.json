Not sure if people who go there have plenty of lunch options already. Will do some rounds of market research, but thought I'd ask here, too. Thanks!",

I\u2019m wondering if you could park a truck right across from the front of St. Ignatius by that little triangle between the church and 2150.",

The trailer itself won't be too big. It will be a solo gig. I much prefer paying for parking instead of worrying about violating some kind of traffic regulations. In search of metered parking space... :) But if your suggestion works just fine, without BC and the town having any issues, I will definitely work in front of St. Ignatius.",

    "postText": "This building sucks ass. I have failed every class I\u2019ve ever taken in it. The chocolate bar is expensive and the lines are long and all the tables are filled with girls flexing their large iced coffees and colored pens. Like fuck off, honestly. Why do you even need different colored pens. Also why is it so damn big. They could be housing all of us newton freshman on campus but instead they built this monstrosity of a building to host entry level theology and lit core classes.",

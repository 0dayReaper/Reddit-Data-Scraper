    "postText": "Recently someone on my hall(outside of my 8 man) tested positive, and we only found out through word of mouth. If a student tests positive then not only should everyone in their class and roommates be informed, but those on the hall as well. We were obviously in close proximity for the entire time we have been here especially on elevators, hallways, and lounges. Everyone in my 8 man is staying in until we all test negative.",

While HIPAA does impose strong restrictions, and does limit the sharing of medical info with unauthorized individuals, HIPAA doesn't actually cover every possible \"speaker\" of data. HIPAA only restricts \"covered entities.\" From the HHS website:\n\n\"The HIPAA Rules apply to\u00a0**covered entities and business associates**. \u00a0\n\nIndividuals, organizations, and agencies that meet the definition of a\u00a0**covered entity**\u00a0under HIPAA\u00a0must comply with the Rules' requirements to protect the privacy and security of health information and must provide individuals with certain rights with respect to their health information. ...  If an entity does not meet the definition of a covered entity or business associate, it does not have to comply with the HIPAA Rules.\" (emphasis original).\n\n\"Covered entities\" are described as organizations conducting business that falls under (at least) one of: \" (1) **health plans**, (2) **health care clearinghouses**, and (3) **health care providers** who electronically transmit any health information in connection with transactions for which HHS has adopted standards.\" Quoting from [an IHE article](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/08/31/colleges-want-professors-stay-mum-student-covid-19-cases) on the matter:\n\n&gt; Michael\u00a0F. Arrigo, an expert witness in various HIPAA-related court cases, said that educational institutions are not generally considered HIPAA-covered entities, as such entities are health plans, health care clearinghouses and health care providers who electronically transmit health data. ...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Brett\u00a0Sokolow, chair of the campus risk management firm\u00a0TNG\u00a0Consulting, also agreed that HIPAA isn\u2019t relevant to COVID-19\u00a0student-related\u00a0notifications. \n\nThe law that likely applies to COVID-related disclosures is FERPA, which handles student data. And while that generally prohibits sharing educational records and private data (that can include diagnoses, etc.), it does allow sharing of information that serves a \"legitimate educational interest\" (where wide deference is given to the institution to define). And while they couldn't tell someone the identity of who tested positive, the university isn't restricted in how many people they can define a \"close contact\" and inform of a recent exposure incident.\n\nThe fact that the school *does* tell certain individuals that there has been a close contact suggests there isn't much (if any) additional legal exposure by broadening that definition to tell more students. While schools like saying their hands are tied, as long as they establish a clear policy that doesn't expose unnecessary personal information (i.e. only tells contacts they've been exposed, not who tested positive), universities have wide latitude in defining who should be notified.",

I promise you you\u2019re not going to get corona from being in an elevator with someone for less than 2 minutes if everyone is wearing masks. You wouldn\u2019t get contact traced from being in an elevator with someone. If it was as easy to get corona from being in an elevator with someone as you think it is, they would consider that close contact and would contact trace you.",

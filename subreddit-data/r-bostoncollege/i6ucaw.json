Biweekly testing for all students. 18k+ tests/week \n\nBU: Test upon arrival. 5000 tests/day and biweekly testing for all students  \n\nI don\u2019t see BC\u2019s plan being nearly effective enough to track outbreaks. Although there are rules to limit gatherings BC says that guest policies will be based on self policing. Any thoughts?",

These other schools cannot possibly process tens of thousands of tests on a weekly basis and expect people to get results quickly. The testing capacity just isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s at best aspirational and at worst extremely cynical to publish these grand plans that have no hope of materializing. Of course, it\u2019ll all be moot when 25% of the student body is infected by Columbus Day, a student ends up in the ICU and everyone gets sent home",

BC will also have a small in-house testing capacity, though most of its tests will be processed by the Broad Institute with a 6-26 hour turnaround time. None of these universities will be greatly affected by the nationwide test shortage/slowdown, thankfully.",

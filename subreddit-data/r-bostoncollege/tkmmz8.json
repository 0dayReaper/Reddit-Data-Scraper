Seriously, have it written down and make sure everyone agrees on it. You should know what you\u2019re going to do on 6 and 9 day if necessary (I recommend skipping it because either you drop 2 friends or have to find a random person). And you should know how you\u2019re going to split into doubles/triples on the last day. Housing can ruin friendships. Take some small steps to prevent that!",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I just got accepted RD to the COAS and I have a couple questions about the student life at BC. \n1. What does your typical week look like as a BC student?\n2. What is the social scene like (parties, off campus stuff, clubs etc)? \n3. What made you pick BC and are you happy that you did? \nAny insight about your experience would be extremely helpful! I\u2019m deciding between BC and a couple other schools and want to hear some opinions and thoughts that I wouldn\u2019t be able to find on their website. Thank you!",

            "comment": "quick note: most people say mcas for the college of arts and sciences! \n\n1) typical week: mon-fri is centered around my class times, usually work 2 shifts at work too. wake up, go to class, lunch w/ friends, more class sometimes. go to work or library. go home (I\u2019m on newton, research that if you haven\u2019t, it\u2019s chill though). chill for a while or do homework depending on how busy I am. then I either eat dinner on Newton and go back to my dorm or head to club meetings or class discussion\u2014this part is pretty universal for most college kids I feel like. I go out occasionally on weekends but I\u2019m not a huge partier, although I usually have something planned with friends (going into the city, some BC event, etc etc) at least one of the days. During football/hockey seasons a lot of people go to games on the weekends. \n\n2) tbh, BC\u2019s social scene REALLY depends on the person and your connections. Freshmen will have little dorm parties, sometimes will go to sophomore dorm parties if they know someone. There\u2019s a few bars and restaurants that are lax with fakes but Boston definitely isn\u2019t like tiny college towns that rely on underage people to make money. Clubs are pretty huge on campus. Because BC doesn\u2019t have greek life, clubs will host parties and social stuff and are a really good way to make friends (especially the smaller, more niche interest ones). Also, there\u2019s always something to do here (it just might not be a party lol). Perk of going to school in/near a big city is that you have the entire city at your fingertips and can always find something interesting.\n\n3) I\u2019m gonna be blunt here. BC was the best school I got into and had the location I wanted, so I went. This school is full of rich white people from the Northeast and it SHOWS. It was a massive culture shock for me. I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re from or how you grew up, but it\u2019s worth mentioning. Thankfully I\u2019ve found people that I genuinely enjoy and can relate to and a club that I love being a part of, but it was really hard the first semester. Finding your niche is super important. BC is a school you can\u2019t be passive at, you have to actively seek out people and experiences you want.",

            "comment": "1.) You are as busy as you make yourself. Get involved and you could have a packed schedule of club meetings, stay out of the club scene and you'll have a lot of free time.\n\n2.) Social scene for freshmen is mixed, sophomores is 8-man parties and clubs (you need a fake), juniors is off campus house parties, seniors is bars. No frats so don't expect a crazy social scene here, clubs also serve as little social groups to go out with, so you can always find little communities. \n\n3.) I love BC because it truly embodies its vision to be \"men and women for others\". Its not just a cute selling point. All of my professors have not only been incredible teachers but incredible people who really want me to make a difference in the world. I think the people that dislike this school the most are the ones that lied on their supplement applications on how they saw themselves making a difference in the world. I could not recommend enough!",

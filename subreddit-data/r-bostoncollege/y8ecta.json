BC has a higher med school acceptance rate but a lower accepted gpa than the national average. This speaks to how hard bc premed courses are compared to other schools, but it pays off. Also BC has great pre health resources and is near Boston which has amazing healthcare opportunities.",

Unless you are innately good at memorizing book materials and/or had a strong high school science teacher and curriculum.  Some pursue non-science majors and take post-undergrad pre-med classes.  I'd suggest going that route, but it takes money, time, hard work, and patience.  Transferring to a school with an affiliated med school would make more sense to me.  Eastern Ohio University (?) had an interesting article about a middle aged mechanic becoming a doctor.  A program like that would be much better imho.",

Only issue is that volunteering through more connected channels can be difficult as these clubs are weirdly competitive in who they allow to join. Shadowing is more dependent on surrounding hospitals and that's not that great either. Connecting with profs is very hit or miss and depending on your class year you might be competiting for attention with their children or their friend's children. Research in the biology department is pretty bad. Low amount of spaces and quite frankly most of it isn't that impactful or even related to clinical research.\n\nLastly, premed advising is awful. The advisors range from being tangentially aware of medical school admissions to utter ignorance. A lot of what they've said about certain schools or just general process stuff be flat out wrong.",

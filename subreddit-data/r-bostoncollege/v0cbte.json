I mean as far as how many core curriculum classes vs how many electives - I know that overall all graduates need 120 hours.\n\nMCAS spells out their requirements pretty clearly (\"Included in the program are at least 45 credits in the Core Curriculum, usually 30 to 36 credits in a major department, and elective courses in other departments. You also are expected to demonstrate proficiency at the intermediate level in a modern foreign language or in a classical language. Ninety-six of the total 120 credits must be from departments in the College of Arts and Sciences.\") but CSOM does not.\n\ndoes that \"45 credits in the Core Curriculum\" apply to all BC students or just MCAS?\n\nThanks!",

There\u2019s the CSOM core on top of that, however because of how CSOM is structured between the core and your concentration you take about the same amount of classes as you would for a B.S. from any of the other schools. Otherwise, there\u2019s the same number of credits required overall to graduate so you shouldn\u2019t have more to do in either regardless.\n\nAside from that, another piece of advice is it\u2019s easier to transfer into MCAS or pick up a double major in it than it is to switch into CSOM once you\u2019re there. It\u2019s really easy to add an Arts &amp; Sciences major or minor to CSOM but near impossible to switch in if you\u2019re accepted for MCAS.",

So if you think you might ultimately want to enroll in CSOM, it might be best to go with that from the start and see if you want to change your mind later.",

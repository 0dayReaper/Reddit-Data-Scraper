            "comment": "At my commencement, men wore suits (normal colors like navy/black/grey) and women wore formal dresses. For students, most guys just wore a suit without the jacket (due to the gown) and most girls wore white dresses. If you google image college commencement it is pretty representative of what people wear.\n\nI would just go as formal as you can due to it being commencement.",

My commencement was very sunny (so with a black gown on top of my clothes, it was HOT), then two years later it poured rain on my sister's (and the ceremony is outdoors at Alumni rain or shine -- they only put the severe weather plan in place if there's lightning, etc.). I'd go for a spring semi-formal, a nice sundress for women and shirt/tie/smart slacks for men. But bottom line, keep the weather in mind because it's a long day!",

Comfortable shoes/ones you can easily walk in! \n\nBobby pins for your cap to keep it on your head. \n\nMy guy friends wore suit pants or khakis and a button-down with a tie. \n\nMy family wore sundresses, blouses, nice polos, khakis\u2026Commencement 2018 was so frickin hot and sunny so please make sure your family is prepared (water, sunscreen, hat)",

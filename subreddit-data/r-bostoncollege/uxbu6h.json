If you have space, you\u2019ll probably want to try taking computer systems in addition one semester, and computer Org the other.\n\nNote: I wrote this aiming you\u2019re on one of the CS major tracks; if you\u2019re just doing a minor, then you should check the BC website to see what they recommend for any given area you may want to focus on, since it had fewer requirements and you may be able to take easier/more relevant courses for your interests",

    "postText": "As somebody who was a dancer for over 10 years and thoroughly enjoyed dancing and all of the performances, I can\u2019t help but think BCDE shouldn\u2019t have won.\n\nWhile they\u2019re an extremely talented group, their costumes, lighting, and routine was a lot similar to DOBC\u2019s (not saying they did it on purpose, but it shows a lack of creativity). Also there were many times that they were not together in terms of counting, arms, turns, landing etc. They\u2019re a very large group, but other large groups such as Synergy and Aerodynamik were still able to stay almost perfectly together with each other.\n\nNot only that, but the theme was culture, and they sort of failed to show that in their routine. I know their theme was to show their culture of sisterhood and feminism, but it kind of fell through.\n\nAnd finally, my last critique, was that while other groups had greatly impactful charities that pertained to very relevant topics in the 21st century, they decided to give their money to Boston College\u2019s campus which feels absolutely redundant and gives the impression that the winner was rigged.\n\nAlmost everyone I talked to has agreed, and when they announced the winner the entire section I was sitting next to didn\u2019t clap or cheer, they just got up and left.\n\nPlease let me know your opinions!",

BCDE donated to the [Campus School](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/lynch-school/sites/campus-school.html), which is a school for children with extensive support (health/learning) needs. It is publicly funded and the money goes to the Campus School, not to BC. The Campus School is a really special part of BC\u2019s culture and and you will notice many fundraisers from various groups are for the Campus School, and that a lot of students volunteer there. \n\nI suggest you rethink your opinion that BCDE donating to this charity implies that the winner was rigged.",

Whatever your opinion, they worked super hard, considering that they also had their own show this weekend. It is what it is. I think it\u2019s horrible that they are getting so much slander.",

Saying that BCDE was worse across cohesiveness, theme, culture, originality, etc. is not libel, it\u2019s discourse.  And yeah they had another show, but also consider that they quite literally were told by ALC to change their set for being too similar to DO and then they added the Charlie\u2019s bit after to lash out at Golden Eagles too.  A dance organization with that type of scandal should not have even been eligible for winning, \u00e0 la Bring It On (2000).",

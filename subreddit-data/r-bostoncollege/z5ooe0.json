    "postText": "Hi BC Redditors! My impossible-to-surprise father and alum commented during tonight\u2019s game against USC that he likes Jeff Hafley\u2019s \u201cFor Boston\u201d hoodie. It\u2019s a gray hoodie, embroidered in maroon and gold; made by Adidas. The bookstore sells the same kind of embroidery, but not with that phrase. I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere online. I\u2019d love to order him one. Does anyone know if it\u2019s available for purchase? I know a lot of coach gear is exclusive to the team. Thanks in advance.",

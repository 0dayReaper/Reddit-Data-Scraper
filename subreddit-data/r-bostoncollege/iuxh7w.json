    "postText": "I do not understand why we have UGBC. I get having student representation but what does UGBC actually do besides plan events no one goes to? Also doesn't CAB do the same thing and do it better? Furthermore, I remember last year the current presidential pair won the election by only receiving 8% of the total vote (I know they won a larger percentage of the vote and I am sure they are great guys but the 8% is a representation of the total student populace).  I see all these people running for seats on UGBC with very vague platforms that arent really bringing anything pragmatic to the table. I get the feeling it is just a figurehead position that is a resume builder but why do we not either demand more of the people supposed to be representing us or, my preference, just bring the entire thing down?",

            "comment": "A little late, but I'll defend UGBC. I was involved in UGBC for my 4 years, so my perspective is obviously going to be a little bit pro-UGBC, but I'll be the first to admit its not a perfect club. \n\n**What Does UGBC Do?**\n\n*Things you see*\n\nUGBC has done a lot for a lot of students like getting printers and Lower and Eagles, getting water fountains in dorms, etc.. There are many examples of small things like this that people don't attribute to UGBC. In terms of events, UGBC events are inherently different from CAB events.  While CAB largely hosts \"fun\" activities like Modstock/Skiiing/Apple picking (CAB), UGBC hosts more advocacy-focused events. SI (student initiatives), the division of UGBC which hosts the \"events no one goes to\" that you mentioned is focused on things like mental health (slam the stigma), body positivity (love your body week), or rape education (Care week). These events are obviously of a very different nature and serve a different purpose than CAB events and as a result don't pull in as many people. But I would argue that these events serve a very important purpose. I'll also note that CAB used to be part of UGBC but split off because UGBC has grown into a more advoacy-focused organization.\n\n*Things you don't see*\n\nThe majority of UGBC's impact is longitudinal and focused on improving campus in the long-term. UGBC has a close, although not necessarily powerful, relationship with the administration. The President and Vice President of UGBC meet with the VPSA and Tom Mogan weekly, and also meet regularly with the Board of Trustees and have occasional access to Father Leahy's ear. While it is true that these people don't always listen to what UGBC says, I do think that UGBC has often informed them about what the student body wants and moved the adminitration to be more progressive and in-tune with student interests. The administration adding sexuality to its non-discrimination clause was aided by past UGBC members. If a Student Center is eventually built where the Old Plex used to be, it is in no small part because of UGBC. Efforts to increase diversity in professor hiring, diversity in who the school admits, and being more environmentally sustainable are all things that I would say the school has improved upon in the past 10 years, in part because of UGBC pressure. Organizations like BC ITS, which now provides the xfinity streaming services, BC Dining, and a whole other bunch of other BC institutions rely on input from UGBC members to shape their decisions. \n\nAnd finally, UGBC does A LOT for the LGBTQ+ community and a fair amount for the AHANA+ community as well. Because the university refuses to allow any explicitly \"homosexuality-promoting\" club on campus, UGBC's GLC provides the only community-building, event-planning, and safe space for many queer students on campus. These efforts obviously go unappreciated if you're not part of the AHANA+ or LGBTQ+ communities. \n\n\n**Finances**\n\nNow let's talk about finances and the perception that UGBC wastes a lot of money. The UGBC budget is usually about $310,000 (exluding paying the UGBC advisors). That translates to about ~$33 per student out of the $330 student activity fund, which is indeed a lot of money. But let's break it down.\n\nUGBC funds the ALC Boat Cruise, GLC Formal, ALC Ball, and ALC Showdown. These events are vital and well-celebrated events for many members of the communities that they serve. Combined, these events cost UGBC $140,000. SI, which hosts numerous events that I mentioned in the 2nd paragraph, gets $60,000 to fund their events. The ALC (the AHANA+ Leadership Conference), GLC (GLBTQ+ Leadership Confernce), CSD (Council for Students with Disabilities), get $30,000, $30,000, and $11,000 respectively to fund socials, speaker events, campaigns, retreats, and merchandise, which actually far less than most culture clubs. The Senate, which admittedly gets a lot of publicity for little actual action, only gets $5000, most of which funds the Thanksgiving Buses to Logan Airport. The Communicaations Department, which is responsible for making all the UGBC fliers and designs the UGBC sweatshirts that you see, receives $15,000. Finally, like a fair number of other clubs and in-line with the BC culture of retreats, UGBC gets their own retreat before the school year that costs about $20,000. So, it's hard for me to say that any of these things aren't vital. Merchandise and the retreat could probably be hemmed, but many clubs on campus get their own merchanise and retreat. \n\nNow the Executive Board of UGBC does receive a stipend of about $20,000 in total (President gets $4000, Exec VP gets $3500, all other VPs get $2000). Admittedly, it is a strong argument that basically no other club executive board get paid. But I think it is especially important that people from low-income background or rely on work-study have the opportunity to become involved in UGBC leadership, and might literally be unable to afford this expensive-ass school without the stipend. That being said, this year's president and VP declined the stipend for better or worse. \n\nSo that was a wall of text, but I hope it informs others a little bit about what UGBC does. Happy to answer any questions that anyone has about what I wrote.",

The handicap accessible walkway to upper that\u2019s being added to the election ballot? That\u2019s taken more than a year for BC to listen, and they only listened when UGBC offered to fund the construction. All senators do is say we need to be more transparent and then pass little fake resolutions all year and be vague",

Putting pressure on students isn't the worst idea imo, especially when you consider that the biggest uptick in cases last week was due to large off-campus gatherings; I don't see how an increase in testing would have prevented those kids from gathering. Of course, it would have been beneficial to test the entire school as soon as the school noticed so many kids were coming up positive, I'll concede that point. \n\nAs I mentioned above, UGBC is a face for BC, meaning most likely they'll align with administrative interests (unless they're campaigning, when they'll conveniently say all these terrible things about the school that need to be fixed). They're all in that group to pretend they're doing better things for the student body, but in actuality they're just building their resumes. Does their campaign shirk responsibility for the administration to do more testing per week? Hell yea, I want more testing at this school and it shouldn't fall squarely on my shoulders. Are they wrong for making a video warning kids about doing stupid shit? No.",

And UGBC is not one of those entitites. For the last month, all they've done is drive home and reinforce the school's message that reopening depends on student behavior. If that's all they want to do, quit student government and go be an intern for Jack Dunn. This premise is totall false if you read anything experts and epidemiologists have published, and it serves, quite purposefully on the school's part, to shift blame and attention away from the schools glaring failures. 1/5 of all positive tests at colleges in the entire state of MA are at BC, the state took over their contract tracing. You think BC students'behavior is much different than BU or Northeastern or anywhere else? Of course not, but they have better programs in place. It's an embarressment. The contract tracing app they talked about in the summer wasn't ready, they said they'd be doing their own testing in a lab on campus, it's not ready yet. It's not just a few small mistakes it's inexcusable failures. Go find me all the UGBC posts or public statments demanding more testing? Have they publicly challanged the administrationon anything? Did they do anything to fight for the distribution of all the cares act money and not just half? They even refused to condemn BC sending cops to Dorchester this summer. Has the current administration even once challanged the school on anything on behlaf of students? The fact you expect them to align with the administration's interests is telling. This is an excellent article, register to read it for free, where multiple experts clearly stated a plan like BC's was inadequate and going to lead to the virus spreading.",

If that was true in any way, we would have rehauled our reopening plan back in June, when students and parents were first sending in their concerns to the school.  It's only when we're seriously confronted by state or federal administration that we would do anything different.\n\nBC has historically been deaf to their students about social change. This issue is the exact same. Students love to run the gauntlet about UGBC doing nothing (which is definitely true nonetheless) and that somehow the collective student body will revolt, but our administration is not getting shit done. Our petitions were signed for increased testing, right? We've sent in letters and emails to the school? We've been published *multiple* times in the local newspapers about how \"shitty\" things are going? Tell me what has been different about BC since all of those instances have occurred.\n\nI've said to this account a number of times: I completely understand where you're coming from, and I agree with your sentiments, but nothing has changed.",

You should include in the description of your ticket the serial number on the port so they can have one of the IT guys come to the maintenance room of your building and switch on your port.\n\nEdit: Usually BC wants you to try to use WiFi, but if you just say in the ticket that it\u2019s unusable then you should be fine.",

    "postText": "I think we can all agree that UGBC is a bloated and generally pointless institution at this school. UGBC's 500k+ annual budget and their non-binding resolutions (ie the school does not have to act on ANY legislation they pass) make the organization as a whole essentially a live action role play for kids who are a little too into The West Wing and House of Cards. I have no issue with people playing make believe and wasting their college time talking about an LGBTQ+ resource center that the school will never let happen but I do have a problem paying for it. For those who are not aware, part of undergraduate tuition goes to UGBC. Therefore I don't think that any of these former High School Debate kids should have the resume boost that the Presidency would give them and is ultimately the only real thing UGBC does. Therefore I vote we write-in \"Doug Flutie Statue\" as UGBC President because an inanimate bronze statue will do about as much as any self obsessed person we could elect.",

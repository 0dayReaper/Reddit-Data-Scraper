Require a test before arrival 4. Put desks 6 feet apart (they say 3-6 feet) 5. Allow all classes to be taken online 6. Provide isolation housing for off campus students. They are only testing reporting numbers 3 days a week now and didn\u2019t make an announcement just a stealth change to the BC covid testing page. We had to hear about the swim team from the Globe? No information of what BC is going to do now that there is an actual outbreak? Do we actually have a communications major at BC? Could administration speak to that faculty? What is actually happening?",

It\u2019s too late to change students actions that have already *happened* \\- they need to up the number of \u201csurveillance\u201d testing and idk maybe *completely redo their testing plan to make if feasible!*\n\nAlso, they say the check app needs to be completed everyday but then the only ones checking (for real) is the library and the gym. I\u2019ve never been checked at the dining hall (to be fair I don\u2019t go there often). Why isn\u2019t it required for in person classes?? Also, most students I know don\u2019t read their emails that often, so once again they don\u2019t understand how clear communication works.",

Have we not seen numerous reports of large party gatherings many nights, especially on weekends?\n\nBringing everyone back was a big risk in the first place. This spike was going to happen no matter what because students will party anyway, and you\u2019re crowding thousands of people in the same areas constantly over weeks and weeks, whether it\u2019s the classroom, dorms/common rooms, dining halls, etc.\n\nAt the bare minimum, they\u2018re gonna have to test everyone at least once a week to prevent these outbreaks, or it\u2019s over (if it isn\u2019t already).\n\nEdit: grammar",

This is because those schools are able to isolate positive people before they spread it all over because they test everyone twice a week.",

So, your roommate could break the rules without you knowing and come back and share your bathroom and bedroom and pass it to you. Or it could be someone who was is the shower right before you and sneezed or coughed or had a large exhale. Unless you wear a mask in the shower, you would likely contract it and it would not be your fault. What did all of the nursing home residents do to contract it? What rules did they break?",

Depending on their behavior, yes, they can increase their chances of picking up the virus. However, a large part of the responsibility is on everyone else to sanitize, wear masks, and social distance. So the student body as a whole has a great responsibility to help others stay safe as well as helping themselves.",

            "comment": "If you're looking to be placed on the main campus I would stay away from anything in the reservoir apartments (AKA 2k), as those are located down the road from the main campus. Some people like it as a compromise between being on and off campus, but you'll have to either take a short bus ride to main campus or walk for a little. Additionally, the College Road (AKA CoRo) dorms are located separately from the other Sophomore/Junior/Senior dorms on lower campus, so I wouldn't pick that as a preference. \n\nAside from all that, the rest of the dorms are on lower campus, which accounts for nearly all of the on-campus dorm options for Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors. Sophomores tend to mostly live in suites, with 8-mans being the most popular &amp; available option. On-campus juniors and seniors tend to go for apartments, with most preferring 6-mans to 4-mans in my experience. The main advantage suites and apartments have over traditional dorms are that there's a common space for your dorm (4-man suites have very small ones, the rest are much better), as well as one or two private bathrooms, depending on room type and building. Apartments also include kitchens, while 8- and 6- man suites have kitchenettes.",

            "comment": "I would go for an apartment on lower, unless you\u2019re not going to be 21 yet. If you won\u2019t be 21, and want to be with other non-21 year olds (because then everyone goes out to bars without you), I would stick to housing that is traditionally for sophomores (19 or 20 years old) or juniors (20, turning 21). Typical sophomore housing would be 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 on your list. Juniors are in 1, 2, 3, 4 (rarely), 6, and 7. Seniors will be in 3 &amp; 5.",

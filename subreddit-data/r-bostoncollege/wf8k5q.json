I want to get ahead of the add/drop chaos and ask if they could override the attendance cap or add me to a course waitlist. But I haven\u2019t had a lot of luck. \n\nAny tips for what to say/write in an email?",

You can\u2019t really say much else. You can express how much you want to take the class but even if the prof would love to override every student who asks, there may be a max.",

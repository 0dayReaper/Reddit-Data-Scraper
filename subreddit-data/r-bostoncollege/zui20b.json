            "comment": "Analysis I/Algebra I are significantly harder from my understanding. I was originally in Analysis I for a week and I realized it was just not worth the effort I would\u2019ve had to put into it. Unless you want to go to graduate school for pure math, I would just do the single-semester versions of both. The only other real pull of the two semester versions is that you can get the \u201cBS\u201d instead of the \u201cBA\u201d, which, as an alum, has not mattered at all for grad school apps or internship searching (for reference I am currently doing an Applied Math masters degree and have secured an internship in data science and the BA vs. BS has not come up once). \n\nTLDR: Only take Analysis I/Algebra I if you are genuinely interested in the topics, otherwise do the single-semester versions.\n\nEdit: Also, if you\u2019re up to the challenge you can take them as well. I\u2019m sure it would be rewarding, just anecdotally, most of my friends I\u2019ve talked to who had taken them and saw them to the end hated the experience. You\u2019re probably busy as it is and life is too short to stress about an unnecessarily challenging class that will, more than likely, yield no real benefit to your career.\n\nEdit (again): Sorry for the long post, just realized I didn\u2019t answer your first question. I found that the intro analysis/algebra were not bad at all. Intro analysis was definitely a little harder than intro algebra, but definitely not the hardest math classes I\u2019ve taken. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve taken probability yet, but I personally found that probability was harder than both of these courses.",

Personally, I thought Probability was harder than both. I still wouldn\u2019t recommend taking them both in the same semester, though.",

            "comment": "Hi, I graduated with a BA in Math and took Analysis I and II and Abstract I and II. I can only speak for myself, but I found all four courses very difficult. I wish going into being a math major I knew how much is was geared towards those wanting to pursue further education in Math. At the time I didn\u2019t really know what I wanted to do after college but was always good at math and liked math during high school and in my first year at BC, but soon discovered that the more abstract non practical math wasn\u2019t for me. I realized it too late into my time though and had to stick with it but at the expense of my grades. I now have a career in finance and I\u2019m sure being a math major helped in a way since it\u2019s a little more unique than those who majored in economics or finance, but I don\u2019t use any math at all that I learned at BC. If I could do it again, I would have majored in something else. \n\nI guess it really depends on what you want to do after college. If you plan on getting a masters/phd or doing any research then I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine in them, but if you\u2019re not in love with math purely for the sake of math and aren\u2019t thinking of doing anything related to math afterwards, then I\u2019d say think about it a bit more and see if there are other courses you can take if they are not required.",

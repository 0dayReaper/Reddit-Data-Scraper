Most students will do it, but you won\u2019t be judged if you don\u2019t. Plenty of opportunities to do so at campus parties or at bars\n\n3. Yes. I hear a lot of top schools can be cutthroat when it comes to academics, but BC kids generally try to help each other out and are kind to one another\n\n4. Not forcing myself to make more friends as a freshman. I\u2019m naturally an introvert, so I wish I had put myself out there more freshman year. It\u2019s a lot easier to find a core group of friends freshman/sophomore year\n\n5. I never did but I would hear of it occasionally. Not super common to my knowledge\n\n6. What?\n\n7. Not really, though frat culture didn\u2019t appeal to me much anyway\n\n8. Yeah I\u2019d say that\u2019s generally true but everyone is different \n\n9. It\u2019s a mixed bag. There are a lot of on campus parties, moreso than a typical Boston school, but friends and I would go out to bars plenty too",

She asked three of her female friends and about ten of us guys.  Mahogany walls, crazy nice room.   I suspect her boyfriend wanted only female friends to tag along based on his astonished look upon our arrival. \n\nI had a bu friend that invited me and my bc friends to his off campus parties.\n\nBoston is an awesome college town.  Particularly if you know people at other local schools.  Like anywhere,  it is what you make of it.\n\nBiggest regret was my cutthroat major (biology) as my high school and my classmate/hometown friend's public high school science classes ill-prepared us.\n\nNot having frats was perfect for me.",

Be prepared to work diligently if you're in a competitive major.  Unless you have a strong AP science background, top ranked schools will be very competitive and possibly difficult.\n\nLiving off campus junior year is also a challenge,  but is a great learning experience in itself.\n\nHometown friends went to local Boston colleges/universities.  If not my own,  then other bc classmates.  I randomly bumped into my high school friend's bu roommate in the bc mods.  The roommate was playing a \"mod\" gig with his band at a football tailgate.  Crazy fun.",

            "comment": "1. Possible, but on the hookup-dating spectrum, BC definitely falls more on the hookup side.\n2. Very prevalent, though there are communities that don't drink like HLC and such.\n3. Very strong sense of community, BC network is strong both during undergrad and after.\n4. Get involved, don't wait too long to do things.\n5. People definitely do this, but honestly probably less than you would think. the BC bubble is real.\n6. It's exclusive in the sense that a lot of BC kids come from well-off families, but I didn't notice much blatant discrimination. There's the occasional (once a semester-ish) issue concerning racism that the school will feel the need to send a message about, but that's probably on par with other universities.\n7. Nah. If you want to party every weekend, there's usually something going on. We have party dorms (Gonzaga, Walsh,) and the mods, so the lack of formal fraternities doesn't mean much.\n8. There's all sorts of people. There are those who seemingly make friends wherever they go and hang out with different people all the time, and there are definitely circles that stick together everywhere. I'm not sure what you mean by \"their own,\" but the answer is probably that there are people that do that and there are others that branch out.\n9. A lot of people do. Obviously you don't have to, but like I said before, the BC bubble is real. Campus is pretty much perfectly located so that you have a nice comfy campus to yourself, but the city is also right there whenever you want to go in.",

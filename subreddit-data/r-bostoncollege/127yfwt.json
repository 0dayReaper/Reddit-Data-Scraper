    "postText": "I have to take one of the required Finance electives in the fall and am thinking about Data Analytics with Reuter. If you've taken the class what did you think of it and how is Reuter? How much work would you say is required in an average week?  \n\nThe only other electives I'm considering are: \n\nCorporate Financial Strategies with Edith Hotchkiss,  \n\nFixed Income Analysis with Paul Ciampa and FinTech\n\nCryptocurrencies with  Gang Nathan Dong\n\nIf you have taken any of these it would be great to hear about them. \n\nThanks!",

Workload was manageable, I went in with zero python experience and I will say I had to work pretty hard to pick it up in the timeframe of the class, but he was really helpful and I learned a lot. Not a particularly tough grader, he\u2019s pretty fair. And super nice guy.",

(weekly homework? cases? exams? programs?). I think I'm okay getting up to speed with Python but haven't done much stats/regression analysis in a while and wonder how much writing/interpretation he expects. I can send a chat request to take this offline if you have the time or if you happen to have the syllabus. Thanks!",

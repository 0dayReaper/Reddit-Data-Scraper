I\u2019m considering Notre Dame and Wake Forest as my other top choices so comparisons for Business and Social Life between the 3 would be extremely helpful. Thx!",

We went out to bars sometimes but they were close to campus (and some of these were only after we turned 21; some bars do Not Mess Around). Never once went to a night club though! \n\nYou will have PLENTY to do on campus or off campus living near such a big city!",

If you want the best education and want to stay in the south post-grad, go to Wake Forest.  You really can\u2019t go wrong with any of them tbh, it\u2019s solely based on what you prefer.  Dorm/house parties do take priority until 21+ here tho.",

After graduation and still boston based, I had a nyc client, and I would inadvertently bump into bc friends all the time without trying while in nyc.\n\nBoston is an iconic American city.  So is Chicago, which is relatively close to ND.  My ND friend didn't go during her four years,  which is lame and maybe the exception.  \nBoston is also a great college town.  Particularly if you have friends at different schools.  I went to a number of my non-bc friends' parties, and they came to bc parties, too.   Based on the city alone,  Boston is the easy answer.   South Bend is an absolute joke in comparison.   It's definitely a beautiful campus, though. \n\nI have no idea about wake forest, but I watched a weekend series about it, and Boston seems a lot more intriguing.",

Mods are rarely hosting parties, most parties are club based, and just about everyone ubers to bars where you pay for covers and overpriced drinks. Under 21 students need to be in clubs, have a really good fake id, or enjoy spending your time drinking Rubinoff in a cramped double",

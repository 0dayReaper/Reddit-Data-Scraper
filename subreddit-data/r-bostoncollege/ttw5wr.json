            "comment": "I knew a few friends who got off the waitlist. One was because her dad donated a lot of money (she was not shy about this). \n\nFor the 2019-20 admittance year, BC offered a waitlist spot to 6,438 students. 3,451 accepted the waitlist spot (53%). Then 159 got in off the waitlist (4.6%). At least it\u2019s more common then getting off the waitlist at schools like Princeton (1 person) or Holy Cross (12). [Source](https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/waitlist-statistics/)\n\nIf you get off the waitlist, and want housing on Upper, you\u2019ll probably be force-tripled. You will also definitely only be given 3 years of housing.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to make you feel discouraged :( but I think you should find a back-up option that makes you happy and feel at home!",

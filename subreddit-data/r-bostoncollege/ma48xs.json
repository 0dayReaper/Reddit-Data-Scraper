    "postText": "These past two weeks have been killer in terms of midterms, group projects, and individual assignments. I still have a few more left to complete but I am just so mentally exhausted. Every weekend basically all I\u2019ve been doing is work and studying. Weekends don\u2019t even feel like weekends anymore because there\u2019s so much work being assigned. It\u2019s going to get easier after this week but I\u2019m finding it so hard to complete the assignments I have left. I just wish we had a break that was actually a break. Not just a day of \u201cno school\u201d that\u2019s replaced by you doing a bunch of homework anyway, but a day where there\u2019s really no focus on school.",

I know that I'm much more flexible in with extensions this semester--if an extra day would help your mental health, it's fine to ask for one.  Not all professors will say yes, but you probably have a sense of who is flexible and who isn't.",

I don't know if they qualify as graphic design, but they essentially teach you how to use Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. The professor of those two courses is super cool and could probably give you some guidance regarding other classes to take if you're interested in graphic design.",

Professor Weisberg was teaching at the time and I liked her. She's very enthusiastic :) Who is teaching the other two courses that you mentioned?",

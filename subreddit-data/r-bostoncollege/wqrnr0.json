In undergrad I would\u2019ve said screw it, what\u2019s one day of class? But I\u2019ve heard grad school is different and it\u2019s *crucial* to attend all your classes. What do y\u2019all think?",

            "comment": "Grad student here (although, not in your field, but I am at BC!). Going to classes is important, that is correct. I can't speak to how detrimental missing class would be given your specific situation. However, professors always like hearing about things like this sooner rather than later. For example, maybe on the day you miss one of your profs has a small group activity planned. They'd probably be upset when one of the students is just missing. \n\nSo, here's what I would do. First, read the syllabus for both classes. Read them carefully. Pay close attention to the attendance policies. Maybe this is a non-issue and the professors make it clear that they don't care if you're there or not! Or maybe they allow you one unexcused absence with no grade penalty. If you're lucky you'll see exactly what they're planning on covering that day in class. Regardless, read the syllabus, and then write them each separate emails explaining the situation, acknowledge you read their respective syllabi, and then if you're requesting additional flexibility or leniency due to a strict syllabus, you may ask then. Do this as soon as you have access to a syllabus. Do not wait. The probability of them not having a problem with it goes down every day you get closer to the event you want to go to. \n\nHope that answers your question! And as a general rule, this is pretty much what I'd tell any student, graduate or undergraduate. Professors generally are pretty chill and lenient as long as you show them respect by reading their class materials and contacting them far in advance. Good luck and I hope you have a great first semester of grad school!!!",

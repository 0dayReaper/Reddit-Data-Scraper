            "comment": "I took that class last semester. The workload consists of readings, studying for the 3 exams, and a group presentation that you do at the end of the semester. The readings are not necessary but they are helpful, especially at the beginning of the semester when you are learning about the immune system. The first exam was done in class, and it was open note. It was pretty hard, but if you did well in Molecules and Cells and your other bio classes then you will be fine. The last 2 exams were take-homes, which made them really easy. There was no final but they will probably change that for the future. \n\nI really liked the class overall, but some parts were a little rough because it was the first time they were teaching the class. But Chiles and Taghian definitely have a better grasp of the class, so I think it will be a lot better.",

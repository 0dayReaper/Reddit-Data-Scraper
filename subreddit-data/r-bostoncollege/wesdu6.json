I\u2019m talkin everywhere\u2026even the shower (you never know when you might see this person). \n\n-Start taking voice lessons and change the tonality of you voice so your voice is not recognized by them. Youtube is a great place to start! \n\n-Legally change your name, waiting period is around a month so it\u2019ll be just in time for new fall semester. \n\nLet me know how it goes!\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffe",

The main ways to see people from other majors during the day are core classes or classes shared between majors/concentrations. Otherwise, it\u2019s just the chances of running into them around campus, at a social event, club meeting, party, etc., which depends on club involvement and social life.",

I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re intending to avoid this person who\u2019s a different major but either way, yes. \n\nMost of my friends are from other majors. Depending on your major (big STEM lecture or small humanities seminars) you\u2019ll see familiar faces in your classes over the years. But I wouldn\u2019t worry. It\u2019s college. A chance to start anew. And besides, it\u2019s a fairly big school so don\u2019t worry. Good luck!",

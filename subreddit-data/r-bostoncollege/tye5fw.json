            "comment": "I'm not doing finance and business analytics, but this combination of concentrations is the most common that I see in CSOM so it is very doable. I can speak for the finance side. \n\nProfessor Elliott Smith seems to be a very polarizing professor. He goes very fast and uses financial lingo regurlarly in his class. I took his fundamentals of finance class and I enjoyed it because he is very practically minded, but his teaching style may be unsuitable for those who have not had much exposure to business/finance in the past. \n\nProfessor Barry does not have the optimal teaching style. He has these prepared notes that he reads from that goes over most peoples heads. I usually walk out of class not really having absorbed anything. However, he is a fair professor in that his tests are exactly on the material covered and have the exact strucutre of the practice problems. \n\nI have heard great things about Professor Sadka and Hotchkiss.",

I've been to the few blocks where this is occuring, and been to a couple demonstrations. And from what I have seen, almost none of the PPB, Multomah Police, or the Fed's response has been warranted. I think I know a little more about this situation. And it is not justified. \n\nJust for fun. Please tell me why the person who looked like Pettibone deserved that. Why was kidnapping him justified? They've admitted that he did nothing wrong.",

Conservatives do not support pushing in the feds unless it is absolutely necessary and legal. The goal is to always keep issues in the US as localized as possible. (Trump talks a lot, but truly follows this principal.).\n3. I could post a million links here proving that your assumption that federal officers' actions are \"unwarranted\" is false. To save time, please look at Andy Ngo's Twitter (And no, he is not a fascist. He is a well-respected journalist. People on here are calling him a fascist because he does not align with their leftist beliefs). He has a ton of actual footage on his Twitter that you would probably find shocking based off of what you have seen. Twitter username: MrAndyNgo. I have watched a lot of footage as well and the RIOTERS/ANTIFA are out of control!\n4. I am exclusively discussing the actions of the feds. The \"kidnappings\" you cited are being blamed on feds. Your cops do absolutely nothing, which is why DHS/DOJ had to send in feds to protect the federal court house ( I support cops, but your police departments are being held back by your mayor and governor etc.).\n5. Feds are not secret police. They wear the insignia of their appropriate organizations, but do not wear name badges since the ANTIFA may retaliate against them and their families. They are permitted to use unmarked vehicles. They must use them since lovely rioters in American cities are blowing up and burning police vehicles. The feds are there to protect federal property and have every right to do so. Further, feds have different rules on detaining and arresting individuals. I advise you read up on them. Pettibone's claims are one-sided and he was released with no charges. CBP released a statement regarding his detainment and said that Pettibone was a suspect of assault against federal agents or destruction of federal property. They also said that they removed him for questioning for safety reasons since a violent mob was nearby during his detainment. After a short questioning, he was released. All legal since he was suspected of a FEDERAL crime. Have you spoken to any feds or police officers? Have you spoken to anyone that is not affiliated with the leftist organizations driving these riots?All individuals arrested  and charged by the feds have info publicly released regarding their charges etc. Their charges are not secrets!  All of this BS about the feds being secret police is leftist propaganda.\n6. Living in or near Portland does not make you an expert on the riots and Antifa. Good for you for partaking in legal peaceful protests! I highly doubt you are associated with the anarchists who keep trying to burn down/blow up the federal court house.",

Please tell me why you want people who do nothing illegal to be taken off the streets by unidentifiable people.\n\nOur cops have barely been held back by Ted. Also, bureau.

It is perfectly legal for federal officers to use tear gas if they follow proper procedures and find it warranted. You are no longer peacefully protesting if you refuse to disband and continually ignore the commands of law enforcement officers. It is also not a peaceful protest if any involved start throwing projectiles at officers.\n2. Portland is a shit-show. Every single news source reports the supposed protests as riots. People are blowing stuff up, harming police and federal officers, and burning stuff. There is plenty of video evidence to support this. This is not a conservative argument. This is a fact.  Even good old CNN and NYT report that there are riots in Portland.\n3. Milkshake incident.... You are referring to the assault in Portland where Andy Ngo was attacked by \"protesters\" and hospitalized. There is video footage of that as well. That was illegal and an assault. Leftist media tried to spin it another way, but other journalists on site verified his assault and had video. It does not surprise me that you believed the word of leftist media.\n4. I already told you about the statements from the CBP. He was not kidnapped. His very temporary detainment was legal and warranted per federal law. He was never charged with a crime. He was brought in for questioning regarding a suspected crime. Even if it makes you cry, it is not illegal if it is in line with the law. Unless you were a first-hand witness to the whole scenario, you have no leg to stand on. And yes, your mayor told Portland police to stand down. Why do you think the feds had to come in to defend the court house?\n5. Again, what the feds are doing is perfectly legal if they have reason to believe that detained individuals have committed a FEDERAL crime. They also have laws that dictate what they can and can't do. It is not a free for all like you are describing. You clearly only follow the leftist MSM.\n6. There is a ton of video footage showing the rioters trying to blow up and burn down the court house. The rioters launched fireworks at the courthouse. Fireworks are a type of explosive.\n\n&gt;We clearly won't see eye-to-eye on this since it is clear that you only follow the leftist MSM. You definitely have a warped sense of reality, though, if you think that everything in Portland is just a peaceful protest. If you want the feds to leave, encourage the \"peaceful protesters\" to stop blowing shit up and damaging things.",

Is sexually assaulting someone proper procedure? Is attacking medics and journalists proper procedure? Is zero warning proper procedure?\n\n2. Again, have you actually looked around in the City of Portland? Barely looks touched outside about 5ish blocks?\n\n3. I'm referring to Andy trying to say that those milkshakes were quickdry cement. They weren't. The chemistry doesn't even make sense. Yes, it was assault. But no, there was no \"cement\" involved. \n\nAnyways, https://www.portlandmercury.com/blogtown/2019/08/26/27039560/undercover-in-patriot-prayer-insights-from-a-vancouver-democrat-whos-been-working-against-the-far-right-group-from-the-inside\n\n4. No, this was not legal. 'The agents, Cline says, were interested in the man in the video because, earlier, they'd seen him \"in a crowd and in an area\" where someone ELSE was aiming a laser at the eyes of officers. The police do not have probable cause to arrest you just because you are standing near someone else who may have committed a crime. Cline goes on to say that the agents followed the man in the video\u2014whom they had no basis to arrest\u2014to a calmer location, away from the courthouse, because they wanted to question him.So far as the Fourth Amendment goes, if that\u2019s all they\u2019d actually done, there wouldn\u2019t be an issue. The police are allowed to walk up to you and question you, in a \u201cconsensual\u201d encounter, so long as a reasonable person in your shoes would think it's ok for you to walk away. Maybe these agents planned to execute one of those \u201cconsensual\u201d encounters, maybe not. But in any event, Cline admits\u2014and the video is clear\u2014that they did something very different: they forcibly removed the man from the scene.' \n\nThere was no lawful basis to detain the man in the popular van video.\n\n5. The feds had NO reason to believe that the detailed individual comitted a federal crime. They admitted it themselves. They detained someone because they were \"in a crowd and in an area\". This is NOT a Federal crime. The reason they detained someone was NOT because of suspicion of a federal crime.\n\n6. \"the rioters trying to blow up\"\n\nWhat, they have pounds of tnt or something?\n\n\nAs to your last point. I am not a big fan of MSM. I have largely made my opinion on this matter up with a combination of watching Robert Evans livestream (so what is actually occurring in real time),  attending some of the demonstrations, and actually seeing the city. Yes, not every protest is peaceful. But from what I have seen, they have largely become violent when kettled and attacked first.",

Portland \"protesters\" barricaded federal officers inside the courthouse the other day and tried to burn it down with them trapped inside. I'm all ears if you show me where MLK advocated that. I have never seen an MLK protest with a dollar figure attached to cleaning up graffiti or vandalism. MLK would have been ashamed of these people, just like he was ashamed of Malcolm X. MLK was very cognizant of making sure that he and his followers protested in a way that got the other side or neutral third parties to be sympathetic of their cause. If MLK launched a protest movement and one of the results was record high gun background checks because people were worried his followers were going to hurt them, he'd consider the protest to be a failure.\n\nPepper spray lingers. It moves with the wind. If someone is \"pepper sprayed\" because they are standing next to or near someone who is violating the law, they should reconsider their choice of evening activities...\n\nLol again. 'Portland is beautiful except for 5 blocks.' I will say it again: Martin Luther King never led a protest that caused damage to public or private property. He would be ashamed of this.\n\nPortland Police have reiterated the claim that there were cement milkshakes thrown back then. Not interested in relitigating that, but when the debate is not over whether assault was committed, but rather whether it rose to the level of attempted murder or assault with a deadly weapon, I think you would agree that the notion of a \"peaceful counter protest\" goes out the window...\n\nThe argument over the legality of these arrests is one that will be argued out in court. The law enforcement officers believe that they had probable cause to conduct an arrest. If they caught the wrong guy, it won't be the first time that has happened, but that doesn't necessarily mean there is any malice involved. You admit that police were assaulted by someone in a group. These aren't cops conducting a traffic stop. They are responding to an assault. Their suspects are all masked and running away. Their window to catch the perp is small. If they don't catch him/her then and there, they never will. If the arrest is not by the book, then the accused has nothing to worry about.\n\nYou are far too confident that the accused in the van video did not violate a federal law. Whether it is purely an academic exercise or not, there is an argument to be made that at least some of the elements of these \"protests\" have risen to the level of terrorism. Meaning, terrorism uses violence or the fear of violence to achieve a political result. You don't get to participate in violence like this and then cry that it was actually the guy next to you who did x, y, and z, not you. If he is innocent, then that will come out in court.  It is far too early to say definitively that no laws were broken by the accused. Most defendents profess their innocence.\n\nYes, the rioters tried to destroy the courthouse with explosives. They broke the windows and then tossed fireworks inside. As far as the law is concerned, there is no difference between using a firework to destroy federal property or using a hand grenade or a rocket launcher. A firework used in that manner is still a destructive device, which, without the proper ATF permitting, carries the same jail sentence as using an unlicensed machine gun in the commission of a crime. You are free to have your own opinion, but the National Firearms Act of 1934 is clear on the matter. And the agency responsible for enforcing the law surrounding Title II weaponry? The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, who are among the Federal agents deployed.\n\nIf the \"protesters\" don't like that ATF is on the ground, maybe they should stop flagrantly violating the National Firearms Act? Just a suggestion...",

I feel like you just don't know MLK. \u201cWe do not need allies who are more devoted to order than to justice.........If our direct action programs alienate our friends\u2026.they never were really our friends.\u201d, I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to \"order\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: \"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\". Not only the above quotes, but MLK was assassinated shortly after beginning to become a little more militant. \n\n\"MLK was very cognizant of making sure that he and his followers protested in a way that got the other side or neutral third parties to be sympathetic of their cause.\"\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/martin-luther-king-jr-was-not-always-popular-back-day-780387. \n\nBefore his death, MLK had a~66% *disapproval* rating. Your above sentiment is not compatible.\n\n\"Pepper spray lingers. It moves with the wind. If someone is \"pepper sprayed\" because they are standing next to or near someone who is violating the law, they should reconsider their choice of evening activities...\"\n\nGuilty by association is not a thing, and neither is punishment by association. Also, I wasn't even referring to people getting sprayed. I was referring to medical equipment, medic tents, and food getting sprayed. \n\nYou just gonna ignore the sexual assault? Like seriously? Are Feds committing sexual assault just ok to you?\n\nThe point also was, Portland is not a shitshow. Most people in this city would barely even know the protesting was happening if not for the word of mouth.\n\n\"I think you would agree that the notion of a \"peaceful counter protest\" goes out the window..\"\n\nNot my argument. My argument here is that Andy Ngo lost his credibility by lying. And are you going to ignore the Mercury Article?\n\n\"The argument over the legality of these arrests is one that will be argued out in court. The law enforcement officers believe that they had probable cause to conduct an arrest.\"\n\nSo you have no interest in making a good faith argument? They've admitted that they didn't have probable cause. They didn't chase him down because they suspected him of pointing a laser at the Fed. They chased him down because he was in a group where someone else did. That is an unlawful arrest, and imo is an act of terrorism by the feds. Any unlawful arrest with a political agenda is. \n\n\"If the arrest is not by the book, then the accused has nothing to worry about.\"\n\nAside from rough rides, sexual assault, getting pepper sprayed and beaten (like that Navy vet), etc. But you know, who cares about that.\n\n\"You don't get to participate in violence like this and then cry that it was actually the guy next to you who did x, y, and z, not you.\"\n\nHe wasn't suspected of participating in violence. \n\n\"If the \"protesters\" don't like that ATF is on the ground, maybe they should stop flagrantly violating the National Firearms Act? Just a suggestion...\"\n\nIf the Feds don't like that the protesters are participating in riot-like activities sometimes, then they shouldn't assault, kettle, and attack the crowd first. Just a suggestion...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=katXqjuJNmI&amp;feature=emb_logo\n\n^ The protesters are not instigating violent conflicts.",

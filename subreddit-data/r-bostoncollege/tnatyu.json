            "comment": "Congrats on your acceptance!  MCAS Econ grad ('10) here.\n\nSince I didn't get a BA from other schools, it's hard to compare exactly what would have been different, but overall I am happy with the education since I went into business.  I ended up going back to Grad school to get a MS because BC's program didn't have enough mathematical rigor for my career.  For example I had been exposed to some multivariate calculus / Hessian matrices, but it was devoid of stochastic calculus and modeling.  I'm not sure how much these are taught at other Universities at a BA level.\n\nMost of my professors were either fantastic or fine.  Class size was good (small enough to interact with professors directly), and the requirements allowed me to graduate in 6 semesters.  I spent a year studying abroad and that's something many students can't afford to do and graduate in 4 years, and it really shaped who I am now and what I decided to do with my life.\n\nDownside - I think it's changed now, but when I was there most of my classes were in old ass buildings.  It felt like high school to go to class and did make me a little upset that I was spending so much money to sit in the basement.  But they've done a lot of new construction so I think this is resolved.\n\nOverall, as long as you're looking to do something in Business / Finance / Corporate work, it's a good program.  If you want to go into research to do PhD work you probably need to take more math courses (which B.C. does offer).  Many of my classmates that did a double major in math were much more prepared than I was for higher level mathematics concepts.",

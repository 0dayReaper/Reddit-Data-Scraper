    "postText": "Prospective PhD student here! I'm very excited to mention that I'm likely choosing BC for my graduate education, and I was curious whether anybody knew if PhD students had access to facilities at other Boston schools for being a local student. For example, I believe that Harvard's libraries require an ID card, but would a BC ID card suffice? It would be really awesome to have a variety of study/work spaces to choose from around the city and wondered if there were any perks at these places for being a Boston student more generally. Thanks in advance!",

For example, one of Harvard's libraries requires ID card access to even enter the building. But hey, it's super reassuring to know I'll have access to the materials. Thank you so much!!",

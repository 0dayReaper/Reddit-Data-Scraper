They do a good job breaking down Boston College\u2019s woes this year. \n\nShort version: the offensive line is starting walk ons and defense lineman. This is due to injuries of course. PJ sucks and we realized that this past weekend against Duke when Morehead banged out 4 TDs. \n\nDefense has a higher ceiling than the stats say. Lots of playmakers on that side of the ball.",

Phil is inaccurate and making poorer decision than he did in 2020 and 2021, but even when he does have time, he\u2019s on the ground. \n\nI\u2019m honestly shocked at how bad the O Line is, we\u2019ve been spoiled with either good or great O Line\u2019s for years, and not only the physicality but the communication is just bad for that unit across the board. \n\nZay is thankfully still helping his draft stock for the Spring, and I hope he gets paid!",

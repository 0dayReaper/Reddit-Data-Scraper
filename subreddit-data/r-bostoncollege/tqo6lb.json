I can\u2019t find any online for the life of me and the floor layout on BC\u2019s website gives almost 0 info. \nYou can message me privately if you don\u2019t feel like posting pics here! \nOr just describe the space? How big? How many desks to a room? Are the beds bunked? \nAny info would be sooo helpful",

            "comment": "Beds can be bunked or left separate (lofting isn't a thing in 90). The room comes with 3 dressers and 1 desk. If you choose to bunk (which is what we did), you can add desks. sometimes facilities will ask you to get permission from the RD for the changes. The closets are a decent size, but you have to share since there are only 2. The common room is a good size for 6 people, but not many more than that. The bathroom is a good size as well and the shower and toilet are separate from the sink area. Overall, it's not too bad, but it can feel pretty cramped at times.",

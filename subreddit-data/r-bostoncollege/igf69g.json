Here's what it looks like with some fake data: [https://imgur.com/a/LaO2Uwr](https://imgur.com/a/LaO2Uwr), but hopefully the real data never gets that interesting. All my data sources are linked at the bottom of the page.\n\nIf you have any suggestions of things to add/change, please let me know. Or, do it yourself and submit a PR, it's open source!",

A quick suggestion/question: on the horizontal axes of some of the graphs, the distance between dates is inconsistent, e.g. the data point for 8/28 on the cumulative test graphs is much closer to the 8/29 data point than the 8/27 one. Is there a reason for this inconsistent spacing? I feel it makes discerning trends a bit confusing.",

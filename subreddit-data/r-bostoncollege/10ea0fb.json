    "postText": "Hey everyone! I'm currently in my senior year of undergraduate college and will be pursuing the MS in Finance (Quantitative) program at Boston College beginning this fall (Fall 23').  I had a doubt regarding the total number of credits that I need to enter under the 'Enrollment' heading in the \"Graduate and Law Students Supplemental Information for Financial Aid\" form provided by BC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fgstwrsn9lca1.png?width=593&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c50e16a23befba8a4f3b620532ff2f18cb8bafc4\n\nI had initially filled in \"30 credits\" besides \"Fall 2023\" as the program consists of 10 courses of 3 credits each and. However, upon submitting, I was informed by my financial aid counselor that I am required to enter the exact number of credits that I would be taking PER SEMESTER and that I should contact the graduate student services for obtaining information. I've sent them an email 2 days ago but have received no reply till date.\n\nAs per the website, the BC's MSF program is comprised of 10 courses where 4,4, and 2 courses are completed in the fall, spring and summer semesters respectively. So am I supposed to enter 12,12, and 6 in the blanks? The problem with this is that there is no blank for me to enter the number of credits for the summer semester in 2024. \n\nReally confused on what to fill in. Any help would be much appreciated!",

            "comment": "Assuming each course is 3 credits (that\u2019s something you should double check to confirm) you\u2019d be taking 12 credits in the fall and spring, yes. You\u2019d probably just have to fill out this form again next spring and state then that you\u2019re taking 6 credits for the summer of \u201824. 100% recommend double checking with your program and/or graduate student services especially since your financial aid counselor told you to do the latter.\n\nDon\u2019t worry too much about needing to get this fixed immediately, you\u2019re well ahead of the curve on getting financial aid figured out for next year, and the financial aid department is super committed to making sure you get the aid you\u2019re entitled to and won\u2019t let small things like this hurt ya. Just reach out to graduate student services again if you don\u2019t hear back within a week and follow up with your counselor if you don\u2019t hear again after that. It\u2019ll all work out!",

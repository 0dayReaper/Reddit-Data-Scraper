I\u2019ve played a lot of games over the summer and have almost 20 board games that i\u2019m bringing back to BC with me but the BC board game scene is literally dead.\n\nMy favorite games are Dune and Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion, but I have my BGG collection linked below.\n\n[BGG Collection](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/mylesgrxnt)",

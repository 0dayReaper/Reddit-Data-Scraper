I was just planning on finishing my major class requirements and my elective requirements (I finished all my core requirements) but is there something else I have to do or some class I have to take to graduate?",

During the second semester of junior year I emailed my academic advisor asking if writing a thesis was required to graduate, and she said it was not. \n\nThat said, looking back on my time at BC I personally wish that I had written a thesis, but it's not required to get your degree. It is only required for specific programs like honors for example.",

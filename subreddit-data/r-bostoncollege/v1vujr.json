Given the \"practicum\", I assume the course has a heavier emphasis on conversation? But then I see a course called German Composition and Conversation and now I'm not sure what the differences are.\n\nIf anyone could help clear up my confusion I'd very thankful.",

You go to the Elementary German class and learn things like grammar or culture (and some speaking), and then you go to the practicum and do exclusively speaking.\n\n\nAlso it's an easy A generally speaking (at least for French practicum it was), and 1 credit-hour so if you stick with the practicums as you go through the semesters (you can take the practicum independently of the actual German class), you can get some nice extra credits and take less classes when you're a senior.",

I enjoy language learning as a hobby so spend lots of time outside of class listening, reading, and even speaking with native speakers. I also know people who have taken CCR (comp and conv) and can understand *fine*, but can barely speak. I have not taken CCR yet so I can\u2019t say personally, but I\u2019m definitely more comfortable than most simply because I practice a lot on my own.\n\nYou cannot succeed in a language class by simply relying on the professor and the book. Explore, learn, find a topic you\u2019re interested in (for me it\u2019s music), and challenge yourself. Then, you\u2019re 90% of the way there. The rest is time and practice",

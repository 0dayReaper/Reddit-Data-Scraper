I loved my mentors and some of the advice they gave me still sticks with me today, plus I was able to make a close friend through the program. The way Compass works (at least for me) was that we were divided into groups with two mentors, and we would meet each week and play games. I had a good experience but every group did different activities, so I did hear that other people in the program had different experiences than I did. The Compass program isn't really influenced by Christianity at all. I don't recall if Christianity ever came up in any Compass discussion, and many of the participants also had different religions/backgrounds outside of Christianity. Hope this helps!",

I wasn\u2019t part of the program as a first year but was a mentor last fall and will be one again this upcoming semester :)",

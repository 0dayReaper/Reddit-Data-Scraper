The trade-off of this is that forced triples only existed on Upper Campus, so opting into a forced triple guarantees Upper Campus housing. Personally, I lived on Newton campus and yes that bus is really annoying but it wasn't that bad at all. Like the other commenter said though forced triples have not existed due to COVID, and nobody knows if they're bringing it back.",

If you request a quad (if the triple was based on getting know more people - which can happen w/o roomies btw, no worries), there is like a whole building with them on Upper so you\u2019re likely to be there then. Though I know for sure there are at least a couple quads in almost every building on Newton and Upper",

BC\u2019s positivity rate has been below 1% all semester (.77 last week), and the city of Boston has consistently been coming in with positivity rates above 5%. Not one student has been hospitalized, and all have recovered showing little to no symptoms. Why is the narrative continuously shaming BC and the student body? Meanwhile, the university just pulled off what many people over the summer portrayed as a death sentence in bringing ~9000 undergraduates on campus for some form of in person learning for the fall semester. If anything a successful and healthy Aug-Nov, is a testament to the community for abiding by the guidelines and the admin for setting up a solid testing infrastructure.",

It went better than expected, sure, but I don't think that necessarily means BC should be \"praised\" for its relatively lackluster COVID response compared to other schools.",

Even then, the amount of positives were really high when looked at next to comparable populations. We shouldn't have a similar number to BU or schools that are 3 to 4 times the size.",

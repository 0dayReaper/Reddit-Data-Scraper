I wanted to get ahead a bit and look through the textbook in advance, but it wasn't posted on the bookstore's website yet. Anyone know the name of the textbook used for Calculus I with that Professor or even their own class in the past? Thanks!",

You\u2019ll learn it in due time so for now, just enjoy the last month of summer and recharge! Welcome to the Heights!",

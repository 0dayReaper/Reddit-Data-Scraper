    "postText": "Hi, me, a 22 year old female (Indian, if that's relevant), along with my friend (also of the same description) are looking for 2 roommates to either join in an existing apartment/lease or look for apartments together. We are both grad students joining CSOM this Fall. We are actively looking for 4 beds, 2 baths in Brighton and Allston areas (the closer to BC, the better cos night classes). Our rent range is around $900 per person. We are both clean and friendly and looking for similar people! DM me if you're interested!",

I'm an international student from India admitted into Boston College's 1 year MS in Finance (full-time) program and couldn't be more excited to join campus starting this fall.   \nLooking to create a whatsapp/telegram group for discussing about all things BC- Boston accommodation, course registration, part-time work etc etc. Feel free to PM if you're in the same boat as me!",

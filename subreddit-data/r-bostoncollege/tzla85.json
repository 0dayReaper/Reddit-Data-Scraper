    "postText": "I'm a biology major trying to double major in math. I'm finishing up my sophomore year, and I've taken up to Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra. Due to scheduling conflicts, I can only take Intro to Abstract Math in junior spring, not junior fall. The issue is I've heard you should take Abstract Algebra and Abstract Analysis after Intro to Abstract Math.\n\nSo should I try taking Algebra 1/2, Analysis 1/2 junior year? In the Fall, I'd be taking Algebra/Analysis 1 before Abstract Math. In the Spring, I'd be taking Algebra/Analysis 2 alongside Abstract Math.\n\nOr should I just cram Algebra 1/2, Analysis 1/2, and all other required math major classes in Senior Year? (not sure how difficult this would be)",

            "comment": "I majored in math. I would take into to abstract as soon as you can. The math classes above multi variable and linear algebra are very proof based, so knowing how proofs work (what you learn in intro to abstract) is pretty important. I would be worried that waiting until senior year to cram all your math classes might get a little difficult especially trying to complete the elective requirements. Have you talked to an advisor in the math department about it?",

            "comment": "I definitely would not take Algebra and Analysis until you\u2019ve done Abstract Math. I thought Abstract was actually a required prereq for those classes, but maybe not anymore. Anyway, learning how to write proper proofs is essential to those classes and that\u2019s what you learn in Abstract",

            "comment": "if you want to take analysis/algebra 1 first, there\u2019s no reason you need to take intro to abstract math anymore. You can switch that with an elective with chairs approval. \ni think no electives have analysis or algebra in their prereq, so you can fill those in your junior year if you decide to take analysis/algebra in senior year. some of them has intro to abstract math in prereq tho.",

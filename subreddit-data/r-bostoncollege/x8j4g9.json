Or do people really tend to stay on campus during free time? I prefer a more campus-y school.",

I didn\u2019t keep up with the latter for all of their ventures but worth noting that it\u2019s really dependent on who you meet and their comfortability leaving the BC bubble (which as others have said here, is a very real phenomenon).",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI recently committed to Boston College and want to visit the campus on June 1 since I will be in Boston. I missed the May 19 transfer orientation because I had a final for a class that I obviously could not miss. Do you think I can just walk in and explore the campus? Or should I call and let them know I'm coming in advance. During the online orientation, they did say they would accommodate us on different days but I don't know how true it is.",

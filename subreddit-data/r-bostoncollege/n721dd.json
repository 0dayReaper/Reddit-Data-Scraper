Of those in your class that completed the survey, a vast majority of you expressed a preference for a celebratory event (ideally during a fall football weekend), while a significant number of you asked for something that replicates the feel of a degree ceremony and that can include your parents. After much consideration, we are excited to offer you an experience that includes both of these elements.\n\nI write today to invite you and your parents back to the Heights during the weekend of October 15-17, 2021 for a fun-filled celebration of the Class of 2020! Here is the slate of activities we are planning:\n\nSaturday, October 16 - \n\nBC vs. NC State Football Gameday Experience\n\nAn exclusive Class of 2020 Pre-game Tailgate*\n\nSpecial in-game recognition of the Class of 2020\n\nPost-game on field photo opportunities for the Class of 2020 and family members\n\nSunday, October 17\n\nBaccalaureate Mass - 10:00 a.m.\n\nDegree Recognition Ceremony - 11:00 a.m.\n\nCelebration of the Class of 2020; a festive luncheon - immediately following the Degree Recognition Ceremony\n\n*Times for Saturday activities will be determined once we know the kickoff time for the football game, which will be announced by the ACC closer to the date.\n\nWe have also worked with many hotels in the Boston area to offer a wide selection of rates and locations. For more information, including hotel accommodations, please click here.\n\nPlease also note that, at this time, plans for the fall remain subject to change should the University be required to adhere to restrictions placed on large gatherings. We are mindful that almost all of you asked that in-person events only happen when physical distancing protocols are lifted. Should things shift, we will adjust our plans. In short: fingers crossed!",

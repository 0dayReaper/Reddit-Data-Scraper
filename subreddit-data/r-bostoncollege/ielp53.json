    "postText": "I\u2019ve had my gripes w/ school administration on a myriad of issues over the past couple of years, but this is the one rare moment I\u2019m gonna say this: just please be compliant. The biggest concern as of now is the issue of testing beyond the move-in period, but we still have a responsibility to call each other out on any bullshit that we see each other doing. Students have the power to keep ourselves on campus or send us all back home. \n\nI\u2019ve done my fair share of partying and going out at BC, but if you know of a party happening on or off-campus, try to get it shut down. It really isn\u2019t worth it to allow things to slide because our friends are hosting/attending/DJ\u2019ing. We all know better at this point, and we\u2019ve seen what happens at other schools when people are too lax. \n\nIf you see people roaming about w/o masks, call them out. It isn\u2019t worth it to see people wearing chinstraps and acting like it\u2019s the norm. Abandon the BC lookaways, and interact w/ your fellow students if you see them being non-compliant. It\u2019s only going to hurt us in the long run if we let little things slide. Father Leahy isn\u2019t out here on the quad  telling people to be socially distant, and he never will be either. We have to act for ourselves and keep BC on the heights. \n\nFor the number of you on this sub saying that BC is trying to drain our pockets and issue as little of a refund as possible, fair enough. I\u2019ll agree with you for non-argument\u2019s sake. Let\u2019s run that logic. Let\u2019s play that game. But we actually have to win it. Thinking that BC is the one in control of our entire financial situation and will just pull the plug is exactly what will get us sent home. We have to be better about correcting those on campus who think they\u2019re above the rules, so we as a community can be better off. I got a lot of love and a lot of hate for this dumbass school, but I\u2019d rather be here than be home on Zoom the entire time. It isn\u2019t beneficial for people like me in a crowded home environment to take classes on zoom. I fucking struggled those last couple months while I was at home, and I know there are others who share that sentiment. I want us to be safe so there isn\u2019t a reason to complain about anyone down the road. \n\nThanks for listening to my rant, but TL:DR, keep yourself safe upon arrival.",

            "comment": "Thanks for this. I agree there\u2019s a middle ground between the attitudes of \u201cBC\u2019s plan is so deficient we\u2019ll get sent home\u201d and \u201cthe admin is doing all it can for us.\u201d That middle ground involves holding everyone accountable\u2014admin and students\u2014while realizing that neither party will always do the right thing. I\u2019m not trying to be a shill for the admin here, but it\u2019s pretty clear that the direct cause of ND and UNC moving online was student gatherings. Yes, more robust testing would\u2019ve helped, but it wouldn\u2019t have kept students from partying. Anyways, now is the time to be realistic about the fact that, like it or not, we\u2019re all in this together, and each of us has a role to play in keeping us on campus this fall. Let\u2019s not give the admin any reason to blame students for whatever is going to happen, because we all know they\u2019ll pounce on any chance to shift blame.",

            "comment": "Of course everyone should act responsibly, wear mask at all times, and not go to parties. But ND needed to do 30k - 50k tests a week top operate safely, unless you think you know better than the Yale School of Public Health. Instead ND did 400 tets in its first 3 weeks. Focusing on individual behavior while ignoring systematic failures is like trying to combat climate change by telling people to turn down the heat and use energy efficient lightbulbs. There isn't a single instance where 10k students  will be brought back to a campus and 100% will behave responsibly 100% of the time. Everyone knows this in advance. Hoping it happens and moreover your plan depending on it happening is idiotic, and destined to fail. It's like BC picking 11 random students to be the starting offense vs Alabama and saying the success of our plan depends on your performance. The only actual way to keep people on campus safely and control the spread of the virus, is by doing thousands of tests a day, catching the inevitable cases early, and isolating those people before they infect others. That is how you manage a pandemic. Not by crossing your fingers that things work out becasue everyone will make perfect decisions. On top of that RA's are being told in trainings that BCPD and others will not enforce mask and other guidelines, leaving it to unpaid studetns to enforce the rules??? This is insane. People who want to have a semester should be demanding the school institute a rigorous testing regime loudly.",

You seem to understand that the literature is published, and that we could do things in a much safer fashion. It isn\u2019t a \u201cconfusing position,\u201d it\u2019s the hand that\u2019s being dealt to me by my place of education. I can\u2019t fight them on this; I\u2019m on campus, I\u2019ve been tested, and I\u2019ve paid my tuition. The issues you\u2019ve raised are ones I had initially, and continue to have. Yet complaining isn\u2019t gonna help me anymore, I have to act. I can\u2019t afford the luxury of sitting in an armchair in my home and yelling about systemic inadequacies. A couple months ago, sure. Now, however, I have to live this. So I\u2019m encouraging others to act in the same way.",

We aren't going to stop demanding making this point. You never just have to accept something if it isn't right.\n\nBC is planning on having a football season too. We probably can't stop that either. But we aren't going to stop speaking out about how exploitative and unsafe this is.",

I'm saying that move-in is next week, and hardly anything has changed since their initial plan. If you plan on being the activist on campus against BC admin, then i just hope you and the others are safe. Just be real with yourself. The only time BC has faltered in their initial plans to do anything is if state and federal governments step up against them. BC has been receiving the complaints from students and faculty since June, and the only stance they've taken that changed was when Mass. announced their statement on self-quarantine for travelers from high-risk states. I fully agree with the notion of advocating against injustice, but how long can you advocate before you yourself are fully thrust in the situation with little options to move forward? BC isn't going to budge until they recognize an increase in positive cases over the first few weeks of testing beyond the move-in period, and thinking otherwise shows you haven't fought against BC administration before.\n\nAlso, BC isn't having a football season as of yet, they're in training. No hard stance has been taken on a full season as of yet.",

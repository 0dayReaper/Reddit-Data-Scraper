    "postText": "I'm working with a professor to apply for a research grant for Spring 2023 so I can TA her classes and do a project with her. Last spring, we located the webpage with all the submission information and deadlines (all of which were in August). Now that it's August we're trying to remember the deadlines and submit everything but the webpage is gone. I'm not applying for one of BC's UG research fellowships, but that's the only thing I can find. Are we just not doing this type of grant anymore? I can't even figure out who to email to inquire about this. Does anyone know?",

    "postText": "Hi! I am a senior in high school who applied to BC in RD and am planning on majoring in finance. I have heard a lot of great things about Carroll and was wondering if people have had good experiences there. I was also wondering if there a lot of opportunities with Big 3/4 consulting, IB, and asset management. \n\nThanks!",

If accepted it\u2019s reputation is a higher tier business school that, if you do well can get you interviews/ internships. There\u2019s other schools in higher tiers but BC is considered a solid choice",

I am hoping to break into IB, and the network here is incredible. Numerous bankers have actually reached out to me for a conversation, which has been so cool. Also, the upperclassmen are incredibly supportive and helpful. They are awesome mentors. Definitely weigh all your options, but if u r interest in banking or consulting BC should be a top choice for you",

I saw friends who I would say were more fit/prepared for IB and still didnt get a job. Now going to BC will certainly help you but it wont determine if you get any of those jobs. The job application process is similar to college application process- you never know who and why people get picked but you do everything in your control to increase your odds of getting picked. I recommend start looking/researching about those jobs towards the end of your freshman year and then begin networking early sophomore year. As someone who saw myself and friends go through the job application process there really is no rhyme or reason why people get hired honestly it sucks and its not more talked about so I am just saying it here bc I wish I knew. I went to career fairs and had senior connections at companies I applied to and still did not get an offer. I knew absolutely no one at BOFA and did not network at all. I cold applied to an internship posting and ended up making it all the way through. Sooo all to say honestly your school is not the determining factor-its you and the universe\u2026",

Prospective grad student here(masters program in mental health counseling), is there absolutely zero chance of living on campus?\n\nWhere is the best place to live if you don't have a car?\n\nThings I care about: NO BUGS OF ANY KIND, ESPECIALLY ROACHES, noise level normal, walking distance to campus or convenient transportation to campus, CLEAN, safe, studio or 1b1b with in unit laundry. If its furnished and include wifi and utility that is definitely a plus becuse I am lazy\ud83e\udd23\n\nI expect I will be going to the education department a lot, so maybe close to that? \n\nI can accept higher prices since its boston but not like 5000 a month please\ud83e\udd23any advice/experience/suggestions is highly appreciated!",

I am not sure how much competition there is for that. \n\nAs for the best living off campus options, it\u2019s best to live along the BC shuttle routes (Comm Ave or Newton routes) [link](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/offices/auxiliary-services/sites/transportation-parking/shuttles.html). \n\nFYI that it is not as easy as you\u2019d hope to find an apartment in Newton or Brighton with in-unit laundry. I guess you could check out Apartments.com to see what pops up.",

            "comment": "Hi there! Incoming PhD student here! I already live in the area and have lived in my apartment for two years now. The Brighton area around Cleveland Circle/Comm Ave is pretty safe and I've heard of other grad students living in this area as well! If you're worried about noise though, look on side streets in this area because there tends to be a lot of traffic. You'll also definitely want anything along the B line, or close to the B line because it'll take you right to campus, if you don't have a car! In-unit laundry may be really tough, but if you can score an apartment super close to a laundromat, it won't feel like too much of a chore. I also live with my long-term partner and the rent is manageable that way. I highly recommend searching for roommates, if possible. Just takes a lot of the financial pressure off when you're not doing it alone!! \n\nGood luck and feel free to DM with any more specific questions about the area! I'm happy to answer them! \u263a\ufe0f",

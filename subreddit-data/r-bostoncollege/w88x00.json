At my hs most people don\u2019t date outside their race and idk I just don\u2019t want to go to a college that\u2019s the same way. \n\n3) thanks!",

But for your second one, at times bc can feel cliquey but because you are always meeting new people in class, at school events, on your floor, and parties you have a lot of opportunities to meet people outside of your \u201cgroup\u201d. Especially freshman year the group of people you hang out with will constantly be growing and changing. So from what I have noticed, people date others different from them in terms of races, groups, and even countries.",

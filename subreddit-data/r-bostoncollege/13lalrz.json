Pchem (chemistry track) was the hardest class I took at BC. On the other hand, my roommate who took the premed version said it was a complete joke compared to the material I was being taught. \n\nFor analytical chemistry, it was way easier than orgo (honors version) but I think this depends on the person (both are very logical but it's different ways of thinking imo). The lab portion is definitely a lot more difficult because of how nitpicky it is.",

For instance, I'm sure you've perhaps manipulated the gram masses for your products in Orgo lab or played with the numbers to better fit in your lab report. You can't do that in A-Chem lab; they will record what your product mass was during that lab session so you don't fiddle with the numbers later. Same goes for every piece of data you collect.\n\nI'd say that's pretty unfair considering the lab course grades are harshly assigned as is (I think only 1-2 people can get an A per section) and that type of standard is obviously more suited for actual research. But if you want to stick with the Biochem major and go through A-Chem and P-Chem, you can certainly do so, but to me it seemed like a headache not worth going through, and I certainly wasn't going to risk my GPA for Biochem.",

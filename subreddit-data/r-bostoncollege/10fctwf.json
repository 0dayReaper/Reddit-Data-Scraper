The fact it was in Boston and in the Big East had a greater impact.   I specifically told this family member that BC wasn't overly religious.  It was there if you wanted,  but it wasn't shoved down your throat.   The theology classes are scholarly without any agenda.  There are a lot of non practicing catholics and some non catholics.  A Jewish friend in our friend group had a great experience.  If my kid gets the grades, I might encourage him to apply.",

It depends on the professor of course but I found that their approach to teaching the subject is much more literary and historically focused than I expected which would appeal to more non-religious people.",

    "postText": "Northeastern is [testing every student 3 times](https://news.northeastern.edu/2020/08/05/northeasterns-life-sciences-center-is-a-cutting-edge-laboratory-that-will-process-the-universitys-coronavirus-tests/) upon their return; on the first day, third day, and fifth day back. The reason is if someone contacts the virus during their travels, at an airport or on a plane for example, the viral load may not show up on a test taken in the first day or two. You can test negative on when you return, but it doesn't mean you don't have the virus, it just means the viral load  hasn't built up to a testable level yet. That's why NU is testing people on day 3 and 5.\n\nWith 10k students returning, it is likely there will be people who were infected shortly before they left or during their travels. Even if it is an extremely small number, it only takes 1 person to spread the disease to friends, roommates, or people they share a bathroom with.\n\nFrom MIT Medical.\u00a0\n\n\"All of this is why we\u2019re not recommending that people make decisions about their activities or contacts based on the results of a negative test shortly after possible exposure. For example, it\u2019s not a good idea to fly into Boston on a crowded flight, get a COVID-19 diagnostic test within a day or two of arrival, and then, based on a negative result, visit your elderly grandparents. The only thing that negative test can tell you is that, at that particular moment in time, your sample did not show viral levels high enough to be reliably measured. It does not mean you were not exposed and infected during your travels. It does not mean you were not exposed and infected after your arrival. Do you want to visit your grandparents after flying into Boston? Self quarantine for 14 days first.\"\n\n[https://medical.mit.edu/covid-19-updates/2020/07/when-should-i-be-tested](https://medical.mit.edu/covid-19-updates/2020/07/when-should-i-be-tested)\n\nPeople seem to think we are being overly critical of BC, and are defending BC or deflecting criticism because they seemingly want to stay on campus. We want to be on campus for the semseter if it was possible! People are just accepting the testing is grossly inadequate and are focusing instead on parties. This is like giving upon eliminating fossil fuels and focusing on recycling and turning off the lights to protect the environment. If you want to stay on campus you should be demanding BC put proper safety measures, including adequate testing in place. That means multiple tests in the week after students return and bi-weekly testing for everyone after that. You can't acknowledge 30-50k weekly tests are needed and then accept that BC is doing 1k, as if that's not consequential. Without proper testing and contract tracing, it doesn't matter if no student attends a single party in the next 4 months. Parties don't create the disease, they only help accelerate the spread of something that is already there and undetected. That's where testing everyone multiple times a week becomes important. If 50 people without the virus have a party, it's not going to spread. All of this focus on individual behavior and students being responsible for the success of staying on campus is letting BC off the hook for failing to act responsibly by putting proper protocols in place. This failure, not students, is what will lead to students being forced to leave campus.\n\nOther sources [https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/testing-covid-19-faq-1.5593840](https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/testing-covid-19-faq-1.5593840)\n\nYale study - everyone on campus should be tested every 2 days [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2768923](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2768923)",

Do they not realize that we have 70,000 new cases per DAY now, and soon we will have more than 100,000 cases per day, while at the end of March we had 68,000 case TOTAL. How can they even compare these two situations ?\n\n\nThe form to request online courses is in the comments.",

That's disgusting.\n\nI'm always so torn as a BC alum, because the kindness and warmth of the BC community as a whole is matched only by the cold callousness of the administration. It only manifest itself in small and relatively insignificant ways when I was a student (ultimately, lives weren't on the line when I was there), but I can't say I'm even slightly surprised about how they're handling this.",

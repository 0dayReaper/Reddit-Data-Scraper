I think that the class selection is pretty good, and I'm really satisfied with my choice to study English at BC. If you're interested in some of the courses offered in the English department, you can go to this link: [https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/english/undergrad/undergraduate-courses.html#](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/english/undergrad/undergraduate-courses.html#). Scroll down to where is says \"previous semesters\" and click \"electives\" :) Hope that helps!",

English is not a super popular major at BC, so I find that even when I get bad registration times, I can still manage to get into the courses I want. It's not like there are a bunch of empty seats once the semester starts, but overall it hasn't been bad!",

The classes are all taught by great faculty and the electives are some of the most interesting at BC. I am a double major so my experience may be different as I am not getting a job in the English field so i dont know how career support is.",

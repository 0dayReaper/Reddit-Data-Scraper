            "comment": "BC sucks tbh. There are a lotta commies here and woke people. If you take a history or philosophy class here, you will have to act woke to get an A. Also tons of sexists who think only men are pro life as well as racists who think only white people can be a conservative. The people here are toxically competitive to the point they wish for your demise academically, like don\u2019t think you can depend on peers here academically. Oh and people are rude here too and stuck up. They think too highly of themselves to say hi or talk to other people in classes. Hence why there exists the \u201cBC lookaway\u201d culture on campus. Lotta cliques. It\u2019s like most people never got out of the high school mindset. And to add the cherry on top the food sucks. You will get diarrhea eating the food here, and it\u2019s ridiculously overpriced and extremely small portions.",

    "postText": "Im a junior at Berkeley interning in Boston over the summer - I saw the LightView apartments and seemed interested in the living situation, especially since they roommate match you.\n\nI was wondering if there were any similar sublet options, maybe a co-op, self-op, or basically a slightly upscale place that will give me roommates and a cool social vibe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Hey! During orientation you should meet with an advisor who can help you with some of this. General rule of thumb is to take 1-2 intro classes for your major (for you this would be principles of Econ and/or CS1) and then a few core classes. Popular ones for freshmen are theology and philosophy since they are usually on the easier side, as well as first year writing seminar. You can also take perspectives which takes up two classes and is a combined Phil/theo core.  There is a template that they should give you at orientation but you can also find a lot of information by digging through the website.",

Sociology classes that allow you to get a social science and cultural diversity done in one class. Enduring Questions courses are a goldmine for this, and are only available to freshmen. Start your foreign language (if you need it) in freshman year.",

From what I\u2019ve seen the application process seems to lean a lot on gpa, so I was hoping to know if anyones gotten into programs with a low gpa/what programs might be best to try and apply for?",

            "comment": "My advice is to apply for programs that are not so popular. My GPA is a little bit higher than yours but since nobody wanted to go to Scotland, I got my first choice in the spring. Just realize that you might not be able to go to the popular programs like Madrid or London for the spring semester which are the most popular programs. Be open to going in the fall or different places that are not as popular. Also you can reach out to the office of global education if you any questions. They are really great with helping students study abroad since I had the same question as you.",

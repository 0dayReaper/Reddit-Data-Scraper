Why are they going to revoke my housing for the spring semester if I choose to stay home? Anyone else think this is crazy?",

If they allowed the people that want to stay home to stay home (whether it's if all 5 classes online, not comfortable coming back, etc) then they could de-densify the residence halls. If would be safer from a public health stand point. \n\nI'm really skeptical of the FAQ site where they say \" University anticipates having sufficient on-campus housing for its students\". Even in a regular semester, BC doesn't have enough housing for its students. Hence the triples and the overflowing into lounges on Newton campus. Now there are student from cancelled study abroad programs coming back too.",

Other students will have moved into their current rooms and if BC didn\u2019t put this policy in place it would create an even bigger issue because now where do those students who lived in there the first semester go? (BC would have time to prepare but I don\u2019t think they want to be moving kids around at all) I think people minds quickly (and justly) go towards money as the motive behind these decisions  but I think in this case this is the best option they have at this point.",

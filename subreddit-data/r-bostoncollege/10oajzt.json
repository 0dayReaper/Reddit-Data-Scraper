            "comment": "I was not a math major, but took some classes in the department specifically tailored to math majors. It seems very intense and high quality and graduates seem to do pretty well. Compared to other schools, BC has a much larger core, which might prevent you from taking as many math specific classes as other schools, but imo it more than makes up for it. A BS is around 60ish credits and a BA is around 30 credits if I remember correctly. BS Geological Sciences \u201821. Hope that helps!",

You\u2019d need to find courses that align with your applied math interests, both inside and outside of the math department. The math department itself, like someone else suggested, doesn\u2019t have a focus on applied topics, but there are a few professors doing applied research",

            "comment": "Recent BC math graduate here. So BC doesn\u2019t have an actual applied math major, but there are some \u201capplied math\u201d classes that are offered. These courses, though, are mainly statistics-focused. Before I graduated I spoke to Professor Cheung and he told me how he was trying to create a data science concentration within the math department. He teaches the more applied classes like math stats, time series, and complex variables (you can argue whether the latter is applied or not). There is also a stochastic processes course which is usually taught by Professor Wolf. \n\nHowever, stats is really just a subset of applied math. BC doesn\u2019t offer any courses in topics like numerical methods (BC has numerical analysis listed as a course, but they never offered it during my time there) and optimization which would be the core center of other applied math degrees. If that\u2019s where your interests lie, I wouldn\u2019t recommend going to BC.\n\nWith that said, I think BC\u2019s math department is really underrated. After graduating from their program, I am now a grad student in an applied math program at a great school and I would say that BC prepared me really well. The math courses are all pretty proof-focused (even the stats classes) which really heightens your understanding of the topics. You can also tailor the classes you take such that you are prepared for either grad school or industry. For example, one of my math friends is currently in grad school for statistics where he\u2019s writing a lot of papers and having great success and another is a quant at a big bank. \n\nI apologize this turned into an essay, my main point is: unless you have a keen interest in a specific applied math topic, I wouldn\u2019t get hung up on the distinction between pure math/applied math for an undergrad degree. The outcomes for both are more or less the same.",

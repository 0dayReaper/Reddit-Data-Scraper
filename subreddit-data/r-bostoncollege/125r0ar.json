I know sophomores cannot get parking permits on campus, but I wanted to know if there's anywhere I can park. There is cars behind welch hall it what seems to be in a big parking lot so I am also wondering what that is. Any help on my situation would be great, thanks.",

I ended up getting three in two weeks and got my car towed :(( I mean the $260 or whatever was worth parking for three years but just a heads up this could happen",

Your best bet is renting a spot from a junior living off campus, but that will mean your car would be pretty far from Welch. I had a friend who just carefully did street parking closer to Newton but again, not convenient and you risk parking tickets or getting towed.",

    "postText": "MSF student here. I have some background in data science from undergrad (where i also studied philosophy) and would hate to waste that skillset while studying finance hence this club. One of the professors teaching machine learning/business analytics has agreed to be the advisor of this club. I'm still trying to figure out the governance structure of this club as well as specific areas that we'll research.\n\nWhat i have in mind now is that we can conduct research on the drivers (HDI, inflation, GDP, import-export data, etc.) and nature of the global financial market (data mining and ML stuff), create and backtest trading strategies, optimize portfolios using ML, etc. A lot of finance stuff can be carried out via object-oriented programming, and i think it'll be fun also to use machine learning algorithms to discover patterns unseen by ordinary methods.\n\nI think the nature of this club should be highly interdisciplinary in that we'll need people from econ, history, international relations, poli sci, etc., to help us understand the qualitative aspect of the models and make sense of our discovery, if any. We'll also need people from areas like finance, stats, CS, and business analytics to apply and construct the necessary models using python/R/C++ (maybe mostly python). Though we'll probably need the rest of this semester and the winter break for preparation (building the governance structure might not be as important as building algorithms/functions that are crucial for systematizing what we'll be doing in the spring), my expectation is that by the end of the spring semester, we'll have something interesting to demonstrate to a large audience. And yes this club is all about collaborating with people from different disciplines, testing out intersting ideas, and delivering results.\n\nSo if you have unlimited curiosity and are interested, feel free to let me know, I plan to meet with people sometime next week (or after the break depending on how many people are interested) in Fulton.",

Just your overview in a few paragraphs demonstrates a knowledge and interest in the field. And this type of work while in school will make you incredibly marketable when you graduate. \n\nA suggestion: you\u2019re missing one of the most important aspects of fund management, IR (investor relations). This might be a good opportunity to get some of your liberal arts friends in the mix. Some would argue the hardest part of building a new fund isn\u2019t strategy or algo development, but raising money and interacting with LPs (Limited Partners). Even if you just simulate this part, I\u2019d recommend googling around what an IR team does and trolling linked in for MM (middle market) IR teams to get a feel for org structure, pitches, investor day materials, etc.  \n\nBest of luck!",

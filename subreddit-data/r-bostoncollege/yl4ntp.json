This morning I received the most devastating email a man can receive, that someone might be moving in. What are some things I can do to discourage this and potentially prevent this?? I have gotten to used to living alone I don't want this to happen. Any ideas please.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dwpqufck0rx91.png?width=2460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dc2383947fa8fbc90e8858fb4da86430e59c8bfb",

You were very lucky to have a single for a couple months, but you are still in a double and not entitled to keep living alone. Next year you can go live off campus alone if you want, but for now, don\u2019t be unnecessarily rude or disruptive. Living with a roommate is part of the college experience and you might as well grow up and learn how to live with someone else in the meantime.",

When did they let you know you were approved for return?

Act thuggish or unreasonable, nag them, and generally just be a bitch to them. This will leave a bad first impression so they decide not to room with you.\n\n3.

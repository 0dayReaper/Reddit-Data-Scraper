    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm applying to transfer to BC in my sophomore spring. I was wondering if anyone on this sub had any experiences with spring transfers to BC and if you could shed any light on the process. Any advice from anyone is also very much appreciated.\n\nEdit: Also I'm a little confused on the History Core requirements. I noticed it says that the historical range is 1500-Modern, but I've noticed BC core classes that cover ancient history. Have previous transfers gained credit for any history course outside of US history?",

            "comment": "I transferred in the fall of this year (fall 2021) and at first I had a really hard time. I lived on campus in the fall but my living situation was rough so I moved off-campus and my experience was so much better.  BC can be a very tradition-oriented school (not everyone and not as much as Notre Dame for example) but your college experience is whatever you make it and having a more untraditional one is not bad. Realizing that really helped me. I also didn't get into any of the clubs I wanted to join and that was discouraging but I ended up getting amazing internships and making friends other ways. The transfer community is great.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, regarding the history core, US history doesn't count for core, but there are a number of history courses that fill the requirement that go from a range of time periods and you have a lot of choices about what you want to take.",

            "comment": "Can\u2019t speak much to the transfer experience, but there\u2019s two parts to the history core requirements. The History 2 cores tend to be from the century or a little earlier, while the history 1 cores tend to go back much further. There\u2019s also a lot of courses which cover ancient history but don\u2019t count for history core; I know there\u2019s some art cores like that as well as some major-specific classes",

If you have any questions feel free to PM me, although some of your questions may be better answered by an email to the admissions office",

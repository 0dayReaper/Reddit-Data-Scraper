You may want to ask the Conte ticket office for help on this! \n\nThis is how it worked 2015-2018 as an undergrad (do not quote me on it still being like this\u2026)\n- throughout the fall you earn gold pass points for going to football and hockey games and such\n- earning a certain amount gets you in the Beanpot priority lane, especially\n- we had to show up to Conte to buy tickets as a group I think 1-2 weeks before the first game\n- then you sit anywhere in the BC section at TD Garden. No one honors the seat assignments because people want to sit with their friends and it\u2019s hard for all the friends to find a time to go to Conte together.",

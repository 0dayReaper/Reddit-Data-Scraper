Would love to hear more about peoples\u2019 current/past neuroscience major experience. \n\nFrom the little that I can judge, BCs neuroscience major is intertwined with the psychology program so does that limit amount of neuroscience specific courses/ability to concentrate mainly on neuro? Also how is the difficulty in participating in undergrad neuro research on campus? Any and all info helps:)",

All of the professors, in my experience, are so eager to teach and all of the upper level classes I took were amazing and really set me up with good skills for my job post-grad.\n\nIf you are pre-med, the neuro track is a great way to satisfy pre-med requirements (tons of overlap). There are obviously many differences between BC and BU and at the end of the day choose which ever best fits your situation :) happy to talk more about it if you have any Qs.",

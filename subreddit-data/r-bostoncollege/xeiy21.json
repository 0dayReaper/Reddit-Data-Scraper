Is it horrible? or should I be pleasantly surprised. I have low expectations. Any information would be appreciated!",

Especially if your parents own a house, BC expects parents to re-mortgage to take out a home equity loan on a home to pay for college. At least they did when I was there (which was admittedly a long time ago).",

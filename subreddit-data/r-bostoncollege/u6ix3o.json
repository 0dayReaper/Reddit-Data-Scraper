Should I expect to hear more info from BC on this, or am I on my own?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the off campus housing website guys, looks like that will work pretty well",

I would start there",

Found a nice house on Lake street very close to campus that was only for grad and law students, I\u2019d recommend it if there was a common living space. I was able to find a few places to check out in a short time through this resource.",

I used it when I was searching for a place for my Junior year, and there are graduate students who also use it to find roommates. Not sure you will have access because you were just admitted (congratulations by the way!), but I hope it helps.",

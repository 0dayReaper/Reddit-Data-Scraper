    "postText": "On Wednesday, March 8th it was announced that Mount Alvernia High School in Newton (across the street from BC's Newton campus) would be closing its doors at the end of the school year. The reason for its closure was the unilateral decision by the Missionary Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception who own the property at 790 Center St to sell the land. This decision was made with no participation of the Mount Alvernia board and without their knowledge. The buyer of the property is undisclosed but is now widely known to be Boston College. \n\nIn 2006 Boston College stepped up and saved the Saint Columbkille School in Brighton forming the Saint Columbkille Partnership School and creating a model for Catholic early childhood, elementary, and middle school education. Today their actions are directly resulting in the closure of one of the few remaining all-girl high schools in the region. \n\nIn BC's quest to expand they are forcing a thriving almost 100-year-old institution to close its doors. Their actions along with the Missionary Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception are forcing 150 girls into a new school, juniors who were planning on entering their senior year of high school next year are now being forced to do so at an unfamiliar school. Students whose mothers and grandmothers attended Mount Alvernia High School are now going to be the last of their family to do so, friend groups are being torn apart and traditions destroyed. \n\nIt doesn't have to be like this, BC has the power to save Mount Alvernia High School. They can again choose to save Catholic education in the region, or they can be a contributor to its downfall. \n\nStudents and alumni of BC help us save Mount Alvernia High School and women's education by telling President Leahy and BC's board that the cost of their endless quest to expand is too great.",

BC isn\u2019t putting the school out of business and the idea that they\u2019re a contributor to its downfall is absolutely absurd. \n\nIf BC doesn\u2019t buy it, someone else will.",

                    "comment": "The sisters are the main culprits here, they made the decision to sell the property knowing full well this would result in the school\u2019s closure. They made this decision last year and never notified the schools board of their intentions, and the cherry on top is that two sisters are on the board. Furthermore they rejected a matching counteroffer that would have kept the school open. \n\nNow that the decision has been made and the school is powerless to stop it the ball is in BC\u2019s court. They have the power and resources to keep the school open; they have no immediate need for the land and the school wouldn\u2019t require any support from BC to remain open; unlike other Catholic schools that have recently closed Mount Alvernia is financially solvent. The only reason they are closing is because of the backhanded deal to sell the property. \n\nBC\u2019s endless quest to expand doesn\u2019t justify their actions. If they want to purchase the land that\u2019s fine, but they should give the school the opportunity to remain open, and when the time comes to develop the land they should relocate the school. BC states that they are grounded in the ideals that inspired our Jesuit founders; can you honestly say that those ideals include making a secret deal to purchase land and close a thriving Catholic high school?",

It sounds like the situation was unsustainable. I don't think any Catholic school with only 150 students in grades 7 - 12 ( an average of 25 students per grade) can support itself.\u00a0\n\nI do feel for the students involved and hope they transition easily and successfully to their next schools, but I believe having a Catholic institution like BC buy the property is probably the best outcome, at least it will remain associated with Catholic education.",

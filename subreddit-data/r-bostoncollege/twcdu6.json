    "postText": "I'm thinking about taking Investments with Robert James and Corporate Finance with Aimee Smith (both online async) in the second summer session this summer. I want to take some Finance electives next year and these classes are prerequisites.\n\nI know the format will be different from in-person, full-semester classes (and the pace will be twice as fast) but I just want to see if it's even realistic or if the speed and amount of work would just be too much.\n\nAnother option is taking one of the Finance classes and Marketing in the summer session. Any advice on choosing between Peter Nunziata or Xanthe Samaras for Marketing?\n\nIt would be great to hear from anyone who has taken these classes/professors in person or if you took them online in the summer.\n\nThanks much!",

I would say that it was not that bad in terms of work, but not sure how my experience translates to a condensed summer session for an async class. Can't comment on professors as I never took any of them and never took marketing either.",

I saw that you posted a question about taking either Entrepreneurial Finance or Venture Captial a while back and now I'm looking at making that choice and possibly taking Entrepreneurial Finance with Andrew Hession-Kunz in the fall. Did you end up taking either class? If so, would you recommend?",

EF was pretty easy, it was just quizzes that don't really count for a lot, a company modeling project (he gives you a template, it's pretty easy don't worry it's not hardcore financial modeling), and a final that he gives because he says the department requires it (eg. it was quite easy). The classes are really just him lecturing and talking about startups and startups trends, very little math and what math there was is basic math. Also you do a project with the VC class where you pitch them the company you have modeled out and they decide whether to invest or not. I talked to my partner from the VC class and they said that the VC class was chill too.",

Corporate Finance wasn't too bad as long as you keep up with the lectures and set up/solve all of the problems from the lectures in a well-formatted excel spreadsheet. You can use spreadsheets for the exams so knowing how to solve the problems in excel makes a huge difference. Message me if you want the syllabus. If you could take one class in each summer session I think it would be fine but both together would be a good amount of work.",

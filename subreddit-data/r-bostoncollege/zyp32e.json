            "comment": "I just took Comparative Revolutions with him this past semester, and I think the course structure is at least somewhat similar to his globalization class so I think this should help. In total I don\u2019t think the workload was terrible - as you noted, there\u2019s basically no busywork, it\u2019s just a couple huge assignments. It really depended on the week.\n\nThe research project was no joke at all. At least in my course, you had to pick your topic over a month before it was due, and this was legitimately an assignment where if you didn\u2019t start working at least 2 weeks in advance you would be in big trouble. It was legitimately probably the hardest I have ever worked on an assignment, my total project came out to like 17 pages including citations. With that said, it wasn\u2019t *that* difficult \u2014 the actual content was pretty easy to understand and write about \u2014 but it was just an incredible amount of effort.\n\nThe take home essays were a lot tamer, basically what you\u2019d expect from like an upper level Polisci class. The first one was like 8 pages and the final exam was 2 different essays that combined for 10 pages. While he\u2019s certainly not the type of professor to give everyone an A, he is also a pretty easy grader in my experience. Like a 6-7/10 easiness.\n\nLectures are interesting, although I thought the content in my course was a bit too niche for my tastes. He is a good lecturer and it\u2019s extremely obvious that he\u2019s a crazy smart and knowledgeable guy. He also knows an insane amount about Russia-Ukraine (it is like his speciality) which I believe the globalization class will touch on a lot. He\u2019s also a really nice guy outside of class and is not an asshole at all about like extensions etc.\n\nOverall I\u2019d recommend! He\u2019s a solid prof. But just\u2026 watch out for that research project.",

I honestly don't remember how much time I spent on the exams or research paper, but I remember feeling like the workload was reasonable even with my full course load, part-time job, and volunteering. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful with regard to your actual question, however, I really recommend taking a course with Christiansen. He was literally one of my favorite professors.",

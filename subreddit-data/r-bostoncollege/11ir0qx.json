    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI recently was accepted in a master\u2019s at BC, and I was wondering if someone could talk about approximately how much they pay for housing and utilities. I noticed that BC\u2019s estimated costs of living were actually much lower than another school I\u2019ve been accepted to in Tennessee, which made me a little confused about their cost breakdown, given that Boston is notoriously expensive.\n\nThanks!",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the UGBC elections and now impeachment coming up, I have seen a lot of talk about the role of UGBC on campus. Even tonight on Reddit, people are trying to make a mockery of what I believe to be an integral institution at Boston College. Over my time here, UGBC has passed countless resolutions that were sent to BC administration to do nothing with. They have created many social media posts with information that no one reads or even cares about. They have hosted elections that barely anyone votes in. They have spent years pandering to the student body by making unattainable goals that they wouldn't have the power to enact if they even cared enough to try.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUGBC is the furthest thing from a useless group of kids who miss their student government class in high school a little too much, which is why it needs to be protected at all costs. I hope that the BC community can be respectful and supportive going forward.",

As I said, I'm a PhD student--I'm uninformed on the issue because I'm thirty years old and don't know any undergrads aside from the few I interact with on a purely professional basis. Other social media has been quiet about it, so I'm not sure how I was expected to have this insight.\n\nI understand that it's very frustrating to have a student government that is supposed to fight for your needs but isn't accomplishing anything. I also now understand the money concern. It's actually very normal for student government to get a lot of money--this was also the case at my undergrad institution. However, at that institution, the admin *wanted* to know what students wanted and needed, and the SG's job was to communicate and facilitate those things. We frequently saw the products of that money in the form of necessary community improvements and popular campus life events. From my experience, this is the case at many private colleges.\n\nI say this because the point of my original comment was that **the level of blatant disregard that the administration shows for the BC community's needs--and towards its community representatives--is not normal.**\n\nThis has been a problem for decades, and undergrads are not the only ones experiencing it. For example, I know that the people who run the grad school union work extremely hard, but the admin refuses to meet with union leaders or even acknowledge that the union exists. This is very frustrating, especially when issues like insurance coverage are on the line. However, our anger is directed at the admin\u2014the ones who are refusing to listen in the first place. (I also would not accuse you of being \"oblivious\" to an issue that concerns your TAs and student professors, since there\u2019s no reason for you to have that information.)\n\nI obviously can\u2019t speak for anything specific that UGBC does or doesn\u2019t do. However, if grad student and faculty collectives can\u2019t even get the admin to agree to professional quality-of-life changes\u2014even under threat of dramatic mass action\u2014I\u2019m not sure what can be expected from a group of undergrads.\n\nI will say that the admin often acts with one goal in mind: to keep money flowing in from alumni, and to some extent, parents as well. It\u2019s possible that if undergrads were to communicate with parents and alumni about the administration\u2019s behavior on a wide scale (especially regarding, say, the COVID issue), that might force their hand\u2014but I don\u2019t know.\n\nThat's my perspective on the matter, which I hope is useful to someone. If there is another aspect of the situation that I'm missing, I would appreciate if you would inform me. (I would prefer insightful information instead of personal attacks or non-sequiturs about my self-care habits--despite the fact that those seem very popular.) Also, if there is another social media platform or a particular hashtag that students are using to talk about these issues, then knowing about that would also give non-undergrads a resource to help us understand what\u2019s going on.\n\nAnd finally, just a **PSA: if there is something that you're angry or frustrated by, please share with a faculty member you trust. It's unprofessional to ask students about \"campus drama,\" but many of us will listen carefully if you bring it up.**",

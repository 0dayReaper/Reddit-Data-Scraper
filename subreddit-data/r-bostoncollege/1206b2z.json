It starts at $3000/semester and counts down. You\u2019re not limited to a certain number of swipes or anything. You typically don\u2019t get that money back if it goes unused but I think it rolls over from fall to spring. I, as an 18 year old female in 2014-15, ate 3 meals a day and still didn\u2019t get close to finishing up that amount and at the end of freshman year, was literally buying Powerade by the CASE to use up the funds. Some days you won\u2019t even go to the dining hall since you\u2019ll be downtown or even visiting home for a weekend. \n\nSome of the food is actually really good but it can be repetitive. There are a lot of options and it rotates. Sometimes there will be special themed nights. This week\u2019s menus are here: https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/offices/auxiliary-services/sites/dining/locations/dining-menus.html (it\u2019s only showing Hillside for now but hopefully they\u2019ll fix that?)",

If your dorm has a kitchen then meal plan is optional but if it is not then it is mandatory. For example, if you end up in 2k (2000 commonwealth avenue) as a sophomore (possible by applying to the healthy living LLC), which has a kitchen, then you could avoid the mandatory meal plan. On the other hand, if you are in Steyer as a junior and do not have a kitchen, then you are still required to go meal plan.",

There were some \u201cspecial\u201d nights where they would bring in outside caterers and it would be an incredible meal but thats like 2x a year. During covid it got to a point where parents were getting involved with the school because the food quality got so bad. BC Dining is *technically* its own entity from BC so they get the excuse of \u201cwere operating at a loss already\u201d and they pay rent to BC which makes no sense really. \n\nI would assume they got better post covid so I\u2019d say its alright, there are certainly worse dining halls at other colleges but if you go out to UMass Amherst for example you\u2019ll see how good college food could be, especially for the tuition BC charges.\n\nAlso, as others have mentioned; the most frustrating part is the a la carte pricing they use which not only makes the food crazy expensive, you have to wait in checkout lines which just makes the process take forever. \n\nIf the meal plan wasn\u2019t mandatory for those without a kitchen you could make that $3k go further just eating out and save money doing it. Thats pretty much what my friends and I did senior year when we moved back to campus.",

My sons meals routinely end up costing $20-30 for not a ton of food and we always have to add more money by end of semester.  He has shown us photos of his meals and told us what they cost and ir is always shocking.  His guy friends at least experience the same thing and there are always a lot of parents online complaining about it.  BC claims that the meal plan is cheaper or about the same as other schools but the thing is that you don\u2019t get nearly as much food for your money.  He loves BC but truthfully the meal plan is the worst thing about the school.",

My freshman year the food was pretty decent, I would say Stu food was actually very good some nights, but i can\u2019t say how that is these days.

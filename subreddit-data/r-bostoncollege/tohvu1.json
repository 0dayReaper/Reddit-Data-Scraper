            "comment": "I believe what happens is that they calculate what the cost should be for living off-campus and give you financial aid based on that. The problems are that you don\u2019t get financial aid for any summer months your lease includes (which makes affording rent unrealistic for many of us in Montserrat) and that their calculation might assume your rent is less than what it actually turns out to be. But I\u2019d talk to your financial aid advisor for a more definitive answer on that.\n\n 2K is on-campus housing. The apartment-style housing is more expensive than suites, and the highest flex plan should be enough for one meal a day most days for a semester (source: I\u2019m in 2K and got BC to cover the highest flex plan for me lol)",

            "comment": "2k is considered on-campus housing and is a pretty popular place for juniors who have all 4 years. If you do live there they have full kitchens so you hypothetically wouldn\u2019t need a meal plan at all. You can find the cost per semester for both on the housing website &amp; then factor in cost of meal plan for lower and cost of monthly food for 2k.",

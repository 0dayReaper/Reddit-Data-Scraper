    "postText": "Question; I have two more classes I am taking in the summer to wrap up my MSF. So my graduation is Summer 2023. Do you still get to walk in the spring? I know that might sound silly but that was done at my college for undergrad, so I was wondering if anyone has been in the same position as me. Thanks!",

    "postText": "Hey all!\n\nLong-time sub member and current prime mod /u/forty_three here (class of '12)! Many of you may have seen the drama around the upcoming Reddit blackout that many subreddits are participating in, which starts June 12th. In summary: reddit is changing its policy in ways that will prevent 3rd party apps from being viable. If you want to learn more, check out /r/Save3rdPartyApps or read through [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/).\n\n**How does that affect you?** I dunno. But it affects *me* (I primarily use 3rd party apps to access the site, and am not gonna migrate to the regular website, so I'll pretty much be gone from the site after July 1st) - and I'm one of the few still-active mods on this subreddit. But I don't want to abandon my BC peeps without warning. &lt;3  \n  \n**Will /r/bostoncollege be participating in the blackout?** No. But only because I'm lazy and don't want to deal with figuring out how to actually make that happen.  \n    \nSo, I'm putting out a call for new volunteers to moderate this sub.  \n  \n**What does moderating mean?**  \n  \nThe expectations are pretty light - respond to modmail, report and remove spam, deal with uncivil comments, occasionally lock things down when salty BU students brigade us (I'm joking about it being BU, but - like all subreddits - we do occasionally get lightly brigaded by trolls, maybe once every year or two).  \n  \nIf you're really passionate, you might want to update the community rules, change the subreddit settings, or try to attract more people from the BC community to join this forum.  \n  \n---  \n  \nI'm perfectly aware that this is a pretty quiet community, and has mainly become a place for people to ask for class recommendations (which I personally still think is extremely silly, because it's like... the _least_ efficient way of getting that info, haha - it's probably more effective to just scream your class rec questions out in the middle of ONeill Plaza - but people seem committed to giving it a shot here, which is harmless enough).  \n  \nThe good thing about that is it means there's not much moderating to do. The bad thing is that, with one fewer mod, it means that spam traffic could pretty quickly overtake legitimate community discussions.  \n  \n---\n  \n**How do I join?**  \n  \nIf you're willing to help us out, or have other questions, [message us through this form](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fbostoncollege&amp;subject=[modapplication]&amp;message=). Users with generally civil comment history &amp; past BC subreddit engagement will have priority. Thanks!",

That said, most of the other major Boston schools have frats of some sort. The people I know who went to some tended to go to Northeastern or BU, since they were closer, but others went to MIT or sometimes Harvard, though those were a little more selective.\n\nHonestly, unless you absolutely need a frat environment/parties 24/7, you can probably find what you\u2019re looking for on-campus in the right groups and clubs. BC may not be a massive party school but there\u2019s still plenty going on usually. This can vastly depend on who you know though.",

In other schools it's more like a social club.\n\nLike many others, no Greek life was a 'pro' for me (coming from the South), and BC has so many student organizations &amp; clubs that there's ample opportunity to socialize with people outside of classes.  And no Greek life doesn't mean no parties... yeah B.C isn't as much of a \"party school\" as others, but it's not a dry campus.",

I think social life at bc is lacking with few bars, small parties, and cops and an administration that is pretty strict. You can go to other parties in the city, for instance MIT, but that\u2019s for younger grades. Overall I would tell you that if a major party scene is important to you that you should not consider BC. The same could be said about most of the private northeast schools. It\u2019s just about trade offs and if you think that a lack of massive parties is more important than the other benefits BC gives you.",

I don\u2019t think greek life is inherently toxic, certain people are toxic. - I loved being in a fraternity, but the camaraderie at BC is not lacking at all. Tailgating games is fun, if you play a club sport that social situation behaves similar to a frat, and senior year living in the mods is similar to being in a frat too. Albeit just for one year. - In conclusion I highly recommend greek life but it also doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s missing at BC.",

I tried to go off the university requirements but was confused about a few things. \n\nSample Schedule: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rxUqJSWqk7ZFc5bdxo0I9wkApcf0-yJ-Jmtsu-cfaWM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rxUqJSWqk7ZFc5bdxo0I9wkApcf0-yJ-Jmtsu-cfaWM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nQuestions:\n\n* Does AP Statistics exempt me from the Business Statistics requirement or do I still have to take Statistical Computing with R?\n* Can Hist 1617 \"Making the Modern World\" fulfill cultural diversity and the second history requirement?\n\nThanks!",

Classes change, get dropped from the listings, are only offered in fall or spring, and then sometimes super cool new classes pop up that you\u2019ll want to take! So don\u2019t be afraid to be flexible.\n\nAlso want to note that while there is no core requirement for a language class, you do have to demonstrate intermediate-level proficiency in a language before you graduate. If you can\u2019t test-out of your chosen language before starting at BC, you\u2019ll have to take language classes up through Intermediate II (but you can jump in and skip the beginner classes if you\u2019re proficient enough)",

            "comment": "For AP Statistics if you look at the AP Policy Website ([https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/admission/sites/advanced-placement.html](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/admission/sites/advanced-placement.html)) it says if you get a 5 it fulfills Business Statistics Requirement for CSOM students beginning with Class of 2024.\n\nFor the History Course, if it says online that it fulfills both history and CD then yes it will count for your second history requirement.\n\nOne important note is that the History Course you selected is for first-year students only - generally speaking, the registrar switches around what core courses that are offered each semester. Since you are wanting to take that your Senior year there is a high chance that the exact course won't be offered. This is the same with some other courses in your major, some are only offered spring or fall (not both).  Instead, I would make things more general - for example, I would just plan to take a history course that also fulfills a CD requirement (there are usually quite a few).\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions - PM me!",

I don't recommend taking logic and randomness in two different years. Overall, I agree with previous comments that getting into logic as a freshman and algorithms as a soph is a bit of an unrealistic plan.",

In addition, it\u2019s 6 credits, as you must take both the Science and History portions. If there is a section available to you next year in either semester, it\u2019s a pretty decent class to get through half of your science and history cores, but I definitely wouldn\u2019t plan on being able to take it unless you see it as an option.",

Additionally, you are able to skip 2 CSOM core classes by doing a double major through MCAS (such as CS), but you\u2019re limited as to which courses you can skip. You\u2019ll be able to check which ones you can through your degree audit once you get here but AFAIK all the core courses up to Coding for Business can\u2019t be skipped.",

I\u2019d definitely email to confirm if I were you, but regardless, if you have those or any other qualifying AP social science scores it\u2019ll at least fulfill the other part of your social science core alongside Principles of Econ. Also, assuming you do end up taking Econ, I highly recommend taking it with Professor Erbil, he\u2019s one of if not the best Professor I\u2019ve had so far here.",

I wanted to know current student's opinions on BC's science programs because I have heard a lot about their Humanities programs online but nothing about the sciences, specifically Physics.\n\nAny current student who could share their opinion and expireince of majoring in a STEM field at BC would sincerely help me.\n\nThank You!",

            "comment": "Im a CS major so my courses are probably less math intensive than yours would be but in my general experience the programs are up to standard. They\u2019re definitely not as acclaimed as the liberal arts and businesses departments but BC\u2019s been putting an emphasis on the sciences recently. They just built a new integrated science building which is hella nice and are starting to experiment with new engineering programs. For me I feel like as time has gone on my profs have gotten better and more experienced. Some of my teachers my first year were kinda shit because they\u2019ll use some new guy or a traveling professor for a class like Calc 1 but when the classes get more specific you can tell profs are more experienced. On the physics stuff I have a few friends who major in AP and Im pretty sure it\u2019s hard but the profs are ok. The worst part about being a STEM major here is the fact that you\u2019re still in MCAS so you have a shit ton of core so you have to take like 4 semesters of Spanish but it\u2019s a pretty minor detail I guess. That\u2019s all I got good luck",

            "comment": "I went to Emory for undergrad and am at BC for a grad program. I loved my undergraduate experience at Emory. The student body is more diverse (racially, socioeconomically, religiously) than BC\u2019s undergraduate student body. Atlanta was a super fun city to be a college student in (the nightlife scene was nuts), but it\u2019s also not purely a college town like much of Boston can feel like. Both schools are set relatively far out from the city cores. Emory\u2019s campus is bigger and they have more graduate programs than BC (a med school, public health school, large healthcare system, long-standing relationship with the CDC etc) but BC has a football team. (If you care about things like that.) Boston has a better public transit system than Atlanta, but Atlanta is a much cheaper place to live (food, drinks, housing - you name it, it\u2019s probably cheaper.) I can\u2019t really speak to the undergraduate experience at BC, but the undergrads I interact with mostly seem to enjoy BC.",

            "comment": "Current sophomore here,\n\nClass registration: having registered for my classes literally today, the system is fucked. Way too much demand, not enough supply. If you get a bad pick time you\u2019re fucked. Classes will show open seats only for them to be \u201creserved for special populations\u201d. Or every single section will be full for required core classes. Usually the departments figure it out eventually, but this happens every single registration period. \n\nHousing: Not enough residences, almost every bedroom is at least a double. Hope you like sharing a bedroom with someone else all 4 years unless you live off campus as a junior. Vast majority get 3 years, I was one of the \u201clucky\u201d to get 4. Most of the buildings are mid. If you\u2019re expecting luxury accommodations looks elsewhere. \n\nFood: the dining halls aren\u2019t terrible per say, but they\u2019re extremely overpriced for what they are. Selection can also be awful at times, by which I mean BC makes some wack ass food that it seems like no one really eats but they insist on making it anyway. \n\nSocial scene: BC can be really cliquey at times. Freshman year is kinda rough socially, although things drastically improve as you get older and meet more people. Almost everyone here is chill. \n\nThese are the top things I \u201chate\u201d about this school, but in the grand scheme of things they shouldn\u2019t be dealbreakers. BC is an awesome place and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be happier anywhere else. I chose it over Emory BTW. Feel free to ask me any questions",

            "comment": "graduated 2 years ago. almost certain that these things mentioned below are still valid\n\n1. food is not bad, but good food is sparsely available in limited time windows while bad food is available all the time. for example flank steak sandwiches, which are actually pretty good, are only available a couple times a semester, whereas the regular dry ass burgers at lower are available 24/7. the price is also horrendous. the a la carte system means that you pay like you're paying at a restaurant (per item) rather than at a school cafeteria. if you're a big eater like me, good luck with getting overcharged. if you don't eat a lot, good luck with not getting any of your money back at the end of the year since meal plan money is nonrefundable. if you live on campus in a dorm that doesn't have a kitchen, the dining plan purchase is mandatory, which makes this whole thing even worse. most colleges across the country all work on a per swipe basis, so you can just eat as much as you want without any issue. bc is not one of those schools. ALSO, some places such as the chocolate bar or hillside cafe don't take dining bucks, but only takes eagle bucks, which is basically another dining/miscellaneous account that is completely separate from your dining money. everything about this just points to the fact that the school is trying to squeeze money out of its students. The prices of the already overpriced foods gets worse over time too. I distinctly remembering the pizzas getting more expensive and smaller in portion at my time at bc. this point might not be as valid for you if your full ride includes food money\n2. as digbick mentioned, class registration absolutely sucks balls. if you get a bad-pick time its game over. many classes are offered only during specific times of the year, and some classes don't have more than one prof teaching, so good luck trying to fit your schedule around classes you actually give half a shit about.\n3. most clubs don't have any real funding. i can't tell you the amount of times i went to club events that hooked me in with the promise of free food only to find out that there wasn't enough to feed half a basketball team.\n4. social scene. let me tell you. most bc kids come off the same assembly line. they're in csom (the business school) studying finance or econ, has parents in business, from a rich family, white, male, and only find enjoyment in drinking low quality beer and talking about football and how many girls they banged over the weekend. Its ridiculously cliquey, and i personally found very little in common with the vast majority of people at the school outside of those who are in clubs related to niche hobbies.\n5. location. bc advertises that it is super close to the city, but its not close at all. the fastest way to the city is via the school shuttle to the reservoir stop, whereby you take the T into the city. if you're lucky, a one way trip would be 30 min. if not, it can take up to an hour. its just enough of an inconvenience that you're not gonna end up going anywhere. at least that was the case for me. most times, there was just no reason to go all the way into the city when you knew that you'd waste 1-2 hours just on transportation. the T doesn't come on time in accordance to their schedule either, so its a straight up dice roll whether you get to where you want to go in time or not.\n6. dorms. dorms are bad. for most freshman dorms, you don't get AC. you're pretty much guaranteed to end up with roommates no matter where you live (with a few exceptions which i won't mention for simplicity sake). You also pay based on which building you live in, not how many roommates you have. I lived on a corner room in vandy during my second year, and i lived in a forced triple but had to pay the same price as those living in doubles. the chance of you getting completely fucked over like i did is minimal, but keep in mind that its a total possibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbc can be a good experience for the right person. however, i figured that you should at least know the main drawbacks to going there.",

                            "comment": "It depends on a couple of factors, such as how much stuff your roommates have, how agreeable they are, and whether they like staying in the room to studying vs going out to somewhere else. Some other considerations include whether they snore, how often they plan on bringing other people over, etc.\n\nIn terms of physical space, it's not the worst thing in the world to have a forced triple. However, i would preface to say that living in Newton isn't as bad of an outcome as you may think. The shuttle comes on a schedule, but the actual time it takes to go from newton to the main campus is pretty fast, like 10 min. This is not to mention that many Newton kids have told me that living on Newton campus has made them extremely close with other Newton kids due to how small the community is and all the time chatting on the shuttle/waiting at bus stops. \n\nUpper doesn't have a social environment like that, and as the name implies, it's located up from middle campus, meaning you have to climb some stairs and walk some serious inclines to get back to your dorm.",

I have found a bug in my food before and I've had some really questionable meals. It's also closed at weird times when you need it.  I have an early morning Sunday commitment and I can't get food here before 9 so I can't get food at all until I get back in the afternoon. From 2:30-4:00 for the upper campus dining hall you can technically get food but nothing substantial or what you want to eat, and from 4-4:30 it's completely closed.\n\nThat said, I love this school and I would take the trade-off again given the choice! In my experience, the dorms are fine, professors are amazing, and our facilities like academic halls, the gym, etc. are really great. BC is also very well connected, especially if you are planning on staying in Boston.",

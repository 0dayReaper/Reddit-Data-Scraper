    "postText": "UNC has had their 4th cluster in a week and they have yet to start classes. \n\n[https://www.cbs17.com/news/local-news/orange-county-news/4th-unc-chapel-hill-covid-19-cluster-detected-at-residence-hall/](https://www.cbs17.com/news/local-news/orange-county-news/4th-unc-chapel-hill-covid-19-cluster-detected-at-residence-hall/)\n\nNotre-Dame isn't looking to good either. \n\nA very large part of if this is gonna work or not is if the students are responsible. Which is sad because college age kids are fucking stupid, last year in my dorm hall kids would break the ceiling tiles every weekend and one time they even broke the glass display. And when BC announced that they were going online in the fall someone broke the gasson hall glass. I've seen kids puke on themselves. A couple of freshman smeared shit all over a bathroom last year too. So you gotta realize that BC like most schools has a lot of idiots who could ruin it for everyone. \n\nLook at this vid of kids at UNC.  I wont be surprised if something like that happens with BC kids . \n\n[https://twitter.com/laylaanna\\_/status/1294475482684153856](https://twitter.com/laylaanna_/status/1294475482684153856)\n\nBC has to send kids home if they aren't following the rules. (One guess per person in a dorm allowed)\n\nAnd if they are partying they should be expelled.",

Not gonna happen, and not what they\u2019re paying to be there for. \n\n99.99% of these kids fantasized about *this part*, the part in that UNC video, all through high school, not classes and studying and preparing for a successful career. That\u2019s a big part of the reason you can get stars in their eyes big enough to hoodwink some of them into signing up for 30 year indentured servitude to attend.",

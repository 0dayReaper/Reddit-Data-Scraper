    "postText": "Alright so I build the number you can send requests to about the dining hall.\n\nGot the mf running in the cloud and everything which is free.\n\nThere are some parts that do cost money, should I ask BC if they want to sponsor it or something? Idk if they will but like what do people think?\n\nAlso these are the dining hall names accepted including the BC slang ones so like lmk if you guys think im missing any. These are just what you'd have to type in to ask for a specific dining hall.\n\nmac, mcellroy, carney, after dark, kevork, bean counter, chocolate, bar, coro, eagles, nest, hillside, addies, legal grounds, lower, corcoran, rat, stu, the market, tully, tullies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: you can also ask for a specific meal like:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/namax5c0tsh91.png?width=1144&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=03d11a4f6f3e2becc87eff4116401f7297e92ef5\n\nedit 2: just fixed that dumb $amp; thing that you get in some of the meal categories",

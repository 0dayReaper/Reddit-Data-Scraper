            "comment": "Hey! Thought I would comment as a Neuro Major myself. Lamo is really great and friendly as a professor and lecturer, his notes are easy to follow and look back on. His tests shouldn't have any really big surprises as long as you keep up with all the lectures and readings, they're only tough if you slacked off on them.\n\nMacdannald was a great behavioral neuro professor, and the class was pretty easy. There's a few quizzes but they're all open book, and the 2 course projects you get plenty of time to do. The only thing is he told me he was going on a sabbatical next year, so I don't actually know if he's teaching next year. (Someone correct me if they know otherwise)",

            "comment": "Lamoureux and MacDannald are amazing professors.\n\nI took MacDannald's Behavioral Neuroscience class and it was great. Last term, there were 10 quizzes and 2 course projects. Quizzes were specific to the module and had about 10-20 questions. The number of questions depended on how much the module covered. The course projects challenged you to apply your knowledge by detailing the neuronal processes that would be happening in a given situation. i.e. Picking up a spoon full of aromatic broth. What needs to happen for us to pick up the spoon? What does the olfactory system do so that we can smell the broth?   \nThe class was interesting, not too much work, supportive, and grading was fast.",

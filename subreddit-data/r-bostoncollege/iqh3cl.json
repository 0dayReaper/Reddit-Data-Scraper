    "postText": "A couple days ago, someone posted a thread saying that someone on the 6th floor of Vanderslice Hall tested positive for COVID, and the university has *still* not informed other residents on that floor, including myself. Well, low and behold, a friend of mine just informed me that the other seven people in that person's 8-person dorm have tested positive as well. Now my entire 8-man, who lives on the same half of the hall as the infected dorm, has been \"randomly\" selected for testing tomorrow. Isn't that a striking coincidence?\n\nThe fact that the school hasn't told any of us Vandy residents is ridiculous on its own. But here's the worst part: last night, Vandy had a fire drill in which all six stories of the building evacuated through a single enclosed staircase. The entirety of that infected dorm's residents left their in-room quarantine and filed out, making no effort to distance themselves from the other students despite knowing the risks. I find it at best disappointing and, at worst, absolutely sickening that Boston College went through with a fire drill with the knowledge that an 8-person suite was supposed to stay isolated for fourteen days, *and* made no effort to inform other residents or discourage the infected dorm from taking part in the fire drill.\n\nCan we all stop pretending like the university is keeping this under control? At this point, their failure to enforce their own COVID policies is posing a risk to healthy students. It's nothing short of negligence, and I don't trust that to change any time soon.",

If students test positive, they are not supposed to be \"quarantining in their dorm\", they are supposed to be sent to isolation at a separate location. Are you sure they didn't test negative, but were quarantining because their roommate tested positive? Once someone tests positive they are supposed to be moved out of the dorms for 14 days.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nSo long story short, I was wondering if there are any transfer students here who wouldn't mind giving me some advice. I am looking into transferring to BC my sophomore year. I have a great essay and ECs, but my high school transcript is mediocre and I withdrew from two classes in the fall semester. I should have at least a 3.8 this semester but am worried the Ws and mediocre high school grades will get me rejected. Has anyone here been in a similar situation but still got in? Is it very hard to get in as a transfer?",

You\u2019ve got a really good GPA and I\u2019d imagine BC admissions would look more closely at how you\u2019re currently doing in college vs how you did in high school. Worst case scenario you\u2019re still at your current college. I\u2019ve met many people who transferred into BC from all sorts of colleges. It shouldn\u2019t be too hard.",

Honestly having a solid reason for transferring and writing clearly about it in the essay matters more (imo). Although personally I found BC to not be so transfer friendly. You sort of have to fight to get credits accepted. Also you get only one year of guaranteed housing. Don\u2019t want to discourage you but these were some things that might be important to know. There is a transfer student club called TAP so I would check it out if you get in. Good luck!",

I feel like BC just wants to get us back long enough to collect our tuition before they send us all home again for online classes. Many other schools in the state have already cancelled on-campus housing so it seems that BC will inevitably follow. What do you guys think?",

Here\u2019s why BC didn\u2019t give me much of a choice:\n\n1) not requiring classes i need to take this semester to offer at least one online section \n\n2) threatening to force me to waive my financial aid for the remainder of my time at BC if i tried to take a gap year\n\n3) the fact that my financial aid package gets reduced if i don\u2019t return to campus, meaning i save zero money by staying home\n\nEven with these obstacles, I would\u2019ve probably found a way to stay home but I live extremely close to campus and will just be packing very lightly and be ready to leave at any time. It\u2019s disappointing that they\u2019ve made me feel this way, because I love BC as a school and enjoy every second I\u2019m there, but their administration always lets me down.",

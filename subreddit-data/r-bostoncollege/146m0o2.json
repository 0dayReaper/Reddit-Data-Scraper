It\u2019s the easiest way to make friends. The people I met the first night of freshman year are still among my closest friends, 9 years later. \n\nAlso, depending on where your apartment is in Boston, that sounds like a lot of trouble/traffic to get to campus every day. As a freshman you\u2019re likely to have at least one Mon/Weds/Fri class, and probably some Tues/Thurs classes too.",

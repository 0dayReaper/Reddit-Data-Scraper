They handled this so poorly for both classes and I\u2019m sorry you all got shafted. \n\nFor class of 2020- it was brought up in commencement meetings last year that there was a very good chance that the October ceremony wouldn\u2019t happen yet they wouldn\u2019t let the individual schools do anything \u201cofficial\u201d in May to take away from the now-nonexistent October ceremony. They want to do something over alumni weekend this year for 2020 but so many of you have left and I honestly doubt alumni weekend will even happen this year too. \n\nFor class of 2021 - for most of this year, they had us meet under the guise a normal ceremony would be happening when most of us knew logically that it wouldn\u2019t. They still haven\u2019t clarified if there can be school diploma ceremonies, which is bullshit too. \n\nBC upper admin love to put their head in the sand when shit is happening, then act all surprised when they sit up and shit is on fire.",

With the delay in the announcement and the social distancing guidelines, it will be very hard to find a tent to rent at this point to hold a ceremony in person as planning has been on hold without a decision from the university. If they had told everyone of this decision months ago, it may have been more logistically possible but now its looking like most school ceremonies will have to occur virtually, probably on a different day than May 24.",

Northeastern is doing an in person graduation allowing undergrads to bring two guests (presumably parents). Northeastern has more students, 14,676 undergrads, roughly 3670 seniors and is hosting in Fenway park which has a capacity of 37,755 compared to Alumni Stadium\u2019s capacity of 44,500. We have less students, 2,412 in the class of 2021, and more capacity. What is the problem? It\u2019s obviously not the city of Boston or the State. Who has the problem? The City of Newton or BC? This decision pretty much goes against the science about outdoor transmission and we know it is feasible because is being done 4 miles away by a comparable school.",

They are doing two ceremonies because they are doing both the class of 2020 and 2021 so it would make sense that there are two ceremonies as they have twice as many students. Also, as of their website each student is allowed two guests not one. Given Northeastern was approved for their plan I don\u2019t think it is an accurate assumption that this is a statewide policy, unless NE is somehow exempt from the rule.",

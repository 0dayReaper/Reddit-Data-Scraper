    "postText": "Recent email from VP Moore said that the app to schedule and document testing and symptom check-ins, which is the BACKBONE of their plan to open up is not ready after working on it all summer. Testing upon arrival is on a WALK IN basis and you have to wear a wristband to prove you\u2019ve been tested since the app isn\u2019t done. This is a colossal failure. You can space out desks all you want in classrooms for a \u201cformative learning experience\u201d but if you have no way to organize and document testing/contact tracing it\u2019s all in vain. Obviously I\u2019m angry right now but realistically I give it a week before we are completely online. Thoughts?",

Also I didn\u2019t really get the sense that this app is the backbone of their plan. We can still get our test results, monitor our symptoms, and do contact tracing for the first week on campus without it. So while i see the concern, I don\u2019t get why you think the app is the cornerstone of the plan, it just seems like a convenience thing",

Is anyone else paying attention to what's going on at Notre Dame? False negatives will fall through the cracks. That is how the spread begins. It's a statistical fact. COVID-19 is slowly spreading throughout ND's student body. Read this article. I found it helpful, but really concerning. I'm not sure how feasible it is, but BC needs to be testing every student every 2 days in order to prevent an outbreak. BC's campus is too porous. \n\n[https://medium.com/@bostonthomist/notre-dames-covid-19-response-can-the-spread-be-contained-2474bfd7cef1](https://medium.com/@bostonthomist/notre-dames-covid-19-response-can-the-spread-be-contained-2474bfd7cef1)",

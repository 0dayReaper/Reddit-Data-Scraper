    "postText": "BC Sent parents a reopening questions and answers, with some new information. But unfortunately didn't send it to us.\n\nSomethings I found interesting.\n\n\\- All teachers will be asked to either stream or record and then upload their lectures to canvas, although attendance is expected when students are healthy. I am sure this is for students who are isolated / quarantine, and not BC stating  that students can courses online. That option is still limited to international students, and those with disabilities.\n\n\\- Instead of six feet apart, desks will be three feet apart, which is what Massachusetts recommends for k-12 schools, which makes sense because there physically wouldn't be enough room if each desk had a 6 foot distance from each other desk.\n\n\\- Seating will be assigned and attendance will be taken for contract tracing purposes. There will be an 8 to 9 foot \"teaching zone\" for teachers to be a safe distance from the students.\n\n\\-Some people had questions about having an online class and then having an in person class right after, wondering how they would make it to class on time. Here is their response.\n\n\"However, there will be situations where a student has back-to-back classes where one is in-person and the other is online, or other scheduling challenges that make returning to their residence hall or off-campus apartment to attend online sessions difficult.\u00a0 As a result, all University libraries will be configured to provide students with a quiet place for online learning,\". I imagine that you can't really participate in the class in the library (atleast through your voice) or else that would bother other people in the library, only view it.\n\n\\- REC Center will be open, but of course with restrictions. Retreats will occur but with restrictions in size.\n\n\\- They explained that the tuition increased because costs increased. ( \"we add synchronous and asynchronous online courses, upgrade our classroom technology and HVAC systems in campus buildings, significantly enhance our campus sanitizing efforts, and add COVID-19 testing\" ). But they also increased financial aid by 4 percent (5.6 million).\n\n\\- They didn't mention dining, which I imagine will mostly be a grab and go type thing.\n\n\\- Also you only have one hour to move in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here's](https://pro-bee-beepro-messages.s3.amazonaws.com/333451/345031/1039198/5284974.html?tm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ExactTarget&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_name=&amp;uid=&amp;skey=8-10608814&amp;emailid=135936) the link if you want to read the rest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally I think BC is attempting to do a good job in trying to keep everyone safe. But personally I just don't see how 8,000 people can be on a college campus, regardless of any precautions put in place. Students won't follow the rules after being cooped up in their house for months and will spread it around. It's true that people our age generally aren't affected too much by the virus, but I know people who have gotten very sick, and some who have recovered and are still short of breath after climbing a short flight of stairs, or don't have their taste/smell completely back. We also aren't informed about any potential long term affects of the virus.\n\nI also found their testing plan to be underwhelming since it only tests about 10 % of the undergraduate and faculty population per week. The only way to isolate cases is severe testing, and by testing 1/10 of the population per week most cases will probably go undetected. MIT and Harvard will be testing all of their students that they bring back every 3 days. But testing is expensive so I can understand why we aren't\n\nI will still definitely be at BC in the fall, but I would have preferred the option to take classes online, especially since professors are instructed to make lectures available online for people who who are quarantine / isolated. It'll be dystopian to see everyone on campus wearing masks, and will be a once in a lifetime experience, but I'm sure we'll make the best out of it.",

You might think it would be 28 doubled or 56, But its actually 116 square feet. So its just not realistic. \n\nBut of course this further spreads covid, I would hate to have to isolate for 14 days because I was sitting right next to someone who tested positive.",

(Very very wishful thinking, (almost delusional) with 60k new cases per day)\nBut the parents wont have to quarantine they will just test each student coming back, and the results will come back quickly (a day), and then they will isolate those who are positive.\n\nObviously, there is a day or so that it will spread while the samples are being tested, because people coming from all over the country, some of whom will definitely be positive will be interacting with each other, but this seems to be most feasible way, people cant sit in a hotel or motel for 14 days.",

Just wanted to add something I learned from my AP Stats class.\n\n&gt;I also found their testing plan to be underwhelming since it only tests about 10 % of the undergraduate and faculty population per week. The only way to isolate cases is severe testing, and by testing 1/10 of the population per week most cases will probably go undetected.\n\nStatisticians are required to sample less than 10% of the population in order to make sure their samples are independent probability-wise from each other. Without independence, the results from their sample will be inaccurate.  I'm not confident in my understanding of the concept but from a quick google search I found this: [https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/401763/10-rule-for-sample-sizes](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/401763/10-rule-for-sample-sizes).\n\nAs I think I heard from one of their seminars, BC isn't trying to provide free testing to each individual member of the student population. They're randomly sampling the student body to monitor the state of the entire BC population.",

Bringing everyone back ?\n\nThey firmly believe that in person instruction is necessary, and that serious illness of their students or the potential death of their faculty are worthy tradeoffs.  Which just isn't true in my opinion. If you have the discipline, online classes can be nearly as effective as in person classes.\n\nI personally found my math and science classes to be better online since you could rewind it, or speed over parts. Of course there are some majors like art, theatre, music, etc, as well as scientific research that just can't be done virtually.\n\nBut many parents don't agree with paying the price for online classes, they want their students to get access to all the things that come up with a college campus (facilities, library, football games, socialization and making friends,) which ironically will also be restricted because of covid. My dad is a part of the boston college parents group, and the parents were realizing that some of their childrens courses were gonna be online because of their size, one mother commented \"Online classes are completely unnecessary and unacceptable\". They really want class to be in person. There was even one whining about the rule that only one parent can help the student move in the building, and how they were going to ignore this rule, which I imagine is what their child's attitude will be towards the rules in place in the fall.",

The textbook we were using was incredibly confusing and it took me hours to decipher what I was supposed to learn from each chapter. We had an online accounting homework application that already had most of our accounting pages filled in so I never really felt like I would be able to apply what I learned to making a real accounting document in Excel. The class average on the midterm had to be around \\~60% because I got somewhere around a 70% and had my grade inflated to near a 100%. It was then when I realized I needed to drop the class because I was wasting my time.\n\nThe macroeconomic class was a little bit better, because even though the entire class consisted of reading through a given textbook and doing weekly quizzes, I understood the subject intuitively enough to understand the textbook chapters and do well on the exam. When I was stuck on a concept, I tried contacting my professor during office hours, but it was becoming very annoying to try and reach him so I just stuck with going on Khan Academy whenever I had any issues.\n\nI agree that online classes can theoretically be as good as in person classes. In reality though, if you have to juggle 5 classes it\u2019s going to be really difficult to manage your time (since you have to work twice as long for an online class than you do a physical one in my experience) unless BC has a solid support system set up so you can get help when you need it. It\u2019s probably going to be hardest for international students whose office hours aren\u2019t synced with their waking hours and therefore can\u2019t get help as easily.",

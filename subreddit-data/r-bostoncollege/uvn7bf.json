    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman planning on taking French to meet the language requirements. It says that the placement test can be taken at any time and should be done before orientation. Does this mean I should just take the test at home and my advisor will know what class to place me in? Also, is the placement test difficult, and approximately how long does it take? Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",

You can end up placing high enough to only take one year\u2019s worth of French or place out (demonstrating a high level understanding of French that warrants fulfillment of the language requirement). \nYou register for classes yourself so take the placement test before your course registration time.",

The French department has been nothing shy of lovely so if you have any questions that aren't answered here, reach out to the head of the French department, Andrea Javel. That said, for the Chinese placement test, I emailed the professor and she sent me the link to access the test and I had to take it over break. After, she reached out to me to tell me which class I should take. Perhaps the French department has a similar process.",

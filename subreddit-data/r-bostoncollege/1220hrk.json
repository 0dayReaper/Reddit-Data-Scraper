If it gives even the tiny advantage, then it\u2019ll put you ahead of those who haven\u2019t done essay and closer to a better chance of acceptance. It\u2019s 0 cost to you besides time.

This is one website I found on it by going to Google: https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/letter-of-continued-interest\n\nSome ideas regarding what you can briefly write about for the \u201cwhy BC\u201d part (but write about whatever makes the most sense for you):\n\n1. The Jesuit mission- Some BC mottos are \u201cmen and women for others,\u201d \u201ccura personalis\u201d (care for the whole person), etc. It is especially defining of BC, and you can talk about why a particular Jesuit value is important to you and what specific opportunities you want to involve yourself in at BC around this. Also you do not have to be religious or use religious experiences to talk about it.\n\n2. Specific things BC uniquely offers- This could be a service opportunity, their perspectives program, the complex problems/enduring questions classes, anything unique. I would make whatever you say you want to do align with a former experience so that it does not just come off as random and shows that you genuinely make for a good fit with BC.\n\n3. A specific professor you want to have or work with- Like #2, professors are (mostly) unique to BC, showing why BC is a good fit. This will also show you have done your research. And, not just for #3 but with all of these, you can say how this aligns with your future goals and the impact that you want to make\n\nOther notes:\n- Feel free to reach out to alumni to have someone proofread it (people are very willing to help)! And if you don\u2019t know someone you can find someone to contact via LinkedIn\n- You can include things you are doing right now (could be keeping up grades, a new leadership position, a personal project, award, etc.) that were not in your application before and make you a stronger candidate.\n- Do your research! I do not work for admissions, so I can\u2019t know for sure what they want to hear\n- Hope it all works out well for you :)",

I was waitlisted and got in, but based on the statistics it\u2019s a very long shot. I made sure to send an essay and keep in touch with my admissions representative. Though, coming from a Jesuit high school likely helped me a lot. Not much else to do beyond that, other than keeping your grades up, acing AP exams, and keeping active in extracurriculars. Maybe pray that you have what admissions is looking for to fill out their vision of your class? Best of luck!",

I do remember writing a letter of continued interest, as well as communicating with my college counselor that I was focusing on achieving the highest GPA of my high school career. I might have sent a second follow up letter to relay my grades and academic achievements, but I think the behind the scenes communications between my college counselor and high school rep helped a lot. Frankly, I had a hell of a privilege going to a Jesuit high school that BC was already very familiar with, so that likely gave me quite an edge. Anyway, to your point, at most two communications is perhaps the maximum. Sending a letter of continued interest is a must, just don\u2019t send more than is necessary. I only kept more communication because my grades/SAT weren\u2019t exactly up to par with most applicants, so I wanted to show that I was putting in the effort to keep improving. Overdoing communication is dangerous, so be conservative with your approach. Do you know how you might stack up vs your peers, in regards to your GPA/SAT/extracurriculars?",

            "comment": "Walsh: Old, probably the worst conditions-wise dorm at BC, no AC, big party dorm. Walls thick so RAs are comparatively not a problem. Directly next to plex (gym)\n\nVandy/90: Newer, AC, parties moderate but walls are literally paper thin so typically not the party dorms. Modestly closer to main campus and lower dining hall\n\nStayer: Very new, very nice, but also extremely quiet. Minus small gatherings not a place you hang out at. It\u2019s between Walsh and Vandy.\n\nCoRo (Welch/Williams/Roncalli): On the other side of campus from other sophomore dorms. Right next to upper campus, where freshmen live. Dorms do not have AC but the lounges are really nice because they\u2019re the least desirable sophomore housing.\n\n66: Lower campus, very small dorm with only double rooms.",

Biggest common area.\n\n4 person suites r the next best. 1 bathroom.\n\nThen 6 person suites. The sophomore ones only have one bathroom.",

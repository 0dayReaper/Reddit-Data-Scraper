            "comment": "Starting year three with a loss to Rutgers definitely isn't ideal. VT is a hard team to play at their stadium. That place is electric and serious hostile territory, but they also lost to Old Dominion so I thought we'd at least be competitive. I think the team has been progressing and maturing steadily under Hafley, but these first few weeks have been a huge steps backwards.\n\nIt's disappointing to see the dropped passes, the missed opportunities, and the overall lack of focus. I want to blame it on poor culture building. I'm also just an average football fan. Idk what goes on behind the scenes or how to play call or how to run a program. BC has been famously insignificant at a competitive level for awhile but there have been some classes here and there that really showed magic can exist in Chestnut Hill. \n\nI thought I saw some of that magic appearing last year. Then Phil got hurt, but the team held fairly steady in his absence and recovered well. That's why it has been surprising to see the season start off so poorly. You're returning a mature team and star players and the entire infrastructure of the team seems to collapse over a couple of bad drives. To me at least, that tells me the culture just isn't there. Maybe Hafley needs more time to build it. Or maybe he just doesn't know how to. A team like BC, when they're hot, can usually go up against some of the best in the ACC. Remember that Clemson game last year? Hell, even the FSU game last year when they almost came back. When they're rolling, they get it done. But they lack overall consistency. It doesn't matter if your team is good when they're hot if you can't get them hot in the first place. We can't just wait around and hope for a few miracles to kick start them. They have to create their own opportunities and that's just not happening these first few games.\n\nTwitter is full of a ton of fair-weather fans who call for firing coaches over a missed field goal. They rarely know what they're talking about. It's just a ton of people who rather than yell their nonsense at their TV in the heat of the moment instead pick up the phone and make us all see that BS on our feeds. Let them yell into the void, they know as much about the situation at BC as you or I.\n\nAs for the media, most opinion shows are just that, opinions. Do Shannon Sharpe, Kirk Herbstreit, or most other football personalities know more about football than me? Of course. Do they know whether or not Hafley is getting screamed at by the BC AD and Boosters? It's unlikely. People have been saying for years that Scott Frost was \"on his last season\" and look at how long he lasted. \n\nI think there's still a lot of time left in this season. I think if BC makes a bowl game (still very possible), Hafley bought himself some more time. If they don't clear 6 wins though... I don't think he'll be fired this year but next year will be make or break for him, and I don't think him or the team as they appear right now can hold up to that kind of pressure. Only situation in which I see Hafley getting booted now is if we don't clear 3 wins and there's an actual coach available that BC admin is seriously excited about. Regardless, all we can do is cheer and give them a \"Go Eagles!\", so that's what I'm gonna keep doing.",

            "comment": "The play calling has been crap.  Flowers needs the ball more.   Quick slants, screens, pitch... whatever.   Quick pass plays would hopefully loosen the defense,  too.\n\nThe best coach bc ever had was Coughlin and he was asked if beating the #1 ranked team was his best moment... but he immediately pointed to his nfl super bowl ring.  Long term coaches are never going to hang out at bc unless they are mediocre or marginally better.  Maybe if they played there. \n\nHarbaugh always has his eyes on a possible nfl return and Michigan is at a much different level than bc and he played there.  The big house rocking with over 100k, the band, the James earl Jones intro,  the facilities...how can one expect bc to compete with schools like that for coaches?  Or for recruits?  Obviously bc competes with acc teams, but I assume clemson with Dabo is similar.\n\nBut bc should beat teams like rutgers..  This year is an audition for being invited into power conferences with the realignment looming.  Hafley better figure it out or bc might as well play with the likes of holy cross when all the shifting is done.  31-17 over Maine is a pretty crappy look, too.  I'll be very curious to see the UConn BC game after UoM smoked UConn today.",

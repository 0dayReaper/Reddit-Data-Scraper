I figured it couldn\u2019t hurt to see if any current students or alums were willing to give it a read through. It\u2019s only a page long and I don\u2019t expect to get a copious amount of feedback or anything. DM me if you\u2019re willing to give me a hand, but unfortunately I can\u2019t give you anything in return besides my thanks.",

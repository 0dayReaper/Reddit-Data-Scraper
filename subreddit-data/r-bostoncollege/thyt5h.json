    "postText": "I need my language requirement, and I took chinese in high school but I wasn\u2019t able to place all the way out of the requirement. Im still considering it, but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s insanely difficult and Im trying to keep my gpa above ground. Has anyone here taken it/had Professor fang lu? Im also considering Japanese because it\u2019s interesting and (according to the eval site) it\u2019s a bit less intensive, but I haven\u2019t heard anything. Can anyone here vouch for the difficulty of Japanese/Chinese here or recommend some other east languages here to get it out of the way?",

I didn't feel like she was a great professor. She explained things pretty well, but class tended to be rote and repetitive. She also has a pretty dramatic-type teaching style, and might try to sing Beijing opera at you for education purposes.",

I\u2019m not the best at new languages and am pretty bad at speaking but she\u2019s very patient and she helps correct mistakes very well. It\u2019s a lot of partner practice but she typically goes over the day\u2019s grammar concepts well so it isn\u2019t much of a hassle. It can be a lot of work though if you don\u2019t stay on top of doing assignments and studying, you\u2019ll typically have 2 quizzes a week (sometimes 3) which range from vocab, dialogue checks, kanji, etc. She\u2019s really eager about teaching the class though and the days when we sit there watching videos about Japanese culture on the days before long weekends/breaks are awesome.",

She is a super nice person, though sometimes her explanations of grammar are not amazing, especially if you don't have a background in Asian languages. She is very passionate, however, and will do anything to help you except give you points for no reason (very little extra credit/grace for wrong answers). \n\nThere are a lot of quizzes (like 2 per week) and the two-hour day sometimes makes me question my will to live, but in the end I feel like the benefits outweigh the costs. I would rather have a harsher professor and actually learn the language than have an easy one and learn barely anything.",

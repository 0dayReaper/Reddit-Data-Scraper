    "postText": "Hi!! I got accepted into the graduate social work program at BC and at UT Austin and I am trying to figure out if I can even afford to go to BC -- I got a scholarship and a loan that covers tuition at BC so I would have to work and probs take out another loan to pay for the cost of living/to cover the total Cost of Attendance in Boston (compared to the total cost of attendance at UT being covered). Is it even possible to find a job that covers rent, transportation, and food at BC -- and if so do you have any recommendations on where to look?? \n\nMy undergrad was in Austin, my dream has been to live in Boston, and BC's MSW program is highly ranked. Should I wait to move to Boston after I graduate w my master's or would it be possible to work a job that covers my rent/food/transportation in the BC area?",

            "comment": "There are plenty of opportunities for graduate students to work on campus (my on-campus job pays over $25/hour, with a 15 hour per week limit, which is PLENTY). Will that \\*fully\\* cover cost of living? It depends \u2013 very frugal students have made it work, but **grad-school is a full-time gig**. It also depends on what amenities you need \u2013 how far away from campus are you willing to live? Are you willing to live with roommates? (You probably should be). Are you willing to forego a car? (You absolutely can in Boston, but you'll need to budget time accordingly).\n\nIf you're single, you can look into the RA program on campus \u2013 if you don't mind living with (and, depending on where you end up, policing) undergraduates, you can have room and board taken care of. There are limited slots, however.",

I have asked my department about GAs, but those are only for last year grad students. I was told to look into working at the library.. any thoughts on that? \n\n\\+ I was already planning on not taking my car w/ me and relying on public transportation as well as having roommates :) My friend who went to BU lives in Allston/Brighton w/ roomies and says that there are a bit of BC students living there too. I don't know much ab the area but I know that I would be taking the train every day to campus which I do not mind at all. Do you have any other neighborhood recommendations? \n\nThank you for your response and honesty! I appreciate it a lot.",

Academic departments are able to hire only some (in mine there are TAs, who help professors teach, and TFs, who are instructors of record), but\n\nAllston &amp; Brighton are sister neighborhoods; Brighton is right next to BC; Allston is next to BU, but they're often lumped together. (Alston is the slightly cooler, more bohemian place with the Punk bars, Brighton is the more button-down neighborhood with many Haredi Jews). Other neighborhoods are Jamaica Plain (on the orange line, with bus service to BC, but it's pretty far, or Cambridge/Somerville (also needs buses, and is also expensive).\n\nThe T is *not* in a good place right now (the back story is tremendous), but the fares are inexpensive, and there's a decent set of apps that help you track the train and bus, and so long as you budget for the time and the occasional Lyft/Uber, you should be fine.  \n\n\nAlso, in my Master's at BC, many people in the program roomed together, it generally worked really well. If you do come, there will be a lot of people who are in your same place with similar concerns.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been wanting to post this somewhere for a while not to be rude or ungrateful, but because I think other students could benefit from this info. \n\nDON\u2019T listen to everything the career center says especially when it comes to grad school/law school applications. I\u2019m a senior who just finished my law school application cycle and will be attending Harvard Law in the Fall. Last summer I met with career center advisors to take a look at my essays after working on them for several months with the guidance of my professors/recommenders. After my meeting.. I cried. I was basically told my essays were awful and not what a personal statement is supposed to be and I should start over. Well luckily I decided not to listen and submitted my essays as they were. I was admitted to 10/12 schools (8 T14, 2 T20 ,WL at the other 2) and received several handwritten notes from Deans (along with comments in my interview) about how much they loved my unique essays and story. \n\nI\u2019m sharing my experience so that others are not discouraged by this same kind of feedback. The career center people are trained to help you create a cookie cutter application that fits into a \u201cmold\u201d or \u201ctemplate\u201d. Professors are likely a far better resource because they went to grad school and have helped students in the past. I had 3 professors who read and edited my essays over the course of about 3 months until they were perfect. Admissions are only getting more competitive and you want to stand out not have the same application as everyone else applying from BC and similar schools. \n\nOkay that\u2019s my rant/advice. Please DM me is you have questions. I\u2019m a low-income and first-Gen student that just really wants to see other Eagles succeed.",

            "comment": "I can second this. While I dont currently go to a t14 school, I was told during the application process that I wasn\u2019t competitive and my essay wasn\u2019t great. I now go to Villanova law with almost a full ride on a merit scholarship and could not be happier. The law application process is tough but not nearly as brutal as the advisors make it out to be. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t listen to them, but take their advice with a grain of salt and in the end remember it\u2019s your application and not theirs.\nIf that law school doesn\u2019t like your personal story, chances are you wouldn\u2019t be happy there anyway.\n\nCongrats on Harvard law!",

I literally had the exact same experience (except I decided to take a gap year so didn\u2019t end up applying this cycle) but I cried after my apt, was told my personal statement needed to be completely re written. Multiple other trusted sources read my essay and gave good feedback but the BC law career center person literally told me it \u201cmade no sense.\u201d It made me feel terrible and reading your story has made me feel so much better.... congrats!!!!!",

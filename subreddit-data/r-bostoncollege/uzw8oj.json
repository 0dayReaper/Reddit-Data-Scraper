And also learn more about resources like Eagle Exchange and Handshake. On the other hand, it was easy to complete and didn\u2019t require a lot of time or effort.",

I\u2019d say if you\u2019re proactive about learning how to prepare yourself for the professional world (meaning you\u2019ve already sought advice, gone to career or resume workshops, etc.), you\u2019ll probably be fine without it. But, it doesn\u2019t hurt to sign up since it\u2019s free. Then you get access to all the materials even if you don\u2019t complete the program",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m a senior in high school and I applied to the Connell School of Nursing. \n\nIve always known that I want to go into the medical field but with the pandemic, I was unable to get internships both through my high school and independently. I\u2019m worried that with this lack of first-hand experience nursing might not be my thing once I\u2019m in college.\n\nAnyways, I applied to CSON because it is much harder to switch into nursing than out of it in general. BC is my top choice but if I get in and attend I don\u2019t want to be confined to an academic school.\n\nThat being said, how hard is it to switch schools? Is it hard to switch into MCAS?\n\nI appreciate any feedback. I know I might be getting ahead of myself here but I just want to consider schools with a little bit of flexibility. Thank you!",

I entered BC with nursing declared as my major but I know people who both transferred in to CSON and transferred out and I don't recall anyone having major difficulty.",

            "comment": "Since the core is standard across all four undergraduate colleges, it's fairly easy to switch from any of the three pre-professional schools (LSEHD, CSOM, CSON) into MCAS.  You can't switch until at least one semester has passed and you do need to be in academic good standing.  As long as your grades are good, you are still able to complete an MCAS major with four years of starting at BC, and you have a plan to fulfill the language requirement which is unique to MCAS, you should be able to transfer internally to MCAS.",

Several people did switch to A/S, and a few did switch into nursing. I think it's a better idea to go in as cson and then switch out if need be. Keep in mind that, at least for me, clinicals didn't start until junior year/late sophomore year PLUS nursing school clinicals are a poor representation of real life. Lots of people almost dropped out because of clinicals (I personally hated them), but ended up loving real life nursing.",

You can say it\u2019s what is holding you back from making your decision\u2014 I myself did this (this is of course if you truly believe nursing is not for you\u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to switch INTO CSON once accepted because it is so small). If you are still unsure I would go with what the above commenter said and wait it out one semester- it\u2019s very easy to switch into MCAS if you are in good standing.",

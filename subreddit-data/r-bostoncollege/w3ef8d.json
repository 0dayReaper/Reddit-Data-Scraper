On the 2nd exam, you were basically required to memorize an evolutionary tree and details about every single organism if you wanted to get a good grade.",

If you're a Bio major, I'd prioritize molecules &amp; cells as it sets up a lot of fundamental concepts you'll probably see in your remaining courses through the major. Also, if you're a Bio major you'll have to take the biology lab course which is also organized by Dr. Warner. That being said, Molecules &amp; Cells covers basic biological concepts so I don't think it really matters who you take it with. Concepts in Eco Evo are also important but if you plan on taking your lab class, genetics, or cell biology in spring, I'd recommend you try to knock Molecules &amp; Cells out first this fall. Best of luck!",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll make a difference which you take first but I found molecules and cells to be easier since I took AP bio senior year of high school. Both professors are good! Olins is very passionate but the class has a good amount of work. Warner is funny but it\u2019s mainly just a lecture class with a few quizzes and exams and there\u2019s little homework.",

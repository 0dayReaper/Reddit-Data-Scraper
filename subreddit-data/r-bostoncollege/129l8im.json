    "postText": "I just got accepted to The CSOM MBA program and am going to enroll. However, I\u2019ve seen the enrollment deposit fee is $2500 which seems kind of outrageous. Do they give you this back later on once you actually attend classes or do they just keep this? I see a bunch of other enrollment deposits from other schools at like $300. What\u2019s the deal?",

    "postText": "After getting into BC social work program for the fall I started digging and found out about the religious affiliation. Although I do not judge, I am not religious nor are any of my friends and I have religious trauma surrounding Christianity/Catholicism. I am not so worried about symbolism or whatever, just the nature of class discussions/placements and the social culture. I don't want to feel uncomfortable opening up. I'd also love to hear anyone's overall opinion on BC's Social Work program if you've gone there! I have to make a decision by tomorrow.",

I felt the biggest impact of BC\u2019s Catholicism is their policies against prescribing birth control on campus, and there\u2019s no LGBTQ+ resource center. Some classrooms have crosses on the walls. But even as undergrads we were never forced to take any classes about Christianity. \n\nHoping someone in the MSW program can add to this. Best of luck with your decision!",

There is a joint degree program (MA/MSW) with the STM (BC's Divinity School), and many students choose to engage with some courses there; e.g. Melissa Kelley, at STM, is an expert on death and dying, and teaches both ministers and social workers about how to care for people at the end of their lives; there is understandable crossover.\n\nYou certainly won't find *indoctrination* at BC, and there's no checklist at the MSW level of \u201chere are a list of Catholic propositions you are required to affirm\u201d. There *are* people who are committed to helping professions who do so because of religious commitments (or who do so in a religious context), but that won't be top of mind. BC faculty and students are also generally affirming (especially at the BCSSW and STM), though that isn't universal. (The same could also be said of, say, BU).",

            "comment": "As an BC undergraduate Alum, if the religious affiliation is a problem I would suggest you look elsewhere for graduate options.  While I doubt very much you will encounter any hostility from any of the administrators or faculty, BC is a Catholic institution with a clear mission and learning objectives. As such, the curriculum is based on that mission.  To be at odds with the affiliation undermines the educational context and purpose. There has been significant changes to modify and modernize curricula but in the end you will be at Jesuit institution. Being educated by Jesuits once held a significant meaning and honor. Unfortunately I don\u2019t think there are any jesuits teaching in MSW but State programs are comprehensive and considerable less costly.",

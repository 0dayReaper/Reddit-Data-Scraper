When it comes to actual help for a specific career field, not sure but in my own experience they are not good for finance and consulting jobs. There are better resources for that on campus (clubs or just hit up seniors). I would definitely give them a try thought since why not, worth a try.",

You reserve a room for your Zoom interviews so you don\u2019t have to use your busy dorm.\n\nI also got a summer internship stipend from them one summer which was SUCH a huge help and allowed me to take an unpaid internship https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/offices/student-affairs/sites/careers/programs-events/eagle-intern-fellowship.html",

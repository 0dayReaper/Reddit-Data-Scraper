    "postText": "Guys, what rent should I be expecting for a 4bed,2bath apartment (with utilities vs without utilities) in  Brighton and Allston areas? I think I am scaring off the real estate agents I am talking to by mentioning a very low expectation (I suppose that induces them to believe that I am not  serious about renting). I am still talking about a affordable ballpark figure, I am not looking for anything extravagant. Forgive my ignorance on this, I am an international student, renting in the United States for the first time. Thanks!",

All that is to say that while my current place is $1800, it is very large for something that is technically a 1 bedroom apartment.\n\nThe only reason that I bring up the fact that I only search in areas students don't typically rent is because I might be out of touch with the BC-specific rental market. There is a whole business around renting to Boston College students, and it may have slightly different standards than that of the general population. I would say that there really aren't any particularly unsafe areas in Brighton-Allston as they are some of the safest neighborhoods in the city.\n\nGood luck with your search!",

Luckily we haven\u2019t really needed much from them, but the few times we have they have been absolutely terrible. So definitely look at reviews for your landlord wherever you end up. \nHappy to answer any other questions you may have!",

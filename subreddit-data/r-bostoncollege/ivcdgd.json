    "postText": "10) Lane Park: If you live here I\u2019m sorry. Didn\u2019t even know this cesspool of a road existed until like 2 days ago.\n\n9) Lake: Gets you close to El Pelon. Not many kids around tho and kind of busy. Cool park towards the end.\n\n8) Chiswick: Hidden gem.\n\n7) South: The houses and apartments combo is pretty cool but police are always there.\n\n6) Greycliff: Good quiet road close to the heart of off campus. Also close to Brighton Campus to slut shame the nuns.\n\n5) Undine: Ultimate sleeper. Lots of BC kids not a lot of problems, and massive rats. Also you can walk on to the golf course and take some midnight rips.   \n\n4) Gerald: A worse version of foster \n\n3) Kirkwood: Like radnor but a little worse\n\n2) Radnor: Some cool backyards if you are up on the hill also close to the action.\n\n1) Foster: Undisputed goat road best houses most Bc kids. Also a bear allegedly lives there.\n\nEmbrace debate",

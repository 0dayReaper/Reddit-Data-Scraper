    "postText": "Hello everyone, I'm a current HS senior heavily considering BC after being admitted. I'd be a bio major on the pre-med track if I were to enroll. \n\nOver the past few weeks, I've been doing a bunch of reading about BC, specifically about the academics. I've read from a lot of pre-meds that the science classes are ridiculously hard and are curved harshly, and to be honest, it's spooking me a bit. I know how much GPA matters for applying to med schools, so I wanted to know from the perspective of current students: is the pre-med curriculum unmanageable? \n\nI'm anticipating difficulty. That's fine. I just want to know if there's a significant risk of me just being completely overwhelmed by the curriculum alongside managing clubs, research, studying for the MCAT, etc.\n\nAny accounts/thoughts/opinions are greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

One guy I knew was an Irish history major, did a post undergrad pre-med program, and then wound up at an ivy med school.   No way that happens if he did the regular pre-med at bc.  Freshman and sophomore years there are a hard B-/C+ curve, up or down.  Our organic Chem teacher yelled at the TA in front of us because the lab class average was a B+.  The teacher pushed everybody's grade down a couple.  I went from an A-/B+ to a B/B-.  Stupid crap like that.  BC is a top 50 school, so there are some smart classmates.  But only half of them will get better than a C+ in a lot of classes.  Some of the hardest college classes you end up taking at the same time, plus two labs, so it's like you're taking seven classes.  Most of which are infinitely harder than dorm mates being louder than all hell until after midnight.",

            "comment": "It depends on where else you got admitted. The grading sucks at BC, but tbh I don't think many of the people complaining would do all that much better at a different school. I would say the major reasons to choose somewhere else would be the lack of a medical school attached to BC. It can be difficult getting shadowing, clinical volunteering, and research.",

There's a whole city of hospitals nearby but there are also many other colleges in the area with students who want the same experience. \n\nIf you choose BC, I suggest trying to make in roads into St. E's - I have heard they had some weird requirements for volunteering though.",

As a bio major, you have the choice to take computer science I and II or physics I and II and I went the CS route and took physics at a local state college, so that really helped my GPA. Btw, I was by far the best student went I went to the state college because I treated the classes as if I was going to BC, I got the highest grades in a lecture hall of 300 kids in the three classes I took there. If you have any other questions feel free to DM me, I'm in the process of applying to med school and I can talk to you more about that.",

            "comment": "I would add that the litmus test could be the high school biology ap test or whatever standardized bio test there is.   If you got a 5 on that,  you're probably more likely to succeed.   My college roommate also had a significantly more rigorous high school curriculum than me, which helped him absolutely crush the bell curve weed out classes.\n\nIn the end,  bc wants to protect their high pre-med acceptance rate into med schools by destroying all but a selective few to reach the letter of recommendation and med school application phase.\n\nIf I had the opportunity to do it over,  I would have done another major as my low bar private high school curriculum did not prepare me nearly enough.   My hometown public hs friend and bc classmate struggled, too,  fwiw.",

            "comment": "I'm a rising 3rd year medical student who graduated BC in 2020.\n\nHonestly, I think the grading is reasonably fair. Obviously, some schools like Brown, Yale, Harvard, etc. have very friendly curves. But most other schools that you would consider if you're targeting BC (i.e. Rochester, BU) have a similar curve AFAIK, or perhaps even harsher. Some other schools don't have curves, so it does suck that at BC you're graded against your classmates, but I believe that its hard to get As no matter where you go.\n\nAs others have said, grades Gen Chem, Orgo, and the intro bio classes are curved to a B-/C+ median. In other words, top ~10%  get an A, next ~10% get an A-, next ~10% get a B+ and so on, and the median generally gets you between a B- or C+. Physics tend to have a slightly more generous curve with a B median, and higher level Bio classes have an easier curve (B/B+ medians). \n\nI will say that the work ethic that it takes to do well in medical school would easily get you at least a B+ in all your pre-req classes. BC has a ton of very smart people, but there's honestly a lot of people who come into college with poor study habits. Not saying that its necessarily their fault, since the transition to college/dorms/the social scene can be very challenging, but if you are able to focus and study ~3 hours a day consistently (which pales in comparison to how much the average med student studies), I strongly believe that you will \"beat out\" at least 60-70% of your class in gen bio/gen chem, etc. I don't consider myself a genius by any means and I was able to get mostly As and A-s in my pre-req classes by doing practice problems regularly, not falling behind, and going to office hours when I was confused (and often get hints about exams). \n\nBC also makes it really easy to get involved in service and clubs which is also something that can help you stand out in your personal statement and activities list when you apply. \n\nWhere I think BC fails the most as a pre-med program though is research opportunities. Very few people at BC end up in Top 20 medical schools even with stellar GPAs and MCAT scores, and I think that's largely because it's so hard to get science publications since we don't have an attached medical school. The labs at BC are quite unproductive research wise - the undergrads at the med school I'm now out pump out pubs like I never would have believed at BC. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.",

But I stayed and found a small community of faculty and friends that let me at least carve out a reasonable experience.\n\nMy post-grad experience was when I truly flourished socially and academically. The point is. If you\u2019re not making \u201clife long friends\u201d at BC, don\u2019t worry, what comes next can be more fulfilling and helpful. But also\u2026 if you\u2019re a freshman or sophomore and have already figured out it\u2019s not the spot for you. Transfer! This is your sign.",

My college years were some of the most difficult years of my life. I cringe when people say \"college is the best time of your life\" because as I'm getting closer to 40, I don't know anyone who actually looks back and believes that.",

I really have enjoyed my time here and would encourage you to apply. I don't know when OP graduated but can confidently say that BC has changed a lot since most people here graduated 10-15+ years ago. I remember scrolling through reddit last year startled by some of the negative experiences people had at BC. I think forums like this are really polarizing because you only get people who LOVE or HATE something. The BC student body is largely liberal and drinking culture is completely optional. There are definitely still the old-money type of student here, but you will find that at any school with legacy admissions. Feel free to dm.",

It seems everyone here has their perfect little groups who go on spring break to Cancun and summer in Nantucket. As someone not from the Northeast, and who tends to be a bit more stingy about money, its definetly hard to balance that. And considering everyone still is with their groups from freshman fall, its even more stressful",

I appreciated my time there, but over the years in this sub I tend to see more posts from people who feel like they don't fit in than people who do - and transferring is often brought up as a panacea.  \n  \nI can't help but wonder what happens to the ones who transfer elsewhere - do they wind up finding their experience more satisfying wherever they wind up? Certainly makes sense to do if the program or location aren't working for you; and there's definitely schools with different \"personalities\" than BC, but those aren't usually treated as alternatives (e.g. very few people consider transferring from BC to Oberlin, or BC to MIT - it's often, like, BC to UMass, or Georgetown, or NYU, where there's just a lot more overlapping characteristics than not).  \n  \nI dunno, just musing. If anyone here transferred in or away from BC and has any insight into how transferring helped you, I'm curious what your experience was like.",

I came to BC for grad schools after years of undergrad.\n\nPersonally I'm not super into drinking or partying or anything like that. My old school was known as a party school but it was still something that felt optional. Plenty of people were like me and it made it easier to make friends. Here it definitely feels much more mandatory in order to make friends. And as some people up above said, the wealth gap can be awkward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, my impression is that BC is definitely worse in that regard. However, BC is a much better school than where I went to undergrad, so it's possible that maybe all of the BC-esque schools are like this.",

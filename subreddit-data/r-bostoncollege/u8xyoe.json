Appreciate you checking in to ask - unfortunately, our subreddit has a \"no advertising\" rule, which includes \"No crowdfunding, petitions, coupons, referral programs, self-affiliated business, event, or service promoting.\"  \n  \nThis helps ensure the sub isn't taken over by non-BC related solicitations.  \n  \nYou could try posting to /r/BostonJobs, a sub dedicated to that kind of thing!",

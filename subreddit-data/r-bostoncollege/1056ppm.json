    "postText": "Hi all, I'm a research staff member (no campus rec membership) who's eager to join in/help organize pickup soccer games after work hours, and I was wondering if there's already a community for that anywhere either on or near campus (perhaps amongst undergrads)? I played varsity in high school (I just graduated college not too long ago), and I played a ton recreationally in college. Happy to chat more if anyone might be interested in pulling something together. Many thanks in advance!",

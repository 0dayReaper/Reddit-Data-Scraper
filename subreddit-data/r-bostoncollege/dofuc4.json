To all of them, if you're reading this, know you could have prevented this from happening. And do something to make sure this doesn't happen again. 1 in 7 men have suffered from severe physical abuse from their domestic partner, and suicide is growing to be the leading cause of death for middle-aged men. Be the solution. Please.",

What if his friends did try to help him? What if they did reach out? What if they tried to prevent this but it didn\u2019t work out? A lot of individuals with suicidal/depressive thoughts cut themselves off from their friends and family and make it hard for others to contact and reach them. Don\u2019t blame his friends and family when all you know is a few articles passing around the same information, especially since they\u2019re the ones most affected by the situation.",

In the inverse situation to this case, people don't just stand by and watch it happen, especially if it's physical, which this is. You can always tiptoe around the situation and kindly suggest that a victim leave the situation and urge them to get help, but for some reason with men bystanders find it a lot harder to force the situation (call the cops, physically remove the person from their surroundings, etc.) In the inverse situations to this case, people are not as terrified to pull the trigger and get someone to safety. It's a tragic difference of standard.",

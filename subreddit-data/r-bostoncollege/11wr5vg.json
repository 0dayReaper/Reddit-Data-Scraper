    "postText": "My freshman son currently going thru the lottery for housing for sophomore year.  His group didn\u2019t get a pick time for 8 man suites or for two blocks of 4 man suites.  Next up is trying for either 9 man or 6 man (have to choose apparently).  Anyone have any idea of likelihood of getting 9 or 6 man suite?  Or how many there are of each?  Appreciate any information anyone has so I can share with him.  Thanks!",

I'd say there's probably a 1/5 chance of getting them considering there's not that many people left who haven't gotten housing yet, but there's also not many of these rooms. I'd say best bet is to go for a 9 man and hope for the best, if not then hope you get 66.",

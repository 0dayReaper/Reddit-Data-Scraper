    "postText": "So, in looking at schools with my prospective college student, I have to give a shoutout to BC as an alum.  In comparing BC to some top-rated schools some of the highlights of BC include:\n\nBC is a subway train ride away from a world class city.  I have not been to many cities in the world, but I think Boston holds its own.  Obviously, it is not Paris, London, NY, or Chicago.  I am sure folks could name others that eclipse Boston's standing. \n\nBut Boston itself has: American Revolution history.  Some great cultural venues like the MFA, Symphony Hall, etc.  Access to some professional sports team venues if that is your thing, particularly Fenway, which is an institution.  The Seaport district, Boston Harbor, Charles River, etc.  Various restaurants, etc.  Boston has a few live music venues and some big ones, too, for headliners that come to town.  Boston is also extremely accessible with one of the closest airports to downtown around, Amtrak train service, commuter rail, subway, buses, major east coast highways, etc.  There\u2019s probably a boat you could take (or your own) if you can figure out logistics.  It is also a great college town with a number of other schools.  Being able to keep in touch with hometown friends that are a subway ride away in order to get a peek at another\u2019s schools\u2019 social scene is pretty awesome and an opportunity to make connections outside of BC.  Boston is also situated so one could finagle a trip to an ocean beach or hike/ski/mt bike mountains with some even by public transportation.\n\nThe big draw is that BC also has its own little bubble to which one can escape as the campus can be as self-contained as you wish.  Admittedly, that bubble used to have a lot more green space.  BC needs to stop building as there seems to be less space to stretch out in every year.  The fact there was absolutely no pressure to join some Greek Life organization with none at BC was perfect for my interests.  There is also that transition freshman year from home to college that can be softened by having the Newton Campus niche opportunity.\n\nBC is in a great athletic conference, which brings opportunities for fun tailgating.  This, however, has been slowly watered down by the no-fun BC administration for the last 25+ years under pressure from local newton residents.  Regardless, tailgating is still fun and not something necessarily offered anywhere else on any other Boston area campus.  The Hockey East provides some good competition and Green Line rivalries.  If one is a D1 athlete, playing in the ACC or Hockey East would be pretty awesome.  Having the stadium venues right on campus is perfect.\n\nOne of the best memories of BC was a tailgate held in the mods and my BU friend\u2019s classmates\u2019 band absolutely rocking the mod yard.  An unbelievably awesome blast. \n \nObviously, BC has some great academic programs.  Also, opportunities to nurture one\u2019s catholic faith if that is you\u2019re thing, but not necessarily a requirement and certainly not for a number of the folks I hung out with.\n\nIt\u2019s not a match for my prospective college student based on educational interests, but it should definitely be on the list for others if it aligns with your own.  In looking back and comparing BC to some highly rated \u201cTop 20\u201d schools I recently researched and visited, I absolutely think BC deserves to be a little higher in the rankings IMHO.",

I\u2019m a parent of a current BC freshman who - in a world of constant comparison - could always use a reminder of why she chose BC.  Any school - regardless of the caliber - was always met with \u201cthere\u2019s literally nothing to do and the school is way too small\u201d.  She still complains about the lack of huge parties but what are ya gonna do? Can\u2019t have everything :-)",

I don't know if a \"club\" like this exists, but having a group of 'boston explorers' would be cool.   Something to add to the resume, too.  Outings to the MFA, Faneuil Hall, Public Market. Common ice skating, 'foodie' treks, Boston sailing, bike tours, running tour clubs, etc. would be fun.  Opening this up to other local colleges could expand the social networks,  too.  The Boston Public Library is a nice place to study, too.  I wish I had taken advantage of this more as a student, but we did more than most.   Like go to the Sox games after the 4th inning when they used to allow you to sneak in for free.  A friend organized a group of fifty bc'ers to sit in the bleachers, which was alot of fun.  Stepping off campus to explore (safely of course as a city is a city) is a missed opportunity by some bc students.  All of these cultural experiences are sometimes intertwined with coursework, which is a great opportunity.  Available internships in a place like Boston is another possibility not necessarily offered elsewhere.  Best of luck to your daughter!",

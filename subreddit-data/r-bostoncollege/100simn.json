I remember I got counseling for a bit through the women\u2019s center and they helped me during the early stages of reporting my SA which was also reported with the title IX office. \nDeans of students is also a good option. They\u2019re kind of a catch all for anything that comes up during your time at BC that you need support for. \nRestraining orders can be extremely difficult to get. I tried to get one at the Newton court and wasn\u2019t granted one despite lots of documentation of abuse and a genuine fear.",

But most universities have a conduct policy that would include what you describe as violations, so the university would still investigate. \n\nI'm a little unclear as to what the university knows because you asked about reporting, but also said you had a \"stay away\" order. But if the university is aware, it will typically issue a \"no contact\" order to him and investigate (so he will know you reported).",

    "postText": "For those who have yet to take Professor Marc Landy, I'm providing this info to explain my awful experience under his instruction so that students don't have to go through what I did in the future. In the fall of 2019 I took his course, American Federalism. Landy is a published author with an impressive CV, but his course was administered with utter incompetence and his personal behavior was unacceptable. The short version is that he is the worst Professor I've had at BC, and taking his course was a torturous experience that I would never want to repeat.\n\nHere is the long version: Landy is a professor within the Political Science Department who has been at BC for forty-five years. Initially I heard positive things about Landy, but soon I was shocked to see that his course had no basic structure and his disjointed, rambling lectures had little relation to the readings and they almost never connected to the exam or paper content. I was one of the few to receive a good grade in his course; most students struggled due to his inability to articulate key concepts or explain what was expected from the few assignments required from the course. \n\nFurther, Landy often didn't show up to his own scheduled office hours and when this occurred he never informed the class. I once spent 20 minutes outside his door waiting, but he never showed up. When I emailed him to make an appointment, he didn't respond. Worse, he lost both of my papers and his syllabus and exams contained multiple formatting errors. As an example, he accidentally put an extra essay question on the midterm and didn't know until we students pointed this out to him in the middle of the exam. This means he didn't proofread the exam before handing it out. Stunned like a deer in headlights, he arbitrarily had us do the extra question even though the exam was designed to have 5 essay questions completed in 75 minutes. This forced us to rush through the questions we were intentionally assigned in order to complete the accidental 6th question.\u00a0\n\nWhat frustrated me most of all was his personal treatment of me: when I introduced myself to him, he reacted with disgust toward my last name and told me I pronounced it incorrectly. He then mocked my last name using a disgusting and vulgar taunt that I won't repeat here, and continued to do so in front of other students subsequent to this. To give you some context, both I and most members of my family had to endure this kind of crude treatment from schoolyard bullies in childhood (when I was violently bullied by kids who used similar, although more vicious language to the professor in question). Perhaps to Landy treating me like this was amusing, but frankly I found it humiliating. \n\nAll in all, taking Landy's course was hellish due to his lack of professional responsibility and his juvenile behavior both in and outside of class. For these reasons I refuse to ever work with him again, and I warn other students at BC to never take one of his courses.",

The reason being that outside of BC I once spoke up about several people's inappropriate conduct during a certain incident, only for those people to take retaliatory action against me for speaking out and I didn't want to go through such an experience again. \n\nHowever, Prof Easter listened to my concerns and action was taken on the matter. Ultimately I'm satisfied by his response, but I was still frustrated by my experience so I decided to post my account here so that other students don't have to endure what I did. For a while I was very disappointed that I would have to go through this at BC. But now that I see other people agree that what I went through wasn't okay, this has helped me move on.",

    "postText": "Hey guys. I\u2019m looking to transfer into MCAS at BC in either the spring or the fall. I have a few questions if anyone has any insight :)\n\n1. If there are any transfer students on here, what was roughly your college GPA and where did you transfer from?\n2. Is it better to transfer in the spring or the fall?\n3. Are BC students transfer friendly? Is it hard to make friends and assimilate as a transfer? \n\nI\u2019d appreciate any advice",

            "comment": "Hi! I transferred here in fall 2021 from Umass Amherst. My GPA at umass was a 4.0. It was honestly rough at first as a transfer, but I think that was also because I was placed in a senior dorm so it was hard to meet other sophomores. It has definitely been better this semester. I've met a few girls who just transferred in the spring and it sounds like it was a harder transition for them. In the fall we had least had a few days before classes to explore the campus and attend orientation. However I think the deadline may have passed to apply to transfer for this upcoming fall?",

Structurally, I do not like the school. \n\n1. Amherst as a town sucks. The locals hate the students, and practically the entire town closes at like 7pm. There is no nightlife whatsoever which you might want as an option if you choose to opt-out of the partying.\n\n2.  The only areas that are renovated on campus is the business school, other then that the place is kinda dreary. They blow there entire budget on dining. \n\n3. The school is way too overcrowded, students may have to wait 20+ minutes just to get food which can get annoying if you have a busy schedule. There is also no to-go option only a grab and go which is limited and disgusting. Also you have to FIGHT and I mean fight for decent housing and your classes which is not fair. \n\n4.The campus is massive, even if in honors college you will find classes that are upwards of 25 minutes away. Outside the summer months, the wind tunnels make it unbearable and you will freeze. \n\nIf you would like to know more PM me.",

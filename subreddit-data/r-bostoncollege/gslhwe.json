    "postText": "Hey everyone, this past month I built the website\u00a0[RateMyDorm.com](https://ratemydorm.com/)\u00a0\\- think RateMyProfessors but for dorms. You can read reviews from other students and filter through dorms based on rating, amenities, or class year.\n\nWhen I was a freshmen, I wondered why there was no resource to read dorm reviews. Thanks to quarantine, I finally got around developing it and I'm hoping this can grow to a platform that will be helpful to all BC students. If you can help contribute, please check out the site and rate a dorm you've lived in! Thanks",

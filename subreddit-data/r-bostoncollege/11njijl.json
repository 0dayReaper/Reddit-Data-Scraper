Didn\u2019t make many friends, didn\u2019t have lots of fun experiences, wasn\u2019t invited to a bunch of parties, etc. I feel like after freshman year it was impossible to make new friends-Covid def didn\u2019t help. Kinda depressing when all your life you heard that this was supposed to be the most memorable and formative period",

Tbh BC campus life died during Covid and if you don\u2019t fit into the white rich preppy crowd or any of the culture clubs you\u2019re out of luck. Also night life is dead here in Boston. \n\nProb should\u2019ve went to a big state school if you wanted to have an exciting party social scene, but that\u2019s not what I came to BC for. If you have a tight knit friend group and a good career ahead of you then I\u2019d consider that a successful college experience at BC",

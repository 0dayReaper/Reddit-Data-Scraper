    "postText": "Hey BC community, I am vaccinated but have not gotten my next booster shot and BC sent me an email saying if I don\u2019t get the booster by 3/3 I will be summarily suspended from school. I\u2019m freaking out a bit that they are taking those actions over the booster. I prefer to get the booster from my Dr back home, and won\u2019t be home until the summer. Not sure what to do and am stressed about the situation. Not sure if anyone has been in a similar position or has feedback. Cheers",

I remember panicking because I didn\u2019t want to be a semester behind and was googling online classes (pre-COVID). I then got my vaccines updated and sent the paperwork to UHS and was cleared, that scared the crap out of me and I would periodically check with UHS to see if I was up to date. Again this all happened prior to COVID so I\u2019m not sure what the protocol is now.",

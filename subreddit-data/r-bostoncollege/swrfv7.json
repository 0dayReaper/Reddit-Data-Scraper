I\u2019m giving like no context but for sophomores would it be better to have an independent apartment in 2k or an 8man on lower? 2k seems nicer but we don\u2019t wanna be too detached and left out",

Granted it is farther and the bus gets crowded so you have to walk.....but it's not newton....Had a good time hanging out with my boyfriend there. Imo would avoid if you're a senior. \n\n\nI lived in an 8man in Walsh when they had security and ID checks on weekends. To this day idk how we managed to work and stayed friends lol. Tons of work orders, broken heater, punched out ceilings. Super fun though, easy access to parties and the plex when it existed. I was nursing and no regrets!",

            "comment": "An 8 man would make it easier to be more socially involved, they tend to be where sophomores go to hang out since you\u2019re bound to know a good number of people between the eight of you and you have a good deal of space to accommodate those people.\n\n2K is more relaxed living, which is better if you prefer peaceful or more intimate environments. You likely won\u2019t have as many people coming over, but the people who do are probably those you know better and are closer with to begin with so hangouts are enjoyable in a different way.\n\nFor non-social aspects, 2K\u2019s rooms are nicer but they\u2019re further from campus and the distance can be annoying, especially in bad weather. And there aren\u2019t many 2 man apartments, it\u2019s only a few dozen tops, so it\u2019s far from a guarantee you\u2019ll get one.",

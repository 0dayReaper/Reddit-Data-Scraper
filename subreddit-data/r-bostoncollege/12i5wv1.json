Some people think the pits of hell open up behind the kitchens so BC dining can order their food straight from Satan himself, but I wouldn\u2019t pay those people any mind. If your parents are good cooks then it\u2019ll probably be a downgrade, but it\u2019s not bad. I grew up low-income and ate far worse than I do here at BC. The food quality is a bit worse than it was pre-covid though\n\nNow for vegetarian options, I think what most of my vegetarian friends have said about it is something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s tough.\u201d It\u2019s certainly not impossible to be vegetarian at BC, but the options will be limited, especially since BC dining doesn\u2019t diversify its menu options as much as it did pre-covid",

There weren\u2019t enough options for me and I eat everything, I\u2019m not picky about food just food quality and I\u2019d rate it a 2/10 just because it\u2019s food. But paying al a carte for each meal was ridiculous. $30 for an unseasoned and overcooked piece of salmon\u2026I used to feed it to my dog",

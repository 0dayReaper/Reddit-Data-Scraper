Free throw craziness resulting in free bacon cheese fries.  The college basketball thread is giving big props to the court storming, too.  Take a bow.  That was a lot of fun.",

So it's understandable if there are a few absences.\n\nIt's a fun diversion for a few hours and nice to support the school's teams.  This team is certainly more exciting to watch.  It creates fodder for networking with past classmates and colleagues, too.  College athletics have their legitimate place.",

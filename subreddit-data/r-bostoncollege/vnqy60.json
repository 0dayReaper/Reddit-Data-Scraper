It's super easy, he's really chill, but he leads super interesting discussions and is really good at explaining complicated Philosophical concepts that make no sense. I took both halves of Philosophy of the Person with him and I enjoyed it thoroughly.",

He\u2019s so nice, helpful, understanding and an easy A if you participate and make the effort. I was dreading this course and just wanted to knock it out of the way but he makes class super interesting and it became my favorite class. :)",

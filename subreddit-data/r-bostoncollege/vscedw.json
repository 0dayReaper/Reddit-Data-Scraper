Also, absolutely love campus.\n\nLeast favorite - there\u2019s some policies that can make social life tough freshman year, namely being split between Newton and Upper, and how rough sophomore housing can get. Plus, neither of those can really get fixed anytime soon without major changes to the school (or at least ResLife).",

In the past, opting for a forced triple would guarantee upper, although they haven\u2019t done them the last two years (idk about the fall) and they\u2019re usually the least desirable housing option.\n\nFor every other year, you first need to put together a group big enough for whatever housing style you\u2019re looking for (ie, 8 people for an 8 man suite, 6 for 6 person apartment, etc.). Then, you need to register for the housing lottery of that type day of, and a few hours later you find out if you get a pick time. If you get one, you select your room at that time (all rooms are first come first serve), and if you don\u2019t you have to go for another housing option in the following days, and usually split your group into a few smaller ones. \n\nIt sounds simple but it can cause a lot of drama first year depending on your friend group, between forming the group and praying for a pick time. Most sophomores go for 8 mans, since they\u2019re the most plentiful sophomore option, but they still only hold ~50% of sophomores.",

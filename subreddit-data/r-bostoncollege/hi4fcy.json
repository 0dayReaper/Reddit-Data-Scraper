    "postText": "In case Joy Moore's email has you worried. Starting 7/1 the fee is 20%.\n\n(Also, if you take a leave of absence or withdraw, there's no fee, regardless of when you do it.)\n\nHere's the relevant part of the 6/4 ResLife email:\n\n&gt;The housing cancellation and refund policies are as follows:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*For undergraduate students studying abroad or no longer enrolled at the University (e.g. withdrawal, transfer, leave of absence):*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Students will receive a full refund for room and board any time before the start of the semester.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The tuition refund schedule applies to room and board during the semester.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*For students withdrawing or leaving housing but remaining enrolled at the University (e.g. move off-campus) and not participating in an approved study abroad program:*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Fall Semester**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Students will receive a full refund until\u00a0June 30.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A cancellation fee of 20% of their room rate will be applied starting July 1.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A cancellation fee of 40% of their room rate will be applied starting August 1.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No refund applied after move-in day.\n\nConsidering we have barely any information about how things will work in the fall, this deadline seems premature, but I wanted to give y'all a friendly reminder regardless.",

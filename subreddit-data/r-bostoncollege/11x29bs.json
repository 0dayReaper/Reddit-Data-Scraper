I know I get to put my top 3 choices, but I would rather not waste one if it is completely improbable that I will get *that* one. Could anyone give me some advice on what the best option(s) would be? Thanks!!!",

Really nice suites (6 and 8-mans) with 2 bathrooms, a kitchenette, and spacious common room. Relatively new building, fast elevator\n\n2150: Really nice facilities, has a kitchen so no meal plan. Newest building\n\n2k: 7-10 minute walk from campus but serviced by the Comm Ave shuttle. Nice layout, walk-in closet in the master bedroom, kitchen so no meal plan, has a security guard, can get nice views depending on apartment location, laundry room on every floor, and a nice terrace.\n\nVanderslice: Okay suites, elevator isn\u2019t the fastest, lots of sophomores end up here, view can be nice.\n\nWalsh: Can be noisy, okay suites, lots of sophomores\n\n90: Lots of sophomores, okay suites",

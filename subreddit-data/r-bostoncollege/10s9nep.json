    "postText": "Hello everyone hope all is well! I just accepted into Boston college ED 2 and am completely horrified by seeing my financial aid package. Through the net price calculator it said my estimated amount would be 51,000 but I received no aid at all from boston college. Idk if it is a typo since I might have submitted my financial aid documents a little late. I emailed the director about this. I won\u2019t be able to attend if this is the case and am seeking advice to get more money from Boston College. Thank you!",

It's something that I had to do for all 4 years that I was there and they gave me a substantial FA increase each year after the appeal. From my experience, BC is really good about giving FA--I wouldn't have been able to attend had it not been for the aide that they gave me.",

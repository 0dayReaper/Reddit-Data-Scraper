I think the final was worth 20% but I can\u2019t remember for sure. She definitely does not like to hand out As but I felt like she was a fair grader, at least on my assignments. She did take a long time to grade, but I also know she was teaching a lot of classes that semester. \n\nTbh I liked her most because she always made class discussion interesting. She was an engaging professor and did not spend too much time on lecture. \n\nI do think it depends on what class you are taking, how much you like English, and if you are willing to participate.",

I\u2019d say i\u2019m a relatively good student.. never missed her class, tried to participate when i could, etc. However, I feel like she never really liked me much. She always disregarded my answers to her questions and seemed like she really didn\u2019t wanna be there on our 1-on-1\u2019s. Overall I heard good things about her but she has a very apparent preference between her students.",

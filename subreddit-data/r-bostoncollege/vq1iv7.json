There are two 2FA systems, one is Google 2FA (for BC Email), the other is Duo 2FA (for certain BC systems, like financial aid); they're separate and don't interact with each other. Even if you enrolled, it sounds like the system isn't reporting correctly.  \n\n\nIn any case, Student Services wouldn't be the best place to reach out to; it would be the ITS Help desk. (617-552-4357).",

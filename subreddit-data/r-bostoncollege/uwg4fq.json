Most other schools have a buffet style where you swipe once and can enter to eat an unlimited assortment of dishes, but that\u2019s too much for a cheap school like BC. Not only does BC not have a buffet style, but they literally give you the portion size for a 5 year old and charge you $15-$20 for it. Yeah, it\u2019s ridiculous actually. And as for the quality of the food, don\u2019t even get me started. Yes you will get diarrhea and yes you will lose your appetite seeing the food here. The fact that many BC kids rely on Uber Eats or DoorDash and have thousands of mandatory, non-refundable meal plan money left over at the end of the semester tells you everything you need to know about the food here. It will be hard for you to find this overpriced nasty food at any other college. BC refuses to allow a franchise type restaurant like Popeyes and Panda Express to be on or near campus unlike BU and Northeastern because they\u2019re just that cheap and want to rip off the students as much as possible selling their own food with tiny portions and overblown prices, while putting as little effort as possible into making decent food.",

I'm from a poorer background and BC dining beats out the food I grew up with by a mile (I went through a few years of mostly just pasta, mac n cheese, and PB+Js, and a few more of mostly just fast food until I started learning how to cook). But some of the wealthy peeps here would say it's absolutely terrible. Objectively I think it's mostly mid-tier, whether it's good or bad depends on what you're used to at home",

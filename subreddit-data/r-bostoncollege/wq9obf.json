For instance, my campus has one (not a BC undergrad) and I think it\u2019s really awesome especially because people who live off campus come here to do work and study. Also, we have really cool events and live music and it\u2019s a great spot for people to just come, listen, eat, and do work together. I never have to make plans with friends to study, I just walk in and eventually find someone if I wanna work not alone",

Students don\u2019t speak on it really because they\u2019re so used to staying within their groups formed since the beginning of freshman year or clubs they\u2019re in that they don\u2019t tend to venture out.",

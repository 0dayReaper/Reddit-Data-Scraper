    "postText": "UNC CS vs BC CS\n\nUNC CS vs BC CS\n\nHi everyone, I am currently down to UNC and Boston College as my final two choices for next year. I was hoping to major in Computer Science, with either a second major or minor in economics at both schools. I was also hoping to get involved with some sort of CS research, ideally focused on machine learning. In both cases, the price of attendance is not a factor. In terms of pros and cons for each school:\n\nUNC:\n1. Ranked slightly higher for CS and in general.\n2. Change of scenery coming from the north.\n3. Strong school spirit, legacy.\n\nCons: \n1. Have yet to visit and concerned the campus may be too large\n2. CS admission process makes me nervous as I have little backup plan.\n\nBC:\n1. Know and enjoy the city of Boston, near friends and family.\n2. Visited and enjoyed campus and tour.\n\nCons:\n1. Slightly less prestigious, relatively unknown for STEM and CS\n\nI am also considering Villanova and Providence, but as of now these are my top choices. If anyone has any feedback it would be greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "The curriculum at the time of my attendance at BC (2020 grad) was lackluster and to a certain extent I still believe it is. If you\u2019re basing your decision solely on the strength of the CS department (which is a totally fair thing to do here!), UNC could be your best best. \n\nWith that said, BC offers a whooole lot. I entered the school knowing I wanted to study CS, but happened to pick up a Psychology major, tried out a bunch of different courses and got super involved at the school. Despite the education not being fully what I expected it to be, I still came out with a good job. Also BCs new engineering school could really boost how the CS program operates.\n\nGood luck and happy to answer any other questions you might have!",

I found myself having to learn core competencies for software engineering on my own and would\u2019ve loved more \u201ctypical coding\u201d classes. There are absolutely many opportunities outside of classes to pick up for where the CS education was lacking \u2014 the \u201cCS society\u201d would regularly hold workshops for these core things or other emerging parts of tech.",

She transferred to BC and excelled in her desired major able to get exactly what she wanted.\n\nBC academics are superior at the undergrad level, and you will get a superior education. At the graduate level, UNC will be a superior choice in most disciplines.",

That being said, there are many opportunities to cross into other departments if you are interested in interdisciplinary research (my senior thesis involved EESC and BIO departments). The locations are very different: UNC has triangle park, and BC has the northeast. You\u2019re concerns about going to a larger school is definitely valid, I would talk to current students in both programs if you could especially in regards to competition, mental health, etc. \n\nMy experience: I graduated from BC in 2021 with a geology degree, and while the STEM program is not as robust, I have found myself equally prepared, if not more, in my current graduate program.\n\nAlso, UNC basketball is &gt; than BC \u2026.\n\nHope that helps!",

            "comment": "I wouldn\u2019t trust the rankings too much. Recall that Columbia fell from 2 to 19 in a single year because of fudged data. I would be surprised if Columbia was the only university that has done this (UNC and BC could both be included). I\u2019ll confess that UNC\u2019s CS department probably exceeds BC\u2019s (although BC\u2019s is definitely improving). However, I believe that the overall education you\u2019ll receive at BC will be better. In comparing the work I\u2019ve done at BC with the work my friends did at UNC, it was clear to me that BC is more academically rigorous. \n\nKeep in mind that the in-state acceptance rate for UNC is on the higher side, and, in turn, the intellectual level amongst students will vary a great deal. Meanwhile, at BC, the intellectual level is consistently high amongst the population (maybe not as high as Harvard, MIT, etc. but formidable regardless). \n\nAs others have mentioned, BC will have a much stronger alumni network in the northeast if you plan to start your career there. \n\nFinally, on an anecdotal note, I have a friend from BC who grew up in North Carolina and both of his siblings went to UNC. In discussion with him and his parents, they held BC in much higher esteem when compared to UNC. \n\nI know a good chunk of my argument is anecdotal, I have a bias because I\u2019m a BC alum, and other people\u2019s mileage may vary, but, in short, I would pick BC.",

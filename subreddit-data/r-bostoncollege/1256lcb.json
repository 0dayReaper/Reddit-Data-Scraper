    "postText": "Hi everyone, I was just recently accepted into Boston College's SCAS, and was admitted as a computer science major. I was also admitted to a similarly ranked school for computer science (well-known public, not well known for CS), and was wondering what current students thought of Boston College's CS program, along with where they believe the program is headed. If anyone could give any insight into the program, it would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "It has its ups and downs. The CS department is a bit short-staffed, so getting into some classes may be difficult. As for electives, they fill up fast and alternate by semester so you may have to wait a bit before you can get into one. It isn't too hard to build a relationship with your professor and classmates as the largest CS classes here have about 60 students. Course content is pretty standard and should be sufficient preparation for a career in CS given you learn it well. As for where the program is headed, I haven't been here long enough to have a good answer. Hope this helps!",

While not being known for CS, BC grads do pretty well and can be found at lots of different companies in tech, financial services etc. The CS courses are quite standard with the intro courses being more practical, and upper level courses being theoretical. Overall I think BC CS is solid, nothing crazy but it is a decent program and especially easy to double major in.",

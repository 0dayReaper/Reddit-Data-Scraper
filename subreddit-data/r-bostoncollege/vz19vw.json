    "postText": "I'm interested in taking perspectives but have a few questions that need to be answered:\n\n\\- Since it gives you 6 credits per semester, does that mean I can only register for 3 other courses for the upcoming semester?\n\n\\- Was it difficult and time consuming? I'm prob going to be taking some pretty difficult courses next semester while maintaining a good GPA.\n\n\\- Best professors?\n\nThanks!",

You also have to register for at least two others or else you wouldn\u2019t be a full time student (12 credit minimum). MCAS first years have to register for at least 15 credits though\u2026.not sure whether the other schools require that as well.",

            "comment": "I would absolutely recommend taking Perspectives as it will satisfy your philosophy and theology requirements without having to do the workload of four full courses. You can register for more classes but yes, a majority of students will just register for three other courses in addition to Perspectives. I had McNellis my freshman year and while I wouldn\u2019t say it was easy, if you do the work you\u2019ll be absolutely fine (like most classes at BC).",

            "comment": "Ill agree with the majority here. totally worth it to get the credits over with in a year. i will say 2 things: first, if you struggle the first sememster, you can drop the course and still get six credits out of the way in the second semester. secondly, it really depends on professor. i found the course challenging by workload simply because my professor was pretty MIA. i think i had one graded assignment the whole year. that being said, if you put in the work it\u2019s a pretty easy A/A- class",

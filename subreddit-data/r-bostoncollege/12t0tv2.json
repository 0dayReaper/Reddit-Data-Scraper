I\u2019ve only taken a few IS profs since I\u2019m a poli sci major, but they seem to have a higher workload than the poli sci profs do, and that\u2019s saying something lol.\n\nI\u2019d say that for most profs (IS or poli sci), the average is a B+, getting an A- is slightly less common, and getting an A is rare.",

            "comment": "Not gnna lie to you, I thought I was a mid writer because I rarely got an A (mostly B+) in my classes, I graduated with political science and international studies degree. It wasn\u2019t until I wrote some essays for my other friends that I realized I\u2019m pretty good at it, I would spend 30mins on their essays and professor comments are always stellar. I feel like I took a lot of difficult professors and maybe that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t score high idk \n\nBut as far as caseload, political science and IS, it\u2019s not bad if you\u2019re a writer. Most classes are composed of 2 mini essays (4-6 pages) 1 big essay (5-7, average. higher level classes can be 12 pages), and attendance. Some classes are different, but in general expect lots of essays\n\nEdit: the classes can be super interesting, though. If you like writing and do the readings, you\u2019ll be fine. That\u2019s the key thing to doing well, you have to enjoy writing and take classes on subjects you\u2019re interested in",

I took a class with Peter Krause that ended with a 15-20 page research paper, one with Lauren Honig that ended with a 15 page research paper, and another with Kathleen Bailey that ended with a 25 page research paper, all 300-level. Those classes never involved any other paper assignment, thankfully lol",

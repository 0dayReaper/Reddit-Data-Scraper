I feel a lot of college students go through this and this COVID thing isn\u2019t really helping. I\u2019m alone too today and my plans are to binge one of my favorite shows atm and eat candy! This Halloween may not have turned out well for you, but there\u2019s always next year, so try to make the best out of this situation.\n\n-we can be long distance friends if ya want or just need someone to talk to!-",

Sometimes it makes me feel better to remember that there\u2019s probably a bunch of people here that feel the same way, we just don\u2019t know it.\n\nEdit: If you never need someone to talk to, feel free to pm me",

Remember that (except for the kids that all went to the same Philadelphia prep school) everyone arrived in late August without knowing anyone. And it\u2019s definitely not too late now to make friends. Some of my best friends now (I\u2019m a senior) I met sophomore year or later. W/ covid I know it changes this drastically, but nothing\u2019s stopping you from knocking on the door of someone from your hall/zoom class that you think you may get along well with and just chatting them up and maybe seeing what they\u2019re doing for the weekend/if they want to hang out and join you for a hobby you enjoy. Try this tomorrow afternoon (or next weekend, whenever) with someone on your hall!! Think it sounds weird to just hit up a stranger like that? I get that, but consider what you would do if another freshman asked you to hang out. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d accept! Go into any conversation with CONFIDENCE because I\u2019m sure there are tons of others in the same boat, looking for friends. Good luck!",

The only advice I can give you is to join something, anything. There are tons of clubs that are still running virtually. I've heard really great things about Freshman League and Ascend. There are service clubs like 4Boston that are still accepting applications. I (senior) have found some of my best friends through clubs/activities",

I didn't start joining until Senior year, and I regret it. \n\nSo, I would encourage you to do that. And as annoying as \"you're not alone\" is, seriously, this happens to so many. It is sad. I try not to be cynical about BC as well, but it may be a little harder to make friends there. Just join stuff, even if it makes you uncomfortable, even if you just go to an event or meeting once, to test it out. \n\nIf I could re-do BC, I would try to join everything! Good luck, you will figure it out. Promise.",

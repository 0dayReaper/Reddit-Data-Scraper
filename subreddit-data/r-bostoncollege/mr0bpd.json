    "postText": "You don't have to read this. I'm only posting it because I don't have any friends to talk to about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI came here as a transfer from NYU Shanghai. I left the NYU group of schools because I wanted to be in America and the New York campus wouldn't take me. I'm here because when I sat in the orientation room I was moved by how passionately the student-speakers talked about life here. I had also never seen a school in which students gave the orientation speeches. They spoke very authentically of community and kindness, which was a welcome change from what I perceived to be the elitism and hostility of my Sino-American university. BC was my top choice. I remember crying when I got in because I felt like I was going to be entering into a new family. I was excited during orientation, albeit bummed because it was online. I moved on to campus and met my roommate whom I tried to get along with but ultimately failed. I joined a club to try to make friends but nobody wanted to talk to me outside of meetings. I reached out to people from my classes only to have a curt conversation over lunch and then get ghosted. Even my BC Marriage Pact match ended up ghosting me after our first meeting, which I had thought went very well. I did everything the students on the orientation panel did, but I had never felt more alone. Even when I was seven thousand miles from home in a country where I didn't speak the language. I just feel lied to, and it's my fault. I should have never trusted an orientation panel, but I was desperate to come back to America and my father's boss spoke so highly of this place that I thought what I was being sold was the truth. I've learned that if it's being sold, it's a lie. I wish someone else had this spot. Someone who deserves it and wants it more than I ever could. I feel guilty that I'm here and not back in China where I'd be just as miserable but at least I'd have a cool story to tell. Perhaps I am being ungrateful because coming here is a huge privilege, and if you love it here I genuinely could not be happier for you. I just can't help but feel that I made a mistake.",

Do not be mad at yourself, you made the best decision possible with the information available to you. \n\nThis has been an incredibly difficult and isolating year for so many people, you are not alone. You will find people who appreciate you for who you are.",

I've learned that if it's being sold, it's a lie.  \n  \nI'm sorry you've had a crappy time, like the other commenter said, I hope you can avoid blaming yourself. I just wanted to call attention to that one portion of your thought process - students don't really have an incentive to lie to sell the school; which suggests they WERE being authentic, but to their own experiences.  \n  \nMy point is: I hope you can avoid falling into the trap of feeling like people lied to you, when perhaps their main folly was portraying their experience as if it would be yours. Everyone has a different experience in college (and in life) and that's part of what makes it so powerful. Students, especially happy &amp; passionate ones, often overlook this.  \n  \nI'm sorry it's not been working out for you! I hope you can find an experience that works for you super soon, be it at BC, somewhere else in the Boston community, or beyond.",

I, too, could not fathom how so many people ranted and raved about this school when for me it was nothing but misery. I felt so guilty too. I eventually found my way. I\u2019m now a junior and so proud to be here. The journey is hard and it takes time. For me, I think I realized that going to college was going to be more about me growing as a person rather than having the best 4 years of my life. It really does get better , whether you stay here or transfer, it just takes faith and time. Best of luck",

It's an incredibly difficult time to be starting somewhere new, and big moves like the one you've made are daunting even under normal circumstances. I'm not trying to downplay your experience, but I had the exact same thoughts my freshman year at my undergrad. I sat in my dorm and had the overwhelming feeling of \"Oh my God, what have I done.\" For me, the feelings passed. My little sister had the same feelings her freshman year, but she ended up transferring and had a great time at her new school. I think your feelings are not unusual (which doesn't make them any less painful or isolating.)\n\nThe world feels lonely right now. I really hope you find a group you click with or a place you feel at home soon. BC has been that place for me, but \"fit\" sometimes isn't obvious until you get there. Don't blame yourself; you made the best choices you could based on the information you had. \n\nYou sound like a really resilient person who happens to be struggling at the moment. You can do this!",

I'm sure that it's even harder to find new friends in the midst of COVID-19. It wasn't until my last year at BC where I finally felt fulfilled in the relationships I've made.\n\nI would encourage you to challenge yourself by joining new clubs, ones that are even outside of your comfort zone! I had never danced before I came to BC and my dance team led me to some of my best friends on campus. I think it's only a matter of time before you can find a great community. There are dance clubs, acapella groups, and other clubs where people spend a LOT of time together and naturally build relationships. I've personally never been able to build relationships in clubs that only meet once a week or once every two weeks.\n\nYou should also join culture clubs! I found great friends in culture groups like Asian Caucus, Korean Students Association, and Chinese Students Association. You don't have to ethnically identify as that culture group to be a part of it and even join the e-board. Other great culture clubs include VSA (Vietnamese), JCBC (Japanese), PSBC (Filipino), SEASA (South east asian), and SASA (South asian). Many of them also have family groups (eg \"gajok\", \"jiating,\" \"kazokou\") where you can get to know other people better.\n\nAlso, let me know if you are Christian! The Asian Christian community is big at BC and going to church together builds great friendships as well.",

            "comment": "bro the people at this school suck, you're absolutely right and the problem is not you. most of the kids i've met at this establishment are extremely superficial. take a walk around campus and listen to the conversations people are having, and you'll hear how fake and forced they are. it's as if most of the \"people\" at this school are carbon copies of each other, and you have to search for a long time and look carefully to find the real people (the ones that don't feel like straight up NPCs). these NPCs are arrogant, rude, and focused on nothing but themselves; but the \"players\" (real people) can become great friends if you get to know them. the bad news is that you chose a school with a lot of NPCs. the good news is that there are other players here for you to find and befriend, so you're not alone",

To keep it brief; I currently work in IT and got accepted as a transfer student to BC.  \n\nI noticed that students are not allowed to work over 20hours a week\n\nWhat happens if you go over the 20hours limit? Is it ok\n\nIs it often students end up getting internships or part time jobs while school is in session? (Related to tech)\n\nHow hard is it to balance school and work?",

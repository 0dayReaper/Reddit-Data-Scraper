I am an out of state student who was placed on the waitlist and was wondering if anyone who was admitted off the waitlist in past years would be willing to tell me what was successful for them. Thanks. For reference, I would be an English major pre law and am out of state. I have added an update to my portal, essentially a \u201cletter of continued interest\u201d",

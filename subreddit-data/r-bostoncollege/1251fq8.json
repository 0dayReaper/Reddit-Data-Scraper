    "postText": "Hi\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy son has been accepted for Fall 2023, but his aid offer was negligible -- very little money, in the form of loan and work-study. We don't have the heavy circumstances -- job loss/etc. -- that they seem to require to consider an appeal. He does have a non-trivial grant offer from a peer institution, and we had hoped to ask them to match/come close. But his aid advisor indicated on the phone just now that appeals don't happen until June, by which time he'd have had to make a choice and put down a deposit. I've seen posts here saying B.C. doesn't match, but more posts saying that they did, at least for those redditors. Does anyone know the right process for the request? If you got them to match, when and how did you do it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks very much",

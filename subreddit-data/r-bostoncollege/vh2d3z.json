    "postText": "I've heard that PULSE and perspectives award you with 12 credits while fulfilling theology and philosophy core. Does that mean it takes up twice the amount of course periods as normal courses? Also, if I were to take globalization I and II, would that fufill both 2 history cores and 1 cultural diversity core? Thanks!",

You can also fulfill your cultural diversity core while fulfilling another core (one of the only requirements where you can do that). You should be able to check which courses fill what core on Eagle Apps!",

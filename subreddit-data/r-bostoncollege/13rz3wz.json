    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am looking at graduate programs to begin in 2024 within analytics/data science/statistics and stumbled upon BC's MS in Applied Analytics\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any experience with the degree or the department (Woods College, Professor Tomic leads the program) and would be able to give me some insight into it.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "I'm finishing up the MS in Applied Economics which is very similar. I take less machine learning and more economics courses, but all the electives are shared. \n\nOverall I've had a positive experience. I'm doing it part-time, fully remote.  Most of the courses are offered synchronous or asynchronous. The synchronous have scheduled class lectures either online or in person. The asynchronous have non-mandatory class lectures, but still stick to a weekly schedule, you can't \"binge\" a course. \n\nThe program is what you make of it. If you push yourself on projects and do the required/recommended readings, you'll come away learning a lot. However, I don't think it would be very difficult to do the bare minimum and easily pass. \n\nOne of my biggest complaints is group projects. They're difficult to coordinate across multiple time zones and 90% of the time, those in my group had woeful coding experience, even in big data econometrics (ie machine learning) and econometrics. Get comfortable coding (R for most, python for the advanced analytics courses) early on so you can focus on learning the content rather than learning to code. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions about the program.\n\n[Edit] Courses I have taken: software tools, macroeconomics, microeconomics, econometrics, operations research, big data econometrics, behavioral economics, ethics, and business cycle analysis.",

I'm writing about people in the area grappling with the financial impacts of Long COVID, and I think it's important to get the perspective of a college student. If you're dealing with Long COVID and want to talk, please comment, PM me here, or email me at [dana.gerber@globe.com](mailto:dana.gerber@globe.com). Thank you.",

    "postText": "I'm a junior and I want to take summer courses to make my load lighter senior year but how much is too much? I was thinking 2-3 but I'm worried that 3 classes is a lot considering that I'm also going to be working part-time. Even though I'm only choosing asynchronous classes since the curriculum is faster I'm just a little worried. Please let me know your experiences and thanks in advance!",

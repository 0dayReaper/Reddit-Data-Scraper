A couple of years ago it was so spring-heavy that you could put a preference but didn\u2019t really get to pick which semester. \n\nI guess you have to decide if you would be sadder to miss football/tailgates/autumn weather/thanksgiving at home than you would be to miss Marathon Monday/Beanpot/Showdown. \n\nI did a summer program instead actually, but if I had to pick, I\u2019d go in the spring.",

I think his kid graduates from bc today.\n\nBC was a wonderful experience, but having a family is pretty good, too.  I'm still in touch with my bc friends, and we've created some fun memories long past graduation.\n\nCongratulations seniors!  May you find happiness and success in your future endeavors.",

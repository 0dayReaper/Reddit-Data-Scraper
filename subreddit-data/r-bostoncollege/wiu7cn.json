    "postText": "I want to take Persian as a language this upcoming semester, but BC doesn\u2019t offer any courses in it. I\u2019ve already completed my language requirement, and I want to know if I could enroll in a Persian class at another college and complete the course remotely (while receiving credit at BC). Is this possible, or can I only take a language that is offered in the BC curriculum?",

Even though they aren\u2019t being offered this year, the department might bring them back for the 2023-24 academic year.\n\nIf you want to take a course at another college, you\u2019ll have to talk to the department head about whether the credits can be transferred. I was able to get some CS credits transferred from another college (under special conditions), but I don\u2019t know what the NELC department policy is.",

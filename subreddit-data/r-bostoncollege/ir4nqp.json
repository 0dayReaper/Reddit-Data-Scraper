    "postText": "Copied the text below so y\u2019all don\u2019t get paywalled (again). This is a damning piece.\n\nhttps://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/09/11/metro/bc-outbreak-worries-epidemiologists-students-community/\n\nBoston College raced to contain an outbreak of COVID-19 Friday, as furious students and neighbors expressed fears for their health and a prominent epidemiologist questioned whether the school is doing enough testing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to put the genie back in the bottle,\u201d said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of the infectious disease division at Massachusetts General Hospital. \u201cNow they are on a massive chase, and time is not on their side.\u201d\n\nBetween Aug. 16 and Sept. 9, the campus reported 81 undergraduates testing positive \u2014 more than half this past week.\n\nThe situation appears to have all the indications of a perfect COVID-19 storm in the making. Interviews with students, parents, and neighbors indicate infrequent testing of students and staff, weak contact tracing, and scant communication with the campus and neighborhood. Many students said they learned of a cluster among the swimming and diving teams through news reports Thursday.\n\nBoston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said Friday that Boston College\u2019s COVID safety protocols were supposed to catch outbreaks like this one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in a crisis moment yet but we do have to watch these . . . pop-ups,\" the mayor said, speaking on the \u201cBoston Public Radio\u201d show on GBH. \"Those bring great concern to me and to the city.\u201d\n\nBoston College has been testing its community far less frequently than many other area universities, with Boston University, Northeastern University, and others testing all on-campus students at least twice a week.\n\nAt BC, students were tested when they arrived on campus. Since then, the university has been spot testing asymptomatic people. BC\u2019s plan called for testing about 1,500 community members weekly. It said about 7,300 undergraduates live on campus.\n\n\"I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re the president of the United States or the president of Boston College, the bottom line is, we need more testing,'' said Mike Russo, the father of two BC students, one of whom is in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19, the other isolating because of his exposure to infected students.\n\nThe brothers, both juniors, had socialized with members of the swimming and diving team before one tested positive. Because they live off campus, their father said, they have received no support from the school.\n\n\u201cBC brought all these kids back to school,\u201d Russo said. \u201cThey should be taking responsibility for them.\u201d\n\nAnxiety has been rising among students on campus as well. Last Saturday, a student who works as a lifeguard was on duty when members of the swimming and diving team were in the BC pool. Team members first reported feeling ill Monday and began testing positive for COVID-19 Tuesday. But in an interview, the lifeguard said no one alerted her and other lifeguards about the outbreak and she first learned about it by reading a Globe story late Wednesday. She asked not to be identified out of fear of reprisals.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the lifeguard said, BC informed student employees at the pool they would be tested weekly to help ensure their safety. But she said she was first denied a test Thursday and then finally managed to obtain one Friday.\n\nThe lifeguard complained in a letter to administrators Thursday, but said no one had responded to her by Friday. She said she no longer feels safe at the pool and plans to give up her job, though she needs the income.\n\n\u201cBC is an institution that I assumed would care about its students, but it seems like they\u2019re struggling right now to find a plan to make students safe, or they never really had a plan in place that was feasible,\u201d the lifeguard said.\n\nShe and other students said they considered it unfair and potentially harmful that football players and other athletes were receiving weekly tests, but the general student body was not. Numerous students who have been back on campus for more than two weeks said in interviews they have been tested only once, upon arrival.\n\nOne student said eight others in his dorm who are not athletes tested positive this week for COVID-19. The student, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals, said he was disturbed to find himself standing in line at a sandwich shop off campus Friday behind a member of the swimming and diving team. He had presumed all team members would be in isolation.\n\nWalensky, the MGH epidemiologist, said BC has to significantly ramp up its testing, expand contact-tracing, and ensure that those who need to be in isolation are not spreading the illness.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell how large the outbreak at BC might be, Walensky said, or even whether the campus needs to temporarily shut down or other more severe measures taken.\n\nBC has previously said its testing wasn\u2019t as frequent as BU\u2019s and Northeastern\u2019s because its campus is less densely populated. But this week it boosted testing, conducting 2,500 tests, with additional tests Friday afternoon, said Jack Dunn, a spokesman.\n\n\u201cThe increase in testing was not triggered exclusively by the cluster, but rather is part of our strategy to aggressively test students who are identified through contact tracing and target the residence halls and off-campus apartments where the positive cases have occurred,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nThe president of BC\u2019s undergraduate student government, Christian Guma, has led a campaign called #KeepTheHeightsHome, to promote health and safety amid the pandemic. \u201cYou can never get comfortable because of how rapidly things change, but we need to continue as a student body to really look out for each other,\" he said Friday.\n\nEmily Pollock, 21, a junior from Pennsylvania, said she\u2019d like to hear more from the university about the outbreak or what it\u2019s doing to contain the spread.\n\n\u201cIt feels a little bit that we\u2019re being left in the dark,\u201d Pollock said.\n\nThe college sent a note to students Friday evening reminding them of safety protocols, but it did not specifically mention the swim team outbreak. An \u201cincrease in positive COVID-19 cases this week,\u201d the school said, was largely attributable to students interacting within 6 feet of each another without masks, and warned the increase \u201chas put us at risk and jeopardized the successful semester that we have all worked hard to achieve.\u201d\n\nMadeline Bockus, a senior who lives on campus, said she and her five roommates are more fearful of interacting with others.\n\nBockus said she has been tested twice so far, while one roommate has been tested just once since she moved in. Her roommates have begun to wonder why students at other universities are tested more frequently.\n\n\u201cWe kind of don\u2019t want to leave [the dorm], especially after hearing the news about the increase,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m probably more worried than I was originally.\u201d\n\nBC, like many colleges in the Boston area, is providing isolation housing only for students who live on-campus. Off-campus students must isolate in their apartments or private residences, and university health officials do check-ins routinely. (Tufts, by contrast, encourages off-campus student to come special housing it installed for isolation.)\n\n\u201cWe have confidence that students living on or off campus will abide by our quarantine and isolation protocols,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nBut BC neighbors are not reassured.\n\nDiana Weiske, who lives less than a mile from campus, is angry the school has not communicated to neighbors about its plan to prevent outbreaks, despite BC students living in her condo complex, sharing hallways and washing machines with neighbors.\n\nShe wants more frequent testing of students \u2014 at least once a week \u2014 more communication with neighbors, and quarantining of any students who test positive on campus, regardless of where they live.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re falling far short of their responsibility to both their students, their staff, their faculty and the community at large,\u201d she said.",

It\u2019s not news that college-aged kids are hard to control, and while I had hoped that the possibility of getting sent back home would get students to control their behavior, articles like this one show there\u2019s some people out there that truly do not give a fuck about anyone else (seriously, if you\u2019re out and about after knowing you\u2019re positive, you are a danger to society. Fuck you and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t ever meet anyone like you at BC)\n\nHowever, that just PALES IN COMPARISON with the administration\u2019s **honest** lack of care for the students. I thought I knew that BC admin didn\u2019t give a fuck about anything but $$$$, but they\u2019re literally throwing everyone into the mouth of lions with shit testing procedures and a lack of transparency. If anyone connected to campus dies of COVID, their blood will be on the administration\u2019s hands.",

Many or even most students may fare fine, but Chestnut Hill isn\u2019t an isolated island. They interact with delivery drivers, dining hall workers, staff and go out and do stuff every day. They also live in close contact with each other, and if they\u2019re positive and asymptomatic they can easily spread the virus (as the swimming team has, clearly) and that can have real world repercussions for other people.\n\nI understand that it\u2019s frustrating to be cooped up when you were promised \u201cthe greatness\u201d of college and it suddenly gets yanked away, and I personally would hate to be going through my college years now, but this is just something else we as a society have to deal with. That being said, it falls much more school for being greedy and wanting to cash in on that tuition and room and board money [If we take serious action instead of fucking around we could actually get this over with](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2252136-return-of-covid-19-to-new-zealand-shows-that-no-one-can-relax/)",

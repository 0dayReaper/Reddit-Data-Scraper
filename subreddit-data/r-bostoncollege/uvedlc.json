I'd try finding some people who were in the program you want to be in as a freshman and see what it was like for them and if they have any essay advice. If you're trying to guarantee Upper or something, you could also try applying for a couple of the LLCs located there to better your chances.",

            "comment": "I was in the Shaw LLC this past year and enjoyed it, although I felt it was pretty hit or miss in terms of people enjoying it. The leadership commitment was pretty light (basically one hour long meeting every month and a few small events) and it guaranteed upper campus, plus it\u2019s the only freshman dorm with a kitchen. It\u2019s definitely a small group of people in the dorm though, so you probably won\u2019t have a big friend group of people from your dorm. I certainly have friends from there, and I\u2019m rooming with one of them next year, but the entire dorm has fewer people than most floors in others. The biggest complaint from people I was friends with was the lack of meeting people, and most of my social circle came from a few clubs and friends of friends. \n\nWith all that said, I generally find most people do LLCs either if they think the topic of the LLC is interesting or if it guarantees them a certain dorm. For Freshmen, Shaw, HLC, MLC, and (if you\u2019re a girl) Kostka all guarantee you end up on upper if I remember correctly. I can\u2019t really speak to the experience of any program other than Shaw but I\u2019d definitely recommend looking at some of the different LLCs if you think one seems interesting or want to guarantee a certain dorm. Feel free to PM with any questions.",

Typically Perspectives and First Gen are on Newton (if you think u will be rly into perspectives id recommend- ik people who loved it and its a great way to build community), and Healthy Living, Shaw, Kostka, and MLE are on Upper",

    "postText": "Hi, I was wondering if anybody had any experience with the financial aid department while having an income of 200-300k.\n\nI am fully aware that I am not low income or anywhere near that. However, I cannot be full pay for BC. My parents have saved up about 80-100k in my college fund, however 80k alone is just one year of attendance at BC, and they will not be taking or co-signing loans for me.\n\nI have a family of 7, however all of my siblings are adults and out of college. Only one of my siblings is under 24. We have had plenty of medical bills these past few years which totals  anywhere  from 30-60k. I did the financial aid calculator online for BU a few days ago and it said I wasn\u2019t eligible for any financial aid. So I was wondering if anyone who makes sub 200k more or less has gotten financial aid?\n\nAlso, is a work study really that advantageous? How much does one recieve per year through work study (rough estimate). 5k per year ? 20k? I\u2019m trying to gauge how beneficial it is.\n\nsimilarly, does BC give out renewable merit if you make over a certain GPA per year? Most colleges do however I don\u2019t see anywhere that BC does. Do they have any other merit scholarship opportunities besides the presidential, even after freshman year?\n\nDoes anyone have success with outside scholarships?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTIA.",

My dad\u2019s income (mom never worked and passed away last year) was around $40k when I started as a freshman, but he makes close to $70k now, and I\u2019ve still received a near-full ride just from grant aid every year, which I\u2019ve been very thankful for because otherwise my attendance here wouldn\u2019t be possible\n\nI think BC puts extra effort towards ensuring poorer students like me can attend, at the expense of upper-middle income students facing a higher debt burden than they might otherwise. But if the financial aid office is in fact choosing between ensuring lower-income students can attend or simply reducing upper-income students\u2019 debt burden, they\u2019re 100% making the ethical call with the resources they\u2019re given",

Call the financial aid office to ask whether your family's medical expenses might be considered, for example, on a financial aid appeal.\n\nHaving a large number of adult siblings would not be relevant unless they are dependents. Only dependents would be relevant.\n\nThere are some full tuition merit scholarships (the Gabelli presidential); you can find info on the website. Those are extremely competitive.\n\nYou don't need a work-study grant; you could work off-campus. Summer and school-year work typically will not be enough to make a huge dent, but could bridge the gap if the gap is not large. 5k is doable. 20k is not. 10k is a stretch.\n\nFigure out what your family's annual budget is for your college expenses and find schools that are more feasible.",

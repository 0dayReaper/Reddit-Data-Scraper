I can't get the form filled until Monday and my orientation is from July 24-26. During the orientation, we register for classes on Monday. \n\nCan I still register for classes? Or am I doomed? I tried calling student services when I realized but it's closed at 3 pm and I thought it closed at 5 pm.",

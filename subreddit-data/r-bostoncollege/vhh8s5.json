    "postText": "I was admitted as a transfer and the office of financial aid gave me a pretty small financial aid package and denied my appeal. Idk why the tuiton is over 80k but if I go I will most likely have to take out loans. Is Bc worth the loans? I have to do more of my own research but I\u2019m in interested in hearing what current students have to say.",

            "comment": "Definitely depends on your desired path. The networking and prestige were helpful for me breaking into the Boston tech market, which has been lucrative enough to make it worth my loans - though it took a decent while to get to that point.  \n  \nSome majors will find it easier - premed does pretty good getting you into med school, various degrees will be good enough (with good LSATs) will get you to good law schools; CSOM will usually pay off reasonably quickly.  \n  \nOther majors, well, I'd just personally say that I wouldn't want to have crazy student loans with the current job market. BC's education and reputation can help you get a high-paying job if such a job exists, but it doesn't manifest those jobs in areas where they simply don't exist to begin with.",

            "comment": "I'm a graduate student, so I've been at a couple different academic institutions, there are some great resources for students here and there is a good hiring track record out of BC, specifically for finance and business, but overall I don't think BC is that much better than other Boston colleges or even state schools. If you are finance/business/economic major it may be worth it and if you're stem there are a lot of research opportunities on campus. A couple other things to think of is one, this is a really white campus so if you're poc or queer that might be a dynamic you want to think about. There are also little to no access for mental health resources on this campus and it's a struggle for students to get academic accommodations if you need something like extra time for exams.",

As a finance major you'd benefit a lot from BC's name and connections, especially the alumni network through resources like eagle exchange which allow you to connect with alumni that are open to talking and connecting in all industries. The starting salary for Finance is also pretty competitive, so it won't be a huuuuge hastle to pay back the loans. BTW, I like your Sorayama PFP : )",

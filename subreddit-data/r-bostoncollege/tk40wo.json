If you review the slides that\u2019s all you need on exams since the readings barely matter besides the 2 short essays he gives which are basically reflections. Had him last semester and he\u2019s super chill, just wants to know your views on things.",

His essays are also really easy, though the midterm is a bit weird, I got no lower than like a 90 on any essay he ever gave. The first one is straight up a reflection",

Either it\u2019s mimetic theory which is what you typically study or something off course like Kant or something. If you do take him, just lmk any questions you have on his course",

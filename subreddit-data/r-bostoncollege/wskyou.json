    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI was recently accepted to Boston College's MS in Cybersecurity and Governance graduate program.  I'd love to hear more from students who are actively enrolled or who have recently graduated about what you thought, the skills you took out of the courses, how technical the program is, and what kind of careers you felt the program was most geared toward?\n\nThe other program I was accepted into is NYU's MS in Global Security, Conflict, and Cyber Crime.  I'm definitely more interested in the criminal/investigative realm of cybersecurity - how do BC's courses fit into that focus?  \n\nThe big selling point of BC for me is that I'd be able to complete the program both online and in-person.  How is BC's online class set up?  Were there benefits to attending classes in person vs. virtually? \n\nThanks for your time!",

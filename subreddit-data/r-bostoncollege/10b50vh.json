    "postText": "I was thinking if there is some possibility of taking some CS classes from Boston University as a Boston College student. Does anyone know if this is possible and if so then how do I accomplish this? What are some limitations and costs that could occur from cross registration? BU's Comp Sci courses category just seems more extensive than our's to be frank which is why I'm considering this.",

But I like the idea of visiting a different campus, studying with their people and getting a feel of their culture.",

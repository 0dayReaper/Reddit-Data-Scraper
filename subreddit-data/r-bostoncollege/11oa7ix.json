            "comment": "I came in an English major and added an Art History major in spring of my sophomore year. When I decided to do the major I had never taken an art history class, just realized that it would be very compatible with English and I would get to study things I love (art, philosophy, history, etc). And I decided I wanted to work at a museum. I started working on my credits that semester and I loved both classes I took. Right now I\u2019m abroad studying art and it\u2019s the best thing ever. The dean of my school here told me BC\u2019s art history department is renowned for its Islamic Studies professors. BC ARTH is fantastic in terms of classes (for the most part) but it\u2019s really small \u2014 there are very few majors. And the administration is a bit of a mess and can be quite out of touch. But there\u2019s also some lovely people working there. Overall I think art history is a criminally underrated field of study and I highly recommend! My caveats are just issues with BC in general",

Early American art with anderson and sacred arts of the black Atlantic with Daniels. Daniels isn\u2019t there anymore but she was great. Anderson is a sweetheart, I really loved talking to him at office hours, and the class was much more interesting than I was expecting it to be \u2014 he provided a lot of important context to the art we looked at and I appreciated how he talked about the many problematic things that come up in the category of \u201cEarly American Art\u201d hahah. I learned a lot more about Native American art than I was expecting. Most of the students were not in art history, just taking it as a fun elective, and so a decent amount of the class wasn\u2019t super engaged which definitely affects the lectures (participation is very important in art history). But I enjoyed it and the workload was very manageable. I\u2019ve heard great things about the Chinese art classes, and like I said the Islamic art classes are apparently world renowned! If you have any other questions lmk, clearly I love talking about art history",

BC\u2019s studio professors aren\u2019t the greatest and a lot of people don\u2019t love the drawing or painting classes\u2026 but I honestly really enjoyed it so if you\u2019re up for a challenge (they can be quite work heavy) I would definitely try one instead of the \u201cart materials\u201d class or whatever it\u2019s called",

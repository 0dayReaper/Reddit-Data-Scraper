    "postText": "\\&gt;not muting chat\n\nI saved the entire chat, here are my favorite quotes:\n\n* How do you mute the chat\n\n* So ya finally addressing racism on campus, its about time\n \n* So are they gonna talk about and address the hate crimes or just throw out meaningless platitudes?\n\n* Im atheist, what\u2019s going on\n \n* We are praying to stop racism\n \n* Everyone in this chat is a comedian\n \n* LGBDBT\n \n* Im convinced Leahy isn\u2019t real\n\n* Be pretty cool if you guys would divest from fossil fuels\n\n* everyone ignore the anti-asian behavior in CLXF but nobody talks about that\n\n* maybe Leahy was the friends we made along the way\n\n* Btw did you all know that our football coach gets payed 2.2 million dollars a year\n\n* Im a bu student idk y I am here\n \n* Yea wanna address hate crimes and divest from fossil fuels or just talk about your values?\n\n* actions speak louder than words, what is BC going to do about it??\n\nnothing\n\n* This webinar feels like a hate crime\n\n* Maybe we should actually expel people that are racist on campus\n\n* I live on mle and I can firmly say you dont respect us\u2026. How about you suspend the people that threaten our lives\n\n* when Catholic values are important when it comes to not making an LGBTQ center but not for fossil fuels\n\n* Can we talk about BC dining and why they\u2019re not serving chicken tenders daily?\n\n* Also how come the two guys that committed hate crimes on the MLE floor are back on campus after like a week? I\u2019m guessing they have donor families but you couldn\u2019t even make it a semester? A week?\n\n* When catholic values are more important than respecting other peoples religions\n\n* If we expel all the racists, our population would be cut in half... WHICH ALSO MEANS MROE EIGHT MAN PICK TIMES\n\n* BC burger anyone?\n\n* That\u2019s a lot of words to say there were hate crimes on campus\u2026\n\n* I hope legitimate criticism of the administration isn\u2019t seen as disrespect\n\n* \ud835\udd5e\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd6a\ud835\udd53\ud835\udd56 \ud835\udd55\ud835\udd60 \ud835\udd64\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd66\ud835\udd57\ud835\udd57 \ud835\udd52\ud835\udd53\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd66\ud835\udd65 \ud835\udd65\ud835\udd59\ud835\udd56 \ud835\udd61\ud835\udd63\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd53\ud835\udd5d\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd5e\ud835\udd64 \ud835\udd53\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd6a\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd5f\ud835\udd55 \ud835\udd5b\ud835\udd66\ud835\udd64\ud835\udd65 \ud835\udd65\ud835\udd59\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd64\ud835\udd56 \ud835\udd57\ud835\udd66\ud835\udd5f \ud835\udd5d\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd5d\ud835\udd56 \ud835\udd68\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd53\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd5f\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd63\ud835\udd64\n\n* \u201cThe University is committed to enhancing the University\u2019s culture of care and welcome for all\u201d \u2014 unless you are LGBTQ+ or non-white\n\n* the people that yelled racial slurs on the MLE floor are walking free on campus with no punishment\n\n* ^\n\n* Y\u2019all racist AND not giving us Tendies",

If they want to address racism within the student body they should take quantifiable action, or at the LEAST have people who are actually qualified to talk about these these things do so, not freaking Tom Mogan. This felt more like a box for the administration to check rather than any actual attempt to resolve these issues, and that\u2019s disappointingly indicative of the administration as a whole.",

They were singing a song about \"cape cod girls,\" but the people on the MLE floor heard \"colored girls.\"  Obviously the MLE floor has the right to be upset because what they heard was racist, but they just misheard what the two boys were singing.  according to the webinar, BC isn't allowed to discuss what happened in the conduct trial so that's why they haven't come out and said it was all a misunderstanding.",

It's not our job to educate ignorant people and, after the slap on the wrist those bastards who were on the MLE floor recieved, none of us trust the administration to do anything about it. Like on Sunday I heard someone yell \"You fucking f****t\" outside my building. Wtf am I gonna report? Some anonymous guy at an unknown time yelled a slur that wasn't directed at me? If I reported that and they, by some miracle, found the guy all he'd have to do was say \"Oh I didn't know\" or \"I was just joking around\" and they'd let him off the hook. Don't emphasise reporting HATE CRIMES (cause that's what they are, let's not downplay that) if you have a track record of doing fuck all with the reports.",

I had some really great professors and classes, and met some really nice/motivated people. Thankfully my financial aid was pretty good.\n\nI have seen this with my friends too. I feel like someone should have told me just getting the degree wouldn\u2019t help with jobs.",

We're not a vocational school, I'd imagine the *vast* majority of graduates either go to post-grad programs or learn professional skills on the job. Very few liberal arts degrees actively train you for the job you wind up taking.  \n  \nEven having graduated with a bach sci in CS, we didn't really learn tools and tech that I'd be using in my career - I'd have to have gone to an engineering school for that. But we learned ways of thinking about computers that made it easier for me to absorb lessons on the fly when I started working.  \n  \nWhen it comes to finding jobs, that's harder, but that's one thing BC at least does comparatively well - you just have to be tapped into the networking opportunities as much as possible.",

There's a reason why higher ed tends to favor wealthier demographics, regardless of financial aid incentives - it's essentially a luxury. IMO there's no question the better value education is at a decent public school.  \n  \nI wish that was discussed more readily with high schoolers - you don't magically develop a sense of how much college debt actually costs you until you're already out &amp; paying it.",

E.g. I switched into CS at the end of sophomore year when I realized I didn't want to struggle to find a career in music.  \n  \nIt's not too late to take advantage of some benefits BC has, though - make sure you're signed up for alumni network events, and if you can, develop some connections through that. There are also continuing education opportunities for learning more tactical skills you may find useful.",

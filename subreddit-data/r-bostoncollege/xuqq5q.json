We haven't explored Chestnut Hill at all, what are some cool bars, restaurants, places to see, etc. that students enjoy going to? Thanks!",

Saturday, Tailgating won\u2019t start until 3:30pm, so maybe grab lunch at Cityside in Cleveland Circle, or any bars in Allston as it\u2019s close enough to BC. Usually a LOT of Clemson fans at this one, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find something tailgate wise. Chestnut Hill itself is kind of a vague area tbh. Also if you\u2019re into it I\u2019d check out the MFA or Isabella Stewart Gardner museum, or the Boston Public Library.",

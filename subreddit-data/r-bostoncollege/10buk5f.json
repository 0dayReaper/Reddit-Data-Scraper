Struggling to decide which one to pick and spring semester starts in a few days so I need to make a decision quickly lol. Thanks!!",

Was one of my favorite classes at BC and I\u2019m a STEM major. \nI found that I didn\u2019t have to do any of the longer outside readings to do well in the class. I did the short readings to do the weekly 250 word discussion post. All I did was show up and pay attention/ take notes for the 50 minutes and I got a ton out of the class. Idk about Jacobs, but some of the other professors set a time limit for their weekly take home quiz (very easy tho).\nEither way this class is very standardized so I don\u2019t think you can go wrong with either professor.",

            "comment": "The percent is not set in stone because it depends on how many juniors take 8-person suites first (they will have more combined points than a sophomore group and therefore will get priority). Stayer will usually be all juniors, and the upper floors of Vandy and 90 will be juniors (also the nice rooms at the end of 90 with the big windows). So it\u2019s not rare but it\u2019s not most sophomores. It might be less than half of the 8-person sophomore groups get a pick time. Sorry that\u2019s not very helpful - keep an eye on Reslife\u2019s Instagram during the housing melee to get updates from them on what\u2019s still available.\n\nMy number one tip is to please decide with your WHOLE GROUP OF 8 what you\u2019ll do if you don\u2019t get your 8-person suite. You need to have it written down and agreed upon by everyone how you\u2019ll split into two 4s, if you want to even try for 6 or 9 day, and how you\u2019d split into traditional doubles. I am serious, housing week ruins friendships and this is how you avoid it. Know your plan going in so no one gets dropped by their group unexpectedly.",

Basically, the graduate students had an NLRB overseen vote in 2016 back during the Obama administration, after the NLRB officially ruled grad student workers could organize (voted to unionize) BC appealed the decision, but under the Trump administration\u2019s NLRB it was clear BC would win its appeal, which would subsequently have removed the 2016 precedent allowing other graduate students at other universities with more supportive administrations to unionize. Because of this, the BC grad student union withdrew their attempt to unionize from the NLRB and as such BC is legally in the right here - they withdrew and as such the 2016 vote does not matter.\n\nAlso unfortunately for the union, this petition will do absolutely nothing (it won\u2019t even be read). The last time the union wrote a petition, Kevin Shea took the petition and subsequently shut the door on the state senator who delivered it. \n\nhttp://www.bcgavel.com/2018/12/10/graduate-student-union-lead-by-state-senator-jamie-eldridge-deliver-petition-denied-audience-with-father-leahy/",

The decision that grad student workers are able to unionize was upheld by the national labor relations board at some point around 2015 (though this decision has gone back and fourth depending on who is president) sparking the most recent unionization effort at BC, which is still very much alive and well. The grad worker union isn\u2019t asking permission for BC to recognize them as a student group, which, sure, BC has total control over and could reject. Instead, the union is generally asking that BC respect the result of the vote that grad workers had years ago. At that point, BC set the list of eligible graduate workers (defined as grads who get paid by BC in exchange to do work for BC like research or teaching) and organized the polls at a building somewhere on campus(with labor board/union oversight). At the end the labor board came, the union came, and BC officials came to tally the results of the vote, and all parties agreed that the workers voted in favor of unionization. While it\u2019s true that post-vote the BC admin has taken the opposite position of, for example, the Georgetown admin and repeatedly refused to take the next step and bargain a contract with its employees, the union is still organized and continually fighting for a contract (the contract being the next step after a vote). For political reasons, that next step is being stalled, and so BC is taking the strategy of just pretending like the union doesn\u2019t exist and hoping it\u2019ll just go away. This so far has worked at some other schools for now and unfortunately might work here, orrrrrrr it might just make everything worse! I\u2019m still hopeful for a contract in the long run, though I probably won\u2019t see one before I graduate. \n\nIm literally just arguing semantics here but to me it just rings not quite right to say that BC doesn\u2019t allow unions, because it implies they have the power to ban unions in the first place. I\u2019m sure they would if they could. I understand why people have that impression though, because if you\u2019re not involved with the weekly meetings or a grad worker getting union updates, then your source is likely just the occasional email from admin, maybe with some gavel interviews occasionally. The emails the admin have sent tend to be pretty misleading, and don\u2019t really reflect the reality. The admin will still make things make things difficult for the union and threaten it privately or minimize it publicly but they still have to follow labor law (sort of) which means not interfering with union activity on campus. (In practice they kinda don\u2019t like following labor law but can kinda get away with it to an extent, things are complicated, and it gets messy).\n\nTLDR: They don\u2019t like it but can\u2019t ban it",

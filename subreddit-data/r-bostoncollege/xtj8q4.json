I also am struggling very much to find internships and think I have a better chance applying when I'm finished junior year. For a few other reasons, I would like to take a gap year.",

For medical/mental health, doctors and therapists communicate with UHS/UCS. If you\u2019re planning to do it after junior year, even if you\u2019re in a tough place mentally, a personal leave is the easiest way to go.",

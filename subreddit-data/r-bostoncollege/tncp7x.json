While my family could afford it, it would still be challenging.\n\n1. How is the quality of the Finance and Information Systems programs?\n2. How hard is it to get summer internships?\n3. What are peoples opinions of the professors and student body?\n\nThanks so much!",

As a student of color, I have had a lot of opportunities open up at certain companies that I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise been able to get.\n \n3. Incredibly positive, the best professors I\u2019ve had here have been csom professors, however the student body can be a bit obnoxious in csom",

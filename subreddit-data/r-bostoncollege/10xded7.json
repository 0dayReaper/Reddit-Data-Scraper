I\u2019m a political science student and I\u2019m working on a project to inform and connect Boston residents and communities with their local government by creating and distributing a weekly newsletter summarizing Boston City Council meetings. My goal is to make important government proceedings accessible so busy people can understand what is going on in their city and how they might be affected by new policies. If anyone is interested in a quick digestible update on Boston government I have included my newsletter and the link to get free weekly information about local issues important to life in Boston.

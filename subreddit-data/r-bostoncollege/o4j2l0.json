    "postText": "First time posting here, but I think that we as the Boston College community greatly overlook the incredible perseverance, resilient work ethic, and unreplicable value of our CSOMers. Allow me to demonstrate.\n\n1. They chose **the hardest major at Boston College** (true story). I was sitting in a room with a CSOM boy and a Neuro major, and clearly, the CSOMer was working harder. He only looked at Tiktok every 5 minutes as a break from his networking emails, whereas the Neuro major only got through 10 chapters for his Orgo exam (lazy IMO). People never acknowledge the *sheer amount of hard work* that goes into networking emails, not to mention **the stress when you don't have homework**. Exams worth 80% of my grade? No thanks.\n2. **Their** **personalities are unbeatable.** I feel so loved and appreciated when I hang out with CSOMers. They really understand the world that we live in, better than any of the MCAS kids, to be frank. One time, a CSOMer said \"Hi\" to me, and pretended to have a conversation while my hotter friend was in the bathroom, even though he just wanted *her* number. Sure, he left me the second she came back but he tried to make me feel included, and that goes a long way!\n3. **They choose this career even though they make very little money, just so they can leave the biggest impact on society.** I think this is pretty self explanatory. A lot of people think doctors are the most selfless professionals, but I would argue that bankers are. They help further our capitalism, which is the backbone of an ethical society. Did you know that **investment bankers actually have the same hourly wages as Mcdonald's workers**? Bankers just work more hours because fast-food employees aren't \"built different.\"\n4. **They make you feel things you didn't know you could feel.** This point is a little emotional for me. I used to be very happy-go-lucky, with no real substance or intriguing qualities. But then I met Jack, this amazing Patagonia-vest-wearing, latte-drinking, bank-recruiting boy. He strung me along for weeks, and I think I knew this was not going to be anything serious. But I was okay with it, because it was a *privilege* to be played by him; several other people told me the same thing! He allowed me to feel all kinds of sadness, darkness, and lack of self-worth. At the end of the day, this allowed me to grow as a human being. It made me who I am, and I am so thankful for him.\n5. **Their names are easy.** Chad? Brad? John? Luke? Liam? Brendan? It's GREAT to meet you.\n\nIn short, thank you CSOMers. Your heartwarming contributions to society do not go overlooked.",

Trust me, it's the long-joke that rolls out in your favor. They will look at your insta with you living your life, family, friends, probably a fun and exciting career. And then they will look at this power point at 3am and the text from their girlfriend that she's leaving him.  He'll cry a bit, maybe even have a wank in the bathroom stall, and then get back to flippin slides.",

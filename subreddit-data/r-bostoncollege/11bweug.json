    "postText": "I was thinking of withdrawing from a course that isn't relevant to my major or core. My course load will drop to 12 credits this semester as a result. Will this affect my financial aid (scholarship and pell grant) ? To my knowledge it shouldn't since 12 credits per semester is the minimum requirement to be considered a full time student.",

I know for a fact that they double qualify at least once, I just don\u2019t necessarily know how many times you CAN double qualify them.  However, there aren\u2019t many options for that so you\u2019d have to look hard to do it more than once.",

Specifically for diversity, anything used to fulfill the diversity core can also be used for any other part of the core, a major, or a minor per the academic policies and procedures found [here](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/academics/sites/university-catalog/policies-procedures.html#tab-undergraduate_academic_regulations) (under \"Core Curriculum\").",

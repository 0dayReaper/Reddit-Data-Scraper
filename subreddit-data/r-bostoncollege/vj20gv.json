That will make you stick out as a candidate and they may be able to set something up for you without it even making it on the website yet. I\u2019d recommend going for a library type of job or monitor of a study space (contact reslife for the latter). You usually can just sit and do homework during those while you make money",

If nothing else, it may make you more prepared for whenever they begin their process and what they require.",

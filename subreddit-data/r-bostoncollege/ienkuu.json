    "postText": "I am the first person to blame the administration for irresponsibly bringing students back to campus during a global pandemic. I also really hate their inadequate testing policy and general callousness towards community/off campus well being. To be clear whatever happens this fall the burden of blame should fall on the administration. That being said we find ourselves in the position of having to try and get through this semester safely like it or not. My bet is that well all be going home within 3 week of classes start, but I really hope that I\u2019m wrong. I think students aren\u2019t realizing that if we get kicked off this fall the chance of us coming back in the spring is incredibly low. Faculty, staff, many parents, and most importantly the local community won\u2019t allow us to come back in person in the spring if conditions are similar and the our fall reopening went up in flames. Even with the most optimistic timeline we won\u2019t have a widely available vaccine by the spring, so anyone banking on that should seriously reconsider those hopes. I know that the BC reddit community is generally not the section of the BC undergrad population that will go out partying mid pandemic, but if you\u2019re on campus and it gets tempting I hope that you realize that you\u2019re jeopardizing everyone\u2019s fall and spring semesters. This is the last year year at BC for many students the first for many others, please act  responsibly so you aren\u2019t part of the reason we get sent home.",

            "comment": "This is a good point, a lot of people don\u2019t realize this. Villanova admin told their students that they would likely not go back spring semester if no one behaves in the fall. This isn\u2019t an administration issue; they could be doing 10 times as many tests but all of that wouldn\u2019t matter if they feel like we don\u2019t care. Why go through all the trouble of reopening for the spring if the students blatantly don\u2019t care about the pandemic? I think the pandemic situation will be much much much better in the spring of next year, but that won\u2019t even matter if the student body doesn\u2019t do their part right now",

So if you get infected while you are traveling, in the airport or on a plane for example, you likely won't show up positive in a test the next day. Northeastern is testing everyone 3 times when they return, the 1st day, the 3rd day, and the 5th day. This is being done precisely for this reason. Many people who contracted the virus en route to BC will get a negative test on day 1 but would show up positive on day 3 or 5. At NU they'd identify that person and quarantine them. At BC they will spread the disease to roomates and others.",

If I catch the disease while I am at BC, chances are I will never be tested until I become sick, and at that point I've infected roommates and friends. BC has 10k students and is doing 1k tests a week, so chances are I will never be tested under thier program. Which of those scenarios seems safer and more likely to limit the spread of the disease?",

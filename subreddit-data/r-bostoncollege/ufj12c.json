Bachelor of Arts option allows for less math and science courses which will also make it easier. Professors are mostly mid with some exceptions of great ones.",

            "comment": "Current CS student, and I'd personally disagree with the other opinion here. It's true that you'd take less math and science courses with a BA, but we also offer a BS in CS. You'd get a pretty standard CS education comparable to any college with that route.\n\nWhat I like about the program (both BA and BS) is that it's very flexible. If you fill your upper-level courses with difficult classes, the CS program at BC can be very rigorous. But you can also fill your schedule with easier classes. This basically means that the CS experience can be a very different person to person at this school. (For example you can take three Earth science classes or two physics classes to fill the science component for the BS. For upper-level courses, you can take Web Dev or Visualization etc.)\n\nI think our department is getting better. There have been some real standouts in our recent hires (Wiseman and Kim come to mind) and with the new Schiller building, there's more space so it looks like the department is trying to add variety to our courses.\n\nThe downside to our CS program is that we lack a recruitment pipeline or co-op program. This makes finding internships harder, but it isn't really difficult either. It basically just means no one will guide you through the internship/job search process. Just be mindful of this and look up info online/be proactive about asking upperclassmen etc. and there is no reason that a BC CS degree will hold you back from anything you want to do.\n\nI've really enjoyed my time as a CS student at BC so far. On the social aspect, what's really great about our CS students here is the lack of a toxic competitive culture. Everyone is willing to help each other out, and I've heard from my friends at other schools this isn't always the case in CS.\n\nSome advice for CS1, try to get Wiseman (took Systems with him and it was great), Prud'hommeaux (heard good things about her), or Griffith (is hit or miss but I had him for CS1 and liked him). No one I know liked Bolotin so try to avoid her.",

Had him for CS2 and he's kinda the goat.\n\nAbout the recruitment pipeline, honestly, reach out to some professors. A decent handful of freshmen that I know are involved in projects and the professors are more available than you might presume. So just shoot them an email saying you're interested in their work. It's not the same as work experience, for sure, but it's respectable in its own regard. Kim is an example; have heard great things about him and he seemed like a real supportive guy in my brief interactions with him.",

Admissions is looking for people who have *some* understanding of Jesuit ideals, and the notion that you'd gain nothing from a conversation partner who isn't you runs directly contrary to those ideals.  \n\nAt best, you'd sound kinda cute but clueless.  Not a compelling look in a highly competitive process.",

In other words, it runs (what I think is) a risk of getting too abstract or detached from the real world. I\u2019d approach it in a different way, but if you write something compelling enough, these smaller details won\u2019t really matter",

    "postText": "hi!\n\ni recently got into BC as a transfer student. my financial aid is okay, but i would still have to pay more than i can afford, which is unfortunate since my EFC is 0. has anyone tried to appeal/negotiate their financial aid and was successful? i got an offer from another school (Vanderbilt) and they gave me more aid than BC, could i try to get BC to match Vanderbilt's financial aid amount, since I'm 100% committing to BC if they do? any information/advice would be greatly appreciated!!",

In many ways it\u2019s BC south with better weather (and better academic ratings).\n\nWrite a letter and call the financial aid office. I\u2019d probably start off with a call immediately. I\u2019d be shocked if you didn\u2019t get some sort of match. Now it could be different if the financial aid Vandy is offering is different than what BC is offering, (grants vs loans; merit scholarship vs grants, etc.). Just know all of the ins and outs so you can best be prepared.",

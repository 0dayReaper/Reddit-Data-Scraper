    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am visiting BC on Friday to come see the women\u2019s lacrosse team take on SU at alumni stadium. I have never been to BC (or Boston) before and was wondering where to go when game starts. I know that you do not need a ticket, so do I literally just walk into alumni stadium? Where is the main entrance? Just looking for some general info that I can not find anywhere on the internet. \n\nTYIA",

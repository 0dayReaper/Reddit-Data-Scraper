I just parked there and paid less than $100/month in fines to the City of Newton for the few months I needed it.\n\nAnytime I wonder if I was really smart enough to get into BC I think about this and realize the answer was \"Yes.\"\n\nObviously this doesn't solve your charging problem but that's a whole different animal, obviously.",

It's only a few hours not a few days but TBH, if he gets a ticket from BCPD, it's a private university not a state school so if he doesn't pay it it's not like it's going to get reported to the RMV or anything. \n\nThere's also a men's hockey game today at 5pm so the gates to the Comm Ave garage will be open at least this evening.",

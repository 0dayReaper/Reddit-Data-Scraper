You don\u2019t have to take systems in order to understand the class, and the course material isn\u2019t hard, it\u2019s just very VERY boring. Additionally, there\u2019s no \u201ccoding\u201d, but the labs are done in Verilog (which is awful). Out of the three members in my lab group, Verilog only worked on one of our computers and the instructor, Biswas, didn\u2019t know how to resolve the issue, so it was a nightmare getting the labs done. \n\nTLDR: Don\u2019t take it",

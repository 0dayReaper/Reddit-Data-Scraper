    "postText": "Hi all. The endeavor program starts on January 11 and I'll be flying back to Boston early to attend it. Do we have to get a covid test before moving in? \n\nThe other thing I'm curious about what activities we'll do or events will happen. For those who were part of endeavor what exactly happens? Are most people from CSOM and more geared towards marketing and sales?",

Granted, a lot of the info is important and definitely relevant (speaking as a current masters student taking first year med school courses). If you don't use anki now, I would HIGHLY recommend starting to use it simply just to help you memorize content.\n\nEdit: that being said, I had Microbio Lab witb Kale and that was, I shit you not, one of my favorite classes at BC. I genuinely enjoyed going and learned extremely practical stuff.",

Basically he is the point man for Wall Street recruiting, so people take his class because alums who have taken his class email him internships and full time jobs which he then emails out to his classes. That being said, Barry is not the best teacher\u2014he teaches off slides, is not the best at explaining things, and can tend to overcomplicate things. If you don't want to work in \"high finance\", take an easier prof. But if you want to work in \"high finance\", then put up with Barry's class being hard (if you can't grind out Barry's class, you will not be able to grind it out in IB trust me) and reap the rewards of being in his class.",

The work isn't too hard; I read his workbooks for corporate finance &amp; investments cover to cover overnight for the midterm &amp; final and did pretty well. I would actually say he's relatively easy in some sense because the pool of possible problems is known, so it's more of a matter of reading &amp; understanding; the orange books give example problems and concise explanations. I've had teachers who have hundreds of slides/pages of material, wordy explanations that don't make sense, and/or possible test questions/answers aren't clear =&gt; big pain to study for tests.",

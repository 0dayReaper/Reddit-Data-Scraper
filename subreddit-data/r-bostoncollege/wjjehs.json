    "postText": "Hey Guys! I\u2019ll be coming to Boston College as an exchange student and plan on taking MKTG3156- Digital Marketing with Professor O'Hern, Matthew S. However I need the PDF syllabus for the course to get approval for it. I\u2019ve already done the syllabus search in Canvas and couldn\u2019t find it. I e-mailed the professor too but he\u2019s unresponsive. Could someone who has taken this course with him previously send me the PDF of the syllabus?",

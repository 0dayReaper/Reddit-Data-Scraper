In a class of 2300 that\u2019s about 115 people transferring out. Class of 25 was over enrolled this year so that # is even higher. If you can\u2019t tell I\u2019ve thought about this a lot haha. Idk if a lot of people came that usually wouldn\u2019t have (non-BC type people) and so the retention rate is lower or if it\u2019s around the usual 95% which is still several dozen people leaving. As someone who doesn\u2019t love BC but won\u2019t transfer and has close friends that are transferring (rip) this is all really interesting to think about.",

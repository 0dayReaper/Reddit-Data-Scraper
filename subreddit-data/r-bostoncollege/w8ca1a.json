Some clubs are competitive like RHA but generally speaking, if you go and make connections from early on you should be able to do whatever club you want. The only difficulty is the one you place on yourself(obviously your personality will matter in this regard). BC social life at least for me has been generally easy to mingle with.",

There\u2019s some groups which are incredibly selective and others that take everyone; you usually get a feel for that once you start going to the first meetings for some. My best advice is to see what seems interesting to you at the involvement fair and go to whatever first meetings you can",

I think there\u2019s also the First Year Service Program which is similar to 4Boston but isn\u2019t as competitive. \n\nJust because something is competitive, don\u2019t shy away from applying!",

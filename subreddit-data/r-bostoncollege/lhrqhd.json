Due to the lack of income from the football, basketball and hockey programs this season the school needs to find ways to make up the difference in revenue. Sending us home while taking our full tuition and housing money will be enough to fund this year\u2019s contribution to the secret Jesuit space program to convert the aliens. Gotta set the world on fire somehow",

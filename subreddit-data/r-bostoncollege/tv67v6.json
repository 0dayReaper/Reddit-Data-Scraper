CWRU is an awesome school and BC\u2019s advantage with rank/reputation is small. Probably small enough on paper not to pay 2x the price. That being said, I think you\u2019ll have an easier time getting jobs in big northeast cities (Boston, NY, probably even DC) with a degree from BC. \n\nHave you been admitted to the business school? BC has a good reputation in the finance world and I think this justifies the extra cost. Ditto for humanities and the social sciences but to a lesser extent. If you\u2019re looking to study something STEM-related I would probably pick CWRU. It\u2019s a tough call but it seems like you have two really great options.",

                    "comment": "I know there's a big price different here, but I would urge you to at least think more about your choice. OP wants to pursue medicine, where it would be smart to keep debt down since they're going to add additional debt on top of undergrad debt for med school. You are pursuing econ, where there are more varied opportunities. I'm not econ, but as far as I understand you can either pursue an academic route or work in business/consulting/finance type roles much like a finance major here might (CSOM gets more opportunities dangled in front of them but if you work hard to find opportunities econ majors do just as well). If you want an academic route then probably go SLO for the same reasons given to the pre-med OP.\n\n\nThat being said, I'm from CA and a graduating senior, so I can speak to the difference in career opportunities between SLO and BC. Comparing myself and the couple kids from my HS at BC to the kids from my HS at SLO, it's clear that us BC kids (sorry to sound like a prick here) are both smarter, more career-driven, and have much more opportunities than the SLO kids. The SLO kids were generally the type that messed around at HS (and that's why they're at SLO not a UC), but I would say BC kids are work hard play hard. I'm sure you could find smart kids at SLO given the size of the undergrad population, but I would say the average BC kid is way smarter than the average SLO kid. For reference, I also looked on Linkedin and most of the SLO kids are going into sales with one girl majoring in econ doing a master's at SLO. Meanwhile I'm majoring in finance, going to start in finance post-grad and the other kid from my HS at BC is majoring in CS and working on his startup.\n\n\nI think your reasoning around debt is sound, but basically you might reconsider since BC allows you access to high-paying jobs that are great career launching pads (think investment banking/consulting/some small private equity positions), plus a smarter and more driven student body overall. The earnings from one of these high-paying jobs will allow you to pay off your debt in a couple years, and you'll be thankful that you went to a better school that gave you better opportunities. That being said, I would consult with others around this\u2014don't just take my word for gospel.",

If finances were not an issue, I would choose BC over SLO any-day and I have no doubt that the students at BC are on average more intelligent and hardworking. My dad however, does not believe the difference is worth it, as someone who did not attend college, yet makes 300k a year based on his experience and intellect alone. College is what you make out of it, and I would love to go to the east coast but my dad will never pay for BC, so I understand your sentiment but its simply not an option for me. \n\nAnother point to note is I plan to major in Econ, but I also aim to get an MBA after, and if I put in the effort at SLO where I am surrounded by individuals who may not be as driven or intelligent as myself, I can stand out to a greater extent and transfer to a more prestigious school. In contrast BC does have awesome transfer rates because its right next to Harvard, MIT, etc, but as i previously mentioned, my parents will not fund BC.\n\nI suppose I\u2019m coping a bit, but I have to make do with what\u2019s available for myself in the present. Thankyou as well for the lengthy reply because it demonstrates genuine advice which I really appreciate :)",

College is what you make out of it, and I would love to go to the east coast but my dad will never pay for BC\n\n\nDon't mean to speak ill of your dad but geez gotta love the boomer mentality right? Maybe if your handshake is firm enough you can win your way to a $300k/yr paying job too. What boomers fail to realize is that the world has changed a lot since they were our age, maybe in their day you could finesse your way to success without a college degree but it's a lot rarer these days. You sound like you come from a family of means that would be able to support you paying full tuition at BC, but honestly I would absolutely despite my parents if they pulled something similar with me.\n\n\nMaybe you should tell him that career opportunities are much more numerous at BC. For example, google investment banking payscale and show him. If you were to go into banking, you could easily pay off all ~310k of your debt in 5 years. Tell him to think of college as an investment in oneself that will pay off throughout the rest of your career\u2014if BC gets you to a spot where you're making (minimum) 150k out of school, 300k 2-3 yrs out of school and SLO can't get you to that spot...then refusing to pay 50k more for 4 years seems like penny pinching.\n\n\n&gt; I also aim to get an MBA after\n\n\nMBAs are (a lot of the time, if the school is good enough) worth it over the course of your career. Much like I was saying above, an MBA is an investment that benefits you for the rest of your career, and while ~250k in debt is definitely a lot, the networks you form at your MBA are priceless when they come to help you down the line.\n\n\nHonestly, if you're committed to going into a high paying career after school, I would ask your parents to pay 35k and then take out the rest in loans...or hell, if they want to penny pinch so much, take out loans from your parents?",

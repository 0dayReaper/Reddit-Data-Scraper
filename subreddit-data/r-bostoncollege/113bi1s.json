Hard GPA cutoffs are a thing at a lot of companies in their hiring process. I\u2019ve recruited for companies with cutoffs anywhere between 3.2-3.7.\n\nNot saying folks shouldn\u2019t make the most of the classes that BC has to offer but there could be trade offs. Not sure if taking classes pass/fail is a thing anymore. Could be a nice balance if that\u2019s a possibility.",

I needed a course sophmore year and thought easy A to boost my science GPA.  Three weeks into the ridiculously easy math course,  a friend cautioned I might not get credit if I already had ap credit. \n\nSo I ask the math chair department head.  He said, \"Well, that's a problem,  sit in on my advanced calculus class (notably for math majors unbeknownst to me) for a week  and take the first test to reassess.\"\n\nSo I sit in on maybe two classes (taught by the dept head), for coursework I haven't had since high school, after I miss the first three weeks,  and sit for a test.  I just wanted to get demoted to the easy class, so admittedly, I didn't kill myself studying, but bacteriology and organic Chem didn't allow for much either. \n\nBomb the test.   Like bottom of the curve.  Talk to the dept head.  He says I'm SOL, he won't put me in the easy class.  Tells me I either stick it out or drop the class.  I foolishly didn't want a dropped class on my transcript, so I toughed it out.\n\nDid marginally better the second test and better still by the third, as I was playing catch-up all semester.  I start to get my math MOJO by the final.   In reviewing the material, I asked the dept head if he'd weigh my latter test scores higher than the first ones given my backstory and joining late into class.  Nope!, if I don't like it, drop the class.\n\nEnd up doing well and grading above the curve on the final (I got like a high B+, low A-) with a C+/B- average curve for the rest of the class.....again full of freaking math majors.  Motherf**cker true to his word, grades me precisely even across all the exams, so I get an effing C or C- for the year. \n\nDon't do it. \n\nAnd eff you past BC math dept head, who has long since moved onto another school because everyone effing hated you.  Crappiest professor at bc in his day.",

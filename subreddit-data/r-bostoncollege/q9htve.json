And we wish you the best with your application here and elsewhere.  \n  \nThat said - this page is run by students and alumni, and has no affiliation to the admissions office at all. If you have admissions-related questions, the [admissions office](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/admission/visit/contact-admission.html) has some awesome resources with both counselors as well as current students that can help you out.  \n  \nAdditionally, there's a whole subreddit for /r/chanceme questions that you can use if you want to post your specific situation for the general population to judge. **We'll be removing all chance-me-like questions, based on our [rule #5](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostoncollege/wiki/rules)**.  \n  \nI know this is a stressful time in your lives, but once these kinds of posts get popular, they wind up snowballing and overwhelming the sub.  \n  \nPlease, **do**, however, feel free to use this sub to ask questions or bring up discussions about life and experiences at BC!  \n  \nOK, that's it - good luck &amp; go Eags!",

I don't personally believe in prospective student chance-me's, because they're often wicked unreliable.  \n  \nCourse recs, we *did* stop moderating, because it was the only thing people have been using the sub for, which is why that's 95% of our front page these days. I still personally think they're dumb, because they're useless to like 99% of all people who see them and aren't indexed in any meaningfully searchable way for future reference, but, yeah other than being pretty much pointless they're not really doing any harm.",

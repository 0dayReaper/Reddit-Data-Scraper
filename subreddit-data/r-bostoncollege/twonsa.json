I was admitted for finance but am pretty unsure about if I want to go into investment banking, is finance still useful even if I don't pursue the IB route? Thanks !",

            "comment": "Finance and CS is very common. IS/bus analytics and CS is another common one with a lot of overlap. I\u2019m doing IS, business analytics, and CS and I\u2019ve come to find that IS is a little too non-technical for me but fun to study nonetheless. Ultimately it\u2019s just 4-5 classes per concentration so just do one that sounds cool to you unless you\u2019re dead set on a specific thing (IB, CPA, etc)",

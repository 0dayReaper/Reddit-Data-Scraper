    "postText": "Okay, so my college essay is about my asexuality. (Not the supplementals, but like, the common app essay.) Like, no way around it, its very clearly about my journey as a queer woman and redefining my definition of love after accepting my asexuality. The reason why this is okay for other schools is because I'm applying to non-religious/secular schools in liberal areas (The northeast). So prior to now, it hasn't really been a problem. \n\nHowever, I know Boston College is a Jesuit school. I'm a bit concerned whether talking about my sexuality is like an insta-dealbreaker or if it'll hurt my chances or what. If it does, then thats okay-- it sucks, but I understand that this essay is definitely not everyone's cup of tea. \n\nAlso I apologize in advance if I'm like totally off and mischaracterizing the school. Not my intent at all!! Just curious as to where I stand.",

            "comment": "Probably moot by now, but to respond to your concern: it's completely understandable, but it definitely won't hurt your chances! If anything, your bravery and honesty will work in your favor!\n\nI am a recent grad and LQBTQ+-identified. BC is a really supportive place\u2014the professors, 95%+ of the student body, and most of the staff/admin you might encounter in four years as an undergrad are overwhelmingly allies. They don't have a dedicated LGBTQ+ center or full-time support staff member, but they do have a retreat, support groups, lavender graduation, a very well-funded student org (the GLC), and a ton of resources available. (I can't speak directly about being asexual on campus, although I did have one out asexual friend and she seemed to have found community within the broader queer community).\n\nAnyway, the concern you have is not entirely unfounded in that the upper tier of the administration (and perhaps a good chunk of the board of trustees \\[i.e. rich donors\\]) don't necessarily see supporting queer folks as high of an institutional priority as other universities do, but then again, it is a Catholic university. So their values are their values. But the Jesuits are very concerned with supporting people as individuals and helping them to thrive. They won't try to convert you or impose their beliefs on you.\n\nThe Admissions team does not fall into this small subset of the upper administration though. They are definitely as liberal and open-minded as any other elite university's admissions team. So, I wouldn't worry about it. And if you are accepted, don't let it sway your decision. I felt at home as a queer student at BC, and though it's not perfect, it is nothing like the small-minded parochial Christian colleges that are out there.",

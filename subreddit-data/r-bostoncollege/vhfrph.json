    "postText": "Hello! Can anyone comment on the difficulty of Physics II with Calculus at BC. I am also wondering how extensively Calculus II is used in the course. My friend is hoping to take it with me but has only taken Calculus I. I think that u-sub and integration by parts are self-teachable but I am wondering how large of an emphasis mathematical derivations are in the course.\n\nAlso has anyone taken Physics II with Calculus in the Summer specifically with Christian Engelbrecht? I can't find any information on him (even his email) so I was hoping that someone has been in his class before. Thank you all so much!",

            "comment": "I have taken Physics II, not with Christian Engelbrecht though. Calculus is used extensively throughout the course. It seems that you have taken calc II so you will do fine. You should look into line/surface integrals and partial differentiation/gradients if you really want to be prepared (this is multi calc material). Your friend will have a difficult time but should be alright as well. Derivations are a big part of the course but the majority of the course will be applying the concepts you learn to specific problems (loop in a magnetic field, applying gauss' law to find e-field, etc.) The difficulty of the course comes not from the mathematics but from the ability to translate the physical concepts into their mathematical counterparts. \n\nNevertheless, I don't think anyone can ever be truly be prepared for physics II. Expect some late nights and occasional shedding of tears. It's all part of the physics experience.",

    "postText": "I know that many people on this thread are saying UGBC's and other student initiatives to encourage mask wearing and social distancing are not enough, and that we shouldn't go back at all. I, however, want nothing more than to enjoy my senior year at the Heights, in person and with my friends. That being said, it is pretty clear that off-campus parties overwhelmingly led to the spread of COVID at both UNC and Notre Dame.\n\nI know in previous years this would get you labelled a narc, or a killjoy, but I think we need to adopt a culture of calling the police whenever we hear an off-campus party or know about one happening. Sure, you might be killing the attendees' fun time, but the partiers are killing my and many other students only chance at a senior year.",

Regardless, a group of 20-30 friends renting an Airbnb is not nearly as much of a problem as hundreds of freshmen crowding some building on foster street. Stopping those kinds of parties is priority #1, and I believe that allowing some guests in dorms will mitigate them",

However, if students are going to party, 10-20 person gatherings pose a lower risk than 30-50 person groups.)",

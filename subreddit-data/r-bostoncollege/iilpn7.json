    "postText": "Hey everyone, I hope you\u2019re all adjusting as well as reasonably possible. I just got my negative test today, so I decided to make the trip over to the main campus to check things out. Here are a few observations:\n\n1. Six feet apart isn\u2019t happening and it won\u2019t ever happen. It doesn\u2019t help that it\u2019s impossible to always be six feet apart from people the way things are structured, but people also just aren\u2019t trying.\n2. I saw a bunch of people just walking around without masks on, even when there were a lot of people around.\n3. The dining halls make no sense. I feel like it defeats the purpose of social distancing when people can just sit and eat close together at the same table. Also, there was no disinfectant spray at the table where it was supposed to be, which is kind of weird.\n4. I heard a group of freshman talking about a party already, so that\u2019s fun.\n5. The shuttles to/from Newton campus are way too crowded and the windows aren\u2019t open.\n\nSorry if I come across as whiny, but I\u2019m less than reassured by my first impression. I can already see the cracks, but let\u2019s hope they\u2019re not enough to sink this ship!",

            "comment": "Valid concerns. I have some comments on them also as a freshman. 1. 6 feet is totally not able to happen. In orientation meetings today (I had three) they had hundreds of us meet in the same places and then we broke into our groups...but walking to and from was a joke. 2. I haven\u2019t seen anyone without masks yet...but I\u2019ve heard people say \u201cput your mask on\u201d and most people listen so just speak up. 3. Dining halls make no sense. It\u2019s really dumb...but what else can you do besides not allow seating indoors. I think this is inevitable bc idk how else we could do it. 4. The freshman have been gathering outside on upper (don\u2019t know about newton) at night from like 7-1. Doesn\u2019t seem to be any alcohol but who knows. I think people are just trying to meet each other. Let\u2019s just pray they\u2019re negative. 5. Newton busses are going to be a problem for sure. Again, it might be inevitable. \n\nCrossing our fingers everyone can stay!",

On-campus activity can be regulated enough by social norms and administration to prevent meaningful covid spread. Freshmen won\u2019t sink our ship, juniors on Foster street will",

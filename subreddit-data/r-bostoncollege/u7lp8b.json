    "postText": "I'm planning on doing a phd in the future (employed with a lot of extra time) - I would like to start getting research experience so it will help me with my admission applications. I live near BC and was wondering if it's usual there to have part time research assistant roles (for people not enrolled in BC)? I know a few universities do it - but not sure about BC.\n\nBackground: Data Science and Engineering",

            "comment": "This would be unusual. You could write to some professors in the department you\u2019d like to work in, but they may ignore you (especially at this time of year).\n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d ask for an informational interview. No pressure, just, \u201cHi, I\u2019m a member of the community, I\u2019m interested in what you do; could you spare some time to chat?\u201d Most would like to, but final exam week is the worst time to ask, so wait until after commencement.\n\nAfter that, ask how you can get involved in the discipline. This will vary by discipline; my discipline\u2019s primary learned society only begins opening to ABD PhD students, but some others have associated memberships that can get your foot in the door. (I\u2019m an associate member like this in another discipline because I work at our intersection). You may not be able to get research experience (that\u2019s typically reserved for students), but it\u2019s not completely out of the question if you\u2019re willing to do some volunteer work.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s also not crazy to not have research experience at the application stage. It\u2019s certainly helpful when applying, but not disqualifying if you lack it. Also, you may want to consider an intermediate masters degree; it\u2019s required in my field and I think it served me well.",

I tried applying to some schools for phd this year and I mostly got same feedback from professors about lacking research experience. All my previous work are with companies or startups (which I tried to shed a positive light on my admission applications but still not enough.) \n\nBut thanks for the advice! Appreciate it",

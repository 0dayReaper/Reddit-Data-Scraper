    "postText": "Recently Black students at BC created an instagram account where Black students and alumni could  share personal testimonies about some of the experiences they had dealing with racism at Boston College. No institution in America is immune from racsim, and the it is incumbent upon all of us to listen to Black voices and work to improve ourselves and our communities. A common thread among the posts was that Black students did not feel like their voices were being heard. Unfortunately Botson College's reaction to this was to untag the official school account from all the posts, demonstrating that its concern for its image is greater than its concern for its Black students and acknowledging and addressing their plight. YDS of BC ([https://www.instagram.com/ydsofbc/](https://www.instagram.com/ydsofbc/)) condemns this action by BC and stands with BC's Black students. These stories shoudl not be ignored or erased.\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/blackatbostoncollege/](https://www.instagram.com/blackatbostoncollege/)  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7q3emoxmu5751.png?width=962&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3c68f19ae69c8b98522869c7362e1aa5967c3f05\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1a0pzbj3v5751.png?width=542&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=60669b3fe24e7d7785a3f7f3fcab0cb14dd11ce3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y88bsv83v5751.png?width=520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=77db26c0ecbfe048d85d503f9743da2947c51b2c",

I'm not sure how much of it to believe, but very consistently students have complained about racial slurs from their peers, cultural insensitivity, as well as offensive comments from instructors. I remember the 2018 Welch Hall incident vividly, especially how (rightfully) angry people were at the time. \n\nAs a white student at BC, I want to say that these examples of racial hatred and/or ignorance are a stain upon our institution and we need to be doing more to support minority students at Boston College. I know for a fact that many people of color have felt uncomfortable at BC due to behavior like the kind described on these Instagram posts. Not only do we need to acknowledge that this problem exists at BC, we have to make sure that the culture at our college changes to reflect the values we profess as \"men and women for others.\"",

If you're not shown that there are problems and where and how they occur, you're not equipped to change anything. \n\nI went to the law school and I hope we see stories from all areas of the university. We all live in our own bubble and it helps to learn what happens to others that we don't see ourselves.",

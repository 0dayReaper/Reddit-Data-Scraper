    "postText": "I'm currently enrolled in Biochem 1, but have also heard that Biological Chemistry may be a better option. I only really care about MCAT material and what will help prepare me for that, but I also care about getting an A. I was deez at gen chem and orgo 1 and didn't do as well in orgo 2. I'm generally good at memorizing bio stuff. Which class would be more geared toward my goals.\n\nIf I do decide to drop Biochem 1 I'm planning to switch to calc ii, so I'm trying to figure out all of this before the new frosh snatch all the calc ii spots.\n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "If you didn't do well in orgo, you won't like Biochem I. As you could imagine, it's Biochemistry from a chemistry perspective (enzyme reaction mechanisms, stoichiometry at the start, etc.). However, it looks like Prof. Weerapana is teaching it next semester. I've heard only great things about her (NOT Chatterjee, the other guy who usually teaches it, who sucks). \n\nIf you opt to take Biological Chem (which I took), take it with Folker. He's a great professor as well and if you're willing to work very hard, you'll get an A with him. The same cannot be said for Michelle Meyer, the other person who teaches it.  \n\nDoesn't look like Folker is teaching it this year from what I see on the Spring and Fall course schedule. I'd say go with Weerapana and relay to her your concerns about orgo in office hours.\n\nAs for the MCAT, both courses are fine. You honestly end up re-teaching yourself the material anyways since the MCAT doesn't emphasize depth as much as a BC exam would.",

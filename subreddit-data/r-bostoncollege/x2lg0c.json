His tests are very difficult because he asks really niche questions and only covers like 5% of the material in the lectures on the test. That sounds great, but he doesn't tell you which 5% he's gonna cover so you have to study everything but that prevents you from going as deeply as he expects you to. I literally went to one of his TA's to ask what I needed to do to do better in the class and the guy told me, \"There's nothing more you can do. You're doing all you can.\" I don't love him as a professor but he's a nice enough dude.\n\nEdit: everything not anything",

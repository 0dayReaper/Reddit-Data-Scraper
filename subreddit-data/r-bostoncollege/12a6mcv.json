Would you be comfortable standing on that corner shouting their bs?\n\nAn All-American BC football player called out this type of racist  bs when no one was watching, even in the face of an authority figure that could have messed his life up.  \n\nThe world needs more guys like him.",

If your essay relates to anything BC values, especially community service, that\u2019s helpful- do a big service project or something like that. Also, most who got in this year were in the top 10% of their class. Good luck!!",

I never even did model un or any sort of stem competitions. I had some volunteering hours for key club and worked as a child care worker at my YMCA. My common app essay focused on my child care work experience. The BC essay topic at the time was about social justice literature, so I wrote about the novel \u2018Native Son\u2019 and some other bullshit about how it made me more sjw.\n\nNow I\u2019m a CS and math major which basically have nothing to do with how I presented myself on my app. \n\nCSOM is a lot more competitive. You will probably need to demonstrate some sort of leadership. They seem to really like varsity athletes for some reason.",

Basically I wanted to show them that I was personally interested in attending and curious about anything they could think of that would be helpful for me to apply! We talked about my scholastic interest and why I wanted to attend BC an their school in particular and they let me know what the application process would be like and what I should include along with my application!",

    "postText": "Maybe this is part of the reason the testing results weren't updated today?\n\nFrom the Boston Globe: (copied so y'all don't get paywalled)\n\n[https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/09/09/sports/covid-19-afflicts-bc-swim-dive-team/](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/09/09/sports/covid-19-afflicts-bc-swim-dive-team/)\n\nAt least 13 members of the Boston College women's and men's swimming and diving team have tested positive for COVID-19, causing the team to suspend practices, according to a person connected to the program.\n\nThe outbreak raises concerns about BC's decision to field athletic teams this fall, while many other colleges and universities in the region have chosen to cancel or postpone their schedules because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe BC athletic department acknowledged the cluster.\n\n\"\\`We can confirm that members of our swimming and diving team have tested positive for COVID-19,'' Jason Baum, the school's senior associate athletics director for communications, said. \\`\\`We have temporarily paused all team activities with the swimming and diving program. The student-athletes who tested positive are in isolation in accordance with university COVID-19 protocols.''\n\nThe number of infected students could increase as additional test results become available Thursday. BC's roster lists 41 swimmers and divers from 17 states and Canada.\n\nHow the team became exposed to the highly contagious virus was unclear. A small number of team members fell ill Monday. Positive test results rose steadily Tuesday and reached 13 by early Wednesday, according to the person connected to the program. The team has not practiced since Monday.\n\nBC is the only college or university in New England to field a football team this fall. To date, the team, whose schedule opens Sept. 19 against Duke in Durham, N.C., has had only one player test positive for COVID-19, in June, according to the school.\n\nBC now faces the challenge of containing the virus to protect the rest of the student body, including its big-budget football team, which receives about $30 million a year through its affiliation with the Atlantic Coast Conference.\n\nMany members of the swimming and diving team have been moved to a hotel to quarantine, the person connected to the program said.\n\nBC reported on its COVID-19 website that a total of 38 undergraduate students and two others at the school have tested positive for the pathogen, including 26 during the most recent week, Aug. 31 to Sept. 6. As of Tuesday, 30 undergraduate students were in isolation, the report stated. In all, the school had administered 22,239 tests through Tuesday, including 12,545 to undergraduates.\n\nBC declined to say how many students who have become infected with the virus are members of the school's sports teams, other than the one football player. In addition to the football team, BC's women's soccer, field hockey, and volleyball teams are preparing to play full ACC schedules this fall. Other programs, like swimming and diving, are holding workouts.\n\nBaum said BC has yet to develop a schedule for the swimming and diving teams. Many of the team's usual competitors, including Harvard, Dartmouth, and Tufts, are not competing this fall. Boston University has started practicing but has yet to make a schedule, and Northeastern has yet to determine if it will push back the start of its season, its representatives said.\n\nLast year, BC's swimming and diving teams opened their schedule on Sept. 21 with their annual Maroon vs. Gold meet.",

They've got the strategy down pat, I'm sure.\n\n\nI was happy for a second that home classes might protect incoming freshman and sophomore women from getting sexually assaulted within the  next few months just to have it swept under the rug.  I mean, its much harder to get away with raping someone if they're not passed out at a party or not drinking alcohol because they cant blame the roofies on  too much to drink.  I'm very curious to see any rape stats  from this semester , however under reported, just to see how much social distancing and rules against large parties has impacted sexual assault .\n\nGuess people will have to get laid the old fashioned way for a while.",

For Freshmen, Sophomores, and Juniors, it might give them a foothold they need to do better going forward even when the sports program starts back up.  Education builds on itself.  Every little bit helps.  Even one year of focused schoolwork can be extremely valuable.\n\nWe're really talking about three different things here:\n\n1. Whether taking a year off from college sports necessarily screws over the athletes.\n\n2. Whether student athletes are to blame for not getting the best education out of their college years.\n\n3. Whether the system is exploiting student athletes.\n\nNow, I was really only speaking to #1.  Since they're still students at Boston College, having college sports take a backseat for one or two semesters should still leave them with plenty to do with their time -- and it's really on BC to frame it that way to them.  You misread me when you thought I was blaming the students (I'm not), and we seem to be in agreement on the third point as this is clearly a much bigger problem.

I also walked back nothing about about their educations. They *are* getting a 4-year degree, regardless of how much focus they give their studies. Taking a year off from college sports would allow them to focus on their studies during that time, improving the overall value of the degree they're ostensibly working towards, but they're getting a degree either way.  The only question is how well they'll be able to apply that degree in their post-college life.  Three years of split attention and one year of focus is better than four years of split attention.\n\n&gt; I would say points 2 and 3 are inextricably linked. The system exploits them and their ability to get the best out of the education is limited as a consequence.\n\nI'm drawing a distinction between these points to clarify where the blame lies.

It's been proven that cognitive abilities aren't fully developed until 25. \n\nWhat the law defines as an \"adult\" is light years away from what an adult is mentally. Why do you think colleges all over the country are finding themselves in this issue in the first place? \n\nMany (not all) kids can't make the decision to not party and risk harming themselves + others.",

I went there undergrad, got waitlisted at the law school, sent a letter like that and got in off the waitlist a few weeks later.",

I think there\u2019s some sort of sheet that I filled out where you get your teachers to fill out what your grade is in the class at the moment and you have them sign it. I think you can ask BC about it. I didn\u2019t have final grades so I had teachers fill it out for me. There was also a space for them to leave a comment I remember too.",

    "postText": "Hi all! I recently moved to one of the graduate housing apartments on catalina ave, and I kinda need some help in getting myself settled in here. So here goes-\n\n1) Is the tap water safe to drink?\n\n2) Where can I get fresh and cheap produce near Catalina Ave, other than Trader Joes?\n\n3) I don't have a data plan for my phone yet, so I'm gonna do this (http://osxdaily.com/2012/01/05/enable-internet-sharing-mac-os-x/). Is this okay? I read some rules about IP sharing and how it's not allowed... I'm not very sure about this sort of stuff. I'm currently using Caltech Guest, but it's kinda weak.\n\n4) Lady at housing desk told me file sharing is strictly forbidden, so I have to quit torrenting I guess. How do you guys get your TV-fix? Netflix? Hulu? Any free sources to share?\n\n5) Since I'm only here for a few months I am looking for a cheap data plan for my phone, and I don't need call or text, just about 0.5-1gb of data a month. So far the quotes I got were around 30 to 40 dollars each month. Do you guys know where and how I can get a cheaper data plan?\n\n\nLastly, if anyone is selling pots, pans, and other kitchenware for cheap,  let me know! \n\nThanks in advance guys! Looking forward to having a great time here :)\n\nEdit:\n\nMore questions:\n\n\nWhere is the nearest and/or best Asian market to Catalina Ave?\n\nI've got a lot of euros and I want to change them to USD. Does anyone know where I can do that? I went to citibank today and they said most banks will only change it for me if I have an account with them. I don't really want to have an account.... well maybe, if necessity.\n\nWill I get a fine if I cycle on pedestrian pathways? Smaller roads, I can deal with. But the traffic on the more populated roads (eg Lake Ave, California Blvd) scare me.\n\nCan I pay cash on the buses? ",

Otherwise, Ralphs, Pavilion, Vons or the Pasadena Farmers Market.\n\nNetflix has the best selection, Amazon Prime is a good runner up.\n\nH2O wireless is a good one to check for cheap data plans. They use ATT's network, so the coverage is pretty good. I get 500mb and unlimited text/talk for $30 a month.\n",

However, I'm on foot for now, till I get a bike. So all the places you recommended are too far for me. Do you know of somewhere nearer to catalina ave? like a mom&amp;pop shop sort.\n\nThe guy at the store recommended h20 too, so I will probably get the $30 one. Gotta limit my data then ;)\n\n\n",

Otherwise you're bussing home with 10 lbs of potatoes you got for $2 which is sub ideal. 99 Ranch (maybe two-four miles east of campus) is another good grocery, where Super King has a lot of Eastern European fare 99 Ranch is Chinese with some other misc Asian thrown in.",

The Lake Ave Pavilions is a decent-enough grocery store and there are (or at least were, a few years ago) a bunch of reasonable restaurants nearby.\n\nA bike's not a bad option if you don't plan on hauling much back from the store.  It opens up the option of easily getting over to Old Town or Arroyo Pkwy.  That said, biking in and around Pasadena can be a terrifying experience.  I knew a bunch of fellow students who got hit by cars while on their bikes.\n\nBottom line is I guarantee you'll get more out of your time in Pasadena and LA with a car.  Rather than being stranded on an island in the middle of Pasadena, you'll have the option of driving to Arcadia for some Asian food, to the beach (if you have the time) or anywhere else you want to go.  LA's set up to be a car town, so owning a car there isn't a huge pain in the ass like it might be in other large cities.\n\nGood luck, and welcome to Tech.",

There is a location at Lake and Colorado. Otherwise, perhaps try the Caltech Credit Union.\n\nGetting by without a bank account sounds annoying, it is often much more convenient to use a debit card than cash.\n\nMetro buses and trains require a TAP card, you can buy one at the Caltech book store. Also, at the book store, you can buy a monthly Metro pass for your TAP card at a reduced rate ($50 instead of $75) or get $5 off a $20 TAP credit reload.\n\nARTS buses also take TAP, but I don't think they accept the monthly pass.  I've never ridden on Foothill Transit.\n\n",

There are a ton of Chinese grocery stores down in Alhambra/San Gabriel, and a Mitsuwa in Alhambra I think. Alternately, if you're near a metro station, you could take the Gold Line to Little Tokyo, one stop past Union Station.",

How hard is it relative to other majors? How much in depth do the classes go into? How are the professors? Etc. \n\nAny response is greatly appreciated, thanks!",

            "comment": "Physics BS holder here. It really depends. I'm not a fan of comparing it to other majors, as everyone has their own aptitude for things.\n\nLike all things at Caltech, physics will be taught at you at a breakneck, \"drink from the firehose\" pace. Nothing exemplifies this more than in junior year, where I took classes with first graduate physics students, taking a year of a frankly grueling pair of physics classes. This is generally the point that people who want a degree that is useful without getting a PhD switch to another major. Professors are, as usual, hit or miss, as teaching is not their primary job at Caltech. Most of the time, for academic help, you'll be talking with graduate students.\n\nPhysics is a combination of deeply theoretical, which will involve a lot of math, as well as some lab classes, as part of the degree requirements. But it leans more towards the theoretical, so I hope for your sake, you're pretty good at math.\n\nI asked this uncomfortable question in another thread, and I'll ask it here: Why do you want to do a physics degree? Are you pretty confident by the time you're done in 4 or 5 years, you'll be applying to graduate school for another 5-10 years of devoting yourself to the subject? I'm not saying you'll be unemployable, far from it, but it is a lot of effort and pain to go through for a degree that isn't particularly useful for your career without getting the requisite PhD.\n\nNot saying that you have to go for a degree that is commercially viable from the get go, either, but if you're going to spend 4 years on something, it's worth considering what your goals might be at this point.",

            "comment": "There are two types of physics major at Caltech. The first are the geniuses, who pass out of a bunch of classes and you just have no hope of comprehending just how smart they are as they breeze through classes, and end up having to ask them for help on... well... everything... 10 years down the line you'll see them announcing their professorship on Facebook at some top tier university. \n\nThe second are the average human being who loves physics and sticks with it anyways. Physics is a wonderful field and a lot of people just stay for the beauty and wonder of it. They end up getting passing but mediocre grades, struggling about as much as most Caltech students do. They don't have rediculous major requirements like Chem Es do, they do an apprioriate level of math. They have hard classes but not too many that are famous for utterly destroying your soul. They aren't busy enough and still get a decent social life and have a decent time. They graduate with no real plans on sticking to academia, and either get a cushy job in FinTech or bootcamp and become a data analyst.\n\nIf the 2nd path is an acceptable result for what you want to do AFTER college, and you really want your undergrad to be pursuing things you're passionate about, go for it.",

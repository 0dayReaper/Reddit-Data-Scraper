    "postText": "I have had this t-shirt from the Caltech student store for a while (http://www.bookstore.caltech.edu/catalogs/CatalogProductItems?Title=T-SHIRTS&amp;Sku=1*100765&amp;Source=GM&amp;Delc=Other%20Sizes%20or%20Colors%20Available).\n\nIt contains lots of things that are ... sad. Things like  \"sqrt(25)\", \"8^{1/3}\", and \"A(t) = A_0 (1 + r/m)^n\". For a while I tended to not wear this shirt, but as my other preferred shirts have fallen into disrepair, this one has made its way into my regular rotation.\n\nThat must now change. This past Friday I pointed out to a friend that it contains an absurd expression \"sqrt(-1) * (Pv / nR)\". Ah yes, the famous \"i * T\" ... expression. Well, that was not the entirety of the expression. See, right next to \"sqrt(-1) * (Pv / nR)\" was \"E / c^2\", and what happens when we subtitute \"m\" for \"E / c^2\"?\n\nWe get \"mit.\"\n\nAnd we don't get it just once. The expression \"(E/c^2) * sqrt(-1) *(Pv / nR)\" appears at least EIGHT TIMES on the shirt. Yes, that's right, the shirt says \"Caltech\" once in big bold letters, and it says subtly says \"MIT\" in at least 8 places. \n\nWho did this bamboozle? When did it happen? Perhaps we will never know. But suffice it to say that this shirt is no longer in my regular rotation of t-shirts. :/",

I always assumed that a designer had taken a shortcut and found pretty equations online and had accidentally added them to the first shirt and later again to the second. For me its a case of Hanlon's Razor though with a gag and laziness instead of malice and stupidity. ",

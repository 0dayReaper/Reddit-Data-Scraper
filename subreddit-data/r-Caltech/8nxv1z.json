    "postText": "So, long story short, CalTech is my dream school. It's the best school in the country for my planned major(astronomy), right near where I live, I love the culture... but the school is notoriously difficult to get into. I was wondering what my odds of getting in are, from anyone who might be able to help me on this.  \n  \nMy cumulative GPA is a 4.15 or so. It's slightly gone up throughout high school. I'm taking 10 APs throughout my 4 years, which has brought down my GPA a bit(APUSH is *hard*, man!) My SAT score was 1520(but I'm taking it a second time in August.) I got an 800 on the Math 2 subject test(haven't taken the Physics subject test yet.)  \n  \nI'm hoping what seals the deal is my extracurriculars. I'm on my school's academic decathlon and science bowl teams, and I'm the head of electronics for my FRC team. I was also in the NITARP program(the JPL student-teacher outreach program) back in 2016, and in early 2017 my team presented at the American Astronomical Society conference, where we presented our findings of 250 or so baby stars!  \n\nOverall, I feel like my academics are great, but not great for Caltech. I'm hoping my extracurriculars can push me over the top, what do you guys think?",

So you have a shot of getting in.\n\nHave back-up schools, of course.\n\nAlso majoring in astronomy is pretty much like majoring in physics.  In other words, if you're not crushing your Physics classes now, you may be in for a rude awakening.\n",

            "comment": "I think your stats are roughly as good as anybody else who gets in. If you can up the SAT by 50 points that could help. (This seems small, but honestly each little bit counts.) \n\nYour extracurriculars seem good; my main worry is a lack of leadership positions and national-level awards. For your application, I suggest emphasizing both the working-in-a-team aspect of them (collaboration is a big deal at Caltech!) and also what  you contributed individually and how you personally gained from / gave back to them. \n\nOverall you are qualified enough to get in, but there will be a huge luck factor. You can improve your odds by carefully tailoring your essays (and possibly rec letters too) so that it's clear that Caltech is the best fit for you, that you would not only succeed at Caltech but absolutely make the most out of the available opportunities, and that you would enrich the Caltech community. \n\nTo prepare for your essay you might find it helpful to compare Caltech to other schools like MIT, Berkeley, or Stanford and figure out what makes it stand apart.

As for the leadership bit, I\u2019m head of electronics on my FRC team, and I definitely plan to emphasize my leadership in my tutoring programs, which I just found out I may or may not end up taking over as the current head graduates.

                            "comment": "I got into Caltech back in 1999 without much leadership experience aside from being yearbook editor-in-chief, and I did not emphasize it in my essay. I didn't have any national-level awards in math or science, besides qualifying for the AIME one year, although I was a National Merit Finalist and an AP Scholar of some sort (I don't remeber the proper name). My math and science awards were in local or state-level contests based on test-taking. However, I had a higher GPA and a higher SAT score, and I'm a girl. \n\nOverall, I think you have a decent shot at getting into Caltech, especially if you increase your SAT score. You probably already know it, but graduating from Caltech is hard. There's a big gap between Caltech's core and AP-level material, or at least there used to be.\n",

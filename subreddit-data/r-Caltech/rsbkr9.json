It's a summer undergraduate research fellowship (SURF) that enables students of any and all majors (including students applying from other colleges) to work in a research lab at Caltech with a professor and their lab group. You can find more information here: [https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/surf](https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/surf)\n\nSince i'm sure that working with engineers and physicists on the world's leading gravitational wave observatory could prove interesting to a prospective physics major, you can also find LIGO-specific SURF information here: \n\n[https://labcit.ligo.caltech.edu/LIGO\\_web/students/SURF/](https://labcit.ligo.caltech.edu/LIGO_web/students/SURF/)",

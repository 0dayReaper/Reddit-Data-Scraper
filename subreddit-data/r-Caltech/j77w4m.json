No. I don't think Caltech admissions or hiring committees says: \"look, we can only admit 3 black students this year, so choose wisely\"\n\nBut what I am saying is that I believe there to be an exceptionally high level of implicit bias that casts a broad shadow over their practices. \n\nIn Ms. Sam's letter, she references how the \"naming committee\" basically became a discussion on \"should we really be doing this?\" And not focused on the actual task of renaming buildings and developing standards for how to rename them.",

If the latter, I doubt your sub 1% estimate is accurate, though no doubt it'll still be far lower than the population.\n\nAlso, numbers rarely speak for themselves. Context is extremely important. There is a very important distinction between a system with unequal outcomes and a system that actively seeks to obtain unequal outcomes.",

That's exactly what implicit bias is about -- people won't say they're racist, and yet due to implicit bias they routinely perform actions which are racially-bias. \n\nIt could be small, like checking a black persons ID at the grocery store to ensure its their CC they're using, or it could be big, like declining admission due to \"poor fit\" or \"concern over future performance\"...but it's still a form of racism.",

The idiotic way we allow the quality of schools to depend greatly on the wealth of the local area, combined with the way income inequality correlates strongly with race because of the influence of past racism ensures that.\n\nFor undergraduates at least, a totally unbiased Caltech admission process is necessarily going to produce few Black admissions because most of the bright young Black kids who would have qualified if they got the proper support and encouragement from a young age from the elementary and high schools do not get that support and encouragement, and never even reach the point of applying to a Caltech or MIT level school.\n\nCaltech could try to encourage those Black kids that did go to schools that recognized their potential and supported them to apply to Caltech. That's the approach it took to get from around 15% women undergraduates in the early '80s to the something like 45% it has now. They would find high school women who were outstanding in STEM, and send a professor to visit the family and pitch Caltech to them.\n\nIf the woman applied the application would be considered gender blind but by greatly raising the number of women who applied, the number who were admitted greatly went up.",

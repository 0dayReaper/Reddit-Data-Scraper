    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nSo yea, if this is the wrong place for this please take it down. \n\nBut anyway, I am moving to Pasadena soon to start a pre-PhD fellowship at CalTech working at the Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (Doing stuff with Palomar more specifically). I was hoping to find some PhD students who were looking for a roommate to fill a spot near CalTech. \n\nBit about me, as I said I'm an astrophysicist, I used to work at NASA, got my Masters at Queen Mary University of London. I am an avid climber (indoor and outdoor bouldering mostly but looking to get into lead and top roping).  \n\nIf you have anything or know someone who is looking I'd really appreciate getting in touch with them as this pre-PhD thing means I'm getting paid the first year PhD salary but with non of the perks of being a student.",

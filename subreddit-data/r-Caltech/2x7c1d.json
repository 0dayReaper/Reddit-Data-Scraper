(I managed to get into Right and Wrong this term from an off-campus location by clicking like a madman.) /u/msittig's advice still holds, except now you wait by your computer instead of by the mailboxes. Have your courses ready, keep refreshing, and once that button appears, click like your overachievements depend on it.\n\nSomeone told me REGIS crashes because of students using bots. I would consider this a mild violation of the honor code, but, eh. Registration seemed to be free of hangups this time around, as opposed to during the last *n* terms.\n\nThere's always the Add-Card strategy. This appears to work better for classes with large enrollment limits as opposed to the 15-student humanities courses.\n\nTL;DR - Be faster; be lucky; use Add Cards if it doesn't go your way.\n\n(This post's Helpfulness Rating: 0/10.)",

They would also do this to enroll in conflicted courses without getting a conflict card signed, by taking advantage of a bug that showed you to register for conflicting courses if you did so simultaneously eg in different browser windows. That needed to be done at a high request rate to work properly. This caused the servers to crash or more frequently just be really slow, causing students to coin it \"glitch day.\" After registration last term, a notice was sent out that anybody who did this or similar would be considered to violate the honor code. \n\nFor some strange, unidentifiable reason, glitch day went off without a hitch this term. Other than classes filing up quickly (which is to be expected) there were no issues (with the servers or otherwise) for once. ",

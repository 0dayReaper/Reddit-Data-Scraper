    "postText": "Hi, I'm going into my junior year at a public school in Pennsylvania. My school only offered two different AP classes to sophomores and I took AP Environmental Science. I received a B in the class and wasn't able to take the AP exam. Theoretically, if I took the exam this upcoming year and got a 5, would that dismiss the B and should I address it somewhere in my application? I'm taking the most rigorous course load my school offers while still holding on to orchestra as an extracurricular my junior year, but can I do more to increase my chances of admission? Thank you.",

Being involved in extracurriculars, research experience, good grades, great essays, good test scores (to a lesser degree)\u2014those all matter, but none of them will make or break your app on their own. I wasn\u2019t a straight A student in high school. I know several students at Tech who were straight B students. One B means just about nothing.",

See if a local college has any professors willing to take HS students as unpaid assistants (even if they\u2019re not exactly in your preferred field).\n\nCollege admissions is a crapshoot, though. Even the most qualified applicants routinely get rejected. Best thing you can do for yourself through the process is apply to a bunch of schools, and try not to fall in love with one until you are admitted (I know that\u2019s easier said than done)",

Caltech does not accept any other college-level classes. A placement test is given to incoming students to place them in different teaching groups of the required first year math class catered to their knowledge. Students who are exceptionally good at math could be able to place out; maybe at most 3 freshmen manage to do so, if any, each year. There are sometimes grad students who have to take Caltech undergrad classes in their subject after matriculation.",

On the other hand, if it\u2019s additional courses just for fun (like maybe a discrete math course that the high school almost certainly wouldn\u2019t have) on top of the regular calculus or similar courses at the high school, then you\u2019d probably want to weigh the time commitment and the passion for math more carefully. \n\nCourses like this can help your prospects with college applications, but aren\u2019t necessarily worth tons of extra time and stress.",

I wouldn't want to take that class totally by myself. The others don't sound too bad, difeq is kinda boring but not that hard, linal is pretty straightforward, and calc IV is what, multivariable? I wouldn't be thrown by advanced-sounding names for any of these, he should be fine in them, but analysis does in fact totally suck. He should definitely have some form of study group, either online or in the class, for that one.",

It's certainly not necessary to do all of these courses now, but if your son is really passionate about math and doesn't have too heavy of a high school courseload or other commitments, then that could be fine enough. \n\nOn the other hand, he might want to consider if there's any activities that the high school offers that a college might not. For example, I did four years of regular band, marching band, and jazz band at my high school. Caltech doesn't have a marching band and I don't have the time needed to practice for their jazz band, so I'm just doing the regular band at Caltech. (This problem is also a bit Caltech-specific, larger universities tend to have everything high schools offer and more). Also consider that trying things out earlier can be better, as joining a new club in college can be a bit more difficult if people have years of high school experience (see Quiz Bowl, Theatre, Debate, or similar). \n\nI certainly could have dedicated more of my time to advanced courses in high school, but extracurriculars made it a much more fun experience.",

Seconding the other commenter that it wouldn\u2019t automatically place him out of Caltech\u2019s equivalent math courses; however, I appreciated that I did it anyways because it made some of my math courses at Tech much easier than they would otherwise have been.

I would especially recommend taking some proof-based classes, since almost all Caltech math classes are proof-based and trip up a lot of freshmen who have never been exposed to the style of thinking.\n\nHowever, it's ultimately not necessary. I completed my HS's math curriculum, culminating in AP Calc B/C and AP Stats my senior year. Got a 5 in Calc and a 4 in Stats. The SAT II Subject test in Math is important, with the average at Caltech being an 800 I think, so that's a pretty important one to nail (although one of my classmates got a 730 or so and still got in). I would say the average person at tech goes through something like this, so your son is ahead of the curve!\n\nUltimately the most important thing is that your son displays a real love for whatever field he intends to go into. Caltech can be really brutal and, if you're not committed to your major, it can be easy to lose motivation and interest in it (lots of people end up switching to something like finance or computer science). Taking college-level classes is a great strategy for showing this commitment, but so is something like setting up a tutoring program at his HS/in your local area. \n\nBest of luck with the rest of HS and the application process!!",

    "postText": "I'm an undergrad at a large state school right now with a really good research program. I've pretty much spent the last two years here upset about not getting into Caltech, because everything I've heard about it sounds almost too good to be true (well, aside from the workload). Honor code, very student-driven university/dorms, people who are excited to talk about science to name a few.\n\nI'm wondering if there is anything special about the culture of the grad school at Caltech, or if it's really just your average research school once you get out of undergrad. I like the location of my university a lot better, and for research it has everything I need, but I'm just concerned about how much fun I would have in the process.",

            "comment": "The graduate student experience at any top-tier university is very different from the undergraduate student experience.  And, the graduate student experience is more uniform across schools.  You would need to visit your department of interest and your research group(s) of interest to find out if the environment and the work is a good match.  The undergraduate experience at a university provides much less relevant insight, and this holds true at Caltech and anywhere else.\n\nHaving said that, there is huge value in changing your environment when heading to grad school.  It is very easy to get stuck in old habits and expectations without even realizing it if you stay in the same place, and success in grad school requires a change of habits and expectations.",

It's a unique culture, but it's undergrad-only.\n\nGrad students have their research groups, their project and their adviser.  It's entirely possible to have fun as a grad student at Caltech, but you need to choose these three things wisely to make it happen. \n \nThere are lots of reasons to go to grad school at Caltech -- access to incredible resources, top tier research, an advanced degree from arguably the world's top university -- but looking for the Caltech undergrad experience isn't one.",

    "postText": "I am looking for a Techer either studying EE or with EE interests to do various electronics odds-and-ends tasks. It could be anywhere from doing some wire crimping and soldering, assembling PCBA's into housings, doing some datasheet lookups and creating footprints for Altium, or even checking/creating schematic capture and PCB layout work.\n\nIf you are interested in any or all of the above tasks, please drop me a line with what work interests you, your general background so that I can get a feel for you as a candidate, and your hourly rate that you'd like to ask.\n\nWe have a shop in Pasadena near PCC. Most of the work you can do at your place, and I can bring the material to you as needed, so you don't have to have your own transportation.\n\nIf you also do 3D CAD modeling and/or 3D printing; or have an interest in that, please let me know as well.\n\nIf you have a friend that might be suitable, please pass this on to him/her!\n\nThanks!\n\nJoseph B.S.

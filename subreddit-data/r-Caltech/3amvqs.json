    "postText": "On a very last minute trip I just came in from Pittsburgh to check out LA and Pasadena. I've also been interested in the HSS social science PhD program for awhile now and was wondering if I could buy someone a coffee/drink/etc to hear about it first hand. Unfortunately, the school doesn't talk to anyone about it until they've already been accepted. \n\nMy primary interest is in game and decision theory, specifically in regards to counterterrorism and anti-violence applications. I already have my MA and a professional background in emergency management and intelligence/counterterrorism.\n\nI'm thinking I'll be in the area this Tuesday the 23rd during the day, so if anyone is bored and wants to meet up please feel free to let me know!",

    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am a GALCIT Ph.D. applicant and current Curiosity Mars rover operator. I figured I'd put this post out there to see if there were any current grad students that would be willing to answer some questions for me. I would love to talk to someone with experience with space technology research, the CAST center, and/or the space engineering degree, but I'm certainly not picky and would be happy to hear from anybody in the department. Please send me a DM if you are willing to help! I'd be happy to order you a pizza in exchange for your time.\n\nThanks everyone, and stay safe out there.",

Anyone who tries to tell you something certain one way or the other is wrong.\n\nFor whatever it\u2019s worth, though, my profile was very similar to yours when I was admitted",

I was a bit worried because I got a couple Bs freshman semester, I used to be very lazy and procrastinate a ton, but after winter break I whipped myself into shape and started to work hard. I also did not do any non academic related extra curriculars, as STEM fields and politics are my greatest passion extracurricular wise so yeah",

The rest of your application (essays, recs, etc) will be the deciding factor. Caltech presumably gets many more qualified applicants than they have spots available, so you'll likely have to stand out from the crowd or distinguish yourself in some way. There's still time until you apply (assuming you're applying next year), so keep building up your passion for STEM/physics and you stand a pretty good chance. ",

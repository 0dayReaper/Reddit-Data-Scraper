    "postText": "This isn't an admissions question, but rather a knowledge prerequisite question. I've heard that Caltech's introductory chemistry course is pretty difficult, and most people have an AP Chemistry (or equivalent) background going in. I'm applying this year, but I'm a bit worried because I haven't taken chemistry at the AP Chem level. How required is AP Chem for success at Caltech? Would it be worth to somehow self-study it myself, or is Ch 1 ab more or less self-contained? For reference, I'm an intended physics major.",

            "comment": "Over 20 years ago, I remember my Ch1a prof saying on the first day of class that they were going to cover all the material from AP Chemistry during the first week of lecture. \"If you took AP Chemistry in high school, you'll have an advantage on the first homework set. If you didn't, you can ask for help from your friends who did. Next week, you'll be on a level playing field, because we'll start covering topics that aren't part of the AP Chemistry curriculum.\"\n\nIt's freshman year, so it's pass/fail. I wouldn't stress about it. Study the AP Chemistry material if you're interested in it. If you'd rather spend your time getting a leg up in physics, do that instead.\n\nMy biggest regret in terms of preparation was blowing off senior year calculus in high school, because, when I was there, many classes at Caltech involved doing lots of mathematical calculation (\"grungy algebra and calculus\"), and my poor mastery of integration techniques (integration by parts, integration by substitution, etc.) really made my life harder than it needed to be. My impression was that physics majors had to do even more math like that in their classes.",

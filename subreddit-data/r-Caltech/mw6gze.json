    "postText": "I am coming into Caltech undergrad with a little CS experience and AP Calculus BC (which i took a few years ago and have since partially forgotten). However, I have always loved the beauty of math and mathematical modeling, and so am interested in the math+cs or ACM majors. \n\nAre the math programs (especially upper level courses) at Caltech geared towards  USAMO type math prodigies with lots of theory experience, or will there be some support for someone like me with little background beyond the high school level?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Caltech math classes are intense for anybody, but it is true they're harder for people with less experience with higher level math. However, there are plenty of people with your kind of background who went on to be successful math majors. Caltech won't hold your hand, but the resources are there for you to get up to speed if you work hard and care about what you're learning. \n\nSome resources: \n\n* **Take Ma 0 in the summer.** This will introduce you to rigorous proofwriting, an essential skill for succeeding in pure math classes. It doesn't give grades or credit so you can purely use it to learn what you need to do well in the fall.\n* **For Ma 1a, make use of TAs, tutors, study sessions, and peer study groups.** Building a solid foundation will help you later on for both math and ACM majors. \n* **If you want to explore pure math, take Ma 5a as a frosh.** Ma 5a is an introductory class in abstract algebra. It's tough if you haven't taken a proof-based course before, but it is a great way to learn what pure math is all about and whether it's something you want to study. (The registrar will assign you a schedule for the fall but you can \"drop\" a class and \"add\" Ma 5a instead\u2014this is totally allowed and encouraged and will not impact your transcript in any way) \n\nFor more information about freshmen-level math classes see [https://pma.divisions.caltech.edu/research-and-academics/mathematics/math-undergraduate-studies/information-for-freshmen/course-information-for-freshmen](https://pma.divisions.caltech.edu/research-and-academics/mathematics/math-undergraduate-studies/information-for-freshmen/course-information-for-freshmen)\n\nIn terms of math culture, there are some but not many USAMO type math majors at Caltech. The culture is more focused on research. You will fit in if you take math classes with the other math majors and enjoy math.\n\nFor ACM and CS, Ma 6a could be a good choice. You can also take ACM 11 third term, which is another good introductory class.",

            "comment": "/u/literally_mental's post is really good but I have one other piece of advice which is to spend some time over the summer reading some textbooks! I have two specific recommendations:\n\n* [Dummit &amp; Foote, the ma5 book](https://www.amazon.com/Abstract-Algebra-3rd-David-Dummit/dp/0471433349)\n* [Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Sipser/dp/8131525295), the CS21 book when I was an undergrad, dunno if it's still used (this is a later edition than I read though) - this is a CS book moreso than math I guess but pretty similar idea.\n\nIf you're struggling with them that's ok! Getting used to reading dense, symbolic notation is kind of the point. You'll sort of feel like you're drowning. [Detexify](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) can help you figure out what symbols mean by giving you something to google if you get stuck. And eventually you'll reach a tipping point where you understand enough of the random notation that you understand most of what it's saying, at that point you can start over if you want and you should start having a lot more fun :)",

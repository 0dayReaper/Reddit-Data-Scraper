    "postText": "So I am an incoming freshman and I have a friend who will be going to Northeastern in Boston. I know that it is possible to do SURF outside of Caltech if it is approved and so I was wondering how feasible it would be to SURF at MIT during the summer so that I could share a residence with my friend.",

            "comment": "The #1 population that gets rejected from SURFs are freshmen who set up research outside of Caltech that isn't supported well enough by the other professor. Since there is a greater burden upon the professors at other universities, there is more scrutiny for those SURFs. \n\nSo, it's totally possible, it's just a lot less secure than trying to get a SURF on campus freshman year.",

            "comment": "I did an off-campus SURF as a frosh. There was a lunch meeting where someone from the SURF office went over our funding details. I think in about half of the cases, the SURF office paid the whole stipend, and in the other half of the cases, the SURF office paid half or nothing. It depends on the availability of funds and if the SURF office thinks your mentor should be able to pay the other half. For example, I've heard that the SURF office often covers the entire stipend for math SURFs, since math profs typically don't have large amounts of funding lying around. However, in other fields, I wouldn't be optimistic about the SURF office paying for everything. Since you're an incoming frosh, you'll have lots of opportunities to talk about this with upperclassmen who did research in your field once you're on campus. They'll probably have more specific advice.",

    "postText": "I'm planning to attend community college and I'm trying to prepare myself for the Caltech transfer exam. I recently graduated high school with a 4.0 uw and I took several AP courses and exams. I'm aware of the examination resources provided on the website but I wanted to know any tools or resources that could further prepare me for the exam. I was thinking of combining the recommended textbooks with MIT OpenCourseWare. I'm open to any suggestions or feedback on what I'm trying to do along with any other recommendations.",

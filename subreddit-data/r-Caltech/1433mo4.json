    "postText": "Firstly, I apologise for making this post, but I've thoroughly lurked this sub for a while now and have been unable to find anything definitive on this situation.\n\nI'm an Australian undergrad student with an interest in Robotics, looking to apply to Caltech for postgrad in \\~2 years time. I'm currently studying mechatronics and robotics at a relatively no-name Australian institution (albeit an institution who's main focus is robotics), QUT.\n\nI'm looking to go to Caltech as there seems to be some very cool research into bipedal robotics, as well as cool chaotic control systems research (haven't decided exactly where I'd be aiming for). My current university has a major focus on robotics in industrial use, which I don't care for.\n\nMy concerns are the following:\n\n* Given the no-name prestige my current school holds, do I even have a shot? I understand that, at the very least, it will diminish the probability of me getting in, but by how much I haven't the slightest.\n* On the applications page for the postgrad, it says not to give your GPA if you've studied undergrad outside of the U.S.. Is this to imply that entry will then be solely determined by research experience? \n* Currently, applicants aren't required to complete a GRE. Is this subject to change in the coming years?\n* As previously mentioned, I'm studying Mechatronics. This, to my understanding, isn't a popular/wide-spread major in the U.S.. Will this have any impact on my application?\n\nThank you in advance for any help you can offer.",

The most important things for your app are recommendation letters, research experience, and statement of purpose - these are the main contributing factors to your app! I highly doubt the gre will be reintroduced- most schools are phasing it out :)\nPeople know what mechatronics is, I wouldn\u2019t worry about that at all. I would check out the controls and dynamical systems (cds) program here. Good luck!",

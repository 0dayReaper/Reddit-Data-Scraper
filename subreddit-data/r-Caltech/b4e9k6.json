    "postText": "Hi there! \n\nI'm a recently admitted Prefrosh who's looking to major in either ChemE or BioE. I was wondering if I could receive some advice on which to pick.\n\nMy goal is to develop and implement a more effective drug delivery system using nanorobotics; essentially tapping into the work of Dr. Qian and others and applying it to therapeutics. To do this I'd like to do research during the school year every year.\n\nI'm struggling to pick between these majors because there are few cons to each of them from my perspective:\n\nCons of BioE:\n- pays a lot less for just a undergrad degree, which is relevant to me because I need to pay down 80k of student loan debt between undergrad and getting a PhD. A lower paying job means more years between undergrad and PhD.\n- Maybe be harder to get a job in the pharmaceutical industry between undergrad and PhD.\n\nCons of ChemE:\n- I have to take a few courses Im not personally interested in.\n- the courseload for ChemE is far more extensive, meaning that I'd have to take at least 5 courses every term for every term in my four years. I worry that this will impede my ability to get meaningful research done during the year. \n\nI know this is a long post so I appreciate any advice! Hopefully someone will correct a misunderstanding I might have in my cons list, or perhaps suggest an optional way forward. \n\nthanks! \n\n",

There's plenty of time for you to figure it out once you get here (I don't think the current freshman have even declared yet), especially since you already know what research you hopefully want to go into. \n\nIn either case, there's a ton of incredible work in that field that's just starting up at Caltech - if I had to redo my time here, I would definitely be trying to get research in BioE, where some of the newest and best work at Tech is really happening in my opinion.",

I took research units in the Fall, along with 4 science classes, and I struggled to find the time to put into lab. From what my mentor says, I\u2019m not alone. Doing something like taking 5 classes and trying to meaningfully work towards a research paper would probably stretch you to your limit, and it sounds like a good way to burn out. \n\nThat said, if I was just trying to fulfill graduation requirements (rather than taking every course that excites me), I think that BioE is quite reasonable and would allow you to research. \n\nYou have some time. Freshman year is the same for both majors, so sign up for both pizza courses. Satisfy intro Bio with Bi1x, which is a fantastic introduction to BioE. ",

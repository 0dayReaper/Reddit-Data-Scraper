    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI want to apply to the CNS PhD for the next year. I have a Master's degree in CS, a bachelor in Mathematics, and a bachelor in Computer Engineering. I have published two papers about Deep Learning: one in CVPR and the other at a national conference. Additionally, I expect to publish one paper about Quantum Computing this year.\n\nI am interested in this program as I want something about Neurmorphic Computing or Neuroinspired AI and I have seen that this program suits my needs (first learning about Neurosciences and then doing the research).\n\nConsidering what I have done, do I have good chances at entering the program? Or what can I do to maximize my chances? Lastly, does anybody here is in this program?\n\nThank you very much.",

    "postText": "Hi there, I'm Harel. If you're not sure how to pronounce that, don't worry; most people can't. I'm a prefrosh, which means I don't know much about Caltech past what I've seen on tour and what I've obsessively read from the university website and information packets. I enjoy sushi, singing, and reading...... physics textbooks. Even though I won't be on campus for another several months, I feel like more of a Caltech student than one at my high school (which isn't hard because I haven't attended classes there for 2 years). How's everyone doing?",

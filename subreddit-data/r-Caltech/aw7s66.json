    "postText": "I plan a self-guided tour of the Caltech campus. I use Google Maps Street View to plan my route. There's a small part of the route that isn't available on Google Maps. Could you please help me out?\n\nAcross the street from the main entrance to the Sherman-Fairchild library there are gates leading to a court.\n\n1. Are these gates normally open?  \n2. Is it possible for a visitor to access this court by entering the Dabney Hall from the other side (the side that faces the Parsons-Gates Hall of Administration)?  \n3. What times is the Dabney Hall open for visitors, so I can make this shortcut?",

    "postText": "Hello! I am currently an aerospace engineering major going into my second year of university (Not at Caltech). I have had my eyes on Caltech as a graduate school that I would like to attend possibly in the future. Specifically, I want to apply to either the Aeronautics or Space Engineering degree program under GALCIT. Can anyone shed some light on what it takes to get into the program?\n\nAny information would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "I went to graduate school in the Mechanical and Civil department but I did my research with a GALCIT professor. I think the question of what it takes to get into graduate school is generally a hard one to answer. Everyone is coming from a different background and the goal shouldn't be to be someone you're not, but to be the best you can be and then highlight that. \n\nI can make a few general statements though. \n\n* Undergraduate research is really helpful - see if you can volunteer in a lab at your university to get some experience and a good letter of recommendation. You can also apply to be a SURF student (summer undergraduate researcher) at Caltech. SURF is a great way to get a foot in the door. \n* When you are applying to graduate school, it is a good idea to email the professor(s) you're interested in directly expressing interest in their lab. Choose a number of faculty who you are genuinely interested in and email them. Be specific and demonstrate that you have looked at some of their papers and their website. They may or may not respond, but either way it'll be a good way to have your name in their head. The professors decide who gets admitted to their department for graduate school, so you want them to know who you are. \n* Study for the GRE. The vocab is really hard, and even though really the GRE doesn't matter, it doesn't look good to have a bad score. It's worth it to make some vocab flashcards, learn good test taking strategies out of a GRE prep book, and give yourself time to take it more than once.\n* Be passionate and express that passion clearly. Professors want someone excited and thoughtful in their lab. You want to have an area of focus you're interested in (fluids, solids, experiments vs computations, controls, robotics, etc) but within that field you want to be flexible and be excited about whatever they throw your way.\n\nI'm happy to answer more questions. Good luck!",

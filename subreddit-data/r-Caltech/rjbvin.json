            "comment": "It's really worth stressing that this subreddit is really not very active or engaged with by most of campus, so a lot of what bleeds over to here are the big &amp; bad things. The admissions and class/house discords (i.e. actually just having some conversations with current students) will give you a much better picture than skimming this subreddit.\n\n\nEdit: to explain a bit why the subreddit looks negative -\n\nThe academics are *hard* and rigorous even compared to most other top-tier schools and that drives a lot of how the rest of UG life is. If you do well in a trial-by-fire environment then you can get a lot out of it, but it also burns a lot of people out pretty badly and I can't really omit that word of warning. It will almost certainly be harder and different by a long shot than anything you've ever done. Classes are generally very theoretical/abstract so you walk away with a fantastic grounding in your field, but might have to learn some of the lower level practical stuff on your own time. So academics are definitely a big positive but with a \"be careful what you wish for\" disclaimer. Because of your comment I want to throw in here that a lot of people feel imposter syndrome, but if you got in you are capable of doing 'tech.\n\nAs a result of the grueling academic life, a lot of people don't really have time for super in-depth clubs etc. There are clubs but some are more active than others &amp; some people find more time for them than others (you can definitely scrape out a space for yourself if ya want &amp; have time!). Most of UG life instead revolves around the House system which is similar to but not exactly (esp. it can be a looot less toxic than the former imho) combination of greek life/harry potter houses. Prefrosh weekend/rotation will give you a better sense of the system than I can cram in a reddit comment :p You'll meet some of the smartest, most passionate people on the planet and have the opportunity to collaborate and/or get up to some crazy shenanigans with them in your house(s), but also just have a good grounded base to return to and just chill and chat in a common room after those killer sets.\n\nI'd rank both the academics and culture as extremely strong reasons to go to 'tech. They come with caveats because of the difficulty and peculiarity of the place but if it's a good fit for you then they're amazing.\n\nI actually think the main disadvantage of 'tech is the administrative culture/control has been getting worse in recent years. It's hard to diagnose exactly but I think there are too many administrators, most of whom transferred to 'tech from much larger \"peer institutions\" and don't understand student life or academics here at all (and mostly don't bother to try) but don't have much else to do except fuck around with student life via pet projects/initiatives (that great student-faculty ratio also means a high student-admin ratio which isn't so positive). Well, really there's plenty of good they could be doing to actually support students at one of the hardest schools in the world, but that's not flashy enough or else is too much actual work. They hire layers of more administrators under them to do the important stuff their job was supposed to be while they do flashy projects but then veto all the subordinate decisions cuz they don't know whats going on. This cycle repeats for several layers of admin and makes hell for the few too-badly stretched people in student government. Meddling regularly wreaks havoc socially and can be destabilizing AF when you're mostly just trying to make it through hard academics.\n\nBitterness about this last point and about burnout are what bleeds over into this subreddit a lot but there's a lot more to life at tech than that.",

The fearlessness stemmed from the experience of having to solve the toughest open-ended problems with a high amount of rigor. Through the classes, I was able to see connections between theoretical physics and mathematics alongside practical engineering. \n\nOther graduates know that and will see that in you implicitly.",

The first term was painful and filled with struggles, but at the end of the day I truly do feel that my logical thinking ability has increased exponentially and am one step closer to being a scientist. The Intro to Physics class also has actual professors as TAs (one of them being the author of the textbook we used), and they\u2019re very easy to talk to. If you\u2019re interested in research, there really are countless opportunities even if you have no related background at all.

Ik that seems silly to say but I welcome you to try and reach out to people who you can confirm are Caltech.  It also changes and of course the Reddit isn't everyone either.\n\nHaving said that, it's not wrong to assume Caltech is fucking tough.  For reference, the passing grade for the entry math course, Ma1a, was like 28%.  That immediately shows you how difficult it can be.  But in a flip of a coin (or perhaps a double edged sword) it also shows you something else:  Caltech isn't trying to make you fail--it wants you to succeed. \n\nCaltech will really push yourself to develop academically, to an extent that you probably won't get basically anywhere else.  At times it'll really suck, there'll be times where you have doubts and regrets about choosing it.  But I think it's accurate to say that you won't feel this for long, because by the end of it you'll agree you never could be anywhere else and even that you wouldn't go to any other school.\n\nI won't say anything about skills specifically because I think Caltech's name speaks for itself in that area.  As for long term benefits *unqiue to Caltech* (I could speak for hours about the community and other common ones), it puts you on good early terms with NASA (JPL), if that's something you're interested in, and it'll set you up to do research: something that every grad school wants.  I'd also say that the theoretical approach that Caltech emphasizes is something that in particular made me go to Caltech, as it teaches you how to think abstractly and teaches you better ways of learning (even on the unknown frontier). \n\nAs for college life, another thing I could go on about for hours.  Personally I think I'm one of the more quiet people and am not in a House, but Caltech's house life really isn't like any other if that's your sort of thing, and for a lot of people you'll find somewhere you'll really enjoy socially.  Find the Wikipedia pages for Caltech's housing if your curious.  I think the page about the MIT-Caltech Prank Rivalry is also really good.\n\n  I'm pretty sure they've also put the Admissions Discord on the admissions page so make sure to join that, you'll find lots of people willing to answer questions and can meet some of your future (hopefully :) ) classmates!",

Although what you are working on is not directly what you would be doing at work, you learn a lot about how to work with others and have a team mentality, not a competitive mentality that a lot of other colleges and almost all high schools promote. Another positive of the core is that more senior classes get ramped up quickly instead of wasting your time since you can assume everybody in the class has taken linear algebra, statistics, etc., so it doesn't waste your time.",

I really like the house system because it allows you to interact with upperclassmen a lot more than you would at schools not like Caltech. Also you get pretty close to people really fast because there are a lot of house bonding activities. It\u2019s also really small so you get all the benefits from a small school. It\u2019s almost funny how easy it is to do research here. A lot of students at other schools don\u2019t get opportunities until their junior or senior years whereas Caltech students get them as early as frosh year. The social scene is a little dead on campus for obvious reasons (everyone is working). But I\u2019d say that I have really great close friends that I spend a lot of time with. I do really love this school because the people here are really nice and welcoming. In my experience there isn\u2019t a lot of drama or anything because everyone is just so friendly. There also isnt much toxicity at all because we\u2019re all suffering together, so we try to support each other as much as possible. In regards to things to do over the summer, Caltech\u2019s SURF program is ez money. A lot of students also go into industry. Now the bad parts, this school absolutely drains you from its workload. You won\u2019t have any time to do anything else other than work. It\u2019s really absurd and annoying how much work there is, all for no reason. Also the core curriculum is really poorly taught and there are a lot of times when I really just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. The food here also isn\u2019t spectacular. The pizza and burgers are sometimes decent, but you\u2019ll get tired of a lot of the food really fast. But hey, you suffer alongside many others who understand your pain. So that makes it a lot more bearable. Edit: a lot of people think that caltech students are social recluses but i can promise you that\u2019s not the case. there are many people here that are very social and very outgoing. sometimes though, we\u2019re all just so tired from work that our social battery runs out too",

The social life is bleak, there is basically no college town  and everything near by is built for rich gen Xers, it's smaller than most high schools so get ready for intense petty drama, community orgs are relatively non-existent besides the weird housing system, the administration really controls your life (dining plan and on campus housing for basically all 4 years), class sizes are smaller but teaching quality isn't much better than elsewhere (research ability =/= teaching ability), you'll work crazy hard but there's not much of a difference between caltech/berkeley/stanford/mit/michigan to an industry recruiter (who might think you went to cal poly slo), tiny alumni org that is really spread out and doesn't help as much as other big schools, you don't get exposed to quality humanities classes or even just discussions with peers like you would at a bigger school .... to name a few reasons \n\nThat being said, it's a great place to do grad school. The small faculty to student ratio means you don't gave to spend as much time teaching, the insane amount of money coming from research and private tuition means that everyone is funded and the research facilities are nice, caltech has an amazing academic reputation and you won't get confused for cal poly in research circles, caltech gives grad students a lot of freedom in comparison to undergrads, they make the assumption that you're here for the phd so you get research-like support even while taking classes, the small size means that if they admit you they really want you to succeed so quals and candidacy have higher pass rates than other schools, the smallness really forces inter-departmental academic collaborations. \n\nIf you really like Caltech, come here for grad school. Also, the general rule of thumb is that you shouldn't go to the same school for undergrad as grad school, so keep that in mind. \n\nGood luck with your decision",

I love it here as a grad student but knowing what I know now would have hated it as an undergrad. The environment is a bit small and sometimes stifling, and knowing most of my undergrad friends in STEM, there's a big chance that your interests will change a lot over time (in particular, towards more applied areas). Recruiting out of Caltech is not going to be as strong for industry compared to schools listed above, and coming to school here gives you a bit less flexibility. The opportunities run deep, but they don't run as wide as, say, Berkeley, where pretty much whatever you want to do in science or engineering is being done somewhere. At all of these institutions, as said earlier, the average instruction quality doesn't really vary much - what really matters is whether the content of what you learn and who you meet helps get you to where you want to go.\n\nThe social life-related concerns are also up there. There are just less opportunities for broad social mingling here compared to larger schools, which I find to be a huge negative. It feels like there is less diversity in friendships, worse odds at a good dating life, and fewer volume of connections to be made either in a social or professional setting. These are things that matter a lot earlier on in your student career that have huge trickle-down effects - who you meet early really shapes the kinds of places you go later on in your life, whether that's a friend you meet that gets you involved in research, an acquaintance that helps refer you to an internship that eventually lands you a full time job, or a significant other who helps stabilize your personal life. Besides, I always liked meeting and talking to folks studying in non-STEM fields (on top of enjoying some of the non-STEM courses I took), which is an aspect obviously missing from Caltech.\n\nOn the other hand, if what you care about is unbridled scientific achievement, then it seems like Caltech would be perfect for you. My advisor described it as an \"academic monastery\" - if that's the type of environment that you want to be in for your early experience as a student, then go right on ahead! Congrats on your acceptance. Despite what I said above, there's not really a wrong decision you can make here, only a different one. Best of luck!",

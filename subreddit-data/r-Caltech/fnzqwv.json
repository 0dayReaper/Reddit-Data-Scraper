    "postText": "Hello, I am a physician in California who is looking for help with the coronavirus outbreak. We have an idea for utilizing our engineering colleagues to help us out.\n\nOur problem is specifically how to minimize risk for viral transmission during airway management. Intubation is amongst the highest risk procedure for these patients, yet is necessary in critical patients. A Taiwanese anesthesiologist came up with a design for a simple cheap box for cleanable particle limiation. Please see the following for a basic schematic: https://sites.google.com/view/aerosolbox/design\n\nI think it could be done better, and if engineered to be produced at scale could save a lot of healthcare workers. Please let me know if anyone on this subreddit would be interested in helping.\n\nThank you.\nBrian Hondorp, MD\n\nEdit:\nWow! Thank you everyone for responding, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d get any responses.\n\nHere are where I see the current limitations with this design:\n\n1) Arm range of motion. Some patients, particularly those with \u201cdifficult airways\u201d require more manipulation of the head in order to achieve a sufficient laryngoscopic view for intubation. A modification that allows for greater range of arm motion, particularly in the vertical dimension, while maintaining minimal aerosol exposure would be great. Specifically, the arm motion that would be limited by this box is head and neck manipulation to allow placing the patient in the \u201csniffing\u201d position.\n\n2) The top seam on the working side is in the direct line of sight. While not a deal breaker, it would be preferable to have ability to see through a clear panel that is perpendicular to line of sight, rather than potentially needing to look through a seam. Perhaps an angled panel would help? \n\n3) The bottom of the box is entirely open. It is necessary to have space to accommodate a variety of chest circumferences, as well as having space for an assistant to hand the Endotracheal tube, circuit, etc.  However, this potentially exposes assistants or other staff standing nearer to the foot of the bed to higher viral loads. I think an ideal solution would seal the bottom without being rigid. A surgical gown (or even a blanket) could be draped over the bottom for this purpose, but increases disposable costs and setup time. Is there a simple way to avoid this while providing better isolation for the bottom of the box than open air?",

This would definitely knock the price point below 67 USD, and sizable quantities be readily obtained from big-box stores and modified for use by house staff in short order.",

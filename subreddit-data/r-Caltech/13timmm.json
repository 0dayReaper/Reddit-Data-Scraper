            "comment": "Extremely different. Ma1c anal(ytical) barely touches numerical calculation and works off of the rather famous text Calculus on Manifolds by Spivak. Read the Wikipedia page for it if you want a chuckle. Ma1c prac actually teaches multivariable calc techniques like Greens/Stokes theorem (or rather applying them to a specific problem and not just generally) and how to do the integration when dealing with more than one variable. The material is technically in the same area of math, but prac covers the mechanics and anal the theory.",

    "postText": "Hi there, I've been admitted as a Prefrosh to the class of 2024! I'm currently deciding between a few schools, so I'm just trying to get a feel for what life will realistically be like as a student (especially since I'm no longer able to visit). I've heard that at many prestigious schools, especially in STEM, the atmosphere is very competitive, and students will often try to sabotage each others' assignments and projects. Is this true for Caltech as well? As well, any other feedback about student life would be appreciated. Thanks!",

Don\u2019t expect anyone else to. Administration, particularly the deans, openly disdains it and openly (Dean Nye has explicity, at least) states that they believe that administrators are perfectly allowed to take unfair advantage of students, and admissions frequently does unintentionally by lying in their publications. But the vast majority of undergrads follow it, and will not take advantage of you.",

    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI'm a prefrosh at Caltech intending to major in CS. I am interested in exploring research and possibly going on to grad school for a PhD. This might change though as I don't have a lot of experience with CS research so I don't know for sure if its right for me. But I definitely do want to try it out. I had a few questions about this:\n\n1. I know that its generally not difficult to get a SURF over the summer, but how difficult is it to get research during the school year (and specifically during freshman year)? Especially if I don't have much prior experience in CS research.\n2. Is getting involved in certain fields of CS research more competitive than others as an undergrad at Caltech? Like is it more difficult to get involved in machine learning research specifically (as it is a very popular field). \n3. How difficult is it to handle research during the school year along with classes? How much of a time commitment is it generally? What kind of effort do professors / grad students expect undergrad students to put in? \n4. If I later want to  apply to top PhD programs, is there any advice you have for doing research? For example, is it better for me to focus all the research I do onto one specific field or can I explore different areas of CS research? Should I be aiming to get publications out of the research I do? Are there any other activities I should pursue?\n5. Are there any skills that you would recommend I develop / anything I should learn so that I can more effectively be involved in research? \n\nI don't know a lot about how undergrad research at Caltech and grad school admissions work so I would really appreciate any feedback/advice! I also do plan on taking the Introduction to Computer Science Research course at Caltech which I think will be helpful for better introducing me to CS research. Thank you.",

            "comment": "1. Its very easy and common. With that said, see #3 because not many students are able to balance classes and the workload of doing non-trivial research.\n2. Not really, basically any student that asks for research gets it unless the prof is too busy. If you're interested in ML research, just email one of the profs (you can dm me for specific profs) and they'll probably say yes. They might ask you take some courses first though, so maybe work CS156a+CS155 into your frosh schedule.\n3. Good research takes a lot of time (30+hr/wk). You could probably skate by doing just 10hrs/week of work but nothings going to really come of it.",

            "comment": "As a current Physics frosh, I can't answer most your questions, however I will say it is highly unlikely that you will have the time to do research during the school year. If it's really a high priority for you, it may be possible, but I recommend you take a year to adjust to the workload! You may change your mind.",

            "comment": "So CS research generally has a higher barrier to entry than a lot of other fields. If you want to do actual theory work, you need several difficult classes under your belt, and doing them during freshman year is not recommended. However, it is possible to start talking to professors early and get some sort of SURF project in the CS department as a frosh, and eventually end up doing CS research in later years. \n\nI haven\u2019t really answered questions specifically, but if you take the CS research course (called pizza courses bc you get pizza weekly for the lectures), you should go talk to the presenters after the hour is done and ask them about their work. Doing this would probably get you some sort of connection which you could use to get summer work.",

            "comment": "It's obviously not intended to be a comprehensive tour of the campus. The intended purpose is mostly to enjoy the beauty of the gardening and architecture. I intend to park around Pasqual and Catalina. The time of day in which the tour is to begin is around 5pm in the spring. I intend to make two stops: at the Milikan library for a birds-view lookout as well as to use the restroom, and another stop at the Red Door cafe for a coffee break. Other than these two places, the route doesn't pass through buildings.\n\nHow long do you think this walking trail will take at a leisurely pace? Any comments and suggestions will be greatly appreciated. For instance, if there are sites of particular historic/scientific interest, or if there's some building that is worth checking out on the inside, please let me know.\n\nA word about the numbering system. Firstly, the nodes on this route don't mean a thing. If I knew how to make them disappear while keeping the edges, I'd do it. As for the discontinuous numbering schema. I used Google Maps, and, for some reason, after reaching point \"J\" I was forced to start over at \"A\" again.\n\nEDIT 1: [Here's](https://imgur.com/6Mj43rK) a new version of the itinerary, updated according to /u/ajkkjjk52's [suggestions](https://old.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/awgvug/a_suggested_walking_tour_of_the_caltech_campus/ehmi0u7/).\n\nEDIT 2: I've just found [an \"official\" self-guided walking tour of the campus](http://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/documents/245-self-guided_tour_letter-sized_booklet2_march2016.pdf), published by the Caltech grad office. I think the tour I've put together works better for my purposes, since I wish to keep it short and sweet, and I don't feel compelled to visit every possible building on campus. Another advantage is that my tour is circular, which is helpful since I'll be arriving with my personal car. However, the information in the official tour will be helpful.",

When you're doubling back on San Pasqual, keep going and walk east all the way to the central lawn (\"H\" in the middle of your map) (your map needs way more letters, btw). Then walk along your desired path up to the wedding cake (Beckman Auditorium) and then to Beckman lawn and then double back again. Trust me that it's a nicer route.\n\nYou also, as the other person said, *need* to see the Athenaeum. Go do that.\n\nEDIT: that Caltech-published self-guided walking tour is exactly you need to do. Do that route. Don't do your route. Caltech is about as big as a postage stamp, so it does not take long to do all of this.",

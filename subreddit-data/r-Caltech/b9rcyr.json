Also stop being so cocky and thinking that it\u2019s \u201cin the bag\u201d for Stanford/umich/caltech grad school. \n\nSince you\u2019re an international student, you\u2019d better do something extraordinary in your year.... most of the internationals here have done something amazing and as a group, they are definitely smarter than most non internationals.

You can try, but don't expect anything.\n\nEdit 2// I just looked at the sample transfer questions. They're not difficult, but that implies that your performance on the exam won't be a decisive factor in transfer admissions.",

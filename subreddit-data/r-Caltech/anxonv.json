Btw i don't have much extracurricular activities, but i do love astronomy and physics. What i need to do to improve so i have higher chance to get in clatech?",

            "comment": "1. Get an internship at a university. It would be nice to get one in physics, but unless you know someone, this is difficult to achieve. It's more likely than not that you'll end up as a code monkey. That's fine -- embrace it.\n2. Brush up on your writing skills. The key is to show, not tell. When they ask you about your passions and interests (they still do that, right?), you need to be able to deliver.\n3. Get some unique extracurriculars. I only did extracurricular activities I loved, and none of them were affiliated with my high school. Only one of them was collaborative. The rest of them were solo activities, and that's fine. Caltech has its share of introverts.\n4. I've been reading your previous posts, and you seem to be deeply anxious about your future. And while that's part and parcel of being a teenager, this will screw with your head. Chance threads on Reddit and CC aren't going to make you feel better, and they won't really be useful. The best thing you can do right now is to take some time and figure out what you think you like. Hint: that interest doesn't have to do with physics. You like gaming? Try to make your own using UE4 or Unity. You like writing? Start your own novel. If you're still fluent in Chinese, this becomes a lot easier to do, seeing as you have a range of platforms to pick from (qidian, jjwxc, etc). Interested in coding? Write your own code and upload it to GitHub. It doesn't have to be good, but you should commit to this interest. That kind of drive is what the world (not just colleges) wants to see, and it will take you far.",

It's just funny seeing people list out their resumes, after a period of time where nobody gives a shit about past resumes because everyone's resume is equally impressive. I think you're absolutely in the right for sharing what you did to get in, because your intended audience is not Caltech students, but a prospective student wanting to know what it takes to get accepted.",

That way you can report triple 5s when you apply, which is a solid differentiator and demonstrates the necessary foundation.\nAlso, do some sort of research at a university, or be very involved with an engineering project like robotics.\n\nI realize most of these won't be available at your school, so find another way. Most of my friends had something along these lines when they applied. Don't let that discourage you, rather, realize that there is likely a way and ask for help (eg from parents, teachers, school counselor, online).",

    "postText": "Hi buddies! The decision deadline is approaching, and I am still deciding which program to join. I'm admitted to Caltech Chemistry and UCB ChemEng. In general, I'm more interested in some groups at UC Berkeley, while professors at Caltech that I am interested in have better papers (like h-index). Caltech also has a better social/nature environment, personally speaking. I'll appreciate everyone's advice and comments on balancing various factors (interest, paper, network, courses, etc.) regarding choosing schools and groups. And please feel free to share your research experience and feelings!",

I feel like it\u2019s best to have a more established advisor in a better environment and then postdoc at a bigger place like Berkeley (or Northwestern, in my position). I feel like there\u2019s a ton of really unique opportunities here that might not last, and going over shouldn\u2019t be as difficult of a leap. \n\nI welcome anyone else\u2019s opinion lol",

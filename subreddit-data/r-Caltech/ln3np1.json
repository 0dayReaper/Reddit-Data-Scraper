    "postText": "Hello! So I applied to Caltech\u2019s LIGO SURF program this summer and wondered if anyone knows when we would find out by? I know it says mid-late February mentors would contact but does anyone have any concrete experience with this?\n\nAlso, what are the chances of actually getting contacted and getting a position if you didn\u2019t like reach out to potential mentors? Im seeing posts of people saying they have contacted a PI etc. but I had no idea that was something one should do, so does that basically mean I\u2019m screwed?",

    "postText": "Do you have a question about what to write in your application essays? Or about what GPA and test scores are necessary to get in? Maybe you are not applying in the immediate future, but you would like to know what you can do to boost your chances of getting into Caltech.\n\nIf these are your questions...**please don't post them here!**\n\nThe people on this sub are not admissions officers. They are mostly current students (undergrad and grad) and alums who haven't been through the Caltech admissions process for years. \n\n**If you would like to discuss admissions with other students going through the process**, please instead go to the following subs:\n\n* /r/applyingtocollege for undergrad admissions\n* /r/gradadmissions for grad admissions\n\nOther good tools for answering your questions include the [Caltech admissions website](https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/) and [simply Googling](https://google.com) your question. \n\nOn the other hand, **this sub is welcoming to specific, thoughtful, well-researched** questions. Most of us found our time at Caltech to be highly rewarding, and we would love for you to share that experience. **Here are example GOOD admissions questions:** \n\n* (Undergrad) I am thinking about applying to Caltech, but not sure whether there is a program which suits me. I want to learn about both pure and applied math. I read in the catalog about the math major and the ACM major, however the former seems to pure and the latter seems too applied. Is there a way I can do both?\n* (Grad) I want to do research in quantum computing and have heard great things about the Vidick group. Does anyone know whether he is accepting students, and more generally what the research environment in his group is like? I have a chronic illness so I am looking for an advisor who is understanding when I need to take time off. \n* (Either) Does Caltech have an active basketweaving community? On the Caltech club list I found a link to a club website, but it hasn't been updated since 2007.\n\nEdit: This is not a megathread. Please do not comment with bad admissions questions down below -- they will be removed. If you have a good admissions question, please make a separate post and our community of students and alums will be happy to weigh in.",

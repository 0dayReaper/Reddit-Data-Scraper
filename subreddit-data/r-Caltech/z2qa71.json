    "postText": "Salutations! I hope this post receives you all well. To set the context, I applied REA to Caltech, as a non-US citizen (international student). The deadline for submitting \"[Parents' Non-Tax Filer's Statement for Foreign Filer or Foreign Non-Filer](https://www.finaid.caltech.edu/Applying/forms/nontaxforeign)\" is 14th of December as highlighted [here](https://www.finaid.caltech.edu/Applying/NewInternational).\n\nIn order to submit this, I need to sign-in to IDOC. However, IDOC requires me to enter my Social Security Number (SSN) or Insurance Number. Since I am not a US citizen, what should I do regarding that field?\n\nOr if there is another course of action, feel free to share! Also, I would like to apologize if my question seemed misleading or crude.",

Which kinda assumes that the decisions will be out at least a few days before 14th Dec...",

    "postText": "Hello I am currently a junior in secondary school in Canada and I was wondering if I am taking the correct steps to get accepted into Caltech. I currently have a 3.9 accumulated GPA and a unweighted 4.0 GPA for grade 11 so far. My practice SAT's for the Revised SAT range from 1400-1500 (there haven't been any official tests in Canada yet) and I plan on doing SAT II math II and physics subject tests this year. I have the top mark in Chemistry 11, Physics 11, and Sports Medicine 11. I also had the third highest mark in my IB math class. In addition this semester I have IB Physics, IB English, and Computer Programming 12 wherein I am among the top 5 students in both IB Courses and the top student in CP with 100%. I currently do competitive springboard diving and therefore do not have much time for science clubs. Nevertheless does it help that I am one of the top ranked users in Code Combat for python and I am currently learning Javascript? I intend to enrol in either Computer Engineering or Mechanical Engineering. As an international student what can I do to raise my chances of getting accepted?",

It doesn't have to be science based. Good grades and high test scores are necessary but not sufficient. Find something that will make you a valuable addition to the community. ",

The Code Combat thing is *very* good, and that's your ticket in. I would do more things in that vein, because Caltech *needs* to know that you are actually passionate about (and NOT just a fanboy of) science.\n\nThe springboard thing, unfortunately, is a red flag. If you want to continue it, Caltech would look askance at you, mostly because it removes all of your free time (for a lot of people), and that could easily cause you to fail if you don't de-prioritize the springboard ASAP.\n\nIf you're ok putting the diving on hold (in the admissions packets), not mentioning it at all (aside from on the activities/awards list) and talking JUST about your love of science and saying how the python coding really makes you so, so happy, then Caltech will not have an issue with it. If you don't want to put it on hold, then I would not suggest Caltech, because the simple probability is that you're one of the majority who will need all of their free time in your first year to pass classes, and you can't do that if you're doing another hyper-time-consuming activity.\n\nThe dirty little secret is that a few schools, like Caltech, MIT, and U Chicago, take up nearly all of your free time, because engineering and hard science majors take considerable amounts of time. Other majors just don't. At another top-tier school, your free time will possibly be gone if you're a hard science/engineering/CS major (really depends on the school), and it will be there if you're in political science or psych or underwater basket weaving, etc.",

                    "comment": "You're just... completely wrong.\n\nEdit:\nThis comment actually bugged me enough that I feel the need to elaborate. Let's go piece by piece.\n\n&gt; The Code Combat thing is very good, and that's your ticket in. I would do more things in that vein, because Caltech needs to know that you are actually passionate about (and NOT just a fanboy of) science.\n\nDon't \"do more things in that vein\" for the purpose of admissions. I participated in very few science-related extracurriculars and was still able to convey my passion for science in the application. \n\n&gt;The springboard thing, unfortunately, is a red flag. If you want to continue it, Caltech would look askance at you, mostly because it removes all of your free time (for a lot of people), and that could easily cause you to fail if you don't de-prioritize the springboard ASAP.\n\nCompletely false. Many people at Tech participate in extracurricular sports. As far as I know, no study has found a positive or negative correlation between student athletics participation and failure rate. Don't let this guy convince you that everyone here only spends their time working. There's a huge variety of things people do with their reasonable amount of free time here, and having commitments to a sport is not going to greatly affect your academics (Especially the first 2 terms, when you're on pass-fail).\n\n&gt;If you're ok putting the diving on hold (in the admissions packets), not mentioning it at all (aside from on the activities/awards list) and talking JUST about your love of science and saying how the python coding really makes you so, so happy, then Caltech will not have an issue with it.\n\nThere is no \"formula\" like this for Caltech admissions. The thing that makes this place great is that everyone here is an exception. I wrote the majority of my application essays on non-science-based extracurriculars, and got in. By far the most important principle to follow for your application is to show off what makes you unique.\n\n&gt;the simple probability is that you're one of the majority who will need all of their free time in your first year to pass classes, and you can't do that if you're doing another hyper-time-consuming activity.\n\nThe majority of frosh I know have no trouble passing their classes, and spend a LOT of time participating in house activities, sports, or other hobbies. Unless you have some other data to back up that claim, I would say that my anecdote cancels out yours.\n\n&gt;The dirty little secret is that a few schools, like Caltech, MIT, and U Chicago, take up nearly all of your free time, because engineering and hard science majors take considerable amounts of time. Other majors just don't. At another top-tier school, your free time will possibly be gone if you're a hard science/engineering/CS major (really depends on the school), and it will be there if you're in political science or psych or underwater basket weaving, etc.\n\nI know someone who's majoring in English at another school who seems to have less free time than I do. There are probably very few people with direct experience to compare the two things you're comparing (STEM at a top STEM school and non-STEM elsewhere). I know someone whose Photography class takes up more of their time than some of my lab classes have. ow, that's an anecdote- it doesn't mean much. The point is any comparison between these wildly differing fields is going to fall short.\n\n I will say I have heard that UChicago students have it pretty bad, but I can't confirm or deny that. I do know from my personal experience here, and hearing from friends in Mass., that extracurriculars of all kind (clubs, sports, pranks, parties) are a big part of life at the CIT and the MIT, and it's misleading to say that your free time will be gone if you enroll.\n\nOverall I would say your comment is far too elitist, and takes the wrong approach about how to get into Caltech. It's not about filling your free time with things that make you look like a good fit for the school. It's about showing why the person you really are is going to do well here and contribute something unique to the Caltech community.",

                            "comment": "I was literally on the admissions committee for three years. This advice is literally the formula for how to get in. You've reacted to it in a really bizarre way, because it's actual reality. Nothing to be upset over. \n\nDo they still put undergraduates on the committee? Importantly, do they still actually admit people alongside staff and faculty? If so, you should go talk to undergrads on the committee to square your own views with what really happens. \n\nI honestly did this for three years. I know it's not sitting right in your head, but if we look at your packet, I can tell you that you didn't set off the red flag detector and that you did convince people you loved *and could do* science much more and better than most people. Nothing crazy or complicated about that. \n\nUndergrads absolutely do sports. That's definitely a thing. It isn't, however, something that causes people to flame all that often. Actual professional endeavors (like trying to be an Olympian) could cause that, and we'd like to avoid that. \n\nImportantly, many other schools will want to hear about his diving because it shows so many good things - a work ethic, drive, self-motivation, persistence, etc. He could frame it like that. However, if he frames it as \"this is what I'm really serious about,\" he's in trouble, because it's a red flag, and Caltech is more than happy to throw people with those away, because we have a lot of applicants. I cannot stress that enough. \n\nOP, please take this advice. You can absolutely be a character on paper, and determined, but make sure you express your motivation in terms of science first and everything else second. Sorry I pissed off some random. ",

I'm sure all admissions are handled through the admissions office.\n\nAnd that's good - I'm just trying to remove any red flags, because people just don't realize how important they are. You do absolutely need the drive and grades, etc, and as long as you frame it that way, you're fine.\n\nIt does also help to show you're a bit of a character in your admissions packet. Caltech appreciates unique individuals. However, we have absolutely never failed to admit someone because they were not a unique individual. We've also never said, \"well I see red flags, but they're so unique and love poetry and speed skating!\"\n\nIt's a formula, and as long as you understand that and just maximize it with science + activities that show drive + great math and science test scores + grades + great recs + character + NO red flags, you're safe.",

Make sure you actually demonstrate your passion in science (go BEYOND the classroom - being a top student and taking APs and having 800s for science SAT aren't enough) and write about it in your applications.

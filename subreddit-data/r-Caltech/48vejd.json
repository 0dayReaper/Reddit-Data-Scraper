    "postText": "Hi all, I was accepted EA to Caltech this year and had some questions about Caltech. It would be great if someone could answer them for me.\n\n1. How is the food? Cafeteria food, local delivery services, LA, etc.\n2. If I want to study Physics/Applied Physics, how much non-Physics work will I be required to do per semester? Notably ones with essay writing or literature reading. How are the requirements compared to other universities?\n(2.5) If they exist, do these non-science courses have a defined course list (everyone takes the same required courses) or is there a broad selection of courses that satisfy the humanities requirements? Would taking a lot of music courses be able to satisfy them? If not, what is the least painful way to satisfy these requirements for someone who hates to read/write?\n3. Will I be stuck doing psets every weekend, or is it possible to have free time and go to LA/do other things?\n4. I've heard various rumours about Techers being extremely odd people (\"the goods are odd\"), how true is this? I think there is a difference between being motivated to do work and being plain weird/antisocial/lacking empathy.\n5. How is the shower/toilet quality, does it vary by house?\n6. Do the math/science courses typically involve some kind of technology application (matlab, mathematica), or is it mainly theoretical? How theoretical are the courses compared to those at other universities?\n7. I am interested in the Caltech-Cambridge exchange program (I was accepted to Cambridge as well). Is that still running, and will I be able to graduate on time if I do it?\n8. How cold/hot does it get in California?\n9. Are there a lot of League of Legends players?\n\nThanks in advance, might have missed a few questions.\n\nedit: some more questions\n\n10. Sports - any badminton, archery, or kendo in Pasadena?\n11. Major options - in a ranking of theoreticalness, what are Astrophysics, Applied Physics, Physics, and Applied Computational Maths like?",

            "comment": "1. Dinner food is meh. Lunch food is awesome. I still miss that from time to time after graduation. Pasadena has plenty of food options, and San Gabriel Valley / downtown LA offers good Asian food.\n2. It will be fine. While you might not like the humanities (I did not for most part), it is also really easy to just \"scrape by\".\n3. First two years will be rough. So maybe a bit of free time here and then on weekends. It largely depends on where you stand among the class.\n4. They are weird. But if you did not lie on your application, they accepted you for a reason - you will fit in just fine.\n5. By house, like a lot.\n6. Math and science are super theoretical indeed. There are some higher level classes that gives Matlab. I'm a TA at UC now, and it is definitely nowhere as theoretical as how Caltech was.\n7. It is running. I did it too! Whether or not depends on what you are doing. Not so easy if you're doing EE, and definitely easy for physics / math. But even for EE I've seen people managing it. Just gotta plan early on.\n8. Cold - at night - like every night. Hot - during the day - I was welcomed by 100F temperature at tech the first day.\n9. A lot. Sometimes too many.",

Though you'll still be in a ton of non-physics and non-hum courses, almost as a guarantee.\n\n3. Yes, especially after frosh year. More psets than trips to LA by far.\n\n4. Everyone here is weird, myself included. This does not mean we are asocial or lack empathy. I would even argue the intense stress makes Tech students very empathetic towards each other. \n\n5. Showers/toilets are fine all over.\n\n6. Mainly theoretical but you will learn to use programs like Mathematica and Matlab purely through necessity and gradual gains in experience.\n\n7. Yes.\n\n8. 30-100 degrees F. \n\n9. Too many.",

            "comment": "1. Lunch food at the cafeteria is pretty good, most people get tired of it after a while but that's more due to familiarity. Definitely way better than cafeterias at other universities I've been to. People like to complain about dinner but honestly I really liked the food, it's not amazing but it's solid and all-you-care-to-eat. Only negative aspect is the price of the board plan, but if you live on campus (which most people do) it's mandatory anyway, so it's already a sunk cost.\n\n2. If you major in physics, you'll need to take a healthy amount of other STEM and even humanities/social science (HSS) courses. I was an Applied Physics major and pretty much did the Physics curriculum, and most of my Physics classmates and I had no trouble with the other STEM courses. The HSS courses can be rough if you're not a solid writer, but there are definitely courses that are on the easier side (ask upperclassmen if you decide to come here, word-of-mouth course evaluations are the best way to determine is a course is worth it). Although in hindsight, writing is *always* more important than you think it is, even (or especially?) if you want to go into academia. Now that I'm at the graduate level, I stumble upon poorly written papers all the time and it's super annoying...\n\nAs mentioned before, you can only fill 4 of the 12 HSS requirements with music classes, although there are a few music history classes that count towards the advanced humanities requirement (you need to take 2 of these to graduate). I took the music theory/harmony series which is offered every other year and it's a great class. Most people at Caltech also aren't into music so the music theory class is always tiny and super fun.\n\n3. You'll quickly find out how efficient/smart you are your freshman year here. I would say the average Techer can plan to have 1 free weekend day in a normal week, and if you plan well enough, you can definitely take a few days off to visit out of town/etc. I generally had more free time with each advancing year, both due to increased efficiency and fewer courses taken.\n\n4. We're all weird at Caltech, but I would say most people mellow out after their freshman year, after the social atmosphere of college takes over. I actually think Caltech provides an amazing social atmosphere for the types of students who matriculate, since the tight house environment provides a gentle social welcoming to the typical awkward/shy high school nerdy type. There are always the truly odd cases, and perhaps Caltech has more of those, but I've never found that to be an actual problem. And every year we get a few students who really just don't fit in at all, so make sure to visit if you can to get a feel for what the school environment is like.\n\n5. I've used pretty much every shower/toilet on campus, and they've all be fine. Unless you're extremely fastidious about cleanliness, but living in a college dorm will quickly wean you off from that.\n\n6. Caltech courses are extremely theoretical, and the physics major is one of the more theoretical of the majors at Caltech. That said, the physics labs are amazing (the lab manager has pretty much spent the last few decades optimizing the classes), and if you end up studying physics here, you'll get amazing at using Mathematica. Matlab will depend on what electives you choose and/or research experiences, but I would say most physics majors here finish with a solid grasp of Mathematica and experience in other programming languages like Matlab/Python/etc.\n\n7. Yes, the program still exists, and graduating on time is totally doable if you're a physics major. You'll likely study abroad your junior or senior year, and only for a single quarter.\n\n8. I don't get the people who said it gets cold at night. Even the coldest of winter days in Pasadena will only dip to 32 F *maybe*. Although your standards of temperature will quickly change once you live in Pasadena - being forced to wear a jacket at night will soon become \"cold.\" Summertime gets uncomfortably hot, above 100 at times. Generally I find Fall and Winter to be great, Spring to be lazy and relaxed, and Summer to be absolutely unbearable.\n\n9. Pretty much everyone here plays League or has a friend who does. Lots of gamers here.\n\nI think definitely the most important thing would be to visit at Prefrosh Weekend if you can. Caltech is a pretty singular place, and there are a lot of people who think it's awesome and actually would be a terrible fit for the place.\n",

            "comment": "1. Concur with /u/Theutates. The board plan is also really overpriced, but mandatory for on-campus living.\n2. Take a look at the catalog: [pdf link](http://catalog.caltech.edu/pdf/catalog_15_16_part3.pdf),  [course descriptions]\n(http://catalog.caltech.edu/courses/courses.html).  Everyone is required to take 12 Humanities/Social Science classes, so an average of 1 each term. 2 of these are freshman humanities classes, 2 intro social science, 2 advanced humanities, 2 advanced social science, and then 4 others to be chosen freely (can use foreign language classes for this one). You can use music theory courses for the 4 free choice ones, and music history classes for the advanced humanities. You can't use music performance type classes for any graduation requirements, only as raw units (i.e. to make sure you aren't underloading). The social science classes don't involve very much (if at all) reading/writing, so if you want to avoid that take those mostly.  There's a pretty broad selection of classes, and they're usually some of the higher quality classes here.\n3. You will have a lot of work, but you can make free time. Don't plan on having *too* much free time on the weekends, but going somewhere interesting occasionally is definitely possible.\n4. Concur with u/Theutates. Come to pre-frosh weekend! There really is a variety of personalities here.\n5. I guess it varies by location a little bit, but I've never had problems anywhere. I'm not super picky on that though so idk\n6. Concur with /u/Theutates. Caltech is farther on the theory end than any other school as far as I know. Even computer science students are required to take some really heavy theory classes. Though more applied/technological stuff certainly exists if you look for it. I think many people use research as an opportunity to do those things, that's much better than really any class.\n7. I've known a couple people who've done study abroad in Cambridge for a term and had a pretty great time and graduated on time.  The administration who runs the exchange programs really sucks though, but people always manage to grin and bear it...\n8. Concur with /u/Theutates. It's not really *that* cold at night though. Lots of sunshine and warmth!\n9.  Concur with /u/Theutates\n\n",

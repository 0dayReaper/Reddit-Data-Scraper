I know Caltech is known for crazy amounts of sets &amp; little free time. \n\nFor past/current students, what kinds of jobs have you had? Were they worthwhile? Did your grades suffer because of your job? ",

You can get a job on campus as a tutor, student waiter for house dinners, a tour guide, at the library, etc. I think there are rules about how many hours a week you can do those, maybe max 15? Doing anything much more time consuming than that would be almost impossible with a full course load.",

This was a combination of working in the student coffee house, in various tutoring positions, and as a TA. \n\nI found that at Caltech, my grades were more reflective of my mental health than my workload.",

It was very flexible, you could sign up and work as few or as many hours as you wanted, they were usually evenings/weekends and you could enjoy shows for free as a perk.\n\nI don't know of anyone who worked an actual off campus job, but there were plenty of on campus student jobs available.",

I don't think the same positions exist these days, but there must surely be other on-campus jobs that are occasional part-time and thus perfect for undergrads.  \n\nHolding a regular job (even part time) would be at the deteriment of your participation in classes and school -- you're spending a lot of money to be there, and any income you have from working would be offset by the loss of value of the educational and social opportunities.\n\nI was fortunate in my junior/senior years to get some freelance consulting work where the client was very flexible about when I worked.  I did circuit board design and prototyping.\n\nI was already struggling with the classes I was struggling with -- but if I didn't have those jobs I probably would have spent a bit more time with those classes and have done better.  OTOH, in some ways, the work I did aligned with things I studied and that probably helped with a few of my classes. ",

It's a lot of work (more than taking it), but it's a lot of fun and you learn a lot doing so. \n\nI know some friends who formed companies or did some freelance work on the side. This kind of stuff requires you to be self driven and to want to find these opportunities, but it takes a real self-starter to seek out these opportunities.",

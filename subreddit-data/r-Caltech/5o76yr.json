    "postText": "I'm a junior undergraduate and I still have no idea how to publish research. Some of my friends already have coauthorships in JACS and Nature and when I ask them how they did it, they said they just did what their mentor told them to do. I've done two SURFs with different professors and I still haven't been listed as a coauthor on anything. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here. \n\nAlso, if I want to publish my own paper, do I just write one up and show it to my mentor? I'm basically clueless here.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I am an undergrad looking to transfer to Caltech for CS. I have already taken courses that are equivalent/similar to CS 38, CS 21, and CS 24 at my current uni. From the course catalog, it seems that they are all required for a CS degree. Does that mean if I end up transferring, I have to retake them at Caltech? Thank you!",

            "comment": "You said in one of your other comments that you\u2019re a freshman looking to transfer, so I have some doubts that the courses you took would be advanced enough that Caltech would count them towards those requirements. For context, those three courses (21/24/38) are the difficult intermediate courses that you usually take sophomore or junior year as a CS major. Courses equivalent to CS 1/2/3 would be more likely to transfer or at least allow you to place out of them without credit. \n\nTransferring to Caltech is also quite difficult. There\u2019s ~5 transfers accepted per year from a few hundred applicants, and there\u2019s an entrance exam that covers a lot of our freshman year core STEM requirements (plus some other stuff, check the admissions website for more details). A lot of transfer students also end up doing 5 total years in college between their original school and Caltech because we\u2019re kinda stingy in accepting transfer credit. I don\u2019t want to scare you off, but it\u2019s better to be aware of this before spending time and money applying",

I just happen to have a lot of background in CS and took an intro CS class in the summer to be placed into those courses. The syllabi of the courses mostly line up, so I thought I might be able to transfer credit. Having no credit is indeed quite a downside. I guess I will have to reconsider my decision of transferring to Caltech.",

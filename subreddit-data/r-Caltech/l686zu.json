I've loved, literally loved, planes and rockets for as long as I have memory so any tips in a PM or comment would be really really helpful.\n\nAlso - I know think Caltech runs NASA JPL (correct me if I'm wrong plz) so why doesn't have Caltech have an aerospace engineering undergrad major? idk it just seems kinda strange\n\nThank you in advance :)",

            "comment": "Caltech only has a graduate program, because frankly, that's all that Von Karman wanted when he started the program nearly 100 yrs ago. He only wanted graduate students. Hence the aerospace dept is the \"Graduate Aeronautical Laboratories at the California Institute of Technology\" (GALCIT). I think it's since been modified to Aerospace or something, but the fact is the same, no undergraduate degrees. \n\nYou can, however, take some of the aero classes as an undergrad and I think end up with an aerospace minor or something. \n\nNow, to your other question, get excited about the field! Go to airshows, museums, think about what you want to do. Is it to be a pilot? To go to space? To design rockets? Airplanes? Dirigibles?\n\nNows a great time to start that foundational planning of \"why do I want to do this?\"",

(I would give you an award if I had coins lol)\n\nAs for what I want to do - this is just a preliminary idea, but I really want to work on rocket designs. The work that SpaceX (and NASA + BlueOrigin too, ofc) is doing is really cool and appeals to me. I'm also kinda interested in (some point in my career) working on making space travel for normal people (like space vacations) a reality - working through the pricing, the logistics, the designs for rockets and capsules which would even do that kind stuff. \n\nI'm just a high schooler so these ideas might be a little naive or unrealistic, but I literally haven't got as much of a passion for aerospace as any other subject I've ever encountered. \n\nThank you for the help :)",

I suspect it'll still be far more expensive than traditional air travel, but I could see within our lifetimes the ability to take space vacations. It's not sci-fi, it's on the technology horizon. \n\nIt sounds like you're on the right path. \n\nThat said, engineering is a difficult path, so make sure you're doing well in your math and science classes, but don't let the other classes suffer too much either. Continue to do well academically and I'm sure you'll get into a great college that'll set you up for a good future in the industry.",

My grades have taken a hit though during COVID (I'm trying to keep them at all As, but previously I had majority A+s) but I really hope I'll be able to pull them back up.

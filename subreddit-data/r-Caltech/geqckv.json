    "postText": "I am deciding between Caltech and another bigger school for CS (just got off a waitlist) and was wondering if the small size at Caltech means that less companies come to actively recruit students. \n\nAlso, how does Caltech's emphasis on theory rather than application affect job search and internships?\n\nSorry if this has been asked before, but I would love to hear experiences from Caltech CS students who have been through internship/job search processes!",

            "comment": "Not a CS major, but the majority of my friends were. The vast majority of people have no trouble finding positions, usually securing an internship by December/January. I know a lot of people who have gone to the big names (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft) and then a lot of others who go to well-known, but less dominant, companies (Twilio, Tinder, Snapchat, Salesforce, etc.). You will definitely find an internship, the bigger concern is that your classes might not prepare you as well for work in the real world. Caltech CS is super theoretical and analytical, meaning you get a really good understanding of the theory, but might not have as much project coding experience, especially after freshman/sophomore year. Usually, this isn't an issue though, since most CS majors do just fine in their internships and are invited back the next year, since learning how to code in any language is not too difficult once you already know how to code. Hope this helps a bit and congrats on the acceptance!!",

            "comment": "Tech companies care a lot (too much imo) about the name attached to your college degree, and Caltech has a very good reputation in the tech industry. You'll have no problem getting interviews at any tech company you want, and lots of tech companies (including all the big names) come on campus twice a year for recruiting fairs and onsite pitches/interviews.  \n\n\nTotally agree with /u/MrMhmToasty that the CS program is very theoretical and might not directly prepare you for SWE internships/jobs, and that that's less of a problem than it sounds like. Tech companies hiring interns/new grads expect they'll learn their specific languages and frameworks on the job anyway. Congrats!",

            "comment": "I personally find that while Caltech career fairs tend to not always be populated by some tech/fintech companies that I was interested in, I almost ALWAYS got interest when I applied online or at a career fair not specifically at Caltech. (ie conferences, diversity events, club events, hackathons etc).\n\nCaltech students are pretty rare in the scheme of things, 1000 stanford students are going to apply to every tech position but maybe 10 caltech students will. Some companies like saying they've hired from a larger number of colleges, so you can a small advantage there. But otherwise you name will just carry weight and they'll pull your resume out of a pile over the other 1000 kids from various other less well known school.\n\nI picked Caltech over 2 Ivies and never did SURFS/research, I did 3 interships at large tech companies during my 3 summers. I do think Caltech's curriculum is more theoretical than most schools, specifically because of cs21 and cs38 which you can search and do some research on. It will not affect companies wanting to hire you, you are just going to need to do more prep on your own for interviewing, which you would probably need to do anyway tbh. But yourself a copy of cracking the coding interview now and read it cover to cover.",

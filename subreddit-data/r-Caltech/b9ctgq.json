    "postText": "Which one is better for the undergraduate level? Caltech is very theoretical whereas GT is very practical and hands on. Moreover, GT is ranked higher than Caltech for AE for undergrad. Nevertheless, the Caltech name possesses a ***disgustingly*** enormous amount of clout. Any Caltech AE students care to give some insight? Should I attend Caltech for graduate school?",

            "comment": "The most convenient thing about Caltech is that it\u2019s right down the street from JPL and there are a lot of opportunities to work there. Both are great schools and no one can  tell you what\u2019s \u201cbetter\u201d as it really depends on you. if I were you I would:\n1) visit and see how you like the culture / atmosphere. Ask yourself is it a good fit for you personally? You\u2019ll be living there 4 years!\n2) think about what type of aerospace opportunities you want post school (grad or undergrad)\n\nI really don\u2019t think you can go wrong with either BUT they are different in non academic ways that you should consider. \n\nBest - a Caltech ME who wanted to do AE and totally changed her mind :) \n",

            "comment": "I don't know why outsiders seem to have the impression that caltech is very theoretical at the expense of being practical. Caltech certainly has much stronger theoretical grounding. But it has very strong practical hands on work as well that does not lose out to other schools. Of course, the larger facilities have more diverse opportunities, but the depth of expertise in actual engineering is incredibly good.\n\nWhen I was there Niles Pierce was head of bioengineering and he was a Boeing aeronautics engineer. There are plenty of opportunities for graduate students to work with JPL for engineering NASA-related things. The bioinspired engineering group does quite a lot of nautical engineering. We have a very good practical EE workshop with a great supply of electronics and good classes for individual long term engineering projects.",

            "comment": "Just to clairfy, there is no Aerospace Engineering undergraduate major at Caltech. There is a minor that can be paired with another major (often Mechanical Engineering). That doesn't mean that Caltech is a bad choice for your undergrad, you would just leave with a minor in Aerospace and a major in something else. You would still be in a good position to get a good job in Aerospace or get into graduate school in Aerospace. \n\nI did my graduate work at Caltech in Aerospace and really loved the community and small school atmosphere. And the undergrads were very fun and quirky and it seemed like they had a good culture. You would get a good education at either school - there's no wrong choice here. Since I went to Caltech and not Georgia Tech, I'll just say that Caltech is a pretty special place and there's no guarantee you would get into its graduate program if you were to apply later - it is a very small and sought-after program. So if you want to go to Caltech, I would just go for it and not wait for grad school.",

            "comment": "To add to some of the things said by others,\n1.\tNone of us go to Georgia tech. We can only tell you the positives and negatives of Caltech. \n2.\tRankings don't matter. I could probably create an arbitrary yet seemingly balanced metric that puts USC'S admissions as most fair in the world, but it doesn't mean that's the experience of many. I like that you're asking about the honest experience, but rankings aren't the end all be all so don't let it scare you away. \n3.\tI understand why some people say \"I will go to Caltech for grad school not undergrad\" but I think the reason many choose to do Tech for undergrad is the experience. I know I love my experience with my houses and with the community that I wouldn't have interacted with as much if I was a grad student. \n\nCongrats on getting in to both schools! There's not a bad choice, so good luck picking one!",

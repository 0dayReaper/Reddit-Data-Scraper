I gave it all in my applications but I still couldn't make it.\nFor now, I got into UCSD so I will probably go there.\n\nJust wanted to ask what is the way to get transfered into CALTECH and what GPA/ work should I get to do it\n\nThank you for your help!\n\n",

Few people get it and the bar to get in is incredibly high. Don't let that scare you off, just know that you will need to really give it everything. Best of luck! ",

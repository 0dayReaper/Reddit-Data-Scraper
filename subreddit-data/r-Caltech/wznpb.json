    "postText": "It was [announced a few days ago](http://features.caltech.edu/features/407) that Caltech will be offering online courses through Courera. In fact, Caltech is not just going to offer courses on Coursera, Caltech is actually becoming an [equity investor](http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/coursera-signs-agreements-with-caltech-duke-epfl-lausanne-georgia-tech-johns-hopkins-1680491.htm) in Coursera.\n\nWas there any open discussion of this on campus beforehand, or is this out of the blue?\n\nThere was some grumbling over one of the Stanford online classes by students in the \"real\" class that their course was getting dumbed down to make it more suitable for the online audience, and that the edited online lectures were better than the in-class lectures. Are steps being taken to make sure that doesn't happen with Caltech courses?\n\nSo far, three Caltech courses have been announced on Coursera:\n\n[Principles of Economics for Scientists](https://www.coursera.org/course/econ1scientists) by Antonio Rangel. I don't see anything saying what Caltech offline course it corresponds to, but it does say it will be taught concurrently to online and Caltech students, so I assume it corresponds to something.\n\n[Galaxies and Cosmology](https://www.coursera.org/course/cosmo) by S. George Djorgovski. It says it corresponds to Ay 21, but doesn't say if it actually will be taught concurrently and identically to live Ay 21.\n\n[Drugs and the Brain](https://www.coursera.org/course/drugsandbrain) by Henry A. Lester. No idea what this corresponds to.\n\nAs far as I know, Caltech has only done one other foray into full online classes with homework, exams, and discussion forums--the [Learning from Data](http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) course offered earlier this year by Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa, and currently being offered again. From what I've read, the online students greatly liked that class. How was it received on campus? Did having the lectures filmed and broadcast live, and having online students able to submit questions for the Q&amp;A after each class cause any annoyance for the on-campus students?\n\nFinally, is anyone surprised Caltech is going with Coursera instead of one of the other online education initiatives? My guess would have been that when Caltech made a move into online education, it would have been by joining MIT and Harvard on [edX](http://www.edxonline.org/).",

I don't think this was ever brought to the undergrads officially. \n\n&gt;How was it received on campus?

It was a little annoying to not be able to ask questions during class, but most people actually left in the break between class (about 70 minutes) and Q&amp;A (about 15 minutes). It mostly just meant getting out early. The class was also easy and also well-taught enough that questions weren't typically necessary.\n\nI only stayed for Q&amp;A on the first day and the online people asked a lot of really dumb questions. I heard that they got a lot more intelligent later on once we actually had content, but I didn't tend to stick around.",

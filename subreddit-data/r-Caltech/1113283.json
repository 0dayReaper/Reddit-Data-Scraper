I was told to make it a surprise and hence I can't ask them to confirm.\n\nI was given the address\n\n1200 E California Blvd\n1234 (it's 4 numbers here, I put 1234 just to show an example)\nPasadena, CA 91106\n\nThe thing is, googling it shows that this is for the \"children's center\" so Im not sure if this is just a generic school address or if the student here will actually receive it.",

            "comment": "As an undergrad, the way I format my address is\n\n&gt; First Last \n\n&gt; 1200 E California Blvd\n\n&gt; MSC - 420\n\n&gt; Pasadena, CA  91126\n\nSo if those numbers you have are the MSC, that's probably the way to do it. I would also double check with the original person who suggested the surprise. I believe there's slightly different ways that the addresses work depending on whether the person is a grad student, an undergrad, or staff. The other thing I would wonder about is how the flower delivery service works, since the mail office usually takes a few hours to process received mail and notify students that it arrived, which means it might not work out perfectly if the service is a real person showing up to your door.",

From there, they sort the mail by mail code and cart deliver it to each building mail boxes.   \n\nFor flower parcels, like 1-800-flower,  I've had it delivered directly to my lab because actual building adress and room number was used instead of 1200 E. California Ave.  Delivery guy called to ask for directions and I met him outside. \n\nIf you want to be sure, call the mail room and ask Darrel (supervisor) there what's best.  Good luck and hope she/he likes the flowers!",

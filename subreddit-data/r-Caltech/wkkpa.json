What I can tell you though is when I brought up one of the essays on my application all of them remembered my application. \n\nMy advice to you: be yourself and let your personality show in your application. Caltech really likes students with character and a personality. Everyone who applies usually has a 4.0, is valedictorian, and has a near perfect ACT or SAT score. The way you distinguish yourself is through the written part of your application. Good luck and hope to see you at Pre-Frosh weekend if you get in! :)",

On the other hand, I had a bit of research experience in high school. Like TimiTimea said, I'd try to focus on what part of your background is unique or at least somewhat interesting, beyond numeric values. Plus, don't discount The Box (that fill-in-what-you-want space on the application), if it still exists; I wrote a short essay on the physics of time travel, and I think mine was probably among the least creative among my freshman class.",

One of the things that will find is that you will understand what a college is looking for if its the college is meant for you. What that is exactly is fora college is up to you to decide. From my personal experience, I'd say that Caltech first of all looks at your grades and classes to decide whether or not you'd enjoy the vigorous courseloads at caltech. Then it looks to see whether you are quirky, and to see if you'd make a good fit in the crowd. Don't write about dorky things just to write about dorky things because caltech is known for its nerdiness. Write about your passions, and what your passions mean to you. \n\nCaltech sent me a note saying they really liked my short response on how to have fun. I wrote about how i really enjoyed cooking and hosted an outdoor cooking contest yearly for fun. \n\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "Hi, everyone! I'm looking to apply to Caltech later this fall (through QuestBridge) and I have a few questions. Unfortunately, I cannot visit because my family is short on money. I plan on majoring in Applied math/Econ and wish to have a little bit of a laid back yet challenging experience. Already visited Williams and loved it. Have my gaze fixed on caltech for now.\n\nSo, the questions:\n\n1) Where else were you accepted and do you regret coming here?\n\n2) What's the best about caltech?\n\n3) what's the average caltech student LIKE?\n\n4) if I didn't build a robot or make a website and am not that type of guy (I'm more of a data analysis, stats, math guy), am I even gonna fit in?\n\n5) Social scene? Dating scene? Or is that nonexistent?\n\n6) How's the gym?\n\n7) Is food nice?\n\n8) Are dorms nice?\n\n9) How easy is it to get a job before graduating (in the northeast, not Cali)\n\n10) What's the absolute WORST thing about caltech? What do you despise with all your heart?\n\n11) Sleep? Is majoring in Applied Math and minoring in Econ(quantitative) even manageable?\n\n",

That being said, I've loved this aspect of 'tech. (Sorry this doesn't really cover your questions, answering everything would take a few essays. That part of your preamble just lept out the most to me.)",

Binge drinking, crying, reddit \n\n4. You're fine. The average student is very analytical.\n\n5. Sleep, grades, social life, pick two. There is an active dating scene because people have to get their rocks off. Most relationships start as friendships, there's less dating-as-an-interview. Beware, it's a small school so gossip is rampant. \n\n6. Good. PE classes are good too.\n\n7. Yeah, I still miss the Mongolian bbq. You get sick of house dinners eventually but they're not bad.\n\n8. From a grown up perspective, they're kinda gross. From a student perspective, they're heaven. \n\n9. Pretty easy. Career fairs and the career center make it pretty easy to get an internship. \n\n10. Other undergrads. On a whole, they're very sheltered and privileged and don't understand how lucky they are. \n\n11. Sleep, friends, grades. Pick two. You can talk to upperclassmen to figure out how to balance your courseload. It's definitely doable. Look for classes you can double count. Most of your econ classes will also count towards your hum requirement. \n\n\n",

They are far nicer (and newer) than my current grad dorm room and they are air conditioned and have a sink inside. Also much nicer than a dorm I stayed in over the summer at a different uni. Although I heard they recently swapped out the wood desk-beds for the annoying metal beds that are more common in dorms.",

At Tech, there's no looking out from the bubble. \n\nI guess I didn't expect to be broken so badly. Like, my blood pressure still spikes when I have to check my grades. A larger college probably would have provided more context to what is normal behaviors and what isn't. \n\nI went to college for the terrible reason of \"that's just what you do after high school\". I wanted to learn engineering skills to get a good job and build cool stuff. \n\nI really wish I had applied to MIT. Engineering is actually fun here. The instructors are better and the semester pace is much better to absorb material. \n\nI'm sorry I can't give you more specific advice about ACM. Caltech is a science school with a heavy emphasis on research. Perhaps the science majors are closer to the norm. Most people who started in ACM are working on their PhDs (some in economics). Some are working for CS startups and many ended up graduating with \"easier\" majors like CS and business.",

            "comment": "1) All the UCs, Cornell, UMich, Harvey Mudd, MIT, Brown. There are days I regret coming, and there are days where I don't. I definitely wasn't prepared for how proof-heavy the courses here would be. The community definitely makes up for it though. The support systems here are fantastic.\n\n2) How easy it is to get one-on-one time with a professor. It's very helpful for filling any gaps in knowledge you have. Befriending a professor is also a very easy way to meet people in the field. Networking is very important!\n\n3) Caltech is a pretty diverse place despite its size. You'll likely be able to find people that share similar interests with you. Also, Caltech has 8 houses (soon to be 9) to choose from, each with their own personalities, which can help you meet people like you. Pretty much the only common trait I can say everybody has is the desire to learn.\n\n4) Yes, you will definitely fit in. Caltech has a place for everybody, and its not determined by what you've done previously, but what you're willing to do when you get here.\n\n5) People are very social here (unless you choose not to be). Every freshman year is rampant with relationships.\n\n6) The gym is pretty good I'd say. I go about once a week, and it has everything I needed. \n\n7) Depends on who and when you ask. During special occasions like rotation or prefrosh weekend, the food is pretty darn good. (Or if you eat at Tom Manion's!) Any other time, the quality of food drops pretty low. My friends and I go out to eat or cook food for ourselves often because the food can get pretty inedible.\n\n8) I've lived in Dabney, Avery, and Braun and I'd say that all three of them have their pros and cons. Overall, I'd rate all of them fairly high. Dabney and Avery dorms are fairly similar, though I think Avery rooms are a bit bigger. Braun rooms are massive. I can't say the pros and cons of Avery and Dabney too much other than they relate to the houses' personalities. (We can't tell pre-frosh anything opinionated that might bias them towards or away from any of the 8 main houses. We have a whole system for pre-frosh to learn about the houses once they come to Caltech). Braun is off-campus, which means it doesn't have much personality. You can meet other people living off-campus, but it's fairly calm and quiet (which I enjoy).  \n\n9) Getting a job is pretty easy due to the career fair (and the perk of having Caltech on your resume)\n\n10) The fact that Caltech is a very small campus filled with very bright individuals means that everyone will be comparing your highs to the best and brightest's highs. It can get very demoralizing very fast. Considering that you're thinking about coming to Caltech, this means that you are probably top of your class at high school. Maybe valedictorian or salutatorian. The problem is, everybody else at Caltech is as well. Being valedictorian becomes above average. Salutatorian becomes below average. Going from being top of your class with a perfect GPA to becoming middle of the pack is a strong possibility, and this happens to many, many people here. You definitely need strong mental fortitude if you want to survive. Of course, everybody is different and you may in fact be smart enough to continue being at the top. I'm just speaking in terms of averages. So my answer to this would be how damaging the Caltech environment can be to your mental health. Either that or the food.\n\n11) Sleep is definitely a thing that you might start missing. I'm a CS major, so I can't speak for your other question, but there are definitely classes (both CS and not-CS) that will make you lose some sleep. For CS, classes like CS 155, CS 124, and CS 38 are some that have made me pull multiple all-nighters. For non-CS, friends of mine of all kinds of majors have all pulled all-nighters for multiple classes. Applied math and Econ are definitely not exceptions. ",

            "comment": "If you're looking for a laid-back environment, you might want to rethink Caltech. The Caltech workload is not laid-back!\n\n1) I was accepted to MIT after being deferred EA. I also got into Berkeley, Cornell, and UIUC. I was rejected from Stanford and wait-listed from Harvard.\n\n2) If you seek them out and take research opportunities, you can get to know your professors well. This is a benefit of small classes.\n\n3) Caltech students are geeky but are not necessarily the stereotypical introverted geek. The ones who are more social do better because they can collaborate on problem sets, ask for help, etc. \n\n4) Plenty of Caltech students are not into robotics or web development. Some might have prior research or science competition experience, but not all.\n\n5) Most socializing happens within the student houses and centers around collaborating on work. One complaint is that many students don't socialize outside their house. In the past, the M/F ratio was very lopside, but it's closer to 50/50 now. \n\n6) Not bad, but I didn't really take advantage of it as a student. (I now work on campus full-time and am more into fitness than I used to be, so now I use it.)\n\n7) It depends. The food in the student houses was not great. Chandler, the main dining hall is okay, although I've had issues with some of the food. I like Broad Cafe.\n\n8) Not bad for college dorms. When I lived there 20 years ago, housekeeping was provided, I think more than once a week. Avery was nicer than the regular student houses, but less family-like. I found the South Houses more claustrophobic, but you can get a single room. In the North Houses, you need to have a roommate. Avery has a mix. Caltech is building more on-campus undergrad housing, so in the future, all undergrads might be able to find on-campus housing. This is not the case now. \n\n9) I'm not sure about the Northeast. Caltech is targeted by recruiters from top tech/finance companies that hold on-campus information sessions and interviews through the Career Center and set up booths at Career Fair. They also advertise for interns. Most Caltech graduates do well professionally. However, I did not, and I had trouble getting hired for both internships and full-time positions.\n\n10) Probably the workload that left little time or energy for leisure or extracurriculars. I also believe that I wasn't well-suited for Caltech. I was not that strong in math and science or prepared for rigorous proof-based math.\n\n11) People do double major, but don't count on getting enough sleep. ",

I\u2019ll answer a few.\n\nFirst, if you want laid back, in any fashion, Tech is not the place for you.\n\n2) The best thing about Caltech for me was the House system. It\u2019s pretty unique, and wonderful for socialization and gaining friends, and for growing as a person.\n\n3) Pretty normal except smart and talks about science and math a lot\n\n9) Not too bad. The reputation helps.\n\n10) The anxiety. Soul crushing work all the time leaves no time to think about and resolve other problems in your life, and so everything kinda snowballs over the course of terms and it can cause some fairly severe mental health struggles.\n\n11) Some of the most exceptional people I know here, single majoring, don\u2019t get more than 5 hours on an average night. But that\u2019s because they socialize on top of their work. Others get 10 hours a night, but don\u2019t have time to socialize. It\u2019s kind of a pick one sort of thing. That major minor combination sounds doable, though.",

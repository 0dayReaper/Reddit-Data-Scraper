I\u2019m terrified of insects so is there anything I can do to minimize chances of seeing them in living spaces/dorm room? Also, I know that I shouldn\u2019t pick a house based off of this but I have to ask: is there any house that typically has the least bugs? Thanks!",

            "comment": "You'll definitely sometimes see cockroaches on the Olive Walk at night, pretty much no way to get around that other than just don't go outside at 3am. There were also snails everywhere sometimes after it rained, maybe 2-3 times in the spring? they TERRIFIED me oh man but that didn't happen often. Don't go in the tunnels, while they were mostly fine in my experience, it's still not something I'd recommend to seek out. It kinda depends how bad it is, if it's a full-blown phobia you might want to try and stick to living somewhere where there's winter (unless you think you can try to get over it) but if it's just anxiety and you can live with what I described you should be fine. Also if it's a diagnosed mental issue you should probably talk to someone (deans maybe?) about any possible arrangements? I graduated a while ago now so I don't really have any specific comments on particular houses or whatever but if you'd feel safer living in one house over another, because of this issue, that's definitely something that should be brought up.",

Humidity seems to mean more and bigger bugs in the summer/fall.\n\nUsually 2nd story should have fewer bugs than 1st story though OP. And maybe you can find a roommate or neighbor who is good at killing bugs.",

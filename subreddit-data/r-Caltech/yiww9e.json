    "postText": "Hello everyone, I think some of you may already know who I am, but to those who don't, my name is Goku Black (not my actual name but whatever) and I am a Georgian applying to Caltech in the Regular Decision round this December (already applied to MIT Early Action). There are some questions I have regarding the application process, and I am not 100% lost since I already finished all Caltech required supplementals and additional (non-required) supplemental essays and am in the process of rewriting, revising, and making them better.\n\nAnyway, some questions I have particularly pertain to the **Maker/Research Portfolios** that Caltech allows for applicants to submit. Although I know they are probably similar to any university portfolio (I submitted a Maker Portfolio to MIT about my electrical engineering project involving salinity detectors), I am mainly asking for what does Caltech look for in its applicant's portfolios. Do they want a video? A series of images with descriptions? What is it that they specifically want (for MIT they made it clear about how they wanted the portfolios done). Also, does Caltech allow for the submission of **Music and/or Arts Portfolios** similar to MIT? \n\nAnother few questions are about the environment of Caltech. I visited MIT a handful of times, a few times walking and another few times biking through the campus and I absolutely loved the campus and the environment. I haven't yet gotten the opportunity to visit Caltech's campus (I wanted to visit during the national science olympiad tournament but that was held online.....sad moment) yet, but a friend of mine (who applied to Caltech REA) told me that it was small but beautiful and vibrant. I'm hoping to get a chance to visit Caltech in the November break but I can't be sure, so I guess I'm on here asking Caltech students how Caltech's environment is. I know that it's demanding and pressuring, but how is the student environment? How is the collaboration like? Are teachers/professors there open to supporting students and collaborating on research? How is the SURF program at Caltech? How is the area of Pasadena that surrounds Caltech? \n\nThank you to anyone who reads this in advance, it is much appreciated.",

            "comment": "Most of your questions are answered in the pinned post for the subreddit. \n\nAs for the Caltech environment ones, it\u2019s a bunch of nerds doing really difficult work together, which is both a good and bad thing. The collaboration is everywhere because of the honor code, and profs are pretty easy to get in contact with and potentially do a SURF with. The bit of Pasadena nearby is pretty nice, but you need to walk a bit (.5-1.5 mi) to get to any restaurants or shops. Unfortunately LA public transit is garbage so unless you have a car, a friend with a car, or a decent Uber budget, it\u2019s a bit hard to get off campus.",

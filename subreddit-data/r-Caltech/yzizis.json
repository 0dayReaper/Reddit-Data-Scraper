I know it's possible to transfer (even if I don't have very good odds) but will any of my credits still count? Will I have to do another 4 years? A comment on another post in a similar vein mentioned that you'd have to start over like this. Is that correct?",

The only transfers I knew who weren't re-starting from very nearly scratch were 3/2 transfers from specific schools which had that shared program.  \nRate: Maybe 1 or 2 transfers a year for current undergrad population of 1000.",

If you\u2019re not satisfied with your course transfers, you can also talk to regis office and/or meet with professors to advocate your case. Hope this helps!",

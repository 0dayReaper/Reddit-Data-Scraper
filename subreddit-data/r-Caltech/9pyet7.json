    "postText": "Hello! I have gotten the idea to try dropping a pumpkin in a recreation of your yearly pumpkin drop. We have a similar height drop. ~100 feet, and I have access to lots of LN2. My question is, how do you make sure the pumpkin does not crack before it is dropped? Every time I freeze something in LN2, there is a nearly 50% chance of it breaking in two or more pieces. (and it is not like it is a turbulent environment due to boiling, it is a good Dewar, so once the object cools, the LN2 has minimal convective currents) \n\nWould putting a hole in it so that it can freeze more uniformly help? \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "The dabney pumpkin drop team usually freeze a batch of 40ish pumpkins in a large homemade cooler (roughly a cube with walls of two-inch-thick styrofoam). The cooling happens in three stages: room temperature -&gt; industrial freezer (the caltech dining staff help with this part) -&gt; cooler full of dry ice -&gt; cooler full of LN2.\n\nUnrelated to the freezing: if you need to carry frozen pumpkins up a ladder, an IKEA bag (or any large net with handles) is a wonderful thing.\n\nBest of luck!",

I supposed there is simply too much thermal shock to go straight to LN2. \n\nI actually do need to get up a small ladder, so that last advice is probably also going to be very helpful.",

            "comment": "When does this cracking happen? During freezing? While it's sitting in the liquid nitrogen? Granted I've personally never tried freezing anything as large as a pumpkin, but I've never had things break during the freezing step.\n\nI remember the freezing process taking a while though, with pumpkins sitting in LN2 for days in preparation for the event.",

                    "comment": "Thank you for the reply! \n\nIt is hard to be certain, as while objects are cooling down there are clouds everywhere and the LN2 is all frothy and thus hard to see through, but it seems to be near the very end as that is when the object is most delicate. (once everything settles down it either is or is not cracked and it does not change state past that) I figure it has to be either thermal contraction or turbulence causing the cracking. \n\nThe largest thing I have ever frozen was a very large fuji apple, and it split in half. \n\nDo you think that the days of soaking in LN2 really matter? I figure after a day there is no way any particular part of the pumpkin is appreciably above -196C. ",

We usually end up with irregular pieces about 6 inches ~~radius~~ diameter, but there's a lot of variance in size. Honestly I'd say most of the focus of the event is on timing the drops so they crash to the beat of the music (which is harder than it sounds, because you have to know when a couple seconds earlier to give them time to fall). Sorry my reply's a bit late.",

Location is great, the apartments are ok, and you'll be local for a lot of the social stuff that's put on by the school for grads. You can even get away without having a car if you're ok biking or doing your shopping at Trader Joe's (Ralph's is doable, but it's a pretty darned long walk).",

Unless you're bringing in a lot of savings from a previous career or have parents to support you, there's no real way to afford a 1BR apartment on the stipends offered by the school.\n\nI believe Caltech also has unfurnished apartments available to grad students that are lightly subsidized, but they have a wait list. Also not sure how many there are anymore since the ones I looked at were demolished to put in a new academic building a year or two ago.\n\nIf you're looking for less expensive apartments, look to the east of campus; likely near Sierra Madre Blvd. If you go to the west, it's probably not horrid until around Los Robles since prices go up closer to the Gold Line (light rail) station at Del Mar &amp; Arroyo. You can go north of campus, but if you go above the freeway the area gets a little sketchier, though really not *too* bad. It becomes more of a low income mix versus students from PCC/Caltech and young professionals.",

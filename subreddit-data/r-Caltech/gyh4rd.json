    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nCurrent aerospace engineering bachelors at an R1 university looking at potential master's programs. My goal is to work in the space industry -- preferably at SpaceX, JPL, Virgin, Blue Origin type companies, either in the space systems or space GNC/astrodynamics fields. I'd love to attend Caltech's Masters in Aerospace engineering program, but the cost is exorbitant (both for tuition/fees and cost of living in LA) and they do not offer TA positions to MS students. I'm not stupid enough to take out student loans (fuck them since they drive up the cost for the rest of us) so I won't go anywhere that I won't get funding. Caltech is appealing because it's close in proximity to all of these amazing space companies, and along with USC and UCLA, Caltech is the one of the most common school for people working at these companies due to that prestige and more importantly, proximity.\n\n**Does anyone have any feasible solutions for obtaining funding (AS AN ACCEPTED Aerospace MS candidate), preferably before I have to make any decision to commit?** i.e. As an accepted MS candidate, is it feasible to reach out to professors to secure Research Assistantship funding before I have to make a decision or is it at all likely that I'd be able to actually secure a teaching assistantship position in another department (i.e. EE, Math, etc.) as the department website suggests?",

Many other employers offer tuition assistance as well. Obviously, this can be tough time-wise if you have kids or other outside time sinks.",

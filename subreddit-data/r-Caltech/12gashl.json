Expect a decent amount of substituting non-vegetarian dishes with tofu or plant based meat . For every house dinner / Browne special, there's always a vegetarian and vegan alternative.\n\nYou can check the menus for Browne dining hall, Broad, and Red Door here: [https://dining.caltech.edu/where-to-eat-#browne-dining-hall-a2962b99-tab](https://dining.caltech.edu/where-to-eat-#browne-dining-hall-a2962b99-tab)\n\nAnd meal plan dinners here: [https://dining.caltech.edu/student-meal-plan](https://dining.caltech.edu/student-meal-plan)",

I prefer cooking for myself!\n\nYou can also consider signing up for a special meal plan, where you get your own meals custom made every day. I believe they can do that for religious diets. Quality will vary.",

Approximately how much time of the day do you spend behind cooking? Also, is it possible to have a breakfast meal plan and cook the lunch and dinner on your own?  \nThanks a ton!",

You can't buy a meal plan just for breakfast, but you are free to only eat breakfast from CDS if you'd like. They're very restrictive about the meal plans sadly, you waste a lot of money.\n\nI usually cook for a few hours over the weekend and meal prep, if I need to cook on weekdays I do simple stuff that only takes 10-20 minutes.\n\nI generally find this pretty manageable. You don't really have that many classes to go to during the day.",

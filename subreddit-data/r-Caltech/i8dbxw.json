I'm Chilean (a country next to Argentina), and I'm thinking about applying to CalTech for engineering (chemical, environmental or industrial).\n\nIs there anything you would like to advice? Reasons why I should apply, reasons to not, maybe things that as students you know that isn't too available online?\n\nI've been researching for a really long time, but I'd still like some more info :) thank you!",

The application process is very different if you are an international student or a domestic student. I think most general advice in both cases is easily found online though. If you have any specific questions feel free to DM me. \n\nAlso, if you really like STEM and are prepared to work hard for 4 years, then you should definitely apply! I've only been here for a year but I definitely enjoyed my first year, and there are also more Chileans here than I expected (as in more than 0!) \n\nGood luck in your application process!",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm interested in applying to Caltech, but I'd like to hear from current students about how life on campus is. I have a slight feeling that Caltech's official website (like all other college websites) is not necessarily showing the whole picture about Caltech; thus, I feel that hearing about campus life from actual students would be much more informative.\n\nSome questions:\n\n1. Is there a strong gaming community?\n2. How social are Caltech students expected to be?\n3. What do you do in your free time (i.e. any time that's not spent at class or doing classwork), and how much free time do you have?\n\nThanks.\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone that has already answered! I just had a few other questions:\n\n1. I'm thinking about applying for CS, and I've heard that the CS major has a very high workload. I'd just like to verify that.\n2. Do students usually take research opportunities during the semesters, or only during the summer (or not at all)?",

The houses are especially conducive to it\u2014there\u2019s normally at least one other person in common spaces at all hours (seriously, all hours) in my house. There\u2019s an old saying: \u201cgrades, sleep, or social life: pick 2\u201d and it\u2019s definitely applicable to the school. It\u2019s extremely hard to maintain all 3 at functioning levels. Some people and majors have more free time than others, but you aren\u2019t likely to have much without compromising on your grades. \n",

You will definitely be able to find people to game with, either board games or pc games. Free time for me was mostly spent sitting around in a lounge or someone's room and chatting. Free time varies a lot based on coursework - I had some terms where I felt like i was dying from the amount of work, and some where it was like &lt; 10 hours a week on classes (though my situation senior year was a bit different because I ended up not graduating early after planning to do so, and so as a result I was taking 1.5 classes a term basically)",

There were a couple of frosh who we called \"the stealth twins\" because they were twins and no one ever saw them that first year.  In later years they were more sociable (of their own accord) and were nice guys.\n\nFree time depends on your major and what year you're in.  Frosh should be easing into it.  If you're dying as a frosh consider a transfer because it pretty much only gets harder (with a few exceptions).  Sophomore and especially Junior year can be soul-crushing.  Doing the EE courses was rough.  One time a frosh got up in the morning to see our study group still working on our problem set.  \"Hey - that's where you guys were when I went to sleep six hours ago.\"  Thanks a fucking lot, frosh.  \n\nThat year was rough - problem sets kept us up all night 3-4 times a week.  There was time to play on the weekends, which basically involved copious drinking to dull the pain.  \n\nNo matter your major, there will be times when it'll be rough.  The joke is when you're sophomore you say, \"Why am I here?\"  When you're a junior you say, \"Why am I alive?\"\n\nBut the workload and close quarters do make for close friends.  ",

            "comment": "a) I go to caltech, so other people who have surfed might have better opinions on this. You can probably get cheaper housing off-campus, but it will (likely) be further away from your lab and you'll miss out on getting to know people living in the on-campus housing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb) If you're on-campus, you get approximately 1 meal/day as part of the board plan. Chandler cafe is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but a bit expensive. Hameetman will likely also be open over the summer (it's new this year). Otherwise, people generally cook with a small group of people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc) Houses will have events for those living there, and a lot of people from the school year will be doing SURFs (as well as other people visiting). Common activities include exploring LA, making food, or whatever else you enjoy doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nd) There will be a facebook page for those surfing once acceptances get sent out (or there was last year, at least)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, I don't have the best perspective for those who are visiting, but it's something I guess",

There probably aren't many visiting SURFers on this sub so I was only expecting responses from Caltech students :) For Caltech students, do you stay in your normal house during the summer? (Where I go to school, all but 2 of the dorms close during the summer.)",

            "comment": "Hi! I graduated 6 years ago so not super current, but there's a lot of Techers that stay on campus over the summer (obviously) and in my house every year there would be like 2-3 SURF students who would hang out with us and we'd become friends, all the others would just hang out with other non-Caltech SURF students. We always were happy when students from not-Caltech made an effort to hang out with us, but we also never made an initial effort to hang out with them really since we were all close to each other from being in the same House. So, if you're the kind of person who feels comfortable inserting yourself into social circles, you'll prob be welcomed, but if you aren't comfortable doing that, you'll have a harder time.\n\nAlso if you DO live on campus, keep in mind houses really do have cultures, and you may enjoy hanging out in one that's different from where you're living.\n\nAlso like I said this was a while ago &amp; also only one house so YMMV a lot",

            "comment": "I did a SURF there! I'd definitely go with on-campus housing. Campus is stunning and conveniently located a few blocks from the grocery store. Dorms throw parties, although they're not as big as the Dorm Parties during the school year. I thought they were pretty effective for meeting new people. In addition, you can catch people watching shows in the lounges during off hours, and joining in isn't weird. Personally, I made the best of my friends in the communal kitchen of our dorm by complimenting his fajitas, and he in turn gave me some. They were amazing. ",

            "comment": "Having been at Caltech for a few summers (without working for most of them, however), I would say that staying on campus is a very good idea as long as you can afford it (which it seems most people can). A lot of Caltech students stay - some of them have kind of a bad attitude about summer students, but if you're not intimidated they'll get over it. I found that there were actually some decent parties over the summer, especially in Ricketts, and some things like organized trips out to the Mojave (good incentive to get to know the current students!). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe summer can be pretty outrageously hot sometimes, but fortunately the SURF months are not the hottest months of the year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou should just call Caltech housing about the possibility of staying in a double, (626) 395-6176. There are literally two people who manage this aspect of housing, plus some support staff, so it ought to be easy to get the correct answer. You can ask for Marie if the person who answers the telephone doesn't know.",

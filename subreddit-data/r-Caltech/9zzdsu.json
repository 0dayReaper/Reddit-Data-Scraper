    "postText": "Hey , I am an international student I was wondering if you would be able to answer a few of my questions about Caltech?\n\nThe best thing about your school? \n\nWorst thing about your school? \n\nWhat's the coolest course?\n\nIs there a unique course, like other colleges don't have it ?\n\nHow open is your relationship with your professors? Can you go ask them questions after a lecture?\n\nAre people more friendly or competitive? Like do people help each other with school work or it's like each with their own book\n\nHow is the social life, party scene? Like is there a lot or mostly study and Only get together once a week or so ?\n\nIs anything cool that you go outside the college for ?\n\nThis might be kinda weird but if you could give me like a rating of how much you like it there in total it would be nice.\n\nIf it's too much feel free to not answer any question, and elaborate as much as you want.",

    "postText": "Caltech didn't offer an official CS major for undergrads before 2004, so undergrads who studied CS would officially major in Engineering and Applied Science and take CS courses. If you did this, on your resume, do you list your major as \"Engineering and Applied Science,\" \"Engineering and Applied Science concentrating in Computer Science\" (or something similar), or \"Computer Science\"? I graduated in 2003 and tend to list my major as the second, although sometimes I've been listing my major as \"Computer Science\" because I've seen other pre-2004 alumni list their major as \"Computer Science\" on resumes and LinkedIn profiles, even though they couldn't have done an official CS major.",

So I wouldn't really call myself \"a CS guy before the CS option existed\".  \n\nI did program professionally for four years, but had to stop because of RSI.  Now I am in a cross-functional leadership position in a big high tech firm, but I only have that job because of the programming work I did.\n\nI remember thinking that CS 20 gave me huge advantage over many of my coworkers because it trains you to think about computation, not the programming language.  On the other hand, I felt the need to supplement what I got in class with info on compilers, OSs, and microprocessors.  I just read whatever the well-regarded undergrad textbook was on those topics and did fine.\n\nMy general advice if you want to work in industry is to take as many project classes as you can. ",

The project classes I took -- mainly CS 47, the computer graphics series, and CS 11 --  were some of my more useful and interesting classes. \n\nI consider myself a CS alumna, but I guess it's also questionable if that's really correct, because, of the CS 138 series, I only took 138a, and I did not take discrete math. I did take CS 1/2/3, CS 20,  CS 40, CS 11, operating systems, and compilers, as well as the project classes.  \n\nI don't feel that CS 20 gave me much of an advantage. I just never made the connection between theory and applying it to the real world.",

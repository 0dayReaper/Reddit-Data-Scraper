    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m not so familiar with the US admissions process (I live in the UK). I think in the UK they kind of only care about super curricular (extra curricular related directly to your subjects) but in the US they want you to be well rounded. Could anyone expand on that and give me tips for how to get accepted as a science student (I know that\u2019s vague but I\u2019m not sure what sciences I\u2019d like to do). For anyone else that got in, what did you do?",

So while being well rounded is important, Caltech *also* wants you to be sharp.",

Course rigor is very important, especially for Caltech, but showing your passion to collaborate with others to advance science is also awesome!",

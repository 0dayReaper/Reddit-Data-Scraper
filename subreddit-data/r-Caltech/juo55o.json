Any student at Caltech who has a chance of surviving Core has great independent learning skills. \n\nTo learn about Caltech's admissions process I suggest you visit the part of the Caltech website which handles undergraduate admissions. The acceptance rate will give you an idea of how difficult it is to get in. Other websites will tell you about the SAT/ACT scores one used to need to get in (now Caltech is test-optional though). On this sub you can read about how STEM ECs are usually a valuable component of an application.\n\nFor more guidance through the admissions process check out /r/applyingtocollege .",

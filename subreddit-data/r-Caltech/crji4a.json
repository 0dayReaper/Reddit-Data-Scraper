    "postText": "1) What extracurriculars would one recommend for a student with excellent grades for getting into Caltech? What extracurriculars are typically \"required\" of a student who has a good chance? What are some general traits that these students must have? (eg. spikes in terms of scientific knowledge/tech skills, overall passion for science, etc.)\n\n2) Besides general traits, what are some unique and memorable cases that you can recall? \n\nNote- I speak from the context of an international student with limited opportunities.\n\n3) How does Caltech look on students who decide to take a year off after high school to pursue their passions or partake in various activities such as volunteer service/jobs/internships and then apply?",

The most important thing that admissions wants to see is that you have interests outside of school that you are dedicated to. I\u2019ve seen people come in with all sorts of hobbies so dont feel like you need to join certain clubs to fit in.  It\u2019s better to be able to show that you\u2019ve stuck with one thing that really interests you for a while than to join a bunch of \u201cprestigious\u201d clubs for a few months just cause you think you should. \n\nAs for taking a gap year, I don\u2019t personally know anyone who has done it but I\u2019ll give the same advice thats given to people who want to take a gap year between under grad and grad - if you take a year off you need to be able to show that it was worth it. Either that you grew as a person, or gained useful skills, or did something you wouldnt otherwise have been able\n\nGood luck!",

I got into Quantum Mechanics back in middle school and so all of my passions are based around physics. I like to see that as a spike but I fear I'll come off as bookish. \n\nIf I take a gap year, I may be able to find a mentor and do some projects with them in a lab.\n\nAlso, is there anything at all that one should keep in mind for college admissions while pursuing ECs?",

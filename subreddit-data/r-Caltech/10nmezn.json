    "postText": "Hi, I am currently a laboratory technician in one of the labs on campus. Since I will be doing research in addition to my tech duties, I was wondering if anyone knows where I might be able to find scholarship or fellowship opportunities as a holder of a bachelor's degree who is not yet a graduate student, to bring funding in - for possibly encouraging the opportunity of working on my own project after building my skills a bit further. Most things I have seen are meant for graduate students or undergrads. Is anyone aware of resources meant for people who would be looking to go to graduate school but are currently working in the middle, after their bachelor's but before graduate school? Do I qualify for attempting to obtain a grant of some sort?",

But yes, if you (and a prof or postdoc, need a PhD holder on the application almost certainly) can get accepted for a research grant you can get funding for pretty much any project that is viable and worthwhile.\n\nHowever, I'll note that this sort of work is what you're expected to do in the first couple years of grad school - develop your own projects and write proposals for them. So on one hand it could be good experience for that, on the other hand it might mean you have to do even more work since you'll have to start a whole new project for your PhD if you go that route. Unless you can get accepted into the same lab or one that collaborates with you (for example you can probably have this professor on your PhD committee no matter what school you go to if they're willing to co-advise a student remotely)",

I'm not going to disagree, but this is surprising to me! 5th year PhD student in physics currently. My impression has been that it's rare for grad students to develop their own projects in their first two years of grad school, and that this would be even rarer in disciplines with a lot of lab work. I thought it might be more common in e.g. pure math, where a new project is often just one, maybe two people doing self-contained work.\n\nI also haven't heard of grad students being asked to help write proposals. The earliest I've heard was postdocs.\n\nIf this is how it functions in chem/bio, I believe you, I'm just surprised!",

Because the lab is paying for your working hours, you will have to be granted a project from PI, as a tech, to have your own research or be part of a research project.  It may create conflict of interest issues as well.  I think best way is to talk to your PI and see if...\n1. There are any funding he/she is aware of for techs\n2. There are additional research responsibilities you can take on.\n3. He would be interested in taking X project a Y and Z direction and you would love to be part of that. \n\nThe worst he/she can say is no but at the least you may be able to get exposure to new techniques/research projects that will only strengthen your resume.",

You still have to pay monthly dues though.\n\nhttps://www.athenaeumcaltech.com\n\nHuntington Gardens offer discounts on admission if you have a Caltech ID, not sure about JPL employees.\n\nIf you have a Caltech email address, you can check out other discounts here:\nhttps://discounts.bookstore.caltech.edu/login/\n\nAlso, in the Caltech bookstore, you can get discounted monthly Metro passes with a Caltech ID. I don't think JPL offers this.\n\nFor JPL discounts offers, stop by the JPL store. They have pretty awesome discounts on movie tickets and local amusement parks.",

    "postText": "Hi!! I\u2019m an undergrad going into my fourth year of my bsc in physics and trying to figure out where to go for grad school! I have been considering applying to Caltech for a while and it\u2019s kinda becoming my dream school. I want to be more sure of my choice though, because holy moly american post secondary is so expensive! I have a couple questions about grad school at caltech, if anyone\u2019s in physics that would be amazing too!\n1) How do you like life on campus, especially as someone who is not american? (I\u2019m from canada) was it easy to meet people?\n2) how much funding can you get, again, especially as someone who is not american?\n3) do you automatically get a TAship when you\u2019re a masters student?\n4) after a year of studies, can you switch from masters to PhD?\n5) is it more course or research based?\n6) do you need to apply with a supervisor in mind, or do you find a supervisor once youre already in the program?\n\nAny other general advice would be great too, thanks!!! :)",

            "comment": "I'm doing physics too, I started as a grad student last fall so hopefully I can help. \n\n1) Honestly, haven't met too many people yet which is a bit of a bummer. That might just be me so I don't want to generalize. It's certainly more difficult than meeting people in undergrad for whatever reason. The coronavirus obviously didn't help since my third quarter was spent off campus. The actual campus is nice, though.\n\n2) I think all PhD grad students get the same stipend (roughly $35K right now). I know the vast majority of people accepted are funded, I'm 99% sure that also applies to people from other countries but you could always contact graduate admissions.\n\n3) I remember hearing it's really hard to get in just for a terminal Masters degree, and if you do you probably will have to pay tuition (which is enormous). Almost everyone is doing a PhD program, and at least in my field we get the Masters along the way. As I mentioned before, I believe the vast majority of accepted students for PhD programs are funded (with funding provided either by fellowship, TAing, or research funding). If you are funded, you don't have to pay tuition. From what I understand, if you are doing physics theory you will probably need to TA at some point.\n\n4) See 3)\n\n5) Mostly research. I just finished my last required courses for my option this quarter and from there it's basically research. This could vary by department?\n\n6) When I applied I had a few advisers in mind but I didn't contact any of them prior to applying. That might have been a dumb move since I hear this recommended a lot, but I got in so hey it worked out haha. I did mention potential advisers in my written statement on the application, which I think is pretty important.",

I'm not going to lie, transitioning to grad school has been much harder for me than I thought especially what with not really meeting many people yet, but that's not Caltech's fault. \n\nThe location has a lot going for it as well, and that's saying something considering I kind of hate large cities. If you like big cities, Pasadena has stuff to do and downtown LA is not far. If you don't or want to go hiking, there's a giant National Forest right next door (literally a few miles away, a 20 mile by-air straight line from campus is a 8000' mountain pass with bighorn sheep warning signs) and quite a few other big mountain ranges within a few hours. I'm originally from California so I may be biased...\n\nI think I applied to 8 (?) schools and got into 2 (including here), almost all of which I considered to be long-shots since I could fall back on doing a 4+1 Masters at my undergrad if I didn't get in anywhere - so naturally I was pretty hyped to get in here. You probably already knew this, but I think my best advice for applications is just make sure you have one or a few potential research advisers at each institution you'd like to work with and mention them in your application statement. It's not a firm commitment.\n\nBest of luck on applications! I remember really hating doing them so yea...",

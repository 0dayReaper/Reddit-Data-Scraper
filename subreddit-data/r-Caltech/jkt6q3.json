    "postText": "I'm a high school junior not too far from Pasadena and have had a dream of getting into Caltech. I am an A- average student and went into independent study for 2 years. Am I naive to even consider Caltech? I am very interested in cellular and medical biology (among many other things) which makes Caltech my very best option.\n\nI am also considering transferring but someone said only an extremely small amount get in. No matter what, I'm going into STEM, so I would greatly appreciate any information I could get about the field and the school.",

Many Caltech students additionally have strong STEM ECs, so you should perhaps think about building your application around those as well. The people on this sub are current students and alums, not admissions officers, so we don't have much information about what exactly admits a student to Caltech.",

So I'm crossing my fingers they 'overlook' my GPA and get blown away by my essay.  I founded a philosophy (usually dealing in ethics) debate club with a teacher but don't have any physical achievements. I still have about 9 months before I apply. With the restrictions, I'm not sure what else I could do though. With such a low acceptance rate, they're expecting geniuses.",

He had trouble making friends and tried to do all the work by himself when most people collaborate on homework and/or study in groups.  He failed out after a year.",

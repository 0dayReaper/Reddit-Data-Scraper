Does anyone know how much money (in USD - yearly) an international student would have to have in order to live (a frugal life) with his wife (under an F2 visa, which means she can't work) in Pasadena while being a PhD student at Caltech? Are there any affordable places/cities close enough to the university?\n\nAny help would be highly appreciated =)",

            "comment": "Not a grad student (undergrad) but I wouldn't be surprised if you had to be very frugal. A grad student stipend isn't a lot of money (I believe janitors earn roughly the same in many places), and is really designed for one person. Pasadena isn't the most expensive place in the world (if you had to do this in Palo Alto and went to Stanford you'd be very screwed) but its also not very cheap. If your major and advisor let you do internships over the summer, that could help your income (CS internships will pay roughly 30k for a summer, and finance slightly more). You can also tutor local kids (Arcadia, which is nearby, has competitive high schools for example and people very willing to pay for math tutoring for their kid etc) and get paid in cash.",

You'd get \\~$35k pretax a year, and I know several people who do live on that with a non-working spouse. You could probably stay in Caltech owned accommodation for a couple years, which would definitely help out. You'd pay \\~$1200 in rent a month, compared to \\~$2600 a month in salary after tax/insurance. That's not luxurious, but should be enough for living expenses plus saving for car/trips back home.\n\nIf you're not living in Caltech housing, you'd either have share a flat with others if you want to be close to Caltech, or live \\~15-20 minute drive away to live on your own. For reference, a single apartment in walking distance to Caltech is \\~1700 a month, whereas you might pay \\~1100 a month for a room in 2/3 bedroom place.",

If you don't mind me asking, an unconnected question to this topic I have is: How long does each graduate course usually last at Caltech? (I took a look at the calendar and it seems that courses last less than two months in some quarters... If so aren't them super fast? Is the content seen in depth/reasonably retained by students?)",

As you can probably imagine, there is a trade-off between breadth, depth, and retention. Some professors manage that better than others. I can't speak to CMS courses, but I've been pretty happy with the graduate courses I've taken. They tend to be on specific areas, so you can go deep in them while not getting overwhelmed. Some of the undergrad courses I've TA'd suffered from trying to cover a broader range of content while still going in depth and finishing in 10 weeks.",

My experience with around 10 weeks of lecture is that usually professors just want to cover a lot of topics which end up leading to very superficial lectures. Its interesting to learn that in spite of the small duration of courses, lack of depth is not issue at Caltech =)",

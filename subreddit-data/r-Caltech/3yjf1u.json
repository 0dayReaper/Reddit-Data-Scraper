We always used to just rent the ASCIT van and pile people in if we were going to a concert or something. Getting to Santa Monica would be nearly impossible without a car, and sadly, getting to the airport is not much better.",

It is pretty easy to get to some parts of LA from campus because of the gold line. Check out that map to see if it takes you where you want. With a car, getting around is fairly easy as long as you avoid heavy traffic times. Some of my fellow grad students don't have cars but we carpool a lot together. \n\n\nI'm a first year grad student here and really enjoy the vibe of campus and pasadena so far! There are lots of great places to eat and drink, great hiking and biking and climbing really close by, and all the attractions of a big city without living in the heart of LA. Feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions :] ",

You can also get to Hollywood by train, taking the Gold Line to Union Station and then the Red Line. For everything else, you really need a car or carpooling. You can rent Zipcars on campus. ",

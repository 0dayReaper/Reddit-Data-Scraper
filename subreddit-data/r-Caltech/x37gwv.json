    "postText": "I am a prospective student and applicant (finished application, deciding if I should apply REA) and I was just wondering how the hispanic community is at Caltech. Most of my classes have been hardcore STEM APs or APs in general and advanced classes (like multivariable calculus) and I am usually the only hispanic in the class and although it does give me a sense of pride (my father calls me a 'maverick' because of that), it does get lonely at times.",

As other folks said, CLASES is the undergraduate Hispanic group. \n\nYou can check out the website at [clases.caltech.edu](http://clases.caltech.edu) to see a bit of an overview of what our org does, but our most popular events by far are the socials with Hispanic food. Our website also has the links to our other social media platforms.\n\nWe also host an annual trip to the SHPE and SACNAS national conventions, which really help our members with internship and career opportunities. Since you're like me, and are often the only Hispanic in a STEM classroom, these conferences are amazing because you're surrounded by Hispanics in STEM!\n\nIf you have any questions definitely reach out to the president or the email address listed on the site.",

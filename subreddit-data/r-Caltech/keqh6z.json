Just trying to figure it how viable the path is and if its worth spending 5 years and extra money to do.\n\nFeel free to answer even if you didn\u2019t do it but have useful info! I have found that information on the program is limited (one reddit thread claimed that usually no more than 1 student in an entire class does the program, and that Caltech was rejecting Reed students with 3.9 GPAs as they just dont have enough space for everybody), so any additional information would be great!",

There\u2019s no guarantee on getting into the 3/2 program, and it\u2019s not like a hidden back door to Caltech. I\u2019d also bet that most of the transfer students accepted likely would have been accepted as frosh (given sufficiently well written application). I\u2019m not exactly sure who the target demographic is of the program either.",

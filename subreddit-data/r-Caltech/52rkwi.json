A few or so might respond (usually professors will respond within a week, if it's later than that then they're probably just ignoring it). Don't worry if they're in the same department or whatever, it's actually a good thing because they might discuss among themselves and work out some arrangement.\n\nIt helps if you can demonstrate past research experience with publications and names of references.",

Caltech profs have no shortage of supply for talented young researchers, so if your email is just \"I'm looking for something -- anything!\", you're going to lost in the noise.  Pick out some aspects of the group's research that interests you and talk about that a little.  Connect it to something you've done in the past.  That sort of thing...",

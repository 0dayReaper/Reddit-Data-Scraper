I found the steam tunnels in my lab's building, so that will be cool. But I was wondering if anyone had some fun suggestions for parts of campus, interesting rooms/buildings, roof access? Not necessarily for hooking up, but simply for checking out things that are off the beaten path, unusual, historical, and unique to campus.\n\nThanks!",

Basically a 1/100 scale version of the famous pair of scientific instruments; primarily a test platform for detector improvements. You may need to take laser safety training to visit, I'm not sure.\n\nSpeaking of scale versions of famous instruments, do they still have the 1/10th scale version of the Hale telescope on top of Robinson? That was pretty cool, and it was easy to get access to when I was there (class of '82). You had to go talk to the person in charge, and he would have someone show you how to use it and tell you what not to do so you wouldn't break it, and then you were allowed to come in at night and use it if no one else was.",

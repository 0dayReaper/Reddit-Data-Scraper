    "postText": "Hey! I need some help planning out courses based on the course catalog. A couple of questions:\n\n- What am I allowed to double-count? For example, if I plan on double majoring, can the standard content of a second major cover the breadth content of the second major and vice versa?\n- If a course meets the reqs. of both majors, can I double count it?\n- How hard is to get approved for overloading? Based on my current plan, I'll only need to do it for one semester (and I'll only overload by ~5 credits). Can I look to get approval now?\n- What are the easiest OR funniest (as far as easy @ Caltech goes) humanities/social sciences classes? I've usually been bored by humanities/social science classes, so I'd really enjoy something that's either easy or fun or both. I wouldn't mind a more quantative SS/HUM class (e.g. accounting) if it isn't too difficult.\n\nCurrently I'm looking at Chem/CS or Chem/Math as my major options. Would greatly appreciate any advice or help.",

            "comment": "There's pretty much no point to trying to plan out your whole 4 years now, hahaha. I recognize that, maybe, some of your friends at other colleges are trying to do this; it's pretty silly for them, too.\n\nMaking a 4-year plan has two benefits: (1) give you a general sense of how much flexibility you'll have in your schedule, so you know how much to weight \"this is a fun class I want to take\", and (2) helping people graduate who are at serious risk of not graduating. You've already got (1), so now you can throw that plan away and forget about it for at least a year \ud83d\ude1b and (2) shouldn't apply to you if you're planning to double major, right? \ud83d\ude09\n\nI would also note that probably ~80% of incoming prefrosh who express an interest in double majoring, decide they don't want to by the end of their freshman year. It's easy to think that \"double major\" means \"push yourself to get the most education out of your time here\". Which isn't true: the people I know who pushed themselves the most were all single majors, who just took a bunch of deep classes (in their own discipline and some others). A double major really means \"two stamps of approval that you know a given subject\". This will only have value to you if you need, for some reason, two stamps. No grad school I've heard of cares about this, and only very very few jobs.\n\nFinally, there are two big reasons to not bother trying to make a plan now. First, what you want to study exactly, and how much you want to push yourself, is something you'll probably figure out a lot more clearly in your first two quarters or so. So wait at least until then. Second, if you wait until you're *on campus* to ask people these questions, you'll get answers from a ton of current students, who will point you to more students who have the same interests as you, etc etc. It's a much much MUCH better resource than this reddit! :)\n\nAll that said -- big congrats on getting in, you'll have a great time, enjoy the summer until then, and fwiw I really enjoyed the Philosophy of Probability class. \ud83d\ude0a There's no accounting at Caltech.",

I will definitely reconsider my current approach; i always stress about planning ahead but I guess I'll wait.\n \nThanks for the course reccomendation, by the way! Also, isn't BEM 102 an accounting class? It's listed on the course catalog so I'd like to know if the catalog on the Caltech website that I'm using is incorrect/outdated",

Math major lets you double count whatever you want. Other majors might be more restrictive. Just look this up in the catalog. For example here's what CS says:\n\n&gt;Specific courses that are explicitly required by both options only need to be taken once. For example, if both options require CS 38, then it can count for both. However, elective courses that satisfy the \u201cAdvanced CS\u201d requirement or the \u201cBreadth\u201d requirement cannot be double counted.\n\n**Overload approval:** Anecdotally, if your GPA is high, they'll let you do it, and if it's low, they might not approve it. I think I got an overload approved with a 3.7 or 3.8? And I've heard of people with lower GPAs not getting approved. \n\n**Your suggested combos:** chem/cs and chem/math have very little, basically zero synergy. If you do a chem/math or chem/cs double major you'll be spending all your time trying to fulfill the requirements for each major and you won't get any leftover schedule space to explore electives which suit your specialized interests. Honestly I'd recommend picking a major in the subject you care about most and then maybe adding in a minor if you insist on having the extra credential.\n\n**chem/math is kind of ridiculous:** For chem, I believe as a smore you're expected to do Ch 41, Ch 21, and maybe also a lab. And then for math, most people would do at least two of Ma 5, 108, 109 as smores. Doing all that as a smore would be crazy. \n\n**your hum question:** 90% of techers feel this way, just check out TQFRs and ask around once you get to tech, things will work out.\n\nAlso, if you are deciding whether to major in math, you should consider taking Ma 5a as a frosh, it's a great way to get exposure to mathematics at Caltech",

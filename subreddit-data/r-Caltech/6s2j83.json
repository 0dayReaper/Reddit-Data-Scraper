    "postText": "Obviously Caltech has made a huge name for itself in terms of STEM and research. Most people consider its main \"competitor\" MIT. Basically, Caltech is killing it.\n\nBut wherever I turn, there seems to be some odd stigma around Caltech being a \"research bubble,\" almost like a research institute rather than a college. One of my friends went there for a summer camp, and it seems like research has been talked about endlessly there (did you know we do tons of research? Are you interested in research? Fun fact: RESEARCH.)\n\nIs it even possible to get the \"college experience\" at Caltech? Or it is like an alternate universe that doesn't really follow normal people standards of what a college experience is like? Not saying that it's bad that Caltech focuses on research (in fact, I'm sure that's exactly what a lot of people want from college!!), but for me I'd like to have a college experience that at least resembles what people think of when hearing \"college experience.\"",

            "comment": "Well, I guess it is a research bubble. No point in going to Caltech if you don't want to do research, especially for science and engineering majors. There's a reason why everyone here wants to go to grad school.\n\nYou can have a normal \"college experience\" if you hang out with the right people and are not too concerned about grades. That being said, it's still pretty rare.",

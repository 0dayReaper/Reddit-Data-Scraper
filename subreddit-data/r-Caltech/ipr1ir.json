    "postText": "Has anyone done SURF or LIGO SURF, I'm a visiting student and currently looking it through. I'm wondering if you have to come up with your own research project or you pick one and pick mentors based on that. I'm a UK student going into the second year of a physics degree and worried if I come up with an idea it won't be high enough level, as I havent studied that high level of physics.",

Each time I contacted a bunch of professors, pointed to specific work (projects and papers, ideally recent) that matched my interests and asked them if they had any projects available in a similar vein or had time to discuss potential projects. Professors know that most undergrads don\u2019t have the knowledge to come up with project ideas on their own, so the ones that are interested in taking on undergrads will have project ideas ready.",

Don\u2019t be afraid to send polite follow up emails. also professors/departments will often have secretaries/administrators to help them manage things, some internet sleuthing is necessary to identify these people. Cc\u2019ing them will improve your response rate. In the case of my Berkeley surf I actually called the office and spoke to the department secretary, who then prodded the prof to email me back.\n\nI guess the other side of that is that you\u2019re not going to get responses from everyone. Don\u2019t get discouraged, cast a wide net. You just need one professor!",

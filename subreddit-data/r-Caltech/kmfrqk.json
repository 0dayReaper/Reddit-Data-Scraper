    "postText": "I\u2019m definitely committed to applying to Caltech as an undergrad next year because I find the devotion to STEM and heavy research environment to be incredibly inspiring. I\u2019ve done research in various fields of chemistry and biology over the past few years and have discovered what I really like. I adore organic chemistry but also have a strong affinity and passion for neuropharmacology and computational neuroscience. So much I\u2019d like to end up and do R&amp;D in medical science and drug therapy (I don\u2019t intend on going to medical school in the future). I\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019m considering a prospective major in CNS. Is there something more relevant that Caltech offers that I may have overlooked? \n\nThanks :)",

            "comment": "You're going to need a PhD in order to be doing r&amp;d in medical science/drug therapy. Going to Caltech for undergrad alone won't help. Plus if you want to do your PhD at Caltech then you'll be forced to go to another University since most programs (with the exception for ee or cs) don't take their own undergrads for grad school",

You want the student to see more faculties, more ideologies, etc, you want them to be exposed to more people, and you don't want schools hoarding their best people. One somewhat well known dirty secret is that increasing grad school diversity is not easy, so if someone internal (an undergrad) wants to stick around and would tick a diversity box, they're typically likelier to be accepted (obviously assuming they also pass the \"good enough\" bar, but most Caltech undergrads applying to grad schools are).",

Other administrators might have different reasoning but I've seen this in practice. I'd encourage ppl to find ppl on LinkedIn who did undergrad + PhD at the same place with no gaps. It's not very common",

Link with descriptions: [https://cce.caltech.edu/undergraduate](https://cce.caltech.edu/undergraduate)\n\nLuckily, Caltech core mostly fills up your schedule frosh year so you have time to see what you like. Realistically, you don't need to select your major until smore year. \n\nCh 1 (core) and Ch 10 (lots of chem majors take it frosh year) are good ways to get introduced to chemistry. For biology, I think you could maybe look into Bi 8 or Bi 1x. Then you can get a frosh research opportunity and this will probably further inform your decision.",

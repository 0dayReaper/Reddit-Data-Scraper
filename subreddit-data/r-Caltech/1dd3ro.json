The average distance to campus for staff is about 11 miles, about 1 hour by bike each way.  \n\nOn the other hand, this survey look suspicious. Look at the weird variations in the average distance to work for students and faculty from 2009-2012.\n\n",

Unlike faculty, staff often don't make enough to afford to buy a house in Pasadena. I'd commute, too.\nAnd I would love to see the number of survey participants each year. They do have a comment under that graph stating that 20011-2012 may be due to survey bias.\n",

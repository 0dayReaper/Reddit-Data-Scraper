    "postText": "Hi everyone, Class of 2021 early action admit here. I was pretty much set on Caltech until just recently when I was admitted to Berkeley's new MET(Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology) program, where students earn a BS in EECS and a BS in Business in 4 years.\n\nObviously there might be some bias posting here, but what do you guys genuinely think? Where would you choose?\n\nFor context, I'm definitely planning to get an MBA and a masters and/or doctorate in engineering at some point or another.\n\nEdit: The price tags are almost identical, since I'm receiving need-based financial aid at both places.",

            "comment": "When I was a senior in high school, I had to decide between EECS at Berkeley and engineering at Caltech. I'm now studying computer science at Caltech, with some \"business\" classes thrown in. Here are my two cents:\n\n* You can double-major in Caltech's business-major equivalent pretty easily. That's what it was designed for. That said, it's not a business major so much as a *finance* major: the target audience is those who want to work at hedge funds, investment banks, or quantitative trading firms...not become managers at corporations.\n\n* Berkeley is much larger and has a much more diverse student population. If that's important to you, go to Berkeley. It's a no-brainer. Caltech is basically a monastery for science nerds.\n\n* During what little time you have outside of academics and research, Caltech will pamper you. It's incredibly small and incredibly well-funded. Need money to start a club? Write a proposal and \\**ka-ching*\\* it's yours. Want to watch a pay-per-view event? The Senior Director of Student Activities and Programs will screen it for you and your friends on one of the giant televisions at his house, with food and drinks thrown in. The perks are tremendous...but most of the time you'll be too busy to take advantage of them.\n\n* Caltech has perhaps, on average, the smartest students in the country, but from what I've seen the EECS students at Berkeley are top-notch as well. My friends who studied EECS at Berkeley would have done well at Caltech, MIT, or any other school in the United States. Frankly, they were more competent than most of the students I knew who went to HYPSMC. If you end up attending Berkeley, you'll be in good company.\n\n* What would you study if you attended Caltech? Your quality of life will heavily depend on which major you choose. Electrical engineering at Caltech: a *lot* of work, classes that expect you to do most of the learning on your own, many hours spent in the Moore subbasement. Computer science at Caltech: less work, easier classes, companies asking for your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 24/7. That said, I'm not sure how either of them compare to EECS at Berkeley.\n\n* Both Caltech and Berkeley have top-notch engineering programs. You'll receive a fantastic education no matter which one you attend, so your choice may come down to non-academic considerations. I highly recommend visiting both schools to see what they're like before making a decision. Specifically, I highly recommend going to Caltech's PFW because the students here can be pretty fuckin' weird. And I wholeheartedly include myself in that description.\n\nGood luck!",

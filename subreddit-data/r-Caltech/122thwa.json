You might be able to squeeze the trip onto one one-way ticket, but it will cost at most a $7 day pass.\n\nThe more straightforward way is to take the FlyAway Bus to Union Station and then the Gold Line into Pasadena. I used to walk to campus from the Lake Station, but it's also possible to ride local buses.",

I haven't touched calculus in about a year and I've also never done proof\\-based math anything. I saw something about a Math 0 on the Internet but I'm not entirely sure what that's about. Beyond reviewing old concepts \\(I've only done up to AB because that's all my school had\\), is there anything else I can do?",

The important thing is to learn how to do proofs, taking Math 0 over the summer (the school will email you about it) is a good idea.\n\nSeperately, since you\u2019ve only taken Calculus up to AB, if you haven\u2019t done much integration before, that would be a good math technique to pick up over the summer, because you\u2019ll be expected to know it from the moment you step foot on campus for physics classes and such. I don\u2019t remember where AB left off...",

Rather, it covers analysis. I hear it\u2019s gotten a bit better since Katz switched to other classes, but not that much.",

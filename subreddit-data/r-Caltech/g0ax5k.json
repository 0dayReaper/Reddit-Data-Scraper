    "postText": "I am not sure if I am the only one, but I applied for a graduate program at Caltech last December for the Fall 2019 semester and still haven't heard anything back from the graduate admissions office. I was told to expect an answer no later than 1st of April, and from then on I was given the cold shoulder. I haven't heard back from them since and they don't answer either emails or phone calls. It is honestly a joke at this point. I am not going to go as low as to ask for a refund as there may be a reason for the delay and could be caused by the current pandemic. All I can say is that it has been nothing but unprofessional from their side. If anyone has or has had a similar experience please share.",

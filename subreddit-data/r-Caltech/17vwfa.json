My son is very interested in science and math and wanted to see as much of Caltech as possible. We plan to print out the online tour map and walk around campus since we're too late for the tour as well. \n\nEven if you can't help out with the JPL, any hints about what to see would be appreciated. He's looking ahead to either Caltech or MIT. Thanks so much!",

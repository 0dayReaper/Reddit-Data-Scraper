    "postText": "I want to major in CS. Double majoring is pretty common in other universities, so how is it at Caltech (besides humanities double majors e.g. BEM)? I've been looking through the option requirements. I noticed that MechE has fewer requirements than other options like ACM. Is it feasible to double major in MechE and CS? If it isn't how is double majoring in CS and ACM? There seems to be a lot of requirements for majors at Caltech...",

            "comment": "Doubling is generally pretty hard to pull off at tech except between certain major pairs depending on the amount of overlap between majors in addition to their bulk unit requirements. Neither of the pairs you name are particularly common in my experience (I'm sure someone closer to those fields will jump in below though). \n\nMechE courses tend to be pretty under-united (take more time than advertised) from what I gather and the major has very little overlap with CS. ACM is a lot of work even at the advertised units but might have a little bit more overlap. \n\nDoubling at tech may not be what you may think and isn't something anyone does for the hell of it; lots of people come here thinking they will double and quickly drop the idea or switch which majors when they get real introductions to material and workloads. It's almost certainly more valuable to approach tech with the idea you'll major CS and shoot for a double if you get the chance and it feels manageable/is what you actually turn out to be interested in than to plan ahead on doubling.",

Although you didn't mention *why* you want to double major, which is really the most important information.\n\nRemember that you don't have to be working toward a degree in a subject outside your major to take as many classes as you like in it :)",

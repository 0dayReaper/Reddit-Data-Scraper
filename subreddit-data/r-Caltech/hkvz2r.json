    "postText": "Hey!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrefrosh here - I was wondering how many mistakes one could make on the placement and diagnostic exams without either not placing out or having an extra class. I know it's not a big deal, but it would just be nice to know anecdotally how large a margin of error there is.",

In short, it could vary if they change things year to year, but if you write the exam you should submit it, since even if you think you did poorly there's still a chance of placing out.",

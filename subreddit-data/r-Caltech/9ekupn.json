    "postText": "Prefrosh here; super excited to be on campus in two weeks :) \nI was wondering if I should try to join the supersection for Ph 001A. What are the main differences between the rest of the sections and the supersection? Will joining the supersection help me get more out of the course?  Is section number an indicator of difficulty? (I.e. section 5 is more difficult than section 4 and so forth?) For context only, I got a 5 on the AP Physics 2 test and a 7 on the IB Physics test. \nThanks for any help!",

            "comment": "The middle sections (I believe 3-8) of Ph1a are all exactly the same in difficulty, just different Rec TAs. My personal opinion (I was in a supersection for the class way back when) is that whichever rec you're in makes no difference at all. Your homeworks are exactly the same-- it's just that that small block of time each week in rec will cover very slightly more advanced topics. So just go with whatever section the physics department has placed you in, imo.",

Different TAs will have different styles that work for some people better than others, so if you're not happy with your initial assignment, show up at some other recs and find one you like.  You can officially switch until drop day.  I didn't do this until third term my frosh year and I really regretted not doing it sooner once I realized how helpful a good recitation could be.",

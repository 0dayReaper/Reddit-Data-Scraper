    "postText": "I'm an international student starting my undergraduate at Fall 2021. I am going to a small state school which is not very prestigious, but has a moderately robust Physics program. I am interested in doing a SURF after my sophomore year. I wanted to know if the reputation of undergraduate school matters for visiting students while selecting a candidate for SURF. If I have the required grades and good recommendation letters, will the reputation of my school be held against me?",

            "comment": "I was just admitted into SURF from a very small liberal arts college, so I'd say no. \n\nI think the biggest thing is getting in touch with the mentor you choose for your research (~ the dec/nov before the summer you want to research) and working closely with them to write a good proposal. I think it's honestly ultimately their decision as to whether or not you are admitted, though you do still need to fulfill the other requirements of the application (letters, personal statement, etc)\n\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "Hi ! \n\nI\u2019m very interested in the 2 year graduate program as I intend to do a PhD at GALCIT. My questions in bullet points:\n\n1.) What is the common quality of the students? I\u2019m asking this because I\u2019d like to know what it takes to be successful and stand out amongst all other applicants for the program. \n\n2.) Did you guys already have the idea what projects you are going to work on before going into the program?? \n\n3.) If so, what are you advices on how to build a sharp vision of what you want to do in field? I am already in my first semester of a mechanical degree( a master, I did physics bachelor with an average gpa)  I have never thought about what speciality and specific research I should focus on or having some unique insight; all I know is: okay next year I\u2019m going to take dynamics and control systems, and then in the final year I\u2019ll be interested in propulsion. As you can see I only have a very general and vague idea about aerospace engineering, not to mention I know what I\u2019m going to specify in.. Therefore, I\u2019m seeking advice on how to think of and where to look relevant projects. \n\n4.) What are the books that you think they have big impact on you as a student in engineering and research engineer? Or even, your world view and values on every aspect of life? \n\n5.) frankly I\u2019m only an average studnet, I feel like an imposter just to thinking about applying to Caltech, but the other side of me do not want to give up. Do you think I\u2019m just frittering away my time if my gpa is just meh ? I have one experience in research and I can see how competitive the people are. \n\nI\u2019ve heard about the collaborative culture at Caltech and everyone\u2019s actually dedicated to their study. I\u2019m super jealous of this as I can hardly find a buddy at university to study and work hard together. \n\nBig thanks to you! \n\nJames",

            "comment": "Hey there James. I'm not aerospace (I'm electrical), but Caltech is pretty small so there's no guarantee you'll get a quick response from someone in a specific program! If you do, all the better.\n\n1) This is probably the toughest of your questions to answer. If anything, I'd say Caltech students tend to be a bit more inquisitive than the average student.\n\n\n2) It's good to brainstorm project ideas, but also be ready to pivot to something different. It's likely that you'll be assigned some projects based on grant proposals that were started before you joined. Then you (the researcher) can evolve those into new exciting projects ideas.\n\n\n3) This will all depend on the specific lab you join, which is the biggest decision you make in grad school. The capabilities, interests, collaborations, and equipment of that lab group will guide what you work on.\n\n\n4) I don't have specific book recommendations because we are in different fields. I did once chat with a guy in a medical imaging lab, who said a bunch of new students always read this mega-thick book on MRI before joining that specific lab, and that it was a real waste of time! Better to study topics as needed as you go. You'll still take classes here and there to expand your general knowledge.\n\n\n5) Average GPA is fine. It may make getting into a grad program more difficult, but once you're in it truly does not matter. Try to get good letters of rec and establish a connection with the lab you want to join before applying. It's not uncommon to have a \"job interview\" of sorts with the PI of the lab you want to join. If someone at your current school personally knows people at Caltech, don't be afraid to have their personal reference get your foot in the door.\n\nGood luck!",

Competitiveness, how I can stand out as an applicant (how to be a good applicant), things I can do now to help my chances, what do they look for, etc. Thank you in advance!",

Kind of ironic that this program is for first gen students when these things are not obvious to exactly first gen students...\n\nAppreciate the response.",

Also be prepared to email several professors, most will probably not respond.\n\nAs for the email, the exact formating is not super important. What is important is that you give specific reasons as to why you are interested in their research and talk about something their lab is working on right now, how you could make a contribution, and why you're qualified. You can figure out what they're currently working on using their recent publications.",

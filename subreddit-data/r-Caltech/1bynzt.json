    "postText": "hello, I'm a high School senior who currently on the waitlist. And knows his chances of getting off the waitlist. Which sticks because Caltech has been my first choice school since I was in 9th grade and I visited the campus to find rocks sorted by geological age and banner hung between olive trees Proclaiming \"This is a Test\". But, I was wondering if anyone here might have been in the same situation, and how they went about getting off. Also, off topic, but why hasn't anyone done a prank of turning the water in a MIT fountain bright orange? Thanks!",

That year a lot of people were pulled off the list. Hopefully with a little luck same will happen to you too. If not, there's always grad school applications :)",

    "postText": "So, I'm a prospective student. Went to a recent info session in ATL, pretty uneventful. They emailed me a survey of their presentation. I filled it out with all my various complements and critiques, but at the end, I decided to thank them with some \"relaxing music\". If any of you know the admissions, please try to find out if someone saw/got a laugh out of this. I feel like no one would ever expect it. If they need a name to confirm, tell them Mr. Mahaffey says hello.",

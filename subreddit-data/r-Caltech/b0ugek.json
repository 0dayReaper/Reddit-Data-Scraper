    "postText": "There's A LOT of pressure on people to become more \"normie\"/normal (and less quirky) over time, and I sometimes fear that the strong culture feels also get \"lost\" over time. There are some aspects of the school that really do seem more exciting than the more \"normie\" real world.",

It seems to be very dependent on your environment after graduation; people who stay in academia or engineering often embrace who they are and stay quirky, while people who go into less academic roles become less quirky over time.\n\nAdmittedly, I have no clue which direction is causal (do quirky people choose academia? Or does a less academic environment make people less quirky?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't really worry about it though, both can be great and you'll find like-minded friends and coworkers.",

All of my friends were from Pasadena college or just lived in LA, with the exception of a few people.\n\nEven though I wasn\u2019t so intrenched in the school culture, even I became kind of brainy and \u2018quirky.\u2019  It doesn\u2019t stick though - once you move somewhere else you\u2019ll mold yourself into the new environment.

People move toward the normal because they enjoy building a community with their normal friends. If you're not into that, move to a big city and find your people.",

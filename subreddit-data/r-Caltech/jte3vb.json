    "postText": "I'm in year 1 of my IB taking Physics, Chemistry, and Math AA at a Higher Level. I want to be a physicist someday, My academics are currently going pretty well and my predicted scores will be pretty good, and I have not taken SAT yet, but from my practice, I think I will do pretty well on that too. But my extracurriculars are lacking, I am from Nepal and I don't have any olympiad experience, but I am planning to take a few college-level courses and also get a research internship at a local university here. I did STEM seminars at my school with Physicists and Astronomers, and also volunteer to teach STEM subjects at a marginalized school here, and also creating various workshops at this school. Currently, I am working on creating a \"Maker Space\" for this school, but other than that, I really don't have anything else going on. For someone who will surely go to Grad school, I am not sure how \"where\" I get my degree matters, But Caltech is my dream school, so any tips on betterment would be beneficial for me.",

            "comment": "You know the reality, of course: it is unlikely that you will get in. This is true of everyone, even those in the US, and it is unfortunately even more true for you. I say this as someone who attended Caltech, and who had worked quite a lot in Nepal for research.\n\nThat being said, anything you do to increase the chances of getting into Caltech will also increase the chances of you getting in somewhere else that can propel you to a PhD (possibly even one at Caltech). Here are some suggestions:\n\n(1) Create a website where you blog about STEM. Make sure it looks awesome, and pick scientific topics/articles to write about. You can then cite this in your eventual application, and will have a demonstrated record of your commitment and your English ability. You can also email the authors of scientific studies to ask them questions - they will probably be excited.\n\n(2) Ace those exams. The closer you can get to a perfect score on both IB and SAT, the better your chances. If you have really excellent scores you will stand out.\n\n(3) Line up people who will make really good reference letter writers. Faculty from local universities especially.\n\n(4) Look into other awesome schools and be prepared to apply to a lot of places. Caltech is great. You know where else is great? MIT, Georgia Tech, Harvard, Princeton, University of Texas at Austin, Cornell, McGill, NUS and NTU (Singapore), etc etc etc. Any of these places could provide great classes, great research opportunities, and springboard you to a PhD.\n\nGood luck",

Of course I can't say that you're going to get in, but I think if you ace your exams and write some good essays you have a good shot. Just make sure to really showcase your passion and uniqueness in your essays. Good luck!",

But best of luck in all of your studies!",

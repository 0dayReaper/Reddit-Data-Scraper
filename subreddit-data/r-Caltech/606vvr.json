    "postText": "Hello! My brother recently got accepted to Caltech. He's super nervous as he feels like he will get left behind in the material since he's never had a solid way of studying. How do you guys study? Do you go all out and just pull long days or all nighters? Or do you play it conservative and only put in a few hours to keep from getting mentally exhausted or burnt out?\n\nAny help will be appreciated! Thanks! ",

            "comment": "Grad student here (did my undergrad at Berkeley). Personally, I worked my ass off in high school, but I was also insanely inefficient. My first 2-3 years of undergrad were largely a process of getting better and better at learning, while still working hard. I think this is true for many people.\n\nFor your brother's situation, not \"knowing how to study\" is not necessarily a bad thing. It can be *good* if it means he doesn't have his mind made up about a recipe for success. The danger is only in arrogance: if he thinks he can get by without reading the book, going to class, doing the homeworks, and studying for exams, he's wrong. (Unless your last name happens to be Euler or Gauss.)\n\nSo, if your brother is *nervous* about coming here, then I would guess that arrogance isn't an issue.\n\nThat said, the workload is demanding here. From what I've seen, few people \"play it conservative\" in terms of studying. I can't say for certain, but I imagine that all nighters are rare. I learned in my first year at Cal that getting between 7 and 8 hours of sleep resulted in optimal learning \"throughput\", at least for me. Your brother will hopefully figure out what works well for him, wherever he ends up going.",

            "comment": "Core is the great equalizer--- it makes everyone realize they're shitty at something. If your brother got in, he can handle the course load, though it is heavy. I wouldn't be worried about being left behind on material previously, Core will catch him up. \n\nEveryone just finds what works for them. I know a lot of people who have a very consistent schedule of studying and get all their work done with a constant effort but less in one day. I also know a lot of people who don't do any of the work for a class until the night before it is due and then do a 9+ hour marathon session of learning all the material and then doing the set. Sometimes this ends poorly (with an all nighter, not finishing the set, doing poorly on the set, or the worst case--- pulling an all nighter just to do poorly on a set because you didn't finish), other times it's fine. Your mileage may vary. For me personally, I do a mixture of both. For the classes that I'm more interested in or need to put more work into, I'll try to do reading every day. Otherwise, I find it mostly sufficient to attend lecture and then read what I feel I'm weak on before I do the set. ",

            "comment": "It really depends on the workload. When you're a frosh on P/F you can study a little and mostly scrape through depending on how well you did on those subjects in high school. You have those two terms to get adjusted to what studying techniques work best for *you* because you don't have to worry about grades (you pretty much cannot fail any core classes other than Ch1 as long as you turn your work in).\n\nBy the time you get to actually being on grades most people have a sense for what kind of studying works best for them. It also varies depending on the major; bio majors will necessarily study differently from, say, math majors.",

            "comment": "Sophomore here! I've personally got through high school without needing to study much either. The first year of Caltech a bit stressful, but it REALLY helped me for the current year because of pass/fail. It let me figure out what I should be doing to STOP PULLING ALL NIGHTERS, because that's what ended up becoming my situation. I've managed to piece together a study pattern of 4-5 hours a day, with an occasional longer night (and sometimes an all-nighter) which might be caused by something I might struggle with. These sessions come with short breaks in between (Redditing). Of course, if your brother decides to take more classes later, he might end up having to pull some anyways later because the courseload becomes heavier as you progress in your major (and if you overload your schedule). Overall though, he got into Caltech, which means that everything will be doable, and he has until sophomore year to get his gears oiled! I wish him all the luck!",

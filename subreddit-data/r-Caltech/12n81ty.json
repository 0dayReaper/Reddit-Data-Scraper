    "postText": "I am looking for someone who can translate the American education and legal system in regards to applications, and whether I would be applicable to international student programs, whether my citizenship is relevant to that (I was born in California, but I have been raised almost my entire life in England) and anything else related (requirements etc.) If anyone has any small piece of information they could impart that would be more than helpful. If anything I have said is unclear please ask me to specify, it would be no trouble.",

            "comment": "Possible dated information (10 + yrs), but I used to have work study in the Financial Aid office, and this was the gist back then. All students accepted will have 100% of demonstrated financial need met (loans, grants, work study, etc).  Domestic students statistically had lower FinAid need values.  Hence, the FinAid pool goes further with more domestic students.\n\nTL;DR: Acceptance rate for domestic applicants is higher than international. Back then, FinAid suggested any applicant with dual citizenship apply as an American.\n\nAs far as interpreting international academic records vs US definitions- not a problem  There was plenty of understanding of int'l systems, certainly a major system like UK levels.\n\nAlso, for domestic applicants, there's less support admin required from the campus (arranging visas, etc.) That said, the Intl Center has some great support resources for all students. (I needed to get a drivers license, for example, and they had good instructors on a student-level budget.)\n\nHappy to hear if there's more recent advice, though. Best of luck on your applications!",

You can also use their other resources - but you won\u2019t need a visa as long as you have an American passport - and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll need to get one.",

I know there are a lot of 2 hour parking but I don't know how enforced that time limit is.\n\nAlso, I know you can buy a $60/month parking pass, but I'd prefer not to do that if possible.",

I'm looking to buy a bike but in the meantime I need somewhere to park when I work during the day. But yeah, I don't want to pay for a pass because presumably I won't need it in a few weeks.",

You're going to have enough other crap to worry about with moving, fighting for free parking might not be worth it.\n\nNot sure if it's still around, but Caltech used to offer people who didn't drive 3 daily permits a month for free if you signed some stuff in the parking office. I used that when I biked to campus, but didn't want to bother on the absolute hottest days or when it was pouring rain (honestly too dangerous with the drivers in Pasadena).",

However, these spots are very popular and likely to be filled by 9 am. \n\nAdditionally, there's a small stretch of street parking on Del Mar Blvd (between Michigan Ave and Cordova Ave) where you can park from 9 am-4 pm. Note the sign \"No Parking 7 am-9 am and 4 pm-6 pm\" on that stretch of Del Mar, which is pretty strictly enforced. If you're willing to move your car before 4 pm, that's a pretty great spot to park. \n\n* By 4 pm though, you're likely to find street parking on the stretches of California and Wilson mentioned previously. Or 2 hour parking, if you're only planning to stay until 5 pm.",

Any laptop other than a Chromebook should be powerful enough for any work you'll need in your classes.\n\nI wouldn't get a gaming laptop; get something portable with a long battery life. You'll be bouncing between classes, the library, friends' rooms, etc. Having something that weighs &gt;5lbs sucks.",

If you do end up needing something in a hurry, Best Buy/Target or Amazon will get you going pretty quickly.\n\nIf you already have a Chromebook or an older laptop, just use that for a little bit to get a feel for what your routine will be like.  Then decide.",

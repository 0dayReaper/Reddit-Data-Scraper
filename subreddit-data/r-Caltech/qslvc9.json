    "postText": "Hi! I'm a prospective international first-year student.\n\nHere [https://www.quora.com/Is-100-a-good-TOEFL-score-for-Caltech-and-MIT,](https://www.quora.com/Is-100-a-good-TOEFL-score-for-Caltech-and-MIT) I read that the Caltech requirement for TOEFL is 110. I'm interested if this is really cut-off because I haven't seen any post here. \n\nIf you saw someone who was accepted with a lower score, let me know, please. Also, if someone was accepted with Duolingo, what score did you submit?  It really will help because I'm from a low-income family, and paying to retake TOEFL will be a financial burden for us.\n\nThanks!",

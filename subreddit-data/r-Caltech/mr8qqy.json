    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019ve heard that there are placement tests at Caltech and was wondering what I should expect. I don\u2019t plan on placing out of physics or chemistry, but I heard you want to do well on one of the math placements to start at multi variable calculus level. For context, I took AP Calc BC sophomore year and multivariable calculus/differential equations/linear algebra junior year. I haven\u2019t done calculus in a while, so I was wondering if it\u2019s worth to brush up so I get placed correctly.",

I'm a current frosh that actually got placed \"behind\" in math (for context I had only taken Calc AB, but I know others who had taken more advanced classes as well) and going through those extra classes I was forced to take first and second terms was hell. Honestly probably not the best person to talk to about placing out of classes, but take this as sort of a warning that you shouldn't take the placement exams _too_ lightly because you can actually be placed in remedial courses :')",

You need to get that mode of thinking active again, and either it's easy (suggesting that your recall is fine) or it's not (and you'll really want that time to review further before the time pressure of the subsequent class kicks in).",

If you do well on the diagnostic, you get placed in regular Math1a. If you do well on the PLACEMENT, you can skip math1a, and have the option to place out of 1b and 1c too by taking additional tests (to my understanding)\n\nOn a side note: are you sure section 1 is the same as regular math1a? Talking to people in the regular class, it seemed to me like our sets were extremely different and had little similarity.",

            "comment": "There\u2019s actually two kinds of placement tests, diagnostics and placement exams. Everyone takes the diagnostics in math, physics, and writing; they\u2019re just to assess whether you might need some extra help in those respective subjects. Doing as well as you can on these is a good idea because the remedial classes aren\u2019t the most exciting. On the other hand, if you actually do need the extra help, Caltech does provide it which is good. These diagnostic tests don\u2019t let you pass out of the class, but there is a chance you\u2019ll get put into the supersection, which is basically a zero extra time commitment part of the class where you do more interesting work in the subject instead of additional standard work with the TA.  \n\nThe placement tests on the other hand exist for math, physics, CS, and chemistry. These tests are entirely optional but do allow you to skip a class. A lot of people do the CS1 (intro cs in python) and Ph1a (mechanics with calculus) placement tests, and some place out of those courses. This is a good option if and only if you really learned the material in high school or otherwise, as Caltech classes tend to be pretty hardcore. 20-30 people on average pass the Ph1a and cs1 placements every year. There are also placements for Ph1b, ch1a, Ma1abc, ma2, and ma3 but far fewer people tend to take or pass these. You can also completely ignore the placement tests if you just want the regular courses Caltech offers. Importantly, you don\u2019t get any credit for the classes if you place out, you just get to start with more advanced courses.\n\nEdit: I hadn\u2019t seen your original question, can add some info because I had the same math schedule in high school. The math placements are actually a bit weird because Caltech doesn\u2019t do your standard math course setup. Ma1a is proof based calculus, ma1b is linalg, but you can choose to take a proof based track which is much better if you\u2019ve already taken linalg, and ma1c is multi variable, but again there\u2019s a proof based track that is very cool if you already know multi. I think it comes down to if you\u2019ve taken a proof based math course before, since the math at Caltech is a lot proofier than you may have seen. If you\u2019ve done proofs at high levels, then yeah try to place out. If not, you\u2019ll definitely get something out of Ma1abc, and I personally took all three and don\u2019t particularly regret it. \n\nE2: Also, due to the way courses are scheduled at Caltech, starting at a multi variable level would just mean you don\u2019t have a regular (ie ma1ab) math course until third term (you can def add another one though). Classes are usually offered only one of the three terms.",

Is it a harder way?Typically yes, with maybe a small exception if you\u2019ve done a lot of proof based math and really dislike doing computational work (ie integrating by hand or doing some matrix crunching). If you haven\u2019t taken any proof based math or had significant exposure to it (maybe through math extracurriculars), it\u2019s probably worth it to take Ma1a. On the other hand, if you plan to take as little math as possible at Caltech (which is still a lot of math), you could conceivably avoid proof courses at all costs, but honestly this is probably more work than it\u2019s worth. \n\nI\u2019d also generally recommend a proof based math course at some point just because they\u2019re interesting (Ma6a is a good example, intro to discrete math), but jumping into a higher level course without some fundamentals will be challenging, hence why it\u2019s a good idea to start with ma1a",

I thought the same sort of thing, that there\u2019s no way I should place out of any classes at Caltech because everyone would always talk about how extraordinarily difficult Caltech is. I very much regret my decision.\n\nI was in the same boat as you in terms of math classes taken in high school. I wish I could go back in time and place out of Ma 1abc (and probably Ma 2, too, but I\u2019m a frosh so I don\u2019t know for sure)\u2014huge waste of time, all review. Same with Ph 1ab... If you\u2019ve taken Physics C: Mechanics and Physics C: E&amp;M, do yourself a favor and place out of those classes. Don\u2019t waste your time like I did. They\u2019re standard intro classes. \n\nBasically, just take every placement test you possibly can. If you place out, you deserve to place out. I remember I was mainly concerned that I\u2019d place out but somehow be behind the people in the other classes I\u2019d take instead. I now know that would not have been true at all. As everyone\u2019s saying, there is no downside to taking them. So take all of them and do your best. Study for them if you need to. It\u2019s so worth it.",

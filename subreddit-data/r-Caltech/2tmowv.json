    "postText": "The recent news of the graduate student's suicide saddened me and my wife. I was a graduate student at Caltech, and my wife was an undergrad. During our respective tenures I knew of one student suicide and she knew of at least one (the other was likely but not certain).\n\nAs the title of this post says, we know how tough it can be, from both the internal and external pressure. If you're interested in talking with someone who has experienced the pressures first hand, please send me a PM.\n\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1 (800) 273-8255.",

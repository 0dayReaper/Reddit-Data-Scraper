    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm interested in applying to Caltech this year for a Masters in Space Engineering. I read an article on their website saying that the GRE scores will not be asked on an application for 29 out of 31 divisions for the academic year 2021-22 due to COVID-19. \nHowever I don't see the same reflected on their application checklist yet, so I'm wondering if anyone has confirmation or any other information regarding this situation. Thanks.",

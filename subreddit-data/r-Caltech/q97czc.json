    "postText": "I   am currently applying for the Mechanical Engineering graduate program at California Institute of Technology.  I am facing some problems when I   am trying to write my institution name in the application. The name of my institution is 'Bangladesh University of Engineering and   Technology',  the abbreviated form is BUET.  In the Educational  Information section, I  can only type up to 'Bangladesh University of  Engin' most probably due to the character limit in your application  form. I am facing a similar problem in the  Letter of Recommendation  section.\n\nI have contacted their grad office ([gradofc@caltech.edu](mailto:gradofc@caltech.edu)) but haven't got any reply. Have anyone faced similar problem? What should I do?",

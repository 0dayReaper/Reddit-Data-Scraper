Are visitors allowed on campus (not a tour) to just check out the campus during these times of covid?   I just want to make sure before we show up this week and get turned away because of visitors not being allowed at this time.  Thanks!",

For undergrad focus, main change would be to explore the undergrad houses a bit more (between stops 4 &amp; 5, north and south of the Olive Walk. Avery, the 8th house (YMMV) is just north of stop 28 on this guide.)   \nhttps://gradoffice.caltech.edu/documents/6351/self-guided\\_tour\\_letter-sized\\_booklet2\\_march2016.pdf",

Obviously Caltech has an indoor mask requirement, but as long as you're not at a large gathering they don't seem to care much about masks outdoors. Some people do anyway but there's plenty who don't.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve always heard that CalTech is known for having the \u201cparty nerds\u201d crowd. I\u2019ve been wondering if the stories are exaggerated, or only true for a minority of the student body, perhaps.\n\nSpecifically, I\u2019m curious about things like premarital sex, alcohol and drugs and profanity. (Especially the first one).\n\nFor context, CalTech was always my dream school, although I couldn\u2019t even apply for undergraduate due to various circumstances. I\u2019ll relatively soon be graduating and am considering CalTech for my Masters/PhD. However, especially with recent events, I\u2019ve realized how much I dislike being alone.\n\nIt might be my last chance to make friends and try dating and looking for a potential life partner. So, I\u2019m curious what the culture is on campus and how many other people have similar values.\n\nTo clarify, I\u2019m not ultraconservative or anything. I don\u2019t mind if you do drugs, drink alcohol, or cuss every other word. I won\u2019t hold it against you, you\u2019ll still likely be a friend, I just won\u2019t do so myself. (This would however be a turn off for a potential spouse).\nMy greatest concern is that I would potentially try dating someone and enter into the relationship with different expectations, potentially breaking someone\u2019s heart, and/or my own.\n\nSorry if my question was vague or roundabout. I\u2019d appreciate if any students or alumni could enlighten me regarding the campus culture. Thank you in advance!",

Very few American universities have rules against premarital sex, and the ones that do are the ones that are extremely religiously-affiliated.  Moreover, you can't be *arrested* for premarital sex anywhere in the U.S.\n\nAs for your actual question, people like you aren't in the majority at Caltech, but there are plenty of them, and traditionally they get along with everyone else just fine.\n\nIf you're worried about dating someone who doesn't share your views, well, that's the sort of thing you find out when you date someone.\n\nThat said, grad students tend to be pretty siloed off from the rest of the student body, whether at Caltech or elsewhere.  The grad experience is less like college and more like just having a job where you socialize with your coworkers a little more than average.",

I attribute this to the student body understanding that nerds are all weird in their own ways, being nerds themselves. As an UG, I tended to think that the graduate students were more \u201cnormal\u201d since they came from different universities with a broader atmosphere. There weren\u2019t too many formal non-academic interactions between UGs and grads. The places I\u2019ve met grad students were during new student orientation, extracurriculars (I dated one I met through this), and random parties that undergrads would invite grad students to. The drinking culture as a whole isn\u2019t strong and pressured, though I think profanity is another story lol. At parties, no one would look at you funny if you said you needed to bounce to finish homework sets.\n\nI think graduate school is best determined by how well you fit in the lab and what your interests are since you\u2019ll be spending the most time with your department and not really be involved in the \u201cculture\u201d since that\u2019s more of a UG thing, but overall I think Tech is more conservative than other schools.",

I think the percentage of people partaking in these activities is smaller than at other schools, but it\u2019s definitely present in the undergraduate body. I\u2019m not quite as sure about grad students, but I would have to assume it\u2019s prevalent there as well, especially given that most grad students are from other institutions that aren\u2019t quite as nerdy as Caltech, so they might have had more exposure to the fun college culture. \n\nRereading your title, I\u2019m pretty sure there aren\u2019t many \u201cTraditional Values\u201d at Caltech throughout the student population. However, if you get a chance to do some sort of visit (or virtual experience), definitely do it so you can ask more people about specific things you want to know more about.",

If this was Texas, it might be different.\n\nTo answer the underlying question directly, yes there are religious and conservative people at Caltech.

I often describe Caltech as an ascetic, almost monastic experience, but that describes the serious study aspect of it, definitely not the sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll aspect. \n\nAlso note that there are generally no Masters terminal degrees; PhD only. The fact that you're contemplating this dimension of \"culture\" as a significant factor in deciding where to go indicates that you are probably not a good fit.

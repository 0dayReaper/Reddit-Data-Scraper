    "postText": "Hi! I am planning to apply to Caltech in the regular action cylce and It is the last college left that I did not submit my application. After getting deferred from MIT's early action, I looked more carefully into Caltech with a different perspective than before and I am genuinely interested in the school. But I have to admit that I am a terrible essay writer and I truly want to try my best in the Caltech prompts. Would anyone like to talk with me to share their experiences in Caltech and provide some guidance with my essays?",

Take a few days in between writing and make sure to have other people read them. Nothing better than a fresh set of eyes.",

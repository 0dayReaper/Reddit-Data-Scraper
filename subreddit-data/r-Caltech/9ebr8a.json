    "postText": "*Background*\n\n\nHi! Im a HS senior, and I'm considering applying EA to Caltech next month. From what I've read in guides, seems like a good fit for me, I like small classes and theoretical physics, it seems like a suuuuper nerdy school which is a huge plus for me (only super-nerd at my school, gets lonely). I read somewhere that y'all will talk about weird and wacky physics over dinner and that was the point at which I was like yup this is me. \n\n\n*Question*\n\n\nBut before I use an early on it, I just want to know your opinion and what sort of student would be a fit for Caltech. I want to know for two reasons:\n\n1. Am I a good fit?\n\n2. If so, what aspects of myself should I highlight on my app, for example, I have two essays rn, one about growing up as a maker, and the other one about fighting obesity and losing a lot of weight, so if Caltech really cares about continued interest in STEM above all, I might go for the former, and so on\n\nI hope this makes sense and that my head is in the right place in thinking about college admissions. \n\nThanks in advance. Go Beavers!",

Beyond everything else, your academic performance and standardized test scores (think 95th percentile and above) are extremely important. It would probably be best to get in contact with the admissions office and, if possible, with Caltech alum to get additional perspective and application tips. Just know that they will probably only look at your essay after first looking at your test scores.",

            "comment": "1. It depends on your test scores, grades, and classes. Caltech looks for students with the very best test scores and grades who have taken the hardest classes available to them. You can get into Caltech without, say, calculus classes if they weren't available to to you, but you will have a harder time with the core curriculum. Doing STEM-related extracurricular activities also help. Some people will claim that you need to be a Physics Olympiad or Intel (now Regeneron) Science Fair winner to get into Caltech, but that is not true. I only did well at the local level in test-based science competitions, and I got into Caltech.\n\n2. I would probably go for the former, too, because it shows more passion in science/engineering. ",

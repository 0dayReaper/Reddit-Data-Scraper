How do you think it could benefit the students/campus?\nThese questions are open to current techers as well as alums. \n\nA few of us were thinking about spear heading a project to lay down some ground work for such a program, but it will only be worth while if the students actually want it. \n\nNot sure how large the audience is here, but it's a start.

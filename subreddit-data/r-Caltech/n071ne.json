    "postText": "On the Caltech website, it says: \n\n\"In general, most graduate students at Caltech receive full funding for their graduate education. In fact, all doctoral students have full financial support in the form of internal or external fellowships,  research assistantships, teaching assistantships, or some combination of fellowship and assistantship support. In most cases financial assistance is awarded on an annual basis, and is dependent upon  satisfactory academic progress. A separate application for requesting financial aid is not required.  On average, more than 98% of graduate students offered admission at Caltech are offered a package of merit-based financial support that pays all tuition charges and provides them with a stipend. \"\n\nI was curious what dictates giving more financial support (i.e. full tuition reimbursement and greater stipend) to one accepted applicant over another. I would think it would be which program your going in, GPA, amount and type of work experience, types of extra-curriculars, etc. but I'm only guessing. Any additional insight on this would be useful/interesting.\n\nAlso, what is the range that one could expect a stipend to be? (I know this may be difficult to answer generically, I'm just looking for a ballpark number).",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t know any Caltech specifics, but here are some causes of lack of funding for PhDs at peer institutions:\n\n- Master\u2019s vs. PhD. Both are graduate students but it\u2019s unusual to receive full tuition and stipend for a Master\u2019s. Caltech doesn\u2019t have large terminal Master\u2019s programs like some peer institutions, so the students in them could easily be the 2% without full funding.\n- International students cannot be covered under some types of federal grants, including IIRC NIH training grants. A department might admit an international student with a partial funding offer (say, RAship or TAship) if they really can\u2019t provide any better...but the matriculation odds will obviously be lower.\n- In engineering, some students join PhD programs with an intent to bail after the Master\u2019s. (If they joined a Master\u2019s program directly, they\u2019d have to pay for it, but PhDs usually receive a full ride + stipend.) Some schools have work requirements or retroactively-contingent funding policies to combat this...but I haven\u2019t heard of it at Caltech.\n- At peer institutions, humanities and social sciences tend to give funding through annual RAships and TAships that are not guaranteed to be renewed. Most science and engineering programs guarantee full funding, though the workload to ensure funding can vary drastically by program. For example, a math grad student might teach every singe quarter of their degree for funding purposes, while a biology grad student might teach a couple of times and have it framed as a learning experience, and an engineering student might peace out every summer for industry internships.\n\nIn short, at most institutions, GPA/research experience/extracurriculars/etc. actually aren\u2019t the major determinants of partial funding unless you\u2019re in HSS disciplines. A typical stipend for science and engineering students would be $35-40k but I can\u2019t speak to HSS.",

            "comment": "You get admitted to a department directly, typically only if two or more professors say they'd be willing to take and fund you. Getting admitted to a PhD program without a stipend is a soft rejection. Your competitiveness as an admit doesn't at all influence your stipend or tuition remission. The only things that might give you a boost is if you win an outside fellowship that pays your way. I'd guess the 2% who aren't offered tuition/stipend remission are those who won an outside fellowship after being rejected, notify the department of interest, and are then admitted contingent upon retaining their outside fellowship.\n\nActual stipends depend on your department's policies as well as the individual professor's stances towards ongoing raises. My department paid everyone the same first year, but left raises up to the individual adivsors. My lab didn't do raises, and I had to TA every year (almost every time a different class). It was pretty brutal. For historical data, I started in 2007 and was paid $26k/yr. It was also, I believe, the first year grad students had to start contributing to their health insurance premiums. :(\n\nAFAIK Caltech doesn't admit unfunded MS students. The whole time I was there I only knew one terminal MS student, and she wound up converting to a PhD and leaving her employer who had been paying her way.",

            "comment": "The nature of your graduate support would depend on the division you are applying/admitted to. The general Caltech stipend for 2021-2022 is $37,000. Some students are required to TA, some RA, some have the general institute fellowship. Some options/divisions cover you for the first year with the general fellowship and then you transition to a professor's grant. Etc.\n\nBut as the other poster mentions, Ph.D. students almost always get tuition paid + a stipend.",

    "postText": "I'm a first-year IB student from Singapore and recently got pretty much addicted to online courses on Coursera. There are a bunch of physics-related courses on Coursera that I've done over the lockdown. There's 'The Evolving Universe\" by Dr S. George Djorgovski, \"The Science of The Solar System\" by Dr Mike Brown. I've done a few others as well, like \"Particle Physics: An Introduction\" by University of Geneva and one on special relativity by Stanford. There's also a few by Princeton but they don't give certs so I don't think it counts.\n\nIdk what happened, I just downed coffee and finished all of these in like 5 days each.\n\nI was just wondering how much these would impact undergrad applications for an International Student. I initially did them for interest but am wondering how much weightage they would hold.",

You can review the transfer examination guidelines, an example test, and the expected knowledge of math and physics for transfer students here:\n\n[Examination Guidelines](https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/apply/transfer-applicants/entrance-examinations)\n\nYou may wish to note that Caltech typically only admits a handful or so of transfer students each year, usually no more than 2% or so the total applicants, so by percentage it is significantly less likely that one will be admitted as an undergraduate transfer compared to a qualified candidate applying as a traditional undergraduate or graduate student.",

The problem is most clubs at most places just don't do enough, for eg. there's a programming club, that organizes hackathons and stuff, but they just do it formally and just for the sake they have that club and get things on your resume and CV. \n\nI am more like a person who actually likes to do things rather than doing it for the resume or CV. (By the way, there's a new tradition of completing EDx courses and getting certificates and adding to your LinkedIn and CV), and I am not into these things, just getting a certificate and know nothing.\n\nEven I see some college applications for top colleges, some have competed in Olympiads and competitions that are really good, that's fine. But Why does being a club member or something even feel legitimate, even I had clubs in schools and college, they are just boring and are there just for the sake of it.\n\nWhat to do?",

So do a lot of other people (including Caltech students, alums, and admissions officers). \n\nFocus on learning a lot and doing STEM things which interest you. It is possible to make activities which are not competitions or clubs look good on an application. It just takes a bit more than the bare minimum of effort. \n\nRead the stickied post. This content is better suited for /r/applyingtocollege.",

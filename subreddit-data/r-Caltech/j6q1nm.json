With that being said, I would apply EA without SAT (the admissions director is literally the nicest lady and very understanding). They are not considering standardized tests this year, even if you take them. Here's an open letter to prospective applicants: https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/apply/first-year-freshman-applicants/holistic-review which I would definitely recommend reading. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions. :) Good luck!",

Because of this, and the types of schools that have EA, it's not generally easier to get in EA than regular and usually it's harder (people get deferred, etc). So if you think your SAT might help you, I would wait and apply regular decision",

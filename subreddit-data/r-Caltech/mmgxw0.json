    "postText": "Hey! I was recently accepted into Caltech and I had these questions. \n\n1. What kind of GPA would I need to get into a top MS/Ph.D. program after Caltech CS\u00a0undergraduate? How many people get this kind of GPA?\n\n2. What % of people who do Caltech CS as an undergraduate go to top MS/PhD programs?\n\nThank you in advance!",

            "comment": "Couple of different thoughts on this. Warning: Wall of text ahead. :)  \n\n1. GPA doesn't matter as much as showing that you can do the research and have good recs. Be aware that Caltech is a great school but it's also a *small* school with very its own style. For example, if you want to do things at the intersection of physics/bio/chem + CS, Caltech is pretty great. However, it's outright missing profs in some of the other big areas. (Caltech doesn't have any dedicated profs in natural language processing, for example.)\n   *  If you're gunning for a top CS PhD program, keep in mind that most successful applicants in the hotter, more competitive areas (ex. ML/CV/NLP) will already have 2 or 3 publications in top tier journals in the relevant areas by the time they apply. If you're thinking that you want to go for these areas, Caltech still might be good for you, but keep in mind that you might have to say, find a research opportunity at a different institution in order to explore an area/build the background/build connections. \n   * Put in another way: Being at a \"top\" school is good \"social proof\" for a lot of things, but it isn't everything for anything. Make sure you know what the \"everything\" for the things you care about are. (In this case, GPA is probably a smaller part of it than you think it is.)\n2. No idea off of the top of my head, but I wouldn't use that as your primary deciding factor. Caltech folks are weird and science-y. In my experience, the folks that end up in \"top\" places do so much more by the power of their own initiative than the average trends of the group.\n\n(There are also some confounding dynamics going on too. It used to be that physics and other hard sciences were the most popular major. However,  there's been a bit of a trend of \"folks realizing that hard science doesn't pay and that a lot of hard science folks end up in CS anyway\" which has meant that a lot more folks that would have otherwise declared another major now declare CS. This is dynamic is relatively unique to Caltech \u2014 after all, there's not that many other schools with as high % of folks that have the math/science/technical foundations to have the option of doing CS and be fine \u2014 so the % of people might not fully be an apples-to-apples comparison to other schools.) \n\nAs a sidenote here \u2014 in this day and age, going to a top CS program for a masters doesn't really mean that much. Specifically, a masters isn't really seen as anything fancy (compared to a well-done undergrad) by either industry or PhD admissions committees these days, especially since basically all the classes are offered to undergrads as well. If you miss out on a chance to do good research as an undergrad (which may be very relevant depending on your current background), doing a research masters can help boost things a bit. However, a master's is really not necessary at all these days anymore. \n\n(Additionally, since you pay to do a masters whereas they pay you for a PhD, the incentives are such that it's a lot easier to get into a master's anyhow.)\n\nOne thing I would also implore you to consider is what sort of life do you want *after* a PhD, given the subfield that you want to be in. It might be a little weird given how you're still a high schooler, but there are a few important things to note here:\n\n1. If you want to do a PhD to get a job working on research in CS in industry, don't. There are plenty of ways to get a role on a research-y team in industry without needing a PhD \u2014 you might have to tee up being at the right company (where \"most big tech company where it gets easier to change teams internally after you've built some clout\" can be considered \"right\" here) and actively being in a research role might not be immediate. However, seeing as the opportunity cost of doing a PhD rather than going into a decent big-co industry job is outright upwards of $1 million (seriously), unless you've got some other reason for doing a PhD, it's probably not worth it. \n\n2. If you want to go for a PhD for the academic track, start looking into what skills/experiences/etc you need to gain now in order to be successful and make a plan for doing this. I don't just mean technical skills, but also soft/process skills like \"time management\" and \"communicating effectively\" and \"knowing how to keep yourself from completely curling up in a ball for days on end when things don't work out (or at least, having a plan for teaching yourself how to curl up in a ball less)\". These get a little under-emphasized at Caltech (and by Caltechers) but they do tend to be skills that are multiplicative and PhDs are challenging enough where you might as well try to build everything you need early. In my experience, it's tended to be those that have figured out their focus, done so early, and built a plan that have tended to have most success. (And if you're not fully sure you want to commit to a PhD... the \"cushy industry job\" route is probably the better outcome :) )\n\nIf you're interested in seeing more random other musings about this topic, feel free to look at my comment history.\n\n(Also for folks who inevitably see this and figure out who I am.. I don't mind y'all knowing if I already know you in meat space, but please don't doxx me. :3)",

GPA is just one of the factors that comes into play when you're going into graduate school. If you want to go to grad school you will need to make sure you do \"well\" but other factors include the professors you do projects with, SURFs, letters of recommendations, any papers you may contribute to, etc. \n\nFinally, don't forget that Caltech is a top ranked school and that will help open lots of doors as long as your GPA doesn't stink.",

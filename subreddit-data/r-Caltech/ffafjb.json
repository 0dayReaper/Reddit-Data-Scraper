Does Caltech typically cover all of it? It would suck if I would not be able to attend just because of the cost...",

Caltech is very generous and will pay everything that the forms say you are unable to pay, but unless you show that you literally can\u2019t pay a single dollar you will have to pay a little bit. Caltech also offers loans and work-study (you work in the library or post office) to cover the gap. \n\nBtw if you have any more international student questions feel free to PM me!",

Because funds for international students are limited, Caltech has need-sensitive admissions for international students (i.e. it's harder to get in if you say you'll need aid), but once you get in, you're good.\n\nThis is also why international students *have* to mark on their applications that they intend to apply for financial aid (if you don't indicate it when you apply, you're not eligible to apply for financial aid in later years either). This way Caltech only admits as many international students as it can financially support and can commit to ensuring no admitted students fail to attend for financial reasons.",

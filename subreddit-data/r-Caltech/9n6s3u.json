    "postText": "The Caltech Archives are hosting an open house today, tomorrow, and Friday. You need to RSVP as per the email sent out to campus, but I wanted to recommend the visit. They've taken a bunch of historical artifacts and pictures out for a brief sampling of their collection. For example, you can read an original letter from James Watson written to Max Delbr\u00fcck regarding the discovery of base pairing and the structure of duplex DNA. At the end of the letter, James asks Max not to tell Linus Pauling about the letter or its contents before the DNA structure paper was accepted by *Nature*. ",

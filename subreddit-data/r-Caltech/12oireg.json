They can tell you if your application is at the standard that could be admitted, but iirc there\u2019s 2-3 admitted classes worth of people that are at that standard, and admissions builds the final admit pool from that. I\u2019d estimate conditioning on the preread being a yes bumps your chances up to maybe 30% from the ~5% overall admit rate, but it\u2019s definitely not guaranteed. Also, assuming the academic preread means that there\u2019s no essays involved, the yes/no from that isn\u2019t even that good of an indicator, since admissions seems to value essays/extracurriculares much more these days since stellar academics are the bare minimum to be considered.",

    "postText": "I'll be starting as a PhD student this fall and I plan to take my car to Pasadena. On the Caltech site's parking page, I see commuter and general parking listed interchangeably. I will be staying on campus. Can I apply for general parking, or is that only for commuters? I don't need a reserved space, which appears to cost twice as much ($160).\n\nIf I am required to get a reserved space, could anyone recommend cheaper rental parking spaces in the area?",

It\u2019s easy to overwork yourself and burn yourself out if you don\u2019t give yourself breaks.  I never took Ma 0 but I wish I had. Take Ma 0 when the time comes but other than that, spend the summer doing things you enjoy, there\u2019s a lot less time for that during the year!  Don\u2019t worry about special programs or research or anything unless it truly makes you happy and you\u2019ll enjoy it.  You\u2019ve done the hard work to get in. Take a little breather to get yourself ready for the challenges that lie ahead. Can\u2019t wait to see you on campus next year!!",

FSRI is a really fun five week research and math program. It also involves really cool excursions and it\u2019s a great way to get some research experience, learn the campus, and get to meet some of your new classmates!\n10/10 would recommend\ud83d\udc4d",

FSRI is an amazing program and as a Questbridge match you're likely the kind of student they're looking for to accept in the program (I say this as a match recipient who participated). You get to do some really interesting research and learn some cool math. Also, the people that run the program, the Caltech Center for Diversity, are some of the nicest people I know. And to top it all off it's free! 10/10 would participate again.",

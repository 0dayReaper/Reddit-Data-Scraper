    "postText": "Hey Caltech undergrads,\n\nCaltech Bikelab would like to get our announcements about events, classes, office hour info to undergrads -- we put fliers up near the dorms, libraries but its tough to actually get any kind of electronic announcement to the undergrads. We also post to Caltech Today but they don't really allow us to make announcements, just bare-bones calendar listings.\n\nBike Lab is pretty much grad students, we have no undergrads on our team (even though they are welcome to join us). Here's a question for undergrads -- I know from talking to you guys that there are class-specific Facebook groups, etc. but its hard for us to get our announcements to those. Is there an undergrad who would like to be our announcements liaison to the undergrad population at Caltech? and who would be in charge of getting our info about events/classes/office hours to them through your local undergrad email lists/Facebook groups?\n\nAlso, do you have any advice if you're a current undergrad at Caltech about how we can reach undergrads at Caltech better?\n\nIf you're not sure what Caltech Bike Lab is, we are a \"bike cooperative run by volunteers at Caltech, particularly students. We teach you how to fix/maintain your bike during weekly office hours, organize classes on how to ride safely in the streets, host rides and other club events, teach classes on bike repair, and participate in local Pasadena/Los Angeles bike community outreach to try to make the streets safer for everyone, not just cars.\"\n\nThis is our club website: http://caltechbikelab.blogspot.com/",

It's a lot more efficient for reaching interested students than house email lists. Also, ASCIT occasionally sends out emails promoting clubs, so you could try the ASCIT social director to get an announcement about bike lab, maybe with a link to a sign up for the email list posted to the undergrad email list.",

Otherwise you can try talking to the student government (ASCIT) about help with publicity.\n\nWhat you really want is probably some way to get e-mails sent to the house mailing lists. You could try contacting people (e.g., president) at the different houses about this.",

I've also tried to contact ASCIT but they're tough to get a hold of.\n\nPerhaps it is time I contacted the House Presidents for this, but it would be better if we actually got a undergraduate student involved with us :) more collaboration!",

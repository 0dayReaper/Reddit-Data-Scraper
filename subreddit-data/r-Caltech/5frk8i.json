    "postText": "I'm a Junior in computer science, and I'm planning on applying to Cal Tech's PhD program in the fall. I'm a part of a research program, and I will be doing research along side some established professors. \n\nThe GRE general test is required, but it is strongly recommended that individuals take a subject test as well. Being comp sci, the only subject test that really applies to me would be the math exam, but I've been told that this is a very difficult exam as about 30% of it is stuff that only a math major would have taken (real analysis, topology, ect.). \n\nWill my chances be severely hurt if I don't take a subject test, or is Cal Tech more concerned about my previous research?

            "comment": "If the subject test isn't required, I wouldn't take a subject that you aren't familiar with. \n\nParticularly if you have research experience, the subject tests tend to weighted pretty lightly. I have friends at Caltech who have scored in the 500 range, as well as friends with perfect scores. \n\nSubject tests tend to be weighted much less than, say, SAT scores. Professors are looking for talented and passionate researchers and they understand that subject tests are a relatively weak predictor of this, particularly if you have a strong personal story otherwise.",

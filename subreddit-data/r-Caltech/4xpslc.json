And now I need a place to live so I'm here looking for options if anyone has some. If anyone is in similar situation and need roommates to co-lease somewhere or suggestions on things in general please let me know. Thanks a lot!\n\nAlso, I don't know if there's any resources for incoming (grad) students to connect and meet potential roommates?",

Circuit construction, PC board assembly, EEPROM (re)-programming, lots of wire wrap and soldering, oscilloscope debugging and God help you if some random capacitor is wonky throwing off your whole board unless you touch it just so.\n\nAnd yes there's ALSO theory and desk work.",

Most of these are lab-style EE elective classes, but it is up to you to take those. Besides these, yes, the option requirements for EE are theory heavy.",

But beyond the basics of soldering and using hand tools and a meter, and of having hand-built a PC (which is largely assembling a box of parts that just plug into place), I didn't have any industry-relevant specific skills, either.\n\nBut I don't think that's really the issue.\n\nIf you go to Caltech, go for the education, not the job training.  I'm sure it's changed a bit over 25 years, but I expect they still include some basic skills (PH1 kits) and lab courses.  It really is easier to learn the practical stuff from friends and vendor-supplied material and online videos because it's easier to come across that information more than the theory and the meta-learning of how to tackle your problems.\n\nYou have four (ok, ~~five~~ six for me!) years where you get the luxury of spending dedicated time to learn the theory.  Once you're out, there's far less time available for that, unless you stay in academia/research.\n\n&gt;You can easily pick up the hands-on stuff by yourself\n\nI erred. I should have said:\n\n&gt;You can ***more*** easily pick up the hands-on stuff by yourself\n\nI stand by this revised statement.  I'd die on the hill defending that.",

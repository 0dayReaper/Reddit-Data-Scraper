            "comment": "Another applicant here. Many engineering colleges got 4x the avg applications so many dropped their acceptance rates by a lot. So many schools will be going to waitlists just because many students probably got into other university\u2019s and so everything will settle out (ie avg act and scoring should remain about avg). The current acceptances are skewed higher and so it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019ll be accepted off of a waitlist this year than some previous years. For reference UCLA was 18% and is now 5%, Northwestern was 13% and is now on the upper 3% range.",

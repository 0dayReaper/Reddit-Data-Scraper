    "postText": "Hi, my name is Josh.  I was a pageboy and graduated from Caltech in 2006 with a CS degree.  I'm launching Donut Labs to help Caltech students who want to start companies and broaden the possibilities for other students to learn about career opportunities outside of large companies.\n\nYou can read more here:  https://www.donutlabs.org\n\nI can answer questions here, but also if you're a student or alum who wants to learn more you can contact me at https://www.donutlabs.org/contact\n\nCaltech alumni have been responsible for many great companies. I've collected some of them at https://www.donutlabs.org/alumni-companies",

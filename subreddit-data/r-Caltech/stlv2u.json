It is a nice way to unwind and relax with friends, and I find it useful for unlocking some creativity. I graduated just fine, and now have a doctorate.",

My weed dealer there went on to create a super widely used open source software technology. I was at a startup not too long ago where we hired one of the biggest Techer stoners I knew for a ridiculous salary. He\u2019s still a super good programmer. I knew a kid with a 4.1 who got a masters and bachelors math physics. He smoked weed all day Sunday every week. Did a bunch of speed the rest of the week but you know.",

Possession of marijuana can carry a *minimum* of 20 years in prison^(1) or *mandatory life* if someone dies from the weed. People at Caltech respect the law, so no, you will not see it used while attending Caltech.\n\nThe first half of the question is unnecessary because obviously anyone who uses weed during high school will have a brain too damaged to get into a respectable institution like CalTech.\n\n^(1: Second offense of possessing at least 1000kg, or 1000 plants.)",

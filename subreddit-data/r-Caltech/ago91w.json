    "postText": "short: I will be working at Caltech for the summer and I need a place to stay that is (hopefully) within 1.5 miles of campus. I am open to any type of housing - a room or a full apartment/house. I am a student, so my budget is kind of sad. Dates are flexible, but will be at least 12 weeks from the end of May to August. let me know of any offers or other people to contact. thanks! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlong: hi, I am a junior at Harvey Mudd College and I will be working in a lab this summer at Caltech. I was there last summer as well, and finding short term housing was a real pain. I am okay walking a bit (last year I was about a mile and a half from campus) but if the place is far, I would prefer somewhere that is closer to old town. I am pretty flexible with dates right now, but I would prefer something that starts towards the end of May and goes to August. Budget is kind of small but please let me know of anything that is available. :) let me know of any offers or questions or other people to contact. thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(about me: I'd classify myself as a good roommate -- clean but not overly clean, cool but not too cool, etc. I am a female with she/her pronouns and I am open to any roommate who isn't an asshole. I am respectful to other people's property, I promise )",

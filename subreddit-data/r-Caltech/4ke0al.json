    "postText": "I'm about to start by PhD at Caltech would like to develop a longstanding interest I've had in dance. I'm interested in having fun (i.e. freestyle dancing) and working with pop/ rock/ alternative music-- not creating critically acclaimed art. \n\nAre there any such groups on campus? \n\nNote : I googled \"dance at Caltech\" but I can only find groups for which (1) members appear to have been involved with dance in some formal capacity prior to joining the Caltech group, or (2) a *specific* type of dance is practiced (salsa, swing, ballroom, etc..).",

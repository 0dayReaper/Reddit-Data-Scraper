    "postText": "Hi! I am a high school senior and Caltech has been my top choice school for a long time. I can foresee the \"Focus on getting in first\" comments, but I have already been accepted to the competitive Caltech Up Close fly in, which has historically been a strong predictor of acceptance to Caltech. Although I know that nothing is set in stone, I'm acting on the assumption that I'll be heading there next year. Since I got into the fly in, I've been thinking a lot about how life will be as a student there and what I can do to prepare myself for it. I have no delusions of being the \"best\" at a school with such outstanding talent, but I feel as though I am inadequately prepared to achieve my goal of a 3.7+ gpa there. I'm planning to major in mechanical engineering. I'm currently taking dual enrolled multivariable calculus, and will have finished all levels of AP Physics when I graduate, but I have never pursued competing in the AMC/AIME or USAPhO competitions, and having looked at a few math 1a problem sets, will likely suffer for it, as they are almost entirely proof based. This is why I am trying to start preparing as soon as possible. Is there a textbook I should look at? Is studying for AMC/Physics Olympiad a good use of time? What about emotional preparation? Any input much appreciated, thank you.",

There\u2019s also no way to be sure you\u2019ll be admitted to Caltech\u2014or even to say you\u2019re likely to get in. Going to Caltech up Close does not mean you\u2019re likely to get in. Caltech is a very, very hard school and the vast majority of students who go struggle a lot more than they think they will. I would not study as if you are assuming you\u2019ll get into Tech, as a result. \n\nThat said, my hardest class at Tech was Ma1a, so if you want to study for Caltech level classes, I would google the ma1a website and try to learn the material there. Outside of that, try studying the Ch1a and Ph1a materials to be ready for the early core classes at the school. You can find those materials through Google, mostly.",

Hopefully things do work out and I'm able to attend, either way I'm sure I'll benefit from learning from the website.",

            "comment": "Obligatory Caltech is hard to get into, you are likely to be rejected because statistics, I\u2019m so sorry that being a high-schooler is terrifying.\n\nCaltech makes an optional Summer course called Math 0 that is available to admitted prefrosh that provides some preparation for proof-based math. This is really the sort of thing you can concern yourself with if you get in. If you want to make your life easier when you get here, I would try and learn as much math as possible. Math 1abc, as well as math 2 (Diffy q) and 3 (probability and stats) can all be satisfied via placement tests, and most people who pass out are happy that they did. Even if your proof-based math is poor, if you know linear algebra and multi variable calculus well you can save yourself a lot of work by placing out of other courses. If you know your mechanics well, you can get out of Ph1a too. The rest you should probably take. \n\nIt\u2019s worthy of note that most of core won\u2019t hurt your GPA, since you would be on P/F for your first two terms. Even if you scrape by math 1a with a C, you\u2019re going to be okay. \n\nFinally, I\u2019ve found the introductory in-major courses to be much harder than core. Getting good at proofs is not going to save you. \nExamples: Bi8/9, Ph12b",

I hadn't considered trying to test out of math and physics 1a and I'll definitely look into it. Are most in-major courses graded on a curve? Can you comment on the relative rigor of specifically MechEng courses? Thanks again",

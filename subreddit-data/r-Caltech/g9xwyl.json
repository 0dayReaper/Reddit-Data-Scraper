            "comment": "In addition to interning at JPL, you need to ask what you are looking for in an aerospace program. If you are looking for hands on/industrial focused aerospace experience (like you may get at GT/MIT), Caltech may not be for you. All of the aero classes I have taken (Ae105 and majority of AE121) are pretty much 100% theory. The only AE classes I have heard that any hands on component is AE104 (aerospace experiments) and a minor project in AE221 (space structures). \nIn addition, (general complaint about MechE and AE), the career fair will be lacking at Caltech for you. Yes, JPL will be there, but Boeing for example hasn\u2019t been to our career fair since Fall 2018. People are still getting jobs with Boeing, but it\u2019s not the same level of connection as you would get at a career fair. \nIf you wanna know more, I can also answer more questions in PM",

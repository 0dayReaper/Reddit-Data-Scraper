Was a bit of a change after having great roommates all through undergrad.\n\nOther friends at Caltech had pretty cool roommates they stayed friends with for years.\n\nI'd go with 2 br apartments because it's only a few bucks more and you're less likely to run into issues having a loud roommate or one that keeps really weird hours.",

I did that for a year and then moved to the 2s and had a much better experience, but you have to find a good roommate.\n\nThe price difference between the 4s and 2s is minimal, but jumping up to the 1s is very expensive. They\u2019re also really hard to get.",

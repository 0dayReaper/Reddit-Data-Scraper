    "postText": "I am interested in pursuing a PhD in 2022 with Dr. Chung as my adviser. I am very passionate about Robotics and Control Systems with respect to space systems and it seems like this is in line with the work the Dr. Chung does. Has anyone worked with Dr. Chung before or been admitted in GALCIT? If so, I would like to know what channels you went through to apply and what your experience was. \n\nI am trying to network and find an adviser before I apply so I reached out to one of Dr. Chung\u2019s assistants, and they told me this:\n\n\u201cDue to Covid-19 and uncertain future for the labs, Professor Chung will not be able to accept students or visitors to his lab. We wish you good luck with your search and professional future endeavors. Thank you again for your time and consideration.\u201d\n\nI am not entirely in the loop over how Caltech is addressing Covid-19. Are all labs like his closed down? Also, are there any estimated dates for when they will open back up? If there is no chance for me to pursue a PhD with Dr. Chung in 2022, are there other similar labs that focus on robotics and space that are accepting candidates?",

I don\u2019t know about Dr. Chung\u2019s lab, but it\u2019s possible that covid has made it harder to get funding, which would explain the lab not taking new students.\nCaltech doesn\u2019t have a lot of roboticists, but due to the CDS department, those that are there do a lot of controls. Check out Dr. Joel Burdick and Dr. Aaron Ames in MCE, Dr. Richard Murray in CDS, and Dr. Sergio Pellegrino in GALCIT. Caltech is small, so many of them are cross-listed in other departments or have students from other departments. If you want to work on space systems, it\u2019s more important to find a space systems project than it is to be in GALCIT per se.",

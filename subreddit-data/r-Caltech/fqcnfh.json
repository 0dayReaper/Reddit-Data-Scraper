    "postText": "Hello! I was wondering whether Caltech is a good environment for pre-meds? Obviously the teaching and the research opportunities are amazing, but does the grade deflation make it insanely difficult to maintain good enough grades? And would you have to major in bio in order to feasibly complete the pre-med requirements? Do Caltech students get into top medical schools? What's Caltech's medical school acceptance rate?\n\n(p.s. I posted this on CC too so please don't answer twice!)",

            "comment": "Caltech is really really really really really really REALLY REALLY hard to do premed at. Most people recommend picking a different school if you want premed, it is SO HARD. It's not just the lack of grade inflation, but also the lack of grad inflation *at the hardest school in the country*. You need a really good reason for why it *has* to be Caltech if you want premed.",

            "comment": "Hello,\n\nMy girlfriend is currently a sophomore Bio major doing pre-med so I hope I can shed some light here. \n\nAs for your major, she says most tend to major in Bio or BioE.\n\nGrade deflation is definitely a challenge for maintaining a high GPA and she mentions it\u2019s probably the most difficult aspect of going to Caltech as premed, but certainly doable. The most challenging parts about this are the fact that the core at Caltech requires some quite advanced math/physics that other bio majors don\u2019t take at other schools. I see this as both a pro and con because although it may \u201churt\u201d your GPA, you still gain a valuable way of thinking that you may not see if you were simply confined to the classes in your major. (Also helps with MCAT)\n\nAs for lab work, she has had the privilege of working under a fantastic lab group that has been very open and helpful to getting her acclimated to the research experience. Getting a research spot at Caltech isn\u2019t hard, but striving to get that desired published paper is where the challenge comes in. To get into the top top med schools, it\u2019s very useful to have an academic paper. Making the most out of your research experience to get published is difficult and takes a lot of work. This is what makes it the most challenging at Caltech, because you still need to pay attention to your classes and can\u2019t put all your effort into lab.\n\nThat being said, Caltech is no short on the resources necessary to do this. If you\u2019re up for the challenge, being a premed at Caltech is very helpful as it provides all the necessary tools to get an academic paper published, while also offering courses that really challenge you and make you an all-around professional scientist. However, you really have to be up for the challenge because it isn\u2019t easy. \n\nPeople shit a lot on Bio as being the \u201ceasiest\u201d of the Pure sciences (among Chem, Physics, and Math). However, as a Physics major, the premed experience for Bio majors at Caltech is an insane amount of work that takes a really strong-willed person to get through, but the rewards you will reap from the effort will be amazing.\n\nIf you have any specific questions feel free to ask me and I can forward them to the missus.",

            "comment": "I graduated from caltech and have my MD. My sentiments echo what has been said already in the comments here. The reality of Med school admissions is that there are way too many applicants for a few spots meaning that they will not be able to evaluate every application holistically. If the cutoff to look at applications is 3.6 gpa or greater, unlikely for them to pull up your application to say oh this person has a 3.2 from Caltech\u2014that\u2019s probably more meaningful than a 3.7 at a state school. So yes GPA is going to be a tricky thing given that you\u2019re often going to be graded on a curve in the core in classes where there will be engineers, math, chemistry, physics majors who will play 80 hours a week of video games and still ace every class they take. \n\n That being said, I have plenty of friends who have completed been accepted and are completing Med school from tech. I also know people who were very intelligent but ended up having to apply multiple times before being accepted or going to less competitive programs than they probably would have if they\u2019d been a top student at a state school (which almost everyone at tech would be). What I\u2019ve seen is that tech students seem to be much more competitive in the md/phd applications than pure md as research is not really as heavily weighted in the md route. I would say if your goal is pure md think really hard about why you want to go somewhere that is going to train you to think like a scientist and if it is goin to help you accomplish your goals. As much as I loved it, I can\u2019t say caltech prepared me for Med school where most of what you\u2019re doing is memorization. I would say I struggled more than a lot of my Med school classmates on standardized testing because I hadn\u2019t trained in college for multiple choice tests and memorizing stuff. I think I may have taken a handful of courses that didn\u2019t have open book exams. Feel free to pm me if you have more questions.",

            "comment": "LOL i\u2019m gonna keep it a buck with you i\u2019m actually DYING tryna do pre med here. i\u2019m currently a soph bio pre-med and i can def confirm trying to just do pure MD is v v difficult. classes are v v rigorous and much more abstract/theoretical than what most pre meds experience at other schools. also, you basically have no time to do other EC\u2019s bc sets and lab take up your whole time. so not only could your gpa take a hit but also you\u2019ll rly not be able to do a lot of clinical/volunteer work compared to if you go to a UC or other \u201cacademically easier\u201d school.  i\u2019m honestly pretty concerned i\u2019m not doing enough but i also can\u2019t do anymore HAHA. if you\u2019re interested in MD/PHD however, caltech is actually probably one of the best places to go because of accessibility to research. wet lab research opportunities at caltech is definitely one of the best if not the best in terms of faculty mentorship, variety of fields, chance to do really hands on stuff (basically you can do anything). but again, your GPA may not be as good as at another school (but maybe you\u2019re a genius and you can do it). in terms of med acceptance out of caltech, i think the sample size for recent yrs might not necessarily be enough to rly tell how successful ppl are at getting into med school out of caltech. every yr it\u2019s like less than 10 ppl applying, but i will say i\u2019m slightly concerned. it\u2019s not like everyone is getting acceptances, every yr at least a couple ppl end up getting waitlisted everywhere. \u201cbeing pre-med\u201d is already VERY difficult at any school let alone literally one of the hardest schools in the world that\u2019s mostly research focused.",

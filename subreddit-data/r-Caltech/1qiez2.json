    "postText": "I got a co-op at JPL starting in January. I'll be avoiding Midwest winters (bittersweet there) and enjoying the California sun. I really want to get into hiking/kayaking/other fun outdoorsy stuff that seems more accessible in the area, but to meet people my age, I'd love to get involved with campus student groups. I'm assuming Caltech (like any school) has a variety of non-engineering-y student groups (board games, physical activity, w.e) and traditional hang-outs. Any suggestions?",

            "comment": "Actually, there are a ton of really active and great outdoor clubs on campus. The Alpine club, the ski/snowboard club, the Orienteering club, the gen'l Outdoor club known as the Da Vinci Club, and I'm sure more. Just start google searching and I'm sure you'll find stuff. I personally am a member of the Alpine club and have had a ton of positive experiences with them (climbed Mt. Whitney and North Palisade , both winter climbs). LA is a great place to experience the outdoors, rivaling Seattle or Boulder in terms of access to stuff. However the culture isn't as outdoorsy so you have to make an effort to find those things/groups; They won't fall on your doorstep like in those other places. With a 13 million population in the area, you'll find a sizable group of people for about any interest. \n\n[ALPINE CLUB](http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~alpine/wiki/Main_Page)\n\n[Da Vinci Club](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~outdoors/)",

Social life tends to revolve around which House (dorm) you live in, though that certainly isn't always the case. Your best bet for getting \"in\" would probably be to find a Techer working at JPL (or one seeing this post) inviting you to hang out on campus.\n\nHiking: I never got to see Eaton canyon, but a lot of people go there and it's pretty nice. Also definitely do the Hollywood sign hike. You get a pretty fantastic view of LA.",

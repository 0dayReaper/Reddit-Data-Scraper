    "postText": "Graduated in 1989 just when the ratio changed dramatically to around 2 to 1. There were some interesting side effects to having that many guys and that few girls.  \n\nIn Ruddock House, there was a tradition called \"1 yard line.\" You would yell that just as you jumped on someone who was sleeping on a couch in the common areas.  Another 10-15 guys would pile on top. That tradition died. \n\nRuddock had a number of magazine subscriptions, including Playboy.  The upperclass women all demanded that the subscription be cancelled or they would all move out.  The subscription was cancelled and 10 on-campus members got their own subscriptions.  \n\nOne prank that didn't work out was the Banners in the Rose Bowl Goalposts.  The plan was to have them unfurl during halftime.  A timer to turn on the radio-controlled airplane receiver would not work reliably, so a large number of batteries were used instead and the receiver set to an obscure frequency.  These were installed 3 weeks before the Rose Bowl when security was nonexistent.  Little did we know that there would be a radio-controlled airplane exhibition 1/2 a mile away from the stadium 2 weeks before the game.....sigh.  What did the banners read?  \"Hi, Mom! It's your son from Caltech!\" and \"Send more women!\"\n\nAMA about anything that happened around that time.",

Some people did have trouble with the Housing Office but it wasn't as bad as some of the other posts I've seen here.  \n\nYou pretty much had to have a house officer job to stay on campus if you were a Sophomore or a Junior with a bad card pick (Seniors with Aces picked first, Sophomores with Deuces picked last).  At least there were always places you could stay.  I'll never forget my acceptance package from Berkley which recommended I come out a month early to try to find a place to live.  Ummmm..... no, thanks.\n\nSorry, I don't understand the last question.  On the subject of grading, the UGs had to remind a teacher or 2 that UGs and Grad Turkeys needed to NOT be on the same curve.  Mostly because Grad Turkeys didn't always follow \"do not collaborate\" rules.",

I don't recall exactly what it was, but around 4 to 1 seems about right. \n\nAn example of what happens on a 7-1 campus.  A couple of girls from Occidental came by because they were bored.  They had hung out in the Ricketts courtyard for about 10 minutes before they were discovered.  They were given a tour of the campus (including the steam tunnels), invited back for parties, were guests at dinner, and had been chatted up by literally dozens of guys.  The consensus was that the talkative one was more fun but the quiet one was the most intriguing.\n\nAnything like that happen on your watch?",

The way they \"fixed\" it recently is that there is simply a high-level quota for intake of females, set at 50%, so all future classes will be 1/2 girls from now on. MIT has been doing that for a long time now, since the 1990's. Because of the quota, it turns out that the acceptance rate among guys is now 3-5%, whereas among girls, it's 25-30%.\n\nAnd stuff like that did sort of happen on my watch. When you'd go down to the coffeehouse, every social group there would be 1 girl, surrounded by 6 or 7 guys, all eagerly paying attention to them, and hanging on their every word.\n\nSome women really cultivated it, too. I saw a few girls become \"mothers\", and they would run the lives of a little family group of 5 or 6 guys; pretty weird!\n\nNot many outside girls came around; usually if they did, at least around Ricketts, with no delay, drinks loaded with Everclear would be handed to them, or super-extra-strength 'special' brownies, or something like that, if you catch my drift. On a couple of occasions, we went around to Occidental or even PCC, and that was *scary*: it seemed that every girl there had some *intense* looking cholo gangster boyfriend with a shaved head and prison gang tats clear across his chest and back.\n\nThis was also in the time of Margo Marshak, and a lot of student freedoms were *just* being phased out. All events had to be registered, professional bartenders were required, etc. I think that diluted a lot of the novelty that might have brought in some of the outside people.",

I took him on a tour around campus.  At one point, I said \"Hi, Rachael\" to a passing classmate.  After she passed, I told my friend \"There went the most attractive UG at Caltech, hands down.\"  He turned around, looked, then said \"That's it?\" and burst out laughing.\n\nSome of the girls at CIT liked being the big fish in a small pond.  One in particular did not like visiting her sister at Stanford where she was basically ignored by the guys there.\n\nThe other legend from our time was the \"Mrs.\" degree.

You might be accounting for the same thing, but: consider that even when it was 4:1 for me, once you discounted all of the girls that were too shy to ever go outside, too scared of the \"student life\" to participate in it, lesbians, or from a totally different cultural sphere (Chinese, usually), it was really actually more like 7 or 8 to 1. Did they have Avery in your day? That turned out to be an alternative dorm in which a fair number of girls (largely Asian and Indian) hid out, away from the ridiculousness of the rest of the houses.\n\nAs for the \"Mrs.\" degree, well, again, I understand that used to be much better when the whole college system was just \"different\", and Pasadena and the surrounding areas were full of \"finishing schools\" of various sorts.\n\nThe was it was in my day, though ... people hung on. I knew of several folks that met during orientation, spent 24/7 together for 4 years, and, got married right after they graduated. And if two people are dating when they graduate, it's sealed. They'll be living together, one will help the other get into grad school (if you're familiar with that game), and it'll result in a marriage. People know that you have to hook one as you leave.\n\nI've always said, \"The only thing I've ever wanted was a Caltech girl\", and people *laugh*, but they'll later come to realize that they want the same thing thing, and vica versa for the girls. Folks that I know that have gone off to grad school seem to overwhelming, maybe even in 100% of cases, will find a CIT student at that same school. And if they can't do that, they'll try and make something happen long distance. In fact, I even know of a girl that decided that she was going to drum a super long distance relationship with a Caltech guy, and is now in the process of switching schools to go and be with him.\n\nI can't even imagine what it'd be like now. The Facebook occasionally shows me undergrad girls saying that we have mutual friends through CIT, and I'm consistently astonished to see the volume and the type of girl (superficially, based on just the picture, I mean).",

We were the only white folks there! It was a gambling party with roulette, blackjack, etc. and you got 100 chips at the door.  At the end of the party, the hosts called out it was time for final bets.  The 3 of us forgot to bet everything and everyone else lost (00 on roulette, dealer got 21 on blackjack).  So the 3 howlies (Hawaiian term) won the 3 cash prizes.  Afterwards we all went to the South Houses downstairs lounge (sorry, name escapes me) to buy shakes and onion rings.  I excused myself after a bit and my friends kept talking.  2 years later I was a guest at their wedding.\n\nAs a Freshman, I had the opportunity to do a photo essay at a nearby ladies school, but I just didn't have the spare time to do it.  \n\nI ended up marrying an engineer (Photo-lithography tech), though I did consider a CIT girl I knew.\n\nAt the time, all houses ran their Interhouse party on the same night.

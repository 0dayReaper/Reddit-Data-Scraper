I think mostly because of the comparably tight space constraints on the campus.\n\nMost visitable thing would probably be the little museum in the Beckman Institute, which afaicr rotates somewhat but is mostly a museum of the life of Arnold Beckman (inventor of the pH meter, very wealthy Caltech scientist).",

You're right that they do have a good number of outreach events!",

Caltech was actually in discussions to develop one a few years ago, but it fell through for some reason. \n\nI think Cornell and Harvard also have Planetariums.

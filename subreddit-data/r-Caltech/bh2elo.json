Also, in which dorm will it be easiest to get 8 hours of sleep a night (if possible at all at Caltech)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who commented. I really appreciate the insight and I'll definitely keep an open mind during rotation! :)",

The houses generally have strong personalities, and if you don't mesh with the personality of the house you're in, it's fairly likely you'll be even more miserable at Tech than you otherwise would be (but a good personality-house fit  can make the social experience at Tech incredibly rewarding for you)",

There is slight variation in square footage and furniture, but that also varies a lot within the houses as well. Volume also varies by where your room is, so it is difficult (if not impossible) to make blanket statements like that.\n\nAlso, presuming that you are a prefrosh, this is really not something you need to be worrying about now",

Also, barring a few singles, Bechtel will largely force you to share a suite with other people, so there are few guarantees about cleanliness there.\n\nit's also pretty reasonable to warn the prefrosh to keep an eye out for things that may matter more in the end than quiet and a clean space, since they ask the question phrased in a way that suggests they're using it as a metric for house selection; pointing out that house selection is more than just picking a living space is pretty important.",

I just kinda feel like some people really value their sleep and I would entirely suggest that a person like that go through rotation, live in Bechtel, and then be in whatever house they want to. I don't think it's in any way unfair to tell people the best suggestion given their personal preferences.",

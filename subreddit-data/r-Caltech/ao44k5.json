    "postText": "How many legitimate clubs with a decent size and purpose are there here at Caltech? I feel like almost every club I've tried out is either run by one extended friend group or only has &lt;10 people, and they all share the general trait of being run in a very informal, but borderline unprofessional, manner.... that is if they don't disband after a year or two.\n\nI've heard the other institute of technology has Traders, Sloan Business Club, Splash, HMMT, a consulting group, etc. I hate to be making comparisons all the time, but is there anything of that flavor here? I'd love to know. Thanks",

            "comment": "Some Caltech clubs have been around a long time and have a history of non-affiliated members (or staff, JPL employees, postdocs, and alumni) contributing to club organization and administration, and sometimes keeping the club alive. Often, the outside people or non-student affiliates outnumbered student members. At the same time, other clubs are formed around a group of friends with a common interest and have trouble growing and continuing. Caltech students don't tend to be very involved in extracurriculars outside their houses.\n\nIn recent years, administration has made official rules about what counts as a student club that can officially make reservations for common space. Because of the added rules and requirements, I think the number of clubs has fallen even more, and the clubs that depended on outside membership are having a harder time.\n\nCaltech has an active entrepreneurship club that holds events regularly. A consulting club and a student investment club exist, but I am not sure if they are still active. The Shotokan Karate Club has been around a long time and is well regarded. Tai chi has been around a long time, and so have some of the dance clubs. The Caltech C, the Chinese students association, has been around since the 1940's and is one of the largest and more professionally run clubs because of the large number of Chinese students. (They're mostly from China, not Chinese-American.)\n\n",

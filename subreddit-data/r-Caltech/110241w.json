By then you were long gone or else i would have chased you down had you dropped it off at a more reasonable time for your booking ending at 3:30. \n\nThank you for ruining my plans lol literally was going to Long Beach! I'm not paying out my ass for a round trip Uber.",

I just get there early. I unlocked the car at 3:15 (I set up a dash cam each time) and there was no key in the car, because the key had been cut from the wire attaching it to the car. It was nowhere in the car. The person before me had dropped off the car way early but took the key with them, so I didn't even have the option to follow after them and let them know. Did you not even read the title?",

If you\u2019re not going to be living there as a couple then your odds of winning the lottery are very bad.\n\n2. They\u2019re quite small. The bedroom is an odd triangular shape that is very inefficient. A double bed for a couple can be very very tight. The living room is decent. The bathroom (like everything) is small, but is great for its size. The kitchen is okay.\n\n3. I think on-campus is UG only and Cats is Grad only, so I\u2019m not sure that you\u2019ll get the choice between the two.",

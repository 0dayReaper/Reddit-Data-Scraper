    "postText": "Greetings!  I am a second year PhD student in Space Sciences at Florida Tech, and I received a 10 week internship at JPL for the summer.  I have the option of staying on campus during this time.  It looks like there is a shuttle that runs from Caltech to JPL and back throughout the day?  The only information I could find on this is from 2011, so I am worried about it being out of date.  I'm trying to ensure that I could survive living near Caltech without a vehicle for the ten weeks, relying on this shuttle and other public transportation (in addition to a bicycle) to survive during the summer.\n\nDoes anyone here have any information or advice for me?  Many thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "The shuttle you are referring to that runs throughout the day is not for daily commuting between Caltech / JPL.  You likely will be recognized if you take it every day and not be allowed to continue.\n\nDuring the summer there is a Caltech / JPL bus in the morning / evening for undergraduate students participating in the SURF program, who live on the Caltech campus but work at JPL.  I'm not sure if you can take this bus if you are unaffiliated with SURF.  Since you're offered the option of staying on the Caltech campus, it's possible you may be allowed.  I would contact your program about it; if not allowed by default, maybe they can arrange permission for you.\n\nWhile less convenient, there are also local bus routes that go between Pasadena and the JPL area.  You can check these out using Google Maps' public transportation option.",

    "postText": " I'm looking to rent out my fully furnished room in a 2 bed, 2 bath apartment in Pasadena, CA to a woman for 6 months mid-June to mid-Dec (dates negotiable) while I'm on rotation. Rent is $1,125/mth, and with utilities/internet it's roughly $1,200/mth. Room is 14 ft x 10.5 ft, with a built in closet. There's a spacious living room, large porch, laundry in the building, a parking spot, an elevator, and built in AC/heating. We're a 7 mins walk from Fillmore Station (the Gold Line metro) and CVS and a 5 mins walk from Trader Joes.\n\nYour housemate would be an early twenties MIT alumna who is neat and quiet. The apartment is basically at the intersection of Marengo and California Blvd.\n\nMessage me if you're interested and please share with people who you think may be interested!",

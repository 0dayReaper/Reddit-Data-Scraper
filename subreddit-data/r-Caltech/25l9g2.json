    "postText": "So as a soon-to-be frosh at Caltech, I was wondering what I should look for when I'm buying a laptop. I want to major in electrical engineering, but I don't know what programs/software I need and what kind of laptop would be best for EE, and I don't really know a whole lot about computers (which isn't too great considering my desired major, haha). I want to get the laptop during the summer, so I'm not planning on buying it at the Caltech store either.\n\nShould I get a Mac or a PC? What should I try to get for the processor / hard drive / RAM / other specs? And so on. (Also, as a side question, should I buy Microsoft Office, Adobe software, etc.?)\n\nFor context, I'm probably gonna be using the laptop mostly for school, and I live in Canada, if that has any effect on the availability of laptops.\n\nThanks! :D",

    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nSo, my question is, where do you guys go shopping for supplies and groceries without breaking the bank? It seems to me that Trader Joes, Whole Foods etc are quite expensive. \n\nI live very near the campus so please give me some recommendations around that area!\n\nThanks in advance!",

If mobility is important to you (say, mobility that lets you get boba at Sab Gabriel with friends on a random weekend) I would arrange to have your car with you at the earliest possible opportunity.",

Back in the 90s, finding parking was an issue because you had to get an assigned spot and there weren't that many.  Not sure if that's changed in the decades (ugh I'm old) since then.",

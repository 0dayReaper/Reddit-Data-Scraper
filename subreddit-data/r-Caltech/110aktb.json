Is it common for undergrads to do paid research during semesters, and if so, what are the approximate rates?",

            "comment": "It's decently common for people to extend summer research projects into the year, or to get a head start on some of the lab work for an upcoming summer project. I think people more commonly choose the paid option over academic credit. For reference, the SURF program pays a stipend that works out to ~$15/h and TA jobs (that undergrads can get) usually pay in the $25-30 range. I'd guess research positions pay somewhere between those two rates.",

I applied to 8 other universities, but Caltech responded quick. I am getting $7100 plus \u2248$2000 for housing. June 21-Aug 25. Many people do these programs an they are selective. Or you could just extend your project at your own university. I do research rn and I\u2019m in another program at my university where they pay me \u22481000 a month and 50% of my tuition. Last year I extended my project into the summer.",

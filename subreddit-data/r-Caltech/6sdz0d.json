At the same time, there's an obvious downside- it'll be harder to find people with similar interests.\n\nBesides, there's the obvious fact that just finding the time for anything other than school at Caltech seems near-impossible.\n\nThouhts?",

If your activity isn't featured, it's very easy to start your own club and get some money for activities. \n\nAs far as CSGO and DnD, I guarantee there are dozens of people into them. They may meet informally as \"friend groups\" instead of registering to be a club.\n\nYou will find time for fun. Usually on Friday nights and Saturday nights enough people take time off to have group activities. ",

As for computer games...well, I had friends who had to drop out due to their DotA addiction, so maybe not the best example to follow, but moderation is probably possible.\n\nNone of that was through clubs, though, it was just something people did with their friends. I never got very involved in clubs myself, but there are a bunch if that's your sort of thing.",

Sometimes people really don't like the house system and then it kinda sucks, but otherwise it's like 20-50 insta-friends. There's clubs for Super Smash Melee, LoL, etc., and many houses have a house collection of board games. Often 1-2 houses even have board game night as a rotation or PFW activity.",

I worked at Ucla so I have an idea of what you\u2019re describing. \nHow competitive is it to land a job there? I\u2019ve applied to their generalists position but I think I was over qualified. What kind of people do they generally look for? And what do they value most in candidates? \nAnd what about pay? Are they fair?",

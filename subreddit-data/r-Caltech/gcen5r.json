    "postText": "Does anyone have advice as to whether we should bring a desktop? For a major like electrical engineering is it useful for heavy projects or would it just be redundant? Do y'all spend enough time working in your dorm rooms to justify bringing one? Alternatively, are video game parties or group game hangouts common where a good pc could be leveraged? Thanks y'all :)",

I leave mine there during the summer as well since there's a free plug and ethernet line in the lab I work in, so it just becomes a remote server (Also more secure than the storage you get in your house). If you're not local or driving in to move you might want to build one there since the Newegg distribution center is also in LA (essentially one day shipping) and bringing a desktop on a plane sounds not so fun.",

If you are going to end up going back and forth a lot between home and Caltech, I recommend having two desktops if possible, and share a graphics card between them (since it's the most expensive part) that you carry with you when you go home and stuff.",

If you have to pick one, I'd say go for laptop, you're much more likely to want a computer with you in a lounge/dining room/etc for working on sets than anything else. Also, if you've never built your own desktop before, you'll be able to get a much nicer pc for a lot cheaper with people helping you on campus.\n\nNot having a desktop also incentivizes not gaming which can save your grades lol (otoh I spent all my time gaming and now work in esports so YMMV)\n\nMy advice would be bring laptop, don't bother desktop, can build/bring desktop later on if you end up needing it.\n\nAlso, don't plan *too* specifically since who knows if you will even be on campus this year due to COVID.",

Bechtel has much smaller desks which will probably only fit one monitor and mid tower, or two monitors if you squeeze.\n\nEdit: alb is right a lot of the south campus houses give small desks now, will depend on the room you get. Surplus store is an excellent place to get a cheap used desk!",

Bechtel desks are very small and if you have a laptop or monitor kb dont even think of doing work on it - nothing will fit. If you find the desk size restricting, you can probably get a tanker desk from the central warehouse campus surplus for $30 to $40, but you'll have to haul it back to your room (gl w that tanker desks weigh 300 pounds or more)",

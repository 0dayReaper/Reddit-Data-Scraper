I don't necessarily like it here (albeit a lot of that is stemming from external family and health issues), but I know people who are absolutely loving their time on campus. That being said, I honestly don't think you can generalize life here to any set of specific characteristics, so I'd say it's most important to be able to find people you like being with and stick to a field you're interested in. Definitely worth getting multiple perspectives though \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

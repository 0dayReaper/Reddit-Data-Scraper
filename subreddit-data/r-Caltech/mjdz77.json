    "postText": " \n\nSo I got into my dream school-- and was rejected from every other school, including some master's programs (5 in total). My GPA is mediocre-- 3.5, but I went to a fairly competitive private liberal arts college for undergrad. My confidence as a student is low, but if there's one thing I do, I plan way out in advance.\n\nI looked up a house in my hometown (Anaheim, CA), and they go for 700K+. So I need a six-figure salary by the time I'm 30. And that wouldn't happen with just a biochemistry undergraduate degree. So I bought a book, I begged undergraduate professors for their help, I applied to fellowships, etc. Now I'm hoping to make the right connections in graduate school to launch myself back to a place where I can afford the place I was born.\n\nAny and all advice is welcome. I know I only have this one shot, so I'm not afraid to be humbled if that's what it takes to find my way back home.\n\n**TL/DR:**\n\nGoals: Successful Ph.D. stint, networking, successful career path in industry.\n\nObstacles: clinical depression, 5+ years, we've met the economy.",

I know that pre-COVID some fresh Caltech PhD grads were getting finance offers in the $250k-$400k range, but you have to move to NYC or Chicago (or maybe SF) for those opportunities. However, those jobs are extremely competitive.\n\nI know those jobs aren\u2019t in your hometown but if you save up $250k after-tax over 2-3 years then you can return, find a new job, and buy a house.",

That being said, you can do yourself a big favor by picking a lab with a mentor who is amenable to your desire to go into industry and could potentially help you get out in around 5 years. There are quite a few groups on campus that help with networking outside of academia (biotech club, entrepreneurship club, etc) and the division also occasionally hosts non-academic job panels and the like. You might also consider doing an industry internship over a summer sometime in the middle of your PhD, but if that\u2019s something you seriously want to do, I would again stress that you should find an advisor who would be ok with a break like that",

More internships sound daunting but would be worth it for the right company.. it\u2019s good to hear that CalTech has some programming to help students find their place in industry should they desire it.",

A couple years ago, starting salaries at these companies for fresh Ph.D. graduates were $165K base + ~$40K signing bonus + ~$40K bonus. I know of multiple students who majored in chemistry or biology who ended up working for these companies as B.S. or Ph.D. graduates, so I'm sure they'd be a realistic option for you as well.",

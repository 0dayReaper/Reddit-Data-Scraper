What the hell am I supposed to do here?\n\nI'm an overall boring, quiet and quite uninteresting person. I don't do much socializing and spend most of the time reading, playing music and studying. I'm not a quirky person, but I do believe I'm not anti-social, just a bit recluse. And I understand that the whole purpose of the question is to show you're not \"all work, no play\", and I'm not, but I just don't do anything but boring stuff to pass time.\n\nThis thing is killing me. I can't for the life of me even imagine what I could put here that wouldn't sound trite or fake, and I'm not funny enough to make up something here. Do you guys have any indication of what to write here?",

            "comment": "I'm fairly old so take this with a grain of salt, but my first response was \"prank culture? are they still trying to sell that shit? lol\"\n\nI mean, occasionally there are a couple of students who really get into it, and when they do things that are legal and charming, that's great for PR, so I understand that the school totally wants to cash in on it, but I think our prank culture is pretty overstated. \n\nDon't feel obligated to have that persona. Lots of people don't and they do just fine.\n\nA better way to think about that question might be, what do you do that is creative? I don't mean that in the narrow artistic sense - what are you playing with? What are you trying to build, whether it's tangible or theoretical? What have you worked on outside of school that made you think \"hey, this is neat\"? \n\nYou say that you only do boring things, but what if that's an unfair judgment on yourself, borne out of a culture that prizes extroversion and projection? If you can't step back from that, are there people who can give you a fresh perspective on what's interesting about yourself?",

The \"prank culture\" is something Admissions likes to tout, but that the Institute will fuck you up for pursuing unless you get everything approved by half a dozen administrators. One prank I was involved in required about 20 hours of meetings with various people and was a massive undertaking to get approved.\n\nAs for how to answer the question - if you can't describe something with genuine interest, you should probably reconsider coming here. I don't like phrasing it as \"what are you passionate about\" because I and others didn't know that coming into Tech, but some sort of interest is vital.",

I talked about my passion for meming and how I specifically learned photoshop to create memes about my friends and have fun with them. There must be SOMETHING that satisfies your soul. If you say you aren't anti-social, think about how you communicate with people, how do you appeal or flirt with people to like you, then develop on that idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd remember, there's no rule of 100% honesty- You need to just sound believable. :)",

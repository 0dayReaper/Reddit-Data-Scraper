            "comment": "Averages out to meh; Caltech dining services (CDS) runs all on-campus cafeterias and kitchens (Browne Dining Hall, Red Door Cafe, Broad Cafe, and open kitchens in student houses) and, as such, does not always care about quality of the food. I\u2019ve been told (mainly by CDS employees) that food used to be better before COVID, but as of now the options feel limited. \n\nFor reference, Browne Dining Hall serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and has various food options including sushi, salad, pizza, grill, Mongolian grill, etc. Red Door Cafe and Broad Cafe have more limited options, both serving sandwiches and salads (with the exception of soup at Broad), and Broad has limited hours (7am to 2:30pm) while Red Door has the longest hours out of all the options (7am to 2am). The house kitchens are open most of the day to quickly grab cereal, bagels or snacks and are open during dinner hours for house dinner (dinner is a weekly cycling menu with the same food being served at Browne).\n\nHope that helps, but more info here if necessary: https://dining.caltech.edu",

As for red door, it just feels\u2026 repetitive and overall meh to me, as you said",

            "comment": "I went to Caltech before covid and during Caltech I thought the food was okay but then after I graduated I realized it was amazing (this often happens in life).\n\nBrowne Dining Hall is open basically the entire day (7am -10:30am for breakfast, 11am - 3:30pm for lunch, 5pm-7:30pm for dinner). When I was there it was open 5pm-8pm for dinner, and before I was there it wasn't even open for dinner.\n\nThe menu isn't massive but it's all you need. I was just reading the menu right now and miss it so much (idk why people say it's worse after covid it's literally the same lol). You got so many sandwich options you can rotate between at the grill. They also have a middle station with food you can self serve if you're in a rush. They have specials that they change every week. On top of all that they have a mongolian noodle grill, sushi, and pizza. Like wtf this is so much food. AND you can make it healthy! They always have so many great veggies you can chow down on, and you can get the chicken sandwich (my go to for healthy).\n\nAfter you're done scarfing down at Browne you can go to red door and get any drink you want. Latte, green tea, mocha, etc. you can even get a pretty solid pastry to go with it.\n\nThen you and your friends can go work on a set in the sun in beautiful Caltech.\n\nOh god I miss caltech so much now. Cherish the food man. Cooking for yourself or eating chipotle everyday sucks (way worse in cold, dark, loud new york).",

I'm really surprised that you cook for yourself instead of eating CDS (unless it's for monetary reasons). \n\nMaybe I can take your tips and stop eating like shit post grad (cry emoji)",

Usually, this takes an hour or two, longer for more complicated food. Sometimes I will also made side dishes, bake bread, or make desserts. I run a dessert club at Caltech, so I bake with them every two weeks.\n\nDuring the week, I eat a mix of the prepared meal, and standard stuff that's easier to prepare or mostly prepackaged like noodles, sesame porridge, simple stir frys. I try to buy fresh fruits and vegetables whenever possible. Canned ingredients are also cheap and convenient to use while still working in high-quality dishes.\n\nTrying to cook a \"reasonably nice\" thing every day is going to take a lot of time, no wonder why you're tired. Invest maybe four hours a week to prepare two more complicated \"nice\" dishes that you like, and a few side ones, and stock up on ingredients for easy-to-prepare meals. Finding recipes you enjoy and that aren't too difficult or expensive is half the battle. I'm not remarkably skilled or experienced at cooking, I just find recipes online and follow them.",

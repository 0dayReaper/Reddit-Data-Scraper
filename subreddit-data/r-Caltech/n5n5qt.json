    "postText": "[Caltech's Summer Plans and Undergraduates' Return to Campus Approved](https://together.caltech.edu/updates/general/05052021) \n\nWe are thrilled to share that the Pasadena Public Health Department has approved our summer plans. Further, the city has indicated the Institute can proceed with plans to reopen campus residences and classrooms this fall to fully vaccinated undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nBeginning June 14, Caltech will house up to 385 fully vaccinated undergraduate students participating in on-campus research, learning, and training activities, with priority for individuals participating in the [Summer Undergraduate Research Fellows (SURF)](http://sfp.caltech.edu/programs/surf) program, the [WAVE Fellows](https://sfp.caltech.edu/programs/wavefellows) program, and the [Freshman Summer Research Institute (FSRI)](https://diversity.caltech.edu/fsri), as well as pre-season student-athletes who traditionally arrive before the start of the fall term for training exercises and competition. Undergraduates enrolled in two engineering lab courses\u2014EE85: Analog and RF Circuits Laboratory and ME13/113: Mechanical Prototyping\u2014that are being offered this summer, after having been canceled due to the pandemic restrictions earlier in the year, also will be able to live on campus. Students eligible for campus housing as part of any of these activities should contact the [Housing Office](mailto:housing@caltech.edu) directly to arrange their summer residency.\n\nRead the full memo (linked at top of post) and become familiar with important related policies including the student vaccination policy posted to [Together.Caltech.edu](https://Together.Caltech.edu).",

Given that CA is on track for a full reopening by June 15th it would only be prudent that mandatory telework restrictions be eased at JPL too by summer. Will JPL fellows who need to go on lab be considered for housing priority?",

Permission is granted on an as-needed basis, and last I heard it won't relax until August.\n\nJPL set most of its employees to be working 100% remote well before the state's lockdowns occurred, so it shouldn't be a surprise they'll also be opening up a bit later.",

All of the IT stuff is set up for that, too.\n\nIf you're ever in the area in the future, though, I'm sure whoever your mentor is would be willing to give you and anyone with you a private tour of the lab.",

As you can see, the information on the linked page was last updated on April 12 and constitutes the latest information for JPL.",

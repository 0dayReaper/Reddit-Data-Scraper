    "postText": "The full update is posted here: [https://coronavirus.caltech.edu/updates/general/81320](https://coronavirus.caltech.edu/updates/general/81320)\n\nKey points:\n\n* New protocols released by LA County preclude in-person instruction and on-campus dormitory living, which necessitates the decision to go fully remote for our undergraduate program in fall 2020.\n* We do not believe that those protocols have direct implications for graduate students who live in apartment settings and engage in laboratory research regulated by other workplace protocols.\n* In light of the ongoing public health risks to our community, we discourage undergraduate students from moving to Pasadena in order to live near campus.\n* The Undergraduate Deans' Office and Office of Residential Experience will establish virtual living/learning groups for first-year students, with regular interactions and engagements with an assigned faculty advisor and undergraduate peer and graduate mentors.\n* Anyone who comes to campus must adhere to Institute guidelines that mandate personal health monitoring and reporting, physical distancing, and the use of cloth face coverings.",

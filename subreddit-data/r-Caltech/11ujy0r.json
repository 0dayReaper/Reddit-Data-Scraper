    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI've been working for most of my 20s and 30s with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and have been continually using a poor excuse to just delay grad school.  \"Let's work another year and grow my school fund a little more\" kind of mindset/excuse.  This went on for about 7 years...\n\nMy company recently furloughed all of its staff (can you guess which company that is?) so that poor excuse is suddenly gone!\n\nTerrible situation aside, I'm now HIGHLY considering taking this opportunity to pursue a PhD in Planetary Geology.  Always loved geology and found out (while working) that I truly enjoy being an SME of a very niche subject.\n\nMy current plan is to get a second bachelors in Geology while building up my research experience, then apply to the Caltech PhD program.\n\nAm I crazy?  Many people are telling me to just get an M.S. in Geology, but I believe I'd need to take 2-3 years of undergrad core Geology courses.  Not even including the pre-reqs I'd probably need to re-take since it's been over a decade.  I...forgot a lot...\n\n(apologies if this is too much of an admissions question, but I wanted input from people with direct experience with this)",

This will expose you to a lot of research opportunities and you can probably work with Caltech faculty before deciding on going for a PhD.  I think that would serve you better than going for another bachelor degree.\n\nDepending on where you are, the Lunar and Planetary Lab at University of Arizona, LASP at CU/Boulder, or the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab are options too.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Definitely a little crazy. What do you want to do with a PhD in planetary geology? With a masters in geophysics you can work in industry and do quite well, unless of course you want to be a professor or something. Definitely do not need a bachelors degree for geology. I think that would be pretty pointless tbh.\n\n With the ME degree you really won't have too many math prerequisite courses to take; geology itself is pretty qualitative and can be wrapped up in 2-4 classes, which leaves a handful of geophysics courses that are math heavy. Also, the field is becoming more and more comp sci heavy so you will need to develop these skills which is arguably more important than learning \"geology\". I love geology and i think it is a great hobby, but you can totally explore that without a degree and lean into merging your math/eng background with computer science and geophysics.",

I know I know, low chances, but it's been fun trying.  But this is why I'm pursing a PhD in some hard science.  Trying to be what you might call a \"triple threat\" in the musical theater industry.   \n But in this case, applied science, hard science (which I'm missing), and physical aptitude.\n\nThat's good advice on comp sci and will definitely look into geoscience!",

    "postText": "I cannot seem to figure out taxes here. I got a \"memo\" in the mail telling me I made some amount over the past year (I guess for my first quarter, since that's the only part applicable to the 2022 tax year), but as far as I can tell the US Government has no idea how much I made since it isn't a W-2 or similar tax form. Is that correct? Obviously I am below the tax threshold this year, but can I simply not file taxes while I am here? I get that the thing we are \"supposed\" to do is report this as other income, but I can't tell whether the government actually has any idea what we've made and whether or not I can get away with not filing anything. Any insights from anyone in year 2 or above?",

Stipends explicitly DO count as income. You can roll the dice and not file - plenty of folks in my cohort in grad school did and got away with it - but if you are ever audited the IRS can hit you hard for back taxes and fines.",

Instead, we\u2019re left to our own devices. \n\nSince you\u2019re a citizen, for future, maybe poke around on access.caltech and file a W4 to initiate withholding. You can download your electronic W2 there too, as well as manage tax-advantaged retirement contributions.",

I don't know why you think you can simply \"not file taxes while you're here\" -- grad students do, in general, pay taxes just like anyone else. You will certainly need to do both federal and state taxes in future years, when you have a whole year's worth of pay.\n\nFor 2022 (assuming that you're under 65, are filing singly, and have no dependents), you have to file federal taxes if you made over $12950 total. You have to file California taxes if you made over $20913 gross income. The fact that you were in California for less than 183 days isn't relevant, because you're not here temporarily (you're staying and continuing to work in 2023).\n\nIt's possible that your parents are still planning to claim you as a dependent. They are only allowed to do this if you were still 24 years old, at the end of December 2022. If you were 24 or younger at that point, then you should check with them about whether they should claim you as a dependent or not. If you're a dependent, you shouldn't have to file taxes.\n\nEven if you're not a dependent and you don't have to file because your income was low, you might still *want* to file taxes, because you'll probably get money back (in form of Earned-Income Tax Credit). This is typically in the range of several hundred dollars.",

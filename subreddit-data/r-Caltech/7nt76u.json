            "comment": "I hate these fake deep questions. It's on the same level as \"what's your biggest weakness.\" I'm sorry you got this question OP. You're most likely 17 years old with a likely preference for science and math and it's ridiculous to expect you to know (or explain well) how Caltech will help you meet your goals  or why it's better than another choice. The top few STEM schools should be pretty much substitute goods for you aside from location.\n\nFor me personally, Caltech was a fairly difficult grind. I barely graduated on time and at least one professor gave me a pity pass my senior year (I still have no idea how functional analysis works). However, the main takeaways I got from Caltech that I think I wouldn't have gotten elsewhere are:\n\n* **strong work habits** \\-\nI was a terrible student before Caltech, because I could get away with it. There is no \"easy\" way through Tech, jokes about MechEasy to the contrary. You are forced to learn to focus and spend large amounts of effort.\n* **humility** \\- I used to be ridiculously cocky and arrogant. Because of the small class size, you will have constant interactions with people I'll call \"real geniuses.\" You don't encounter people like that much after graduation, but knowing that they exist has led me to be a lot more humble, as well as spur me to work harder. Now I'm just confident.\n* **familiarity with research** \\- You are pretty much expected to do research at Caltech. People in the outside world tend to blackbox research unless they have a PhD, but even Caltech graduates without a doctorate are comfortable reading and analyzing a research paper.\n\nThere's a bunch of other things as well, but I suspect they're all things you should be able to gain at many schools.

After undergrad I got that humility in check. I am also doing research right now. I was interested in Caltech for grad b/c of the strong research culture. Plus I read a paper or two from a Caltech faculty, and I'm like wow this college is amazing. Only problem is that - my undergrad GPA tanked crazily. I do have prior undergrad research experience. ",

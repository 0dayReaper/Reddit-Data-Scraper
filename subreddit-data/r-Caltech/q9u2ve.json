            "comment": "As the saying goes, the odds are good, but the goods are odd. People are generally willing to date (presuming you have a real connection and don\u2019t go at it like a pickup artist). However, Caltech is pretty small, so it can be hard to meet new people. That said, there\u2019s a decent chunk of people that get married shortly after Caltech to people they met here. Summed up, if it happens, it\u2019ll really happen. If not, don\u2019t be too surprised.",

    "postText": " Hi!\n\nSo today I got a call saying that I was admitted to Caltech off the waitlist (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). I am currently committed to UC Berkeley for a double major in CS and DS. Now I'm not so sure where to go.\n\nMy main issue with Caltech stands in my major: CS is what I applied for. My main goal after undergrad is to 1) get a Master's, and 2) work in healthcare technology, in industry jobs combining machine learning and health (ex: companies like Verily, Tempus, Insitro, etc). Does Caltech prepare you for industry? I've heard the education is very theoretical, and doesn't really prepare you for the real world. Is it true that Caltech is better for those wanting to obtain a master's degree?\n\nIn undergrad, I also want to do research on technological applications to health inequities. Berkeley has a Digital Health Equity and Access Lab - Caltech has nothing of the sort from what I've researched, no machine learning + health labs. I'm not sure what kind of research I would do there; I'm not too interested in machine learning theory.\n\nBut Caltech offers more personalized education to undergrads with a much lower class size. The faculty, from what I've seen, is incredible. The campus is breathtaking. This year's class seems so interesting and unique... it's a very difficult decision, and I'm lucky to have it, but I am very confused.\n\nAny advice (like literally ANYTHING) is appreciated. What do you think I should do?",

You\u2019ll learn much more relevant things about your career in your first job than college. (Or maybe I\u2019m saying that because I felt that Caltech didn\u2019t teach me too much SWE stuff?)\n\nIn any case, I\u2019d choose based on how you think you\u2019ll enjoy what the schools have to offer more than how it\u2019ll affect your employment opportunities. I think the opportunities are similar at both schools, but Caltech might give you a slight edge, given how exclusive of a school it is. Culturally Caltech and cal are very different schools too, so make sure you know what you\u2019re getting into. I personally loved Caltech but acknowledge that the experience isn\u2019t for everyone :p",

While you might get a little more personalized attention at Caltech due to the smaller size and community, you'll have a lot more breadth of options, personalities, and classes at a bigger school. I think you'll also find more people excited about societal problems at Berkeley than at Caltech. From my time on campus it felt a lot more isolated and apolitical than what you'll see at any UC school.",

For my year (2018), at my house alone, out of about 20+ people, at least 4 went onto study at Stanford, and one or two is at Harvard getting their PhDs. \n\nAs for your major, Berkeley's CS is a stronger program than Caltech's CS, but CS major nowadays are so sought after and you wouldn't have any issue landing internships/research opportunities/jobs with Caltech on your resume if you are driven, have good GPAs, and have done personal coding projects on the side (and lots of LeetCode). However, Berkeley might be overpopulated with CS majors and it's really difficult to get into classes afaik. There's also a housing crisis, among other really unpleasant things. If you want to be in a tight knitted community and don't mind putting up a lot of work for a very rigorous curriculum, I'd say go for Caltech, which will place you into a top grad school if you have the right GPAs/research experience/internships/rec letters from professors. Caltech's baseline curriculum is going to be more challenging than that of Berkeley, so be mentally prepared that you will need to work very hard at Caltech, which is worth it imo.",

I saw that most people are convincing you to go to Berkeley in the post you posted in the Berkeley sub, but you have to realize that they\u2019re Berkeley student and won\u2019t talk about the bads. I know that CS at Berkeley is very impacted and they are facing funding crisis. So despite Berkeley has a bigger CS department, you\u2019ll prolly need to compete with thousands of CS kids which might make it harder to participate in research. And personally, I think going to Caltech is way impressive and it\u2019ll prolly sets you up for grad school better. I would choose Caltech personally, and it\u2019s not even a question.",

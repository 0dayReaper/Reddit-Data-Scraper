Does anyone know what my transcripts should look like or any advice to help me get in?  I'm planning on visiting the school's counseling staff this winter but would like to ask the ever-so-helpful Reddit first. ",

            "comment": "Honest answer: don't set your heart too much on any one school.  CalTech is small and there are a ton of qualified applicants, so no matter how great you are, there's an element of randomness.  Do you happen to catch the reader of your application on a shitty day?  Did you mention something a reader has a personal connection to?  Were you too similar to the last application the reader approved.\n\nIt's a crapshoot, but the good news is that there are a lot of great programs out there, so apply to several of them.\n\nBest of luck.",

The admissions office is really looking for people who demonstrate not just mere competency, but a passion for science, math, or engineering. Usually extracurriculars are the best way to show that. Are you involved in any kind of research, competitive math or competitive science, high-level science fairs like Intel or Siemens, or taking courses from local colleges because high school classes aren't challenging enough? If you already said yes to all of the above, you probably don't need a great transcript (though lots of A's in high school should be easy at this point anyways). Otherwise, on top of that great transcript, you need something that sets you apart from the rest of the field.",

Planning to take calculus and chemistry at my local college this summer and trying to do an internship at Boeing too, since they've offered it to past students at my school.  How heavily do they look upon extra circulars? ",

I do know that current Caltech students will (at some point in the process) read your application as a whole, and judge your application as a whole. They know how tough Caltech is, and are looking for people who will not only survive in that environment, but excel.\n\nSo extracurriculars are important since they show that you're not only fulfilling the mandatory minimum, but seeking out and exploiting opportunities. The college classes and Boeing internship look *very* good. Traditional extracurriculars like volunteer work and school leadership are nice, but I don't think they're that important (I didn't do either of those in high school). If you're in Orange County, California, I'd recommend joining your high school math team and also the SoCal section of ARML (American Regions Math League) which has practices at CSULB. I met quite a few friends in the teams and in competitions who went with me to Caltech which meant (1) there's probably a correlation there and (2) I had a small head start on making friends when I first got to Caltech.\n\nI don't think a high GPA is necessarily mandatory, but at some point your application has to kind of explain why that high GPA is naturally coming easy to you. Maybe you're taking so many extracurriculars. Maybe you get lower grades in English and history classes (which isn't good, but I wouldn't look too hard on it--you probably shouldn't be having much trouble getting A's in math and science classes). Maybe you have a hard home life--in which case that might be a story you can use for one of your essays. You don't necessarily have say one of these particular things. But your application reads like a story to the readers. And if that story has an unanswered question--why does this otherwise excellent applicant have a mediocre GPA?--it just leaves a bunch of doubt there.",

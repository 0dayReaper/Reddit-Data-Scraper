The Honor Code is still taken seriously as far as I can tell, even with virtual classes. Unfortunately, the South Hovse fireplaces were inspected and administration/housing decided they it wasn't worth spending the money to bring them up to code, so they've been blocked off and replaced with a digital fire/heater. I know both Blacker and Dabney used the fireplaces up until they were removed (Blacker much more so, it was nearly constantly on), and Ricketts and Fleming probably did as well, although I'm not 100% sure.",

During finals there was coordinated play at exactly 7am or something and the gearheads had superior sound systems. Seriously loud. The firepit was in one of the courtyards: a giant piece of cement culvert: a fire was built and dedicants would approach with trays of sawdust to simultaneously toss over the flames. 30\u2019 fireballs. \u201cPyromania is a prerequisite for genius.\u201d",

I was a Mole, though, so I spent more time with the Blacker fireplace.\n\nLet's just say that being indoors didn't necessarily affect the Blacker fireplace's role in promoting pyromania.",

KPCC (I think - one of the public radio stations) played it once at 7:00 especially for Techers, so lots of folks were blasting it simultaneously.  Another time, someone started watching Apocalypse Now at like 6:30 or so in the morning.  So it would sync up with that epic helicopter scene where they're playing The Ride right at 7.  He had a great sound system and blasted it.  There was another time that an entire alley played it at once.  The old network wiring was basically twisted copper wire.  So they used it as a big network of speaker cable and hooked everyone's speakers up to that.\n\nThis was all in Page btw.  I know I've heard it from Lloyd a few times also.",

    "postText": "Hi all, I'm a rising fourth-year undergraduate physics major from a large public research university (very strong in physics). Most of my undergraduate coursework is in physics with some (3-4) astro/planetary electives. I'm interested in studying theoretical/computational astrophysics. On the Caltech admissions sites, it notes that a larger proportion of graduate students studying theoretical astrophysics tend to come from the physics dept. rather than from astronomy. But I was wondering if anybody had any further insights or statistics on acceptance rates of either program, number of students accepted in each cycle, etc..., or just any general advice on whether I should apply to the physics or astronomy PhD programs. Is one program more competitive than the other? Since my undergraduate major is in physics and not astrophysics, would I have a better chance of applying to the physics program? Any advice is appreciated!",

            "comment": "Hi! Take everything I say as an anecdote, but I was a physics major who was admitted to the Caltech physics PhD program for theoretical/ computational cosmology. For PhD programs in general, physics programs tend to take more students than astro programs. Physics programs usually aim to have a class of 20-40 students, depending on the size of the department. Astronomy programs usually have in the ballpark of 5 students per year. \n\nLast year, I think Caltech physics admitted ~50/ 1050 applicants for the PhD program. No idea what the numbers for astro were like. Anyway, this is my longwinded way of saying that statistically, you\u2019re better off applying to physics. However, I don\u2019t think astro programs would care much about your degree being in physics\u2014 as long as your coursework and research experience is relevant to astrophysics. \nGood luck, and I\u2019m happy to answer any other questions!",

The big points I'm aware of are that:\n\n* The astro program requires 10 classes while the physics department only requires 6 (although, at least in physics, it's common for theory students to take more than the minimum).\n* By the end of their second year, physics students must pass a written qual. At the end of their first year, astro students must present on their research and pass an oral qual.",

So a huge portion of people in the field have degrees that, if you went and looked, actually say physics on them. So at least in general, a physics degree shouldn't be any hindrance in applying (esp at undergrad level, astrophysics is not a common degree, all in all)",

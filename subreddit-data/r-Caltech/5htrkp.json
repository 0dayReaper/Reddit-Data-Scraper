Sometime next term I'll try to meet with the necessary administrators to get the student store to carry some of these shirts. \n\nIf you too would like to contribute to better Caltech t-shirts, then post in the comments below or message me. Digital media experience (e.g. Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign) is helpful, but so are hand-sketched designs! (Although I can't promise I'll be good enough with Illustrator to faithfully render a sketch).\n\nIf you've never designed t-shirts before, here are some guidelines:\n\n(1) Use a small number of solid colors (the cost per unit increases substantially with each new color).\n\n(2) Don't feel constrained to Caltech colors (although if you can think up a cool orange and white shirt, more power to you).\n\n(3) Avoid significantly altering existing Caltech symbols. The more a design deviates from guidelines listed here (https://identity.caltech.edu/standards/visual), the less likely administrators are to approve said design. You can probably deviate from those guidelines a little bit though, insofar as I've seen Caltech administration distribute Caltech gear that violates those style guidelines.\n\n(4) Consider working with a blank t-shirt template (either in a digital media editor or when sketching) to see how the design looks in proportion with the rest of the shirt.\n",

The icon isn't in the public domain (even if it was, there are still trademark issues to deal with). Sure, Caltech doesn't have to worry about us trying to make money off these shirts, but our super-tiny population makes branding and \"identity\" very important to administration. Best to avoid shooting ourselves in the foot by going around them (at least, for now ;)).",

I will see what can be done about this. \n\nIn general I think that Caltech would benefit greatly from adopting a model where designs are printed on vinyl ahead of time, then applied to blanks (shirts, sweatshirts) with one of these bad boys:\n\nhttp://www.proworldinc.com/heat-transfer-press/garment-presses/hp-hix-sw25-hix-swingman-20x25-heat-press.html\n\n. With such an approach it would be very easy for Caltech to \"stock\" a huge range of colors and fits (woman's cuts, slim / fitted, etc..) without investing heavily in any one visual design.",

They print out a single sample of each shirt and hang it on a rack. When you find one you want, you point to it, specify a color, and they make it there in front of you. The whole transaction takes about 90 seconds!",

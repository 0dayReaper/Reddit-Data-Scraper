The turtle pond has rocks organized by geological origin, which might be cool for you, and there's a plaque for Beckmann's invention of the pH meter, and there's the Gene pool and some other geeky art.  Go up to the top of Milikan library if you can get in and take in the view.\n\nThere won't be any on campus lunch options on Saturday (except the C Store) but if you walk to Lake and head a few blocks north of campus there's a billion restaurants.  The Counter has great burgers, or Lemonade is good if you want something lighter.",

If you're looking to be a grad student, then you just have to go and make the right undergrad friends I think.",

Broad only has sandwiches and the line gets long at lunch. Hit up Chandler, the Mongolian BBQ, pizza, and salads are all really good.\n\nIn Arms (a Geo building), there is a rock collection which is super cool and a saber tooth cat. \n\nAre you only going to be there Saturday? Because everything is shut down (the buildings, cafeterias, tours, etc). I would recommend spending a night on campus and visiting on a weekday to get the full experience.",

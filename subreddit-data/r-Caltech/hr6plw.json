This will reduce student density in the residences and  will maintain an appropriate student-to-restroom ratio. For fall term,  and perhaps for the remainder of the 2020-2021 academic year, Avery and  the South Houses will be reserved as quarantine and isolation spaces for  residential students in the event a student falls ill or becomes  symptomatic.\n\nWho gets to be on-campus: \n\n&gt;To support the limited re-occupation of on-campus residences, we  expect to invite undergraduate students to campus in the stages that  follow. It is important to emphasize that changes in public health  conditions and government directives at any time may restrict our  ability to accommodate all groups of students.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1. Continuing students whose essential academic progress this year requires enrollment in courses with in-person components.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. International students whose presence on campus is required for maintenance of immigration status.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. Students  who demonstrate that their personal, financial, or academic situation  requires special consideration for on-campus housing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;4. First-year  and new transfer students, along with some upper-class student advisors  to support the residential experience of other students.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Depending on availability of space, continuing students who may have a  nonacademic reason to be on campus, such as student athletes, also may  have an opportunity to return to campus.\n\nHouse system:\n\n&gt;While we understand that house affiliation in an important part of  the residential experience for many undergraduate students, the current  limits on occupancy and requirements for maintaining quarantine and  isolation space will not allow us to offer rooms in all of the houses.  For this reason, we will be making spaces available in the undergraduate  residences in the fall term, but we will not be reopening the houses.  House communities and the house experience will remain virtual for the  fall term and likely for the coming academic year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Similarly, the  restrictions on social gatherings and activities prohibit Caltech from  being able to allow for Rotation, a valued Caltech tradition that helps  welcome new students to campus and inaugurate the academic year.  Rotation activities are intensively and extensively social in ways that  are risky and inappropriate given COVID-19 conditions. For these  reasons, Fall term rotation has been cancelled, and the assignment of  incoming students to house communities will be discussed with student  leadership during the fall term.\n\nMore information I can't be bothered to copy-paste at [https://coronavirus.caltech.edu/fall-2020-plan](https://coronavirus.caltech.edu/fall-2020-plan).",

            "comment": "A little confused as to why athletics is a good reason to have some people live on campus... everything else on the list is just to meet minimal academic/legal necessities, but athletics would be a risky excess. If there's spare space it'd probably be safer just to leave things more empty than the limit rather than pad the population for nonacademic/non-legal reasons.\n\nThe rest of this makes sense - although I hope  a way to do some sort of rotation-like thing (not in person ofc but some kind of maybe virtual placeholder) can happen. I guess that's what the \"discussions w/ student leadership\" will be about - if they happen in good faith on the part of admin.",

            "comment": "So when they say they \u201cexpect to invite undergraduate students to campus in the stages that follow,\u201d does that mean that every student that falls under one of the four stages will be invited (e.g., all freshman will be invited even if all people from stages 1-3 opt to come to campus)? Or that they\u2019ll send out the email for stage one, then if there\u2019s still room left they\u2019ll send out the email for stage two, then if there\u2019s still room left they\u2019ll send out the email for stage three, and so on?\n\nThe fact that it\u2019s in a stage structure makes me think it\u2019s the latter, but the wording of the document makes me think it\u2019s the former.\n\nEdit: After rereading, I\u2019m pretty certain all freshmen are being invited, but I\u2019ll still leave this up in case anyone thinks otherwise",

            "comment": "The test-blindness is only for academic tests, Caltech still requires an English test for international students whose native language isn't English. The TOEFL IBT is one of the ones accepted, but you can also take the Duolingo English Test. All the info can be found on the admissions website: [https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/apply/first-year-freshman-applicants/international-citizens](https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/apply/first-year-freshman-applicants/international-citizens)",

It's definitely the name of a division at Caltech (similar to UC Berkeley's \"College of Engineering\").\n\nIf it is in fact an actual undergraduate major, then it is most likely similar to Harvey Mudd's undergraduate engineering program.

I don't remember many classmates who majored in E&amp;AS, though I do remember the joke \"You can't spell 'easy' without E&amp;AS!\"\n\nMost majors have sub specialty concentrations. I majored in chemistry and there was the option to focus on organic, inorganic, physical or biochemistry, for example.",

I was an EE though and most of the time they were EEs who couldn't handle the later courses and switched or they wanted more CS emphasis.  Come to think of it I don't think CS was it's own degree back then and CS fell under E&amp;AS at the time.  But it's been a while so I could be misremembering.",

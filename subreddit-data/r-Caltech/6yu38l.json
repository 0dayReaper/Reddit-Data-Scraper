    "postText": "I recently in-processed at JPL, and coincidentally I am planning to go to Disneyland next month. It turns out that there aren't many discounts available for one-day park hoppers, but [this page](http://www.cpa.caltech.edu/postdoc_resources/discounts) says that discounted tickets are available for people at JPL...unfortunately, the page it links to doesn't exist anymore, and [the list that DOES exist on that site](http://culinartonline.com/jpl/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Employee-Activities.pdf) is both extremely out of date (2016) and doesn't list Disneyland.\n\nAm I just out of luck here, or is there some hidden secret way to get discounted tickets?\n\nEDIT: I'm not living in the area, so I don't have access to any of the SoCal resident deals, and I wouldn't get much value out of an annual pass. Even if I can't get any JPL discount, I'd appreciate any other general tips for getting discounted tickets.",

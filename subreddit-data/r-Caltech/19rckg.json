As to who is being punished and who it's on, this is the only info I can give you:\n\nThe original email:\n&gt;Dear members of Ricketts House,\n&gt;\n&gt;This afternoon, the ExCom of Ricketts is having a meeting with senior\n&gt;administration.  They are being told the following:****\n&gt;\n&gt;The Administration has become aware of incidents that violate Institute\n&gt;policy, which were led by and involved students in Ricketts House.\n&gt; Because of the egregious nature of the actions  both actual and planned\n&gt;the Administration has no choice but to intervene.  Details will remain\n&gt;confidential.\n&gt;\n&gt;The following measures are being taken:\n&gt;\n&gt;\tWe are removing the leadership of Ricketts House from their\n&gt;positions, effective immediately.  They will be allowed to stay in the\n&gt;house for the remainder of this year, but they have lost the privilege of\n&gt;representing their peers.  The RAs and the RLC will work with the house to\n&gt;select a new leadership team.\n&gt;\n&gt;\tThe houses bursars account has been frozen, and no social\n&gt;events will be approved until further notice.\n&gt;\n&gt;\tRicketts will not participate in rotation this fall.  The\n&gt;method for assigning freshmen to the house will be determined at a later\n&gt;date.\n&gt;\n&gt;\tCurrent members of Ricketts are not guaranteed a spot in the\n&gt;house next year.  They will need to apply along with any other interested\n&gt;students, and residency will be approved by the deans office.  Again,\n&gt;details will be forthcoming.\n&gt;\n&gt;\tFinally, any violations of Caltech policy, the Honor Code, or\n&gt;applicable laws will be dealt with appropriately and swiftly.\n&gt;\n&gt;\tPlease understand that we are very disappointed in the behavior of these\n&gt;students, which fell far short of the standards expected by members of the\n&gt;Caltech community.  Student self-governance is a valuable and important\n&gt;characteristic of the Caltech experience.  However, when it does not work,\n&gt;the privilege mustand willbe revoked, in order to protect our students,\n&gt;our community, and Caltech itself.\n\nAnd a quote from someone on the IHC:\n&gt;In light of all the rumours you might have heard, here are the facts:\n&gt;1. Beth Larranaga sent out an email from Dean Kiewiet this afternoon stating that:\n&gt;a. the Ricketts Excomm is immediately stripped of their positions, and a new leadership team will be selected\n&gt;b. no Ricketts social events can happen, as their bursar's account was frozen\n&gt;c. Ricketts cannot participate in Rotation 2013.\n&gt;d. current Ricketts members are not guaranteed a housing spot in Ricketts next year\n&gt;2. While the message from Kiewiet says \"the Administration has no choice but to intervene,\" no one in the administration knew what was going on until today (except for Kiewiet, apparently). The decision was likely not only his, but rest assured that even most of the admins were surprised. This was not a general admin decision.",

If they are talking, there would immediately be information about what they were accused of. If there isn't, my guess is a drug/alcohol offense. That would be something they'd protest but which he'd be right to quash. Mere hazing wouldn\u2019t be given the silent treatment at all. \n\nCaltech undergraduates are really abysmally stupid when it comes to looking at similar infractions at other schools and the media attention said infractions received. Do that. Otherwise, I have to assume some form of legal guilt, as any grey area wouldn't be met with silence. \n\nAlso, the entire student body has never gone ahead and nuked prefrosh weekend or the institute as a whole. If a majority of people were legitimately mad about something which they were in the right on, both of those would be rational responses. ",

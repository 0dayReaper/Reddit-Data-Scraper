    "postText": "Hi everyone! A friend and I are interning this summer at Caltech and are looking for affordable month to month housing. Somewhere around $650-900 (after split) a month is ideal. Preferably 2 bedroom, but one bedroom can be considered. We would also like to live on our own, without other roommates. Please leave a comment or PM me if you know of anything available!",

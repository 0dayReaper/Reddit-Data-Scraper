    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a non-Caltech student applying for Astronomy/Physics SURF this year. Based on the website, 85% of applicants get accepted every year. \n\nMy question is who determines the admission of SURF?  The Caltech faculty mentor or the the admission committee? How do I maximize my chance of getting in? \n\nWill this SURF increase my chance in getting into Caltech for grad school when I apply next year? And can you please provide some suggestions for getting into Caltech for Astronomy PhD? \n\n\nI truly appreciate your help.\n\nEdited: SURF ACCEPTED",

            "comment": "Since you are not a Caltech student, I think you should expect an admissions process more competitive than 85% admit rate. \n\nBack of the envelope estimate: if 2/3 of SURF students are from Caltech and have a 100% admit rate then non-Caltech students should have a 55% admit rate. My figures are very rough but qualitatively this trend seems right. \n\nWho determines admission? My guess is both the prof and the SFP office have to want you. My guess is the prof is the limiting factor (so if you get them to want you that's probably most of the way to acceptance).\n\nWill it increase your chances? Indirectly and instrumentally yes for three reasons. One, having more research experience makes for a stronger PhD application. Two, you can get a good rec letter from the prof you work with. Three, if you work well with that prof, they might be happy to be your PI if you go to Caltech for grad school. But hopefully you are doing the SURF because you like research, not just for gaining prestige.",

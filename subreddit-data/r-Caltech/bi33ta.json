Six years happens sometimes, but longer than that is quite rare - I would guess that a large majority of the roughly 5-10 percent of students who haven't graduated after six years have dropped out, transferred, or taken multiple years away from school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFA has some unit-based restrictions on students staying after 4 years, but I believe these are pretty lenient, like \"you get regular FA unless you've exceeded the units requirement by 50%\" and a couple of other caveats. DON'T QUOTE ME ON THIS - I don't know the policy and you should try calling the office to see what the official rules are. But I know at least a couple of current students, one about to enter their fifth year and another who wrapped up last term in their sixth year, both of whom were/are getting full/near-full FA. They both seemed to think that Caltech was pretty good about this issue.",

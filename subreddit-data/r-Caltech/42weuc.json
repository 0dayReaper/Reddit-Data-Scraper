    "postText": "**I\u2019m a Caltech grad student and I\u2019m going to be writing anonymously.**\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOver the past few months I\u2019ve found myself typing into Google \u201cI hate Caltech,\u201d trying to find some satisfying anti-Caltech comments to empathize with and help me vent. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI feel like I can\u2019t complain about Caltech to my fellow students; if you complain it looks like a sign that you personally are just doing poorly, and so you are mad. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019ve done well in classes. I passed my qualifying exam on my first try. My peers know I\u2019m smart. But I am mad, here\u2019s why:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1\\. My first research advisor was unprofessional. He told me repeatedly that I \"didn\u2019t know how to do research.\" He told me that I was not working hard. He told me at one point that I didn\u2019t know how to read. When I left his group, he said unprofessional things about me to the other graduate students in the research group. I'm still left wondering if the fact that I am a woman caused him to treat me differently. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2\\. My department is Really unorganized. Last year my department devised a new set of classes that are required for all new students. Almost ALL the classes I took in my first year were completely NEW classes, and the class organization, the lectures, and the homeworks had definite BUGS. We were unfortunate guinea pigs.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3\\. The date of the PhD qualifying exam kept being postponed, for over a month. It was the biggest test of the year, but we didn\u2019t know if suddenly they would say, \u2018Oh, we scheduled your test for tomorrow.\u2019 If the department doesn't take the students' time seriously, how are we going to take them seriously? This kind of behavior would be unacceptable in an industry or professional setting. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI could go on, but I don\u2019t want to complain. I want to move on, and focus on my research. But something last week brought it all back. I read the BuzzFeed and NYT articles about two girls who were harassed by a professor. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI feel lucky that my first advisor wasn\u2019t as bad as that. But he made me feel terrible, and I really did question my worth as a researcher. I felt that maybe some of the things he said to me were at least partly true. And I am a woman, and I really hope that he didn\u2019t treat me differently because of it. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI\u2019ve found a new advisor, and things are generally OK. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**But, I still feel mad.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI feel that Caltech is not giving me what I need as a researcher. The departments are very small, and I don\u2019t have enough people to interact with. I went to a large university for my undergrad, and everyone bounced ideas off of each other. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, sometimes I stand in the main lobby of my building, at 1pm, and no one else is to been seen. Only maybe a secretary, always an older woman, will walk by, and smile at me. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Does anyone else feel the same way?**\n",

Your first advisor sounds like an unprofessional jerk, and it is very unfortunate that your department's lack of organization is affecting the students.\n\nThat's in the past and can't be changed. And speaking of changing I'm going to ignore your question because even if others do feel the same way how would that materially help you or change your experience?\n\nI'm instead focusing on this one statement:\n\n&gt; I feel that Caltech is not giving me what I need as a researcher. \n\nIf you really feel that way then you need to go to another school. That's easy to say but it may not be easy to implement. Moreover, it may be the case that although Caltech isn't giving you what you **want**, your experiences (\"I felt that maybe some of the things he said to me were at least partly true\", and not having a big group to bounce ideas off of will force you to become more self-reliant which is an incredibly important skill for a researcher) may be providing what you **need** to be successful.\n\nI encourage you to take a step back, think about what your end goals are (after a PhD), and figure out how you can best achieve those. Maybe Caltech figures into those. Maybe not.",

I personally feel very lucky to have an advisor here who I really get along with and to be in a department that I feel cares about me. I can't say the same about some other departments though.\n\nSorry for any typos, this was from my phone.",

In small settings where everyone sees themselves as a competitor, a toxic environment can form where you can't get help from your fellow graduate students. I've seen this kind of subtle shade being thrown, and the attendant super-positive spin people put on things to keep from looking weak.\n\nThe counseling center might be a great option \u2014 or just talk to other students who are dealing with different sets of issues with different advisors/types of work. Talk to Felicia or someone in the dean's office about the unacceptable administrative lapses. I don't know if any of this would work for you (or if you've tried it already) but maybe?",

If the department isn't teaching you well as graduate students, that's an issue. \\#3 is just an offshoot of \\#2, but you should be prepared to take that test wherever and whenever. If you aren't, you're not ready to get a PhD.\n\nYour unnamed \\#4 is important, and you actually should have finished with it as a number. It's possible your advisor was sexist, but rather than mention the other guy at Caltech, you could have just said, \"I experienced a similar attitude.\" That would be vague enough for people to accept that you weren't immediately drawing conclusions but had reasonable suspicion.\n\nAs for bouncing ideas... If you want to collaborate with people and they don't want to, that's an issue that you can solve later. However, you're being trained right now to be as good of a researcher as you can be. Making you do that on your own is punishing but worthwhile - it will make you a stronger researcher.\n\nWe in the academic world honestly do not give a flying crap about your emotions. The girls who had sexual harassment had legitimate grievances, as they could be (and were being!) affected by a characteristic (their gender) out of their control. But if you feel sad because grad school is stressful, get over it. That's grad school.",

There are resources like the counseling center (and potentially a meeting with a department chair or dean) that could help this person cope. \n\nYou are doing Caltech a disservice by greeting their call for help with such an insensitive attitude. Would you have been so uncaring to this person's face? In front of colleagues?\n\n\"Give a man a mask, and he will reveal his true self.\" - Oscar Wilde (i think)\n\nEDIT: I should add how does promoting your brand of academic machismo help anyone, or Caltech as an institution, or academia and society as a whole? Scores of talented people have been lost too early to depression and suicide (Boltzmann, Turing, Hemingway, Karyotakis, Woolfe, Wallace, Caltech's own Andrew Lange in 2010...). That list doesn't include the untold thousands of graduate students and early career people who had yet to make their potential mark. Not only from suicide, but just by being driven out of an academic culture that people like you insist upon continuing.",

People who bail and talk about \"how hard\" graduate school is haven't had to fight tooth and nail for grant funding. They haven't had to have political battles with people FAR superior to them in every way possible - fame, intelligence, university backing. You'll have to do this if you continue, and you won't always win battles. It's not easy. It's fulfilling if you like it, but never think the world gets easier if you progress toward what some consider \"success\".\n\nAnd if you think people like me are somehow \"causing\" this, you're insane. I'm not a federal government in charge of funding, slowly diminishing the money I dole out. I'm not an institution who only rewards those who do superhuman (aka psychotic) amounts of research. All of the causes of this sort of stress are external, and they select a group of faculty members who are either already hard or made hard by it.\n\nIf she can't hack it, she should leave. That's no disrespect to her worth as a human being, but if she thinks that it's bad now, she's not cut out for what follows.",

But, you are contributing to perpetuating an academic system that requires 'superhuman amounts of research'.  One that doesn't treat people like people. \n\nYou may not control grant funding or be a university trustee/president/dean/whatever , but you do control your allocation of kindness towards others. \n\nYou don't know what she can hack or can't. Or how she will grow as a person. \n\nWhat the rest of us do know is that you are a dick.\n\n",

I've worked with monsters, but I'm not one.\n\nI also know that trying to change the system that promotes psychopaths is pissing in the ocean. I won't defend Caltech, because god only knows they're not making life easier for anyone, but if this little amount of stress has caused her to freak out, I can't believe that she'll make it.\n\nI guess it's philosophical - some people believe that all people, even professionals, have moments of weakness and that we can respond with kindness and empathy to get them through it. Other people will disrespect her as soon as she ever shows weakness and will literally never, ever forget it, and will use it against her. The latter people are unfortunately a large portion of the super-successful people, and that's never going to change. I see no need to encourage behavior from her that could harm her in the long run, so I respond with a small amount of harshness. You can think I'm a dick, but if she really wants to succeed, she's got to learn self-control.",

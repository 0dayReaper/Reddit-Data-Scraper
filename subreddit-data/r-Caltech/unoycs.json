    "postText": "\"We change the world, one story at a time.\" Richard Wagamese \n\nI will be visiting Pasadena until May 17. I'm here for work at Caltech to work in the astronomy department. \n\nI'd love to meet up with people to take their photos and hear their stories for my project 'Humans of this Pale Blue Dot'. All are welcome to participate. \n\n'Humans of this Pale Blue Dot' consists of photographs and stories of a diverse slice of humans. \n\nYou can find more info at our website (socials etc): HumansPaleBlueDot.com\n\nYou can submit your photo/story online as well. \n\nThanks in advance! \n\nThis project is inspired by Humans of New York, the Pale Blue Dot image of the only home humans have ever known, and the beautiful words of Carl Sagan.",

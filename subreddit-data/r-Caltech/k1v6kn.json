    "postText": "Can you get your PhD in ChemE but work for a prof in Chemistry? I'm uncertain because on the Caltech website chemistry and chemE profs are both under the Divison of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, but they are separate degree programs. I'm largely interested in ChemE and ChemE labs, but there is one lab in chemistry that is really speaking to me.",

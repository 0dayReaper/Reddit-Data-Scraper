    "postText": "Hi there, I'm an international student with UK qualifications who's going to apply to Caltech this winter. I'm currently doing AS Pure Maths, AS Further Maths and AS Physics, and I'm going to continue all three throughout A2. Does anyone know whether these are sufficient preparation in terms of calculus and proof to realistically transfer into Caltech? Also, what grades do successful international UK applicants usually have? Thanks!",

(At least, it was for me on Edexcel Maths and FM, AQA Physics). \n\nMy predicted grades were A\\*A\\*A with a Disintction*Distinction*Distinction in BTEC Engineering, but my grades came out lower than this due to the entire CAG thing. Didn\u2019t get rescinded though :)",

I ended up in the remedial section of math1a because of a mistranslation between school systems, and all of that content was in A-Level maths and further maths (calculus, and proofs by induction and contradiction). I don\u2019t know if these appear in the regular math1a class, which is apparently proof-based mainly, or whether you\u2019re expected to know them. Maybe somebody could comment on this. \n\nCaltech also runs a summer mini-class before your freshman year called Ma0. It\u2019s a great class to make sure you know the proof stuff you need in order to survive Math1a. You don\u2019t get credit for it, but it\u2019s helpful.",

They give a diagnostic to see your level of math ability (if you don\u2019t do well, you get put in the remedial section). At the top there was a box that you could tick if you hadn\u2019t had a calculus course before. Because our course isn\u2019t based solely on Calc, I assumed we wouldn\u2019t cover as much as the Calc courses in the US so ticked the box. I was pretty wrong though. A-Level maths and further maths covers almost everything (besides L\u2019Hopital and fundamental theorems) covered in US high school Calc.",

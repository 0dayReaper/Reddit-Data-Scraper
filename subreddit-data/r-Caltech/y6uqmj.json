    "postText": "i will be doing REA to caltech, and i was wondering what the whole housing system is like? i love the smaller community, as i value deeper connections w students and professors, but i am also a bit of a claustrophobe. in other words, i really cannot tolerate living in a confined space with other people due to the fear of illness haha.\n\ni know stanford has an amazing campus (sorry if i offended you), but i never got to see what caltech's dorm campus is like. do you guys like it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...also is the food good?",

The houses have various slogans or phrases associated with them. Dabney's slogan is, for whatever reason\\*, \"Dabney Eats It\". The initials, DEI, are accordingly found *all* over. All over the house, but also just ... all over.\n\nIt's one of the [very few pieces of graffiti that is tagged on celestial bodies besides Earth](https://lenin.caltech.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=dei).\n\n\\*There is a reason, click the link to read more of the history. Basically, a very old criticism of the food.",

There\u2019s a reason a shit ton of vaccines are required for all students. As for claustrophobia\u2026 bechtel with our singles within the suites would probably be the best fit, but they\u2019re also very isolating and can take you away from the houses and house culture if that\u2019s something you want. Citing my suitemate u/sci-punk for this as I scooped what she was about to say lmao",

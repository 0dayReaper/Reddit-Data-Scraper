I don't really know if I'd enjoy how small it is, since I've never attended.\n\nDo you ever get bored in Pasadena?

Berkeley was just too big and liberal and overcrowded for my tastes.\n\nWhat are some things about Caltech that you love/hate and why?\nIt's basically impossible to not get research and job opportunities as Caltech CS. The breadth of courses available is sad though.\n\nHow do you feel about the size of Caltech? I don't really know if I'd enjoy how small it is, since I've never attended.\nIt's fucking tiny. I like it, some don't.\n\nDo you ever get bored in Pasadena? Is there a lot to do outside of campus?\nThere's lots to do off campus. Most of us are just too lazy to go into LA regularly though.\n\nAre there strong campus events, clubs, and activities?\nMostly just house activities.\n\nHow bad/good is core?\nCore isn't as hardcore as it used to be, but its still a little bit harder than AP x.\n\nIs the dismantling of the House system really going to affect the quality of the school?\nNo, we just like to whine and dramaticize everything.\n\nIs it easy to get internships and job opportunities?\nYes.\n\nHow is stress culture and mental health at Caltech?\nYou can get a CS degree averaging like 4-5 courses per term. It's not as bad as people say. Assuming you skip lecture like most CS students, expect to put in ~30hrs/wk if you're aiming for a 3.5-3.8.\n\nDo you think there's anything unexpected I should consider (i.e. not mentioned in any of these questions) when choosing between these schools?\nBerkeley girls are cuter.\n",

            "comment": "I was accepted to both Berkeley and Caltech but went to Caltech. \n\nMy parents' friend had a son who went to Berkeley. She warned us about getting lost at Berkeley because of its size. The story is that her son didn't get much guidance from his advisor and perhaps wasn't very aggressive about taking the right classes, and took a long time to graduate. This caused my mom to panic and change her mind about making me go to Berkeley, when before, she was all over Berkeley. But at Caltech I was lost, too, from the difficulty of the classes and not knowing what I wanted to do. The only advice I got from my advisor was that maybe I shouldn't go to college. (This was because I mentioned system administration as a possible career choice. Back then I thought it would be cool to hack around on the command line. Now I actually am a sysadmin, and it kind of sucks because I'm not good with computers and don't like to maintain systems. Most of I do I learned from Googling.) \n\n&gt; Do you ever get bored in Pasadena? Is there a lot to do outside of campus?\n\nPasadena has a couple of museums, the Huntington Library, and numerous hiking trails in the San Gabriel Mountains. However, as a student, I didn't go out much.\n\n&gt; Are there strong campus events, clubs, and activities?\n\nCaltech has plenty of clubs, but sometimes they die out because there aren't enough new officers. It's fairly easy to start a club if you get a couple of students together who can serve as officers. It's also easy to get on the sports teams, and I think a fairly large portion of students participate in sports. Coaches are aware of the students' workload. In case you're interested, the dance scene at Caltech is pretty active, and there's an annual dance show.\n\n&gt; How bad/good is core?\n\nWhen I was a student, core was very rigorous. There was a big gap between AP classes in high school and Caltech's core. Expect heavy proofs and theory. However, core may have become easier recently. \n\nCaltech does not give AP credit. Berkeley does.\n\n&gt; Is the dismantling of the House system really going to affect the quality of the school?\n\nI'm not sure if the quality of the school would be affected. Is house culture a factor that draws students to Caltech? Maybe it is for some, but more students are probably drawn by Caltech's reputation in academics and research. Perhaps the loss of house culture would lead to a weaker support system for students, leading to a lower retention rate. But on the other hand, there are students who don't really fit into or like house culture.\n\n&gt; Is it easy to get internships and job opportunities?\n\nThe top companies recruit from Caltech, so in general, yes. I never did very well finding jobs or internships, but other people did fine. \n\nIt would probably be as easy, if not easier, to find jobs or internships at Berkeley, which has the added benefit of being close to Silicon Valley.\n\n&gt; How is stress culture and mental health at Caltech?\n\nI found Caltech stressful, and so did most of my classmates. I can't say people's mental health was great. I don't know of any suicides at Caltech while I was a student, but there was a rash of suicides a couple of years ago. (At least four students and a professor all killed themselves in a fairly short span of time, and I know of another suicide a couple of years before that.) Caltech has a counseling center, and after the suicides, I think they've been trying to be more visible.\n\nI don't know about Berkeley, but since it's a huge school not known for being easy, it's probably high stress, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Caltech was a poor fit for me because I'm not all that into math, science, engineering, or research, even though I seemed like I was because I had high grades and excellent AP and SAT scores, joined Math League at school, and did Science League, AHSME, and Chemistry Olympiad competitions by default. All the top students at my high school participated in the latter three by default, and I did well on the local and state level. I did not take advantage of the opportunities at Caltech, like research. I could have at least tried out research, but I didn't. I also didn't really fit in at Caltech.\n\nI'm not sure if I would have done well at any top college, or maybe any college at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I love that it was a place of learning that was more than I could handle.\n\n2) I liked how the classes later in your college experience were very small and professors were accessible. I disliked how there were so few classmates that you could never escape into anonymity. Everyone remembers everything about everyone, both good and bad.\n\n3) I never got bored but it was because I was a dancer and Hollywood was nearby. You can also plan trips to vegas easily. Battlefield Vegas to drive a tank, Tempest Freeruning Academy to parkour, dance battles at JUICE, hollywood show auditions. UCLA frat parties.\n\nAlso Blacker house build projects are the best, so was smashing things with sledgehammers, etc.\n\n4) Very unique and plentiful campus events that are extremely out of hand and unlike anything else. Word of caution; participation in the build and the initial tour are the funnest parts. In the actual parties few people actually dance, lots of people are socially awkward. If you are used to more traditional parties with extroverts, go to UCLA parties.\n\n5) Last I heard core was getting easier, but while I was there it was rigorous. Proof-based mathematics, quantum mechanics, relavity were hard, so was thermo for me. No more quantum requirement, so I\u2019ve heard.\n\n6) Yes, it will, in many bad ways as well as good ways. The fratty nature of the house system means that when it is good it is very good, but when it is bad is is extremely bad, with hazing, ostracization. peer pressure. Personally I am a fan of losing the house system.\n\n7) Internships at tech are guaranteed if you apply for SURF. People will hire you after college much more readily, but it is not a magic bullet. It took me 6 months to find a perm job after college, but when they finally interviewed me and saw \u201ccaltech\u201d they let me skip half the interview process and took my 2.7 gpa over 4.0 people from harvard.\n\n8) Stress is utterly through the roof. Mental health help is excellent but it doesn\u2019t matter because you still won\u2019t be able to handle it. My grades slipped in my senior year because I had to live with a guy with mental health issues who wanted to shoot up the school and we had to have him removed by security and get him treated by a psychiatrist.\n\n9) You will not regret choosing caltech.\n\n",

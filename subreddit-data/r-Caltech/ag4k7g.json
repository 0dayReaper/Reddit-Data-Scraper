Is there stuff for parents to do during the PFE or is it not worth it for them to come? We are around 700 miles away from Pasadena.",

However, there is a lot of stuff do do in and around the Pasadena/LA area. IIRC, you are allowed to stay overnight on campus, which I would highly recommend, so you wouldn't need your parents with you.\n\nTraveling by yourself is also a fun experience that's worth having, since you'll likely travel alone to or from Caltech at some point if you choose to enroll.

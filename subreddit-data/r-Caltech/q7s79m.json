Some vegetarians/vegans would complain that it was difficult to get adequate protein, even with special plates.\n\nAlso Haneetman, the source of flexible food outside of normal meal hours, only has one vegan meal -- the avocado toast.",

So if you don\u2019t like what that is (generally is a modification of whatever the omnis are eating)  other options are pretty much salad, rice and beans, or pasta. That said, I haven\u2019t been on a caltech meal plan since COVID started so things may have changed for the better/worse. Tbh, if you have time, it might be worth considering getting off board in future years to make food for yourself (which is cheaper than caltech board anyway)",

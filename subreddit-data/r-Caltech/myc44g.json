    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm trying to decide between U.C. Berkeley M.E.T. (Business+Engineering) and Caltech for Bioengineering.\n\nI'm interested in computational biology and genomics, and definitely want to carry out independent research as an undergraduate.\n\nI also plan on going to graduate school but am not entirely sure yet if that will be a Masters+MBA or a PhD.\n\nThe costs are pretty much identical for me as an international.\n\nWhat do you all think?\n\nThank you in advance!",

UCB is a public school, the school has too many students, Caltech could provide you most better resource. The surrounding environment of UCB is also a major concern. Caltech has a safer campus.",

    "postText": "I will be interning at JPL and was wondering how long the background process takes... Besides a drug test, are there any other processes or documentation I should anticipate? Will I need to pay for an official transcript?\n\nI am excited and anxious and I know it will take a while to get all the ducks in a row, but any more info about the process would be very helpful to ease my anxiety... Also looking to hear from previous JPL interns about their experiences (I'm not a Caltech student, will be coming from a state university). Thanks.",

            "comment": "I also interned at JPL and was not a Caltech student. To be honest I don't remember too much about the background process; It was just one of those tedious processes that should eventually be approved assuming you haven't done anything bad and check out legally (JPL is a government job so they might have some extra requirements concerning citizenship). As for the experience, it's a pretty nice place to work! The people there tend to be on the older side (I'm a software engineer, so my industry is younger on average) and are super nice. The campus is great and the environment is generally pretty laid back. Your day to day will depend on your specific group and project but they hold many talks for interns to learn more about the space program. Also, Pasadena is a very nice community.",

Do you remember if you had to pay/mail to send them an official transcript? Also good to hear about the talks and environment, I'm so excited for this opportunity!!",

            "comment": "Depends on what path. Being a business/Econ major alongside engineering for a startup would make sense, English/Philosophy alongside CS for the linguistics focus could also work, but most of what you would get would be more STEM focused. The Caltech humanities majors are designed to be second majors done alongside a STEM major of some kind. If you want to only do the humanities major, there wouldn\u2019t be much point to doing it here since you\u2019re not going to find that many classes in the field and you can definitely find a better program elsewhere. \n\nAs a guess, if you\u2019re thinking technical writing for an engineering field, that could work, but you\u2019d have to take a lot of the engineering theory courses for the engineering major, which could make you an excellent technical writer (since you know how everything you\u2019re writing about works) if you actually enjoy the classes enough to take them.",

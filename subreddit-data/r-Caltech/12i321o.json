    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am an admit to Caltech and UCLA for undergraduate. When I was accepted to Caltech, my intended major was Chemical Engineering, being different than my declared major at UCLA (neuroscience). However, I am faced with the debacle of debt. If I were to attend Caltech, I would be in debt 76k a year compared to UCLA's 35k a year, looking to perhaps go to medical school (still no clue about this, should probably decide soon). In your opinion, what should I do here? Is Caltech worth nearly 300k of debt for undergraduate, as ridiculous as it seems?\n\nI may also want to go for a MD-PhD, as I have heard Caltech has a partnership with USC in a MD-PhD program. (what I will hopefully go for, an MD-PhD, regardless of where it's at)\n\nAs for family contributions, my family can (barely) afford it, but I don't want to burden them with my decision + my choices.\n\nThanks.",

I didn't have time to do much shadowing or volunteering like many other premeds. High mcat was the only reason I managed to get in.\n\n Caltech will make you into an excellent engineer, but they push you VERY hard. Your GPA is deflated at Caltech, which doesn't look good on med schools apps. Remember, you'll be competing against people with 3.8-4.0 GPAs for med school slots.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Caltech is a wonderful institution with ground breaking research, but it's very punishing for the undergrads and premeds. I had very little time between course work and research, and I felt like I missed out on college experiences that many of my peers had. You'll have just as valuable of engineering degree if you go to a different institution, and you'll probably have more free time.\n\nThat said, if you're wanting a graduate degree in STEM, then Caltech is an excellent place to go",

Some of the aid will likely be grants/scholarships, some loans, and some work study.  The end result is to knock down the indebtedness of the student before they graduate.  \n\nIt's work checking for the average indebtedness of all graduating student that receive financial aid rather than tuition plus expenses times 4.  Each school's financial aid department should have that number.",

People here get into the joint programs most years too, I know someone a year above me who is thriving. \n\nThat said, balancing everything to get to this point was very challenging (grade deflation is less of a thing when you get to junior/senior year classes because for bio majors, they tend to be seminars and presentation/journal club based, so your ability to work hard to write grant proposals and analyze papers will earn you A\u2019s with no difficulty). I was fortunate to have my parents cover my undergrad tuition too, and since you\u2019re pretty much financially independent afterwards with an MD/PhD program, in my mind it was a good investment. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve heard, premed guidance at larger schools tend to be less helpful and specialized, whereas I could meet with mine at Caltech a couple times a week throughout the entire application process. There are less people doing premed but enough people taking similar classes that it\u2019s not too bad, and you get that benefit from being at a smaller school. And most med schools know how hard it is here, but the ones I\u2019ve interviewed at thought very highly of the life skills like collaboration that we pick up as an undergrad. You get amazing opportunities for research too starting from summer of freshman year, so if the PhD is something you really want, they care more about that than just your clinical work. Just do well on your MCAT and decently well on organic chemistry (I got B\u2019s) and you\u2019ll be set.\n\nHowever, the big thing I worry about for you is that chemical engineering is infamous for being one of the hardest majors to do here. You need to have one hell of a work ethic and be willing to take a lot of late nights (it\u2019s probably up there in challenge with electrical engineering). It doesn\u2019t overlap in classes with premed requirement all that much either. Chemistry or BioE would probably be better ones in terms of workload if you\u2019re not picking pure Bio like I did.\n\nIf you like neuroscience, there are SO many upper level neuro classes that my bio major was almost half neuro\u2026.amazing professors too. You can get a degree in computational neural systems (CNS) as a premed too.",

I found it decently challenging even with my academically rigorous high school experience, but with more time in between classes to actually do work as opposed to being in class constantly\u2014especially after the first year or two. Bio made things easier in some regards too, but not easy enough to not take core classes like waves/quantum/stat mech or any of the 5 classes of core from physics and math. I was also a collegiate athlete so the bulk of my free time was spent studying so I could perform the best I could; that didn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t have hours in the day off. But I also had friends who weren\u2019t athletes in majors like EE and they nearly broke themselves with the workload (one teammate was an EE and during a term she would only come out of her room to eat and do necessities).\n\nHow efficiently you work can also play a role: I\u2019m terribly inefficient and I still survived, while my teammates who were exceptionally efficient got work done asap and got a week ahead in certain math classes, leaving them plenty of free time to play video games and goof off. I think that much of the conflicting experiences can be tied to how well individuals use the time they have and what they choose to do with it. Resources are always available so even if you\u2019re struggling with classes, office hours (especially core classes) are lifesavers and filled with your classmates too, whom you can collaborate with.",

Undergrad is a time of personal growth and discovery. Are you in love with either school does it make you excited and just feel right? That kind of thing can have an outsized impact on your end result. Caltech is not for everyone. It really really works for those it's made for. And can be tragic for those that aren't the right match.",

Note, the med school you will be paying for is going to stick you in much further debt than a degree that is useful after just a BS!\n\nAlso, it's common advice to not do a PhD at the same place you did your undergrad, so if your eyes are on a USC-Caltech MD-PhD don't come here.",

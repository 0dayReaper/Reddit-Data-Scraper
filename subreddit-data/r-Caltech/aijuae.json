    "postText": "Hello and thank you for reading/commenting. I was recently admitted into the CalTech chemistry PhD program, and I am concerned about some of the rumors I've heard. I understand that the program is competitive and demanding in the number/quality of published papers that Profs. require for graduation. However, are Profs. and the culture generally accepting and supportive of colleagues who have a little more work-life balance while maintaining high productivity?\n\nDo most labs have students staying late and working on the weekends every single week? How competitive/collaborative is the general culture there? Are students generally happy? Do students feel generally fulfilled and satisfied? Can students balance relationships with friends/family/SO? I'm happy to work 60 hours a week, but I like doing it at on my own schedule without worrying about appearing busy. I'm competitive enough to work hard to deliver a substantial number of results relatively to my peers, but I hate to sacrifice quick, day-to-day activities that make me happy just to appease my boss or work culture. Do students generally have a good dynamic between each other, or do students get butt hurt at each other, depending on whether or not they are making progress on their projects? Are students generally over-boasting about their work on their published works, or are students generally humble about sharing credit and working together?",

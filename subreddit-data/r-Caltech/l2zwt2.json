    "postText": "I was invited to interview at Caltech next month for bioengineering PhD program and I'm wondering what doing research at Caltech BBE is like!\n\nCaltech has always been my dream school since I have switched from automotive engineering to bioengineering. Most of my \"science crushes\" are at Caltech as well.\n\nWhat is it like doing research at Caltech BBE (or other programs)? What do grad students do during their free time? (Planning to get a pilot license lol not sure if that is manageable considering that I also spend a lot of time on my car, for pleasure driving)\n\nGosh thinking about the fact that I actually have a chance to do science Caltech makes me smile every time! Plus the amazing canyon roads around LA lol.",

            "comment": "I am a bioengineering PhD alumnus!  I will say that things changed significantly at the end of my PhD (BE joined Biology to form BBE near the end of my PhD), but if have any specific questions you can ask me directly.\n\nThat being said, Caltech is a great place for grad school, and all the faculty are excellent.  Do you have an area of focus or faculty you're interested in working with?  Research experience varies wildly by advisor.  \n\nWhat you do outside of research is really up to you. There's a lot of social events that you will be able to attend (once everyone gets vaccinated) like quarterly parties, department social hours, GUSH (graduate underground social hour) events once a month.  But beyond that it's up to you.  Los Angeles has a ton to offer, so my recommendation would be not to get completely stuck within the Pasadena bubble.  You have a car, so you'll be able to explore the city and find things you enjoy doing.   When I was in graduate school I learned to brew beer, to play the piano and how to make cheese.\n\nAnyway, I don't know how interviews are arranged now, but try and get the straight dope from the current graduate students in the program, specifically about potential advisors.  The best place to do that was when the students would take the prospective students out to the bars, so you'll have to prise that from them over zoom, I guess.\n\nOnce again, happy to answer any specific questions to the best of my ability.",

I\u2019m mainly interested in synthetic biology and develop biology (maybe a bit ml sprinkled in there too lol). Some of my \u201ccrushes\u201d are younger faculties that joined Caltech probably after you have left. But among the older faculties I\u2019m very interested in elowitz, and long cai. \nSuper excited about talking to the faculties and students at the end of February!",

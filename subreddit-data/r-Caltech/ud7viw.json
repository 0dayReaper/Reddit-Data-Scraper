I\u2019m planning the next phase of my life and want to make sure I have my ducks in a row. \n\n(Yes, I read the sticky)\n\nI\u2019m interested in doing a PhD program focused on spacecraft design at the mission conceptual level. What of the 4 qualifying exam areas make the most sense for that: Controls? Math? \n\nMy background: Military-&gt;JPL for two years-&gt;AeroE undergrad from a CSU. I\u2019m really interested in planetary science being what I describe as the \u2018capital\u2019 to conduct engineering tasks that yield more science. Then it\u2019s a loop.\n\nDoes anyone know of any advisors who would best fit for that kind of mantra?\n\nAnything else I should know about GALCIT? What is their overlap with KISS? \n\nThanks y\u2019all!",

            "comment": "Are you ultimately interested in running A-Team/Team X type studies at JPL, being a subject matter expert that gets brought into those studies, or being a PI that eventually leads flight projects? \n\nI agree with the other poster if planetary science is what interests you then GPS might be a better fit, but you could also look at all sorts of robotics people making different kinds of mobility platforms or instrument folks making the next generation of sensors. If you want to study mission design itself, something like systems engineering might actually be a better fit since their job is actually handling the integrations and managing the different sets of wants/needs from all the stakeholders (engineers of all disciplines, project scientists, etc).\n\nYou may also want to look into programs at JHU since there's similar sorts of orgs at APL and they're probably also well connected to NASA Goddard.",

                    "comment": "Hello! I used to do planetary science when I was at JPL (mostly outer solar system with some Mars surface stuff). I decidedly do not want to do that for higher education or as the sole focus of a career.\n\nHowever I am interested in Team X/A type stuff if I was working at JPL. Being a PI or some type of manager on flight projects would also be excellent. Past JPL: I suppose I am interested in systems engineering in general. I want to be able to design spacecraft that are best able to navigate whatever environments necessary to answer decadal survey questions. Additionally I\u2019d like to work at that mission concept/spacecraft pre phase A/Phase A design level for national security and manned spacecraft missions. So that would probably mean places Aerospace Corp, DARPA, Lockheed, NASA JSC, many others. \n\nI am all about finding engineering solutions to complete a task, whether it\u2019s science or a defense mission or human exploration. \n\nThis all might seemed scatterbrained, but I think I am at a weird point where my professional experience is larger than my academic and it\u2019s causing me to have a weird perspective.\n\nJHU is absolutely a consideration for me, as well as MIT. I don\u2019t really know where else would be a good fit for me though and I would appreciate any grey beards insight.\n\nThank you so much.",

Look at SURP schools; I know ASU has PIs for hardware and missions. There's also places adjacent to other NASA centers who probably are linked strongly the same way Caltech/USC/UCLA are to JPL.\n\nI think a question you have to ask yourself is do you want to move up the ranks by becoming a SME at some product development niche and try to worm your way into those developmental tasks that way, do you want to be in an org more like 34 or 38 who PI instruments/architectures where you can deal with things at a higher level, or if you want to be more directly hired into formulation as a systems engineer specializing initially in seeing the threads connecting all the different people.\n\nI'm a materials PhD who does manufacturing and work across the different orgs at JPL inventing things to solve problems for stuff launching anywhere from next year to 30+ years out. A colleague of mine leaned hard into A Team stuff because that's what he enjoys, and others have gone more into Team X because they liked more constrained problems and being able to rapidly develop bounding box solutions for a defined mission.\n\nIf you want to PI an actual mission/instrument, you need to learn how to Think Big and come up with totally novel solutions to questions posed by the decadal studies. Read NIAC proposals and try to learn how to think that way. Work for faculty who has won those sorts of things, so they can teach you about how they got where they are.\n\nLet me know if you want to go to DM, I'm happy to chat about my experience and the pros/cons I see of the various paths.",

            "comment": "MCE and it\u2019s been a few years, but I\u2019ll do my best.\n\nInfo on all the PhD requirements is in the (course catalog)[https://catalog.caltech.edu/documents/19918/caltech_catalog-2122-section_4_REV021022_E99OBS4.pdf], with the aero stuff on page 366. It\u2019s a math qual, and then choose 2 between fluids, solids, and controls. \nAero and MCE take a lot of the same classes their first couple years. There are pretty standard courses in math, fluids, and solids, so most people take those courses and then the Quals in the same subject. I don\u2019t know about aero, but MCE also offered a few other Quals that would fit those categories - a different math qual, several robotics Quals, etc. - and usually a few people would take those. It depends on your background, the classes you take, and what your adviser recommends. Caltech is such a small place that each year\u2019s \u201cmenu\u201d of offered Quals might change, but that also means that they will hold one just for you if you\u2019re the only one interested in that area.\n\nAFAIK, there\u2019s not a ton of mission planning work at Caltech. Your JPL coworkers might have a better idea. Pellegrino works in spacecraft structures, but many of the GALCIT profs are working on more traditional straight-up fluids or thermo. If you want to go planetary science, consider GPS. A number of them work more closely with JPL.\n\nKISS is a supplementary group that holds workshops and seminars. There are KISS fellows (some years, when there\u2019s money), but I believe they work with the individual departments to figure that out. It\u2019s not something that you apply for. \n\nMy suggestion: read through the bios of everyone in MCE, GPS, and GALCIT (many profs are cross-listed). Email those that have anything even slightly interesting and ask what you have here. Some will be willing to work with you, some won\u2019t. KISS might be helpful there too. Again, it\u2019s a small enough place that networking and going outside the formal application process is almost expected.",

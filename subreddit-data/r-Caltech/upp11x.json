    "postText": "Hi all, I'll be graduating from UCF in Orlando Florida soon with a Master's Degree in Thermofluid Aerodynamic Systems, and have been hoping to apply into Caltech's PhD program for a while. I've heard many great things about the research you do, and was curious if there are any known openings for a doctorate researcher in propulsion systems (mostly shock dynamics and characterization).\n\nSimilarly, I'm curious if the research done in this field at Caltech is done through JPL or in collaboration? If anyone knows who a point of contact would be I'd greatly appreciate it!",

            "comment": "Look for faculty in at Caltech putting out papers in stuff you're interested in and reach out to them individually. There are a few faculty on campus that do work up at JPL, but not many. \n\nJPL also doesn't do a whole lot of actual propulsion work. There's pretty much nothing on operating in an atmosphere, it's all having smaller probes for adjustments to trajectory, station-keeping, and long-life trust. Think of electric propulsion, some hybrid stuff, and some microspray sorts of stuff. You could look into apply for jobs directly at JPL; it won't get you a PhD, but you might be able to find some similar work of interest to you. There's been a lot of people leaving lately, so probably a good chance of a position currently being open or one will be in the near future.\n\nFinally, Caltech probably won't recognize your MS degree and you'll be required to repeat all your coursework.",

You might be able to get some credit, or be allowed to take more elective classes than the rest of your cohort, but you'll still likely need to redo coursework.\n\nI'll also say compared to my friends that went to similar peer schools for grad work, Caltech definitely had more rigor in their coursework.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am a 13-year old in 7th grade. My principal is sending me to [Abraham Lincoln High School](https://lincoln.sjusd.org/) for 9th grade. My goal is to get into Caltech, and I need some guidance on what to do. I know I want to be an electrical engineering major and, according to the college board, I need to finish 10 AP exams. Caltech does not give AP credit. Should I stress out about high school trying to self-study and finish these AP exams? My cousin-sister also skipped a few grades like me, and she said from experience it was very difficult for her. She took 12 AP exams in 4 semesters; not all of them were for her career. I also heard about something called \"post-high school\" but don't fully understand what it is. If anyone can give me some feedback on what to do at where I am right now and help me plan for my future, I'd love to enroll in Caltech and get an electrical engineering major, or maybe even link me to some courses I should take for the AP exams I'm taking [here](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/choosing-courses/major-career-results/major/Electrical-Engineering).",

Yes, you will want to take hard math and science courses and try to do well, but that's pretty much the only \"requirement\" to get into Caltech.\n\nThe best advice I have for you is don't be boring. Have some ambition in life that isn't necessarily a career. Caltech doesn't want to hear \"my dream is to go to Caltech\", they want to hear exciting stuff, like your passion for competitive bubble blowing or how you made a robot to automate making rice.",

I don't mean studying lots of EE textbooks -- that's not that useful anyway -- I mean go ahead and join an FRC robotics team, or do some hackaday things, or maybe get into amateur radio or something!\n\nIf you find a (mostly academic) hobby you love, and have things to show for it by the time you're a senior in high school, that will do *wonders* for your college application. And it doesn't have to be, like, exactly EE either...if you get into programming or 3D printing or quadcopter or modding or *anything* like that you can talk about, you will (1) have a big edge going into college, in a way that classes don't help so much, and (2) will look great on apps.\n\nGetting into Caltech is a great goal btw, but it should stay that: a goal, not a milestone that **must** be met. If you to go to another top school that's fine too, and focusing too hard on one school isn't really a great way to do apps or high school. I had my heart set on a particular top college through most of HS, applied early, didn't get in ....... realized I knew almost nothing about other colleges, and then ended up going to Caltech which I barely knew. And loved it. You might go to Caltech and love it, but maybe Caltech will reject you so you go to Princeton or Berkeley or somewhere else great. And that will be fine too! And pursuing your hobbies during HS will help you very much with *all* those schools.",

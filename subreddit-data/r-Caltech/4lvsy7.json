    "postText": "Hey folks. You probably get sick and tired of these, and yes, I have read your replies to the recent posts in similar vain.\n\nLike apparently everyone here, I have a 4.0 unweighted GPA, am planning on taking 9 or so APs, have a 1550 SAT score and am prepping for the SAT Math 2 and the SAT Physics. I plan on majoring in Physics, perhaps with a minor in aeronautics.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus seems to be that you should take your love of STEM *out* of the classroom and apply to college internships. This seems easy enough.\n\nHowever, a recurring theme seems to be \"president of school classs\" or \"vice president of the physics society\" or some similar white, upper middle class, suburban school association, all of which I do not have access to being homeschooled. Aside from internships, is there anything I should/can do to make up for this?\n\nBTW I am a freshman, entering my sophomore year.",

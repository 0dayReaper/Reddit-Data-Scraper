    "postText": "I wasn't planning on applying, but I just found out I have a perfect ACT score. Caltech has basically the highest test scores of any school, so I'm wondering: do Caltech admissions officers give more weight to scores than other schools? Or is it just that all students do amazing things to get themselves admitted, while also somehow having terrific test scores?\n\nI'm planning on doing engineering in college, but really don't have the amazing engineering background that one would normally expect of a top-tier engineering school applicant. (6th place in a tiny national competition, a one-semester engineering class, plus the normal AP Physics/AP comp sci/MV Calc etc, but that's it.) GPA 3.95, Weighted 4.65ish Just wondering if a 36 on the ACT is enough to make a decent application. Idk if it makes a difference, but I'm also a white girl.",

            "comment": "If your GPA is good then it's probably worth applying. I didn't have any AP science at all, and they still admitted me. Also most people didn't take mv calc before Caltech, so your coursework looks competitive. In some sense undergrad admissions are like a lottery, so if you have competitive stats and really want to go it should be worth applying. You don't need an amazing engineering background (pretty hard to get unless your school has a robotics team or your parents work in the industry), but mainly you need to demonstrate your passion for STEM. Plus you don't choose your major until end of frosh year.",

            "comment": "How's your GPA? Your other credentials sound good. I got into Caltech with near-perfect (but not perfect) SAT scores, a very high GPA (weighted for AP's), and AP's that included Physics and Calculus. I also scored well in state science competitions that mainly tested rote learning and test-taking skills. I did well on the AHSME one year but didn't get anywhere in the AIME, and the other times I took the AHSME, I might have gotten the highest score among my classmates but didn't qualify for the AIME.",

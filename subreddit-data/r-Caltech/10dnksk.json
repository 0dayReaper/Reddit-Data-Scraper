    "postText": "I was admitted REA and have heard conflicting things about what studying math as an undergrad is like at Caltech. The difficulty is not really a deterrent, but how difficult is it compared to other majors? Is it true that professors are better researchers than educators? And are core classes really designed to \"break you\" as a student? Any insight or advice is appreciated, thank you!",

If you like math enough to get through these it's fine. \n\nprofs better researchers than educators: Honestly I wouldn't say Tech is significantly worse than peer institutions in this regard. Math profs in general are just often not the best educators. You get used to it, and it's totally possible to learn the material you want. And some profs/postdocs are quite good actually.\n\nCore designed to \"break you\": it's designed to give you a broad foundation in the sciences to make you a better scientist. Not a torture device, unless you are disinterested in science. Also you take most of Core on p/f so it shouldn't cause too much stress",

            "comment": "Majoring in mathematics at Caltech is like trying to solve Fermat's Last Theorem while blindfolded and with one hand tied behind your back. It's going to be challenging, but that's what makes it fun. And, let me tell you, the professors at Caltech are like Nobel Prize winners on steroids. They're brilliant researchers, but don't expect them to hold your hand and walk you through the material. They'll throw you into the deep end and see if you can swim. And as for the core classes, let's just say that they're designed to separate the wheat from the chaff. But, if you're up for the challenge and want to be a part of the elite group of mathematicians who graduate from Caltech, then go for it. Just make sure you have a good support system in place, a lot of coffee, and maybe a therapist on speed dial.",

You get to take the chem courses p/f which is another core course that about half the class struggles a bit with. Besides those, the rest of core is actually very easy.\n\nThe math major at Caltech is large compared to basically every other school, and you\u2019ll also be taking graduate courses very quickly. Compared to other majors at Caltech its reputation is that it is conceptually very difficult, but the workload is not as bad as some of the other majors like ChemE or EE. With math the nice thing is that how well you do in math 5b is pretty indicative of how you will do in the rest of the major.",

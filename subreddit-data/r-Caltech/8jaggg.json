    "postText": "So, I'm planning to do premed in college and I'm considering Caltech. I'm definitely not afraid of hard work in college, but on average, how bad is the pre-med workload? Should I be concerned about spending all of my free time in the library and never getting enough sleep like what I've heard in the horror stories? Or is it not much worse than other schools?\n\nI definitely want to get into medical school, but I also really want to have a good time in my undergrad. I obviously don't expect to be having fun all the time, and I know that there will be really hard moments, but I'm hoping that I can be reasonably happy overall throughout my 4 years. How hard is it to achieve a work-life balance as a premed here?",

I know only a few premeds that don\u2019t regret in some academic manner their choice to come here (although many do like the school)... I would highly, highly recommend you stay far away from Caltech.",

Not to mention professors have their pick of the litter for research and a pre-med oriented student doesn't inspire as much confidence as a research oriented person.  There are exceptions of course, but there are so many colleges out there that have solid pre-med programs or even cater to them (small liberal art schools, for example).",

Having said that, it didn't seem to be unmanageable: I saw many pre\\-med students who participated in athletics and other extracurriculars while maintaining their academic priorities \\(incl. research, etc.\\). It is what you make of it. \n\nI do think work\\-life balance is achievable if you stay disciplined. Again, speaking from what I saw, the pre\\-med students definitely worked extremely hard but also had time for other things \\(including sleep!\\)\n\nIn the end, go where you feel most comfortable. A visit never hurts, if you can manage it :\\) ",

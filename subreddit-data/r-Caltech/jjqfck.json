I need to list all previous residences on an application, and I can't find the street address for Ricketts anywhere. On google maps, I can only find the coordinates. If anyone knows the address, can they please let me know. Thanks!",

Students usually have mail go to 1200 E California Blvd (Caltech's address) and specify their MSC (mailbox number). If it's just to list a residence, maybe writing \"Ricketts House \\\\\\\\ 1200 E California Blvd\" would be sufficient?",

    "postText": "I'm an incoming first year engineering student at the University of Toronto, thereby first year classes start for me in a few days, and I would like apply for a transfer application to Caltech but I'm a bit confused with the process.\n\nA few questions I have:\n\n\\- Can I apply right now, or do I have to wait till I complete first year?\n\n\\- Do I have to write the SAT?\n\n\\- How long does processing take for a transfer application?\n\n\\- What is the average scholarships given to students? - I understand that the value of scholarships differs per student and program, but as a Canadian student the system seems quite different to me and I don't have much of an idea of how much I'll have to pay if I get admitted.\n\nHelp would be greatly appreciated, thanks everyone!",

            "comment": "I see you have posted transfer questions for other schools too. I imagine that those schools, like Caltech, post their requirements clearly online. You can go to the websites of schools that interest you, rather than rely on redditors to do your homework for you.\n\nFor Tech, transfer details are at: https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/apply/transfer-applicants/application-requirements\n\nApplications are not due until February. Your application is likely to be more competitive if it shows you have taken and succeeded at [STEM courses that are equivalent to the first year curriculum](https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/apply/transfer-applicants/entrance-examinations-and-academic-prep). Theose pages don't list the SAT.  You will have to take entrance exams that are likely more challenging than the SAT. Transfer decisions are shared in May.\n\nFinancial Aid info is at: https://www.finaid.caltech.edu/howitworks\n\nGood luck with your applications.",

Further, there are on the order of a handful of transfer students per year, so the general populous just doesn't know how transfer applications work since we entered as first-year applicants.",
